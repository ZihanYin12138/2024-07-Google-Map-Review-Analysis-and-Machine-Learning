When you buy extra clothes out of the $10 you get 30% off. The people are super fun and i got some great stuff for $30 in all.

<text>Love The City Thrift Storage has a better collection of vinyls and other vintage items than your average thrift store. Aside from their vintage collection, they also sell kitchenware appliances , furniture and clothes. Very friendly staff, would definitely recommend checking this place out if you’re a thrift junky like I am and are interested in adding to your vinyl collection.< /text>< Pictures>

The workers here are really friendly and helpful.  Also the prices here cannot be beat! I'd say about half of my clothes are from here and still in great condition.  The $10 bag deal is the best deal I've ever found in Los Angeles<//text>

<Review>This is a solid, local place!! I went there for kids books and they had a great selection. Walked out with 24 books for only $12! Whoever was running the register was incredibly friendly and helpful. It's a small store, I heard him go above and beyond to help several customers in the 30 minutes I was there. I would definitely recommend trying this place out.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

If you love to dig through Stuff to find the treasure then this is your spot! I come here to buy glass vases for flowers. They have a lot of glassware and clothing plus a miscellaneous household things, books, children's things and some electronics.

It's not high end but I donate some good stuff so maybe once in awhile, LOL,. You will do some digging but I'm sure there's treasure to be found.<//text>

Even though they were having a 30% off sale on the furniture, there was nothing there I wanted. Also they charge tax if they are nonprofit why do they charge tax?<//text><rating>3</rating><username>Tika Rosenthal< /username><gmap_id>0x80c2ba16661561f5:0xf7d7e15492487ab9< /gmap_id>< user_id>

What a cute little thrift store. The store is not huge but they have a wide variety of items. They also do a special where anything off their normal racks (on the left side of the store as you come in from the street) that fits in a paper grocery bag costs $10. Friendly staff. Parking on the street or in back. I found several things and left having only spent $7.</review>

I pride myself on knowing all the amazing thrift store to get deals, some how this place excaped me! There are some great vintage finds from: clothing, furniture to fantastic glass's and dishes to choose from.
If you are looking for the unique and at a good price (so many thrifts are just over pricing their stuff today) this is the place to shop.
Put it on your list of go to spots!< /review>

Service is top notch. The staff are always very polite and get orders done quickly. The food however is even better. Fried rice is just top notch, the orange chicken is just even better!

If I had the option for 10 stars I would so take that option.</review>

<text>Came to buy 1 bowl that cost $6.80 and i was charged $21.22. Odalys charged me for 2 plates and told me that we can get the second plate free the next day even though I paid for the second plate. I don’t live in that area so I declined the offer I just wanted the extra money back, I was not being rude about the situation but, Odalys was being very rude for no reason. They gave us $12 back.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I had to wait 15 minutes for my food. The restaurant was very busy. Or maybe their short staff. There seem to be some confusion between the walk up customers and the people who ordered on line. People was walking up and jumping in  front of people standing in line.  Just because they order online, they can jump in ahead of everybody in line? The guy working in the front taking orders don't seem to know what was going on. Or perhaps he was being overwhelmed. He looked like he was new on the job. The restaurant needs better organization. The food was good.< /text>

For north county or any county or state that does not have good Chinese food then you can't go wrong with Panda.  Even till this day i rate there orange chicken as #1.  Better than P.F. Chang's for sure!</review>

<review>ok so its the super bowl and the employees are probably upset they have to work but they didn't get the order correct, apparently they have no white rice and I guess they are running short of food as they didn't give full portions.  the employees didn't care that they weren't filling the order correctly or that they didn't stock a Chinese food standard of white rice.  An apology would have been nice, service would have been better, having their normal food would have been great, all were absent< /review><Rate>1</Rate><user>113458776676333536053</user><GmapID>0x80dc713f803067b5:0xdddace30fb56f893<//GmapID>< pictures>

<Text>My first time coming to this panda and all I wanted was a medium cup . I was standing there for a good 10 minutes the cashier ignored me the whole time ! A lady next to me asked for the bathroom key cause she was also standing there waiting and I looked over at the cashier and she rolled her eyes the person cooking had to give it to her .. after that I left but that cashier shouldn’t be trying customers like that I will not be coming here again .< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc713f803067b5:0xdddace30fb56f893</Gmap_id></record>

Loved the service! The person serving us was Eduardo and let me tell you, that guy was super nice and pleasant to deal with! He also put such a huge portion of food that we all were able to eat only half! Compared to lots of other pandas I have attended,this one has had the best service and portions so far.<//Text>

<Text>Asked for rice, instead got chow mein. I also asked for a lemonade with no ice and they gave me a Dr Pepper first, and then gave me a water after I told them they screwed my order up.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc713f803067b5:0xdddace30fb56f893< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<Review>I ordered for my annual Christmas party held at my residence. I had 44 people and my order was done to perfection! All the guests enjoyed your food.

When I arrived to pick up my food, Austin, was so helpful and kind. He asked if I needed anything else and was so accommodating. He even carried my order and placed it the car for me!

Thank you so much for the great experience and I will highly recommended your catering services to my friends.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

After having placed an order online months ago that no one bothered to prepare for pickup, I decided to give this location another try.  This time I didn’t bother to order ahead but when I arrived at 7pm on a weeknight, there was barely any food available.  The chow mein and 3 of the 4 entrees I wanted were either completely gone or on their way.  The staff was nice enough but they just don’t seem to be on top of things here.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>This is the laziest Panda. They seem like every order is a challenge and too hard to do.. "Oh, we, don't have white rice...and we can't make more. I can mix what is left over from the white rice with the left over brown rice".

They always close up and stop making dishes long before the store closing time. The trays never have anything fresh, they have to make a new order of every item every time, then act like it is a big inconvenience for them to do so. And, when they aren't acting like that, they are telling us that they can't make something, because they don't anymore if some ingredient. Every time we go there, there is only one person taking orders, and one cook. The rest of the staff are always pretending to "clean" while they flirt with the Chipotle staff who come over and take their breaks inside of Panda Express. Horrible service.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Standard panda express. I have had lunch and dinner here multiple times and have never had a problem. Staff is always very kind and moves quickly. Double Orange Chicken and Chow Mein. Good stuff.<//Review>

Never a line when I get here in the mid-afternoon. Just as good as any other Panda. Bathroom was clean when I used it. 4 stars because a tiny thing of Orange chicken should not be over $4.....< /text>

What's the point of ordering online, being guaranteed a time to pick up, then still having to wait 20 minutes while everyone else is being helped, including online orders that came in after mine. Not to mention the girl working didn't even acknowledge me, and finally, after almost 10 minutes,  another worker stepped in to help. Finally got home, to a bag full of spilled teriyaki sauce because the lid wasn't on. I even specified we didn't need teriyaki sauce. Very disappointed and frustrated with this location.<//Text>

Managers continued to take orders while food was out of stock resulting in 15 people paying for food and standing around. Your restaurant is setup like an assembly line, operate is as such. This was unacceptable.<//review>

<Review>Lady's exact words were "Don't use the or play with the buttons, it messes up the controls." She then promptly turned it off. These game machines lasted through the 80s. Why have games if you can't play them? Second time coming here, last time she was yelling at another person. She also let's dogs in the place.  Won't be back.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I have been to several laundromats in my life (61 years old), the wonderful lady that I've watched work here keeps everything spotless. She said everyone is expected to do the same. I've only seen her since I always go at the same time/day every week, but I am truly truly impressed.<//Review><response>None<//response>< user_id>

Glad I made the choice to come here . Lady that was here the night I came was very nice and I saw that she was wiping down after every person . I was on the phone with my boyfriend telling him how I wasn’t going to have enough to ride the bus home . And she gave me a Christmas envelope and said “merry Christmas “ and when I opened it it was quarters for my wash made my night !! Thank you Launderland !! Will definitely be coming back<//text>

<Review>Have signs posted inside saying to leave a washer or dryer in between each person for social distancing. But I asked Aren't they supposed to skip a washer or dryer. And i was told that we could use any dryer we wanted didnt have to be too and bottom. Then the lady got mad when I pointed at the sign. And said then what is the point of having that up there if YOU are not going to follow it. I GIVE UP!< /Review><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80946746daeef591:0x9fb3509b8bf21ec2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love this place. Someone is always on site. Place is always clean. They are all very nice, helpful & friendly there, customers as well as staff. They stay open later than most places. They've always had enough basket carts to go around. & I love their variety of multi-load machines. Never a bad experience here.<//text>

Dry is only 20 cents. The owners keep the place VERY clean, even cleaning out the washers and dryers after most every use. Clothes always come out clean unlike other places.< /review>< userid>

<Text>Clean and friendly place. The detergent dispenser on the washers doesn't work. Safe place to be in as of this moment😁. Loving this area because it doesn't close until 11pm. For late night washing... this is the place for you! 5 stars!< /Text>< name>

I only come to this laundry mat, it's clean and a attendant is always there. I only come when the lady attendant is there because she super nice and friendly and my daughter loves her. I am and will continue to be a loyal customer.< /text>

< Review>
A washing machine and dryer is just a washing machine and dryer,  the same at every laundry mat.  What this place has that the others do not is Frances a daytime attendant as well as Psychologist,  social worker,  accountant,  security officer,  janitor,  story teller,  and one great human being!  She's why I choose this paticualr Fold n Fluff over the rest and if you pay attention to all the little conversations with in the building you know that's why everyone else is at this paticualr one too.  Never before have I seen it where EVERY SINGLE PERSON in there knew the attendants name and she knew all of there's!  Like Cheer's except here the suds are only Soap!</Review>

I for one am glad Bells Giodana won't be back.  She smelled worse than the dogs that were in there and she broke the video games. They last thru the 80's but not through her. Oh and she kept asking everyone for detergent. Needy. Bring your own things.<//Text>

My cat had a seizure and was freaking out- they were incredibly sweet and informative and caring. I highly recommend this place. The Dr. took a good amount of time explaining what it could be and how to look at his blood work- something my vet had not... sad to hear other people had bad experiences. It is affordable and convenient. I am so happy they are there for emergencies. Thank you!< /Review>

I called to confirm their hours for emergency. Lady that answered did not seem concerned about the emergency that I was experiencing with my dog and she said “see were about to close in 30 minutes“. I then stated that the website says they’re open till 8 AM and it’s currently 7 AM. And then told herNever mind I’m shooting up the phone. If that’s the kind of service I get on the phone what kind of service will I get for my dog. My vet recommended this clinic however I will never consider them again.<//review>

<review>I have had really good service here.
My dog is allergic to bees, and loves eating them. (I can't get him to look into that logic).

I must say the vet tech. Eric was beyond empathic...

The estimate was clear
Service is good
Fee's reasonable
Clean facility

The neighborhood is lucky to have a place to go when the vet isn't open.<//review><Rating>5</Rating><name>Kellie Patry< /name><gmap_id>0x80c2c148ce838d95:0xbfd96fa955860b3</gmap_id>< UserId.>

I had the worst experience ever, I had called for two weeks straight in regards to my cats tests results but no one answered the phone. It would just ring. I finally went and asked for the test results which they received two days after my first visit. I then asked why I hadn’t recieved a call and noticed them I called many times. They told me they were open and close for renovations throughout those two weeks. I asked the receptionist for the tests results and I waited for an hour and when she finally gave them to me I asked what they said as I am not a vet. She was only a receptionist and didn’t know what she was saying or understand what was on the results. I would not recommend going there! The place has changed and they do not care about your pet at all just about making money!< /review>

These guys are always there when you need them.  They don't overcharge and they are honest about what to do.  Be aware that they take cases in order of severity *not* first come first served.</Review>

Incredibly caring people. We lost our elderly dog today (16 years), but it was handled with great respect for us and our pet. I am incredibly grateful to these people and to the wise and very kind Dr Kim Paulosky. These are the sort of level headed emergency workers you want to see when the circumstances require it.</Review>

Awful! I spent $30 on a Uber to get my sick terrier here for an emergency last night and it was closed! They did not bother to change online that it is closed for 2 -4 weeks! It says 24 hours! I also called them and it just rang so I figured they were busy! Once I had already arrived and saw they were closed, I called again and someone decided to switch the voicemail on saying that they are closed for 2-4 weeks! I saw a light on inside so I think someone was there. I will never come back here again. Waste of time and the Uber! Worst of all my puppy is still sick so I had to wait to take him to his regular Dr. today.<//text>

<Review>Our 3 ½ year old Rottweiler, Olive, was very sick with sever diarrhea and vomiting. She had blood in her stool and couldn’t keep anything in her stomach; she’d take a drink and immediately throw up. We took her to Eagle Rock Emergency Vet Clinic at 3 am on a Saturday morning. We were very fortunate to get there when there were no other patients and after completing a simple short form, we didn’t have to wait to see the vet.

Dr. Susan Katila was the veterinarian on staff and she was so great. She clearly understood our angst and how worried and freaked out we were and she very quickly made us feel comfortable and confident that she understood our feelings. She also very quickly made Olive feel at ease, she was on the floor with her and soothing her as she examined her. It was obvious that she truly cares.

Dr. Katila’s diagnosis and treatment were exactly what we were hoping for, she treated Olive with an IV of fluids to ensure she was properly dehydrated and gave her a shot for her vomiting and diarrhea. When she was satisfied that Olive was in no danger, we left with antibiotics and probiotics and Olive is doing better.

A very special thank you to Dr. Katila, and the entire staff that was there the night we had to make our first trip to an emergency pet clinic. Everyone was very kind and understanding and helpful and even in all of our worry and stress, they made us feel as comfortable as possible.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>We had a great experience. The front desk person (it was a Saturday) just really knows what she's doing. We waited two hours (it's first come, first served unless a true emergency) for our dog to be put under to have an object removed from her ear. We were given a range of possible costs, depending on what happened/was found. Our dog is very nervous and she handled the experience as well as could have been expected. The waiting area is lacklustre but the vet care was great.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I would avoid this clinic at all costs. Our vet called this clinic to ask for overnight monitoring for our dog, who was acting funny but had no diagnosis. We were assured by both our vet and the vet tech that this placed was prepared to take our dog and that they were waiving the consult fee because our vet had called them. We show up, and as soon as we check in the front desk calls over the attending vet who said “we can’t take your dog. We don’t do neurology here.” We were very surprised because our vet and vet tech both had spoken to the clinic and assured us they were prepared to take her. Another vet came out, and she was immediately defensive, claiming that our vet had lied to us and that she only gave them a pricing, and never agreed to take her.

At this point, we are very confused because either this vet is lying to us or our vet was. This vet did not handle this well. She got in our faces (within 7 inches) and starting talking aggressively, saying she never agreed to take the dog and that they were busy anyway. Then, she aggressively LAY her hands on BOTH my boyfriend and me while she was yelling at us.

I would never take my dog here. They are liars and apparently willing to batter people to cover up their lies. I will be reporting this vet to the AAVSB about this vet’s totally unprofessional and unacceptable behavior.</Review>

I have had to go here for many of our pet's since I was very young. Over the years (40+) people come and go but one thing is always the same the compassion they have for animals. At times I have waited hours before we were seen due to other animals are/were worse they ours but the last time was no wait. All by luck.
The pricing of course is higher than if you were to go to you regular vet but something's just can't wait. Most importantly is the care you will get for your animal and I know that I can trust them with our little ones.< /review>

<text>I recently came here with my distraught girlfriend about her cat that was in bad shape. The cat was lethargic, in pain, weak, and the cause was unknown. This kitty was very loved, she was treated well and yet was still prone to something. The moment we arrived the lady in the front desk reacted to the cat being so motionless. I commend her for her sense of urgency but that is where the praise ends. Instead of running a check that is covered by the consultation on what the cat has, instead of giving us options, instead of trying to work with us on figuring some way to get the cat stable, they confront us with a request for a deposit of $500. They didn't treat the cat or offer to run simple blood work or any alternative tests to see which ones we could do and only told us what we already knew, the kitty was in shock. They insisted that treatment or even testing was going to be at least $1000 and only after seeing our face of despair did they offer euthanasia. If you come here be prepared to drop money before they give your pet stabilizing treatment or even a cheaper option. They will not offer alternatives or cheaper options. They will not do payment plans. Money is priority here.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c148ce838d95:0xbfd96fa955860b3<//GmapID></record>

This is a genuine emergency facility to take your animal in the middle of the night for a real emergency. They are only open when most vets are closed, something like 8pm to 8am, but don't quote me on that. They are very kind but more importantly they understand triage and know what do in an emergency situation. You can call them if need be and tell them your situation and they might be able to give you advice if you unsure how to proceed. Its not cheap, but they'll tell you costs as quickly as they can. They don't over charge as far as I'm concerned. Expect to pay minimum $300 if they begin to work on your animal. They are very competent and they truly care, but just understand bills can get high very quickly so tell them if you have limited funds. We feel lucky to have to this place so close. We've had to use them a few times and I don't know what we would have done if they weren't around.<//Text>

I had to come in late Sunday night after I came home and found that my sweet chihuahua mix had a swollen face. The staff here were extremely friendly and helpful- from my panicked phone call to my in office visit everyone I came into contact with was sweet, calm and responsive. They were very gentle with my babe, and for an emergency service vet office I found their pricing extremely reasonable.</Text>

< Review>
I have been to Eagle Rock many times and have always been impressed with the professional care that my pets were given.

I hope I don't need to go back, but if I do I know they will take good care of my babies.< /Review>

Emergency vets are always a tough go. I like the staff at Eagle Rock, very compassionate and the doctors are kind but honest in their assessments. Their prices are also pretty fair, IMO, more so than other vet ERs I have been to.< /text>

I took my dog for emergency they didn't let me inside and obviously my dog can't talk so he can't say what's wrong with him I told them to run all the tests on him they said that my dog has to stay overnight and the next they they told me they had to sedate him again that because he was in so much pain but when I went to pick him up they had me wait for almost an hour and they said oh he's sleeping and I just said then why didn't they tell me on the phone instead of making me come as soon as they called they did not return his walking leash either they gave me one that was nothing compared to his leash and when I brought home my dog he was so sedated that he couldn't even walk he came back worse than when I took him</Text>

My small dog ate a mysterious poison and was going into some sort of catatonic seizure that seemed to be causing her extreme pain. Due to the seriousness of her condition, the doctor treated her immediately and kept her overnight. They saved my dog's life without even being able to pinpoint what was ingested and this was after numerous drug and toxicology tests. They worked quickly and were honest with me about all possible outcomes. I couldn't be happier with the professionalism and overall kindness that this knowledgeable staff possess.</Text>

I recently had to take my cat here. It was, of course, very expensive, it being an emergency situation, but the staff could not have been more helpful through the whole process. They even tried their best to work with me about cost. I'm very thankful for their work and their humanity.

Thanks, everyone, and a special thanks to Eric!</Review>

The worst experience in a pet clinic!!  I took my dog for urgent care went there because was close where a live. They made us wait for almost two hours jus for examination and nobody came to say anything to explain why they were talkings long to see my dog what we did was just paying the 85 dlls for examination. Was a waist of time and money. What is more, they never apologized. I would never recommend this clinic.<//text>

The dr Carla is the worst ever  she did less things than the nurse and wait time was way long even my dog feel a sleep it took her about 2mins to check my dog and expected me to pay 85$  for her 5 min check up her  excuse was that she was scared of my dog  how can she be a dr for animals and be scared of a dog that’s the worst excuse ever not  even the nurses where scare Plus their prices are insane. They gave me two quotes one of 260 and the other of almost 400$ never going back again.</review>

Over the phone I explained what happened. The receptionist conveyed the situation to the DVM, who suggested we come in. As soon as we arrived, they took our dog in to induce vomiting, while I filled out the paperwork. From the assistants to the doctor to the front-office person, everyone was professional and understanding of the situation. And the cost was very reasonable for a Sunday evening at 8 p.m. Hopefully we won't need to go back, but should we have another emergency, this is where I'd take our pet.< /Review>< Pictures>

I brought a dog in yesterday that had belonged to a homeless woman and had been hit by a car, the poor dog was suffering.
I drove all over to find a 24 hour hospital, meanwhile the dog was in terrible pain. Finally I found this clinic and as I walked in the woman at the counter rudely said “No we are not taking anything.” I explained the situation and she turned the poor dog away, said I needed to pay for everything up front and leave a 500 dollar deposit. This woman didn’t seem to care that an animal was in pain, she had the means to stop his pain yet chose money over humanity. There was no apology, no warmth, just told me to go to the shelter.  I went to North Central Animal shelter where he was greeted with kindness and they thanked me for helping the poor little guy. This happened at almost five o-clock, had North Central Animal shelter closed, this poor dog would have suffered to death. Eagle Rock animal hospital prefers profit over kindness, I understand that it’s a business but human kindness and descency to animals should be priority number one.</text>

I  just want to say thank you to Eric, who I belive is the nurse! My cat, Tygrys, is exrimaly scared and afraid of people and won't let anyone to pet him. He got really sick and needed to be under I.V. for a few days and  transported between day and night clinics. I came to visit and feed my cat and Eric came to talk to me. When he hold my cat, the cat trully was comfortable with him. I have never seen my cat being so comfortable with a stranger, he always runs away. I understant that he couldn't run away in the clinic, but he was really happy on Eric's hands! The whole hospitalization experience was so stresful for my cat, so thank you Eric for being so amazing!</Text>

< Review>
This clinic would rather let a pet suffer than accept a payment from another family member for emergency surgery. My brother needed to have emergency surgery on his cat that would cost between $1000 - $2000+. Insurance will cover it once he declares the expense, but we have to pay upfront. My brother unfortunately did not have this disposable income so he called me for help and was referred to eagle rock from the initial testing clinic who recommended immediate emergency surgery. I live in Chicago and cannot get to LA in time (At midnight), but gave my brother all the necessary credit card information he needed to pay for surgery thinking we live in a modern world with global financial practices....BUT They would not let him pay as he is not the cardholder and they refused him when he asked them to talk to me (the cardholder) on the phone and accept my information needed, including my ID card, and a signed letter of authorization, which they didnt have.
WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION LETTER FOR THESE SITUATIONS!? ITS STANDARD PRACTICE!
They were not interested and turned him away, giving him the name of other clinics to call. This all at 10pm when my brother is freaking out and having to drive through L.A to find someone who accepts my card or has an authorization form and time is of the essence. My brother has payed over $1200 dollars already and is desperately trying to save his cat. After all. We own pets as companions, care about our animals, and they become family.

Shame on you Eagle Rock! This is when people need you most and especially when time is a big factor for survival. Feel free to message me if you have an answer as your reasoning you gave my brother was laughable and quite frankly a joke. I own 2 businesses and never in my life have not accepted payment because I was scared a client would ask for their money back... People in this world may sometimes be dishonest, but maybe work on your business controls and processes because not having a credit card authorization form for situations like this FYI, is archaic for 2018.
Thankfully, I enjoy staying up until 2am on a Wednesday/Thursday night when I have to get up tomorrow at 7am. Well thats what family is for, and our pets are family.

Another clinic not too far away had a credit card authorization form and we are crossing fingers and praying that toot the cat will be ok by tomorrow.

Disclaimer: Now just so you all know this is not just a rant that doesn't take all factors into consideration. This review DOES NOT describe their medical abilities and or discredit any of the positive reviews on this page. It also doesn't speak to the clinics know how, as I am sure their doctors are more than capable and educated in their field. This is however, the first impression they gave. THE WORST in my opinion, as it should be pet forward thinking. So if you want to save your pet or have an emergency. Go somewhere else, as they wont work with you to find a solution if it doesn't fit their limited business know how. If you have no constraints as a pet owner, and need or want to come here, then great! I hope they are better with their care than they are with their customer service when it comes to emergency situations. JUST READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS. You will see a pattern!</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>This clinic is terrible. I took my puppy in because she got a plant in her ear. They wouldn't let me go back with him while he was being treated. They charged me $225 to remove a small foxtail, and said that it required sedation. My puppy is the calmest puppy and if I had been with him there would not have been any sedation required. The sedation made him very ill. I took him to the vet ( a different, legitimate vet) the following week as his ears were still sensitive. He had an ear infection because of what they did at the emergency clinic.

Also, regarding payment, I did not have the right payment method with me at the time and was told to call and pay over the phone later. I called several times but was told that there was no one there to take my payment. THEN I got a letter from a collection agency regarding the payment!

Also, by the way, while I was waiting in the waiting room for my dog to be treated, there were a couple disturbing things that happened. One, there was a very seriously injured dog that was literally bleeding all over the floor and the staff at the vet clinic asked the owner if the dog was "seriously injured"? And if he could "take him somewhere else" as maybe it was not an emergency. This was so sad, as there was literally blood all over the floor and the dog was very obviously in pain. Also, out of the three other people that came in with their pets, ALL THREE left without them, as in , they were put to sleep.

This clinic is scary, unethical, and does more harm than good for your animal.<//Review>< pictures>

We had to wait for hours in the freezing cold waiting room, the vet accused us of not properly looking after our puppy (who is treated like a little prince in our house), and then they gave us an enormous bill!!!

This is the kind of place you hope you never have to go back to even when you get 5 star service. That said I would go out of my way to avoid this place in the event I need dog ER services again. For starters the lobby was filthy. There was pee all over the floor with boo attempt to clean it in the hour that we were there.

The vet had pretty much the worst bedsude manner I've seen. He was a short guy with black hair, didnt catch his name, I'm not sure he even told us. Zero effort to greet our dog or put her at ease. He did a pretty thorough exam, but didnt seem to listen to us at all. He might be a decent vet, but should probably be kept away from the people that come in with their pets.

I will seek out another pet ER if I ever need one.< /Text>

They only care about profit, not about saving animals.  On July 2012, I took my dog there, she was in pain because one of her puppies got stuck and made it impossible to deliver the other 3 or 4 puppies inside her.  They couldn't be sure how many.  They said one thing and changed the diagnosis the next minute.

First they told me I had to pay $2,300 dollars and I had to give them a $1000 downpayment and said that all the puppies died.  Later they said they were still alive.  The doctor there was putting a lot of pressure on me and my family by saying that she was not gonna make it and they not gonna do something to save her if we dont pay the all the deposit i offer to pay $800dllr and later the rest but they didnt accetp it. My puppy was my mother's who passed away 2 months earlier asking us to take good care of her pet.  The clinic staff knew that because I told them how special my puppy was and I think that helped them to put more pressure on us to find the way to pay.

That much money falling out of the sky like that is ridiculous.  My dog was in pain, and if we don't pay $1000 right away the vets were willing to let her die.  We begged them to let us take to a different pet hospital in Los Angeles, but they refused, making a lot of excuses.  Finally we found a way to make the downpayment but people are sometimes not ready for this kind of situation, especially on a sunday!

Later that night I received a call saying that my puppy was ok and that I have to pick her up at 8am the next morning with the rest of the money!  We tried to explain that we need more time, banks only give $500.00 A DAY and don't open until 10am.  This guy called Erik told me that "IT WAS SO SAD TO PUT IT TO SLEEP AFTER ALL THE MONEY WE PAID AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE!"  I can still hearing his sarcastic voice in my ear.  So we decided not to give up on my puppy and went to the police station.  We didn't even know if they can help or not!  They helped, thank God.  A Police Officer talked to this "pet doctor" and suddenly this guy became very polite.  We ended up paying only $1300.00 total . They can't keep our love ones or or put them to sleep because people can't pay.  That is hearthless and is a  randsom!  We didnt refuse to pay, we just needed more time.  And these people are supposed to help and save animals.  They only care about money!!  HOPE MY STORY HELPS and don't let this clinic continue with this.

Special thanks to officer Gaglione and officer Austin from L.A Police Department.  God bless you guys and thanks for helping and doing your job.< /Review>< resp>

<review>Ed Millet came across as honest, friendly, and reasonable. I truly believe we lucked out in getting him a sales representative. I don’t know anything about solar. Ed took his time and educated us on the industry. He is an outstanding salesman. Thanks Ed! Looking forward to getting our panels installed.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>Roof Replacement
Avoid this business. They did a bait & switch on us, then tried to convince us that the lesser quality materials used were of equal or better quality. I explained to them that we agreed to premium quality materials at a premium price. They delivered and installed a lesser quality material. When I called them on it, several of their staff tried to convince me that the lesser quality material was just as good. Four people from their office came over to my house to explain to us that we got what we agreed too. They presented the original contract that we had signed to show that we agreed to a lesser quality material. I then presented my copy of the contract. My copy of the contract no longer matches the original contract. They had altered the original contract without our knowledge or permission to reflect a lesser quality material. I asked them to lower the overall cost to reflect the lesser quality material that they had already installed on my house. They refused to lower the price, so I had them remove the entire roof for a second time and start over again with material that I agreed upon first.
Additionally, no inspections were made and no permit was taken out until I called them on not pulling a permit. The job was completed and then a blank permit was delivered to my house. As of this writing, no city inspector has inspected the already completed job.
I have already filed formal complaints with both the Better Business Bureau and the Calif. State contractors licensing board.

I have worked at Quality First Home Improvement for a number of years. I am so confident in our quality work, and products, I had my roof replaced and adding more solar to my home.  Then, Quality First did Tex Cote. The project pictures are below<//review>

I enjoyed Joe's presentation about his company and the knowledge sharing of text cote. He was very professional and knowledgeable about the product he is selling. He explained things and the process very clearly.  I definitely highly recommend you reach out to Joe if you are interested in his company's product! I really like their tex cote!</Text>

<text>Ed Millet was very knowledgeable and familiar with variants of work that company does. I was impressed by the details of the work that he still remembered with the previous owner of our house. I am so glad that he gave a thorough step thru how we are going to take care of our solar project! Also, best thing that he was not pushy like other salesman! I hope to get to work with Ed soon I clear few items from my side. Thank you Ed!<//text><username>Manjeet Phul< /username>< date>

Roof Replacement
Avoid this business. They did a bait & switch on us, then tried to convince us that the lesser quality materials used were of equal or better quality. I explained to them that we agreed to premium quality materials at a premium price. They delivered and installed a lesser quality material. When I called them on it, several of their staff tried to convince me that the lesser quality material was just as good. Four people from their office came over to my house to explain to us that we got what we agreed too. They presented the original contract that we had signed to show that we agreed to a lesser quality material. I then presented my copy of the contract. My copy of the contract no longer matches the original contract. They had altered the original contract without our knowledge or permission to reflect a lesser quality material. I asked them to lower the overall cost to reflect the lesser quality material that they had already installed on my house. They refused to lower the price, so I had them remove the entire roof for a second time and start over again with material that I agreed upon first.
Additionally, no inspections were made and no permit was taken out until I called them on not pulling a permit. The job was completed and then a blank permit was delivered to my house. As of this writing, no city inspector has inspected the already completed job.

This review is for the sales portion. Joe Heilman did a great job. He walked  us through the process of how panels are installed on the roof, how electricity is gathered by different inverters & how it is fed into the PGE grid. He used our electricity usage (kWh) history to determine the number of solar panels needed and  he came up with a quote based on this number. He explained how ROI is calculated on our investment and arrived at our break even point. He described the tax credit that we could avail of to lower our total cost. He patiently listened to our questions and answered them politely. He explained various discounts that were available to us without being pushy. Overall I was very happy with Joe’s presentation.<//review>

<text>Ed Millett came to our house today to give us a no pressure quote for installing Solar after Chris stopped by our house over the weekend to introduce Quality First and we were so impressed. Both Chris and Ed made an amazing first impression and were extremely helpful and personable. Ed took his time to walk us through what it would look like if we were to go with them and explained the entire process in such simple terms. He was extremely knowledgeable on Solar and the installation process and answered all of our questions with such ease. We haven’t made a decision yet but if we decide to move forward with Solar, we will definitely call Ed at Quality First!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>A salesperson came by my house and did a sales pitch in the middle of the day. I avoid any company that resorts to these solicitation practices on principle, but this person was NOT wearing a mask during a pandemic. Says a lot about the company.
Can't comment on their work but I'll avoid them and I'd advise everyone to avoid them as well. Seems like there are multiple branches of this company and I'm reviewing this one since it is closest to my house. If it isn't this business I'll delete the review.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< review>
I’ve had work done by quality first, and also had them provide estimates for other jobs. I find that they use high quality labor and get the job done very quickly. The only downside is that their prices tend to be on the higher end of the scale.
All that said, I had a very pleasant experience with their sales rep today and would reach out to them again in the future.</review>

Worst company I have ever worked with!  My husband wanted to install solar panels with them, and they talked us into paying $5,000 dollars more to cover our well , but it never covered the electrical needs of the well.  When we complained about that, and a leak in the roof as a result of the installation process, they never returned our calls.  Even though they assured us they would fix any problems with the roof as a result of their work, they are now claiming it is not their problem.  We are going to have to sue them to get them to get them to meet their responsibilities.  There are many reputable solar companied out there - do not go with this one!!<//text>

<Text>We found Ed to be very authentic and knowledgeable about home repair.  He listened carefully to our questions and spent time explaining the various services available from Quality First  Home improvement.  He did not pressure us when we explained we were not ready to have our house painted at this time.  However he explained the many options available in terms of payments and shared the discounts we were available for given Jerry’s military service an my job as a teacher. We will definitely use these services when we are ready to have our house painted.  We enjoyed our  time spent with Ed.

Tom showed up on time to give an estimate on some insulation.  He had great feedback on some other ways to reduce energy consumption.  We ended up upgrading some of our windows and the quality of the product was great and installation was painless.  Tom wasn't pushy at all, and in fact discussed options for reducing costs and only seemed interested in finding the best solution for our family.< /review>

Part One: Ed was super informative and knew his products and services. Off to a great start. Will add more with other updates. I would give Ed 5 stars for starting off the process. 07/14/2020

Part Two: The Co-Ordinator was suppose to call and reschedule a site visit or something like that. It’s been a month and I’ve not heard from anyone after Ed’s initial visit. 4 stars here. 08/14/2020

Part Three: Almost 2 more weeks have passed and no contact from coordinator at all. I started with a five star review. A month later changed it to 3 star, another 2 weeks later changed it to 2 star. More importantly they might have missed out on a bigger project of Tesla Powerwalls. 2 stars here. 08/25/2020

Part Four: Finally got a message about back ordered solar attic fan and possible appointment date to install the fan. I’m upgrading the review to 4 stars. I would say here that Quality First gives themselves plenty of time on the contract. The way it’s worded it that they get in touch with you 30 days out and another 60 days to complete the project. I feel like that’s a long 90 days if you are wanting to install something on a shorter turn around time. My attic was boiling in the middle of July and not so much now over months later. I jee that in mind. Updated to 3 stars. 9/18/2020

Part Five: Installer showed up fairly on time for the schedule and my house is a 2 story and this guy had no tall ladder for the 2nd story. He dropped off the fan, solar panel etc. He said he’ll be back the next day. Showed up again with another person and could not decide where he wanted to mount the fan. Left without installing it. All he said was talk to the coordinator and see if he could offer a different solution. Very disappointed to say the least. Wasted the whole summer.< /text>

I found this company in the Diamond Certified directory and found them to be very professional. Met with their salesperson who did a complete inspection of my house. I was looking for replacement windows and received a quote on the spot. They also recommended some other energy saving tips, like adding more insulation in my attic.
I would definitely recommend them if you are looking for a top notch home improvement company.< /Review>

<Review>They installed my windows over a year ago for almost $4000 and broke multiple blinds in the process. Now one of my windows won’t close and it’s been a month since I filed a complaint with Kevin and I haven’t heard back. I will never ever go to these people again.

I will be filing a complaint with Diamond Certified. Nikhil the sales person assured us this is was a trust worthy company and they are not. I have never had a company take advantage of people like this before.

Their customer service is the worst I have ever received.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Quality First Home Improvement did my roof and added more solar to my home the first part of this year. The roof was done in three days. Amazing job. Because of that work, last month, QFHI did Tex-Cote for my home.< /Review>

<text>Quality First Home Improvement, Inc is an excellent company to do your home improvements. Quality products that last a long time at a quality price. If you are looking for that one stop contractor that can supply all your major contracting needs like roof replacement, solar, paint, HVAC, window and door replacement then look no further. The one thing they wont do is sell you a pinto, when it comes to the product and services you will get a Lamborghini at an SUV price, unless your looking for an Ferrari F60 then you might have to negotiate... All fun aside give them a look and get a quote, they might surprise you and help that dream of a home improvement come true. Many of my neighbors have and more and more of them are choosing quality first for there home improvements.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Nikhil was very professional and thorough with his explanations. I had remembered the competitive quote I had from a previous contractor and when Nikhil was describing the other options and costs, he was very fair in his comparisons which I appreciated (he is not the stereotypical car salesman). The Tex Cote  product looks very robust and the warranty proves that the company is ready to stand behind it. I am very glad I was home when Quality First knocked on my door!< /text>< response>

<text>Ed Millet came over because I expressed interest in learning about getting a new roof and solar system.
I soon learned how little I knew about what it takes to get a good roof, and a solar system.
Very patiently, Ed explained the advantages and disadvantages of different scenarios, and answered all my questions.
I know his ultimate goal is to sell his product, but he presents his case in a way that respects one’s intelligence. This is very important to us.

We are still crunching numbers, and trying to decide if thi is the right time fo us to embark on this project.
Regardless of whether we decide to do it soon, or next year, we will be contacting Ed. His honesty has earned our respect and our business.

Once they have your number will never let you alone even when they can't help you, if you want something different from their options.They will say they can do a different option over the phone but when they get to your house they will say they can't do it and waste your time.

They will not put you on the do not call list no matter how many times you ask them. They will think you forget after a few months and call you again and again trying to waste your time and try to talk you into something that you don't want. They are harassers! Avoid at all costs!</text>< rating>

Spectacular company. Its not just in their name but also in the work they do.From the products they carry to the actual installation of the job, quality first is spot on. I definitely recommend anyone who's looking to upgrade anything on their home to consider this diamond certified company. The professionalism they exhibit during the in home consultation process really separates them from the everyday "chuck with a truck" contractors that gives quick and vague estimates for the sub par work they do.Its really a breathe of fresh air to see a company so dedicated to customer service and always going the extra mile to ensure they have happy customers.Keep up the good work Quality First, the home improvement industry needs a company like yours to set a standard for servicing the public.<//review>

<text>I called Quality First about aluminum lattice structures after seeing their product at the State Fair.  They were excited to talk to me and we scheduled a time for them to come out and give me an estimate for replacing the two structures we have in our HOA.  They never showed up or called to tell me they weren't coming.  I called them and they apologized and rescheduled for the next day.  Then I get a call and apparently they do not do work for HOA's.  They only work for individual homeowners.  Sounds really fishy to me.  I am glad they are not coming. I wasted enough time on them already.< /text>< Pics>

I go here because they have nice burgundy nail colors but I have to say this last time I had my nails done, I got a fall red instead of the burgundy that she showed me. She told me that the colors vary and that maybe next time I would get the color that I was looking for. Don't get me wrong, I liked the color that I got, I just would probably not have picked it not knowing it was that color. It was supposed to be burgundy but this is what I got.< /Review>< name>

I used to love this place until I found out they don't care about our military. I now go to KB nails, they have both CNN and Fox news. They do a way better job. Same price. They listen. And they respect you and speak perfectly their language and English.</Text>

<Review>Made an appointment on Wednesday, for a Friday appointment, the lady who does eyelashes doesn't work past 5pm so I made an appointment during my lunch hour. I get there despite having made an appointment, I waited 15 minutes anyway. The lady did my eyelashes and eyebrows, when I got back to work, one of my lashes was glued to my eyelid. Let me also add there was an altercation between two nail technicians, while they both had clients. Any who I call and speak to the lady she says come back tomorrow ( which was yesterday 2/11/17) and so I did. By the time I woke up Saturday both lashes were gone. I go to Sally's purchase eyelash and this idiot gets hot glue into my eyeball, having the nerves to be rude as if they didn't waste 45 of my minutes the day prior. While this unprofessional lady is suggesting that it's my fault for blinking I'm steady trying to get the damn glue out my eye! An hour later after flushing my eye for several minutes I finally have relief. I suggest sac town nails for eyelashes I've gone to them before. Never ever seek services here.
Fun Fact: my sister went there a few days prior for a full set within 3 days 5 nails completely came off, COMPLETELY< /Review>< pictures>

RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.
They shaved my nails down to my skin on one hand i was livid. I left and I wish they would have tried to charge me. Hopefully will read this before but if not know that I feel your pain. Thankfully Kb Nails across from Loehmann’s Plaza was able to fix the disaster.</Review>

<review>My last nail set need a FILL badly, so I came here as a resort. Customer service wasn't bad. It was okay. But the lady did me justice for a simple FILL. She re shaped them and just did a whole better job than my last nail lady. I'd come back here again if it wasn't so far and expensive. Maybe for prom nails. But my fill cost $30. $35 plus tip.< /review>< user_name>

<rating>1<//rating><review>It started off good until I went in the back to get my lip and chin  waxed. She was doing her job and then said I be right back. She came back in about five minutes and was rushing to complete the job. I feel like she was too busy and was not tentative to me. When I left I had left over wax on my lip and chin.  The price was $5.00 for lip and chin and she charged me $12.00 I didn't say anything other than thinking she was trying to pocket the $2.00 for her tip. I will never visit that place again.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ada4637f696d7:0x97e3e06b4b9fc63d<//Gmap_id></record>

A friend of mines came here once an she really didn't like it. But I decided to try it anyways since it was close to me.so far I've gone here 5 times and have had a pleasant experience each time..the pedis have been amazing and my nails have lasted so long that I'm forced to get fills because they are really stuck..I haven't convinced my friend to try it again since she found a new nail lady, but I love it an will continue to come here. // UPDATE: Ive gone in 2 more times after my review (got different nail techs) and it was the worse I guess it depends who you get to do your nails.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>The guy doing my nails seemed rushed. Cut them too short. Was rough on my cuticles, and didn't even trim them all.  before we started I told him I wanted a bow design. He told me no problem. Then when he put got done with the bow it was so sloppy I had to have him take it off. So I didn't even get what I really wanted. He missed the side of my nails on the thumb so I had to point that out to him. He was not detail oriented. I had to ask him to take the polish off of my fingers before I left because he wasn't even going to clean them up.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. The only good thing was the color selection for gel polish.< /review>< Time>

Went in for pedicure and manicure pedi looks okay, there files and stuff don't look new or very clean.  My manicure was done by a guy and it's only been 2weeks 3 have fallen off like completely that's never happened before, cheap products much. . Not going there again. My set looked nice at 1st and 2weeks later they were flying off my orig sets usually last me all month, going somewhere else next time.</text>

< Review>
Just like everything there is always going to be good and bad.  I haven't been to many shops but this shop is full of hard working ladies. I have worked with three different gals Kim, Lee, and JoJo each having their own ways of doing things but they were all great. my nails always look great and if I am unhappy with the anything they are great about making it better. sometimes just expressing yourself works better than getting upset and venting through a review or making a scene. this is a great place and I would recommend this shop to my friends. Looking forward to my appointment today.</Review>

(Translated by Google) I have a very good experience my nails I have about 3 months that I put them I loved them and I am only going to have them filled and they look great ... nothing more than a fact that the individual does not have much patience ... but still I keep going because in very fast and you don't get bored net

If I could give this place less than one star, I would. If Google reviews had black holes for bad reviews, I would push this place past the event horizon.

Do not shop at this rip-off establishment.

A few days ago my girlfriend and I bought two iPhones there at an OK price. The salesperson sold us cases and screen protectors for the phones. We did not ask the prices for those, but I am willing to pay more than the Amazon price to support a local business. They also sold us one pair of earbuds. We did not know that the regular iPhone earbuds were in the boxes with the phones. The salesperson said the earbuds were regularly $120, but we would get them for $70.

When we got home we found out that we had been charged $119.96 for the cases and covers, that we did not need extra earbuds, that the earbuds we had bought should retail for about $30, and that the most expensive iPhone 11 screen protectors on Amazon are $20 for a two-pack. The packaging for the screen protectors was not in the bag with the iPhone boxes, earbuds and receipts.

When we returned to the store today, the salesperson told us he had done everything correctly, that $29.99 each was the correct price for the screen protectors and cases, and that the earbuds were not returnable, even though the package had not been opened. When I asked to speak to the manager, the salesperson claimed to be the manager and owner of the store. Another Cricket store told us later that they sell an iPhone 11 screen protector for $14.99. I am going to guess that price is for a two-pack.

I got no help from Cricket phone and chat support. They told me to return to the store and ask for the manager. They could not give me the name of the store owner, nor could they verify that the salesperson's name on the purchase receipt matched the name of the owner.

One can accept the $30 price for each case and add another $30 for screen protectors (rather high prices, but legitimate). That comes to $90 that we should have been charged. The total charge for the earbuds we don't want, the cases, and the protectors was $190. This store ripped us off for $100.

Let me repeat. This store overcharged us by $100 and refused to make it right.

Rip-off establishment. Do not shop there!<//Review>

<review>Dr. Schneider and his staff are exactly what we all want at the dentist. Cleanliness, calm, so kind and understanding I felt important and cared for. I’m a 76 year old woman with a fear of the dentist stemming from an assault on my life years ago. I told him about that experience and we both agreed on the best ways to continue with dental procedures in a way that meets both of our needs. His office is sanitary and exudes a welcoming warmth. Parking is a breeze and his pricing is very affordable. I enjoyed meeting with him, and honestly,  I look forward to my upcoming appointment.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1619549723388, 'text': "Hi Jill,\nWe can't thank you enough for your kind words!

I went to another dentist for a routine cleaning and was told I needed a ton of dental work. To make matters worse they wanted me to do it right then and there. I’m so glad I decided to wait because I saw Dr. Schneider for a second opinion and it changed everything! The treatment at the other office was unnecessary and would have been very costly. Dr. Schneider was trustworthy, friendly, knowledgeable, and very realistic. I will only be going to Dr. Schneider from here on out! Everyone in the office is very friendly and welcoming. Plus, it’s the cleanest office I have ever seen! They take Covid precautions seriously! I would give 10 stars if I could. I can’t sing their praises enough!<//Review>

This office was great! I normally feel anxious when I go to the dentist but my experience here was actually pleasant.

Dr. Schneider was awesome, super friendly, professional and patient.
He took the time to explain everything about my issues in great detail.

The office staff was also very friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend this place!</text>

My dental visit was world class. The team at Dr. Schneider’s office are in perfect harmony.  With the new health protocols I felt safe and well taken care of. The doctor’s gentle touch and excellent skill make for a very pleasant experience. I drove up from San Diego because it was well worth the trip.<//Text>

<text>Thorough, informative, and friendly; After my first visit today I can say it's the best dentist visit I've ever had. The office feels homey and comfortable; not once did I get anxious (as I normally do it medical environments, including previous dentists). Everyone there is courteous, and the cleaning and examination was informative and the most thorough I've ever had.

All in all a great visit. No complaints to the point I actually look forward to my next visit. If I could give this more stars, I would :)< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Dr. Schneider and his staff are always upbeat, very professional and kind. I’ve been a patient for 25 years now and have never once had a bad experience. Even having my wisdom teeth taken out was not so bad. One thing I really appreciate is Dr. Schneider is a master at giving shots. Shots are easily my least favorite part of visiting the dentist and with his technique you barely notice. Seriously! Needless to say, cleanings and routine check ups are a breeze. Perhaps less important than the human element, I have noticed that all their equipment tends to be top notch. I’ve had no reason to check out other dental offices, but I’d be willing to bet that when it comes to technology they are years behind Dr. Schneider. He may not be the cheapest game in town, but when it comes to my mouth he’s worth every penny!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>After 20 years of going to Dr. Schneider for my dental needs, I know that office to be professional, kind and careful. They always have state-of-the-art equipment, and this is even more true in the time of COVID. They have more safety/protective equipment and procedures here than probably any other doctor or dentist's office in Orange County. No one cares more for patient safety and comfort!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

The initial visit he impressed me with his listening skills. The more he actively listened the more I shared as I felt he was genuinely interested in getting to know me and my history. I asked him questions about his experience and practices. He asked me good questions about my expectations and before I left we had a long term plan. The staff was equally professional, helpful and personable.
The second was a few days ago and of course deep into the quarantine phase. It was a semi emergency that I doubted he’d see me about as his office is closed for normal appointments. However I was scheduled the next day.  I was a little apprehensive about the safety factors of being in a public building but found his office had incorporated every precaution and safety procedure that could be instilled including hi tech air filters that could screen the most myopic  of all viruses.
I have always had excellent dentists since a young girl ( my grandfather was a dentist). After moving to CA 16 years ago,  even though I tried to screen the Drs. I have had the most unfortunate recommendations and botched procedures, costing  tens of thousands of dollars.  I am looking forward to working with Dr Schneider and feel like I am back in good hands. He is not only professional but very experienced and knowledgeable.</Text>< userid>

Before I went to my first COVID-19 dental cleaning at Dr. Kurt Schneider’s office, I was prepped thoroughly on the phone by Jeannie as to what I would expect upon arrival. There were several safety precautions which were implemented by the staff, from taking my temperature and having me use hand sanitizer, to giving me booties to wear over my shoes. In addition to the always excellent cleaning I received from Jeannie, I felt well taken care of and safe in the office. Thank you!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I’ve been going to Kurt for 2 and a half years now and he and his team are by far the best I’ve ever experienced. I’ve had everything from simple cleaning all the way dental implants and wisdom teeth removal done with Dr. Schneider and it has all been far better than expected. He and his team are generally very punctual and easy going. They explain everything in an easy to understand manner and are always very straight forward regarding treatment, insurance coverage and pricing. I never thought I’d be leaving a positive review for a dentist but over the few years that they have been taking care of me they have provided excellent and transparent service with an amazing and friendly staff, I couldn’t recommend them highly enough.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>Been a patient here for 2 years and I can’t say enough good things. From the front staff to the hygienists to Dr. Schneider himself everyone is beyond AMAZING! I just went in today for a filling for a pretty deep cavity. I was in and out in 30 minutes and didn’t feel an ounce of pain or discomfort. I always have the best experience when I go there. I used to be anxious about the dentist, but not anymore. I look forward to my appointments. Thank you to the staff and Dr. Schneider for giving me back my teeth health.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I have nothing but praise for my experience with Dr. Schneider and his wonderful staff. I have been going to them for years and have referred many people to his office in that time. The staff are top notch. Warm and caring. The Doctor himself is a complete perfectionist and very calm and knowledgeable. He’s a real pro and a top Dentist in the country. All of the equipment is state of the art as well. My oral health has never been better than in the years I’ve spent in Dr. Schneider’s care, so come on and take a chair!< /text>

Dear Dr. Schneider and your Staff,

Thank you so much for all your help you gave me in the time of need.
Everybody made so many extra  steps for me, so the Dr.s could perform my operation.   What a mess, I will never forget this fiasco!

All of you were as gentle as possible, if it would not have been for my back  it would have been a piece of cake.

I will highly recommend you to my family and friends.  Just like somebody recommended you to me many years ago.  I am so sorry,
that I didn't keep it up.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,
Lilly Vollmond< /Text>

Dr. Schneider has been our dentist for many, many years.  I love the whole team, Doctor and his assistant Laurel, my hygienist Audra, and Diane who keeps the front office running efficiently and smoothly, as well as making the best cookies.  There is a wonderful atmosphere of caring from everyone, and whatever problems have arisen, I've always felt confident I'm getting the best dental treatment.  Thanks to each of you for your wonderful, professional involvement and concern.< /Review>

Dr. Schneider is the most patient and gentle dentist I have EVER been to.

One of the best offices I have been to. I'm glad I found it. I have my family going to it also. It's a state-of-the-art office set-up and equipment. If your looking for a top notch Dentist with a professional staff, this is the one. In my opion he is one of the best skilled Dentists in Orange County, Dr Schneider is the man that will fit your Dental needs. From Diane to the rest of the staff, you will get nothing but the Best Service and Care. With Covid-19 going on, Dr Schneider has added new procedures and equipment to make all patient safer. Upon my last visit a couple of days ago, I experienced the new steps in place for my safety and I was impressed. I give this Doctor and his Staff five stars plus. I highly recommend this Doctor to anyone for your Dental needs.<//text>

I visited Dr Schneider office today, and usual I had good and reassuring dental experience as always at the office. The staff is caring, conscientious and professional as always, especially during this time of uncertainty and extra needed health precautions. I so appreciate Dr. Schneider and his Staff for being there and all the hygienic practices they are taking during this time. I highly recommend them.!!< /text>

<review>Dr. Schneider and his staff have been absolutely fantastic. I have been putting off finding an new dentist for nearly two years after moving away from mine and I’m so thankful a friend recommended this office. Diane has been a tremendous help communicating with me and working with my benefits office to ensure complete pricing transparency before I come in. Dr. Schneider is thorough and ensured I was comfortable during every step of my appointments, taking the time to explain all options available and including me in the treatment plan. The office is beautiful and I was amazed by all of the technology they use to ensure the very best care is provided. I watched The Price is Right during my painless filling and was able to grab a cup of tea on the way out the door. They feel a lot like the family practice I left behind.< /review>< pics>

I have never been a fan of going to the dentist but Dr. Schneider and his staff go out of their way to make patients feel comfortable and relaxed.  The office ambience is pleasant and everyone is extremely friendly and sensitive to your needs.

I have also found Dr. Schneider to be extremely thorough and professional.   He has explained all procedures in detail before they happen.  I am incredibly fortunate that he was recommended to me.  I hope I can do the same for someone else.< /Text>

<text>Best cleaning ever and so thorough! I never felt rushed Audra took her time and was so gentle. She was genuinely interested in me as a person and my overall heath. You won’t feel like a number in this office. You’ll feel like someone your dentist office really cares about! This office stands out from the rest. Would highly recommend!< /text></record>

As a new patient, it was a positive experience from entry to exit. I was greeted by Diane, office manager, received dental office tour and introduced to staff. I was pleased meeting Dr. Schneider, he’s competent and experienced in all facets of dentistry. As a senior citizen, I’m pleased with the personalized service by staff that truly care for each patients health & welfare. I’m truly grateful to have been accepted as a new patient. Thank you Diane!
Sincerely,  Lonnie B.

Today 12/11/19 I had my second appointment with Dr. Schneider. First Julie, one of three hygienist, gave me an excellent cleaning. Then had oral examination by Dr. Schneider, followed with summary and plan moving forward.
Folks, this is a five star dental practice with a top shelf dentist. Call Diane for an appointment, it’s truly a refreshing dental experience.
Warm regards,  Lonnie B.

2/12/20. Deep cleaning / Laser treatment with Jeannie, a fantastic hygienist.  No discomfort whatsoever, very knowledgeable with personality plus. Thank you!   Lonnie B.

6/18/20. Today I visited Dr Schneider, DDS, and procedure was flawless in preparation for an implant.
It’s comforting knowing the office and staff are wearing protective clothing, gloves, face shields and entire office is sterile, while each patient is screened upon entry, temperature taken and booties placed over patients shoes. Also, there are new air filtration
systems throughout. These are challenging times as coronavirus has taken a national toll, but Dr. Schneider's efforts to take protective measures for his patients, staff and profession speaks volumes
to his character. My family is very pleased with Dr Schneider and confident you’ll also love this dentist.

Regards,  Lonnie B.

7/29/20.  This appointment consisted of an extraction and bone graph in prep for an implant.
I received a mild sedative that relaxed me and curtailed any anxiety. Experienced no pain and slept thru majority of treatment. Excellent care and comfort provided. Dr. Schneider followed up with a PM phone call to check on my welfare.
I’m grateful to the entire staff for their professionalism and an amazingly talented Dentist.

Sincerely,  Lonnie B

9/15/20.
Dr. Schneider is a five-star general Dentist. I’ve been so pleased with his entire staff's professionalism and encourage anyone needing a dentist to give them a call. As a senior, I’ve been to several dentists in my 74 years. Personally, I honestly believe Dr. Schneider is the most competent, talented and trustworthy dentist one could ever hope for. Don’t delay, call today!

<Review>Dr. Kurt Schneider has been my dentist for more than 20 years. He is an outstanding dentist and oral surgeon. His suite of dental rooms, labs and offices is state of the art. Dr. Schneider and his staff of dentistry professionals are regularly upgrading their knowledge and skills on all the latest techniques and procedures. They are dedicated to making clients feel welcome and at ease.
I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Schneider and his wonderful staff of dentistry professionals for even the most complex dental work and dental surgery. Their care will be the best that you can possibly expect and follow up care and concern is always right on point.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>What a wonderful experience. I moved to the area recently and went to another dentist before coming here. I knew that dentist was not for me. When I came to see Dr. Schneider everything was perfect from the moment I walked through the door. Diane is friendly and helpful with any questions. Elisa thoroughly explained what she was doing and made me feel comfortable. Dr. Schneider was pleasant made sure they did what they needed to do and only what they needed to do for my health. I would recommend anyone to them.< /review><user>115798111289544010607<//user>< Name>

"Dr Schneider and his team are a true class act. One of the best dental offices in Orange County. They are very knowledgeable, educated in the latest techniques and have top of the line equipment. Even more exciting, they are contracted with my insurance plan. They treated me like a million bucks and my dental work is superb and amazing.

<text>I  recently  made my semi-;annual visit to the office of Kurt Schneider, DDS. I am 91 years of age and want my teeth to last as long as I do  I entered his waiting room and was immediately greeted by one of his friendly employees. I took advantage of my early arrival by planting myself in  his electric massage reclining chair.  However, I was soon to find my next  pleasant  experience by being informed that my x-rays showed NO cavities and I proceeded with the hygienist  to clean my teeth.  Her expertise, I believe is greatly responsible for the healthy condition of my teeth.  I would not hesitate referring anyone to visit
Dr. Schneider and his staff. Come early to enjoy the recliner, as well.</text><username>Anne Macha< /username><userid>104366029629155615357< /userid><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I moved to the West Coast a few years back and have been looking for a good dentist ever since.  I can finally say I found one!   I felt like the previous office I was visiting was not being honest with me as far as the invasive treatment they kept insisting I needed, so I decided to get a second opinion.  I came across Dr. Schneider's practice on the web and based on the great reviews I decided to give them a try.  I have to say the reviews DO NOT LIE!  Dr. Schneider and his staff are just fabulous.  Everything from the friendliness and professionalism of the staff to the cleanliness of the office environment is inviting and comforting.  During my initial visit, Dr. Schneider took his time and got to know me and find out what my dental concerns were, as well as what my expectations were from a dental practice!  I was able to voice all my concerns without being rushed and he and the hygienist made me feel very much at ease while we went over every tooth....all while being cozy under a blanket! :)
Overall I was very satisfied with every aspect of my visits and felt comfortable with the staff.  And I'm glad I made the switch because as it turns out, I didn't need 80% of the invasive treatments the previous office was trying to sell me.  If you're looking for an experienced, professional, friendly and most importantly HONEST dental practice...I highly recommend Dr. Schneider!< /Text>

<username>Joyce Lingren</username><date>1467861668714<//date><rating>5< /rating><text>I needed an old filling in a lower, back molar replaced due to cracking. Today, the filling was removed and the tooth was prepared with a build up for a temporary. I am awaiting a permanent crown. I have had this done at a previous dentist that was not a positive experience and resulted in a root canal. To say that I feared this process again is to put it mildly. Dr. Schneider and his staff do EVERYTHING you make you the most comfortable and at ease. He is amazingly gentle and easy to communicate with. His temporaries are so well fitting they could be the permanent crowns. He is very much a perfectionist and knows his craft well. His assistant, Laurel is friendly, professional and makes you feel like you are the best patient..so positive. You are greeted by Diana each time and engaged in conversation that puts you immediately at ease. The entire staff is top notch. To end the positive experience, there are always fresh baked cookies and cold beverages for the taking. I am finding my experiences at this office to be my best dental experiences in a very long time.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Awesome!  Very safe office!  Elisa is a very good hygienist!  She looked very hard to find any problems, but only found areas to watch in the future.  So for this cleaning appointment, it was very good for me; no things to correct or fix.  I highly recommend Dr. Schneider and his staff.</Review>

I have not been to the dentist in over 4 years and Dr. Schneider's staff did excellent at calming my nerves.The receptionist was very helpful with scheduling my husband and my appointments and she took the extra care and time to make sure our insurance nuances were handled. It may seem like a small detail, but it just set the tone for the visit knowing she was handling it all. Elisa was my hygienist and she was so kind, patient, gentle, and knowledgeable. She made me feel comfortable and calm and the visit never felt rushed. The office was impeccable and honestly, it was just the best first visit I have ever had. The staff truly seems to put the patient first and they all work hard together to make it a pleasant experience... which is huge since nothing about the dentist is pleasant to me! Dr. Schneider clearly understands people and has a high regard for his staff, as they are all just the friendliest and most knowledgeable people I have encountered in an office.
Update on follow up visits: Still could not be happier with my experience thus far. I have all sorts of problems with my teeth and gums and I really appreciate Dr. Schneiders approach to my care... which is basically not overwhelming with me with the laundry list of things I need to do, and instead tackling one problem at a time. He continuously takes his time explaining each treatment option, the need for it, the benefit of it, and the importance of it. The dentist is not my favorite place, but at least here I don't feel like I am being taken advantage of or pushed into something I am not ready to commit to.</text>

Having moved to California from the East Coast I had to rely on others to recommend a dentist as well as doctors in this this area.   Dr.Kurt Schneider was VERY highly recommended by my son who lives in Mission Viejo and so I went to him and I can't praise the doctor enough. In fact I have recommended him to others and they in turn think so highly of him. His staff is wonderful and knowledgeable at what they do.
Thanks Dr. Schneider!.

My wife and I have been going to Dr. Schneider's office for more than 5 years. We were referred by a neighbor and we have both referred other friends to the office. The staff is polite, friendly, and attentive. We have cleanings at the office on a regular basis and we are always pleased with the professional job that we receive. We have had various procedures performed by Dr. Schneider, some simple and some miraculous in my opinion. He saved a tooth that I did not expect to be saved. This is the cleanest Dr.'s office I have ever seen. Great job to everyone there.<//review>

I have become used to the exceptional timeliness and professionalism of the Dr. Schneider office and team, and my most recent visit was no exception.  Some years ago I had some implants done by Dr Schneider they have been flawless without causing any complaint.  Last week something internal to the implant broke causing the tooth to loosen.  Immediately an appointment was made, the doctor assessed the problem, replacement parts were ordered, and within a very short order all repairs were made and I was on my merry way.
But here's the grab,  it was all done for FREE; the two appointments, parts, labor, the works. Dr. Schneider stands behind his work, even when the problem is not his fault.
My sincere thanks to Dr Schneider and every one of his remarkable dental team.

Actually, this was the most thorough comprehensive review that I have ever experienced.  My husband also sees Dr. Schneider and I sat in on his first visit with him.  Dr. Schneider gave him a very comprehensive exam and made his suggestions.  What I appreciate about Dr. Schneider is that he makes his suggestions and leaves it up to the patient to decide which course they would like to take.  No pressure.  Also, they have a very lovely office and the staff are all very friendly and personable.  His assistant Diane is very helpful in going over your insurance coverage and the cost of procedures so there will be no surprises.  They are all eager to answer any questions you might have.  I would highly recommend Dr. Schneider to anyone who is looking for a very good dentist.< /Text>< rating>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Dr. Kurt Schneider sets the bar when it comes to dentistry. He and his team practice an exceptional level of personable and professional service with top-rate care. His office is equipped with state-of-the-art technology; he, himself, is knowledgeable, honest and professional. Over the past 20 years, I have referred many friends and family to Dr. Schneider, all of which have emerged very happy new patients. For all of the reasons above, it is with great gratitude that I write this review.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Everything about Dr. Schneider and his staff is top notch. From the moment you walk in you are warmly greeted and treated like family. They show you around the facility and make sure that you are comfortable and that all of your questions are answered to your satisfaction.

Dr. Schneider is warm, caring and very gentle. No pain at all!

I really can't recommend Dr. Schneider's office enough. You will be well taken care of.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I have been a client for over 15 years for almost every procedure from Dental cleaning to tooth implants and everything in between.  The reason I keep coming back is that Dr Kurt Schneider stays ahead of the curve as far as new procedures are concerned.  Example............remember when they were ready to give you the Novocaine  and they pulled out that needle the size of a Monkey wrench that should only be used on elephants?        What a pleasant surprise to see that replace with a small piece of plastic hose attached to a very small needle that when use by Dr. Schneider made it a pleasant experience.
I do have to compliment the rest of the office with Diane the office manager keeping me posted on my insurance and Alisa who does my cleaning and makes sure I brush every night...........jj<//review>

<text>Dr. Kurt and his team are hands down, no contest the BEST of the BEST! I never knew that going to the Dentist's office could be such a great and informative experience. Dr. Kurt and his team are the most thorough and caring professionals I have ever met! My experience is like going to visit family every time I have gone! I have been to a lot of dentists office's and have never seen such quality! Their technology is top of the line! Dr. Kurt and his team have the best "bed side" manner I have ever experienced. I would fly from the east coast to continue to be under the care of such an amazing team! If you have been considering a change in dental care, or even if you haven't... Going to Dr. Kurt will be the best decision you have ever made for your smile! He has even helped me with my migraines! Go see them! You will be ecstatic with the results! Thank you Dr. Kurt, Laurel Bennett, RDA, and Audra Gomez, RDH! It has truly been a pleasure to be under your care!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Due to a traumatic dental experience, I'm in the market for a new dentist, so I scheduled a consultation with Dr. Schneider and was extremely impressed, beginning to end. From my initial phone call to my individual consultation with Dr. Schneider, I experienced a level of empathy and caring that was helpful and therapeutic. In addition to a sympathetic office staff, Dr. Schneider treated me with a great deal of respect and understanding. He listened to my story, examined my teeth, and took me into his private consultation room to discuss my options. He understood my concerns and presented me with a very unique solution. I could tell he is very knowledgeable and looks out for his patients' best interests. I know that if I choose Dr. Schneider's office and dental expertise, I am positive I will receive the greatest overall care possible. Thank you Dr. Schneider and company!</review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
As a new transplant to California, it was important to find a good dentist that we would want to keep over time. I have now been going to Dr. Schneider's office for a couple years and have been very satisfied with the doctor, front office staff and also the hygienist. They are friendly yet professional, taking care to listen to their patients. The office is clean and the latest technology is used to ensure the best of care is offered. I would definitely recommend Dr. Schneider and his staff to anyone looking for a quality dental experience.< /Review>

< Review>
I'm one of those people who hate pain and never happy about going to the dentist. I needed two crowns and didn't want to experience the needle, drilling, etc., process. Dr. Schneider suggested a way I could sleep through the whole procedure. It worked great, I had no pain and remembered none of it. He was very understanding and considerate of all my concerns. It's so nice to have a dentist who takes the time to talk to you and explain what's needed and what will be done. I've worked in the dental field in the past and am very pleased with the results as well. The whole office is very kind and responsive to any questions or concerns. Thank you for the easy and painless experience. Anita</Review>

From the moment I booked my appointment to the time I was leaving the office for home I had a wonderful experience.  Who can say that when going for a dental visit?  To make my experience even better is knowing that I will have no fear with any of the dental work Dr. Schneider does.</text>

Today was my first visit to Dr. Schneider's office.  I was pleasantly surprised by how kind and professional  everyone was. I am normally terrified of the dentist but they offered several different options to help me if things ever get challenging.  Let's hope they don't but I like to be prepared.  Thanks Dr. Schneider.  Will be back for a cleaning  soon.</review>

I have been going to Dr. Schneider for a few years now and I would not go anywhere else.  They are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  I love my hygienist Elisa!  Elisa and Dr. Schneider are extremely thorough and detailed in recommending anything I need to keep my teeth healthy and my cleanings are always great. I live in the City of Orange and the drive to Mission Viejo once every 6 months to the dentist is well worth it.<//Review>

I’m new to the area, and after a subpar experience with a different local dentist, I am SO happy that I found Dr. Schneider! Both he and his staff are excellent, and his office is very impressive, state-of-the-art, and clean. Dr. Schneider really took the time to make me feel comfortable and thoroughly examine my teeth. During my visit I didn’t feel rushed or passed over. He was very precise and good at communicating what he observed during my oral evaluation (spots we’d need to keep an eye on, etc.) and I felt like I could really trust him. He did not try to upsell me on any procedures or other things I might need done (like my last dentist had). Best of all, Dr. Schneider was very friendly and welcoming, which was so nice since I get a little nervous when I’m visiting the dentist. If I could rate him higher than 5 stars, I would. A+ dentist. Looking forward to my next cleaning in 6 months.</review>

I first heard of doctor Schneider 22 years ago when I was pregnant with my first from an emergency room nurse at Mission Hospital. My father flew in from NY and had prior dental work before he arrived, causing an abscess. It was forth of July weekend 1996, and Dr. Schneider opened up the office to help a man he’s never met for a family he never knew. We have been his patients ever since. My Husband’s Family all see Dr. Schneider, our friends, and my children (who are now adults) do too. He stays current on all the medical trends, devices, and techniques which makes each visit more comfortable and efficient. I used to be a scaredy-cat, but now love going to the dentist!
I can say his office staff is the best around. They are always cheerful and manage to help you out what ever your needs are. The hygienists are amazing, and have been with Dr. Schneider longer than we have! It says a lot when your office doesn’t have much turnover.
I have and will continue to tell everyone about Dr. Schneider because he is a rare gem and does the best work in town.
Went today and the office was so set up for your protection. Hepa filiters, new auction machines, and booties for your feet. I couldn’t have been better protected or safer in my own home.<//text>

(He's definitely the BEST)  We went over all of this 2 weeks ago in an appointment, but I needed reassurance and further explanation and felt I needed to see Dr. Schneider one more time before the procedure. I first met with Diane who went over everything patiently, carefully and pleasantly, then Dr. S. took time out of his busy schedule to once again discuss the procedure with me.  He was extremely patient and answered many questions that I had asked before.  I now feel comfortable and confident about having this procedure done.  He truly listens to what might seem like silly fears and anxieties, and puts you at ease,  There is no one else to go to, I drive 2 hours to see him and its well worth it.<//Text>< userid>

< Review>
Per usual, the receptionist had my paperwork ready before I arrived for my appt.  In this case, it was the yearly personal information and privacy practice forms that need to be signed.  Once completed, I went right back with the dental hygienist for my biannual cleaning.  She asked some very specific questions about my dental health and compared my overall exam with the previous exam to track my performance so to speak.  I was finished in about 45 mins.  In addition to the expert dental care at this office, they are very professional in their approach to each visit as well as the patient experience overall.  Very thorough.</Review>

I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Schneider for a second opinion and I'm glad I did, he was much more thorough in his investigation into my aching tooth than my normal dentist, his staff is friendly and welcoming, his office is very clean and has the latest equipment, I'm very glad I found Dr. Schneider and I'm looking forward to working with him in the future.<//review>

I can't say enough about my positive experiences with Dr. Schneider and his staff. The best thing I could say about my last visit, was after a extraction of an infected root canal, splitting it from a fused crown. And a bone graft, I felt just as good after the appointment as I did coming into the appointment. Dr. Schneider and his assistant could not have been more concerned about my comfort during the procedure. Thank you Dr. Schneider and staff for taking such great care of me, as you always have in the past. I could not imagine going to any other office for anything, even for just a typical tooth cleaning. One last note, maybe its just me but each time I have undergone a surgical procedure, pain killers are prescribed, but I never need them. Guess I'll keep them for real pain.</Text>

The entire staff here is very professional. While going through my inspection they asked my preference for details, wether I cared to hear the specifics or just a big picture kind of deal. They contacted me several times informing me of new openings that I could have moved my next appointment to, which I really appreciated, and while you are there for whatever procedure they make sure that you are as comfortable as possible. I will be going back in the future for whatever work I need done.<//Text>

Dr Kurt Schneider and all his staff are top notch, the "creme de le creme", in the dental service world.  The office itself is first class in design, furniture and equipment.  The friendly environment, however, is what distinguishes itself far above the rest.

This is truly a wonderful dentist office. No one LOVES going to the dentist but the staff and Dr. Schneider takes all of the anxiousness out of the process and you feel assured you are in great hands.< /Review>

<Text>If you are looking for a TLC Dentist in Mission Viejo, the you need to make an appointment with Dr. Kurt Schneider.  His office is on the corner of La Paz and Margaurite across from the City Library.  I can recommend him highly as he will be placing a crown in this month.
The Front office Administrator is excellent and goes over every item on your account to ensure that you understand the procedure and the cost.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

Dr. Schneider is 1st class. I have always had a fear of Dentist my whole life, and I must say that I don't have that fear anymore. I truly have a MILLION DOLLAR SMILE now:) Thanks Dr. Kurt!<//text>

<Text>"Loved it" is a metaphor that does not apply to oral surgery.  I have significant dental issues arising from age and stupidity.  Bone transplants, crowns, implants, root canals, and just plain ugly is part of my metaphor.  Dr. Schneider just keeps on sorting through the issues with aplomb and skill.  Very few will have such significant issues but if Kurt can handle my issues, e.g., close to 16 teeth replaced, then he can handle yours.  I will look like Brad Pitt when it is all done - well, maybe Barney Fife (Don Knotts on Mayberry RFD).</Text></record></dataset><record>

For many, many years, fear was instilled when it came to fathoming dental procedures. I never wanted to go, and i hardly ever went!  That was probably a bad decision.
Fortunately, my 1st cavity came when I was 21... so, I got that fixed, but was then told ALL 4 of my wisdom teeth needed to be pulled out as well!! OMG? WHAAT??
My 1st super wise tooth was the WORST ever... !! The DDS told me NOT to look just prior to administering the anesthesia, and of course - what did i do?! - I looked!! That caused me to hyperventilate and freak out AND even cry!! (and i'm NO cry baby)... that set my underlying-instilled "fears" in stone haha

After that experience, the field of dentistry was on a demise for me!! I avoided the dentist for 10 years!!! Sadly, it was 10 years too long...

I must say, I did not anticipate the kindness and gentleness of this practice I only recently discovered. I had a free consult with x-rays on my 1st visit, then we discussed a treatment plan. There was NO pressure, and the staff is AMAZING!!! Those ladies make you feel exceptionally comfortable.

Finally, most importantly! The reason I freaked out when I was young was because the DDS was NOT very gentle!  & honestly, I just felt very uncomfortable!
Dr Schneider is quite gentle. I didn't even realize he was numbing me up when he did!  He gave me NO real warning and just kept me calm. That is VITAL!!
Being a medical professional, this type of bedside manner is the most reputable. I am happy to say I have a dentist! (whereas before i really felt like i didn't need one haha)... I NEED 1!

I am so content with this facility that you can bet your sweet bottom teeth that I'll be biting my way back in there very soon (mostly because they SAY i should hahaha)

For excellent quality care, go see Kurt & his amazing staff!
I  promise you wont be disappointed. <3 :)< /Text>

I had Invisalign and had a cavity. They asked where I had gotten Invisalign and tried to sell me on their treatment. I opted to get the cavity fixed in a follow-up after my treatment was complete. I was then told by Dr Shepard that I had waited too long to fix my cavity and needed a root canal. The person they referred me to was surprised and after looking concluded that I didn’t need a root canal at all. Just a simple filling. Waste of time and money.<//text>< Pics>

I felt very informed because Dr. Shepherd and the dental hygienist who performed my cleaning put a strong emphasis on explaining things to me about my dental health, listened to my health history, took time to answer questions, and even asked me to let them know if my cleaning created any discomfort. I guess I'm not used to being so "involved."  The bedside manner of all of the staff was great.</review>

<review>I understand the Dentist isn’t a fun place for most, but every time I go here, it’s a pleasant, easy and informative experience. Their hygienists are professional, compassionate and incredibly smart. Yesterday, Inna took the time to educate me on what she was looking at in my X-rays, showed me the year of year change in one area, elaborated on the value of flossing (no lecture!) and how it could have prevented the cavity. I was so engaged, didn’t feel rushed and learned so much. Right there in the chair I complimented and thanked her for taking the time and interest in my future oral health. Definitely deserves to be recognized and worth sharing! Dr Buhva is great too, thankfully I have minimal experience with her, but know I’m in good hands when I go back for my filling!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Ordered the Green Goddess Salad with chicken for a small gathering of friends and it was a hit!  The salad was fresh and PRETTY, yes pretty.  The salad is topped with fresh edible flowers. Bites and Bashes is now open for inside dining and a welcome place for healthy menu choices in Lomita.<//text>< Pictures>

<Date>1562704174155<//Date><rate>5< /rate><review>Bites and Bashes was such a pleasure to work with. We fell in love with Crystal and Julie at our first tasting, and even more so loved the food they had prepared. Not only was the food incredible, it was also beautifully displayed. The flavors were complex and interesting, and presented on beautiful service ware and topped with edible flowers which made a breathtaking spread of food. Our guests were blown away by how good the food was, crowd favorites were the vegan gluten free Vietnamese glass noodles, which came in a small Chinese food to-go box, the pulled pork sliders with slaw, candied bacon, and the truffle mac and cheese. And the wait staff were all professional and so nice! We also hired our bartenders through Bites and Bashes and they were excellent. Overall, they ensured our experience was easy, enjoyable, and the final result was perfect. And they’re prices were so much better than all the other caterers we researched. I would recommend Bites and Bashes for any event in a heartbeat!<//review>< Pictures>

<Time>1613888562110< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>I was doing some home hunting in the area and looked for a good bite to eat and came across the gorgeous photos for Bites & Bashes. Oddly, what caught my eye out of all the items was the Korean Breakfast plate - a mixture of white rice, bulgogi, and eggs. It seemed so simple yet the pictures looked so gorgeous and I had to try and see if the taste matched the picture quality, and it did!

My Korean Breakfast plate variation was with egg whites (+$1 extra), white rice, and bulgogi. I loved the presentation full of small colorful flakes, making the egg whites (which I know are usually boring - I cook them every morning, so I would know!) into a really nice treat. What should otherwise be a simplistic plate turned out to be really nice and flavorful. The egg whites were fluffy. The white rice was cooked just right (not too soft or hard), and the bulgogi was super flavorful and juicy mixed with onions and giving flavor to the rest of the rice and egg whites. My only small observation was that it was a bit pricy compared to other locations with similar bowls although the flavor profile and attention to detail make sense. I'd love to see some hot sauce or gochujang included though to give it a bit more of a bold flavor profile.

Parking is a little tight. There is some parking in the back of the restaurant as well as street / neighborhood parking (note the neighborhood is a bit narrow street-wise).

The cashier was super nice, and it looked like they were doing a major photo shoot inside. There is also some outdoor seating.

Hope to come back in the near future to try some other dishes!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Been here a few times with my gals for lunch. The crack fries are my favorite along with the candied bacon. Both have a nice spice to it. My friend got the Mac n cheese and it was definitely not your ordinary Mac n cheese it was so much better. The alfredo with chicken is delicious, with the edible flowers. This is definitely a step up from your average cafe. They changed theirnhkurs so make sure you get here before they close.
Another thing we really loved was the owner came out and greeted us, chatted with us gave us a little history on her and how bites n bashes came to be. Such a nice lady.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Great secret gem in the middle of Lomita. Nestled on the corner and easily seen from the street.
Street parking
Family friendly and great spot for brunch finally! Good size menu that includes churro style pancakes, shashuka, sandwiches and burritos.
Picture is if a deconstructed bibimbap could have used some more spice but very good overall.

For the area to have something this good is fantastic. I hope this is the first of many quality spots to follow.</Review>

This unbelievably hip and cute cafe is located in Lomita and I hope it’s here to stay! I loved all the food and drink explanations + the excitement behind all the dishes. The mother was the chef and she came out to make sure we were okay and enjoying the food. She was very proud to say that she raised her children on the food she had just made us. Delicious food from mama, I loved it. Everything had a comforting, yet complex flavor to each dish without anything overpowering each other.

In addition, I loved the vegan aspect of the drinks because they don’t use egg whites, they use aquafaba which is apparently a pea. It was fun learning about this new frothy trick from the owner! It’s definitely safe to bring your vegan pals here.

The crack fries were aptly named as they were definitely made with crack. ;)

They also add colorful flowers to drinks and dishes which I am always a huge fan of. I love color blasts in my food and there’s many to delight your eyes here! Thanks for the wonderful experience!

P A R K I N G:

It’s pretty crowded in the residential area so you may have to foot it. I suggest carpooling.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKJBpC1ptlNpch_35Gwr46O5zKmx4AGnwHK2LA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Caffiene withdrawals for 2 days sucked - especially since I was visiting from out of state! I stumbled into this nice little cafe and the sweet ladies took care of my coffee needs immediately even though I must have looked a terrible fright! They were very kind and the price of the great quality coffee was great! Thank you again for being so helpful!!< /Text>

Cute little place. Beautiful open cafe to work - lots of natural light.

The lavender coffee is on point - rich, strong, and overall wonderful. I also had a turkey sandwich which was delicious. They really packed on the meat (I appreciate it!). They added some korean style pickled vegetables on the side which was a nice and complimentary touch.

The chef stopped by to check in on me which was kind of her. Made you feel welcome. I didn't get a chance to try the baked goods but they looked good! Very bite sized.

My only =( is that a sandwich and a coffee cost me $21 including tip. It's a bit steep for a meal!<//review>

So last Friday I went and checked this place out!

Menu selection is great. So many choices, but I went for the sandwiches.

Cracked fries... /drool
Don't ever not order these!

Atmosphere was great. Gave a vibe of a little coffee shop off the beaten trail.</Review>

<Review>Bites & Bashes was the perfect caterer for our wedding at Los Verdes Golf Course! We could not have been happier with them.

Crystal and everyone we worked with over at Bites & Bashes were organized, responsive, friendly, and helpful. They truly go above and beyond to make sure you're happy.

Their food is delicious, and they give great advice about the best options to go with and how to display it, etc. We received so many compliments about the beautiful charcuterie display, their gorgeous serving dishes, and how great the food was.

I would recommend them 10 times out of 10. Thank you, Bites & Bashes! Can't wait to see you at the cafe soon (they have a delicious cafe you should visit also)!< /Review>< rate>

Highly recommend the candied bacon and crack fries. The drinks are made in house, the lavender lemonade is amazing and the water is filtered and infused with lemon. We've had an entree and a sandwich so far, and we can't wait to try more items on the menu. The peanut butter cookie was so good, I had no words.
Check this place out!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Found my local hot spot! So happy to have this place in walking distance from my house. Bright, clean, modern interior. The owners and staff are friendly, fun, and knowledgeable. The food and drinks look as great as they taste. I highly recommend the bacon candy and "crack fries" as starters. I had the chopped salad on my first visit and the falafel sandwich on my second visit. Both were excellent. I'm looking forward to to coming back  to try their coffee and pastries.</Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

<Review>Enjoyable neighborhood breakfast, brunch and lunch restaurant. Menu is varied with unique dishes. Breakfast specialties along with signature "crack fries". Vegetarian and dishes with lots of bacon offered. Falafel sandwich is a favorite. Lavender lemonade really delish. Catering is offered. No dinner service offered. Just explore this venue. It is really a good neighborhood spot.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><username>Linda Jean Laird<//username>< Time>

Can I give them 10 stars please? B/c 5 is not enough. I needed a large boxed lunch delivered to a corporate event at a weird-ish location, and Bites and Bashes knocked it out of the park!! They were on time, professional, accurate and hasty with the setup. My order was changing up until the day before and Jennifer and Crystal took it in stride, and helped me overcome all the little changes that came up. I ordered the turkey, falafel, roast beef and chicken salad and they were all fantastic. The herbal chicken salad was SO SO SOOO GOOD. This was an epic success and I look forward to doing business with you again soon. Seriously, thank you Jennifer.< /Text>

It's a nice, open room with plenty of tables and may even work for larger groups.
I knew before we arrived I'd be trying the Mama's Bolognese spaghetti and the Crack fries, she got the Asian Chicken Salad as there are few healthy choices for someone watching carbs.
So the first thing I tasted was the Crack fries and they didn't disappoint. She tried one which was her first mistake. They held true to their name and she struggled to keep her hands off.
Then there was the Bolognese spaghetti, real comfort food made with love. I already knew this was going to be one of my favorite places when suddenly she threw us a curve. She came out of the kitchen with a sample plate she wanted me to try. It was a churro pancake with whip cream and Jack Daniels syrup. Oh My God!!!
Anyway she didn't do well on her low carb diet today and I found a new favorite place to have lunch. She said the salad was refreshing and light. She would do it again.
The staff is super friendly and you won't go a minute without seeing them by your table.
We spent $14.50 for the salad, $16.00 for the spaghetti, $5.00 for the fries and $3.00 each for the tropical ice tea (also really good).
So $45.44 before tip so a little high for lunch but well worth it. I'm just gonna start telling people to try this because I'm impressed.< /Text>

<review>This place has definitely gotten worse.. the pizza is not fresh if anything it looks and tastes like day old, stale pizza. It's cold, flat, hard, and oddly shaped. Just really bad. And it's NOT the 1st time this has happened to us. I've even tried calling ahead to place the order but I still get this.. Not sure what going on but they've lost my business.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJATAlHwMsLe61IZe5qgfSjVimM5a-XezvY2fI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1nXGSylkPHm52NGkv6I_DoLrh9XuhbZFnoCaZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7fxjPYUh9XfZgaGn6GoOcVlJN32aSYr7yo09_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

I understand that this place gets really busy (my empathy is the only reason for the 2 stars), but the point of ordering ahead is so that your food is prepared ahead of time and ready when you get there. That has not been the case for the past 6-7 times we have ordered. This last time though, when my husband asked how they didn't have our very simple cheese pizza ready his reply was...wait for it..."I don't know what to tell you." Not only is their ordering system trash, but their inability to acknowledge a severe lacking on THIER part is unacceptable. Sad thing is I love Little Caesars, however not enough to deal with this repeated inconvenience. Sorry, no more business from us! Oh, and this is a picture of what we ended up getting after all was said and done! Looked like something from Chernobyl that even the ninja turtles wouldn't touch with a 10 ft pole.</text>

I placed an order for pick up, I went to the warmer, put in my code and grabbed my pizza and headed home ( my mistake I should have looked first) it was burnt, hard and cold! I went back into the store and as I walked in a customer was screaming at 2 of the employees at the top of his lungs. He stormed out, ( idk what the issue was ) I just stepped up, opened the box, he grabbed it, I heard him say “ Who’s burning the pizza?” To which all they replied was “ It’s not my fault the pizzas are old”. Idk that means,  but it doesn’t sound appetizing or the correct answer. So he comes back around with a new pizza, shows it to me, and that was that. No apology,
or a sorry for the inconvenience, nada. I’ll chalk that up to having just been screamed at I suppose. But who ever had the audacity to knowingly put an old burnt pizza in that box, needs to be fired.< /Text>

<review>I had an awesome experience at this place. We enjoyed the excellent vibes and the menu. The waiters were super attentive. I am glad we finally decided to try this restaurant.<//review><response>None< /response>< user>

<Review>Yea it's true about the hit and miss. And for the most part it's more of a miss majority of the time. My brothers and I (5 of us total) come here on our own/different occasions and it's always an issue. Rather drive alittle further to another location that gives out a little bit more of a quality and service.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
I've given this location 3 chances to show that they provide good food and service.  Only once was it ok at least.  Twice one of my pizzas was burnt and the other it was under cooked.  Not sure how that's possible....I will drive further to another location from this point forward.<//Review>

<Text>Worst pizza ever!!!! And it's not the first time. I have a stray dog that won't even touch it. I used to be general manager at Domino's Pizza and frankly the way the dough is could make people sick. The dough is not proofed correctly it came out so thin the  was actually greasy and doughy.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>1<//Rate>< pics>

<Text>I called 10mins in advance for a fresh pizza. Told to go through the drive thru and it would be ready. I waited almost 15mins in line and another 5min at the window before finally given my pizza. When I did receive it, it was cold, old, stale and not cut right. Because I had to be at work I was unable to wait for another pizza. I have been a customer of LC since I was a child so it saddens me to see they have allowed the quality of food to fall apart.  I work graveyard and expect the same good quality of food that is served during the day. I will never recommend this place to anyone else. I should not have had to wait for something so terrible. I would have given it zero stars if that was an option.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I wait for 30 minutes for a pizza and cheese bread,  when they give me the pizza , the pizza was cold and  the  cheese bread old like hours a go so I wait for another 10 minutes for re-make everything fresh, at the end I dont think it  was worthy. I wait almost 1 hour .
the pizza was with barely cheese on it and the ""cheese bread""" it was with barely cheese on it , very disappoint about this store same thing every time I go there so sad .< /review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>They are hit and miss on the quality of their pizza. Have had good and bad. Last time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza 3/4 of the pizza had little to absolutely NO cheese in the crust.

I sent my friends to this place with my highest recommendations. I visit this restaurant often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The dishes they serve are tasty and the stuff is very friendly and cooperative. Every time  we visit this place we have a lovely time.  I warmly recommend this restaurant.</Text>

Every single time I come, the same over and over again. Wrong order! If the consumer is allergic to something... make sure it doesn’t have it.
worst management and staff.

<text>Delivery order received was incomplete. When I call Little Caesar’s for resolution they wanted ME to resolve their mistake for them by telling me to contact the third party delivery company THEY use. They also offer for me to go pick up the missing items. They also don’t do partial refunds so a refund request was denied. Huge lack of appropriate customer service and willingness to resolve THEIR mistakes. IF YOU DONT WANT TO EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE I SUGGEST GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This company has a lot of growing to do! I’m escalating this to corporate but I really don’t expect much of a resolution. When their is a culture of taking care of customers you feel it within your fist contact.< /text><user_name>Manny Heredia</user_name><time>1588539146977</time><rating>1</rating>< Pics>

I'll admit the first time we came here was bad I think maybe because it had just opened. I went today though and it was a nice experience. The food was great and so was the fast service!< /Review>

All Little Ceasars are not the same. But this one is great, the pizzas are tasty and great the customer service is better. They have top technology to make your pick up fast an easy. You order on line get your code and when you get there they have a serving case displaced with pizza your punch your code and wherever your order is it opens that slot .love it. No waiting.....< /text>

The wait is long sometimes, not always organized. The food is my one and only pizza place who has stayed true to its roots. Love the 6 dollar can still enjoy a $5 pizza. The deep deep dish is the best! Bread sticks are delicious and soft. Wings are good. Never really have a problem with customer service. Should definitely get $5 lunch deal!<//review>

Guess that’s  why it’s $5 pizza I called and they just  asked us to just bring in the box for a free one (we love an hour away) my son was disgusted we fed it up to our dog. Going to dominoes instead . (The pic I posted was deleted it looked disgusting the cheese was melted on the top of the box)</text>

<Review>Ordered Pizza online for pick up in drive-thru. You can't even order cheese for the lunch combo. When we went to go pick up the pizza we waited over 25 minutes in the drive-thru line. When we got to the speaker to tell them we had a pick up they said ok pull up. When we finally got to the window she asked again what the name on the order was. She did not even get the food ready ahead of time. Took her a couple minutes and she came back and told us that the food is not ready yet. That it should be ready after you pull through the line again. I am not waiting over half an hour in the line again. Especially since I was on a time schedule. She went back to check again and came and said. They are boxing it right now. We waited for another 5 minutes and she came back and said. Its not ready yet. Pull by the tree and we will take your food out to you. We pulled by the tree and waited another 15 to 20 minutes past our pickup time. We finally walked in to the shop to ask why we have not recieved our pizza. As we were talking to the manager. You see them whisper in the background to take out the pizza because the people were complaining. The manager did not seem to care and after all that, the only thing she did was gave us a free $5 pepperoni pizza next time we came in. And we got our food and it was barely warm because it has been sitting for so long. When we opened the food at home, they shut the box in the middle of the pizza, so there was a line in the pizza. This is the only Little Cesars in Perris but I will never come back. Will have to go to another city just for pizza</Review></record>

<Text>This place is terrible. We've gone there a few times and we never order anything difficult, always cheese or pepperoni hot and ready pizza. We always go between 4-8pm and if they have pizzas, which most of the time they don't, they aren't hot and taste like they were made hours ago. The place is always busy so I understand running out of stuff. Sometimes. Not every time. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Unfortunately it's the closest Little Caesars and I have kids so I will either be disappointed again or drive twice as far to go to the next closest location< /Text>< pics>

The pizza here is pretty good I like it better than the other franchise pizza places in Perris. 1 time I ordered chicken wings and it came out cold. I went there earlier today and it was difficult getting out of parking because people were lining up in the drive thru< /Review>

The pizza was cold and it wasn't what I ordered. The bestest, mostest has become the worstest!!!!! This location is unorganized, chaotic and needs to get a competent person in charge. The only consistent thing I get from this store are mistakes. So sad.

I love your pizza but not from this location.<//Text>

<text>This little ceasers sucks. Wait times are ridiculous even when called in and showing up 5 min after expected maximum. Food was cold when received. Worker offered free crazy bread for extended wait and then didn't give. Multiple visits by the family have all had poor service. Too bad because the prices are good<//text>< user_name>

This is my favorite pizza place when I dont want to spend alot. But not today.. 12/18/2019 7:00 PM
I ordered online two pizzas and they were supposed to be ready by 6:30 PM one of my pizzas was just sitting there for 20 minutes on the table and when I got up and asked for my order she had no idea where my order was. She found one pizza on the table, I asked for the other pizza, when got back on the kitchen to look for it when she came back she told me to wait 7 more minutes 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ I said its already 20 minutes! I don't blame the new girl.

<Review>It's a great value but the only detail is that the employees are always fumbling when it comes to the kiosk portal for online orders. somehow you're always forced to stand in line and still ask for your order. It's defeating their purpose of The online and portal. It's taken away the customer convenience.<//Review>< Rating>

<text>Love their $6 pizzas and garlic cheese bread. Only down side is they r usually out of the $6 hot n ready pizzas and they take too long to wait for them to cook one. They need to have less employees behind the counter n standing by the drive thru window so that they might be able to have room to move n actually speed up their cook times.</text>< Pics>

<username>Roxanna Navarro</username><review>Made a pre order to pick up in store and the store was closed, so we had to wait 1 hour to get our pizza. Not only that but our pizza was horribly sliced. I would have appreciated to see on the app that the store pick up stopped at 9, I would appreciate it more if they made pick ups walk-ins only and orders at drive-thru. WORST EXPERIENCE!< /review>< response>

<Review>I Love this place and I have always had a good experience it's also good when I want to feed my family a quick dinner. Everyone loves it. It's also a affordable place to get food for dinner, birthday parties and get togethers. The best part is they have a drive thru. They are the only little caesars I know of that has a drive thru.< /Review>< pics>

I live closer to the Lake and I'm closer to the one on riverside drive I choose not to go to that 1 because the pizza is better at the Little Caesars on 4th street so I commute about 25 minutes just to pick up my pizza and it's been 2 times that I get there and my order is not ready even though I phoned it in 30 min  prior to arriving at the drive-through window,  I would have given this place 5 stars because the quality of the pizza is the best but definitely not for customer service and/or the way they handle the orders.</Text>

<review>Their pizza is good, as long as you don't get the $5 "hot-n-ready", they're made so differently from the rest of their items, which is the only thing they have ready. Anything else you're going to have to wait 25+ minutes. The $5 pizza is gross, they put way too much sauce, not enough cheese, barely any pepperoni, and the crust is much thinner. Any other pizza on their menu is great though. I don't understand why they have the "Extra most bestest" for a dollar more. That should be their standard for the $5 one.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Its little Caesars , pizza is ok for the money . The only issue I have is priority . Online order should have priority over any order . When I order a pizza a 530 and says to pick up at 6. O expect some delay but waiting till 7pm. And watching as they hand your pizzas to drive through and walk is frustrating.

They tale people orders and give them to drive through .< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>So I ordered my items online and they were not ready this being the second time I was not pleads however they gave me an extra pizza because of the delayed time so they made up for their delayed time. I just strongly feel that they should hire more people so that way the dining or pick up customers don't have to wait over an hour while the drive-thru customers only wait 15 minutes</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

•this location only has $5 pizzas, and if you ask for anything else the answer is always the same..”it will be ready in 30-40 min..🧐..really ? That long?🧐seems a little off to me

Placed order online, waited 30 minutes instead of the 15 minutes they said it would in be ready in. I  drive to go get them and still had to wait another 38 minutes before my order of 3 pizzas were ready. I came home to uncooked looking pizza. Little Caesars needs a better system of getting the pizzas out in a timely manner and cooked properly.<//review>

<review>Cool that we got a somewhat bigger little Caesars and a drive through but the old one always had hot and ready $5 pepperoni no matter what and never got asked to wait 20+ mins... I come in and ask for a $5 pepperoni pizza and get told we don't have any and do you want this kind or this kind or the $6 one etc, why would I want anything other than what I asked for??

<review>Much nicer than what it used to be Faster service friendlier people and good however And this is about the pizza not the place
The extra most bestest is now 6 which has the same amount of pepperoni as it did before and now the 5 dollar pizza has less to make it look like the other has more but they just switched prices and made one way less so people would buy the same pizza they did before just a dollar more now and they call it value..... it's good on s budget or when you have big household or super young pizza and place good just wanted to point that out there .< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dc9f800b31256b:0xb4c8f3682f4fec6<//gmapID></record>

The pizza is really good. And the fact that they made a drive thru feels like we can get our pizza a little quicker< /text>

i order a pizza at the drive through and gave me the wrong order. CHECK YOUR PIZZA!! i called and they told me i can get a free pizza but i have to bring in the lid of the pizza box. i understand they do this so its proof of the pizza you bought. but its so much work to drive their rip the lid of pizza box if you remember bring in receipt, this is a good way to prevent people from lying but sucks for those who are telling the truth and have to do uncessary work all this could of been avoided if they gave me my right pizza!!. drive through takes forever customer service sucks ass. the old one was better.<//text>

Unacceptable wait times in the drive-thru (20 mins)and the homeless vagrants always hang out there.  I asked for paper plates but they had ran out. I asked what flavor sodas they had and I was told they only had Pepsi. I was given a warm 2 Liter and when I asked for a cold one I was told that the refrigerator was broken. SMH</text>

They did me the favor of adding extra sauce on my buffalo wings and gave us our order in 3-5 minutes instead of 10-12 minutes. Very kind cashiers (5:25pm of 3/15/2020)<//review>

<text>I try to avoid this place as much as possible which is sad because I love Little caesars. Everytime I come here there's at least a 30 minute wait with a line of cars and people put of the door/driveway it's like the owner is too cheap to fully staff his restaurant. Go to literally any other pizza place the prices are not worth your sanity!!!!This time I tried to order over the app so I didn't have to deal with any of the lovely workers and it took over an hour to get my order. Have some pride in your business and customer service. Everyone should boycott for a day then maybe they would take a hint!!! If I could leave less than a star I would!!!</text>< pics>

<Text>I ordered a thin crust and a stuffed crust and they gave me a regular pizza. Then I called and they made me speak to three people the first being the a cashier, the second a manager, who said to the third person,"here can you deal with this give her a refund or something." After that they just told me that they would redo my order. When we showed up they said that they hadn't even heard about the complaint and would just  make it again after making us wait 15 mins plus the 30 minutes before. Then when they finally gave us the order they messed up on the toppings.<//Text><response>None<//response><time>1562210730150<//time>< user_name>

Hot, fresh, & ready.....
False advertisement!!!
Go there weekly since it opened at all different times & never have I experienced any of those... 20 minutes + wait to be told 20 minute wait for anything to be ready.
Poorly managed & it's sad because we all have been little ceaser fan's  for years & this place just can't get it together...
Hopefully they can figure it out!</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>EVERY TIME I order from this one, online order, theres always an issue. They give my order away, they have the order incorrect, they cant find my order, it's never ready on time... ever! When asked for compensation, it's like pulling teeth. The wait is forever long after I get there when I get an email confirmation saying it is ready. The one time I decided to go like 10 minutes after my pizza was said to be done, I was told by the manager because I took so long to get there, they gave away my food. Which of course resulted in me having then to wait like 30-45 mins for my pizzas. I got home, and low and behold, the pizzas were wrong and it was someone else's order. Sorry to the lady that didnt receive her extra most bestest.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>If I could give none I would. I came in April 5th at night. It was basically teenagers party, including the manager on duty. Laughing could barely take orders. Literally the worst customers service to the point you would think they spit in your food. They charged us for an extra pizza we went in fixed it. That's not all we get home I eat 2 slices of pizza and 3 crazy bread felt sick all night til I puked so violently I burst blood vessels in my face. Never eating there again.<//text>< gmapID>

The old Place always had them ready and if they didn't it was only a 10-15 minute wait

The lady dressed in blue which I'm thinking is supervisor or manager just walks around yelling and complaining but doesn't seem like she's actually helping she's just stressing out the the employees

Worst experience and customer service ! I ordered in the drive thru and when I asked for a deep dish they said it would be a 30 minute wait. I told them never mind I’ll take a basic hot and ready. I literally waited in the sun for 50 minutes almost an hour !!!!! I called and spoke with 2 separate managers who said there was nothing they can do I would just have to wait due to them being “short staff” . At 7 months pregnant hungry and in the heat I’ll never return to little Cesar’s pizza ever again !< /review>

Barely been open, so it has a lot of traffic almost all the time. Overall, what you pay is what you get. Fast pizza at cheap prize. No complaints, I understand the constant traffic.<//Review>

Pizza was hot! The only thing I dislike is I was paying with 100$ bill they said no I digged in my purse and found exact change and when I was handing change the Girl dropped a quarter she looked at me and was like I'm sorry did not even say oh I will go get it or send some one I had to dig in my purse and get another quarter!! That is very unprofessional @ McDonald's they send someone out to pick up change I mean yeah it's just a quarter but I don't have lots of quarters just sitting in my purse!!! And there was like 15+ people in the front I mean employees so some one could of came out!!! And there was 3 girls standing at the drive thru they closed the windows and I could tell they were saying something!! Very rude but oh well I pay their wages God bless these young worker's!! I hope they learn to appreciate what they got going now!! When I started working I was making 4.50 an hour!!!! @ fast food....</review>

<Review>One star is over rating them but unfortunately we cant do no stars. This place keeps getting worse. First it was ridiculous wait times, and things seem to get worse as the days go by. Last couple time pizza has been cold. On one occasion they left the whole pizza cutter in the box. Like really. And today was just the end for me. Pizza was once again cold but not only that crazy bread was raw. Still doughy looking on one end. I really thought getting a bigger location or drive thru would of helped them better. Not the case here. Honestly i feel they were much better at the old location. I dont recall any of these problems. Maybe some wait times but not even close to now. Definitely wouldn't recommend.</Review>< pics>

<Name>Mike Hernandez<//Name><gmap_id>0x80dc9f800b31256b:0xb4c8f3682f4fec6</gmap_id><review>So many wrongs where do I even begin.
First off there was a twenty minute wait for one "most bestest" pizza, this was with just one customer seated in the waiting area; and two in the drive thru - remember this is around 8pm on a Monday night. The "hot and ready" I was able to get had a deformed crust, and was poorly mad. The cooler of sodas only had grape soda.
I wondered what the 10 people who were working that were actually doing?
Perris should have a Northside location Little Cesar's and until they do I will go else where.
Really pathetic here.< /review>< resp>

And the employees seem to get mad wen you ask for the manager to see why the pizza is not ready I think corporate should come and supervise this store just so they see how there employees are or why they mess up orders</Review>< user>

This location sucks. They never have ANYTHING hot and ready, no matter what time of day you go. I went through the drive thru earlier this evening and tried to order wings. Was told that they didn’t have any available because they ran out of the containers. When I got to the window, they tried to hand me a pizza and wings. I told them that wasn’t my order and the girl laughed and said “oh sorry that’s the order behind you.” I then confronted her and said “I thought you guys were out of wings?” She then told me “Oh yeah. We were saving a couple because we were running low.”. Apparently my money doesn’t spend the same as the guy behind me.< /review>

Ordered online for drive thru pick up.  Got there at the time it was suppose to be ready and it wasn't.  We had to park and wait 10 minutes . Then go inside to get order or drive thru again.  Might as well just ordered  it there.</Text>

Had to park across the street about a 15 minute wait. When I ordered they gave me my food then I went to pay and it wasn't until then they told me they didn't accept anything over a $20 I had a $50 I could understand if it was late and she was alone but it was 3:30 with like 5 workers there and like 15 customers. I also asked if I could go next door to break it real quick and she said I would have to get in the back of the line she was very rude and wasn't courteous at all. I will not be going back to this location no longer.<//Text>

<review>Very good pizza, but I believe the employees need to be trained on answering the phones correctly and not being so short with the customers. I was rushed through that transaction took no less then a minute but asking for the specails seemed like it was hurting her.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Always a wait for "hot and ready" pizza... And last 2 times there was "hot and ready" it was old dry pizza.  In their defense, they're always slammed, but corporate should get another pizza oven for this location to help prevent further disappointment...< /Review>

Worst service ever I don’t know why they have a drive thru if they don’t know how to run it or keep up with the customers I waited 30 min in line just to get my order and then another 30 min to get my pizza! This place needs to really needs to hire more people or customers are really going to starve 😡 I’m just goin to stick to Pizza Hut it’s better pizza and better service I so regret coming to this place btw everything else that you need to special order theirs like an hour wait which is ridiculous<//text>

<text>I thought this place would be quick because the drive thru. Boy I was WRONG. When I got the drive thru the lady working the window cut me off mid order and said it was a 20 minuet wait. So I got to the window paid for my order and it a 30 minuet wait. I went inside and they kept asking me “what did you order?” Clearly it was lost. This place either needs more people or needs to creat a sense of urgency amongst its staff. I am just glad that I received my food before closing! Never coming back again.</text>< Pictures>

Ive ate my fare share of pizza, dined at many locations but ive never encountered such horrible service, horrible idea of putting a drive thru especially if its a pizza joint. I came by on my lunch hour and was told, rudely that it was gona be at least an hour. Another time i came by i called ahead and ordered my pizza and when i arrive the door is locked, i was told to go thru the drive thru, ugggh. Good grief<//text>

I got pizza here this past Monday evening. It was just teenagers working there. They did not seem to care much about customer service in the way they address me, but I was able to get my pizza right away when I ordered.

I ate 3 slices of the pizza. The next day I started to get stomach cramps. I didn’t pay much attention to it, but soon I started to get really sick. It’s been 3 days feeling this way I am going to the ER today to find out what happen.

Hopefully this is an isolated event and not related to the cleanliness of the restaurant.</review>

We went today I ask for a cheese pizza the guy said we don't have cheese pizza u want anything else. We said no tanks I said I'm allergic 2 pork that's why. I ask him do u have cheese pizzas his like yes it would be 20min.I said ok  wich I thaugt it was 2 much time.I waited almost 1 hour. Got the pizza and got home and it had 2 pieces of sausage when l said I was allergic 2 pork highly allergic. So I saw they don't pay attention 2 peoples allergies its kinda dangerous I think. So me personally not coming back 2 that little Cesars pizza.</Text>

I order a pizza from these ppl and one of the slices was missing, besides someone eating your food you got to worry about the bad smell of bums and mfs asking you for change. I will not support this business no more and I will see that the news and media hears about how you treat your customers.</text>

Either the wait they quote is tripled, they give burnt crazy bread or they have none, the toppings at one point were all in the center. Ive submitted tons of complaints but nothing has happened. We come here as an emergency meal when we dont want to cook or spend too much.but i guess you get what u pay for< /Review>< pictures>

Always a wait, always, no matter how few customers they're attending. Always out of the 6 dollar pizza, always a 25 minute wait for that pizza, I dont understand how they have a full staff yet cant seem to keep pizzas ready to go, the old location never had that problem, last time I go there ever,<//Text>

< review>
I ordered two pizzas and one came with barely any cheese and I call the store to let them know because I did not want to make a bad review but they left me on hold for 5 minutes without saying a word or to stay on the line, but the phone was on and working because I heard workers in the back talking dirt.<//review>
