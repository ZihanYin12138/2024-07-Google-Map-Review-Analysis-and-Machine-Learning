<text>I was looking for a haircut within the week and they were the only place available and I’m so glad I came here for the first time! Isabel did my hair and I loved it and she was so nice. She understood what I wanted and gave me what I asked for. The place is spacious and definitely felt safe getting a haircut here. I will definitely come again in the future!< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>Dude! After having gone through a few hair salons for bleach/color (after usually DIY'ing bleach/color at home the majority of the time), I've found the perfect hair salon in SB! Jacky definitely took great care of me. I received a lot of good advice for aftercare & whatnot. All of the people I interacted with were super friendly & inviting. Thanks for making my birthday awesome!<//Text></record>

Great location, always have good results but there is a caveat.

Be very clear with your stylist about costs.  They all work as independent contractors and will offer services without identifying the price.  I had to switch stylists after my favorite one left, and I assumed the prices would  be the same (my ignorance and I didn't check) but at checkout the service was $50 more.  Grrrr.  My $120 bill went to $170.

When I returned to the same stylist she asked if I wanted a hair cut.  I explained no, I would come back for that as I am on a budget and her price point was different than my previous stylist.  All good.  She colored my hair and did low lights.  She asked if I wanted my hair blow dried and I confirmed - I thought she was asking as she was 20 minutes late for my 11:30 appointment and I had a 1:30 work meeting.

I got to the check out and my bill was - again, $170!  I was shocked and the kind receptionist showed me I had been charged $50 for styling, the same price as a haircut.  I have never  been charged for blowdrying my hair after a coloring process.  This seemed out of integrity for me.  Prices are posted no where and she was aware I was on a budget.

I am perfectly happy paying for good services and tipping well.  My plan had been a $25 tip on top of a $120 bill.

There was a line and I had a meeting I had to log onto immediately so I couldn't address it at the time but I have contacted the owner.<//Review>

Getting a haircut with a new hairstylist can be a bit daunting especially if you have had disastrous results in the past - either with cuts, colors or perms or any of these in different combinations.
From my first appointment I was made to feel welcomed and comfortable, offered a beverage and enjoyed a consultation were I felt that the stylist was listening to my preferences and my concerns.
I try to have my hair cut/trimmed & colored every 4 to 6 weeks. And I try to keep this up even when we have a heavy work/travel schedule. Sean has been my stylist for the better part of the past 3 years. So glad I was able to find him! Keeping up on my hair routine has never been so stress free. Wonderful salon, great staff.< /Review>

Worst experience today. Asked for Carmel in my hair and I left 3.5 hours later with fried hair after three attempts to correct. Left with no Carmel and hair I could have done myself with a box from cvs. Never going back. Disappointed is an understatement.< /Text>

I was in town for two days and Jackie was able to provide me a consultation and squeeze me into her busy schedule that same day. I showed her many pictures of unicorn hair, rainbow hair, etc. She did a fabulous job understanding what I desired and a true artist when she designed the color schemes and placements. Thanks Jackie! You are amazing!</Text>

<text>Hair cut and highlights/bayalage. Hair cut is perfect but my color is not perfect at all. I'm not sure how to even describe what it looks like, all I do know is I'm not happy at all. I will need to go elsewhere and try and have my hair salvaged. I expected more after 3.5 hrs of being there.

What a special ensemble cast of stylists who make you feel welcome and pampered. Sean and Pui, the owners, have high standards of professionalism and their staff exceeds expectations.
Yesterday, I had a 9 a.m. appointment with my one-of-a-kind go-to guy Gabe. He came down with a cold/the flu and I was contacted by 8:35 to save me a wasted trip to The Color Room. I asked if Tiffany was available, but she was booked solid. Fortunately for me, she had a cancellation. Mickey called to give me the good news. Gabe let Tiffany know my hair color mixture/formula and she worked her magic. Seamless, excellent customer service! I love my cut (as usual).
If you have trouble expressing exactly what you want in color or cut, they will work with you toward great results. The staff is like family and I feel blessed to visit them every month.<//Text><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x80e914c2fa20a681:0xb12502f5f1107c07</gmap_id>< Date>

I made an appointment for my girlfriend. She had never been to the Color Room before and was really looking forward to getting her haircut. Unfortunately she left the salon disappointed. Her layers were really poorly done and she felt that the stylist rushed through the end of her haircut because her next appointment had arrived. She is so dissatisfied with her cut, she has decided  to make an appointment elsewhere to fix it.</text>

I just move here from out of state, and my hair was ridiculous from all the horrible salons that I went to in Ut. So my sister-in-law recommended the color room to fix my problem hair. From the first moment I met Gabe I felt totally comfortable. I asked him to cut off 10"!!! And give me an A-line bob!! He did such a great job!!! My hair looks amazing and everyone that has seen it LOVES it!! Gabe is the best!! I am fully confedent in his ability, and I will be going to him for the rest of my life!! LOVE MY HAIR RIGHT NOW!!</Text>

Pui is simply the real creative deal: a truly inspired and versatile hair stylist! A seasoned professional in all the best senses. Honest, dedicated and adept, she works her magic on me and I walk away thrilled and always a bit dazzled.  Then there are all those compliments I get on my hair afterward... and I just say, Goto Pui at the Color Room!  She's terriff!</text>

I feel like this review was a mistake or even a sabotage. Their is no written review so it’s hard to know what the problems was?  I saw that you gave a one star review and I was wondering why? And if there is anything I can do to help! Or if this was merely a mistake?  Thanks Sean'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Low key ice cream joint, don't be turned off by the lack of decor or sketchy area the flavors are actually good! I parked in the lot on the side, most of the spots are 15 min only so I would try to find a parking spot in the lot other than the street. We got a triple with pistchio cucumber and Turkish coffee. All different and intriguing flavors. definitely get the unique flavors as opposed to your standard chocolate chip since you can get that anywhere.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Great Ice Cream! I'm so happy that they offer their signature flavor as a vegan option as well. The flavors of their quality ingredients really shine through. The deserts are light on the tongue and very delicious!< /Text>

<review>Interesting, delicious flavors! The pomegranate flavor and cucumber were really good - the pomegranate was like a sorbet and the cucumber was creamier. The staff was very friendly. Would definitely go again.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I love the Coldstone in Torrance & the one in Culver City. We went to this one a few times, because we were in  Hollywood & we were hoping that it was a one time questionable experience. But the ice cream is consistently not the high quality that we are used to from the other locations. To frozen, not fresh, they are stingy with their toppings & have a don't bother me - I am doing you a favor that I am serving you attitude. Mediocre doesn't even begin to describe the experience.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Another great location for devilishly delightful Ice Cream. Handcrafted waffle cones, design your own and 10 flavors to choose from. Counter service with seating on the deck, wheelchair accessible via elevators.</Text>

<review>I wish I could finally say something negative about the places I have tried in this area,  but again Milk was awesome. I had nutella ice cream and my husband had cinnamon apple crumble both were high marks but the nutella was fantastic smooth and creamy, it was so good I couldn't leave without buying a pint frozen a little pricey but so worth it. This is my go to ice cream place from now on, they also have so many other items that look and are just as good.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bf23c3bb14c7:0xf4eea11e7c58233b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is the worst cold stone I've ever been to, I didn't think you could have a bad experience at an ice cream place... But here it is. The guy pushed on upselling ice cream. He didn't even seem to care to scoop he scratched it, I barely got any ice cream. There were flies all over the toppings, which means this place isn't clean. I can tell because it was 40 degrees outside, so the pest had to be growing in the warm humidity of the store. Do yourself a favor and avoid this location.< /Text>

This place is deadly if you are trying to lose weight. But super rewarding if you stressed. The rich ice cream truly hits the spot for anyone's sweet tooth</text>

<text>They break A LOT of health code violations. They don’t wash their hands after being on their phones and using cleaning rags before touching the ice cream. They don’t wear gloves when scooping ice cream (I’ve worked at an ice cream location before and it’s health code to wear gloves when handling).
I’ve seen employees leave cleaning solutions on the table area where the ice cream is mixed and they did not wipe it down before placing ice cream on it.
Then I’ve seen employees ignore customers allergy information and cross contaminate the food. The lady made it clear she’s allergic to one of the flavors they just put on one of their prep boards. They didn’t clean the board or anything. And continued to place her ice cream on it, when she brought this to their attention they gave her attitude.
Completely unprofessional.

On top of that, the way Lydia or whatever the heck her name is, treats her employees is just plain rude. I can see why there’s always a low staff or new employees. She comes off as just another attitude filled millennial trying to run a business.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This cold stone is very sneaky. They trick you and your unsuspecting children into adding more toppings without letting you know it’s going to cost extra. Jacky pulled this on some young kids who didn’t want to spend so much. They don’t have good customer service otherwise she wouldn’t have charged them when it was brought to her attention that she purposely tricked them. I’ve never had this happen at any other cold stone before. We are very disappointed with this store and won’t be back. Will head to the Ben and Jerry’s downstairs.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I have been tricked by employee @ this cold stone and they are very sneaky. They trick me and my kids  into adding more toppings without letting me know it’s going to cost extra. The employee asked the kids like an option that you can pick either Chocolate source or sprinkles and also they lied me and didn’t answer straight forward when I asked ‘are they going to charge extra for it.’ I paid $34 for three small cups of ice-cream. They don’t have good customer service otherwise she wouldn’t have charged them when it was brought to her attention that she purposely tricked them. I’ve never had this happen at any other cold stone before. We are very disappointed at this place.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>The ice cream is good, and the staff are friendly. Just make sure you read the sign saying each additional topping is $1! This is my reason for the 3 stars... Your rediculous pricing for ice cream!! For a regular size plus a few toppings you're already over $10 and this only includes the cup, no cone - that's an extra $1.49-3.49! Just doesn't seem worth it to me. Oh...and since your prices are so rediculous, you could at the very least validate parking!!!< /text><username>Bradley Bingham<//username><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Review>We came in on a Tuesday afternoon and there was no line. I got eggnog the and babka - both were delicious! Eggnog had a slight kick to it thanks to the brandy. It wasn't too strong which was to my liking. The babka had tasty chunks of cinnamon bread, and had just the right amount of sweetness. All in all a delicious cone!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I found very similar flavors at Cold Stone Creamery. Mainly taro, tai, green tea and other similar flavors were offered. Only reason I have a 3 Star, was because I didn't feel like there were different variety of flavors, they were all flavors of same category. I wish that next time that I stop by, there will be more exciting flavors offered.< /Review>

There was a huge line and there was only one person working the front and her name was Samantha she moved the line rather quickly and was very helpful with explaining the menu and was overall very polite. Great customer service, tipped her $10. She deserves a raise.<//Text>

They rip you off. Ask you if you want toppings or cones and then don’t tell you how much that add on was till you’re paying. They don’t tell you that every topping you add to make birthday cake costs and isn’t included with ordering the flavored ice cream. Even though on the picture, next to the item name and price,  the ice cream will have a waffle cone and toppings as if included with the order and as if it’ll cost what the price next to it says. But nope.

Basically this place is misleading and rips you off.<//text>

FRIDAY NIGHT, 10 pm. there's a line of like 10 people and only one associate. Josh worked efficiently to help all the customers get their icecream as quick as possible. ALL ALONE, it was a great experience. totally deserves a raise!< /review>

<Text>Coldstone's is delicious but this location needs a new manager. There are 11 people in line, self included and one person working. 1 order covers a workers hourly pay sooo... ? There needs to be more people on staff. People are quiting? Give them raises and treat them better.</Text><user_name>Alex Banx<//user_name><time>1487462681962</time><gmap_id>0x80c2bf23c3bb14c7:0xf4eea11e7c58233b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>My wife and I love Cold Stone but we had a terrible experience at this location. When we walked in no one was at the counter so we had to wait for the girl working there to come out from the back. The music she was playing was rather inappropriate for a family centered environment (f word several times). She acted rather put off that we were even there. I asked to have half of one ice cream and half of another and her attitude filled reply was "We don't do that." Lastly, we wanted to validate parking and when I asked her, once again, her reply was "We won't do that." The she headed right into the back area while we were still standing there. Not one to complain, but if that was my business I'd want to know if my employee was treating a customer that way.<//review>< Pictures>

The only reason it deserves 3 stars is because of the price. It’s absurd to charge almost $10 for the smallest size! I was such a shock it made my ice cream taste bad ☹️< /text>

<rating>1</rating><review>(Translated by Google) Terriable !! Worst! Trash !!!!! I do not know what the topping will add to the price and how many topping are included in. So i payed just one small ice cream 17.8 dollers. Also, I did not give me the reciept. So when i told him to get reciept, he made it inmediately. Employee is crazy man. It's the worst garbage.
I added a base addition of topping and said no, and I added eight and said it was $ 17.
I do not give you a receipt, I do not explain it, so I'll take it back and give it back. This is the expression. Koreans never go

외국인이라고 토핑 기본 추가를 말도 안하고 동의도 안얻고 8개나 추가하고 17달러라고 했습니다.
영수증도 주지 않고 설명도 안하고 따지니까 그제서야 그럼 토핑다시 걸러서 주고 돈 돌려줄께. 이러는 식입니다. 한국인분들 절대 가지마세요</review>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I've been to Coldstone many times, but it's the first spring I've given you. There's also one male and one cheap blueberry. What is the chocolate chip? This branch uses dry blueberries ㅡ ㅡ Even the smallest size is always so hard to eat. The place should be ruined

(Translated by Google) Staff fully flocked; Want to choose toppings? Rather than asking like this, do you want peanut butter or chocolate? I keep asking like this .. After answering a few times, I added a lot of toppings and it is already mixed with ice cream.

(Original)
직원이 완전 양아치;;  토핑 선택할래? 이렇게 묻는게 아니라 피넛버터랑 초콜릿 중 뭐할래? 이런식으로 계속 물어봄.. 몇번 대답하다보면 엄청 토핑 추가되어서 이미 아이스크림과 섞여있음... 아이스크림 샀는데 음료수도 팔라고 하고 도네이션도 하라고 함ㅋㅋㅋ 외국인한테 쓰는 수법인듯...</review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>We ordered take out tonight for dinner (4/16/2021) and the reasoning for the 2 stars was mainly the food quality.

Service was great, friendly staff in the front who welcomed us in.

Here is a list of each food item ordered and my review:

1. Thai basil chicken: taste was okay but my goodness the amount of oil in this dish is insane! A simple dish with chicken and veggies is overwhelmed with way too much oil.

2. Drunken noodle with chicken: taste was good, not a lot of chicken and same with the basil chicken, it is a bit on the more oily side but these noodle dishes tend to be oily so it was okay.

3. Pineapple friend rice with chicken: very basic disappointing dish with very little taste. No chicken was found in the dish.

4. Eggplant chicken: this dish was the best out of the four I got. Taste was good and portion was decent as well.

Overall this place was disappointing tonight, but I'm willing to give this place another try in the future.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4u4GCPQ_zhjQsKxabNK75MgcQ81qlWxAAv_m_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSgeiVhu7I1KZlvpqstM3YWXOBzobXr8N9vbiX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVLFI8amuFGfUPFl-jvC5bokMEiLe4yA0hjlHP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_wpA1b4NBkIIrlQzmY98YJoiQ-xwCCHOXrz2R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6T7NYIJPV56rGUG4YPq5J2WLookccZdG7G--a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6SGCnpexR5vfoT-zcYJbWjLmJ-mfzJlOUNDrY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809ad11df71051a3:0x93d23cfcd0fa686d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Okayyyy I used to come here all the time about 2 years ago and went today the avocado curry WAS the best thing. Check the reviews, don't be fooled though its completely different now, no eggplant, pure liquid , just overall I'm sure the owners are different. It's not nasty but it is 120% not what you think if you are coming for avocado curry. Maybe just call it yellow curry with avocado.</Text>

I was quarantined due to travel and was having to eat alone on Thanksgiving. It was late and almost all restaurants were closed. I ordered from Chada right before they closed, hoping my order would go through. Not only did it go through, but my driver texted me ahead to tell me that the restaurant was sending me a “present”. When the driver arrived, he had a whole other bag of food waiting for me — rolls, and rice and another full meal. I couldn’t believe it. So generous and I now refer to it as the Thanksgiving Miracle as it was much needed and greatly appreciated. It didn’t hurt that all the food was amazing and delicious. Thank you Chada!<//Text>

It was good. The portions are really generous.. I couldn't even finish all the food. They did mix up one item on my order which is why I'm only giving them 3 stats but that's ok.  It was still good.</Text>

<name>Nestor Finney< /name><review>There are two Thai places next to each other on this block; there's supposedly a story behind it. I won't pretend to know. But for years, our friends said let's go to the other one. We have been missing out on Chada as a result. The service is friendly and prompt, the space is bright and lovely. My friend and I enjoyed drunken noodles, cashew stir fry, brown rice, and made sure to keep room for mango sticky rice. It is exactly what you'd expect, comforting and lovely and a great place to sit and relax in the heat of Sacramento.</review><GmapID>0x809ad11df71051a3:0x93d23cfcd0fa686d< /GmapID><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

< Review>
Excellent environment and great customer  service! The Grubhub  driver that wrote the awful review down below was the girl who delivered me the wrong order and was very unprofessional but the restaurant made it right for me and remade my order very quickly! Their food is very authentic  and they really care about their customers! I would recommend to any friend the most excellent Thai in Chico is Chada Thai!!!<//Review>

Can only speak to takeout right now, but I love the pad thai and egg rolls! The pad thai has a great mix of complex flavors and textures no matter what protein you get, though I'm partial to shrimp or chicken. The egg rolls were crispy without being greasy and the plum sauce was subtly sweet, not overbearing. The staff have been friendly every time I've picked up my order, too. I can't wait to dine in and look forward to trying more dishes!</review>

The food was really good.  My wife ordered a chef’s special which was way too spicy for her and asked for replacement- they charged us for it!  They said since they used a fish they have to charge it.  Other then this, everything else was awesome.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Once you introduce someone to the food, they quickly become regulars. I tend to eat Thai food when I travel. It's my favorite cuisine. When at home in Sacramento, I eat it exclusively at Chada. The food is delicious and the family/staff are delightful. After a few times dining there, they remember orders and make great recommendations. I have a food allergy and they carefully accommodate it.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Thai food should not be this bland. My dad and I had drunken noodles with pork and green curry with chicken; my daughter had chicken satay and fried calamari. Of those, the chicken satay was decently flavorful, and the green curry had some nice coconut flavor but not much spice. The calamari was especially bland and rubbery, and coated in a heavy, greasy batter. For dessert we had mango and sticky rice. The mango was good, but the rice was dry and hard.

Service was OK, and the restaurant was reasonably clean, but overall I can't recommend Chada.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809ad11df71051a3:0x93d23cfcd0fa686d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love Chada Thai! The mango curry is sooooo yummy, and so is the lemongrass beef. My sister loves the avocado curry. The service is quick so it's a great lunch spot if you have limited time.<//review>

Delicious & Excellent customer service! We will be returning to eat here again. We had the yello curry, not spicy but thick and very flavorful and the asparagus chicken lunch plate which was full of other veggies along with the asparagus & chicken. Thai iced tea is a must!< /Review>

Update: New management. They are not the same. I may try again if they work out the opening details. They did not have my favorite duck curry that day, shrimp were not deveined in the soup, and the beef salad had tough beef. It used to be shaved and tender.

Best Thai food I've had in Norcal hands down. Try the duck curry and beef salad or shrimp lemongrass soup. Superb.</Text>

<Review>I went there because of the 4.5 stars but it is the worst thai place that I have ever been to. The food taste bad, the server had the attitude. Never been to Thai place where they don't serve rice with curry..I had to order extra rice for my red curry. The food was not authentic. Also there was no parking. I don't recommend this place.< /Review>< user>

<review>Very elegant and soothing vibe in the restaurant. I felt very welcomed and relaxed. Im a very picky thai orderer so it was helpful to know what it looked like on the menu before as well. I had the papaya salad with shrimp it was perfectly spicy and so delicious I've never had a thai salad before so that was amazing to have as a first thai salad. We also ordered the pad Thai hot and my oh my it was so juicy not watery by any means it was just perfect the noodles were cooked to perfection I've never had any noodle like those I loved. I thanked the chef afterwards cause well when I like something it deserves the appreciation.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Was over charged on parts. Payed 500 for a "custom" 4inch spindle just for passenger side which means it did match the driver side. So I found out company they got spindle from and they charged me 400 shipped. They also replaced upper and lower control arm bushings which i feel i was over charged for. They charged me to take off old parts and truck was there 3weeks. In the end i payed 1400 bucks for something ima do the other side for under 1000. They do good work just over priced.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<userid>102407593009235834187< /userid><pics>None</pics><Text>Super disappointed with lack of communication and unprofessionalism.
I took my car in due to a check engine light and asked them to recharge the AC and do a tune up as well. We picked the car up later that evening, paid a around $630 and brought the car home, only to find out the AC was not working. (Probably didn't get checked after the recharge was done, but hey mistakes happen) We brought the car back on a Thursday. WE called later to check in and were told it was the "o" rings that had to be replaced on the compressor =$124. We felt that was an overcharge for such a quick inexpensive fix but decided to move forward with the work so it would be warranted, plus we're all about supporting the local family  businesses. We didn't hear back from them on Thursday, finally on Friday I called them around 4pm to be told, its still not working, we cant figure it out, were working on it and I will call you before we close to give you an update. Never heard back. Now their closed Saturday and Sunday. On Monday at 3(ish)pm I CALLED THEM, only to be told their machine wasn't working, but they were getting it fixed and would have my car back to me ASAP. I asked if that meant they would be keeping my car another night, Dave told me, most likely, but I'll call you back when I know more. No Call. On Tuesday at 2:30pm I get a call to be told the whole AC system is corrupt and needs to be replaced for $2000. I told the employee, Dave, I would come get the car. I was unhappy with the lack of communication and really dont feel we can trust them. When I got to the shop to pick up my car I was charged the $124 for the "o" rings. I told Dave, how do I know that was done? I drove by multiple times Friday, Monday and today and my car wasn't being worked on till this morning? That seems very sketchy to me. At this point another woman in the office- I didn't get her name- got very loud and told me I was wrong! The car was worked on all day Friday and Monday. She got up out of her chair and stepped towards me raising her finger at me and getting loud. I asked her, This is how you treat your customers? I haven't raised my voice or done anything disrespectful to you, and she said "BECAUSE YOUR WRONG!!!!!"
Let me say, I paid my bill and left, I will never step foot in that shop again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I know! I'm sure I got scammed and work wasn't actually done on my car, but I paid anyways and got out of that place!<//Text></record>

Best diesel shop in the Lancaster/Palmdale area and I have tried them all, owning over 10 chevy diesel  trucks in 30 years.

Worst customer service ever. I called last week to get a appointment they said come in today at 8 am. I got there before they opened went in inside and was told that they already took too many cars in this morning and wold have to come back latter remind you I have a appointment. They act like they don't want your buisness.  They came highly recomended. Stating new owner better service. Same crapp service different owner. Don't even bother wasting your time or money.</text>

Very great staff bless them all, I had a stubborn 6.0 diesel they had done ,high pressure oil work to the engine, basically an overhaul of the engine did a great job! So glad we have some down to earth mechanic shops around the A.V. thanks, I always recommend The shop.< /Text>

<Review>Took my car here after it stalled on me due to an electrical issue. They were able to diagnose the problem, call me with different affordable options on fixing it and had my car ready in a week. It only took a week because I didn't get back to them right away but, it's been several months now and my car still runs like brand new! Thanks to these guys! I would always recommend and do business with them .< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c25c62b702e827:0xa8b9e3b70c77281b</gmapID></record>

<Text>Took my car in to have an engine swapped. Original blew and was just replacing with the same type nothing special or mods. When I Picked up the car The AC didn’t work anymore along with the fuses blown out for the AC. My Serpentine belt was squeaky and eventually ripped the new belt that was replaced funny how a different shop I took it to put a new belt on in about 20 minutes and drove out with it not squeaking anymore. Months later Im replacing my radiator which just organically went out but in the process I notice a lot of clips are broken and just got hot glued back in place, probably from when the removal of the front end to replace the engine was done. Along with lots of screws missing that weren’t put on just out of pure laziness because theres 2 more screws holding up the part the mechanic didn’t think it needed the third. At first I was satisfied with the work since I paid a hefty price for the engine swap trusting this is a good shop but no this shop blows and I should of gone with someone that would of charged me less working out of their garage and would of delivered the same quality of work.</Text>< Name>

<Review>Inviting and welcoming. Love how they support our troops an America. After dealing with (the shop) for the last 2 years I dont go anywhere eles.
As a mechanic myself, I dont trust many with the expensive/unique cars I own, I feel comfortable dropping off my cars an getting comprehensive diagnosis or Supreme work for my money.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

( Micheal was not with the customer the day she picked up her car)..I explained to the customer,The step daughter. That while checking why her a/c was not working the technician noticed that the water pump has crusty wet coolant built up at the bottom of her water pump and we recommended replacing it.Also the serpentine had small cracks...So the quote I gave her for the a/c included the water pump and belt and coolant and labor for the water pump..When she came in the first time it wasn't her radiator! It was her cylinder coolant outlet housing that was leaking at that time..so there is a miss communication between stepdad and step daughter..That is not how we do business..See in the shop's pictures the original estimate and technician check out of vehicle on yelp.."}< /resp><Review>My soon to be stepdaughter needed to get her radiator fixed and a few other things. A couple weeks later, her ac went out. She took her car back, to see if possibly they did something while replacing the radiator (not saying intentionally). She was charged $50 to have the inspection. They gave a list of work that needed to be done to correct the problem... $1700 worth. We elected not to have them do the work. Instead, we decided to go to the dealership (chevy). They said it would be $1350. Do the math, $250 cheaper. Now, normally dealerships charge more, or at least that's the perception.
So ask myself why is it cheaper? Maybe this isn't the right answer but this is my opinion. They saw a young attractive lady that doesnt know anything at all about cars and tried to take advantage of her.
Please please, go somewhere else to have your work done.<//Review>< Pics>

Patrick (the owner), his family, and team have been doing mechanical work for me and my family for about 20-plus years now. I have also referred many friends and co-workers who have had the same positive experience. I have ALWAYS been pleased with not only their professionalism and quality mechanical work, but also their friendly, honest and personable service. He has a team of quality guys working with him and will get your job done well, quickly, and reasonably.  I highly recommend The Shop for your mechanical repairs.< /Review>

I started using The Shop for our automobile repairs a few years ago. I really like this place. The guys working the office are very friendly and knowledgeable. I have always been happy with the estimates and the quality of their work. They are a busy place, like most auto repair places, it is better to get there early.</Text>

Hard working and honest guys, that know what they are doing and don't try to overcharge you. I bring all my cars here for maintenance. Ray is a funny dude and can make you doubt a bit, with his snappy answers/comments  but once you know him he's a good guy!
Highly recommended!</Review>

<review>So disappointed. Took my SUV in for a leak on a Friday. They called that same day and said it would cost $199.00 to fix it. I said ok. They called me the same day and said it was fixed. I picked it up and went home. The next day I went to leave and it was still leaking!! I couldn’t get back in until Friday so I took it in on Friday morning they called and told me it was gonna be another $250.00 to fix it. I said ok and they called me that same day and said it was fixed. I went and picked it up and when I got home it was leaking WORSE!!! I took it back in on Monday morning and I didn’t get it back until Thursday. I will NEVER go back there.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c25c62b702e827:0xa8b9e3b70c77281b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Vince and Mike have both been awesome as well as the mechanic (did not catch his name) that has been working on my 83 Chevy c20 p/u (diesel). The vehicle was my great grandfather that's now been passed down to me.  That being said, the vehicle has sat for 20+ yrs and many parts need changing,  cleaning,  etc. My batteries and keeping the truck going was always an issue (being stuck with a dead vehicle after work is no fun after the 10th time) so I finally brought it to Vince, explained to him everything that had been going on. Dying batteries, glow plugs failing, as well as no alternator belt.  They were able to fix all the problems and replace all the parts for a cheap price as well as even let me know that my batteries were never the issue for why I was always stuck. Replacing the starter and a new set of batteries I have yet to break down on the road.  I couldn't have been happier and satisfied to see my grandfather old work truck finally being restored.  Thanks everybody at The Shop you guys are too awesome and I'll be in soon for that steering box! god bless!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>About a month  ago my wife was coming home from a photo shoot for a Motorcycle Manufacturer and her Mercedes just lost power. she called to ask me to call a tow truck, but for some reason it would be an hour + wait before the tow truck could get to her.
I was not going to have her sitting on the side of the road for that long, I decided to start calling some shops in the area and found a place called "the shop"  I spoke to a Gentlemen by the name of Ray this man went above and beyond. He said he does not do road service but would make an exception. within 15 minutes of me hanging up the phone he had his tech out to where my wife's car was broken down and within 45 minutes had her back on the road.The funniest thing was that he did not charge me a dime. I would recommend "the shop" to anyone who wants an honest shop working on there car.<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I had my flexplate and starter replaced my this shop on my 1995 chevrolet diesel 6.5 turbo. I've put less than 10,000 miles in the past 2 years on it. The starter failed recently from the nose breaking. Come to find out they never correctly installed the starter as there is a third bracket that was completely missing from the bracket! The bolts on the starter were also not the correct ones. Would not trust a shop that does not know how to properly install a starter on a very common truck. Flexplate is also needed to be replace as well now. Hopefully my block was not cracked as I have found can happen without the third bracket on the starter. Thanks Shop Quartz Hill!</Review>< pics>

Sounds like someone has a personal and emotional Issue to want to throw a group of people under the bus without mention of reason or cause. As to your comment about the sell of the business, Everyone has choices about entering into contracts.

If a business entity suceed`s or fails, most of the time the reason is in the mirror.
This lesson is called life!

The Shop has a very personable and proffesional staff that I was fortunate to find.

Called in and asked about getting some fog lights wired and they were so rude. The guy told me I'm not going to do it at all for you and hung up on me. Worst customer service ever, I'll never take my car here.</review>

<text>Wow just got off the phone with one of the guys at the shop. I was expecting helpful and nice according to all the reviews. Cocky and wanted to talk over me when I was trying to explain what was going on with my truck. Only positve is he wad very full of his buisness and how popular they are for small shop and point blank before I could even get a word out he was we cant help you today. Ok how about an appointment on Mon or Tues, his answer no, you can expect to wait hours. Mind you this was just asking for an oil change because of a possible stripped drain plug. Go figure.</text>< pics>

Most dishonest, cocky, disrespectful, group of individuals I've ever dealt with.  Do they think that the Quartz Hill residents wouldn't remember who these conmen really are, that we would just forget Ray Estrada and his twice as slimy, sidekick TOM and there 10+ years of taking advantage with there second rate work followed by extremly over priced cost. And lets not foget there final blow by selling the business at such an over priced amount to a individual in witch they new would surely fail. So I'm sorry but no I will not use them and my advice to you would be the same.<//Text>

If you haven't been you should go and check it out. The 15 min tour was definitely worth the time. The tour guide was very informative. And the gift shop had more then luffas and lot was made in house.</Review>

A local treasure. Our tour was detailed and very educational. Eric was friendly and answered all of our questions. They make all of the items in the store, and have quite a selection at a very fair price. I highly reccomend you get your luffa and education from here.<//Text>

Love this place.  It's a local gem. Make sure you do the tour and buy a lot of their items.  They have Luffas, Soaps, and hand sanitizera.< /text>

A truly amazing place to visit, so incredibly interesting, very informative!  You don't have to walk alot to see so much! There are so many interesting n adorable things to see! The "guide" that showed us around n told us about it was one of the nicest people I've ever met! There's a small gift shop with some incredible gift items, that are very reasonably priced! I've recommended visiting there to some people so far, but plan to suggest visiting there to almost everyone I come in contact with!< /Review>

Great place to take the kids and the grandparents it will amaze everyone no matter what age, very educational and informational, it's ran by a family and their close friends. It's the only us grower that is open to the public , they give tours and lunch ins, they make all nature bath and body products from natural herbs they grow right there on the farm and if your on the mesa stop by there and be amazed<//Review>

Great place to visit. We took the tour and it was AWESOME & very interesting. They have a small store where you can purchase the dried Luffa to use in your shower. It really feels good to the Luffa rather than your wash cloth. Stop by if you're in the area.< /Text>

I traveled with a group of 16 to SLO and a small group visited first. The remaining members of the group stopped by on the way out of town.
It is a free tour but a purchase is a must after learning how loofahs are grown. They are not from the sea!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80ec5d4ec5a55501:0x6cb6b772e286cbcb<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fun and interesting tour. Small farm with a hippie/ bohemian vibe. The sell luffas the grow along with soaps and lotion. They let my child try peeling the luffa. We went during a ridiculous heatwave(100) but it was still worth a 20 min stop.< /review>

We LOVE this place.  The people are always so friendly.  The tour is enlightening as to growth of loofa and the products are awesome.  Basically make special trips to the coast to 1) see the ocean and 2) restock my loofa supplies. 😀.  Well worth the few miles to reach the farm and another view of ocean a very short distance away!.<//review>

<Text>I went to the Luffa Ranch with my sister on  a weekend trip to visit because she lives in Pismo Beach. and when she found this great little Farm she has been bring people and family members ever sense. And when it was my turn to be a visitor , I was amazed . I spent over an HR. there and learned so very much about  plant that has so much to offer , and the history of the family business was even more amazing .... me and my 3 daughters loved the Gift shop.. and we came home with a face Luffa ans the Oils and soaps and lotions , And knew that we had something special... Now that we are back home in Bakersfield and it's been a few weeks.. ans enjoying our Luffa's , Me Especially as Mom and taking care of my Skin using only name brand scrubs and lotions put all that aside to use something from mother nature/ God's green goodness... and I cant believe how much more my skin has improved in texture and looks , I have been receiving word that i look 10 years younger .. the part that i love so much is that my make-up goes on better and looks way better and  lasts longer.. so now i'm using the Luffa all over my Body and getting the same effect on my Body that the lotions go deeper into my skin and last all day.. so now i have to go back and buy a body sized one so I'll have one just for my face ... The Family owned Farm is so beautiful .. and the wonderful smells and the out doors ... makes you feel like home and to just come and sit and hang out with food and a glass of wine ,,, Thank you Luffa Farm for giving me a new look and i do not have to spend tons of money on all that other stuff to have nice skin.. and yes i heard you can  use them for cleaning your house and things , mine is to special right now...and i only have to buy one every 9 months..</Text>< pics>

< Review>
Great place. I'm a local and decided to finally stop at the Luffa farm. It is very interesting to learn about the luffa (it looks a lot like a zucchini as it grows but then gets dark brown and dries up and that means the luffa is ready to harvest), staff is extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. The whole farm (5 acres with 3 green houses and some gardens) is very laid back and welcoming.  I got some homemade soaps and a luffa ready to use and it is awesome in the shower.  I also got a luffa to peel and it was fun peeling it to reveal my luffa inside.  I plan on going back for the holidays to get gifts  (Mother's Day, Christmas,  etc). The prices are reasonable,  the items are good quality,  and it's wonderful to support a local business.<//Review>

I haven't needed gas for three months due to the pandemic, but I buy cigarettes there occasionally. Last time the cashier was on break, so I used the 5 minutes of wait time to wash my car windows. The cashier's are akways great!< /review>

It blew my motor. They should not be giving advice that relates to things they know nothing about. All they know how to do is sell gas and cigarettes. Stick to that you ignorant morons:(

Great customer service and attend people quick. Even when they are backed up they call other store sites for people to come out to help their customers. Will definitely be coming back for insurance here!</Review>

Do not file your taxes here they advertised as 29 dollars in the end they will charge more than 100 for a simple form.  Plus some extra fees in total around 200.  I was a old customer and I had a good experience before but this year is so bad.< /text>

<Review>Biggest joke in humboldt county. I’ll never go again. They ask you to call them back every month to make an appointment and you can never get the appointment. They have major issues at this place. Plus the dentist are all brand new. They have splashed cleaning solution in my eyes, they killed my gums around my canine and they have overdosed me on the numbing agent because the guy couldn’t do a nerve block. I hate this place with a passion. There’s only one good dentist in that place and he doesn’t care about the patients anymore.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

The premier dental center in Humboldt county, so busy they often have to refer out or schedule pretty far in advance. If you're fortunate enough get in you'll be thrilled with the whole experience even and especially during the pandemic where you're greeted with mask, temperature taking, covid-19 screening & beepers so we could hang out all over burre center and surrounding areas. I haven't even addressed their staff and facilities. I adore dr rosas and can't believe she'll be finished with my replacement teeth including ordering bone grafts & implants to make sure<//Text>

<Text>I drove 1 1/2 hours for a 7:30 am appointment for my 7 year old to have her first cavity filled, she was scared and started crying and before I even had the chance to comfort her and calm her down (which she did) the dentist got up and walked out and they refused to fill her cavity. If you have children take them somewhere else they do not know how to speak to kids.<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is a joke, not only are the people at the front desk just plain rude, but it is impossible to get an appointment. I had a dental cleaning scheduled months ahead of time only to have them call me the day of my appointment saying they had to reschedule because the dentist “was sick”. That’s not a problem stuff happens but what blew my mind was the earliest next appointment they had was 6 months away, are you kidding? Don’t go here.</text>

I see that a lot of people had a negative experience here, I want to say that was not the case for me. I came here because I was desperate, and a broke college student attending HSU, my wisdom teeth had been coming in for years, but was finally becoming unbearable. I was seen by the dentist, I was given treatment, I was referred to a dental surgeon (if thats the correct terminology?) and maybe within 4-6 months my teeth were removed. Unfortunately the time frame was so long because that is just the way our health care works in america. I also had to drive 6 hours south to see the dental surgeon, as they were the nearest that would see me. (San Leandro)  But both of those facts are outside of their control. I wanted to thank this location for helping remove my teeth and fixing cavities as I had not seen a dentist in probably over 5-7 years.</Text>

When a child show any emotions of being upset they just walk away Instead of even trying to talk to your child and ease there worry. It's tramatic to some kids and at least try to talk to them instead of just walking away and making it worse.<//Text>

<text>My Daughter called to make an appointment and the lady that answered the phone was extremely rude and disrespectful.. what ever happened to good customer service .cuz apparently they don't enforce it at this facility.. She was then passed to the supervisor  who was also disrespectful... all my daughter was trying to do was get an appointment. She has been in excruciating pain ..I would not recommend this place to anyone.. they get a zero in my book.. they need to learn if not customer service e atleast to have some manners.. Very disappointed... they get a negative  zero.. Rude people< /text>< pics>

<rate>2</rate><review>Mixed bag and not a positive experience overall. Dentists seem to be nice and knowledgeable so on the actual procedural side I think they have an OK practice here. The problem really is more.admonistratice and availability. This is the only dental clinic in the area that can accept MediCal so naturally everyone in the region will come here to be seen. But they won't take new clients, period. You can have a standby appointment but that's it and in my experience they're not worth waiting for. I've waited 3 times and got seen once. The time I got seen they wouldn't operate they just assessed and then told me they'd help me with a problem area in my teeth but that I would need to reschedule for that operation. I was told that a new dentist was being brought in and the clinic would be willing to get me a appointment since my issue was pressing and more could be prioritized above a vast majority of patient operations and that instead of forcing me to take another standby they could make an exception and get me seen at a specific time. But that someone would call me and set that up. I got a call a couple days later and missed the call but responded to the voicemail when I finally got it and they wouldn't honor a set appointment and instead I would be required to do standby. A whole lotta good that did - I didn't get seen on that standby appointment and gave up on this place. I don't get how they can't offer a few appointments for non typical patients. I would have taken an appointment 3 weeks out just to know I have a set time. But no, can't have that. Instead I'm in need of a clean up of decay and a temporycrown and an eventual root canal (most likely) and I'm going to have to set aside a weekend to go to either Sacramento or Redding to get this taken care of which kind of defeats the point of having MediCal since the procedure will cost a few hundred bucks at least and that's what I'll be spending to blow a weekend elsewhere to get the work done that this clinic can do (at least some of it). If you're a new patient, don't bother unless you have several days you can waste sitting in their office hoping to be seen. If this office is getting funding (they are) for being able to take patients like me it would be nice if they can take them, even if it's just for a couple appointments a year. Beyond annoying that this is what we're stuck with. I can't buy dental insurance right now or I would and never deal with a place like this again. 2 stars only because they saw me once but nothing more because they didn't address the problem and went back on what they offered me in terms of a fixed appointment.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

After reading all these horrible reviews I was a little scared of going there.  Since I had a very good all-round experience, I would like to share it. It seems like people are more likely to write reviews when they had negative experiences. So from my first call at the clinic to the cavity/filling that got worked on, they did a great job. The staff was very kind and nice and the doctor (Dr. Moreno) was very kind and patient, explained every step of what she was doing and gave me space to ask questions or mention any concerns. I felt heard. And then she did a great job on doing the actual work on my tooth. Very professional. Furthermore, the establishment was clean and hygienic as it should be. (Ps. Pregnant women get appointments right away and both times I was there, I didn't even have to wait for 5 minutes)<//Review>

<Text>The staff was polite and professional. Received emergency treatment, I was told I would have to wait upon making appointment. I did not expect to get in and receive treatment. Yet, the wait was 45 min and the staff preformed xrays and extraction same day. 3 hours total time there.

<text>Incident #1: A few months ago I made an emergency appointment for a tooth that had been bothering me for over a year. When I got seen, the dentist (the woman who doesn't speak English very well) told me it was just that I needed to floss better and use mouthwash. I had been flossing regularly. About a month later I moved out of state and didn't have any insurance. I was in a ton of pain and had to take narcotics to avoid paying for an emergency root canal. I ended up having to pay close to $2000 out of pocket for a root canal. Thank you Burre Dental for your help.

Incident #2: Completely incompetent staff. I called a few months back to make an appointment and they tell me that they (like usual for this practice) need to make two appointments for what should only take one. I don't get it but go along with it. Then, when I show up, after taking my daughter out of school and taking my two year old with me, I'm told there's a mistake and she won't be seen. Thank you Burre dental center for completely wasting my time and gas. I think they only stay in business because there are no other options in Humboldt county for low income patients.< /text>< pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>In tough health care times Burre Dental provides essential care to the surrounding community - however, I had a HORRIBLE experience here. I was grateful to be seen as an Emergency Fit In appointment and the initial consultation went well. When I returned for the 2nd appointment I arrived early to check in. There was some fumbling with my paperwork as people began to pile up behind me. The woman helping me was told to set it to the side and I sat down with my crosswords and articles. I began to watch those in line with me that morning enter and leave. I waited patiently but growing concerned at approximately 2.5 hours I approached the counter. The woman behind the desk offered an explanation of their procedure and I sat down. Three of the original 10am check-in remained, including myself. Then two. I approached the counter again and was given a very catty explanation. I had asked a question but they didn't want to answer it. Instead procedure was repeated over and over. Perturbed I sat down. Just before the 4 hour mark I watched the last person called. Very concerned I approached the counter again. After dealing with an overwhelmingly rude woman I made an appointment for another day and left feeling very disturbed.
I called about a week later to inquire about the time of my next appointment. The woman on the phone said they had no record of one for me. When she pulled up my file.....she began reading....aloud....as people do out of habit. I was appalled at what was written about me on that chart. She stopped herself.....fumbled and said "maybe they thought you wouldn't show up so we never made it".
Days later.....the day before my appointment. I received a phone reminder about said appointment. Due to my work schedule I was unable to make it.
I believe it is highly probable that this was done on purpose...for what reason I have no idea.
I am a soft spoken, mannered individual  who works in customer service. In this experience, overall, I felt bullied and powerless.They made immoral assumptions about my person without any investigation into my well being.< /text><Name>Mo Yan</Name>< pics>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Every time I have taken my children to this clinic , they are late , unorganized and have the worst system I have ever come across in my 47 years. Mutiple visits for an exam and cleaning that could EASILY and should take place simultaneously. Examine & clean teeth every 6 months. Schedule the next appointment for 6 months when you leave. That’s NORMAL. This place has you come in for an “ exam”. Wait for 45-60 minutes for a 5 minutes glance . The. Schedule another appointment to clean the teeth. That’ll be another 2-3 months out. Then schedule another appointment for any work that needs to be done.
They also told us for two years to just keep working at a couple loose teeth that wouldn’t come out. “Bite a carrot “ was actual advice. Then we come back 3 months later, and they tell her they should have been pulled YEARS Ago. Now, she needs braces to pull down teeth that couldn’t come in because they wouldn’t remove the loose teeth.
If we had ANY OTHER CHOICE, we’d be there. Humboldt  needs to figure their clinics out ASAP</Review><time>1545237055627< /time><Resp>None< /Resp><user>104382597416378702713< /user><name>whende be</name></record></dataset><record>

The best dentists and staff ever! With how busy they are they really try and help. Novocain shots are virtually painless! Everyone is so competent and friendly! Just be patient and call early in the morning for cancelations and you'll be good as new in no time!<//Text>

<text>Worst help ever,
They made me feel less
I was telling them what was the problem and at the end they did whatever they want and I felt less because they are doctor and think they know more than myself, they took the wrong tooth out and I still have a root canal infection which still is getting worst. I still ask for an appointment again because pretty much is the only help I can get here and they say call tomorrow and hope to have some luck</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

While I received the care I needed and it was actually covered my MediCal, which was basically miraculous, the dentists I saw were in training still and had poor rapport with patients. They didn't seem to know how to relate to low-income people and tried to blame me for being too poor to see a dentist in the last seven years. They made me feel even worse than I already do about my bad teeth :(</review>

I had a real good experience with Burre Dental. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. I had a tooth removed and was put on a stand-by appointment, but didn't have to wait long at all. My recovery time was quick and painless, and I would defintely go back if I needed too!< /Review>

Based on the two times they were called upon by members of my household, I would not recommend wasting time here.

If you are desperate to save a few bucks, love to wait, and don't mind a few calls and trips, go for it.

Otherwise, find a care provider that has the time to care.

Their phone reps routinely tell people to piss off.

As with all things you get what you pay for and I guess since they don't take much for payment they don't intend to provide much for service.</Text>

<Text>Worst place *ever*. I broke a tooth & called for an appointment, was told they had one left at 7:45AM. I arrived there to have a snotty, ill-informed receptionist tell me that it was so I could wait to be seen *sometime* that DAY.  Was told I had to fill out a ton of forms & maybe my insurance would cover it even though when I made the "appointment" I was told my insurance would cover it. Save up your lunch money & go to a real dentist, it's worth it.<//Text>< Pictures>

The only thing I don't like is that I was supposed to be given a call yesterday about my dental work situation and I never got one, plus I've called yesterday and today which by this website states that this facilty is open til 5pm. I'm just wondering why I haven't heard word about my much needed dental work when one of the receptionists said the next day I'd be given a call so I could finally get a start on my dental care 😕 It's been a while since I've had my teeth looked at and this is the only place I know of to get help like this. It'd just be great for something about my teeth to finally be ttaken care of, that's all.<//text><Name>Justin Garner< /Name>< Rate>

They got me in quick ONCE for a temp filling, I seem to wait longer when I have an actual appointment..I have medi-cal and when I have an appointment scheduled it usually takes a 2 and a half hour wait to get me in after that. Dr. Wright is very rude, literally made me cry he made me feel so bad about myself. Trying to switch dentists as soon as possible!< /Review>

Sprayed that putple stuff on my teeth and made me go to the bathroom and brush 5 times after the 5th when i still had some on my back teeth gumline they told me if i was going to continue down the road to rot that im on there us nothing they can do to help me. Now all the teeth they worked on are broken and breaking off and infected....trrying to find somewhere else to go...</Review>

I am in shock at how little was done for me,I have a serious,quite agonizing tooth infection.the doctor,mr.wright told me to decide to redo my root canal,or have it removed,why was this up to me,when both options were described as dangerous?then I said I wanted antibiotics as it would be weeks till I could get to another city for dental work,there's nothing in arcata for the disabled poor,so it would be a greyhound ride for 5 hours to santa Rosa,and he denied my request,saying,when they cleaned out the decay,the pain would ease up! No antibiotics for a serious infection! So I can't be see till mid February,and my pain is not important,that the message from the burre center,and if I die from not being prescribed medication,while waiting weeks,it will be wrongful death caused by the negligence of this clinic!!!</text>

I'm really disappointed in the reviews that the Burre Center has gotten. A lot of these seem to be based on unfounded hearsay or written in a huff. I went into the place for the first time (emergency visit) and, guess what, I DIDN'T have a terrible experience!

The facility was clean and the staff was professional. (The young lady that helped me was extremely friendly, which was admirable since I got in around 2PM and she had been there since 6AM!)
Yes, there was a long wait once I got into the chair but, considering that this location is currently the ONLY DENTAL FACILITY WITHIN THE TRI-CITY AREA that ACCEPTS MEDI-CAL, the fact that they were able to process a newcomer like myself in the same day is impressive.
So, unless the other dentists in the area are willing to accept low-income insurance, Burre is going to be constantly inundated with Medi-Cal patients (re: they can't take on any new ones), as well as get the brunt of same-day emergencies. I commend them for that!!

***And if, for some reason, you want me to find a negative in my experience with Burre, here it is: Of all the people I talked to -- in person and over the phone -- there was probably one that seemed a little aggrieved. Even with all people they serve day-in and day-out, the only feedback that seems to get through are the ones complaining about their work. How shocking, it is, that they would feel defensive sometimes!***

So, tips for a better Burre experience:
1) Grab a book to read or a game to play for the wait;
2) Ask questions without demeaning the staff; and
3) Get over yourself!</Review>

Food way below average:  burn, hard sausage, old hard toast and a small amout of hash browns.  Just awful.
I will never go there again.  Absolutely a big disappointment.<//Text></record>

<Review>Small Mom & Pop since 1981. Great food and you can't beat the prices, $3-5 breakfast, I had steak, & eggs under 8 bucks and it was good. Friendly service from Miguel jr. 6 tables plus bar seating & 6 parking spots in old rustic building. I recommend you give it a try.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUJxnQ_s3p4hoAEsKOMTJSBE_NevkJVWydvLpi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBSrLrW3E7TSrL-OfoDNJKUr6pKrKJLEODQ76V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHfKEnyQx8HeDtFSXik-SFTk6Wc5kmeYWOGBJV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ5hfJO1Gp4U5w72vW6K2nk7ykY3op50T_plHO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDx5J1VioaZ4_Ee221KTRdtZCnJ9I8qWnYUwDw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDrDOVu63TRg7BsdvvQevOMLVczrmfNT666z4G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBLgt8fH7cGG2WzY8a2sG6Oya8UdL58WunFjY6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP80s6YBRFJ6ESRORj7MKX-3POMu6bHXaxS_Lcz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

Saw the positive reviews which seemed good, but I was not impressed, in side really smelled like old oil. We had ordered 2 of they're fish & chips sorry to say fries & fish were soggy! 1-Miguel burrito which was huge in size, wow!  After cutting into it, meat seemed old like it was cooked before sitting in a pot, not fresh dry over cooked. Did like the chile relleno plate! Was the best of all the dishes we ordered. I don't think we will be back to this restaurant, just felt like a waste of a good appetite!🙁</text>

I moved to Idaho two years ago and really miss this place. True homestyle food and great prices. My favorites were chorizo breakfast with beans and potatoes, menudo and even a cheeseburger and fries were delicious. Run by the nicest couple. A true mom and pop establishment. Nothing fancy but it always reminded me of the way things used to be. Like stepping back to simpler times.<//review>

<review>Wonderful family owned restaurant, interior could use some updating but that costs money that restaurants like this often don’t have, Great food, traditional Mexican cuisine, kind family, highly encourage anyone to try the place! Also note the prices here are AMAZING, honestly probably cheaper than cooking for the family to just go here and get some great food!< /review>< Pics>

Some folks like the type of coffee they have, I don't.  It tasted like it was old percolated type.
The biscuits & gravey were terrible.
There were remnants of grilled onions on everything.
The service was lacking.
The waitress was nice.
The cost was low.</Text>

Driving by looking for a place to grab a quick bite when we noticed Annie's building next to another old building. The food was very good, good portions, and incredibly inexpensive.  The woman who took our order and then cooked and served it. We are rarely in this town but we will go out of our way to come again. If they cater, I'd use them.< /Text>

<Review>My family, including my mom who has passed have loved Annie's for years. Mom's favorite was the Chili rellenos. We will be moving soon to Oregon, we will miss you Annie and all your wonderful food and smiles. Great food here and amazing prices. And I think you should raise the price of the food Annie, it's so worth it! The sauce on the enchiladas is to die for and the beans are so tasty and uniquely flavored. Thank you so much for all your great food and kindness. The Curran's and the Turner's love Annie's!<//Review>< pictures>

Have been going here for years. Love this place. Every single item on the menu is delicious. Chef Miguel and Sedronia who is the waitress, are very nice and hospitable people. The carnitas are especially delicious.</Text>

But that didn't deter us from trying the food.  We're sorry we went. The food was not good. The lettuce in the salad was wilted, the salad dressing was bottled, the mashed potatoes were instant, the Salisbury steak was ground beef with bell pepper, onion and gravy, and the cheese on the cheeseburger was a cheese food slice.  Nothing was fresh . We're scared what the rest of the night holds after eating this food. We will not be back .<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

The Best BLT I've every had food is awesome .. it's a old buliding and very small . It's very old school . Family owned and they do serve beer .. we were out in California for a month and Vegas , this place had the best food for our entire trip.. Promise .. now understand this isn't a 5 star restaurant so if your thinking this is and expect to be wined and dined .. don't .. it's a local place with a heart of making simply dishes with a warm taste good feel.. loved it and also know I'f you are to good for a regular people establishement , This is not for you.. this is old school all day.. the wait staff are lovely . We will always stop in on our returns to suncity California..<//Text>

Feel like im in my grandma's house :) the food is awesome! Chorizo and eggs or the huevos rancheros are on point. Came back from Phoenix on the weekends and always stopped in for my plate. Great elder couple running it. I dig the interior, nothing is a front or fake, It's old and worn down but feels cozy. Love this place.  (38 y.o. vet)</Review>

<review>Been ordering my cakes and cupcakes for 10 years now and they're always delicious and custom made to match my event theme but this last time was the best. I ordered candles online and took them in to see if they can match the colors however the lady that was working came out and started giving me ideas, she went to the back and had the Wonder Woman toppers ready, we got chocolate cake filled with strawberry and decorated with buttercream frosting. Thank you for making my little ones birthday even better we all loved the cake!< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
I love food 4 less..great customer service and super low prices. I was there earlier and I bought some keurig coffee, I guess they where stocked on the wrong spot for a low price.. When i got to the register of course it scanned the correct price but the night manager honored the lower price. I know its not a big deal to some people, but it was for me so thank you Eric and all f4l employees for always being fast, fun and friendly :)<//Review>

<review>They don't have everything you want but the shoppers are great and the staff are outstanding. Shopped here for 16 years. They also have a gas station. If you spend over $100 using the card they give you get 10 cents off a gallon of gas. Love the managers I've come to know. Wish they had more flavor choices in Powerade and Gatorade. .<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I like shopping at the Food 4 Less on Alessandro better because I know where everything is and they are always fully stocked and the produce is better and they have a better bakery department. But I like going to this gas station better than the other one cuz this one is less crowded and you can get in and out more easily.< /Text>< Pictures>

I suppose the gas attendant needed that dollar she stole from me more than I did.  I normally never pay for gas with cash and I never will again at this station as the attendant was given $23, which I counted out, one $20 dollar bill and three singles. I then proceeded to pump my gas that stopped at $22 at the pump.. when confronted she denied that I had given her the exact amount I did. Smh... absolutely ridiculous.  Not sure her name, should have gotten that... this happened today Tuesday 9/24/19 at approximately 1pm.  It’s not the dollar it’s the principle, I hate a liar and a cheat.</text>

the employees are so rude! especially a few minutes to closing time.  There are a few that are great, like the tall guy that straightened his hair, he's awesome, so is the assistant manager Lynn , and the tall Mexican girl with like curly hair and the short older Mexican lady, she has fantastic customer service. The rest of them can use a refresher course on how to treat the customers .</Text>

Has everything I need, clean, prices are right. Some of the cashiers do need an adjustment in attitude, but I just avoid them. They have a good choice for last minute birthday cakes. Very fresh & tasty too.</review>

I just got back from visiting family yesterday and Tuesday before I left, I visited this Food 4 Less to get some snacks for the way home. I was greeted by Brittnie who was very friendly! She knew where everything was and yet she told me she had just started the day before! Next time I go visit my relatives, I will be sure to visit this Food 4 Less again because the staff is amazingly friendly and care about the customers needs! 10/10 would go again!</Review>

Best part about this location is their gas station. Prices as low as Sams Club or Cost Co. with no membership required for gas.</Review>

This is a bag your own place. And now that they DON'T give plastic bag the counters were they were have large counter holes so your bages fall into them. Common now fix the problem. Update the bagging counters.</Text>

Well if you have a express lane for 15 items or less why would you check somebody out that has over 50 items? Plus if you have 10 people to each line why in the world would you have 3 lanes open? This store has gone downhill. I now shop at WinCo. I just needed a couple things so I stopped in here.... Never again!< /text>

I actually in general like this store quite a bit. I live so close, Im there sometimes 5 days a week.  Great prices, pretty good ethnic food selection, as well as organic foods. My only complaint is a COUPLE cashiers. Normally I wouldnt let two or three cashiers affect my rating of a store, but their customer service is that bad. Most of the cashiers I love, helpful, relatable, & just overall friendly. But theres several cashiers that are in the wrong job. Those never greet anyone coming thru their line, no hello, how are u?, eye contact, nothing. And act almost annoyed theyre doing their job. I cant stand when I encounter that. I vant imagine im rhe only person who notices it.<//Review>

I had a very unpleasant and uncomfortable experience at the food 4 less on Perris in Moreno Valley. I have been coming to this store for years and never have I felt sodisrespected. Shopping on Thursday night May 21st my fiancé and I came to the express lane to check out and as we approached the cashier and as we were unloading our items she stopped us with a nasty face expression and a sound of annoyance she told us "oh, no uh no you got dog food. Go to the other line." With the same rude expression.  She had no one in her lane. And we were next. It was extremely rude, embarrassing, and unprofessional. My fiancé works at a market himself and would never allow that type of treatment and in a means of prejudice. The other cashier looked shocked by her comments and reaction, he checked us out without a problem. I will never return to that store again and I will make sure everyone knows just how rude DORIS the cashier was. She should NOT be working in customer service. We needed our groceries otherwise we would of left our items in her lane just to spite her. But we tried to show more class and dignity than what she showed us. I just hope this doesn't represent the rest of the company if they're allowed to treat paying customers in this manner.< /review>

They have good pricess at the grocery store and the gas station, but you'll often find someone hitting you up for money at the gas station and the parking lot for the grocery store is not very well lit at night.</review>

As a grocery store it gets the job done with a decent selection and low prices, but the parking lot is really sketchy at night and the security guard himself looks pretty sketchy, I mean for an in and out pick up one thing store it isn't so bad, but it could be done much better.</review>

<text>Upon arrival someone greeted me in less than a minute.  My assigned service manager, Brian soon followed to verify work to be done and showed me the way to the comfortable waiting area and arranged a loaner since my recall service would take most of the day.  He called with an update on schedule and everything went smoothly.  Well done Frank Subaru</text>< pictures>

They were a bit busy and even though I showed up early to my appointment they let me know it was going to be an hour to hour and a half to do my routine maintenance. We ended up being there for about 1.5-2 hours.
Brought my dog with me and we were able to just hang out in the little dog run area (about the side of 1.5 parking spaces, short turf, water hose, and poop bag station). We brought a ball so we were able to keep my girl entertained for most of the time. One of the custodians was super sweet and brought over some goodies for my dog while we were out there and gave her a squeaky toy on the way out after they were done with my car.<//text>< rate>

<text>This is our third Subaru Forester that we've leased from Frank... Marco Vazquez takes amazing care of us every time, which is why we keep coming back. We actually live less than two miles from another dealership but always go to Frank instead (even though it farther away) because of the amazing customer service!</text>< pictures>

Frank did a solid job of changing my oil and checking tires, brakes, fluid etc on my Outback.  I had an appointment and was at the dealer about an hour, nice enough waiting area.. They missed some detail opportunities - a bunch of residue from the old oil change reminder sticker was left on the windshield and I had to scrape it off myself; my car wasn't washed, which is a simple but appreciated effort and something I got used to at my last dealer.  I bought my car at Frank and this was my first service experience with them.  I live in Clairemont and they are in National City and I am considering looking for a dealer closer to home.....</Text>

We recently purchased a 2019 Outback and couldn't be happier with the process. Isabella and the rest of the team answered all of our questions and worked with us to ensure a great rate. Absolutely recommend if you're in the market for a Subaru.<//review>

I just wanted to give Albert & Jose (and the beautiful receptionist)  a big shout out for the great experience in purchasing my vehicle. I came in on 4/24/21 after emailing Albert back and forth the previous night. Their friendliness and eagerness to help me get into my “new” SUV, along with their willingness to get me rolling with $0 money down, was nothing short of spectacular. Great customer service and sales team at Frank Subaru! Not only was I in & out in 2 hours, I was treated with courtesy and respect (something that certain other dealerships fail to give).
Thanks again to Albert & Jose.<//Text>

Frank’s Subaru was awesome. They helped me from Internet inquiries, select exactly what I wanted,  through the buying process. Helping me save and not up selling. and after it was bought with help with all the tech involved. Special kudos to Francisco.</Review>

<Text>Thank you Frank Subaru! Although, I went through a private broker, Frank Subaru went above and beyond to have the vehicle delivered to me, on the date and time I wanted, in Hollywood of all places. Amazing! The 2 gentlemen who delivered the vehicle, Jim and Mike were, not only down to Earth, but they explained all the features the vehicle came with to the tee. Highly recommend!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I chose to buy a new Subaru from Frank because of the dealership photos, map views and comments on Google maps. Frank Subaru in National City had the least one star reviews of any dealership I researched and I looked at many and not just Subaru dealers. Truly amazing accomplishment seeing the way people like to complain and how easy it is to do.
I could go on for hours how easy, fast, and pleasant the buying experience was. Fill out the forms and get a quick no bs quote. I filled out the credit application at 4 pm one evening and they delivered my awesome new Subaru Forester at 10:30 am the next morning. I watched at least 20 YouTube videos of professional driver’s reviewing the car and ride quality so I was not worried about not having a test ride. My socially distanced buying experience could not have been better and we love our new Subaru.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Great service.  With the sophistication of today's vehicles, it makes sense to bring it to the experts.  Frank's service department has not steered me wrong and my six-year old vehicle is top performance.</Review>

Overall, I have been very happy with the service at Frank Subaru.
I was alerted to a leaking strut and I'm working on resolving the issue.  This has taken place at 30,000 miles and sounds like it's not normal.  I have a case number established but progress is slow and getting the problem solved.< /text>

Purchased a Subaru Forester from this auto dealer using the Costco program. From start to finish the process was pleasant. No hassling, and we felt like we got a fair deal. This dealership did what they said they were going to do when they said they were going to do it. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again.</Review>

<username>Brent Alardia<//username><text>Im very pleased with the service I’ve received since using Frank Subaru to take care of the usual maintenance and repairs on my vehicle. I’ve recently moved from Colorado to San Diego and Frank Subaru has by far shown exceptional customer and vehicle care/service. Victor in the service department has been awesome from checking in my vehicle and with regards to communication throughout the process and puts me at ease knowing my vehicle is in good hands.

Great to know that there is a dealer we can trust and knowing my vehicle is in good care when needed.<//text>< user_id>

My Outback, with only 30,000 miles, developed a leaky strut. I thought this was unusual so I  contacted the main office. They agreed to fix it free of charge. Subaru comes through again.🙂👍🎉< /review>

Jacob was very helpful, courteous, and cute. He was a gentleman and a scholar. Also would like to mention he has some tasty looking peaches, I didn't have any, but I gave them a pinch just to see if they were as good as they looked, but I did have some coffee in the waiting area. The repairs on my car were performed fast and in a timely manner and correctly. Thank you for all your help Jacob.</Review>

Very disappointed with the way Juan Diaz processed our son's first major purchase. All broken promises, lack of sincerity  empty words and poor customer service. The used car my son wanted was displayed, but little did we know, there's a number of dents and damaged on the car's body. When we pointed it out, Juan said, "it's an easy fix and I will personally follow it up and you can pick it up by next week." We closed the deal on April 30, 2021 and just pick up the car today, May 12, 2021. Also, on the day we came to pick up the car home, my husband opened the car and got upset to see  so dusty inside. A prestigious car dealer never displays and sell dented/damaged cars and will let the customer bring home a clean car.< /Review>

My experience with Frank's subaru was very pleasant. I worked with Brian in the service department he kept me updated about my airbag recall replacement. When he told me he was going to call with an update he did. Man of his word . These are the small things I appreciate. There was a problem with the bracket after the replacement airbag went it he call immediately with an update and not to worry because it would be covered. Them assigning me a rental car for the time my car was in the shop was very helpful. This experience overall is 10 stars. Thank you again Brian for your professionalism and outstanding customer service.</Review>

I was looking for a great deal on a great car and I found it here at Frank Subaru. I had been looking at a couple different makes and models at dealerships across SD county but did not find the right deal till I stopped at Frank Subaru and spoke with Francisco. Right away I knew this was the place for me.  Francisco was courteous, knowledgeable and eager to please. We settled on a great price and a great rate very quickly! We used our Costco Executive membership to obtain some additional incentives. They had the Share the Love Event going on which was great Subaru made a donation on our behalf to help Meals on Wheels and the ASPCA. We purchased an extended warranty that comes straight from Subaru at a great price! Ended up driving home in a beautiful Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid! Go see Francisco he won’t disappoint. I’m a very happy customer!</Review>

<Text>My wife and I came to Frank Subaru looking for a specific vehicle and were immediately greeted by one of your sales people (Mathieu Pelletier.) Matt was FANTASTIC in the way he heard what it was that we wanted and found us the vehicle that we had hoped we would get. He was kind and attentive while keeping on brand. We drove off with the car we wanted, the price we wanted to pay, the trade-in we wanted and a fantastic rate!! I will HIGHLY recommend him to any of my friends or colleagues who may be in the market for a new car! Please take the time to recognize Matt and incentivize his efforts and salesmanship. Thanks again to everyone at Frank Subaru.</Text>< pictures>

Just wanted to take this time to thank everyone at Frank Subaru for helping me keep my ride!! I got a beautiful WRX from them 3 years ago and placed it on a lease to check it out. Turns out it was the car for me and once my lease was up, I had trouble keeping it cause of my credit. My credit wasn’t too bad actually, and Manny and his team took the time to help me find a lender. It wasn’t long until I got the approval and I was so happy!! This car has helped me with my everyday life and Frank Subaru helped me keep it!! Thanks to everyone at Frank Subaru!! You guys are THE BEST!!</Text>

<Text>I was greeted  pleasantly when I arrived even though it was earlier than appointed  and everyone was very helpful. The service department was efficient and completed the work on my car so quickly that I was able to get back on the road without feeling that the morning was “wasted”.  The area for clients to wait had been prepared for the important social distancing necessary for COVID-19 safety and was frequently wiped down between users. I’m  so glad that I chose this car and a dealership that clearly cares and has its act together< /Text>< pictures>

Frank Subaru was great to work with. Jose Cortez was amazing and walked me through the car and provided me with a great test driving experience and there was no pressure to buy at that point. A few days later I came back to make the purchase, and Jose was great and took me through the process. I met with Jackie Gutierrez to sign the contracts and get the financing in place, and she was wonderful to deal with. Denise Rivera helped me through the purchase as their Costco Auto Program representative.

I also was able to schedule a service appointment the same day with John Loss in the Service Department to have door moldings installed.  The Service Department estimated that the the installation would take 1 1/2 to 2 hours, and they were done in just over 1 hour.  The work was beautiful.</review>

<text>Frank Subaru made the car buying process super seamless and smooth . The salesman helping us, Manny, made the whole experience very easy, he was extremely helpful in answering any and all of our questions (no matter how silly they were), he was very detailed in walking us through the whole process. He provided exceptional customer service, has great product knowledge, even at closing time he offered to walk us through the different apps for the car, he offered to help set up the phone with the car; he went above and beyond to make sure we were all set to drive off as satisfied customers. Manny also informed us about all of the different charities that Frank Subaru is partnering with and how they give back to the community which is really important to us for brand loyalty.

They also made the process very COVID friendly,  all of the staff I saw were constantly sanitizing their areas. We had an appointment and the car was ready at the front early, solo test driving,  etc. All and all wonderful experience! Thank you Manny & the Frank Subaru Team!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Very good customer service. The techs are well trained and are very efficient. Phone calls are made regularly to be updated and the service department is the best I've ever experienced from any dealer. They are thorough and listen to everything u may have a concern about. They offer great recommendations and never push anyone to recieve a service they do not need or want (even if it means saving your cars life) they are kind courteous, respectful and compassionate of your beloved Subaru.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1556131769151, 'text': 'Thanks for the 5 stars!'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35<//GmapID></record>

We bought a new Subaru Forester Sport after months of thinking about it. We picked Frank Subaru in National City because of the price listed online. So no experience with this car dealership before, just going on price. My husband and I are so happy we took a chance. Manny Lord was the person who helped buy our new Subaru. He was polite, funny and very knowledgeable about the models we were interested in. He patiently set up two test drives and all the paperwork. Because of covid Manny did not accompany us on the test drives. This was great as we wanted to keep ourselves safe and also those that work at the dealership. Everyone (customers and employees) also wore masks within the dealership. We will refer family and friends to shop at Frank Subaru. Thank you for a great car buying experience. The Davidson Family.</Review>

I have been coming here for the last 2 1/2 years. All the service reps have been great, I’ve had the pleasure of having each one of them help me. Most recently I reluctantly agreed to the 60k service. I am not the most proactive in my car care, but thankfully went forward with the service, Brian was my service provider. He was able to also find an exhaust leak that was under warranty. Mostly, I am grateful that they provide you a vehicle during long vehicle maintenance, it allows me to continue my regular day to day. I feel much more confident in my cars long term health utilizing Frank Subaru.<//Review>

<text>Had a great experience. This is the second Subaru we have purchased from Frank Subaru and from Sales, Finance to Service we have had a pleasant experience.  We greatly enjoyed working with Jake Smith,  no relation.  He is well versed in product details,  communicates well and made the process enjoyable. We didn’t even consider shopping around.  They have good selection and professional staff.  We’ll be back.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1600883950175, 'text': 'Congrats on your new Subaru and welcome to the Frank Subaru Family.

Customer service is always great. Repairs are done when they say they will be, and if they can’t, they communicate well. Never any hidden or extra costs they aren’t clear on, and they let you know what will be recommended at future dates, as well as the cost and reason, ahead of time. As a side note, I’ve seen more women at this dealership, on both the repair and service sides, than any I’ve ever been in before, and it is great to see a balanced, diverse staff. They’ve also never made me feel pandered time, or talked down to me, because I’m a woman.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Jake, and the team at Frank Subaru made my first car leasing experience seamless and fun!  As a first time car shopper I was nervous and I had A LOT of questions.  From the start Jake was so helpful and happy to make sure that I got exactly what I wanted in a car.  He was so patient and answered my questions thoroughly.  I test drove multiple vehicles before finding the one I ended up driving off the lot with.

I had been to other dealerships prior to finding Frank Subaru, those experiences were not awesome.   I learned later that Frank is family owned. The difference was clear. At Frank, I felt completely comfortable. I never felt I would be taken advantage of. I could tell that everyone I worked with took pride in their job and the dealership.

I highly recommend Frank Subaru!  I've since had a friend purchase a car from them and she also had a wonderful experience.

Make sure you ask for Jake!< /text>< user_name>

Frank Subaru staff took care of us from the moment we scheduled our service appointment to the moment we drove off.

My Subaru recently underwent some warranty work and my service advisor John Loss was exceptional to work with. He kept me in the loop whenever he had an update to share and ensured a very quick turn around.

We received a loaner car as part of the service and my wife was rear ended on the freeway. The car wasn’t drivable anymore and we were moved into another car to  finish the time out.

Amazing customer service and friendliness!<//text>

Also appreciated the additional recommendations which were a great value and save me money and time.

I was also impressed by the short time it took to complete my service I was in-and-out of the dealership within an hour that was the 1st.</review><Time>1603384457896<//Time><Name>AJ Eric Smith< /Name>< user_id>

<text>I went into Frank Subaru unsure if I would be able to get a new car. The team at Subaru that helped me Moses, Juan, and Jackie were wonderful. They were friendly, helpful, accommodating, thoughtful and made my purchase possible. They make the process of purchasing a car fun and not stressful at all. Best of all I was able to leave with a good deal in my brand new car. I will definitely be recommending Frank Subaru and returning for future services. Keep up the great  service, it does not go unnoticed!<//text></record></dataset><record>

We bought our 2019 Subaru Outback here in May 2019 through the COSTCO car buying program and it was a quick, easy , pleasant experience. No haggling, and we got a great price on our car with a 10 year + 10,000 mi warranty. Whenever we need a routine service appointment it is easy to schedule, and their lobby is a clean, comfortable place to wait with charging stations, free wi-wi, a dog parklett, and free coffee. I had car trouble this week in the heatwave and they squeezed me in, provided me with a loaner car,  ran a a complete diagnostic, and when nothing came up, looked through everything a second time. We feel taken care of by them, and as a woman, I never feel condescended to when I'm there. I would absolutely recommend Frank Subaru to anyone looking to buy a new car.</review>

The owner sure does have in my opinion the best team on the mile. I wish I could of given you six starts. I'd ask anyone who is looking to purchase a vehicle to go here first. These dealership took care of us, thanks again 👍</Text>

So took my 2018 Forrester for some type of recall regarding the airbag on November 18 2020 during my visit I asked them that they please inspect the alignment. Service advisor indicated that I have one free alignment. . So unsurprisingly the alignment on the driver side front was off and they had adjusted it. I bring in my Forester in early January of 2021 for some other warranty work. Frank Subaru indicated that my alignment is off on both front wheels Frank wanted to charge me to fix the alignment this time. So please explain to me how it is that between Mid November until early January my front suspension was misaligned this time on both front wheels and you want to charge me. One star Frankie boy. Stay away from the Frank Subaru “stealership”.</Text>
<response>{'time': 1606240254760, 'text': 'Hello JB,\nThank you for taking the time to write your review. I reviewed you file, and had a look at your alignment reports (you were given copies) and the our alignment reports showed in November that all was as you stated. When you came in on January the alignment check showed that both front wheels were misaligned. You declined the work. These alignment checks are very accurate, and cannot be altered.  There are many ways for a car to get out of alignment, hitting potholes, curbing wheels, off road driving to mention a few. Hope this helps you clear this up.\n\nWe wish you safe an happy driving.\n\nBest Regards,\nMichael Wilkes\nGeneral Manager\nFrank Subaru'}<//response><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Seat Belt alarm horrible none stop, only the driver seat is electric why, no automatic trunk opener, back windows are not auto, radio sound no good, very complicated cruse control to many unnecessary features miles per gallon not very good, get foggy very easy, drives like a boat, bad choice. Won't buy another one.< /Text>

<Text>I’ve had nothing but 10/10 experiences at Frank Subaru. Nick F., Moses E., and Jacqueline G. were nothing short of amazing, and I’m thankful for their patience and help. I ended up not being able to part with my current Subaru, but once I’m ready to trade up I’ll be reaching back out to them. Truly exceptional customer service on their part.< /Text>< Pictures>

What an absolutely wonderful experience! I've never felt more comfortable at a dealership. We never felt pressured or like we were being conned like we've felt at other dealerships in the past. Manny was our salesman and he was honest, open, and patient with us. We ended up getting a good deal on a 2020 Subaru Outback Premium. I absolutely love our new car.</Text>

<Review>It is such a great relief to find a professional and trustworthy car service center. I rarely write reviews but feel the need to give due recognition and credit to Catherine Tozier, the representative who attended to me. I was really impressed by the technical competence, friendly approach, and ability to spend time explaining procedures that need to be done to rectify the problem, with a minimal charge (easy to fit within my budget). My car has always been treated with best care and the service I have received has been thorough and efficient. I am usually not this exuberant with my praise, but I am absolutely sure that this establishment deserves it, especially Catherine, for the professionalism and great customer service experience. I would highly recommend this service center for any of your auto maintenance.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1597679899006, 'text': 'Thank you for the outstanding review and great feedback.

<review>My 2019 Subaru Forrester suddenly gave a tire pressure warning light and I saw an in equality in the pressures,  but it was on Friday evening and I could not do anything about it.  So on Saturday morning  At 1100, I called Frank’s  service department to ask them if they would  check it and fill the tires.  They  worked me in very quickly at 1200.  They could not find any holes in the tires but did find a nail Stuck in the tread.  They worked on it for about an hour,  tires were fine and there was no charge.  It was great service! They really know how to take care of their customers.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

REVIEW UPDATE:
After learning of our initial experience, Frank Subaru General Manager, Michael Wilkes reached out to us to apologize for our experience, to explain exactly what had happened and to offer to come to an agreement amenable to both parties.  He worked expeditiously on the sale and communicated consistently throughout the process.
We leased a new 2021 Crosstrek today and the experience was great. Francisco Corral was very professional in finalizing the remainder of the deal and Jacqueline Gutierrez was top notch in the financing process.
We had a rough start but a great finish at Frank Subaru. Their concern regarding our initial experience led them to go the extra mile in making the overall experience a good one.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
At Frank Subaru their motto should be “Sorry, mistakes happen”.  Last week, my husband had the following experience:
I met with Sales and Leasing Associate Manny Lord after speaking with Sales Associate Denise Rivera on the phone. We arrived at an agreed upon price, upon which he presented me the offer in writing. I texted him the following day to confirm the price was still good and he agreed that was the “out the door price”. Upon agreeing on the price, I stopped working with another dealership on a deal, removed all of my personal items form my lease return and had it detailed. On the same day I returned to Frank Subaru. The hour and a half process continued all the way through them pulling my (excellent) credit report before Sales Manager Truman Berg informed me “sorry, mistakes happen”. Basically the price we gave you in writing was wrong. We had you sit here for hours, pulled your credit report but we are unable to honor our agreed upon price. When Truman contacted the Store Manager, he reportedly replied “tell him sorry, mistakes happen”. When Truman asked me “what do you want me to do” I replied “honor our agreement”. He replied “I can’t do that. Sorry mistakes happen”. Save yourself some time and shop somewhere that doesn’t have the motto “sorry, mistakes happen”.</text>

< Review>
I had a great experience at Frank Subaru. The experience was mostly due to salesperson Jake Smith. I was shopping for a Subaru at multiple locations in the San Diego area. The minute I arrived at Frank Subaru, there was someone there to greet me. That is great service. That person was Jake Smith. He was very helpful and answered all my questions. I was looking to buy a used car and walked away with a new car once Jake Smith informed me of the opportunities that were available when purchasing a manual transmission Crosstrek. I did not have a very good experience at Kearny Mesa Subaru nor El Cajon so you can bet that I will be back to Frank Subaru National City and will be talking highly of Jake Smith and the rest of your team.</Review>

I continue to come here from Rancho Bernardo even though there’s a closer Subaru dealership in Kearny Mesa because I love Frank Subaru where I bought my car. They are always so courteous, prompt and do good work. Their waiting room is large, beautiful with comfortable chairs.  They provide first class service.<//Review>

<time>1613938585047< /time><rate>3< /rate><text>Hi Frank Subaru: I'll like to leave you a review about my experience purchasing the 2017 Subaru Outback twillight blue metallic. Jose Cortez received us with a smile and very nice personality, He did show us the Subaru and ask for our ID's in order to test drive it. Everything was wonderful about this car with an exception of 2 large dents in the roof by the rear door and 3 or 4 scuff marks on the side doors. I didn't check the roof until I was home that afternoon, l called Jose and report this large dents and the scuff marks, he told me that this particular 2017 Subaru Outback it was already lowered in price and that they can not do nothing about this dents and scuff marks because they don't have a body shop.
I do not understand how come a large Subarus dealer as Frank Subaru doesn't have a body shop available. The other negative item was when we sign up for a maintenance service for our Subaru that we purchased with Alex for 750.00 dlls more or less. Alex called next day saying that this contract was not authorized by the dealer because of the mileage in our Subaru Outback. 51,000 miles. He called us to go back again to the dealership to sign again the contract without the maintenance service. Why are you offering such a contracts if you're not going to authorize??? Thank you for your attention to this matter and have a great day.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1614116286461, 'text': 'Hello Jose, Thank you for taking the time to write your review.

Do not get your oil changed here! I went to get my oil changed last week. The day after I had smoke billowing out of my engine. Four hours later, I was able to get my car towed to Franks and get a loaner car. I found out the next day that they forgot to put the cap back on and oil had sprayed all over my engine. Luckily, not enough oil had splattered to have permanently damaged my car or myself. All they had to say was "sorry and the manager is aware of what happened". The service advisor that helped me was polite and helped as best he could. I used to work in customer service, and if this had happened to a customer of mine I would have made sure to have management talk to them and remediate the situation some how. Stay away!< /Text>

Not only that, he went above and beyond when he offered to drive our newly bought car to our home for us so we wouldn't have to pay for a Lyft. Bonus, they are dog friendly and even have a small dog park for potty breaks.

I went to get a recall airbag service.  They gave me a brand new Subaru Forester Sport for as a “loaner”. I had only to pay for gas I used.  They also thoroughly checked my vehicle for needed repairs. I will do these o e step at a time... it was good to know!< /Text>

Frank Subaru is the best dealership in San Diego! I drive from north county just so I can get my car serviced at their location. Just a few days ago, I went to the shop for a routine service on my new Subaru. I also asked about a particular part that seemed to be aging more rapidly than normal. The part only costs $60 but the labor would be $600. Victor, my awesome service representative checked it out and unfortunately it would not be covered by the warrantee that I purchased. He encouraged me to reach out to Subaru of America and explain the situation. To my surprise, they had a rapid response time and reached to to Frank Subaru directly to come up with a solution. By the very next day, Victor called me and scheduled an appointment for me to get the part replaced free of charge! I was so surprised. Subaru of America and Frank Subaru worked out all the details, and I will even have a loaner car while the part is being fixed. This is my first Subaru vehicle and the company has definitely won my heart! Thank you Frank Subaru for being the best in the business :)< /Text>

We arrived and helped immediately. The service representative was efficient and let us know everything that needed to be done and costs before we left. He told us the service would take about 1 1/2 hours and he called within an hour with updates and time we could come back to get the car. They are trustworthy and efficient!</text>

I will only be taking my car to you from now on. You really do stand-out as exceptional after almost 35 years of car service experiences.

I have been in contact with them
for about a month before i came back from overseas. They were very informative and very helpful when it comes to my needs.
When the car i wanted got sold out, they didn’t give up from finding another one.

They gave me a good deal of the Car and got the car i wanted.
Though, when it comes to the features of the car (Starlink) they said something that was not available of the car, it was not a big deal since i never wanted those features anyway.

But overall, they helped me out getting a good deal, and got better offers when it comes to discounts and prices</Text>

<Review>I had a great experience buying my new 2020 Forester at Frank Subaru. I came all the way from Riverside County to buy at Frank Subaru  because of the great experience I had dealing with the salesperson on the phone.  Frank Subaru is all about great  customer service, and no BS games.<//Review>< Pics>

Great purchase experience with Robert, Jose and Edith at Frank Subaru. First time buying a Subaru and the whole experience was efficient and quick. They were very friendly and customer oriented. Got a great deal and very pleased with the overall experience. Highly recommend to anyone looking to purchase a Subaru in San Diego County.

And thank you to the entire Frank Subaru staff for making my son’s graduation surprise gift (Subaru WRX) a special moment during this uneventful class of 2020 school year.<//text>

Buying a car can be an exhausting process!  From the initial contact, of initiating contact through the Costco Auto Program, and the care that I was provided through each step of this process made it less stressful.  Every person that walked me through the process (Nadia, Robert, Fernando, Jacqueline and Juan) were so professional and thoughtful in making sure my questions and concerns were addressed!!<//review>

I have been coming here for the last two years. Each visit has been better than the last. Catherine, our service advisor, gives us great customer service with a can do attitude and is always up front with anything that will happen with our vehicle. The waiting area is nice, with self service coffee and the area is always kept so clean. We will miss servicing our vehicle here when we move in the next couple months.< /Review>

The only reason this is not a five star is because of a part that had to be special ordered.  Of course it is a part that I would not expect to be stocked, but it means that I have to go back to get it fixed.  The regular maintenance was done and I got a loaner car so I didn’t have to wait for it.  The service staff was very professional so I couldn’t ask for more.</Review>

Great service from Stephanie the sales advisor! She really made it easy and convenient for me. I came in without an appointment during covid and she was still able to get my car in and out within a couple of hours for an oil change!<//text>

We've been very happy with our services at Frank Subaru and enjoy the new/great facility. We easily scheduled our appointment, had super-fast check-in, and great communication about service options with our representative John. The service was efficient and seemed high quality and honest. We have had service elsewhere in the past, but will definitely continue going to Frank for our Subaru sales and service.</text>

Frank Suburu service department  continues to take good care of me and my Forester. Brian, the service writer was careful and conscientious to be sure I understood the work to be done. Tyler, the concierge was helpful in explaining some of the tech questions I had concerning my phone hookup.< /Review>

This was my third time getting a car serviced at Frank Subaru. All three times have exceeded expectations. Twice I was helped by Brian and once by Victor. Both were very professional and great communicators. The service was completed on time, all three times. The customer lounge is spacious and comfortable. Overall, a superior customer experience.</Review>

Took my Impreza after having indicator lights Come up and a transmission problem. lucky I did, all the issues where linked to a transmission issue that was covered on a extended Transmission warranty. Franks was able to squeeze me in and fix my car right away! Great service.< /Text>

<Text>We made an appointment to go look at and test drive a particular vehicle. Not only was everyone ready for us and on time, but they had already pulled the vehicle up and had it ready to go.  After the test drive, we knew that this was the vehicle that we wanted. The whole process was quick and easy. We didn't feel pressured by anyone at all. We were treated respectfully by everyone. Frank Subaru is a dog friendly place, so not only did they engrave custom tags for both of my dogs, but they showed me a special fenced in area that they have made for dogs. They have a great variety of things to choose from if you are hungry or thirsty, and a nice , large area to relax in.  We were given a tour of the vehicle service bay, and check in area as well as the whole facility. Nothing about our experience there was negative, and this was by far the best car buying event we have ever had.   :)< /Text><GmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35<//GmapID>< user_name>

Can't get wrong with the service department. Both my cars are getting service from this dept. And i just can't go anywhere else because of honest service they provide. They won't let you down, if the car needs a new parts, they will let you know before moving on with the repairs , they will also inform you of the parts price and labor. Very straight people and will come back again and again for service, don't matter if it is new or late model cars, they will help you with honest work.</Text>

<text>Fantastic shopping experience! Was able to view options in detail and walk the lot while ultimately trading in my Corolla. They made sure I was taken care of and worked with my budget.

Albert, Marco, Jackie & Mike were all super helpful in making it happen for me. I love the Crosstrek for me & my son.

The family owned dealership atmosphere & vibe definitely trickled down into the staff.

Time to go on some Subie adventures!

**edit** Service Review! Fantastic Service - was greeted by Bella & got my Apple CarPlay software updated + oil change. Easy twofer with quality service. Was given my Crosstrek back at the time originally scheduled. 🙌🏼< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1605734232389, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!

We bought a brand new Subaru Crosstrek with Subaru Frank and so happened that the car has sa small dent on the door. I was told by my sales person that they will make appointment for them to remove the dent but they never did it has been a year now. I have been trying to follow up with them but they just simply ignored it.</Review>

Marco was very helpful, friendly, and efficient! He did a great job helping us trade our car in for a 2020 Subaru Outback and was very personable! Especially during the pandemic where things were unusual with having to wear face coverings, he made the whole process very fun and easy! Thank you again, Marco!</Text>

Brian at Frank Subaru met me promptly to resolve my flat tire. They patched the tire. They also did an oil change, tire rotation, and in cabin filter which I had not previously scheduled. The waiting room is spacious and clean. There was plenty of room for social distancing.</Review>

Excellent Service Department, my extended warranty company was being difficult to reach and The service Advisor Catherine worked diligently and patiently, after 2 and a half weeks they were able to get through and get the work approved to service my car. I was also provided a loaner vehicle throughout this whole
process which made the long wait very convenient for my family.<//review>

Catherine helped me out for my entire service inquiry. She followed up on every call as well as provided updates on my vehicle's status. She went above and beyond what I knew whats possible for a dealership! I will definitely return here for my future services!!

Thank you Catherine!

Dropped my Outback off to have my horn repaired and to switch out the faulty airbag(s). They had my car for the 2 days they told it would take. I was offered a replacement car while they had mine, but I choose to not use it since it was during the stay at home order. They were friendly and the place was well kept.</Review>

The other two I’ve worked with were equally as good and Onder is a huge asset to that dealership.

My issue is that they are all overworked and there seems to be far too many cars to service safely.

Subaru is a great car with outstanding reputation and I only hope this dealership and corporate are as reputable and conscientious with their employees!

I failed to ask Brian if he’s treated well by the company  but my impression now for the 3rd time is that there are far too many cars and the employees are overwhelmed and overworked.  I can only imagine the mechanics are too and this is a safety issue!!

I think the dealers in this city with corporate need to open a satellite service NOT sales just service to absorb some of the volume. Let them all pitch in to pay for it and provide safe, sane conditions for employees and customers.

They go to work from 0630-6pm??? Please reconsider how you are treating these employees and the impact on the service if people are rushed and mechanics are rushed or pressured to finish! Brian was unflappable and highly impressive but the work load is too much!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Last year (2020): Staff members were constantly cleaning due to virus - I felt very assured health/safety wise. From service to sales to cleaning and support safe, I am impressed and grateful to be part of the Frank Subaru community. Thank you!

Updated April 2021: I am very disappointed by the customer service at Frank Subaru last week. I've had poor luck in getting nails in THREE of my tires... when a fourth tire was found to have ANOTHER nail in it (within a week of the third nail), Subaru told me that they would CHARGE me, even if they had to plug the tire. Are you kidding me?? After I spend $750+ on new tires on a NEW car I have had for just 1.5 years, you are going to charge me for a plug?! That is poor customer relations in general, as I've been working in labor relations for over a decade.

Instead of heading to Subaru (who also told me they had no loaners for a customer who just spent $750 on tires and $32K on the vehicle), I went to the incredible, reliable and supportive team at Discount Tire who PLUGGED MY TIRE FOR FREE!!! I didn't even buy these tires from DT, but because I was a past customer (brought my Toyota to them) they gladly and swiftly helped me.

Think twice before going to a dealership - especially if they take every nickel and dime for your suffering, especially in a pandemic. It's been a year since Covid and Subaru won't even clean your car or sanitize on the way out.<//text>

I did the majority of the process via Phone call, knew exactly what I was looking for, and when I arrived all I needed was to go over documents, sign, and got my car. I was in and out in less then an hour, which was amazing when you have 2 young children with you. All of staff was friendly and helpful.

Our overall experience with Frank Subaru was excellent.  During the purchase process we had pleasant, helpful and knowledgeable experiences with Nadia, Manny, Marco and Edith.  Thanks to all!  Special recognition to our Sales Mgr. Fred who helped to clarify any questions that my wife and I had.  We also appreciated his sense of humor and “attention to detail”.<//Text>

Emma P. really made my Frank Subaru experience an absolute pleasure. She was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions. There was never pressure  to "make a deal" like the other car dealerships around town which I appreciated immensely. Just helpful informative interaction.

Frank Subaru is amazing. I have had my Subaru WRX since 2018 and have had no problems when needing to come in for any service. Their customer service is exceptional and I always have relatable conversations. Waiting area is spacious, with the amenities of coffee and water if needed.

I always have a pleasant experience with the service dept. at Frank Subaru! We bought our Forester there, December 2018, and bought the service package that included 3 free oil changes. I just completed my 3rd free oil change. I set up my appointment by phone, and it was very easy. In the past, I set up my appointment online, and that too, was easy. When I arrived, they greeted me in the driveway and took my car immediately. I was in the lobby waiting room for about 90 minutes, which was the amount of time they estimated. Jacob was my service rep. this time, & he was pleasant & explained everything. Frank Subaru employees have always impressed me. They are very professional!

2021 update...
Still great service!! My 2019 Subaru Forester was serviced on 1/19/21, & Catherine was my advisor. Catherine was friendly, professional & explained everything about my service. There was even a recall that was needed, & all of that was handled during this appt.
My estimated wait time during the service was  two hours, so I waited in the waiting room. I was comfortable waiting there because Frank Subaru is following Covid protocol. Just shy of 2 hours, Catherine came & got me, explained that everything was taken care of and she walked me to the cashier.
From calling the service department to set up the appointment, to checking in with an employee who walks me around the outside of my car to note any current body damage, to driving away following the service, Frank Subaru service dept. is always a pleasure to work with!< /Text>

<Text>Frank Subaru is a GREAT dealership, and the only place I go for service only car.  They are friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient with the use of their time, as well as the customers.  Their facility is clean and modern and offers free bottled water, Starbucks products, and an area for kids to hang out and play and watch T.V.  They sell great Subaru products, too, as well as other toys and earbuds.  I always know I can relax, when I go there for any car service.</Text></record>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>The service I received was awufl

I dropped off my Forester at 8:45 AM for an oil change, to have a headlight bulb replaced, and for an alignment. I was told that there was a recall about a rear suspension spring. So, this is the first problem. Why was I not told about this in advance so I could plan on the car being in the shop much of the day instead of just an hour or so. Subaru had not sent me a recall notice. Frank Subaru said nothing about it when I made the appointment.

I was told it would be ready in the afternoon. I called my service agent at noon to ask for an updated time estimate. I left a message but received no call back. So, at 2 PM I emailed the service manager; in the past he was quick to respond to emails. No response by 3 PM so I called again and asked to talk to my service agent. I was told he was off that day. Strange, I saw him when I dropped off the car in the morning, which I told the person answering the phone. She then said he left early in the day, so I asked to talk to the Service Department manager and was told he was out sick. I was connected to another service agent that supposedly was covering for my service agent. I left a message to find out when my vehicle would be ready. I received no response

The next morning at 7:45 AM the Service Department manager called and apologized. He said that he would put two technicians on it. A couple of hours later he called to report the multi-point inspection. The vehicle was then ready about 11:45 AM. What this told me is that no work was done on my vehicle the entire day before. I asked the Service Manager if that was the case and he said that he did not know

So, to recap the problems. Subaru has a recall going on but is not telling the customers. My service agent leaves and no one contacts me with what is going on, even after I try to initiate contact. And I leave a vehicle at Frank Subaru at 8:45 AM for what was described as 3.5 hours of work and the mechanics did nothing on it all day

The service I received was awful. I understand that my service agent had to leave for something unexpected, but there are other people working there that should be covering. And that does not explain the mechanics not working on it all day. The service I received was horrible!</Review>< Pics>

Excellent service! Started with making the appoint and had availability the next day at the perfect time.  Service rep Brian clearly explained the service I was getting and estimated cost. I decided to stay and work in their lobby. Great free WiFi and refreshments. Car was ready sooner than expected and the price was exactly as quoted. Because I was there for a service maintenance, I qualified for a free exterior car wash too!!! Really felt they know how to treat their customers. Good on you Frank Subaru!< /Text>

I needed to get my 2011 Impreza in because of an airbag recall. I decided to get some other minor work done at the same time. I was given reasonable quotes, a short wait time, and a 2020 Forester loaner car. One of the associates gave me a quick rundown on some of the features of the loaner car that I would not have figured out easily. I didn't have anyone try to get me to trade in my Impreza for a newer model as had happened at another dealership. All workers wore masks and I was able to keep a safe distance. It was a straightforward, well executed experience that would make me return.< /text>

<review>At Frank Subaru we received excellent customer service. Marco Vasquez, our sales contact, took us to tour the place. He showed us the cars that we wanted to see and answered all our questions without the pressure of the sale or that he needed to move on to the next client.

Now we are very happy with our 2020 Subaru Ascent límited. The contract sign off was a breeze and the place comfy  enough to have my kids with me.

A truly great experience that I will recommend to   Family and friends!</review><gmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35< /gmapID><response>{'time': 1575326623863, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write this great review!

In general I have been really happy with Frank Subaru.  I purchased my vehicle in 2013, and have continued to use them to service and repair it.  They have been kind, professional, and even have delivered parts to my home.  There have been some minor issues, but they always sought to make it right.  What else can you ask for?</Review>

****HORRIBLE SERVICE FROM FRANK SUBARU****

SUBARU CORP = SOA

Hi Fellow Subie Members,

These pictures below is what i call "a shady dealership". They are even willing to open the gates of service dep after hours to get my car out! This dealer is FRANK SUBARU in National City. Soo the story behind my STI is the following. The past 3 months i have gotten a

Service 1
transmission mounts re-tighten, rear brakes replaced (warranty). After this service problem started to arise.
Transmission woulnt shift right and cluncking started same week it was returned. Oh and DAMAGED MY ADVAN WHEELS IN THE PROCESS. Took it back

Service 2
Dealer performs a full transmission rebuild, replaces clutch and flywheel, and everything necessary to replace all that. (Imagen)
1 week later get it back make a turn on E st (chula vista) to head to the 5 frwy north shift down from 4th to 3rd and hear a loud pop, and car goes on limp mode. Soo i tow it to Frank Subaru.

Service 3
Dealer calls me asking me if i tuned the car because the ecu is fried. My answer is hell no! They check and everything checks out. Soo they check my STI more in detail and they see the Motor mount is broken and my wire harness connector is damaged. I believe, if the motor moves its gonna damage the connector easily. After argueing with the Manager (Onder) he states, "SOMEONE DAMAGED THE CONNECTOR ON PURPOSE WITH PLIERS". Mount is under warranty but Harness is not DUE TO DAMAGE. I call Subaru Corp and create a complaint. Next day dealer calls me immediately to return their rental and pick up my STI cause i called Subaru Corp and there is a Trust issue. Manager (Onder) tell me they are not going to work on my STI anymore, not even fix the warranty motor mount. All i told Corp is the truth and dealer didnt like it. Dealer was hiding the motor mount defect from corp, i know this because, when i spoke to rep at corp told them to story and she said dealer didnt tell her that. Just the wireharness connect damage.

This is my story and there is more to it. But its already long as is...

I recommend for my fellow subie owners to not take your car to Frank Subaru. TAKE YOUR BUISNESS ELSEWHERE!

Still waiting on Subaru Corp.

I hope it get to the right people at Frank Subaru!

Thank you!

MANAGER THAT REPLIED! AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION HARNESS WAS DAMAGED BY THE INTERCOOLER BRACKET! DUMB TECHS AND MANAGERS! THERE IS EVIDENCE ON THE BRACKET OF IT HAVING PLASTIC FROM THE HARNESS COVER!! Will be in small claims for my damaged wheels! Since you guys dont make it right! And not only did the DUMB TECHS DIDNT DIAGNOSE THE CAR RIGHT SINCE THE START FRKM WHEN MY BATTERY INFLATED AND CAUSE RUST. EVEN STATED THERE WAS OIL IN INTERCOOLER AND DIDNT EVEN CHECK THAT! SERVICE IN THIS DEALER IS A JOKE!!<//text>

Without going into all the details, I will explain your complaint about the engine  harness that is not covered by warranty. The marks on the harness indicates a tool was used, which caused the damage, and not the motor mount. We contacted Subaru of America and provided the pictures of your harness and an explanation. They denied coverage due to condition of the harness.\n\nWe believe it would be in the best interest of Frank Subaru, and yourself to have your work completed at another Subaru Dealership.\n\nRespectively,\nMichael Wilkes\nGeneral Manager\nFrank Subaru'}<//Resp>

Service was amazing but... the advisor made me an appointment for a week later to have my car looked at for 3 different diagnosis and the day after this I got a call saying she made the appointment wrong and they can’t look at it that day since it is now full with cars being diagnosed. So now I’m stuck paying $35 for a rental she said would be covered under my service due to being under warranty. Dissappointed since I drive 25 minutes to come here instead of going to the El Cajon location due to having amazing service here before.< /text>

<Text>Our experience at Frank Subaru was amazing start to finish. From our first test drive with Jose, to James helping us through the finance process, it was seamless and fun. Jose truly cared about what we were going to be using our new forester for, so he could help match us with the best product for our lifestyle. James made the finance process/paperwork understandable and honest. Overall we are extremely pleased with the purchase we made and the straightforward and helpful staff at Frank Subaru!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1571697758777, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5 star review!

Sending your car into the shop is never a fun time, but Brian made this the most painless experience possible.

<Review>I left my car here for a engine repair under warranty. During the process Brian always communicated with me with any updates on my car, he was super friendly. He was also always ready to answer my question. I’m beyond satisfied with the costumer services I received, they were even nice enough to buy chocolates from my girlfriend who was fundraising.

Best car buying experience ever! The people were really helpful and responsive, the buying process was efficient, and they spent time explaining the details of the car so we would be comfortable in it right away. Highly recommended!!<//Text>

I just moved to California for military, so it’s my first time going somewhere new since I’ve gotten my car. Frank Subaru has changed my oil so fast every time I’ve gone and they don’t try to pressure me to do more than I need done. I have two kids that i have to bring with me while my husband is deployed, but it isn’t a problem because they have a great space to keep children occupied. It’s the nicest place I’ve brought my car to be serviced and I look forward to being their customer while I’m still in California.< /Review>

Rather dissatisfied. Ignition had to be repaced. Cost almost $800. Forester is just over 4 years old with only 35,200 miles. Out of warranty.  This should not have happened. The service rep was very nice and apologetc and gave me the 800 number to contact corporate. Would have liked Frank Subaru to have helped more. Plus charged $140 an hour labor, ouch. Also coupons should state amount of savings, not a lower price. Usually amounts to about a $5 savings when you think you are getting more. I could have had the repair done much cheaper at an independent mechanic. I may never go back to the dealer for any further repairs or service.<//text>

< Review>
I always have a great experience with Frank Subaru. My only concern with this visit was that the employees in the driveway didn’t seem as fully cognizant about maintaining social distancing. They were wearing gloves but didn’t appear to be changing them much, if at all, and were handling a lot of items. Every time they passed me keys (a few times because I had a loaner) I felt as if they were cross contaminating and they weren’t offering sanitizer outside to help with that</Review>

All corana virus protection procedures were used. The purchasing process went quick and Jacqueline was very friendly explained everything we need to know about the documents needing to be signed. Never any pressure to buy any other things that were offered. I highly recommend this dealership

Recently we had another great experience at Frank Subaru. This is the second car we've bought from them. Even though he wasn't feeling well, our salesperson, Marco, took extra time with us to answer all our questions and ensure we got the car we wanted. We never felt pressured or rushed about anything. Jackie made the finance part of our visit fast and easy. Everyone went above and beyond to make the process as painless as possible. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Text>Frank's Subara sales and service departs are the tops. Professional, courteous, and very communicative. When waiting for the vehicle being serviced you can set your clock to the time they say the work will be completed. What more could you ask for?!?

<username>Elgene Crescini< /username><date>1587589154585</date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>I recently brought my 2014 Subaru Forester XT for a recall for the rear coil springs.  Service took a little longer than expected but it was nice that they Lyfted me back to my home and to pick up my vehicle.  My service advisor was nice and everything was as expected.

Now the reason for the low rating is because as I was leaving, my service advisor told me that there is a leak on the vehicle that required attention.  I told her I have been complaining about that leak for years (June 2017) when the vehicle was well within warranty but their service manager told me that the transmission was only seeping (not dripping) and did not warrant a warranty repair.  I find it ironic that now that the vehicle is out of warranty, they are telling me it needs attention.

I have friends that are technicians for dealerships such as Toyota, Honda, Mazda, and even Subaru.  They told me that because Warranty repairs don’t justify the amount of work that is being done, they will make any excuse to not do the work.  I have even brought the vehicle to private repair shops who recommended I get the vehicle repaired under warranty.

I contacted Subaru of America and spoke to Kiersten, who was kind, who told me that because the vehicle is out of warranty, they can only give me a $350 coupon towards the repair that can only be redeemed at an authorized Subaru repair facility.  Keep in mind, a repair of this magnitude would be thousands of dollars.  I had an extended warranty through my financial institution that covered 100% costs with $0 deductible.  If they had repaired the vehicle when I had initially complained about the leak, this review would be 5 Stars instead of 1.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I cannot say enough good about this dealership. I have been interacting with the service department now for over six years. My service advisor, John Loss, is one of the best I’ve ever dealt with and I have owned Subarus for over 25 years. They are fair and honest. It’s an honest opinion based on experience.< /Review>

Very rude asks what do you want. I explain and he goes inside. Sales guy comes back out with a sheet hers the price of the car a month 63 months 3.9 interest 450+ a month for the base model.  Very rude never showed me a car. Going to buy Toyota Rav 4 instead because of this poor service</Text>

<Text>Went in for the huge valve spring recall. It took them a really long time to get to my car but it was that reasonable. They had a lot of cars in for the same recall. I was given a rental for the entirety of the work so I wasn’t inconvenienced. I worked with Catherine who was always informative whenever I had questions and helped me get my car through the recall as quickly as possible. I really thank her and all the mechanics for all their hard work on this recall. Thank you for taking good care of my Subaru.</Text>< response>

<review>Frank’s Subaru is an awesome car dealership.
Their service department provides great customer service.

Had my  2019 Forester in the other day for routine maintenance which they did in 80 minutes or so while I waited in their comfortable lounge.

Great customer service and very comfortable waiting lounge area with complimentary Starbucks coffee and bottled water. Brian, my customer service rep did a great job explaining in detail what was going to be done on my Subaru Forester. Also, I had a question about roof rack and the rap and parts came out and handed me a printed copy of prices and took me upstairs to see the actual Thule case I was interested in. He definitely went above and beyond and I certainly appreciated it.</Review>

Not only are they exceptional with customer service. They have a beautiful waiting room, with a spout to refill your water bottle, a Starbucks coffee dispenser and multiple vending machines. They have sparkling clean restrooms and even a small well maintained dog park for your lil pups to play in while they do your service (oh and they have biodegradable pet waste bags ✔️) such a great space with wonderful people and wonderful vehicles!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Went for my first 6,000 mile service and ECM program recall. They were very accommodating to change my appointment to an earlier date. I dropped my car off, then went home and the car was finished two hours later. Can't beat the free service. Staff were all courteous and professional. I was a little disappointed my car wasn't washed, but they said it was due to rain being forecast.<//Review>

This initial review is purely from transactional point. I found my Crosstrek the color I like with the configuration I want. I asked prices online and while I got a discounted price somewhere else but for a different color, Frank Subaru matched the price for the car I wanted. I told them when I was coming, and they reserved the car under my name. After a test drive, few signatures and a check, the car was ready to drive. They took their time to show me the car features after I already paid, which is very nice. Everybody was polite and helpful. The whole experience was great.</Review>

<Text>Frank Subaru is where I should have purchased my Crosstrek. Their staff are progressional yet friendly and their maintenance crew are obviously capable. I've brought my modified Crosstrek in on multiple occasions for maintenance and never had an issue with their ability to work around aftermarket parts. The service reps are quick and simple with communications and turn around has been ahead of schedule. Rental provided was nice as well.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>As a mechanic, I’ve avoided dealerships as often as I can. However, I can’t do my own work anymore because I don’t have a garage where I live. Frank Subaru is a good as it gets. They do quality work at a reasonable price with lots of extras included. Each time I’ve gone in, they’ve suggested extra service, but when I said no thank you, they didn’t continue trying to sell me on it. They’re respectful, honest and helpful. Highly recommended.< /review><Response>{'time': 1569529061670, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5 stars!

Each time we were treated with friendly and courteous attention from the sales representatives. When we decided to buy,  each staff member we dealt with was patient and friendly making the process as painless as possible.

The letter that I received mentioned a 75 minute wait for the new installation . When I arrived at Frank's, I was told 2 to 3 hours (and I had an appointment!). As it turned out, I was there less than 2 hours. I blame Subaru for not being realistic on the installment time and I thank Frank's for doing their best to accommodate me.< /review>

My Crosstrek is 14 months old with only 5,400 miles.  I haven't been driving because I am working from home due to the Pandemic.  Subaru is requiring me to bring my car for service even if I don't have the miles for service.  This week I just took my Crosstrek for it's 2nd service with only 5,400 miles on it.
I am so disappointed with Subaru, because they already used 2 of my free services to service my car that is mostly sitting in the garage because I'm working  from home due to the pandemic.  They insisted that I have to take it for service every 6 months or every so many miles, whichever comes first. Now I only have 2 more services for free (they already used 2).  My concern is that they just waisted 2 of my services and when the time comes and I really need these services done on my car I would not have them available anymore.  I think Subaru needed to reconsider this issue.<//Text>

The level of service and customer care is out standing. The staff there took the time to explain the repairs that were needed and the repairs that were suggested. They also took the time to make sure I was comfortable with the rental car that I had to use. I have yet to have a different experience.</text>

Customer service is great! The lounge is comfy especially the Starbucks coffee either hot or iced. They also have great selection accessories for you or for your Subaru. Love this spot.</Review>

<Review>I had a great experience at Frank Subaru with the online team (Andrea Baquera)and also the sales team(Frederick Beraud and Raul) at the dealerships we’re great. I want to add a Subaru dealerships in the area even to Ontario. I was looking for a WRX The other dealerships were giving me a hard time because the WRX was “high in demand” None would budge on MSRP. The experience I had at Frank Subaru was completely night and day compared to the others. Nice from start. Very informative. Professional. Courteous. And they were willing to work with me on getting great deal. Very happy with my purchase< /Review>< pics>

The customer service and lounge at Frank Subaru’s service department is great. They are friendly and treat you like a valued customer.

I had an engine oil leak and they took care of it under warranty (I bought the Gold Package) as well as other parts that needed replacing.</Text>

Outstanding service. The team here is punctual and they communicate clearly and often as you wait in a well appointed (and very clean) waiting room.

One issue I have is that the reccommended service items provided at the end are a expensive and mostly unnecessary, seems a lot like upselling to me. Just make it clear what is necessary and what is optional.< /text>

Frank Subaru at National City was the perfect dealer to buy my new and first Subaru. The staff is friendly, welcoming, and explain every question that you may have. Marco was my sales person and I totally recommend that you approach him. He is friendly, and honest, he makes sure you are comfortable and you are getting what you are looking for.< /review>

Frank Subaru of National City is awesome. All the sales staff that I interacted with were great. Fernando Ruiz (there are 2 Fernando R’s) is outstanding and made my car-buying experience stress-free and enjoyable. I highly recommend seeing Fernando. He is extremely friendly and thorough, and was a delight to work with. Car-shopping can feel like a daunting task. However, I never once felt pressured to make a purchase. I was extremely pleased with my car-buying experience. Sadly, on day 2 of owning my car I was unlucky and got a screw stuck in my tire. Fernando called me to follow up and make sure that the tire got fixed and that all was running safely and well with my car. Sincere sales individuals like Fernando Ruiz are true assets to their dealerships and elevate the Subaru company. I will be recommending Fernando Ruiz and Frank Subaru to all of my friends.</Text>

Very efficient and easy, we came early to drop it off just because we happened to be swinging by but not expecting it to be done for a while but it was done by the time our original appointment was made< /text>

Great customer service, even found a $25 coupon to help with the cost! I will definitely keep using Frank Subaru for my car’s service needs. Quick, efficient, and nice customer lounge - they even had a play place for small kids!<//Text>

Bryan was very courteous, attentive and detail oriented.
He listened well,  explained the details throughly  and treated me like one of his family. It was a very busy day, even with an appointment, a routine service and a recall inspection took about 3 hrs.; the only negative aspect of the experience.Thats why I only ranked it 4 stars.
Thanks for the coffee machine and snacks
PS
I need to come back for a recall replacement part which would have taken another 3-4 hrs that day if I stayed  and waited to have it done. Now I need to leave my car for a day to have the necessary recall repair.....oh well; glad it can be fixed.<//Text>

<Review>I purchased my 2016 Outback in Northern California but it resides in San Diego where I have a second home.  The car has very low miles but I make sure all the preventative maintenance gets taken care of.  I had a so-so experience with one San Diego dealer so decided to give Frank Subaru a try for the next service.  I have now been back three times and give them 5-stars because they delivered.  Each appointment was easy to schedule, available times were convenient, they explained what they needed to do, what it would cost and how long it would take.  I have had no surprises and my car was returned to me clean and on time.  The waiting area is very clean, quiet and comfortable.  I needed to make a long conference call during my last visit.  They waited until I had finished my call, then let me know my car was ready.  Very courteous and efficient.<//Review>< pictures>

Our service rep, Katherine, is a gem!  She got our Forester in on the recall for the front passenger seat air bag and our trip north for Christmas has been much more relaxed knowing it is fixed.

<review>If I could give Frank Subaru 10 stars, I absolutely would! Beginning to end, it was the BEST experience my husband and I have EVER had at a Dealership. If you’re looking for a new car, this should be your first AND only stop. Nothing was a hassle, everything was smooth and transparent. We worked with Fernando most of the day and finished with Mike and Lisa (finance). Everyone was extremely pleasant and had excellent Customer service skills. Fernando really deserves his own shout out! He was so patient, very helpful and extremely knowledgeable. He never tried to pressure us or upsell. He truly made the experience wonderful! I had a trade in that I knew I was upside down in and they offered me a good deal without low balling the number.
They have a small dog park area and will even make an engraved dog tag while you’re there! They have thought of everything! I will always recommend Frank Subaru to anyone and everyone!< /review>< pictures>

My car has really low mileage, but the six month was up for a 24000 mile check up, with lots of replacements. Spoke with service advisor Katherine, n was able to save the factory coupon for when my car gets there. In the meantime, I paid for a regular oil change. This was great. Thank you Katherine and Frank Subaru for giving my car time.<//review>

They have good service and the waiting room is pretty clean. Four stars because they can’t take walk ins. When I used to have Toyota, I could always come in without an appointment for my oil change even though they are busy.< /Text>

<Review>Frank Subaru gives great costumer service. They get your car in and out in a timely manner and they also offer loaner car if you need to be at work during longer maintenance services. Excellent waiting room with drinks and snacks. Clean restroom and phone/laptop charging stations.</Review>< pics>

Our experience buying a new car at Frank Subaru was the best we could have imagined. Everyone was friendly, efficient and enjoyable to work with. Moises especially. But really everyone was great and the dealership is very welcoming and comfortable. The experience couldn’t have been better and it definitely could have been a lot worse. We love our new car. Thank you!<//Text>

Excellent customer service throughout Frank Subaru. I worked with Sale Associate Francisco Corral . He answered all my questions and provided a very comfortable and stress free environment. Even after my purchase he followed up to make sure I was 100% satisfied and had no further questions.
I was surprised to receive a call from the General Manager, Michael Wilks. He called me to welcome me to the Subaru family and ask me if I had any further questions. I will be definitely be returning to Frank Subaru for my next purchase. Thank you!</review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>Friendly, but their desk staff doesn’t seem to communicate well and I’m not even sure the service specialist who checked me in understood why I was there. I called to ask about drop ins, was asked to leave my info and told they’d note down that I was coming. I arrived the next morning and the person who met me said, “uhh.... do you know who you talked to?” After they decided that yes, it was okay I was a drop-in they sent a “service specialist” out to see why I was there. He was very friendly but completely didn’t understand why I’d come in. I’d had recurring battery problems and was concerned there is an issue with the electrical. After the third time he said, “okay, so you got a jump start yesterday. We’ll check your battery and then charge it” I gave up, since it was clear that he wasn’t listening or comprehending when I said, “I’ve had recurrent battery problems, this is a brand new battery that I just had tested and it’s still fine, and am concerned there is either something draining it or a problem with the alternator”. At that point, I had no confidence they’d be able to troubleshoot anything within the timeframe I needed and decided to wait until I could take it to my normal shop. I ended up waiting there for over 3 hours after he estimated an hour and a half, and didn’t even get the proper thing looked at.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My service advisor was busy when I arrived, so Michelle promptly came out to start the paperwork. She explained that due to my low mileage, I probably didn’t need the full service I was scheduled for, so they would simply inspect the various items and only replace them if it was necessary. I appreciated the honesty... and the money saved. While I was sitting in the lounge, I received a text from Victor stating my car service was complete. Easy peasy! I’ll definitely be coming back.
The only thing that I was bummed about was that they stopped doing a complimentary car wash. Now it is only done if your service is over $150.</Review>

Great showroom with lots of little extras.
They have a small dog park and a pet welcome desk where you can get a bandana and a personalized ID tag for your pet.
When you arrive they are quick to offer you assistance and something to drink (water or coffee) but they aren't pushy.
The salesman gave us a short tour of the showroom and service area.<//Review>

Friendly staff, great waiting room and more. Pulling up to service I was greeted by my service guy and within minutes he got everything rolling. They have a waiting room that has a Starbucks coffee machine + vending machines + tv. I was completely sold with their coffee machine and I got a free car wash.</Review>

< review>
We called before make appointment to see Camaro SS 1LE, when we arrived over there the car was ready outside with reserved name for my teenage son (of course he's happy for that 😀). Our sales person, Moses Echeverria is very nice person, very polite, professional,  efficient and knowledgeable. He made the transaction very fast for us. Very satisfied with his business attitude. Signing all the documents also fast n efficient with their computerized table.  Also since we live 90 miles away from Frank Subaru, not only they filled in gasoline for our new car, they also filled in gasoline for our other car which we're going to Frank Subaru dealer. Thumbs up for them,  keep all the good works guys.< /review>

Ever since the move, service has been forced to become a meat grinder. Push in vehicle, push out vehicle. Charge maximum amount. The hometown dealership feel is fading. Cashier ladies are usually pretty friendly. Parts department is outstanding. Not only does the manager know his job well, it reflects in his employees and the customer service that follows. Pay raises for those guys. No recent experience with sales/finance. Hopefully the grumpy little finance guy has moved on.

Update: Sales/Finance is untouchable in San Diego. Even with the ‘rona scare, I was in and out with ridiculous price discounts that no other dealer would come close to. Parts is still amazing. Service is still “there is nothing wrong because we have recalls to worry about and you can schedule an appointment for 2030”.</Text>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Got to my weekday appointment early and no one helped me until my appointment time, meanwhile another person arrived after me for their appointment and were helped before me. I waited 10-15 min in my car for a simple 10k service. It took about another 1 hr and 20 min for my routine oil change and waited another 30 minutes for a complimentary “car wash” (still had bug spots on my wind shield). Had I known that the car wash was a splish splash job, I could’ve done a better job at home. Lesson learned: arrive to your appointment on time (not too early and not too late and decline the car wash).

When I purchased my new car, the employees made it seemed like they were exponentially caring and made it seem like services from then on would be the same. Since then, I have not seen the same service I had at time of purchase.  Ever since then it’s been difficult to get anything done.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>This review is focused on their Parts and Service department. JP and his staff have been providing me parts for my 2005 Subaru Forester. They've always given me the best prices. They even price match! The service department is good. They always keep me posted on my vehicles status! The service might be pricey depending on what you need done.  I will continue to go their for all my Subaru parts though..<//Text><gmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35<//gmapID><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

We were very impressed with John Loss! He was very professional and great fun to work with! As has been our experience at Frank Subaru since we bought our Forester (March 2018), the people and service are exemplar!!! We bought our first Subaru back in '89 and have never been disappointed. Thanks for keeping the brand and service excellent!<//Text>

I give Frank Subaru my best rating for customer service. I demand serious attention for every issue I bring to their attention and they deliver as expected on all aspects. I could not be more pleased with my purchase. There are still a few minor glitches which I expect with a new vehicle and I'm very confident they will be remedied to my satisfaction. Nadia, John and Victor in service  as well as Fernando in sales have been particularly attentive. Thanks

Frank's is my on go-to service center. I've had the same service advisor for over two years (John Loss) and he is always looking for what more he can do to keep his clients happy.

All the staff are welcoming and friendly, and genuinely appears to like working at Subaru.

Expansive service center, thorough technicians that will come out and ask you questions about any concerns that you have, and always willing to help.<//text>

Such a pleasant experience from beginning to end, over the course of a month, filled with test drives and financing options. I felt truly taken care of and oriented throughout the entire proces. The employees at Frank Subaru take their time with you, without resorting to high pressure tactics, and give you top shelf service from sales through finance through parts/service. Highly recommended!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I came here to get my car serviced and because I received a notice recall. Their service department is superb.

Compared to Kearny Mesa, I felt like Frank Subaru's sale was a little greedy on their negotiations. However, having being serviced but both, Frank Subaru has way better customer service. Their location is more spacious; they didn't seem to overbook, so I was attended to promtly; the lady that went over the paperwork was really nice and thorough; they provided a Lyft to/from home.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Brought my 2017 Subaru Outback for an oil-change, tire-rotation and safety check. I had an early morning appointment (Weds., 07:30) and waited with my dog for the service to be completed. While waiting the dog and I enjoyed the on-site enclosed mini-dog park, as well as complementary coffee in the comfortable customer waiting area. The service took a bit less than an hour to complete and included a complimentary car wash. The staff was friendly, courteous and professional. We purchased our Subaru new from Frank's and were very impressed with our experience. Frank's continues to meet and exceed our expectations with each experience. Congratulations to the entire staff and keep up the good work!<//Review>< Pics>

The service manager MARIA was the most friendly, professional person I have ever experienced in a car dealership. She went way above and beyond to help me and make sure I was taken care of before I left. She’s been at the company 40 years, they are lucky to have her! If she was selling cars I would buy a new one every year just to visit her again.</review>

This was a no brainier.  There was no pressure to purchase a car.  Albert kept us under budget.  Hassle free.  We are a Subaru family now.< /text>

Felt like family. Great environment. My kids were able to play during the entire purchase process and told me they want to come back. Entire staff was helpful. If you go there, ask for Jorge. The 71 year old Cuban guy with more life in him then a 10 year old. He was literally skipping and singing to help us out.< /Text>

This was our second time going to FRANK SUBARU and we had nothing but great experience. Albert Castellanos was our salesman and he was very helpful and gave us all the information we needed. I would highly recommend this place for your next car purchase.< /Review>

I went in for scheduled service on my 2018 Forester.  I was told it would take around 45 minutes.  I waited in the lounge after I cruised the new cars in the showroom and in the lot.  The lounge is nice, free drinks, and makes the waiting easy.  My car was ready in 40 minutes.  What can I say, it was good service.<//text>

Frank Subaru Is the best!
I come in and they take care of all my issues going on with my car.
The staff is wonderful, I would recommend for the cashier ladies to be a little nicer. The cashiers are the last person you deal with and they both seem like they hate their jobs?

I do have to point out the the service team who are the ones who take your car in, Are Fantastic.

The waiting room is nice and the free Starbucks is a nice touch.

Thank you all for doing such a great job.<//Text>

The service was excellent. The service advisor, John, is affable and knowledgeable as well. He helped me to understand what services will be included in this visit and what are the recommended services. But he didn’t try to sell you those services. Overall, it is a great experience.<//review>

Brian, and the entirety of the service team, were extremely efficient. Brian presented us with a brief on the progress of the required service and our Forrester was ready to take home well within the estimated time presented at check in. The Frank Subaru team gave us the best service experience we've had with any car we've owned in the past. Thank you.< /Text>

Very nice service.  When buying remember tack on the taxes (your zip code), fees, and the last minute sales by the financing department.  Never settle for more.  Reserve the car if you are too tired to think straight before entering the financing room.  I'm very happy with my purchase, the service and the staff got theirs as well.  All happy and will be my first stop for next purchase and recommend to family/friends.</text>

My husband and I recently bought an SUV at this dealership. Our sales person, Brianne, did an amazing job. She answered all of our questions, was polite and respectful--never pushing--but instead allowing us to make the decision on our own. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is looking for a Subaru. Thank you.<//Review>

<Review>Frank Subaru in National City in the San Diego area has an excellent service department in their beautiful new building on the Mile of Cars.

On a recent visit, they couldn’t have been more professional, friendly and helpful.  In particular, Michelle was great!    She and the others assisting me were patient, answered all my questions, and were happy to be of service to their customers.

The appointment I made was honored even on a busy day during the long Thanksgiving weekend, and the requested service was done properly and within the estimated time.   They texted me as soon as it was done.  And included a free car wash.  Very nice!

Meanwhile, they provided a very pleasant environment to wait, get online, etc., and offered a free shuttle to nearby malls for shopping.    Highly recommended!<//Review><rate>4</rate><gmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35</gmapID><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1543526075188, 'text': 'Thank you for the 5 star review, David!

Sales people tried to trick me out of thousands of dollars and didn't care or try to rectify the situation.
Details:
I was literally about to hand them my credit card, and when I checked the price just to confirm, salesman said the price they had told did not apply to the car I was buying through the Costco auto program (but was not going to tell me!) - tried to sell me the car for $2,000 more dollars.  Did not try or care to rectify this large mistake.  I then tried to buy a base model and they lied about having a true base model and tried to sell me a car for $1,700 more, saying this was a base model, when it was not.  Then, refused to order me a base model.  Ultimately, they tried to trick me multiple times instead of selling me the car I asked for.</Text>

Thanks for the follow up. My service experience was excellent. The waiting room was clean and a great space to get my work done. Coffee was great and I was also able to connect with another Subaru owner about our cards.
My car is running great…I look forward to the next service.< /Review>

I had a great experience with Frank Subaru, our salesman, Mr. Arturo Camarena, was very attentive and he probided us a superb customer service. I did my homework and went to other dealership but still ended with these guys just because of their great customer service. I got the car that I wanted with a great deal. Definitely recommend Frank Subaru!!!</text>

Manny at Frank Subaru is absolutely awesome. He was very knowledgeable about our Ascent. If I had any questions I was free to ask him any time and any day. Everyone I spoke to at the dealership was very nice and more than willing to help. I highly recommend them!!<//review>

John Loss from the Service Department has proven to be (on a repetitive basis) an amazing over-achiever in regards to customer service and willingness to help. I have a 2017 Subaru Outback and the battery was not holding a charge well enough to start the car if the lights were left on for over 30 seconds.

I was outside of my warranty by 6k miles (but well under 36 months). Jason and his supervisor tested the battery anyway and were willing to replace it as a courtesy if it failed their test. I am still waiting for the results of the test but just to have the chance of a replacement is great! This demonstrates how the dealership and service department are willing to help a customer and try to make a frustrating situation a more palatable one!! Nice job John and crew!!

Update: battery failed the test and Frank Subaru amazingly replaced it for me!! Excellent customer service by a very knowledgeable staff. I highly recommend trusting Frank Subaru for your car maintenance needs!!< /Review>

Frank Subaru has completed raised the bar on auto service and customer relations. From the moment you pull up into their shiny new service bay, you are immediately greeted by a very friendly rep who checks you in for your service appointment. You are assigned a main representative who then carefully walks you through the process and does a great job with explaining everything. My rep for the last three visits has been Annie. She's the BEST!

TIP: If you happen to have a dog, make sure you get one of their free custom Subaru tags.</Text>

I called a week before my appointment and the service advisor assured me I would have a loaner car because there were several recalls so it would take longer than a normal service. When I arrived, there were no loaner cars available and heard the advisors discussing the situation. They said there was one loaner being reserved for a very important customer. Really? I've been going to Frank Subaru for more than 10 years and called to reserve a loaner far in advance. As if I'm  not an important customer? Discouraging. The lady advisor finally calls enterprise (which took quite awhile) to get me a rental where I had to leave a deposit on my own credit card which no one explained and the car was less than desirable, though the people there were helpful and nice. When returning to pick up my car, I checked out and the valet was talking to another advisor and completely ignoring me. I sat and waited until I finally had to say, "can I just get my keys?" At which point my orginal advisor had to walk me out bc the valet was still ignoring me and just standing there. I open my car to see my driver seat cover was completely torn and ripped up. I've been coming to frank Subaru a long time and this was my first negative experience. Service seems to be slipping. Disappointed.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Purchased my new Subaru Outback at Frank Subaru through the Costco Program - truly the only way to buy a car.

Everyone at the dealership was polite, respectful and professional.  While they didn’t have the exact model/package I was looking for, they went above and beyond to find it at another location.

When the car arrived, they took the time to walk me through all the car’s features and even scheduled the first maintenance.

The financing process was very easy and they worked hard to get me in and out as quickly as possible.

I would highly recommend Frank Subaru to anyone looking for a new Subaru.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1538591151358, 'text': 'We really appreciate your outstanding review.'}< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I switched to Frank Subaru after 6 years going to Kearny Mesa. Both customer and car service here leaves KM Subaru in the dust. They have a huge customer waiting area with complimentary drinks etc and I love that they also have a big intake area for the cars unlike those other inferior dealerships. Catherine at service has been helping me for years at the other dealership for all those years and I'm glad I found her again Frank Subaru. She is phenomenal at customer service.<//Text></record>

I especially love the complimentary car wash with every service.

The waiting area is comfortable and spacious.  The y have charging stations for your devices.  TV's to watch, complimentary refreshments.

Good service and you can poke around all of the new models while you wait for your car.

Check out the accessories they have available.  Even a tent that sits safely on top of your car...out of the reach of lions and tigers and bears.<//text>< user_id>

So happy with how smooth and enjoyable my experience was buying a new car at this location with the help of George Abraira. He was very helpful and accommodating to me. Didn't feel pressured at all. I test drove in the morning but had to leave the lot to get my son from school. Gave me time to think it through. George made it easy to come back and pick up where we left off. The staff is awesome and they all seem like they genuinely care about their costumers not just trying to make a buck. Clean establishment. They take pride in their cars. Go here for your new car, you won't regret it!< /Text>

I bought my Outback here and only have it serviced here. The staff is friendly and professional. The facility is amazing!  It has everything, something for my dog, something for my kids, and even a Starbucks coffee machine for my wife (yes it does iced coffee!). If you’re looking to buy your next Subaru or need somewhere to service yours, Frank Subaru is a place.</text>

The sides and windows were cleaned, but the roof was dirty.  I did not notice that at the dealership, but it was noticeable when I started to wipe down the excess water.  If you are offering a service, you might want to do a better job.  Better yet, the advisor should be the one to inspect the car before turning it over to the owner.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1538589207958, 'text': 'Thank you for the review and your feedback.'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

Since the moment I walked in, nothing but friendly staff helping me find exactly what I was looking for! Everyone other dealership I went to I felt pressured and swarmed by car salesmen that didn’t even know much about the vehicles I was checking out. My saleswomen, Emma Rose Plouffe, took excellent care of me and my family the entire time we were there and knew so much about the vehicle and Subaru as a company that I was blown out of the water. I wanted to stick with Subaru, but had many other options as well like the Toyota RAV4 and the Mazda CX-5. Emma was part of the reason I stuck with Subaru by how friendly and caring she was. 10/10 saleswomen and staff, I would recommend to anyone looking for a new car!<//text>< pictures>

Buying a car through Costco at Frank Subaru was a great experience.  The Costco sales manager, Robert, took his time to explain the program and how all cars under this program are sold at a fixed price set by Costco and there was no pressure or haggling.  We drove two different versions of the Outback with Fernando our sales guy, figured out the exact car we wanted, and were told the price.  It was way below MSRP and we agreed immediately to purchase the vehicle.  We had a tow hitched installed and picked up the car a few days later.  Fernando was extremely helpful and never once did we feel the normal pressure we have experienced before at other car dealerships.  The service guy I dealt with for the hitch installation was very professional and a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend Frank Subaru, especially with the Costco buying service.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>Catherine did an amazing job at getting the service of my forester done by going above and beyond her way.
She not only accommodated the oil change, power steering fluid but also retorqued the chain.
She couldn’t honor the expired goodwill discount from Subaru but provided other available discounts.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1538588732558, 'text': 'Thanks for the great feedback.'}</Response>< Gmap_id>

Service rep was out of office day of car pick up. No one could explain what had been done to vehicle. The fact the vehicle had been there an entire week and had the transmission replaced a second time in 3 months (fully covered under warranty). Not until I asked to speak with supervisor or mgr did a person provide some insight.

Not a good experiment at dealer, yes with Subaru covering all expenses a second time

This last fact was lost on everyone there</review>

I had a good experience I mentioned the online sale (they didnt) and I was able to get the car with premium upgrades as the VIN # was listed in ad. My only concern now is there supposed to pay off the last month of my 3 year lease so if that happens and I don't get a bill in the mail then I'll definitely change to 5 stars. I liked my salesman too, just do research ahead of time and print and specials and bring with you. They had a lot of great cars in stock ready to go.<//text>< pictures>

Didnt like the service or attitude with regards to trying to make a deal with a car that has deficiencies.  It seamed like a take it or leave it attitude from the salesman. Poor service. I will go somewhere else to buy a car.<//Text>

<Review>This place is so great that I get excited to have my car serviced. The staff is incredibly friendly (consistently, every time), and the interior is a WeWork-esque coworking space for you to work, drink coffee and generally reflect on your pleasant experience while you wait.

I'm going to keep buying Subarus if it means continuing to come here. Thanks Frank!<//Review>< Time>

Frank Subaru's Service Department is beyond excellent.  They have taken great car of our 2005 Forester.  You must ask for Catherine Tozier-Stotts if you want top notch service.  Catherine knows your car's needs, has in-depth understanding of the dealership and will never ever take advantage of you like most dealerships do.<//text>

Catherine did an amazing job at getting the service of my forester done by going above and beyond her way.
She not only accommodated the oil change, power steering fluid but also retorqued the chain.
She couldn’t honor the expired goodwill discount from Subaru but provided other available discounts.</Text>

<rating>4</rating><Text>It is far too difficult to make an appointment at Frank now.  All their appt times are booked online for months, call and call and no one in service picks up, had to chat - took 20 min - to get an appt.  I bought my car here and I’ve liked them, honest and trustworthy, still are, but they’re getting big and they can’t manage service appointments very well, and it’s too difficult to reach the right representative to assist with a simple service request... and 2 hours for an oil change is insane.  To Frank: please don’t get too big despite yourselves, you were a great dealership when you were small, but working with your team is becoming tedious.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great service. Very accommodating. Our situation was made more complicated by the car being in California and the contact person being in Virginia. They were exceptional in their flexibility and willingness to help. Victor Robles and John-Thomas were not only helpful but kind to my daughter who was going through her first repair situation, warranty issue and recalls all simultaneously while 3000 miles from home and over the thanksgiving holiday week.  If there were 6 or 7 stars to give them they would deserve that and more!!!!  Thank you.</Review>

<review>Frank Subaru is definitely the place to go. I was on the fence on getting a new car & had every intent just to get info and make the best financial decision for our family. What was great about Frank Subaru was they weren’t pushy at all and even with being transparent about just gathering info they were so helpful. All the credit goes to our Sales Rep, Arturo Camarena. He was absolutely phenomenal, patient, and always available to answer all of our questions big or small. He helped my wife and I feel very comfortable during the difficult process of buying a car and we trusted him that he had best interest in mind. We did have a bit of a hiccup during our visit, but working with the GM, Michael & Arturo, they handled everything both professionally and promptly; more of a reason as to why we went back and wanted to do business with Frank Subaru. We are very happy with our new Forester & highly recommend Arturo and the Frank Subaru team!</review>< rate>

<Review>As always, the folks at Frank Subaru were great. Service is thorough and they have, in the two years since I’ve owned my Outback, always finished earlier than the estimated time. That’s a definite plus since I always wait for my car in the comfortable lounge complete with USB ports that allow me to stay connected to my work while I wait. Plus, chai lattes to keep me warm!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><user>109419034605590524494<//user><response>{'time': 1555002980793, 'text': 'Thank you for writing this great review!

Friendly sales & administrative staff, bought my car here due to them being the Costco Car buying program location. Only negative thing I can say is that the finance manager was pushy about the up sells (special wax, extended warranty, under coat protection, Etc.). I told her at the start of our meeting that I was not going to purchase anything more which upset her.  When I told her I wouldn't be financing the car from them she got further upset. Stick to your budget when you go in to see the finance manager.< /review>

<Text>I worked with Arturo at Frank Subaru and purchased a certified pre owned Impreza. He was very informative and helpful. At the beginning I wasn’t sure on what I wanted, but he helped me to make the right choice over the course of a few days. He did not pressure me at all to make a purchase and gave me all the time I needed to make the right choice. I would recommend Arturo and Frank Subaru to anybody looking to purchase a new vehicle, even if you aren’t sure on what you want yet. They have a massive inventory and the dealership is beautiful.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1552952895959, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write this great review!

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I went there this afternoon for my 2019 crosstrek recall. My appointment  is at 1:45PM. I arrived way earlier than my time. However, my service advisor Brian. He is really helpful and super friendly to me even this is my first time visit this dealership. During the service I went to showroom just look around the car they display. One of there manager came to me, I told him my subaru is doing service right now I just look around. He was really kind and tell me that it is fine. If I want to test drive it, he can grab one for me. I will recommend this dealership to all my friends whoever drive the subaru or consider purchase a subaru. Appreciate both sale and service department for giving me such amazing experience today.</text>< pics>

Beautiful new building!  They have a great selection of cars, and they work hard for your business.  Great family business with a long history on the Mile of Cars.  I recommend them, and all of the Frank Motors dealerships.< /text>

This is by far the worst experience I’ve had purchasing a vehicle . When I first purchased my 2015 Nissan Sentra from a car salesman who had no idea what he was doing I should have known . He barely let me test drive the vehicle down the street . When I left the lot the car was already showing signs of transmission failure . A week later nothing wrong . Take it in to the mechanic they tell me wait until the check engine light comes on ? Fast forward to putting a few miles on the car mind you it never drove smooth they tell me the transmission needs to be replaced. Luckily I bought an extended warranty otherwise I would have been out over 4 k . They had me without a vehicle and decided to put me into one . A week later my car is done and what happens next ? The check engine light come son AFTER they supposedly fix the issue . So now it will just be me having to deal with a vehicle that does not properly work and I am out 17 k . I wish people operated more ethically and not sell single hard working moms a lemon. You figure you go to a well renowned dealer you expect cars to be good but one must learn the hard way and I never recommend this place to anyone .UPDATE: 6/29 My car has been in the shop 3 more times for various issues . Growing all too familiar with the staff; who are good at alleviating the frustration of having to constantly take care back in for repairs. Moral of the story : go elsewhere ...not worth the risk with so many other dealers on the strip.<//Text>

I got my car back sooner than expected . Only recommendation is if they can have the rental car delivered to the Subaru location . I had 3 kids with me , one being a toddler that needed a car seat and I had to walk across the street to get the rental and drive back to Subaru to pick up my car seat to place in the rental car . That was hard with 3 kids .</Text>

This is on regards to FRANK HYUNDAI/FRANK USED MOTOR VEHICLES. The service/experience I have received from this place has been literally the worst. The financing department has offered some support for an issue that shouldn't be an issue this long after having my car (keep reading to know the issue).... BUT the auto service department sent me to another dealership to get my car looked at, they did not provide any support and the young lady manager said to me that they do not provide temporary loaner vehicles to any customer getting their car serviced at their establishment, that being their vehicle makes (Hyundai) or other used vehicles. I am currently a student in a Navy enlisted medical program and having to deal with car issues is incredibly frustrating/inconvenient. I would think a dealership would offer much more support and better customer service to customers spending close to 30k on a car or even more, especially if it's putting money in their pockets.
That's the concern at the moment, I also had/STILL have an issue with registration, I got cited due to their professionalism/negligence in their job to ensure the resgistration process was done accordingly. The customer should always leave with no questions, comments, concerns or forthcoming issues, all I left with this dealership(s) was a VERY BAD TASTE customer satisfaction.
Hopefully other people or military members don't get the same kind of service from this dealership as I did.</review>

Better than most Subaru’s pricing but still to expensive
Great cars
I hate dealerships with a passion, they always try and over charge! I’m needing and oil change and tire rotation and they will charge you for both as separate services even tho this is a service protected by California law ! $115 ish to have oil and tires rotated ! This is the biggest rip off, 90% of oil change facilities rotate your tires at no extra cost or they include it in their oil change price as it’s a necessary process in the maintenance schedule and the perfect timing to get both jobs done! Go somewhere else for such basic service and save yourself hundreds a year! $65 for oil change at evens tires included tire rotation!<//text>

I bought a new Forester through costco auto program with Franksubaru. It was a very relaxing buying experience, my saleman Francesco and Jackie from financing both are very helpful. They stayed so late that night to help me out with the purchase. Really appreciate that and will definitely come back in the future.< /text>

< Review>
I recently purchased a 2020 Subaru Outback Premium from Frank Subaru. I worked primarily with Alex Barajas throughout the process, then James Mullen towards the end. A couple things stood out to me throughout the process:

- Alex was respectful, helpful, and informative from day one. He helped me onsite when I had questions, worked with me for the test drive, and was communicative with additional questions via text and email.
- I only worked briefly with James but he was very professional, helpful, and to-the-point. I would love to work with him again.
- Frank Subaru provided a very seamless experience for me from start to finish and gave me the best deal. During my research and test drives, I worked most closely with Kearny Mesa Subaru, El Cajon Subaru, and John Hine Mazda. Ultimately, Frank's was my choice for this purchase and has earned my business going forwards.</Review>

<Review>2016 WRX Premium needed to have a clutch adjustment and 36000 mile service. Tech did a great job as the car ran smooth like butter. They bled the clutch line and the clutch feels a lot lighter compared to before. My service rep, Catherine, was awesome.....very friendly, great personality and made you feel welcome. Is there a way I can request her next time I come in for a service?
I’ve had nothing but great service from everyone I’ve interacted with from the sales force, to the parts department, cashiers and Catherine. 5 stars to Frank Subaru and their great staff.</Review><Name>Joker SD</Name><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>The facility was recently remodeled and has the capability to easily service numerous cars on a busy weekend. Their waiting area spacious and free water, tea, and coffee via Starbucks machine are readily available. There’s free wi-fi for work or just browsing if you choose to wait for your vehicle. If not, there’s a complimentary shuttle service. Also, you can get a pet ID made for free while you wait and there’s a mini area for dogs outside. The service staff always makes it a point to call and give an update if my vehicle is done with its service or if there may be a minor delay and provides an explanation if this occurs.

Highly recommend this dealership for service.<//review>< userid>

<user_name>Ran Diego< /user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><Pics>None< /Pics><text>Great customer service from the Service department. My service advisor, Catherine, was very helpful in making me understand the repairs needed for our Forester and she gave me updates while I was waiting in the customer waiting area.

The girl at the cashier window (she had a very unique name, which I sadly forgot) was also top-notch. I had a slight hiccup in my payment method and she was very patient in helping it get resolved.

I've visited the other Subaru dealership in Kearny Mesa and they are not as good as Frank's.

I've also had an online chat experience with the dealership in El Cajon and after giving them information on my service and parts needs, as well as my personal information (phone and e-mail), they never gave an answer. Instead, I received a call from sales. No bueno!

If you're looking to service your Subaru, I would recommend Frank Subaru over all the other Subaru dealerships in San Diego.</text>< Date>

The dealership is impressive from out outside as it is in an architecturally striking building.  The service department has 3 service drives to accommodate the continual flow of vehicles scheduled for service.  John-Thomas Loss, the service advisor who checked my vehicle in, was knowledgeable and  was able to easily address some concerns my wife had. The customer waiting area is immense, with a large seating area for those who want to watch TV, another for those who don't, an area with plugs and USB ports for those who want to work (or just charge their devices) and finally a children's play area.  Service was accomplished promptly.  Even though I did not purchase my vehicle at Frank everyone I encountered treated me like a valued customer.< /Text></record>

So mad I got a vehicle here. I'm finding stuff out about my car a year after getting it because the salesperson couldn't answer questions about it and explained absolutely nothing about the vehicle to me. I will never buy Subaru from the experience from this place. I wish I could return my vehicle just so this place could not have business. I've heard more honesty from shady mom and pop dealerships. Thought a big name like this could afford some integrity.< /text>

Great service.
The BEST car buying experience I've had.
They let me look over the used car myself to make sure there was nothing wrong with it.
No pressure, very very friendly.
They let you actually test the car, no 3 corner test drive, they let you take the car out for a good 15 minutes to see if you really like it.
They worked with me to take the car home and I would reccomend anyone to this dealer. I would buy every Subaru I ever own from them if I could.

They were very helpful and since me being a younger person, they did not dismiss me like in other places. I felt more comfortable in there than in other dealers. Thank you for the experience.

Need more people to answer phones when calling to schedule service. I had to call back numerous times before connecting with someone in the service department.

The service department has great customer service. I was concerned that a scheduled shuttle from Subaru wasn’t going to occur. Was initially told that I’d have to wait for 2 hours.
They took care of me and I truly appreciated it.

The unfortunate thing that did occur was after having a couple of recall items addressed I’ve now experienced problems with my radio, map and AC. It’s strange. I just made another appointment today.</review>

<date>1555376339059</date><text>Called Kearny Mesa Subaru and left three messages to get service repair on a recall.  No response, no help.  I googled Subaru dealerships near me and found Frank Subaru in National City and spoke with a service adviser named Brian.  He explained the entire situation and process.  He set me up with a date.  They will even offer a courtesy car rental through Enterprise no charge for the 8 plus weeks that it might take to repair the car.    Brian was forth coming about the difficult situation and the bottlenecks and delays but completely honest and HELPFUL.  I should have called them sooner.  I like how they conduct themselves.</text></record>

<review>i wouldnt recommend this dealership.. i just went there with full intentions of purchasing a new wrx sti. after test driving i wanted to see how much i would get for my trade in.. trade in value kbb sets at fair price of 6500.. they offered me 5000 , of which i owe 4500 on the vehicle, coincidence? ha. and not to mention they tried to sell me the car at sticker price not even attempting to bring the price down. like are they forreal right now? they could have easily sold a new vehicle tonight but their greed lost that sale. to sum it up they had me set to pay 42500 dollars for a base model sti. not even close to being worth it. ill be going to another dealership to get a fair deal. sales girl was cool though.</review></record></dataset><record>

I have had my 2018 Forrester back multiple times for the same reason. We drive away from having had the car serviced and then a few miles later the same thing happens again. We are very unhappy. Either my car, with only 18,000 miles, is a lemon or Frank Subaru is incompetent.< /text>

I'm a fan of Subaru and own 3 Subarus:  1/ 2018 Impreza and 2
(2017) outbacks, but sad to say that I have been very dissapointed with my last 2 vehicles, the Electric System on the outback works whenever it feels llike it and of course when I take it to the dealer the liftgate which has been the main issue works well, but neither the garage door button nor the liftgate work 100% at all times and now the navigation System reads  "Unable to read map if necessary consultado your dealer" gladly but tryong to reach someone in service or get a all back is exhasuting...so far this morning 3 calls! so seriously thinking of moving to Toyota :(< /text>

<Review>What's the point of making an appointment to get a simple oil change done on your car when you're prioritized amongst any of the walk-ins for the day? Two and a half hours for a simple service with a scheduled appointment is horrendous. Frank Subaru is the worse when it comes to both sales and service. I only come here because it's the closest to my house. I eventually bought my car from Subaru Kearny Mesa because the sales manager at Frank literally drove us out of the dealership saying that he can no longer help us. Don't let the new building fool you. It doesn't make up for the second-rate service that they have within all aspects of their business here.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I came here to because of the reviews and to purchase a vehicle.  I had done A LOT of research including looking up safety features of different cars (that includes airbags, breaking systems, and headlights).   I went through my insurance agency to purchase the car through TrueCar (do not do this unless you want to be bombarded with phone calls).   Alas, I settled for a Subaru.  I drove into Frank Subaru on Wednesday 6/12/19, it was early in the morning.   A car sales person was standing in front of a white Subaru Crosstrek 2.0i Limited that I was eyeing.  He ignored me, said hello to my mom's friend (male) and my mother stated, "Oh my daughter is the one that is buying a car."  He made ridiculous small talk with my mom's friend.  Wasting time, just standing there.  There was no urgency, motivation, or even the passion of making a good deal with this guy.  He just looked us up and down and ignored us.  We decided to go inside to look for someone else that wanted to make a sale.  I mean, its a huge building, there HAS to be more than one salesperson.  I spoke to the girl in the front and she was trying to reach someone.  The guy had followed us in and was like, "I can help you."  We told him that we didn't want him as a salesperson.  He didn't have the attitude nor the motivation of even selling a car.  It was disappointing especially when we told him we wanted someone else and he said, "There is no one else."  So, we walked out and went to Kearny Mesa Subaru.  It's pretty packed but, man once I got off the car, a car salesperson approached us and shook our hands, acknowledged that we wanted to buy a car.  Showed us some cars, gave us the lowdown on what I wanted to purchase.  I mean, what a difference!  I don't want to make it personal but to be honest, that salesperson just lost you a bunch of money, Frank.  I bought that Crosstrek 2019 FULLY LOADED with EVERYTHING IN IT @  Kearny Mesa Subaru.   Just a warning you guys, to go to Frank Subaru at your own risk.<//Review>

<review>Service department it’s good, except they can’t seem to transfer you to the correct person you want to talk to. I was transferred to a customer that was also on hold to talk to a service representative. I continuously had to keep calling back because the call was constantly disconnected. And while I waited for my 13’ WRX while it was getting an oil change I decided to walk around and look at some new Sti’s and I looked at the ones on the show room floor and the ones outside and not a single person approached me or even asked me how I was doing or tried to sell me a car. I walked by multiple desk and made eye contact while looking at the sti’s and not one sales rep came to even say hello. Could’ve had a deal for sure if they could’ve convinced me to trade in my WRX for the Sti but since no one approached me I didn’t bother to even attempt to speak to any of the salesman due to the vibes they gave off.  Seems like they don’t even want to sale a car here. Other dealerships salesmen come out immediately when I first drive on the lot and just ask if they can help unlike here. Oh and I also realize that the “owner” only responds to good reviews and not that bad ones where the lack things or didn’t do something right.<//review>< pics>

I want to start off with the greeter was perfectly fine and the service advisor was Ok too. I wasn't too thrilled that they charged me $32 for them to remove 2 Rears lug nuts. Now I understand that the car had needs to be written up for it to be in the shop but then again I've worked in numerous shops and I've done favors for the advisors just to remove wheel locks...
Idk if I'm to happy about my experience... I guess it is what is it< /Review>

These people are FABULOUS!  I had gone to another dealership for years (they shall go nameless...but you can figure it out).  Last year I had to get the passenger air bag replaced.  The other place put me off for MONTHS.  Then Frank Subaru opened up and got me an appointment in 3 weeks, provided a rental car.  I just took it in for an oil change to their new building...in and out in under two hours.  Wonderful waiting area...lots of plugs for all my electronics gadgets.  RUN...don't walk to Frank Subaru!<//review>

Brought in a Subaru Forester (that I purchased at their dealership) due to a broken plastic piece in the overhead consul, creating a safety hazard due to the sunglasses holder hanging down in front of the rear view mirror - 26k miles, 3 years old, just a month out of warranty.  Piece was clearly poorly engineered - not abused, not due to excessive miles.  Refused to negotiate on a $50 piece, wanted to charge me full price, $229, to replace a part that should not have broken.  NOT EVER HAVING THEM SERVICE MY VEHICLE AGAIN, NOR WILL I BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM THEM!  Owned 2 Subaru's - and liked them both - they blew a future sale over a $50 part and 30 minutes of labor.<//Review>

The second time, I was getting a tire rotation they said they switched out my tires... but I knew one of my tires was newer and the nut to the tire was stuck and they didn’t say anything about it... until I said something to them about the tire sticking... then they wrote on the note it didn’t need to be switched out and just didn’t do the rotation... they also messed up some paint chip scratches on my car with their car wash...

Recently purchased Sienna Limited 4WD used veh from Frank Suburu with a missing key fob. Paid full asking price. Salesperson conveniently said it would be cheap to get a replacement key fob from 3rd party shop. Ended up none of the 3rd party shops were able to replace the key fob, and had to dish out $600 more to purchase the additional key fob from the Toyota dealer.

Also got sold on buying vehicle “bumper-to-bumper” extended warranty, took the car to the Toyota dealer for a loose/shaky mirror, broken armrest, and none was covered under any warranty because they were “cosmetic”.  Toyota dealer wanted $2,000 to fix/replace the mirror assembly and $150 just to diagnose the armrest.

Not very satisfied with the purchase.<//Review>

i didn’t feel any pressure during my car purchase. All my questions we’re answered and it was the fastest car buying experience I’ve ever had.< /Review>

<text>Half a star for the service department The service department is terrible. The service manager is not a helpful person. They fixed one problem and created another problem for you and then try to charge on you. I really can not recommend you to go to this dealer for service. I originally dropped off my car to get the ecu replaced thus being covered by my warranty well two weeks later still now new ecu and now they're saying I need my engine harness re-wired well they're charging me 600 for that well I payed it had the parts ordered and now it's been another 6 days the car still isn't fixed also the so called service advisor never calls to tell me anything that's going on with the car never even bothers to call me when something goes wrong or anything I have to constantly call to see if they're even working on the car or wasting my time they didn't even give me a rental cause I'm 19 but that makes sense but I need my car but here they are taking their sweet time so much more to explain but this is enough worst place to get your car serviced</text>< user_id>

<Review>It was excellent as always, just that a customer and I wanted hot chocolate but the machine there no longer had that option (I’m not really a coffee drinker).Other than that, I had a great experience, everyone was so kind and willing to help me with any questions I had. Thanks Frank Subaru!!!</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
So upset with the cars they sell, husband bought a car that had an oil leak 3 days after he took it home. Since then the car overheated 4 times and we have had a crack in the block and had to make repairs. We have spent more money on the car then it's worth. Today again had to take it in the shop they said it's the turbo engine and repairs about $400-$700. No way are we ever buying from them again!< /review>

<Date>1581745504070<//Date><Rate>3< /Rate><Text>I went for the 6 months service and 3 recalls... everything went well except, the service folks did not fix the TPMS code that keeps coming up about every 50 miles, regardless of the tires pressure.

A bit disapointing on that end ... they just added air and let me go, now I got to make another appointment to get is fix... another day to fix something that should have been fixed last time.

There is always room for improvement I guess.< /Text>< pictures>

Very long waiting for buying a vehicle. I've heard very good feedback on Frank Auto Services in this area, but this specific location had unfortunate and continued excessive time delays.

This dealership doesn't deserve a high rating.  Staff was ok, but not great.  They've much to improve at this dealership.< /Text>

<text>Wouldnt recommend to visit for repair of anything. As a “certified” subaru dealership they should be able to identify the problem the car has. Which they couldnt and had to do that myself after I paid 150 for a check up and battery. Not worth it. Recommend working on your car yourslef with some common sense and google you could do what they cant and save yourself some money.</text>< Resp>

< Review>
Visited dealership for a recall issue.  Was told ahead of time it was likely that I would like be given a rental.  I called before I left for appt and confirmed that that was the case, so clearly I was not going to be a no show.  Appt was at 0945 and did not get my rental until 1135.  Had to be driven from National City to Coronado to get the rental by rental car company.  Frank should coordinate better with the rental car companies and ensure that vehicles are ready for customers they know are definitely showing up for an appt. Took longer than my worst doctor's appt!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>We feel welcome here whenever we bring our car for service. My only gripe is of they could provide loaner vehicles for regular services like Mossy does.
The new location is HUGE and has all amenities for waiting customers. The staff has always been friendly.
Well worth the long drive from North San Diego.
Could ding half a star for the shuttle service system which is somewhat ... inflexible.

Edit: Dealership usually deals with recalled cars so they get priority on loaners. For our last visit in March, which involved a repair, they had us hooked up with a loaner with Frank Toyota .< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great service provided by John, he explained all the details, personally made sure the technician go easy on the plasti dipped grill during wash. Kudos to John for outstanding customer service!
Clean, well maintained facility, wait time could be improved, close to 2 hours to do 6k service seems a bit excessive. Would recommend other Subaru owners to use this facility. Make sure you ask for John in service department, you won't be disappointed.

Update: Dec 2019 I brought my Crosstrek in for recall service, the service department took care of everything, work was done with great attention to detail. Big thanks to John in service department for finding and taking care of issues on my Crosstrek.

Update: April 2021 Brought in my Crosstrek for a scheduled maintenance. John and the team did a great job again. Always professional and friendly service.

Review is for service (don't know about sales). My Impreza has had GREAT service here, tho it's rarely needed. Waiting room clean, pleasant, (oddly loud coffee machine).  Staff very helpful, repairs reasonably priced, issues fixed quickly, NO upsales or pressure. Last visit I forgot electronics in back seat (despite staff's valiant attempt to remind me to clean it out); everything was there, untouched, next day. Honest people!  Budget rental a few blocks away, painless arrangement.< /review>

<Review>Found the exact Forrester we wanted on the internet at this dealer after searching for months. Hooked up with Nadia their internet  mgr. She made arrangements & we drove 3 hrs. to get there. Once there, we were  immediately greeted by 3 pleasant salesmen. Asked for Nadia, one of them went to get her while the others held open the doors. Nadia was pleasant & professional. She introduced us to Francisco. He was great. Got the car so we could drive it. Answered any questions, completed paperwork in a reasonable amount of time. Very good at his job. He took us to Edith in finance dept. She was wonderful, efficient & professional. Edith took us back to Francisco for delivery of the car. That man went over every inch of the car. Connected our phones & did the set up procedures on many features of this amazing car. Car was turned over to us freshly washed with a full gas tank. Best experience ever with buying a new car. Highly recommend this dealership & the wonderful knowledgeable employees. The owner must be a great person since they obviously adores dogs. Thank you all at Frank's Suburu Dealership.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Last weekend I bought a 2019 Subaru Crosstrek through the Costco Auto Buying program at Frank Subaru. The entire buying experience was the best I’ve ever experienced.

Just to add a little context, I have purchased over 15 vehicles over the years for personal and small business use so I’ve seen the good the bad and the ugly in buying a car.

I picked the car I was interested in online on the Costco site and they connected me to Ilse Lara at Frank Subaru. My cell phone literally rang 30 seconds after I hit send. Ilse paired us with Briana Fifer to test drive our pick. I say paired because it was more like a team on a mission rather than the typical adversarial arm wrestling that goes with buying a car.

We took an extended test drive informed by a full day of reading consumer reviews about the Subaru Crosstrek. The Crosstrek passed with flying colors as did Briana as she answered a ton of questions from us about the car.

Even though I went with a check and a pre-approved car loan from my credit union, Edi in the finance office of the dealership shopped around and found me a better interest rate.

When all of these things came together I was able to upgrade two model levels to a loaded Crosstrek.

I could go on and on about how great this dealership is and how awesome the Costco Auto Program is but you probably get the picture.

I cannot believe how rude and unprofessional the used car sales manager Fred was right from the get go. We were being helped by a nice salesman and than he came along and switched out our guy we had been working with for about an hour already. This was all because the car was off of that lot even though another manager told our salesman that it was ok to take care of us.
The way he handled the switch was completely unprofessional and rude. The salesman he gave us was not easy to talk to at all and so Fred pretty much had to do everything, come to find out a couple,months later that his info about some things were WRONG. When I called about it to try and figure what could be done about my, "free servicing" which we were told by him could be done ANYWHERE, I was hung up on before the end of the conversation, mid sentence!!! I couldn't believe it!! I know we both asked this question because we live in Los Angeles. So, I called back, asked to speak to the owner who was not in and so was sent to the guy just below him. I got his voicemail and left a voicemail about what had happened, asked to be called back. Never received a call back or anything.
I've had better customer service when I've bought vehicles from a private seller! Un-real!!!
I suggest that if you are considering a Subaru, go somewhere else!! They don't care about the customer, they care about making the sale and not taking care of you after the sale. Especially when they were completely in the wrong and lie straight to your face.< /Text>

Found the exact Forrester we wanted on the internet at this dealer after searching for months. Hooked up with Nadia their internet  mgr. She made arrangements & we drove 3 hrs. to get there. Once there, we were  immediately greeted by 3 pleasant salesmen. Asked for Nadia, one of them went to get her while the others held open the doors. Nadia was pleasant & professional. She introduced us to Francisco. He was great. Got the car so we could drive it. Answered any questions, completed paperwork in a reasonable amount of time. Very good at his job. He took us to Edith in finance dept. She was wonderful, efficient & professional. Edith took us back to Francisco for delivery of the car. That man went over every inch of the car. Connected our phones & did the set up procedures on many features of this amazing car. Car was turned over to us freshly washed with a full gas tank. Best experience ever with buying a new car. Highly recommend this dealership & the wonderful knowledgeable employees. The owner must be a great person since they obviously adores dogs. Thank you all at Frank's Suburu Dealership.< /review>

FS replaced the radio/touch screen entertainment center under warranty due to some funky behavior. The factory put the wrong radio in the right box/labels. FS kept my Outback and I has to drive a rental Corolla for almost a week. A similar rental, like a RAV4 or FJ Cruiser would have been nicer. Correct radio was installed the second time.< /Text>

<date>1539283429566</date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Last weekend I bought a 2019 Subaru Crosstrek through the Costco Auto Buying program at Frank Subaru. The entire buying experience was the best I’ve ever experienced.

Just to add a little context, I have purchased over 15 vehicles over the years for personal and small business use so I’ve seen the good the bad and the ugly in buying a car.

I picked the car I was interested in online on the Costco site and they connected me to Ilse Lara at Frank Subaru. My cell phone literally rang 30 seconds after I hit send. Ilse paired us with Briana Fifer to test drive our pick. I say paired because it was more like a team on a mission rather than the typical adversarial arm wrestling that goes with buying a car.

We took an extended test drive informed by a full day of reading consumer reviews about the Subaru Crosstrek. The Crosstrek passed with flying colors as did Briana as she answered a ton of questions from us about the car.

Even though I went with a check and a pre-approved car loan from my credit union, Edi in the finance office of the dealership shopped around and found me a better interest rate.

< Review>
My wife and I bought our first brand new car in over 15 years recently from Frank Subaru. After a really bad experience at "Subaru of El Cajon", talk about high pressure salesman who try and guilt you with the whole "nobody else can get you a car like we can" . We decided to visit Frank and try and keep our business local,  being from National City. It was the best decision we could've made, from the get go our salesman Francisco was nothing but polite, respectful and best of all very attentive. Keep in mind it took about 2 weeks and several visits to the dealership before we reached a deal that was great for us as a family. Through the whole process, there was NEVER!!! any pressure/cold calling or anything like that. They were very patient and easy to work with. It was reassuring when the general manager took the time to ask me what we were trying to get, he then worked with my salesman and we got it done. I've had the car serviced there now twice since our purchase and even though there was a slight hiccup with our second visit, I let them know and again the general manager stepped up to the plate. He got me in touch with there service manager Ondur and within 24 hours he was personally waiting for us in service department and made everything right with excellent attention to detail.  I'm glad I waited 7 months after purchase to give review because I was really able to gauge the level of customer service at Frank Subaru. If you're in the process of purchasing a Subaru I highly recommend you visit these guys first and save yourself from predatory salesman waiting to pounce on their next victim. Thank you Ron, Francisco, Ondur and the entire staff at Frank Subaru for an excellent experience so far. Easy to give 5 stars.<//Review>

<username>CCA< /username><review>Arturo C. was my rep. and was extremely great. I couldn't believe I was at a car dealer on the Mile of Cars. Brutally honest and extremely knowledgabe. I went in on a whim to get my wife a birthday car she wanted: outback and I waited too late, so I thought. Just 2 days away and Arturo made it an absolute pleasure and speedy at that. Checked out all the subaru reviews but this place had the best. Now, the negative ones I could read throught them, there are whiners in every crowd. Honestly didn't see or pick up on anything negative in fact from what I seen they are pretty much a crack team. I look forward to going back for maintenance or needed repairs. I'm sure it won't be iPhone quick like many bad reviews complained about and I won't expect everyone to stop what they are doing just to attend to me since others will be getting repairs too. Many thanks Arturo!!!! My wife really loves the car.< /review><Rate>5</Rate><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

My experience with frank Subaru today left me frustrated and my car with issues still unresolved. I called yesterday morning to see if they could squeeze me in to drop off my car , I have been experiencing a sound that happens on cold start ups. Something that I have actually had it serviced for before at this location which turned out to be a bad gasket .  I was very happy  when they told me I would be able to come in at 7am, drop my car off and provide me a loaner so I could make it to work on time. I got there at 730 ( I was a little late) when I  came into the service department they could not confirm my appointment . When I met with the service advisor, I explained the issues I was having and how it had been in before for the same issue. I explained it’s unlikely he would be able to hear the issue unless the engine is cold... he proceeded to turn on the engine and then stated to me he couldn’t hear the noise ... he then told me I would need to wait around for at least two hours so they could see if they hear the noise . I explained that I had Set up an appointment and I was told previously that a loaner car would be available for me and if they didn’t find a problem then they would simply charge me a days rental, which is completely fair. He finally told me that he could set me up with enterprise rental car. Being on a time crunch I had to pass simply  because I couldn’t  invest additional time at the service counter and the rental counter , I was trying to be quick, thats why I made an appointment..I left feeling like I was being portrayed as a liar. I would be more understanding of the service departments decision if it wasn’t for the fact that I’ve had the same problem and had taken it in  before and the additional fact that it took two trips originally to get the issue fixed because they couldn’t hear the noise the first time and didn’t believe me. I  now have an issue with my car and with the holiday coming up I’m worried I won’t have it looked at for another week.<//Text>

Awesome sales experience. From the onset, we had a great experience with Diana at the National City Blvd. she was incredibly knowledgeable and delightful explaining all the options and helping us get the best for our budget. I recommend her highly. So call and book your appointment with her. Subarus have an excellent package for leases and I am coming from severe annoyance from Chevrolet! I can't wait to give back my Cruze and pick up one of these babies. FYI my sister got the crosstrek! Excellent ride all round!< /Text>

<Text>Buying a car for your teenage son is not easy.  And the balance between safe/reliable and affordable can be hard to find, but we found it at Frank Subaru!  From the moment we walked on the lot we experienced the "white glove" treatment from Marco Vazquez and his team.  He was attentive and helpful without forging any pressure.  Once we decided on the car, making the deal was easy and effortless.  We felt comfortable and very much taken care of.  Frederick Beraud and Edtih Loya, who assisted in the sale, confirmed we had made the right choice with Frank Subaru.  If you are in the market for a new or used car, I highly recommend saving yourself the time, anxiety and trouble of shopping around and make Frank Subaru (or any of the Frank Motors Group dealerships) your one stop source.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80d95212f409b72d:0xd568cfc83045d35< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Service adviser John Loss is great at what he does. He is attentive and sensitive to customer's needs. the new facility is big, nice and definitely efficient. I even got a small discount for my previous oil change and tire rotation service to compensate for service being late (i was attended to 15 mins after my appointment time-- really not a big deal on my part but i took the discount of course). I won't hesitate to come back here<//review>< Resp>

Worst experience ever buying a car. the entire staff is incompetent and the GM is no were to be found. Mixed up all of our paperwork and when we decided to finally return the car they kept our deposit. It is literally impossible to get a hold of someone to talk to. This place is a mess.<//Text>

We bought our last Subaru about four years ago at Frank Subaru from Fernando Rascon; we went today to buy another Subaru from Fernando. There is plenty noteworthy about Frank Subaru, but the two most noteworthy aspects are Fernando Rascon and the service department. Frank Subaru is not the closest dealer to us by a long shot. In fact, there is a dealership down the road that I could practically walk to, but Fernando Rascon is one of those gems of a salesperson and he works at Frank - so that's where we go. He knows his stuff about cars, especially Subarus, listens and helps you figure out what you want; I appreciate also that he isn't high pressure. He is diligent and follows up but is not intrusive. He is the reason we drove thirty minutes today to buy a car instead of going to any number of closer dealerships. As I mentioned, their service department is also excellent. After purchasing our Outback about four years ago, we used Frank service a couple of times and then for convenience we tried our local super close Subaru dealership shop - nope; we were back at Frank for our next service even though getting there is a hassle. They are that good, that responsive, that competent. They stand out! We will use them for our new Subaru as long as there is a need for dealership servicing. Again, thanks Fernando for yet another pleasant, smooth car buying experience.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Last year I bought a new 2012 WRX from them. I found them using truecar and they were offering the best price and a car fresh off the boat with no miles on the odo(and some packing material still attached). Since then I have added multiple modifications having them put on some of the more dicey ones. I highly recommend them as a good mod friendly dealer.<//Text>< pictures>

The worst experience with the service department I have ever had. I took my Subaru BRZ to them that had some seatbelt alarm issues. They took $99.00 for the diagnostics and told me that they will be done after 2 hrs. I come back 2.5 hours later and the technician has not even started. They were stating that they got bucked up with other work although I had made the appointment with them earlier. I left my car for another day and the technician requested $99.00 more to look for the problem. I am planning to pull out my vehicle and never return to this dealership.</Review>

Horrible customer service they smile they laugh but after you buy you will never get anything fixed on your car, extended warranty or not. If you want a BRZ don't get it from here.</review>

Dealership is a joy to walk around, grab a coffee and hang out at the dog park while you are here. All the staff that I dealt with were friendly. The salesmen aren't like other dealerships where they stalk you and constantly pressure you. Instead here, they just answer any questions you have until you are ready to make a decision.<//Text>
