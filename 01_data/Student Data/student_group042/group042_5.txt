<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Good service, great pizza, especially for the price. The staff are usually friendly & fast. This particular location is also near a Safeway & a Walmart, so you can grab extra fancy toppings to add to your pizza nearby if that's your sort of thing.

I would highly recommend ordering ahead on their website, not only to skip much of the wait, but also because they tend to have coupon codes you can take advantage of.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<time>1581736708837</time><Rate>3</Rate><Text>Staff is always friendly and the store is always clean. The food is always delicious. However this is not the first (or second) time my order was wrong...
Today I ordered half cheese with red sauce and half gourmet veggie with creamy garlic sauce. I picked up my pizza and the sauce was half and half, but the whole pizza had the veggie toppings. They offered to remake it and I said no, I don't want the pizza to be thrown away, I can just move the veggies to one side. The staff assured me the pizza would not be wasted so I agreed to wait again for a remade pizza.
After 10 minutes my remade pizza was ready. It was more like 70/30. And the price for the whole pie is the more expensive half. I did not want to wait a third time so I took it home.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH3nwnFQYfdDM3eTmgnqv7eAwxD4duWtzv9bNS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I stop here every once in a while because of the double stuffed pizzas, but the customer service is atrocious. The first time I encountered the girl at the register (I truly wish I had paid attention to name tags) I assumed maybe it was a bad day, but after several encounters with her and now seeing her manager treat another customer like dirt in front of the whole store, I've realized that they are just rude people who don't care about their store's image or their customers. I do apologize to any employees of this establishment who treat customers with respect.< /Review>< pics>

Called our order in, the phone service was a little snappy and the gal was short. However, she took our order accurately, and we always enjoy our pizzas from this restaurant.< /review>

The service is friendly, quick, and efficient. They are very fastidious when it comes to Covid precautions. The food is great and we've never been disappointed. We're regular customers and 45 minutes away, but they're worth the trip.</Text>

Papa Murphy's Murphy's make their own pizza and they're very very good. They also make salads and they also do cheese bread and salads and they have a cookie dough and chocolate chip dough and drinks. Staff is very friendly. I went later tonight and there was only one staff working but she certainly knew how to put out the pizzas and do her job she did excellent. I need to get her name though. Try it you'll like it</review>

Thin blond haired younger lady at this location was extremely rude. I ordered a pizza and when I went in to pick it up she practically tossed the pizza at me as I said thank you. She completely ignored the thank you and turned away from me. Living up on the hill im pretty put off when I receive undeserved rudeness especially in such a quaint little town. On the other note the pizza was ok.<//Text>

I ordered online, specifically choose a Cowboy, then added extra pepperoni, green onions, white sauce and chopped garlic. What I received is a white sauce, single pepperoni and green onions, absolutely nothing else. When my wife calls to complain, she is told that the person making the order didn't see the rest. So I go down personally, and take the messed up pizza with me, and show the exact order as confirmed to me both online and in an email confirmation, both of which list EVERY item to be on the pizza, and the supposed manager makes an excuse that the person making it "didn't see the order as a Cowboy, but only saw the add-ons" (major attitude as well), and shows me the order tag that they printed, which PLAINLY says COWBOY and goes on to list the added ingredients. So, I ask is the person not able to read? And then I get accused of being rude and degrading.....<//Review>

The thing that really brought this score down was the fact that i called in my order and they told me it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. It ended up taking them a full hour and fifteen minutes after i called to make it. Needless to say i was not happy about that.</review>< name>

<text>Amazing customer service! I went to Best Buy Auto Sales and was so impressed. They were so kind and professional, they even brought the car to my job for I could view it (wow). When I returned to get my new car they were so courteous and helpful, they assisted me with trading in my car and driving off the lot bin a new one without any hassle. If you are out looking for a new or used card look no further then Best Buy Car Sale.<//text><user_name>KeKe Truitt<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Gino is a complete blessing I'm a single mother who is in college and work full time. My old car was consistently breaking down. I called around and I could not find anyone to finance a car, so found Gino and he was patient to answer "ALLL" my questions and he didn't rush through anything even the paperwork. If you need a car I highly recommend him. He is considered a close friend of mine. I'm truly blessed to have found him.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I spent all day at the car lot this was not the first lot i came across but it was the last one i ended at. They were nice and pleasant they were understanding to my needs and was trying to help me it took a long time but they didn't give up until they found someone willing to trust me and i thank them for that. I'm enjoying my 2006 Ford Expedition<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Yes I know it’s a little read but if you’re considering a car from here it’s so worth it.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE! RUDE OWNER! Thought I would give this place a chance considering the majority of the poor reviews are dated somewhat back. I already researched about the vehicle I was interested in, reading the carfax and learning everything about it. I even called ahead before driving the 200 mi down there and ASKED if I could get the recall on the car inspected, which they had no issue with. Fast forward a few days to where I actually went to the lot looked at the car and asked if there was anything wrong with it if it had any recalls. The salesman told me it runs great and has no recalls. I asked about the tank deformation recall which he suddenly remembered. It was listed for the sale price of $7,595. Asked if I could talk about pricing and that’s when I met the owner. I told him I would be paying all cash upfront but if we could talk about the price because not only did it have the recall but problems with the transmission clutch shuttering. He was VERY SHIFTY (like other reviews mentioned). He pulled up the carfax on the computer, pointed the screen to me somewhat and was saying how good the vehicle is and it’s a great vehicle. I mentioned how I found those issues on the carfax before coming here and know about the reoccurring issues I just wanted to see if we could agree on a price. He said we will play with the numbers and find something out. I mentioned how I would like to take the vehicle into Future Ford there in Sacramento (8 min drive from Gino’s) to get a FREE inspection on the recall. I told him how FORD would only measure the gas tank to see if this specific car had the recall issue because not all vehicles are affected when recall stated. He said that would be ok and he will get the key and pull it out. I told him I would be right back that my mother and I had to go to our vehicle real fast to grab our phone so we could have directions sense we are not from here. WHEN WE GET BACK HE STATES HOW HE NO LONGER WANTS TO SALE US THE VEHICLE! We were nothing but nice the entire time. We were pretty shocked at this considering we just agreed to $8,200 out the door if the recall didn’t effect the car. It seemed more as if he really knew the issues and if we were to go and get it inspected it would of had the issues they first claimed it didn’t have. PLEASE RESERACH YOUR VEHICLE IN EVERYWAY POSSIBLE AND DONT LET THESE PEOPLE FOOL YOU!!!!!<//Review>< pictures>

Gino was awesome and very helpful when I got my car from him. He made my car buying experience stress free. If you are looking for a good quality used car, you should go and visit his car lot at Fulton avenue and you will be well taken cared of. Cheers!</text>

First time buying a vehicle, I ran into a lot of problems due to my credit and income but the best buy guys didn't give up and found me an Excellent deal and affordable payments, so now I get to drive away in my new to me 06 escape! Very excited and satisfied I'd definitely recommend to anyone having issues with finding a place to finance or even buying right off the lot. Very honest guys!<//text>

<Text>I want to give a positive review for the owner and sales personal at Best Buy Car Sales.  The inventory is as advertised and they stand behind their cars.  I would encourage people to check out the vehicles and test drive before going any where else.  If you are interested in a great deal and quality cars give a best buy car sale a chance to find you and your family the Perfect Car

<Review>Excellent service. Wife and I went in and told them how much we had and they worked with us and drive off a few hours later. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a used car. Not pushing it breast like most used car salesmen. Will definitely go back next time I need a car.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate><Name>Jeremy Farris< /Name><user_id>105518701310137329154</user_id></record></dataset><record>

Recently purchased a 2008 Charger that I love! The process went smoothly and quickly after contacting a sales person (Vaso) via the Internet Sales. He found the car I wanted within the price I was willing and able to pay! Excellent Customer Service from everyone I dealt with!< /Review>

Gino Motors are Fantastic,  I couldn't get to his location,  he drove the 08 Toyota Highlander Hybrid that I saw on Craigslist to my home in Antelope,  We did the application, trade in, etc.right at my dinning room table. ! !
Now That's Customer Service.......
Great Staff, Gino is Awesome.
Thanks Again.

Gino is everything! He takes care of you and his team he has there is awesome. I bought a BMW 328i with really low miles on it and it runs like a champ. I've had no problems with the car and when I mess it up (like when I hit the curb, lol) Gino took care of me! I swing by just to hang out with him and check on the crew every now and then because their just that cool!<//text>

Had an issue getting the license plates but they resolved it within one day.

Came in looking for a vehicle to get my elderly mother and grandmother around. Met Angelina. She not only willing to work with me, she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  I just bought my 2006 Expedition for well under the bluebook value. It is the best car I have owned. Will never buy another car from anywhere else. Highly recommended.</review>

It has been 7 years since I bought a new vehicle and I wasn't looking forward to the process due to all the expenses as well as the typical hassle at car dealerships.  Best Buy Car Sale LLC. more than exceeded at making the overall process enjoyable.  I called this place in the morning inquiring about a 2004 black Nissan Pathfinder and they still had it available.  Not sure when I would get down there due to having no transportation other than a bicycle, Luis one of the associates there came all the way to my house to pick me and bring me back to the dealership.  Later he drove me to the bank as needed to help with the whole process.  I have never had better customer service than that.  All the guys here are very honest, friendly, and don't make you feel pressured like you do at so many car lots these days.

Having known my credit was not the greatest, they still worked with me to get approved and drive away in my new vehicle.  The pathfinder has been driving great and I can tell it will be a great reliable vehicle.  Outstanding service and Professional.  Highly recommended!! :)  Plus I got a piece of chicken when I was there which was pretty cool, haha,  They really know how to care of their guests which further acknowledges their award with BBB!< /review>

I wouldn't buy a glass of water from these guys.
Save your money.
Shop elsewhere.
Vehicles are tooled with enough to "pass smog" before they.. Don't
Buyer beware.
Not as nice and honest as they come off as.
3 month/3000 mile warranty is great if nothing happens by then.
But if it does, hope Sargon pays his end as I did.
Run don't walk from these guys< /text>

i came in and bought a car yesterday i was in and out within 45 minutes which is great because most car lots you will be there all day before you finally get a car. They were very friendly and great service i was playing around in my car trying to learn everything on it and i ended up locking it in 4 wheel drive and it got stuck i took the car back and they helped me unlock it right away i would absolutely go back next time im looking for a car</Review>

<Review>This is a very professional dealership. I bought a low milage Honda Accord from them last month which I found by a google search. Their description of the car was very accurate and did a thorough job during the sale process. I got this car at a great price and will definitely buy from them again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had been in the market looking for a good used truck. I went to 4 other lots and found a few trucks I liked but way over price. I saw a GMC Sierra on Gino's website. Called him and he stayed open late for me after I got off work. I was nervous to buy a used vehicle...like everybody I'm sure. Soon as I met Gino he was a straight shooter. He told me the truth, never tried to rush me and was completely honest about everything I asked about the truck.I can truly say this is a Man of his Word which is hard to find these days. I had horrible credit, he made sure i got approved and at a payment well below my expectation. A week later i found the fuel gauge was not working correct..sticking...not registering correct. Gino said bring it in and he replaced my fuel pump with no problem. I will refer everybody to Gino. Thank you Gino for taking care of me, Your a good man....see ya next time!!!< /review>

Needless to say the motor blew up and he robbed me! Never go to Gino's it is by far the worst rip off plus he has the worst employees that almost wrecked me on the car when I took it for a test drive!<//text><gmap_id>0x809ad99e643cbd0b:0x8a311775292025be<//gmap_id>< rate>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>first glance this place seems okay so i went to look at the Volkswagen and it was perfect on the outside and we were told it was running well. obviously we asked for a carfax and they only showed it to us on his computer screen when we asked for a print out Gino told us No not unless you buy the car. he seemed very shifty and restless and wouldnt even let us read it he was scrolling for us and he already ran our credit. will never go back and will not be recommending to anyone. i understand Gino has a business to run but ripping people off is not the way to go.the one star is for the co-owner who had a good convo with us but Gino is SHADY. so overall the place is SHADY. DO NOT GO THERE!!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Geno motors one of best dealer I have known since I bin driving about 47 years .and believe me I dealt with lots of dealer's in my life time but I never found dealer like geno motors the staff will treat you like a family and with respect like they know you for years.  And there vehicles are so clean and affordable you don't believe as my experience with this dealer made me write this this to share it with you. Go andask for geno he is the owner and he will help you himself and you will see watt I'm saying..Thank you for your time to read this and thanks to geno motors  keep up the good work...</Text>< Pics>

My parents were in search of a vehicle for my sister and we stopped at Gino motors and decided to go and look at more vehicles but no one was able to beat his price so we came back and purchased a Acura TSX and we just loved the hospitality that we received and the service he made us feel appreciated and highly recommend Gino Motors as your place to shop for your vehicle.</text>

<Review>I bought a 2006 audi from this place feb of 2016. Dont get me wrong very nice  people but not as honest as i thought speeding forward to the present i DO NOT have that audi anymore the transmission went completely out from the date i bought the car i had issues i even  gave it back to him to fix he kept it for almost a month and a half saying it was the computer and kept telling him it was  the transmission i got the car back and not even a month later same transmission issues i gave it back to him to fix again hes still  saying its the computer finally got it back again (remind you I'm  paying monthly on this car that  i don't have due to the fact that i kept giving it to him)  few more months go by BOOM transmission goes completely out i gave the car back oct 2016 now im stuck with a bill. Look else where people im furious i have to buy another car now and i had that one all of 4 months in my possession these people aren't honest AT ALL.< /Review>< name>

<response>None< /response><Text>I tried to buy a car thru craigslist private owner.  What a joke.  I found Gino on craigslist also and thought I would give it a try.  I called from SF because he had a van that looked up my alley.  I was definitely pessamistic after what I had been thru but I decided to drive to Sanramento after talking with Gino over the phone.  I am not sorry that I took the time.  I bought the van and he delivered my car to Daly City.  So far so good....Thanks Gino</Text>< time>

Lied about car not being a flood salvage, tire in the trunk was white from being submerged, water damaged interrio, mold and mildew, rust snd water stains on the interior.  I asked on phone before driving down, wasted an hour.  I would avoid because of the dishonesty.<//review>

This place caters to high volume bussineses. Alicia looked at a small pillow cover I had and emediatly turned us away without looking at type of texture we had. Horrible service. They should keep it 💯
Wholesale. Maybe Alicia was having a bad day and hope it gets better for her.< /review>

<text>Let me begin by saying that the food here is amazing. If you're looking for a good eat of either Mediterranean or Italian food, this is the place to go.

The reason why I won't give it 5 stars is because we were dying to eat pasta and when we arrived we were told that the restaurant only serves Mediterranean food before 3pm. So it feels like two completely different restaurants in one, wish they either had both menus all the time.

We ordered a the Brussels sprouts to start with and they were delicious! Very fresh and well cooked. Followed with a Shish Kebab plate which was good.

After that we got our pizzas and the Pizza Bianca was AMAZING, definitely a must try!

Our server which was also the host was very nice and attentive! The only thing I we didn't like was he wasn't wearing a mask and, even though the restriction has been lifted, we expect servers who are in come with food and drinks to wear a mask for a few more months. Just to feel more comfortable and sanitary.

The check arrived as a simple piece of paper. No leather cover or pouch which was kinda weird for a place like this.

Other than that service was fantastic, prices are Good, place is beautiful inside, food is delicious and overall a great experience minus a few details that could be easily fixed.

Looking forward to the next visit!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

It used to be Pappys Seafood?

The family packs look tempting. However, the restaurant was closed at 11:30 am on 2/2/21.< /Text>

Best food and best service! The waitress and owner really went above and beyond, and the food was amazing! We had the lobster ravioli and bruschetta-definitely recommend! We can't wait to go back!</text>

We had a great lunch today! Perfect fresh fish, great sauce, great fresh made pasta, great sides, and wonderful service!! Bravo, La Bocca Felice! I hope everyone visits them and supports them! I don't think you will be disappointed! And my mom loved the swordfish sandwich too!!</text>

I call order to go at 6:22 pm
She said food will be ready at 20-25 mins
we come pick up at 7:24
And she said need other 10mins
It's been more than hour for order togo food and we still didn't get the food

Do they busy inside or outside table... not at all
Only had 1/4 tables had people on

7:30 pm.... Food almost ready but not really ready</Text>

<user_id>100630193905782166405<//user_id><review>Dear Matteo, it's 6:10 Wednesday night and we were trying to order a few pizzas from you, but had a horrible experience with your phone staff. First they put us on hold for about 10 minutes, and clearly forgot us...then I called back to get an unacceptable reason why we were put on hold, then were told that the Bartender takes phone orders, and she put the phone down and not on hold.... and I eventually just hung up the phone! I don't think call in customers are any less important than Walk in customers....and I hope you train your staff to know that ANY customer is important to your business. Also your voicemail service is less than adequate... I'm sorry!</review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

We really appreciate that they were willing to cut the lock off.  Apparently we were supposed to take the lock with us when we moved out.  They told us later on that the lock was ours.  Thanks for cutting that lock for us!</Review>< pictures>

<Time>1578108780441</Time><rating>2<//rating><text>So it was our fault rented last minute. Closes way to early and way over priced.. Werent aware after special expired it would jump up to 170 plus a month and hours closing at 5-6pm people do work and get off at that time so hard to make it. And they dont pro rate their prices so have a to give a 2 wk notice or you get charged the entire month. Kind of ridicules</text>< Pictures>

Property Manager 'Kay' was very informative. She was super nice and answered question I never thought to ask. The process was a lot quicker than I expected (15min) The initial discount of 50% off was amazing. Looking around for several storage place this location off Story Road had the best prices in my opinion.</Review>

Kay is a really friendly property manager that explained all costs and policies about my first move. She explained the $1 1st month promotion and all my options including locks to buy and last move out date. I was able to access my storage after work until 9pm which is convenient. 1/23 was my move in date and I hope this is a successful storage experience. It has been pleasant so far!</Review>

I definitely give this storage facility 5 stars because of Kay, the manager. she is probably the most helpful, pleasant person I have personally met in the last few years. She truly wants to help you make your experience at Public Storage a positive one.
The facility is very conveniently located off Hwy 101 and is for the most part clean and seemingly safe. I found a very cheap rate for a 5x10 that is working out just fine for my business needs.
If you are on the fence, go for it.....this place is decent but the management is great!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Kay is perfectly courteous and professional. But the  maintenance person is outright disrespectful and sounds like he is mad of his life and not educated. He cranked up the door and put a brick on the restroom so i didnot close it thinking it might be down for a reason. There is  no person around. He yelled at me after I urinated in the bathroom without talking to me una nice manner. He was very mad like I made a big mistake. If I am his employer I will fire him out. He does not respect customers and talk to them like a thrash  like him. His name is Richard according to Kay. I opened an account today. And I will never open an account with public storage with this kind of ruthless and mad worker.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Kay is the property manager, very friendly and very helpful. She will make your life easier,  I did my reservation for one unit online and in about few hours I received a call from Kay, went to their office at 1500 storey road. She immediately processed and handles everything.during paper signing, she is very open. Letting you know about promotions, discounts and alternatives so you can save money. How wonderful is that. So you guys out there, if you need a storage, just ask or look for Kay. No body does it better other than Kay. More power to public storage. Keep up the good service.</review>

<Review>Review Public Storage
1500 Story Rd, San Jose, California 95122
Rate it

My name is Jose Cardenas, this review is written for Kay, manager of the Public Storage on Story Road in San Jose, California. I have had the opportunity to rent a storage unit there for approximately one year. Kay is a very kind and generous lady and very respectful towards me. She has never given me any bad or negative attitude. She and her husband Richard have been very helpful by giving me advice in which storage unit size would be in my best interest for the amount of belongings I have. I would be willing to rent a storage unit there in the future and would also recommend this Public Storage to my friends and family members. Sincerely, Jose Cardenas<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>We are new to Public Storage and had to visit several locations before landing at the perfect spot at the Story Rd location. Let me just say, all the other PS employees were helpful and friendly and ultimately propelled us to this facility. Then we met Kay who made the experience complete. Not only did she find us the best spot, she also had another choice which would have worked well for our situation, if needed. She made the process smooth, fast, and answered all questions with a smile. Thank you so much, Kay!<//Review>< pictures>

Kay is a wonderful person. I am currently renting a car parking space in public storage and she has always been very helpful. I got late the day I decided to park my car there and reached their office just before the closing time. I also had to catch the flight in next one hour so she stayed late in the office and also helped me to finish the paperwork quickly.</review>

I am being renting at this place for years. Clean and easy access. However, I would like to add few suggestions for the Managers to improve the storage as follow:
1> There are some construction nails left by other tenants on the facility's road which may puncture customers vehicles tires.
2> Some area of the facility is dark, extra light will provide safety and security to customers going in and out.
3> Please review video security camera more often to make sure that pictures video is clear in case to assist local authority to capture criminals, and to provide a safe place for customers while accessing their storage units.
Thank You very much.
Other than these 3 above suggestions, the place is great.<//Text>

< Review>
on 11-3-15  I went into this public storage  office to pay my bill and the lady working the front office was extremely rude and disrespectful for her  working with the public you would think that she would have a better attitude and know how to talk with people, i have only had my storage for a little over a month and was just in there a few weeks ago to make payment and did not have a problem or the  experience i had with the lady and gently men on 11-3-15 at about 4:59 pm i went in there to pay my bill and was accused of paying somebody else's storage with someone one else's credit card that i wasn't there to pay my own storage, i just came from work wearing my work uniform with my name  patch on my shirt, and when i told them the last time i was here i didn't have this problem and when i signed my name the lady and gently man told me to sign my real name and when i told them this is my real name they became verbally aggressive and threatened me not to come back on this property, i had my 14 year old daughter with me she was sitting in  my car waiting for me, when  the gently man follows me to my car and is still very aggressive and in my face, I asked him two back up and give me space, because  he was scaring my daughter and she was upset ,  I have never experienced anything like this just to pay my bill even if i was making a payment for somebody to be treated so badly. i hope that not all public storage's are like that one, the experience i had  was the most degrading, horrifying and humiliated experience for my daughter and I,  so for anyone looking for a storage place don't go to this one , they don't have a professional or friendly environment ....< /Review>

Please note that I have never been to a public storage thet treat you so nice.

<review>The ladies here are extremely helpful and accommodating!

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>If you want to apply or renew a passport at this location get there before 8:30 to wait in line. Once they hand out all of these official numbers (5-6) they are done for the day. Oh, they don't start seeing those with numbers promptly at 8:30. They begin whenever the official passport service provider is done doing their other post offices duties. So any other words, whenever someone has time to get to you. The office is pretty run down and there isn't many places to sit if you are disabled. If you need a photo it is $15. If you are renewing a passport, they won't help you and you'll have to mail it in if you're not renewing for a child.

If you need further information from postal workers, be prepared to pull teeth. After a seemingly easy process turned into a 3 day long endeavor, I spoke with many of the associates here and they all have very little information to give me concerning the process. You would have better luck actually attempting to torture the information out of them than wasting your time with trying to hold an informed conversation.

When it comes to quality, you wont find your hard earned tax dollars well spent here. If you can help it, try one of the few Passport acceptance locations elsewhere.< /review>< GmapID>

There's only 1 poor lady actually working and maybe the manager, besides them it seems the other guy is just simply standing at the encounter and saying "What can I help you?"and pass down everything to the lady next to him. Poor people are waiting in line to pick up their stuffs and mails so it seems like mailmen don't really work either.</Review>< user_id>

I called and was kept on hold over 30 minutes, so I decided to go down there. when I got there, I was helped right away by a gentleman by the name of David. I left my house very upset, but after David helped me with patience and superior customer service I left at ease. Keep up the great work David!!!!!<//text>

<text>I'm so frustrated with this location. Time and time again the P.O. box lobby which is supposed to be open at 6am, does not open on time.  When I go to the back of the building where trucks deliver mail, they say I'm not supposed to be there, but I tell them I'm waiting for the front to open on time.  Even when I've emailed usps online with complaints, I have never once got a reply saying the issue has been resolved.  I wish this location would provide some basic level of support and service.</text>< pictures>

Worst service ever! Shipping a book in a thin envelope that w/ bubble. Instead of telling me that there's another way to ship books they insist on trying to get me to pay the higher price when I've already shipped this same exact item at the cheaper rate. When I asked to speak to the Supervisor and then asked for an outside contact she cave me the consumer affairs number and the spun my envelope back around in the little turn style and her and the cashier left me standing there at an empty window. I called consumers affairs & the guy explained to me the different shipping options. Which either of them could have done. I should have known when I saw the rating to stay away from this place. Jeez! And they wonder why USPS is losing business.< /Text>

<Text>Amazing customer service from 2,300 miles away! I wish I remembered the name of the woman who helped me today. I sent an Ebay package to CA all the way from MI. There was an issue & the given address was undeliverable. Tracking status said it was being sent back to me. I found the post office location of the package & called them. The woman found it in the system & put me on hold. When she returned to the phone call she was out of breath from running to retrieve the package for me because it was on the truck & almost departed. She secured the package AND had it sent to the nearest post office to the buyer. WOW! She saved myself and my buyer time & money. Thank You!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bad experience with them lying about a delivery.  Waited for them to show up at 10. They never did so I called and I went to the post office and it was never taken out for delivery. It was live birds. Take I've been waiting all day and calling. Of course  they said I wasn't home.ask me to sign for the package and I did but  the backside I didn't see indicated they attempted the delivery which screwed me of the guaranteed shipment I paid for refund.</review><name>dimaggio Bell</name><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< time>

Lazy delivery person had a parcel too big for my mailbox but didn't even knock on my door, although I was home all day.  Scheduled a redelivery online for the next day and it didn't show up after two days.  Called to talk to someone and they never answered the phone.<//review>

This post office is the worst I've ever been to in my life. I have lived in the Bay Area for 40 years and have never experienced such poor customer service. They're  closed when they say they're open. The staff act like they're doing you a favor by serving you. Don't try picking up packages on a Saturday. They say they're open but they're not.< /text>

<text>Ok were do I begin...the customer service is not so great but the manager will help you! He helped me find my package that I was waiting for a week now, I was getting the run around becuase they couldnt find it and I have the notification on my phone that it has departed from one facility to another and no one seem to know were it was at! If there were more people like the manager there I would gave it a 10 star but unfortunately they dont.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is the worst Post office that anyone could ever come across. They never answer the phones, their customer service is outrageously horrible, and all you get is a run around when dealing with package issues. Had a package that was mysteriously labeled undeliverable as addressed. Was told it was sent back to the shipper. A week later, checked the tracking label and found out that my package has gone to 3 different post offices in here in Oakland, before being sent to Los Angeles, then back to 2 different post offices back in Oakland, the last being 94621 post office. It's marked on the tracking web site as out for delivery. Three days later, I still haven't received the package.</review></record>

<name>Angela Borja< /name><Review>Needed a passport in 6 week  All local places did not have available appointments in time...Passing on good advice this office does not make appts for passport... get there when it opens at 8:30am go in main area and let lady behind the glass know you are there for a passport. She will give you a number. We got there at 9:30 ish so not first, we received #4. They instructed me to return at 10:40 for my turn. So we went to la piñata. Had breakfast got back at 10:30am. They were still on #1 at that time. So their estimate was super wrong. No matter I had to make sure I didn't miss my opportunity. Finally was seen sometime around 12:30pm. But got it done.  That's the process if u need to know.  Good luck!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

As everyone below has said, customer service is the absolute worst. The supervisor here ( who was supposed to assist with a missing package) did nothing. I've had to call him numerous time to follow up on a task that is his job and he continues to tell me to wait another week or so. Really?  Then the guy asks if I have numbers for him to call in order to try to track the package down? I could've done that on my own. Week later I call            (because he hasn't followed up with me still). And he gives me a number in order to try and get a refund). Call that number and the woman is blunt as hell and equally as useless. If you can avoid calling these people ( at least in my area), do it.</Text>

WOW, this is the reason I do not want to even reside in Oakland since my mail and package go through this post office. the post office sucked. the worst ever in service, picking up call, and even attending to customers. I hate this post office. they all should get fired and close the office. they are wasting tax payers money< /review>

<Time>1492529845471< /Time><rating>1</rating><text>Ever since I have changed my address from Berkeley 94702 to 94621, my mail has been getting lost and on occasion returned to sender. They leave delivery notices and then the packages are lost at the Airport Station. Sometimes items are marked as delivered although they are not. Supervisors don't seem to care about resolving issues of mail service. They fail to follow up about lost packages. I just finished writing to the Postmaster General in D.C.  I actually wonder if they are directed to be incompetent or are they just plain stupid? This seems to be part of Trump's scheme to deconstruct America's government agencies for the purpose of privatization.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
2 day express ebay package never made it to me, it's been 5 days now. I called friday and confirmed with an employee that the package was there and for her to hold it because i wouldn't be at my house to sign for it(sign confirmation) mid-day. This transpired around 8:25 am (right when they opened, if not a little before), I get there around 12 pm and they tell me it went out for delivery. I wait at the house from 5 to 8 for a delivery and it never comes so I check my usps tracking updates and it shows that the package was there for a day or 2 before being sorted, and that morning they sorted the package at 8:27am, they updated that a notice was left at my door at 8:30am. I live at least 20 minutes away from the center and to add insult to injury they never left a notice on my door and the place is closed on weekends.<//Review>

I proceed to tell him about a package being delivered without being here, and offer him my tracking number, and he cuts me off and says call at 5. You guys CLOSE at 5 -.- Why are ppl like him employed?!< /review>< username>

THIS IS THE WORST POST OFFICE ON THE PLANET. TOLD THEM TO HOLD MY ORDER FOR ME, CAME ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FACILITY TO PICK UP THE ORDER AND THEY DELIVERED IT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS. CALLED THEM TO FIGURE OUT WHERE MY PACKAGE WAS AND THE LADY TOOK MY TRACKING NUMBER, NAME AND PHONE NUMBER AND TOLD ME SHE WOULD CALL ME THE FOLLOWING DAY BECAUSE HER CARRIER WAS OFF. THE FOLLOWING DAY, I NEVER GOT A CALL. CHECKED MY ORDER, THEY SHIPPED IT BACK TO ME WITHOUT CALLING OR FOLLOWING UP.

VERY UPSET AND MY MOTHER IS A POSTMASTER FOR A POST OFFICE.< /text>

I've order so many packages that were all lost and they never returned info to me nor the seller to confirm if they missing or anything! All my packages were very expensive items and costed expensive to ship through their epress services, and yet come up missing! I'd never receive nor send through USPS services again!</review>

I agree with most of the posts - how can you rate such a great experience. Fantastic time and beautiful channel island coastline. I am not a strong paddler so I was a bit worried. We did the tandem kayak and had NO problem at all. Loved the trip so much that a few years later, we took the in-laws there for their 50th anniversary!<//Review>

Ben was awesome and the kayak tour of Channel Islands was incredible!! You get to kayak through caves and around the island. The guides are very knowledgeable we had a blast. Will highly recommend for the price!<//Text>

Wow... how do you even leave a review for one of the best times of your life?

We had booked this trip many months ago before the second wave of Covid shut everything down. Thankfully they had an amazing Covid procedure in place and I was able to save my credit for when camping opened up again.

When it was time to reschedule I was anxious about calling them... that's what I get from being in a generation who hates talking on the phone! 🤣 but my fears were quickly subsided when a young man answered the phone and helped me reschedule. I believe his name was Dustin (sorry if it wasn't 😅) and he normally didn't work the office but due to bad weather he was stationed there for that day. He quickly scheduled  me another kayak adventure and was ever so pleasant to talk to for a few minutes.

Alright, tour review time! I reiterate the fact that I really dont know how to tell anyone about one of the best times of my life... the views are just so immensely spectacular there are really no words to describe. You really just need to see it for yourselves... so if your reading this looking for a sign to go... THIS IS YOUR SIGN!

What I can tell you about is my tour group, it consisted of a lovely family from New Mexico and a bad ass independent woman who just moved to California and at the head of it all was our tour guide Marc (with a C). My wife an I have been to about 20 National Parks now and done probably a gazillion tours and I have never met someone like Marc (with a C).

You know that cool person you were in school with or worked with or whatever and you just were like "wow I want to be that person's friend"? That is Marc. He just seeps the aura of awesomeness! Not only is he cool and awesome but he's also friendly! Within minutes we were already chatting about our lives and future goals.

As if that wasn't enough... get this! Marc (with a C) is the most intelligent tour guide I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. He and the genius kid from the family from New Mexico had hours of conversation about the flora and fauna specific to Channel Islands. Most of the tours I've been on have been with tour guides who aren't really passionate about what they are doing and seem to be just stating facts from a flash card. Not Marc, he will tell you all the different scientific names of seaweed, birds, barnacles, fish, etc around the island. And then he'll talk about their eating habits and why they might have almost gone extinct. But not like he's reading a note card he has stuffed in his pocket. This dude is passionate!

And to top it all off... this guy makes you feel safe! If you are feeling apprehensive about your well-being I urge you that you shouldn't let that stand in the way of getting the tour.. This was my first time ocean kayaking and my wife's second time kayaking ever! And let me tell you not once in the 3+ hours did I feel in harms way. You will be completely geared up with helmet, wet suit, life jacket and more if you choose. Also, the tour guides are trained to help you get out of any trouble if by some happenstance you get into any... I know for a fact Marc( with a C) would've carried us all on his back and swam 20 miles if something were to happen. So, if you're reading this and my first sign wasn't enough here is your second sign to get a tour right away.

Thank you to Adventure Co. for working around Covid and a big thank you to Marc (With a C) for an absolutely amazing experience!< /text>

<text>Lots of fun on the sunset kayaking tour.  Only complaint was that we weren't on the water during sunset, but nature  is hard to control.  Our guide was great, and the staff was helpful and accommodating during booking.  Maybe we'll do the channel islands next time.< /text>< user_name>

<text>Beautiful tour. Very fun. The lady that hosted the event was a great instructor and knowledgeable about the history of the harbor. I originally booked the tour for my daughter and I but last minute my daughter had a bit of an emergency and wasn’t able to attend. I was able to get a refund back for her not attending which was very satisfying. Definitely would recommend this place.< /text>< Pics>

It was the most peaceful I’ve felt all year, especially with all this covid craziness. The ride was a great price for what you get and Bob who scheduled the ride for me was very helpful in finding me the perfect ride. The sunset 6:15 ride is a must. Paco, who led the small group of us on the trail was extremely experienced. I’ve ridden horses my whole life and usually ride on my own because often times on trails you get treated as a beginner (for safety reasons), but Paco picked the right horse for my experience level and was extremely attentive to every person in the group. He put safety first and it was easy to tell he loves the horses so much.
I’ll definitely be coming back here!< /review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Awesome experience all around kayaking at Santa Cruz Island. Great customer service prior to our adventure. Then the day of the trip, we also had friendly, helpful staff assisting us from check-in to the moment we got off of the return boat. Kayaking was an experience! Happened to go on a windy day, so it was a challenging adventure. But our guide was encouraging, helpful, and knowledgeable. Incredible way to see the island, the sea, and the wildlife!<//Review>

My two grown children (ages 22 and 25) flew out from the Midwest to camp on Santa Cruz Island with us. We were excited to be able to add on a kayaking experience. The ocean was a bit rowdy the day we went out and our guide was a pro at helping us navigate from point to point without any issues. We got to peek inside sea caves and learn about the marine life and history of the area. I'm certified as a Wilderness First Responder, so it was cool to learn that our guide was also certified. Just an extra level of preparedness that gives you confidence in a guide. We were comfortable in our wetsuits and kayaks. Had a great day. I highly recommend it.< /Review>

<Review>My boyfriend, Paul, & I had an AMAZING experience kayaking with Spencer as our tour guide on 09/21/19. We wanted to celebrate Paul's birthday out in the island, and the trip was definitely one for the book! Spencer was adventurous, knowledgeable, and definitively courteous for the safety of his guests. He always went into the deep caves first to check their conditions, then made sure to guide us safely through all of them. We were all in awe of the beauty of Santa Cruz island throughout the entire 3-hour kayaking. Ever since we got back, we kept recommending our friends and families to go visit Channel Islands, and if possible, book this kayak tour!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Amazing experience!! Cannot thank Marc enough for leading us though such a perfect day. He was great for the whole group. Super informative and funny. Kayaked the Channel Islands, in, out and through the many sea caves! Exciting, challenging and so much fun! We we're lucky enough to have low tide giving us opportunities for most of the caves. Kayaked with seals, swam at the beach and saw 6 large pods of dolphins!! Just awesome!< /review>< Pics>

<text>We went on the adventure sea cave kayaking tour, which was amazing! I am a local (but have never visited the islands) and my friends are from Colorado. It was an amazing experience for all of us.

Our guide, Nikki, was kind, fun, patient, and knowledgeable. She kept us all safe, while ensuring we were able to explore and experience the beautiful caves.  Everyone in the company (from booking to checking in to outfitting us for the tour to guiding us through the caves) was extremely helpful and an absolute joy.  My friends were able to purchase a reasonably priced waterproof phone case on the island so they could capture some photos of our adventure on the water.

We saw hundreds of dolphins and a humpback whale on the ferry, and were able to see foxes, birds, and sea life on the island.

It was an unforgettable experience and I highly recommend it to everyone. It is an amazing way to experience the beautiful channel islands!!<//text><username>Sarah Shriver</username>< date>

First time Ocean kayakers (fresh water kayakers and rowers) on a tour.  Wonderful experience!  Tour guides (Ryan and Nick) were very knowledgeable with adventure experience! We felt very safe and learned about Island's history and environmental issues and wildlife.  Degree of difficulty is your choice.  Highly recommend experience with Santa Barbara Adventure Company! Also, we camped at Scorpion campground and it was very easy accessing the meeting area for the tour!< /text>

Me and my friends went kayaking with Sarah. It was the first time for 2 of us but our guide made sure we kept up with the group. All in all a great experience and I am hooked to kayaking now!<//Review>

I just wanted to tell you what a first-rate organization you have (though I suspect you already know this). I was just out on Santa Cruz with some of the top travel agents from Germany and France, and Scott and Chuck took them on an unforgettable kayak tour. A lot of the crew were novice kayakers, and Scott and Chuck handled everything with professionalism and fun. Not necessarily in order of importance:)< /text>

We left from Ventura Harbor on Island Packers Ferry to cross the channel.  The Channel Island Adventure Company is a well run division of the Santa Barbara Adventure Company that leads all the guided kayak tours on the islands.  Our guide Kyle was great.  He made the adventure safe and efficient while making it fun challenge.  The kelp forests are amazing and teaming with life.  We learned and saw so much about the galapagos of Cali.  The whole process from booking to return was well executed and smoothly guided.  These guys have all the knowledge, certifications, experience and great gear to successfully lead you and your entire large group to a great day on the water.</Text>< resp>

<Review>My wife and I did both the kayak tour of the sea caves at the Channel Islands National Park and the bicycle tour of the wineries.  Both were fantastic!  We took the three-hour sea kayak tour of the sea caves and still had time to take a short hike to enjoy the view of the island and coast.  Our guide, John, did a wonderful job explaining about the caves and the wildlife.   One additional note, we ordered lunch through the Channel Island Provisioning company suggested by the Santa Barbara Adventure Company and I highly recommend it.  The food was great, packaged conveniently for kayaking and was conveniently delivered.

The bike tour of the wineries was hosted by our guide Catherine, who also did a wonderful job.  The wineries had great wines to try.  Although the ride was not strenuous it went through some beautiful countryside with expansive views of the area.  It made for a thoroughly enjoyable day.< /Review>< Pictures>

Not great management of our time - left us with little time to explore the island.  Disappointed in the dangerous conditions we faces on the kayak tour.  Definitely not appropriate for beginners as advertised.  Too windy to take the course we did. A pleasant ferry ride - but I'd skip the rest next time.</Review>

Excellent tour of the Channel Islands Sea Caves! We saw so much wildlife including sea lions, seals and sea birds and explored some incredible caves! The tour guide, Elise, was awesome! She had so much knowledge on the islands and was great at breaking down how each cave would be and gearing us up for the paddle in. We can't wait to go back!< /Text>

We had the best time! Adventure company was really well organized, from start to finish and didn't rush us through any phase of the trip especially the ocean kayaking instructions and change of clothes before that. We had bought the snorkel package as well, but they let us know well in advance that we may not have time to do it given it was a day trip for us & the ferry leaves at 3. They let us decide till the last minute on whether we wanted to still do snorkelling and refunded our money without us having to tell them a second time. Our guide Chuck was extremely patient, well-versed with the history of the islands and cautious about safety.

Highly recommend!</Text>

Our guide, Marina, was amazing! She took two families out (with four kids) and told us all about the ecosystem for the island, the history of the Native Americans who lived here, and the Park Service’s conservation efforts. We went through caves, and saw a sea lion. What an incredible experience!</review>

<date>1552415360836<//date><Text>Hector and Jerry were fantastic guides on our half day kayak tour from Santa Cruz. The boat ride to the island was extremely rough due to high winds. Hector made sure to check on us and even provided ginger candy to help ease our stomachs. Despite rough waters on the trip to the island, we were able to navigate to three caves. Hector and Jerry gave great instruction on kayaking tips that helped my girlfriend (who has never kayaked) and I navigate the waters easily. They were always aware of surroundings and there to assist when needed. After kayaking was over, they provided trail maps and suggested their favorite hike. Awesome experience, highly recommend it.< /Text><user_name>Jon Grush<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Awesome experience kayaking. Excellent guides, great food on the boat, and the opportunity to take a nap in the bunk beds underneath was a great treat since we were driving all night to get to Santa Barbara. They had an great packing list of things to take that I felt very prepared for the trip. I loved it so much that I will definitely go back next year to do this again and explore one of their many kayaking tours.< /Review>

Not only was the tour amazing but the employees at Island Packers were so friendly and informative they made a solo traveler like myself feel at ease throughout the entire thing.

<text>My wife and I did the two-day kayak and camp trip at Channel Islands National Park with Santa Barbara Adventure Company, and it was absolutely fantastic! They made it so easy and fun from start to finish. I feel like we really got our money's worth out of it! Our guide, Kyle, was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, and we got to do all of the kayaking and exploring and snorkeling at our own pace. The caves and wildlife were absolutely breathtaking. It was a wonderful experience, and I would highly recommend it! The next time we're in the area, we'll very likely do another trip with Santa Barbara Adventure Company.<//text>< pictures>

Virtual communication with the people at Santa Barbara Adventure Company was a pleasure, we switched to a different adventure after booking and someone got back to me right away and was super polite & helpful. We did the ultimate kayaking experience and visited a number of caves, I was amazed how close we were able to get to everything! I never thought I'd actually be able to paddle into a sea cave! Our guide was very knowledgeable and friendly and set a good pace for paddling. Every staff member we came into contact with was a pleasure to interact with, so much that our group commented how nice & helpful everyone was!! I would really recommend this to anyone traveling to the channel islands- if you are thinking about it just do it!! Thank you to everyone at Santa Barbara Adventure Company!<//Text>

<Review>Marina was our guide for the full day Ultimate Kayak Adventure and not only was she incredible and fun and adventurous but she kept us safe going in and out of sea caves that I never would have entered on my own.  We snorkeled, we explored, we had a great time and all thanks to SBAC and Marina specifically! Highly recommend.</Review></record>

<Review>Scheduling this trip was simple and the customer service was very professional. The trip itself was a fantastic experience. When we arrived, the two tour guides were ready and waiting for us, with all the necessary equipment. They were both very knowledgeable, provided a lot of interesting information about the area we toured and they were very careful about keeping us all safe. They were friendly and very personable. They made sure to explain everything that would happen on the trip before we began, as well as during the tour. We saw sea lions and pelicans, beautiful scenery and stopped for a nicely set up lunch on a lovely beach. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting a bit of an adventure!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Our group did the sunset kayak tour and had a blast! The company was courteous by calling the day before to double check our time, then the tour guide called to let us know there was construction and to park in another area rather than battle it. I recommend using them for their services based completely off the great customer service!<//Text><Rating>5</Rating>< gmapID>

Pat, Laird and the whole Santa Barbara Adventure Company were awesome!!! Super fun, safety conscious and helpful.  We did the 1.5 hour tour and it was super fun! Not crazy technical from a kayak standpoint, but the scenery, caves, and wildlife were on point! It was a group tour so the skill set ranged from never in a kayak to white water experience. Pat and Laird kept it fun for everyone with cave explorations and informational talks about the local geology, plants and animals. Definitely going again!</Review>

<Text>What a wonderful place to be! I went to Santa Cruz Island and i had an amazing day with the contribution of the guys from Santa Barbara Adventure Company.
The Island is beautiful but be aware that you need to bring food and book your adventure in advance in case you want to do something more than just hiking. My guide was Adam and he is very knowledgeable about the island and its wildlife. First things first. The boat ride to the island is amazing, we saw a group of dolphins, sea lions and WHALES!!!!Once we arrived at the island we went kayaking for 3hours ( the best part!) the caves are amazing and its so much fun to see the island from the ocean!!! After that you are free to go snorkeling and/or hiking.
The guides made everything very easy and relaxed. They do not rush you to get ready and to move to the next part. Everyone goes on its own pace so you can enjoy your day.
Very nice group of people. Cant wait to go back!!! Thank you so much for all the attention!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

My best friend and I did the biking wine tour and the kayaking tour around Santa Barbara's Harbor and they were both fabulous! They send you a great detailed email before your trip so you know what to expect and what to bring. Their gear was top notch and the details they provide on the routes is outstanding. All the employees had a lot of knowledge on the history of Santa Barbara too, bonus! I was thoroughly impressed!  Oh also, they stand apart from the other companies because we were their during the week and we called several places for wine tours...most companies would only run them if they had more than two people go...and the Santa Barbara Adventure Company didn't bat an eye and ran the trips no matter how many people they had!<//review>

A fabulous, one-of-a-kind adventure kayaking the sea caves on Santa Cruz Island.  Everything was done exceedingly well - logistics, equipment, instruction, guiding, safety.  And the caves and the surrounding rugged shores - off the charts.< /Review>

we did the cupcakes and wine tour.  they brought us to three wineries that were very different from each other, yet enjoyable in their own way. the drives were very scenic. our host Halli was very friendly and casual, and easygoing. the program delivered on everything we were expecting. my friends and I (there were 5 of us) had a great time wine tasting thanks to the SB Adventure Company. I would definitely recommend it to other girl friends.<//Review>

<text>My best friend and I just spent 2 nights on Santa Cruz Island.  We booked a  Kayak tour on line and it was smooth sailing all the way.  Our Kayak guide - Chuck - was just fantastic!  He walked to our campsite to give us a reminder.  We were fitted with our safety gear which was all in excellent condition and clean.  After our preliminary instructions, off we went on our Sea Cave Adventure.  It was AWESOME!  Not only did we go in and through multiple caves, we also learned quite a bit about marine life, animal life, and geological history of the island.  All in all a wonderful experience.  Cannot wait to return.< /text>< pics>

Liard and Hector were awesome guides!   They were very patient as instructors and were very knowledgeable as guides!  They were very upbeat and had great senses of humor.  We could tell that they loved what they do!  We had a blast kayaking along the coastline.  We were also very impressed with their attention to detail with lunch - very freshly prepped ingredients for sandwiches. (Literally prepped right on the gorgeous shore!)  We highly recommend these guys!< /Review>

<review>My friends and I were in Santa Barbara for the weekend at the end of July. We thought kayaking would be fun so we decided to book individual kayaks for each person. We picked the Coastal Kayaking activity at Santa Barbara Adventure Company. We arrived and was promptly checked in. We signed waivers and received safety instructions. There were two instructors and quite a big group of people so we split into two groups. Laird was our group leader and Hector lead the other group. Both groups went around the harbor, out into the ocean to see sea lions (unfortunately we didn't see any due to a large amount of boats in the area),  stopped at the other side of the coast to have lunch, and went back to the original stop that we headed out from. Laird and Hector prepared lunch for us and it was very good. They had a neat set-up with tables and different types of meats and cheese for sandwiches. The carrots and hummus was very good after kayaking. There was chips and drinks for everyone as well. We were all impressed. Laird and Hector was very  knowledgeable about the area, kind, patient, and cool. They accommodated everyone and were very cool about waiting for people to catch up with the rest of the group during multiple stops we made. Laird and Hector were great guides and we were very fortunate to have them as guides. We had a great time! We would recommend this to our friends and family.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e9138374e30929:0xe63ac065921c6d6<//Gmap_id></record>

Pat was amazing! This was my 1st time surfing, I felt safe and relaxed in the water. It was so much fun. I highly recommend Santa Barbara Adventure, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, the equipment provided is very well kept and they make the experience fun for everyone. Totally turned this MN girl into a Surfer girl. 😁</Text>

<Review>Our kayak tour of Santa Cruz Island included viewing wildlife, floating through sea caves, and relaxing in our kayaks while learning the history of the island.  I felt completely comfortable and safe during our tour.  I had an amazing visit, and would call this a "must do" on any trip to Southern California.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I booked my tours over the phone. The process was very easy, and the lady was very accommodating for my trip - I opted to do a tour on my first and third days on Santa Cruz island. The first day I was in a small group led by Dan. He took us on an amazing tour of Scorpion Island and showed us many sea caves. We even got to go through some of them. On the third day, I went with Hector. Since I was the only person on his tour, we were able to go out further to Potato Harbor. Hector was very knowledgeable about the wildlife and the history of the islands. I would definitely book kayak tours with this company again and highly recommend Dan and Hector as guides. Thanks for making my trip magical!<//Text>

We did the painted cave tour. Saw so many seals in and around the caves. They even swam around us while we kayaked from one cave to another. What a Great adventure. Super nice guides. The food on the ride back was delicious. Loved Ben and Aaron. Would recommend SBAC to everyone.< /text>

Kayaking the caves off the coast of the Santa Cruz island will remain one of the highlights of our entire four week trip to the United States. Not only was the natural surrounding pristine and we got to see sea plants and creatures that we partly didn't even know about - our two very likeable guides also were true encyclopedias to tell us everything about this environment there was to know. Since we were lucky with the weather and didn't encounter any high waves, the challenge of taking the kayaks through the tight spots of the caves was really fun. We even were so lucky to be able to go all the way back into one of the long caves where it was all dark and quiet. The snorkeling after the kayaking rounded of the amazing experience of nature. I would recommend this trip to anyone who is looking for a small adventure!<//text>

Shout out to the best guides ever - Hector and Billy on the Sea Cave Kayaking Tour!  Kudos to SBAC for hiring passionate young people who are knowledgeable in their field of study and generous of spirit.  Hector and Billy were patient, encouraging and excellent communicators who connected easily with others.  The set-up for equipment was well-organized and ran smoothly.  The rental gear was in good shape and everyone was fitted properly.  Extra water bottle refills were complimentary and sunscreen reapplication was offered.  Great day!  Great experience!  Will be returning with more friends!< /Review>

Our group went on the Refugio kayak trip. It was AMAZING! Our guides, Aaron and Janae did a great job teaching us how to kayak and letting us know what it was we were seeing. We ended up in the middle of a huge dolphin pod. This was atypical, but extremely awesome. I would definitely go through Santa Barbara Adventure Co. again.<//review>

Kayaking along the shore and through sea caves at Santa Cruz Island. What a treat! Our expectations were high for this trip and they were exceeded.

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We booked the 2.5 - 3 hour sea cave kayak tour to Scorpion Anchorage, Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park.  Check in was easy and procedures for the day were well explained.  Once we got to the island we were grouped up with a great guide.  He was knowledgable and made the tour what we wanted it to be.  We got to experience many different types of caves along the island.  His knowledge and excitement of the area made the trip fun and informative.
You are on the water for a good amount of time but have the option of going in earlier if you have had enough.  I felt the length of the tour was great.
After the tour we had plenty of time to swim and or snorkel or hike.  We choose to do a very nice small hike and really enjoyed it.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80e9138374e30929:0xe63ac065921c6d6< /GmapID></record>

<text>First things first--if you're looking for an unforgettable sea adventure than look no further!!!

I took a group of friends on the painted cave sea kayak tour to celebrate my bachelor party in July. I can honestly say that this was one of the most unique and incredible experiences I've had (and I've done a lot of outdoor activities) and I highly recommend this tour to anyone looking to explore one of the least visited public parks in the country--the Channel Islands.

The day started at 7:30am with a check-in where we were greeted by one of the amazing tour guides Laird who gave us the run down of the day and had us fill out some basic paperwork. We boarded the boat at 8am where we were treated to a full-spread continental breakfast. The boat is super clean and spacious, with two bathrooms, 3 hot showers and a number of sleeping bunks below deck. It takes about 2 hours to reach the islands but the time flies--you can nap in one of the many bunks available below deck, hang out in the upstairs cabin to keep warm, or as I did hang out on deck and catch the amazing views. We came across multiple pods of dolphins on the way out who really but on a show! It does get chilly if you're standing on the deck so be sure to wear warm clothes and have an extra pair of dry warm clothes for the ride back. On the kayak tour a bathing suite will do (they'll provide wetsuit, helmet, jacket, life preserver, etc).

Upon arrival at the islands we sat through a 15 minute prep session where the guides went over all the safety information and gave us a run down of the equipment as well as what to do out on the water (such as how to get back in if you fall out of your kayak). We put on our equipment and launched our kayaks straight from the boat.

From there, what happens next can only be described as indescribable. Our guide Spencer took us on a 2.5hr adventure where we kayaked into various sea caves and got face-to-face with multiple species of birds, sea lions, seals, etc. I hesitate to provide much more detail because it's one of those things you really need to experience, but trust me when I tell you it's a "must do!"

Back on the boat, we had a 30 minute opportunity to do some optional snorkeling while a hot lunch was being prepared. I took a hot shower, changed into my warm clothes and then went below deck for a nap in the bunk which lasted the duration of the return trip. Woke up back at harbor fully rested and still beaming from the awesome experience of the day.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Pierce (aka Pierre as I liked to call him) was THE MAN!  One of my best experiences with a tour guide as he was very insightful with not just the marine life, but the surrounding area as well.  He was very flexible and accommodating with our adventure around the Santa Barbara harbor and in the ocean.  I was impressed with the provided lunch as he put together quite the spread, earning him master chef status.  Before the day started, my wife and I were disappointed since we cancelled our Channel Islands kayaking trip due to the expected rough waters, but this harbor excursion made us not regret a thing, and Pierce was a blast to hang out with the entire time. I would wholeheartedly recommend SB Adventure Co, and Pierce for that matter, for any guided tour in the area. Well done!< /review>

<review>We did the Sea Cave Kayak tour and it was absolutely amazing! Our tour guide was very informative and friendly. There were only a total of 6 people in our group which made the tour very personable. Our guide was nice enough to use our GoPro to video tape us at a few points throughout the tour. We saw Peregrine Falcons, Harbor Seals, dolphins, fish, and many caves. The water was VERY clear when we were there and the weather was gorgeous. They also allow you to use their snorkeling gear absolutely free and I highly recommend it! On our way back, our ferry went out of its way to take us by a 100+ pod of dolphins which was also an amazing sight. It was our favorite part of our 9 day trip in California. HIGHLY recommended.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1444669052178<//Time><rate>5<//rate>< Resp>

We did the 2 day kayak trip.  It was organized well, guides were fun and knowledgeable.   We really enjoyed exploring the islands and hanging out with the guides.  Guides had lots of great suggestions for hiking, snorkeling and relaxing as well.      Wonderful experience.</Text>

< review>
Our private kayak tour on Santa Cruz island (Prisoners harbor) was FANTASTIC! We really appreciated how chill, sweet yet knowledgeable our guide Ryan was. My husband and I don't generally like tours and feared we might be spending a day with an over-the-top cheerly guide despite of our plan to escape to a remote island, but it was like having an experienced, nature-loving friend with us on the adventure instead. Thanks for the lovely weekend!

The company was wonderful at the time of booking; they were very flexible and accommodating. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

Adam and Hector KILLED IT! Best day ever, very knowledgeable, interacted with all of us, I mean he knew our entire party's names in the first few minutes. Had the option to not participate in anything you felt was beyond your comfort level. I mean just an awesome experience. Book these guys now!< /Review>

We had a great Kayak tour of Santa Barbara Harbor and nearby beaches last week.  Excellent instruction for beginners (kids 10 and 13), nice pace throughout, lots of wildlife and nature info, delicious (filling) lunch, and fun kayak wave surfing at the end!  Would highly recommend for any age group.< /review>

We recently spent our honeymoon in Santa Barbara and used SB Adventure to take their sea cave kayaking trip to the Santa Cruz island. It's was an awesome experience and we both would recommend it to anyone. Our guides were friendly, knowledgable and very experienced. Definitely a fun trip for any age group. You'll be amazed at the beautiful scenery and the large amount of wildlife.</text>

We took a day trip out to Santa Cruz, kayaked to the sea caves & snorkeled.  The Guides where friendly and helpful; they made sure we were safe, had fun and answered all our questions. We got to see whales, dolphins, sea lions (some swimming on either side of our kayak!) Kelp, garibaldi and blacksmith fish, and other beautiful, coastal wildlife.  The boat ride was comfortable and they served good food for breakfast & lunch. I highly recommend Santa Barbara Adventures for great memories!</review>

We saw lots of dolphins and 2 whales while crossing to the Channel Islands.  We then made the kayak tour: well organized, safe, small group.  Really enjoyable.  Only black spot: the pricing is pretty high.< /Text>

The Sea Kayak tour was outstanding. With no kayak experience we were comfortable and as challenged as we chose to be. We had a great time in the sea caves. Our guide Aaron was not only a great kayak guide, he is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable naturalist which added to the experience. Had a great time on the island and saw all manner of wildlife from the island fox to seals and sea lions within a few feet. Everything was well planned and professional. We look forward to our next adventure.</Review>

I was worried that I would get too cold, but they provided all the necessary equipment to keep me warm - wetsuit, jacket, shoes.

We had an awesome and very memorable adventure. Our guide (Adam) was fantastic--very knowledgable and attentive, taking care to be sure that everyone was comfortable and having a great time.The experience itself was exhilarating and quite enjoyable, including the fun of going into the sea caves, bird-watching and learning more about the history and geology of the Islands. Highly recommended!< /Review>

Went on a lovely 1.5 hour kayak tour of Santa Cruz island with Will. We wanted the three hour but it was booked, they were kind enough to fit us on the shorter tour. The group sizes are small and the guides are very attentive. We learned a lot, had a blast, and really appreciated every single staff member's friendly and helpful attitude. Would go back in a heartbeat.</text>

My husband and I just went on the Painted Cave Sea Kayaking tour.  I wanted to do something really cool for my 30th birthday and this was totally it!  All the staff were super friendly and helpful.  There was a ton of food and drink on the boat.  The guides gave a really thorough intro and were very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the trip.  We were provided wet suits and after the amazingly fun tour, we were offered snorkeling gear and took advantage of the clear waters to have a snorkeling adventure.  I highly recommend this company and this trip.  Everyone is highly professional, yet laid back and a lot of fun to chat with.  Thank you, Santa Barbara Adventure Company for a wonderful birthday adventure!!!</Review>

<Text>My 11-year old son and I had a fantastic day trip sea kayaking the coast and caves of Santa Cruz island, with tremendous thanks to our guides Laird and Kenchi.  We had the time of our lives! We saw harbor seals, sea lions, an ocean sunfish, nesting sea and shore birds, jelly fish, anemones, star fish and even fish in the kelp forests below our kayaks. Laird was a great naturalist and interpreter, sharing loads of interesting information that appealed to my son and I alike.  I have already recommended this trip to friends, and will continue to do so.< /Text>< GmapID>

A wonderful day on water and land! This was our second visit to Channel Islands National Park and our first to Santa Cruz Island. The day was perfect so our guides, Aaron and Rylan, toured us through sea caves in our kayaks for nearly 3 hours. It was spectacular!

If you go: take advantage of the complimentary wetsuits provided by SB Adventure Co! You will get wet. Take water, take a snack and have fun!

Sea cave kayaking is something most of us won't do on our own -- it's great to go with guides who know each cave, know when it's safe to go in and can instruct on the tricky parts!

Enjoy!</Review>

Fantastic experience! My brother and I went on this trip together and we had an absolute blast. Our guide was funny and super knowledgeable about not only kayaking, but also the channel islands and its wildlife. We learned so much. After a few minutes in the Kayak you really get a feel for it, and I could tell I was getting better and better as the day went on. Something that was super fun was intentionally flipping my kayak to try getting back in (something I wanted to do, not something they ask you to do). Hallie, our guide, had great advice and it was much easier to get back in than expected!

Absolutely something I'd recommend and will probably end up going back to do the other trip myself!< /text>

I never expected to have such a wonderful adventure when I signed up for Santa Barbara Adventures.  We saw all kinds of sea life, close up.  The caves were fascinating and the kayaking experience-- so much fun.  The guides were very experienced and helpful and knowledgeable.  One of the best trips I'd ever taken!   I went with a friend and I want to return again and bring my kids.</Review>

<Review>I booked their Wine and Cupcake pairing tour, and I could not have been happier with it. Our two guides were right on time, picking our group up at the house we were renting. Then we were whisked off on our tour! Our guides were very fun and knowledgeable, and the wineries they brought us to were amazing. The lunch they provided was much better than I expected, and even though it was a long day, it didn't feel like it. I will definitely be booking with them again for my next trip to Santa Barbara.< /Review>< Time>

We recently went on a one day trip to Santa Cruz Island to explore the sea caves with our family. The ocean was beautiful, the caves were amazing & our guide Aaron was terrific. I would recommend Santa Barbara Adventure Company Island tours to anyone who wants a little adventure that is only 40 minutes away from Ventura Harbor!</Review>

day, as did all the girls on our tour. Can't wait to do it again!< /text>

Deciding to book a Channel Island Kayaking Tour with the leading adventure tour operator in Santa Barbara was easy. My wife and I really enjoyed our staycation trip and these guys helped us explore the most unique part of California. The guide was top notch and the overall quality of the experience was well organized and affordable.< /Text>

Being a "newby" to kayaking our experience with Christina and Adam have "hooked" me.  I'm looking into buying my own.  Adam and Christina were EXCELLENT hosts, extremely knowledgeable, and their primary concern was for our safety and comfort.  We never felt rushed or endanger.  We were given a thorough safety  briefing and proper kayaking instructions.  The Refugio coastline tour is exceptional.  We were grateful that the "dolphin" show that Adam had radio ahead for entertained us just as planned.  It was a fabulous first time experience and I'm looking forward to joining Santa Barbara Adventures on a tour of the Channel Island Sea Caves in the future!<//review>

<Review>Would highly recommend these guys if you want to learn to surf on Santa Barbara. Christina was an excellent instructor. Really enjoyed the lesson although 4 hours is quite a long time to surf, particularly for a first time.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>It was an experience of a lifetime! From dolphins swimming along our boat to hiking some of the most beautiful views to kayaking through the the darkest caves, we honestly cannot wait to go back. Our trip seemed like it might be off to a rocky start when we got there and did not have a tent, but not even one minute later we had 3! Everyone was so willing to jump in and help us with our accommodations. The guides are extremely knowledgable and personable. And not to mention how cool it was to watch the fireworks from all the way across the ocean on the mainland! If you are adventurous and want to get away, this trip is the perfect trip for you. Quick note, foxes might be cute in the daylight but at night they can terrorize! The tent was very necessary.< /Review>< Pictures>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>This is my third time kayaking at Santa Cruz island (and second time with Santa Barbara Adventure Company).  The first time that I kayaked around the island, I spent the time to do all of the logistics for our group, which was a lot of effort.  The second time I went with SBAC and it was worth every penny.  Not only is it hassle free in terms of planning, but the guides are excellent and super knowledgeable about both the caves and the ecological history of the area.

This time I did the Ultimate Sea Cave Kayak trip with my girlfriend.  Our tour guide, Marc, was great!  He took our group (7 people) into some of the more advanced caves.  He was just so full of knowledge of the wildlife in and around the water, the history of the rock formations, and how to properly navigate the caves.  We had a really fun time, and will definitely go through SBAC again in the future.  Thanks!!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80e9138374e30929:0xe63ac065921c6d6< /Gmap_id><Name>Tim Hackett< /Name>< user_id>

My 15- and 11-year olds loved it. I did too. Went on the shorter Discovery tour as we aren't experienced kayakers. It was fun and a bit of an adventure when the winds kicked up in the afternoon. Just enough to be exciting, and our guides Chuck and Pierce kept us feeling safe. All in all, highly recommended. I'd go again for a longer trip.<//text>

<review>I recently went on a guided kayak trip of the caves off the coast of Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands National Park. The trip was fantastic! The guides were friendly and professional. They quickly had a group of inexperienced kayakers paddling in and out of amazing cavern formations. They were knowledgeable of the island and its wildlife, quick to share stories and humor, and set us all at ease very quickly.

The highlight of the trip was no doubt the pod of sea lions who herded a bait ball into a cave we had paddled into. As we sat bobbing, the still water grew rough around us as more and more sea lions flooded into the waters of the cavern. We rode out the frenzy with shouts of amazement and joy, faces sore from smiling at the spectacle. An encounter so close with a creature so majestic is a memory that will not soon fade.

The guides at Santa Barbara Adventure Company led a fine adventure. I recommend them wholeheartedly.< /review></record>

<Review>I've only been kayaking a few times, never with a tour. So would it be bias if I say, BEST KAYAKING TOUR EVER?! because it TOTALLY WAS! went 08/13/18 and was told it was the best day this whole season! clear skies, clear calm water, everything was so beautiful!! arrived at the island and hikers and kayakers/snorkelers were split into two groups. we walked to a campsite, took about 10 minutes, where we were to store our backpacks and receive our PFDs and helmet. After we were all set and ready to leave, we had to make the walk back to the shore for kayak instructions and to carry our kayaks to the water. took about an hour from arriving to the island to actually sitting on kayaks in the water. the water was perfect. we went into many caves and our tour guide Chuck shared lots of information about the island and the animals. Chuck taught us how to kayak through the caves safely that even my 9 year old sister didnt have any problems! even though we technically took a long amount of time to get into the water, the tour was still 3 hours long. we got back later than scheduled, they definitely make sure you get your money's worth!

i definitely recommend this tour. without a tour guide you wouldnt know which caves are safe enough to go into or how to even navigate in the caves. the people were wonderful and if you have any questions they answer very quickly! i also suggest applying LOTS of waterproof sunscreen! any inch you miss, you will get burned!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80e9138374e30929:0xe63ac065921c6d6< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

We kayaked from Scorpion Ranch with SBA.  Our guides were pleasant and helpful.  The experience was breathtaking, kayaking into sea caves of a beautiful island.</text>

SBA Co. was wonderful to work with. They were incredibly accommodating and went above and beyond to schedule a special tour time that worked with our group's schedule. The whole experience was delightful and our group raved about our guides, Caco (Ricardo) and Ry. They were so knowledgable and made the trip so memorable. I would highly recommend SBA Co. and will definitely book with them in the future.< /Review>

Thxis was an outstanding trip. There were about 12 people with 2 guides (24 on the boat, which could accommodate more). The guides were very experienced, knowledgeable, and thorough. Equipment was well taken care of, and it was a great experience. The boat captain  was as friendly, made his rounds to make sure everyone had what they needed, and keeps his boat in excellent comdition. Food was unexpectedly good ( light breakfast, strong coffee and fresh chicken enchilladas for lunch). Deck hands were also experienced and professional. Definitely an "A+" trip. The captain sighted two whales on our way back, and took extra time to slow down and view, along with the massive numbers of porpoises.<//Text>

<Review>Having worked in the outdoor recreation industry for over a decade I've seen the good the bad and the ugly when it comes to guides and providers.  SBACO is a class act.  Their gear is in good repair, their staff friendly and professional.  We went on the Santa Cruz Cave Kayak tour.  Our guide Scott completed an in depth orientation on the basics of kayaking.  More importantly he embraced a "safety first" and "challenge by choice" ethic throughout the trip.  Our group included an eight year old and a forty five year old, neither whom had ever been on a kayak before.  We all had a blast and would be happy to hire SBACO again.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

We kayaked the sea caves at Santa Cruz island in Oct 2015. Kyle was our guide from SBAC. He was patient, professional, and gave us a challenge we could handle. Had a great time. Highly recommend SBAC for your next adventure!</Review>

<Text>As part of our 8th grade graduation cruise, I booked our group, of 4 adults and 6 teenage boys, a kayaking adventure with Santa Barbara Adventure Company. We got off the ship and walked over to Sea Landing where Matt and Ryan were waiting for us. It was our first time kayaking and it was perfect. Matt and Ryan were phenominal and gave all of us instruction and local history. We saw plenty of wildlife and they even made us a gourmet lunch. We can't wait to book another kayaking excursion - next time to Santa Cruz island. Thanks, Matt and Ryan for a great time!</Text>< UserId.>

I absolutely loved my day with the Santa Barbara Adventure Company folks! The aquatic wildlife sightings were stupendous ~ mega pods of dolphins, multiple humpback whale pairs, a rare bald eagle sighting, sea lions and sea birds galore and the rough, real beauty of Santa Cruz Island. Just amazing!

The crew and guides were wonderful, with lots of knowledge and support.The food was yummy, and the conversations great! I'm a modestly experienced kayaker and I felt very comfortable in all situations, including when I just didn't feel confident enough to do a particular sea cave. I told friends who live local in Ventura County and they planning a trip now for themselves. The price of the day was more than worth it!< /Review><resp>None< /resp><user>108888061383241608576< /user>< pics>

A friend and I took the Santa Barbara Adventure Co. sunset kayak tour with a group of 6 people and our guide, Janae, on August 12. The team at SBAC made booking simple and were great communicators via phone and email.
The tour was amazing. Sunset over the Pacific coastline from in the ocean is a completely different experience than being on the land. Janae was a phenomenal guide. Her blend of facts and fun and her ability to connect with everyone in the group made a trip of 6 strangers into a shared memory that will last forever. I will certainly recommend this experience to friends, family, co-workers and strangers alike, and plan on doing it again in the near future!<//Text>

<Time>1459178404440</Time><review>Our rental sea kayaks with a different company were cancelled last minute, so we scrambled with trying to get a guided kayak trip scheduled with Santa Barbara instead. They were overly helpful in the complexities of trying to get something scheduled, working with another kayak guide company since they had limited space last minute. We weren't able to get our young kids in kayaks after all, but with the only one remaining space on the kayak trip, our guide let me and my husband split the time. I was so grateful that we could get our full experience when we were in such a crunched position. Our guide, Caco, gave us a perfect balance of safety and adventure. He allowed me to push myself with the potential danger of the big waves in the caves while being clearly precautious with our safety, scoping out all caves alone before allowing us to join with specific instructions.

Concerning customer service:
Overall, I couldn't be more satisfied. I will admit that I was initially worried when I received an email a day or so before saying that we would need to "meet our guide on the island because he was staying on the island over-night"; however, a representative gave me phone call, making sure that I had received the email and easing my anxiety about not being able to find my guide by assuring me "you will see him when you get off the boat.
The day of our trip, road signs clearly indicated how to get to the ferry. Upon arriving at the island, "Ry", our guide for the day, was greeting me before I even had both feet on the dock. Ry was extremely nice and down-to-earth; but best of all, he was extremely knowledgeable in terms of the SB area, kayaking, as well as the wildlife and everything in between - I was unusually impressed with extent of his knowledge. I'd give the guy 6 stars if it were possible.

Concerning the Channel Islands themselves:
Well... the only way that I have managed to explain the beauty to my friends and family is "amazingly awe-inspiring"... The only other way I can think to describe the scenery and the experience is to tell you that I chose that day, after kayaking around Scorpion Beach, to propose to my girlfriend (now fiance).<//Text>

We stayed at the hotel Milo at your suggestion and it was a great cottage type room and everyone was really friendly.  Rode horses through your referell and had a great time. Megan, our wrangler was a sweetheart and great conversationalist.  The channel island kayaking package was as memorable as I could of hoped for, and the guide and transport company where fun, friendly, and really versed in the area.  What was best about all the info you sent me in regards to Santa Barbara, Ventura, & Oxnard was all of the restuarant, winery, coffee shops, and parks that you wrote to me about made the whole trip enjoyable and stress free.  Couldn't have asked for better all around trip help than what you gave me and my trip wouldn't have been as perfect without you and your sage advice.  THANKS!< /Text>

SBA made the trip out to Santa Cruz Island a breeze. Once we got to the island, Cade (our guide) was waiting for us and we began the day. There was a quick (but comprehensive) safety orientation and then we were out to sea. Cado was a patient and confident guide, so we knew we were in good hands. He was conscientious about making sure we were comfortable and safe at all times, while directing us through the unbelievable caves. He was also very knowledgable about the island and eager to share the information. We came back and had lunch and then took off on a hike because the water was too cold to snorkel. Next time, I'd like to do that. All in all a great day and a great company to facilitate it. Two thumbs up.< /Review>

We wanted to book the full day sea cave kayak tour but all the slots were already reserved so we could only find the afternoon to evening tour. We had a wonderful time on the island and on the sea cave kayak tour. We left around 8am from Ventura Harbor and reached Scorpion Bay on Santa Cruz Island around 9:30am. We were on the island for pretty much the whole day. Our return cruise was at 5pm and we reached Ventura Harbor at 6:30pm.

While we were on the island, we hiked the Potato harbor trail and views on the way were amazing. It was an easy hike and it took us around 4 hours to complete it. If you only do the hike then I bet you could finish it in under 3 hours but we made several stops in-between to enjoy the scenic views and also spent time having lunch at potato harbor. On our way we saw, couple of seal's in the ocean, island fox, several birds including island scrub jay. If you decide to go for hike, then I would advice you to pack a lot of liquid's (water, gatorade as such) and quick bites. There is no shade on the way so better to carry a hat as well. This island has a lot of history as well and if anyone is interested in such things then they would enjoy it too.

If you do not want to do hiking then you could as well do snorkeling. The water is clean and good. The snorkeling gear is freely provided.

Our guides for the sea cave kayak tour were Fiona & Rye and they both were really good and very friendly. This tour was the best part and the overall experience of kayaking and exploring sea caves was very good. We wish to do this again but for the full day tour.<//Text>

<Name>Michelle Sayre< /Name><date>1464664180801</date><rating>5< /rating><review>We did a 1-day "short" kayak tour of Santa Cruz Island.  We had plenty of extra time to go snorkeling, and SBAC provided snorkeling gear. The water was cold, but the wetsuits thick. Wear gloves, hoodie and booties if you're the warm-blooded type like us. The kayak tour was led by Hector,  who was an excellent,  knowledgeable guide. He adjusted the pace of the tour to the group, so we got to see a few extra caves sinve we were a fast-moving group.  We had our teenage kids with us and they really, truly enjoyed the day without a single complaint!  Great family memories. This was a great way to spend a day at a unique National Park that is rarely visited. I highly recommend SBAC for a first-rate experience.<//review>< Pictures>

wow, was our trip to the channel islands ever a once-in-a-lifetime experience! from the start a month before our trip, brooke and others in the sb adventure co office were generous with their time and advice, offering flexible options for us to kayak one one or two of the three days we spent on the island. brooke provided maps, first hand advice, and was generally awesome in helping me plan our trip. we arrived to find high winds and few others on the islands, and the day of our scheduled trip dawned choppy and freezing. our guide, aaron, was super nice and flexible with his timing, allowing us to wait out the rough morning and instead head out for a trip in the afternoon. the choppy seas had prevented the other kayakers from even making it to the island so we basically had a private tour of the caves and coast with aaron! we saw harbor seals, amazing birds and he told us tons of facts about the coast. he was careful to monitor the wave activity before urging us to check out caves and pass-throughs and we had an unbelievable day on the water. although we only got 2 hours on the water when we had thought we might get 3 because of the weather, it was a really nice trip and the adventure of our year for sure. big thanks to santa barbara adventure for planning and execution - they also followed up to make sure we knew what to do before getting there, and loaned us wetsuits and gear! highly recommended!!!<//Text>

Took my son in for the study and Andrew, the tech, was awesome.  He walked my son through everything and explained what each of the wire was for.  He talked to him as a person, not a child and just had a conversation with him.  Made the experience that much easier and helped to ease my son’s nerves.<//Review>

<Text>Very comfortable facility, great sleep specialist technician handled my sleep study. The administration is a little disorganized regarding paperwork, did not have me on the facility schedule, but the sleep specialist did some research and found my appointment on the computer. Not his fault at all! I had asked them to send me registration paperwork ahead of time, twice, and never received it so I had to fill it our when I arrived.</Text><userid>101041066966476260009<//userid>< gmap_id>

Supposed to get results and recommendations to primary care physician in 2 weeks, which is very slow.

Called it 10 days ago, said they will do it ASAP.
Has been 4 weeks and nothing. Worst ever experience, fail.

Do NOT recommend, will NOT visit again by choice.</text>

Staff was friendly and very nice.  But my room door was opened by some unknown person while I was trying to fall asleep.  It was startling and disruptive.  I think that if they put a number or some sign/decal on the door to indicate it's a patient room (and not a potential restroom/ or another communal room) then the mistake will less likely happen.  Other than this instance, it was a pleasant stay.< /review>

The experience was made comfortable with the support and caring Noel. She calmed me down after I was so upset when I couldn’t find the location. The directions should have explained where the Lab was located. It was so dark I couldn’t see the signs. If it wasn’t for a guards help I would have never found the location.
The study was better then I experienced before. The stuff that was put on my face was very difficult to remove and left my face very red and itchy. You should have provided something to clean it off with. The stuff in my hair was equally terrible would be better to get something else to use. Room was nice. Bed would have been nicer with a mattress pad Under the sheet covering the plastic water proof mattress cover. Would have liked some low meditation type music to go to sleep with but that’s not expected. I liked the mask that was used.Looking forward to getting the results.</review>

<Review>Wasn’t sure what to expect as I had never had a sleep study done. This place was very nice, comfy, cozy, accommodating and clean. Staff (Noel) was very pleasant, easy and helpful. The gentlemen at the desk was also very pleasant, helpful and extremely nice. Would definitely recommend this place if you’re going for a sleep study.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The young man Andrew, was one of the most kind, helpful, and respectful  to me.. He explained everything to me and I understood,
I must say, it was so fresh and comfortable place, I would love to be there every night, best rest I've had in years.

Noel and Andrew provided me with high quality of care while I was there. They are both very knowledgeable and have excellent customer service skills. Both are a valuable asset to the company. I don't know how this location doesn't have 5 stars if the two are working here.</review>

I probably should give more stars because it’s probably not the place but the experience itself.  I felt like I got no sleep because of all the wires and being in a new environment.  Then they wake you up to put on the CPAP @ about 2:30AM if you need it.  Then they wake you again at 5:15AM to conclude it.  There’s goo stuck I  your hair from the electrodes so you have to go home and shower.  I could barely drive because I was so tired.  Thankfully I had the day after the test off of work, so I just showered and sat on the couch all day.  Anyway, the tech was great, the place is clean & as comfy as possible, but the experience was awful.< /review>

<review>I read all the website info and filled out the form to have someone contact me for services.  No one contacted me after a week.  So I called and was told they do not provide pap machines for Medicare patients.  NO WHERE ON THEIR WEBSITE DO THEY SAY THAT SO I WASTED MY TIME WAITING FOR THEM TO RESPOND FOR NO REASON.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I am taking care of my son's family dog while he is recovering from surgery as he needs a calm quite environment. The vet in So. Cal. sent a list of 3 Marin vets to contact to have his staples removed. I called all and none could do it within the necessary time. I remembered that I had been to the Novato Chamber of Commerce ribbon cutting for So. Novato Animal Hospital many years ago and was impressed with their facilities. So I called and they were very happy to schedule an appointment on the day the staples needed to come out. The day of the appointment they were great, very quick and the price was much lower than the other vets who could not accommodate us. I will definitely recommend them and use them again.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I agreed with the one-star reviewers that this place cares mostly about money and not about being compassionate.  I do understand that we all have bills to pay but remember being kind, especially during this COVID time when people are struggling to make ends meet and you want to charge unnecessary fee is so greedy.  I just feel that you are not very smart as getting potential customer.  This is a really bad business model especially in a supposed caring and compassionate realm.  I am just glad there are many other options available around Novato for me to go to.</Review>

We went in for a limp and came out a full day later with a 1200 dollar bill and a lackluster diagnosis. Went to a different vet in Novato and for $100 got a real diagnosis and a proper treatment plan that seemed significantly more accurate to our dogs problem. Felt ignored, never got to speak to the actual veterinarian, and always went through the front desk person (whose people skills where rather lacking and rude). Part of the cost was for x rays, for which I had to call 5 times and leave an email to simply have forwarded to me in a zip file, and it’s pretty clear they’re after the money and not your pets best interest. We wanted to give them a chance but we were clearly completely ripped off and exploited because we were concerned for our pet. Spoke to a friend who also had an extremely negative experience here and decided to never come back.  Would not recommended.< /review>

<text>I was looking for a flea treatment for my dog and I realized that South Novato Animal Hospital was less than 2 blocks from were we lived. We went in and requested a single dose of the treatment because I could not afford a 6 month supply at the time. They helped us out and sold us a dose and said we could come back anytime. I will be going to them for now on for my dogs health and beauty needs.<//text>< Pics>

<text>My husband and I have a rescued feral kitty. She's very fearful and extremely difficult to catch and to treat. Her days in the wild contributed to very severe dental disease. Dr. Dahlman was just terrific, noting his own feral cases. He handled her beautifully. I also adore the admin and tech team. Ana, in particular, was so patient and gracious. Excellent follow up. But the admin team also was terrific explaining the care plan. I admire a practice willing to have such an excellent support team in place. And our feral, post-op, is doing just beautifully. She's a different cat.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I love this place. Part of it is that it's very close to my home, and there was absolutely zero wait on a Saturday at 11. But outside of that, we found the staff to be friendly (and funny), and Dr. Dahlman was pleasant and very quick. Some people may not like the idea of the vet taking your animal from the room for treatment (and I imagine it was optional), but I appreciated that he took her away for treatment and returned very quickly. He and the staff were all informative without being condescending. In and out in 20 minutes. I'll add that we've paid $40 more for the same treatment at other vets, so that's also a plus.<//text>< Response>

From the staff at the front desk to the nurses and Dr's, my little guy, Mr. Truffles has been treated with respect, compassion. When I bring Mr Truffles in for his appointment, it feels that he is able to relax because I can relax knowing he is well cared for when he's in their hands. C. Bennett< /review>

I am feeling so lucky and so grateful to the Marin County Humame Society!  In late February I adopted my perfect companion, a seven pound canine marvel who has transformed my life for the better.  I now get the walking exercise I was procrastinating about; have company -- someone to talk to, pet, and watch TV with; someone who loves and needs me; and an eager learner who will soon doing an obedience class with me at the Humane Society.  The folks there are so supportive!  Kudos to The Marin County Humane Society!<//Review>

I have always experienced a level of care beyond excellent and Dr. Ortiz especially has been so in tune with the needs and health status of my kitty and has also been very supportive to me, thorough with exams and testing, and follows up, more than once always, to ensure he is getting better or answers any and all of my questions in a timely manner. I do not know how it could be better, I will continue to bring my kitty to SNAH. Thank you!</text>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Let's face it...my dogs are like my kids. I'm not a crazy dog owner - but I do hold my vet to the same standards I hold my doctors and South Novato Animal Hospital exceeds my expectations. I came to them several years ago when I moved from the East Coast with two dogs - one quite elderly. They lovingly saw me through my beloved, Jack's final year with dignity and love for BOTH my dog and me. My second dog has had several challenging issues - and they have carefully worked through the diagnostic and treatment process. The entire practice - from the front desk to the vets - have the demeanor of a "family vet" with the knowledge, facility and resources of a high tech hospital. I love everything about them.</Review><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8085bc9a4ecf98a3:0xf0f81f6a257ab671< /GmapID><Time>1477338399360< /Time>< rating>

<Text>The people are very caring. My experience has been that they are thorough but conservative when recommending procedures and treatments.  This is appreciated by both my old friend Murrey and my wallet. I highly recommend this group that truly cares about  your furry friend.<//Text>< name>

<text>We've been going to this highly recommended vet practice since we moved to Novato. About 5 yrs. They are consistently caring and knowledgeable. They have been with us from new pets to old and even through euthanasia. We have a cat that needs ongoing care due to kidney disease, pancreatitis, and thyroid problems. It's a balancing act when he is 17 years old, and they have done a great job of it.
All of the staff is amazing and capable and friendly and caring. Everything you could possibly want for the care of your pets!</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x8085bc9a4ecf98a3:0xf0f81f6a257ab671< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Moved to Novato a year ago so I had to change Vets. SNAH is wonderful. Dr Newman is a awesome caring Vet. She explains what's wrong and what needs to be done to help your pets. I highly recommend them< /Review>

<Review>I have been going to SNAH for three years, where they have treated both of my dogs since puppyhood for both maintenance and emergency care.  I have found their attention, care and support --from office staff to the vets --to be stellar. It wasn't until I took my cat there for a routine urinary tract infection that I realized something very important about SNAH: their philosophy is to look for and rule out worst-case scenarios at all times. (As my present 12-year-old said, "it's like going to the dr w a sore throat and being checked for cancer!") I made the decision to leave SNAH following this appointment, but it's not because the care and expertise isn't excellent; it was because I realized I need a vet that both listens and hears me, as the advocate of my pet. In their defense, part of this is a result of their organization system, in that you do not have  an assigned vet per se; I have only seen one of the three vets they advertise as veterinary staff on their web page in the three years I've been there, as a result of newer vets there.  (I'm a huge fan of both Drs Newman and Ortiz.)  What I learned during this last visit was my explaining what my cat had (UTI) fell on deaf ears, with the vet (again, one I'd never met) trying to charge me $893.00 to look for blockages, when Brix had no symptoms--something the vet made clear but insisted on looking for because of his gender and age.  In the end when I pointedly asked her to try and treat him conservatively first, w antibiotics, given these were mirror symptoms to previous infections, she refused--explaining what she learned in vet school : "not to knock other vets but I was trained to look for everything....  bc I am his advocate." That's when I realized there is the difference between SNAH and myself, bc I believe I am my pets' advocate.  Towards this end, I left, took Brix to another vet and was prescribed Clavamox.  Brix was back to normal the very next am; days later, you'd never know he was sick.

So while it may seem strange that I'm recommending SNAH when I have chosen to leave, I share this because I think it's important that you know their philosophy; if you are okay with SNAH assuming the role of your pet's advocate, then this is your place. However, if you believe you are your pet's voice, and you need to know you'll be both listened to and heard no matter who is on call, my suggestion is you  find a vet that has a regular doctor.  Should you ever need emergency care, I still wholeheartedly recommend SNAH.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
The staff at South Novato Animal Hospital are THE BEST! I had been going there for years for my rescue pug Gus. Dr. Koalska was his primary vet, but all the vets and staff are fantastic at what they do! When we lost Gus, they guided us and comforted us. We miss our little boy. Now 2 1/2 years later I'm excited to return to South Novato Animal Hospital with our new adoptee Oscar. I highly recommend South Novato Animal Hospital to everyone I know that has dogs or cats. Staff are truly talented and caring...clearly loving animals and always doing their best for our furry friends/family members' care and well being. So grateful.</Review>

He is great at assessing people , and I always listen to him because he must like the people I entrust with his healthcare . Dr Newman was amazing . We loved Hailey and Tori , and they made us feel comfortable straight away . Sully didn't  mind lounging on the examination table and  the hospital was super clean . Sully rarely eats out of a strangers hand, and he ate out of both Hailey's hand and Dr Newman's hand . If you are looking for a competent place to take your furry children , then look no further because this place rocks . I read a few other reviews ,and I want to say that the prices are comparable to other places .  We were pleasantly surprised . I am so grateful to everyone for providing great healthcare to Sully . Thanks to everyone for providing amazing healthcare to my superstar .< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
4.6 stars?  South Novato provides top notch care for my dog.  Found in Mexico homeless, I adopted him from MHS.  He was 5 yrs old, and today is 16.  Dr Kawalska is his Doc and Ana his vet tech.  They are wonderful to Thor and sensitive to his anxiety.  Personally I recommend South Novato as the best care provider possible.  Walking in the door you immediately know you and your love are important.  For me, there is no other choice than South Novato. Five stars are not enough!

I wouldn't come here to get anything done.
There are tons of better places in the area and the money is just not worth such a bad job.
Here was my experience:
I got a basic pedicure and callus treatment (which wasn't really a callus treatment at all). My nails were poorly shaped, barely filed and even the polish looked bad.
Nail technician was very rough with me, did not use the correct color that I picked out, and was on her phone WHILE she was working on me. Not talking on the phone, like looking at her phone and scrolling with one hand.< /Text>

<name>Family Coppola</name><Review>Mom had a pedicure & the tech “couldn’t find” the color she wanted. Not a huge deal but is important.

I had a full fill manicure. I had to ask 4 times to make them shorter. My biggest complaint is that I noticed a big defect in one nail. I was halfway home so didn’t have a chance to go back to get it fixed.

Would also say they are on the high side for charges. Basic pedicure + fill manicure was $87+tip. Our normal place is $55+tip. So I paid more and had a subpar experience.

Would not recommend.<//Review><Response>None<//Response><rate>3<//rate>< gmap_id>

It’s a decent nail shop, kind of rush their nails. The quality is hit or miss depending on which nail technician you get. I wish they were all consistently great. I always enjoy the pedicures! Sometimes my nails are okay but most of the times they’re bad (orange). I also bring my daughters here and they also prefer a certain nail tech for their nails to come out how they want. Otherwise I only recommend pedicures here. I had to get my nails redone and pay again at another shop days after.< /text>

I use frequent this nail shop when I first moved to the area and the service was wonderful! I hadn’t been in a while, but visited recently and got a “Deluxe Pedicure.” The person providing the pedicure was very rushed, distracted, and kept walking all over the salon, and looking at her phone excessively. I’m also not sure why this person thought it was acceptable to paint my nails prior to applying the exfoliant and cooling gel??! In addition they kept asking if I wanted a gel pedicure several times to which I replied “no” as the gel/curing is too harsh on my nails. I know this person heard me, completely disregarded what I said and proceeded to get the gel lamp. This was a extremely annoying because I already knew what service I wanted and asking someone the same question over and over again because you simply want to sell them a service is unacceptable. I will not be returning here as the service was not professional and therefore unacceptable.<//text>

The experience was nice they will do your fill-in while you get a pedicure but the pedicure is extremely quick and it’s doesn’t allow you to enjoy it. The guy who did my nails messed them up badly it looked like I needed a fill once he was done and I was very disappointed. My nails looked so bad with all the glue on them the owner tried to fix it but I was disappointed. I won’t be coming back to this salon.</Review>

No such thing as an "appointment". Did not do my manicure same time as pedicure, as I was told they would when I called to make sure I could get in and out fast. It took 2 and a half hours to complete both. So, I've spent $80 on gel that is chipping and lifting after 2 days. The skin around my nails feels inflammed and is super dry and peeling. I was unhappy the last time I went. Should have lerned my lesson then.</review>

I came here hoping for the best.  The look of the shop is nice and the technician that I had was kind.  The problem for me was that my nails came out very uneven and for the price I was very disappointed.  The shape that I showed him for my acrylic nails was not executed well at all.  I hoped for better. Unfortunately, I will not return and they are right up the street from my house :(.</text>

I can only speak to pedicures here because that’s all I ever get, but everything was clean and good today. The lady doing my pedicure was nice and did a great job. I got the $28 spa pedicure and that included having my feet sit in some gel solution, the cheese grater on my rough spots, a leg massage and the massage chairs are a great treat too!
They are charging a $5 extra fee for COVID which they have signs posted on the door and the lady had me ready the notice too before she started my pedicure so there was no surprises there.
I would definitely come back here for another one!</text>

I went to Niki nails today 9/8. This is only the second time I’ve been. The first time I went over a year ago, terrible. Today, terrible. Nothing has changed.

My pedicure was outside which I know COVID guidelines however I paid regular spa pedicure prices for a pedicure that was done in a bowl. My pedicure was rushed as well. 48$ wasted.

Now for my nails, they’re terrible. They’re all shaped differently I asked for square. No where near square. Lengths don’t match. Just an all around terrible job. I was telling him what to fix and it only seemed to get worse.

While I was there there was an altercation, my nail tech was arguing with other nail techs and a  customer stormed out of the shop. My nail tech
Kept getting up and leaving yelling at the other workers. It was very unprofessional

I will never go back here.</Text>

First time here and Last,  Firs $5 for COVID-19? Is that even legal?? I did read about the extra $5 and I was willing to pay to get all the procedures that were described in the regular pedicure. Hot towel ? They did not use a clean hot towel instead a towel laying in the table next to her. Don’t waste your time discussing because they will just act like they don’t understand what you are saying. Take your money elsewhere</Text>

<review>I walked in, no appointment and was welcomed into a very cute, chic salon. Hand sanitizer was readily available along with a sink and handsoap near the entrance. All employees were wearing masks and there was only 2 other guests in the salon at the same time. I went with a picture of what i wanted ( I got a full set, acrylics) and Niki took a quick look and handled her business! I was blown away, she did better than the picture I took in. I wasn't planning on it but I got a  pedicure too (by another lady at the salon). The slightest mistake (I didn't even catch it) and the women cleaned the product and re-did it. I also got a brazilian wax and Niki was very gentle and extremely thorough. All services was at a very fair price. All employees were super friendly. Its been 3 weeks and my acrylics are in perfect condition besides growing out. I don't even live in the area and I'm for sure going back for my fill because I know the service is QUALITY! Go check her salon out. You wont be disappointed.< /review>< time>

<text>9 months pregnant told me to come back in an hour,  called to make sure they could take me before heading over after waiting, they told me 45 more minutes, waiting 45 more minutes then showed up and told me 30 more minutes. Said nothing more and completely ignored me while I sat and waited and had to remind them of my appointment.

<Text>Acrylics with gel polish. Absolutely love them, kinda have a tiny crush on my nails at now 🥰😊🥰
Pam did a great job, second time I had her, and I'll ask for her again. She is sweet and talks to me, she remembers things I said before, and remembers colors I have had before too.
I have had acrylics before, years ago, and recently (from a different girl here) and they were too "fat"! The shape and thickness is just perfect for me!! Thank you Pam!!!< /Text>< Resp>

<Text>My experience was ok.  You can definitely tell they are hard up for some cash because throughout my service she kept asking me, "you sure you don't want this or that"..also in the middle of my service a guy comes and hands me a form about covid to sign.  Shouldn't this have been done prior to the start of my service? Its like bait and switch..needless to say I probably won't be returning  .</Text></record></dataset><record>

I've been going to Niki Nails for almost 2 years and love them! They always are so welcoming and accommodating. I always get the papaya pedicure with gel and gel manicure. I've also recently tried the dip manicure instead of gel. It lasted just over 2 weeks like stated by Kim. Great experience each time. I will continue to go back.</Review>

I got a manicure and pedicure. Both were just okay. I do better myself with a 4-sided manicure board. If you go here bring cash or get charged an extra dollar credit card fee.< /review>

I'm told the guy that did them isn't there and I'll have to wait atleast an hour. (If they know this guy does this kind of work, why are they letting him work there???!!!)<//Review>< Response>

<Text>Do not go here!!! First off they are clean. I sat and watch one women go from servicing one person to another with out changing her gloves. The women who did my nail did a horrible job. When I brought my concerns to her attention she acted like she couldn’t understand what I was saying. They over book all of their appointments so you will be waiting. After walking around for a few hours with these nails that I hate, I called and asked if they could just take the polish off so I can get it gone correctly elsewhere. Once I bought it up, I was hung up on and my number blocked<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>My first time here,  but my friend that was with me have been here before.  She agrees that they do a good job, but I just didn't expect an attitude from the lady when she felt that the tip wasn't sufficient enough. Their prices are much higher for a basic manicure here as well.</review>< pics>

The whole store was staring I felt bad for the customer because she was actually very nice and was explaining why. Another reason I won’t come back is because my pedicure and manicure nail polish didn’t last more then a week and I got gel.< /Review>< resp>

<review>Made an appointment a week in advance and still had to wait 45min. The lady didn’t even give me a chance to take off my wedding ring before she threw a glob of hand scrub all over it. I had to go have it cleaned after. The gel on my nails was EXTREMELY thick and all over my skin. And to top it off, I was overcharged and she gave attitude when I corrected her.</review>< Pics>

If I could give a no star I would. Got a pedicure a week ago. The guy idk his name cut my foot with the pumis stone. When I looked down I noticed it was a stone he has used on many people! So a pedicure that I paid 42 dollars for has cost me 25 at urgent Care and 25 for medication for infection. I don't know why these places just can't be regulated so people don't have to go through this. Would never go back< /text>

If I could give them a "0" I would. Do yourself a favor and Do Not waste your time and money in here. The service was HORRIBLE!!! When I returned home I was asked if they couldn't do my nails, because of how awful they looked 😞. Also she asked me to pay before she was done and charged me for the tip. The price list shows $17, but she charged me $20!!! ( no additional service) Also, I could tell that she was talking about me ( body language ), but I couldn't understand because they were speaking in Vietnamese ( So rude!!!) Overall, a bad nail job, and awful costumer service. Never again... I wouldn't go there even if it was free. Worst experience!!!! Don't waste your time or money!!!<//Text>

<Review>I recently moved to the area and broke a nail. So I went to Niki Nails to get it fixed. It was my first time here. I walked through the door and they informed me to come back later in 30 minutes. Not having much else to do and not wanting to drive the 10 minutes home just to drive 10 minutes back I stated I don't mind staying and waiting. The male manicurist turned to the girl he was working on and said "why she don't go home and cook. Her poor husband. Not my wife". I have never been more appalled in my entire life. Obviously I left and went somewhere else to get my nail fixed. The nerve of this nail salon to talk about their customers who are sitting 7-8 feet from them is absolutely incredible. I will never return.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Customer service need improvement....when you're not spending top dollar, the service depreciates.  I left with burning cuticles from carelessness.  They rushed through my pedicure when they realized I wasn't spending more money on my nails. I don't feel good about leaving this review, but I am in hopes that they will read this and take care of every customer, with 100% professionalism no matter what price paid.<//text>

<text>The chair I sat in was very dirty. The lady that did my nails kept filing them, until they were so short, even though I asked her not to file them short at all. Very disappointed, will not return.</text>< pics>

I’ve been here multiple times and had several different technicians do my nails flawlessly. The salon is clean and my nails are always beautiful. I’m surprised by the negative reviews because I’ve had nothing but positive interactions here.<//Text>

<Text>Absolutely one of the worst manicures I have received! I asked for glitter on my ring finger said they wouldn’t do it without putting a base coat of the color down first. You can also visibly see the brush strokes on my nails and bubbles the polish also doesn’t cover all of the nail but be assured it covers parts of my skin.  So end result is it looks like a 5 year old painted my nails.</Text>< Pics>

I go here all the time. Andrew is my fave nail guy and always does an amazing job. He finally talked me into gel polish after having bad experiences with gel and I'm sold. I've had it on for 3 1/2 weeks with no chips or anything and I'm super hard on my hands and nails. I don't really care for the pedicures as they are a bit overpriced for what they give you and it's not the greatest service for feet. But nails are awesome.<//Text>

<text>Went in for a manicure and a pedicure decided to skip the mani after the girl who did my toes cut them down to nothing to where they were burning and literally cut open and bleeding when I tried to address multiple times that she was hurting me she acted as if she understood the universal word for ouch applies. When I told them I no longer wanted the manicure and wanted to speak with somebody about the severe hacking of my toenails they still charged me the full price for the pedicure and the extra dollar for using my debit card. They tried blaming it on a language barrier but like I said ouch is a universal word so is visual blood and cuts.<//text>< UserId.>

<review>This is a newer nail salon in Menifee on Haun road/Newport rd  near Petsmart.
They do a great job here usually for all kinds of nails whether it be a manicure, acrylic nails, or something else. Good pedicures too.   They have the big massage chairs with the tubs down by your feet. Everyone is very friendly and the prices are reasonable, but they do get very crowded so you might find a wait, even with an appointment.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I went in for a full set acrylic, gel. 3 days later my polish starting peeling and cracking and there was a tom of air bubbles! I went in to get them fixed and they told me they were too busy to help me and the guy who did my nails would have to be the one to fix them and they didnt know when he would be in. So I paid $50 plus tip for my nails to not even last a full week!!! Never coming back.< /Text>

Horrible place, and bad customer service. They don’t even deserve the one star they are getting. They took advantage of my teenage niece by overpricing her for her nails with their ALREADY expensive prices. and not even doing a good job and being rude.  I would never recommend anyone to go here<//review>

<Text>I went to this loction the day before yesterday to get a full set of acrylic nails, and first of all, the lady who did my nails was incredibly rude and impatient. When she applying them they were stinging underneath for some reason. Anyway TWO days after I left one of my ACRYLIC nails popped off!!!! That should not happen. I want my money back now. Do not go here if u would like good acrylics and service.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc9d8963db02b7:0xbc12f85421b5649f< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Horrible place when I went there with my mom today they said the wait was going to be 20 mins. We ended up waiting 45 mins, I ask the lady to warm up my water and the water got way colder. I also asked to get a design with 3 stripes on 1 nail and about 8 dots in my other finger. Then the lady asked the lady next to her about the designs and she said I can't get a design if I get a design it will be a flower with 3 dots. So I tell her I don't want a design then. The my mom got coffen shaped nails for $40 for a full set. My mom asked why is this $40 they said they charge $5 for shaped nails with a pedicure. When my mom and I were finished we go to the cashier and he said $25 for my manicure and $20 for my pedicure and he said $35 for my mom's manicure and $20 for my mom's pedicure then +$5 for the shape. The guy pulled out his caculater and adds all the numbers up and my mom spent $94 on 4 things. Horrible place me and my mom will never go here EVER again I rate this place a 1 star.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
DISRESPECTFUL STAFF- My 93 year old mother was treated  very disrespectfully by manicurist. While she was kept waiting in water to do mani-pedi too long she had to use restroom and accidentally smudged her 2 nails after the girl was done . This manicurist actually scolded my Mother  in front of everyone in the shop for smudging a nail after being kept waiting in water for over an hour and half  !! This place is over priced and they charge a dollar service fee to swipe your card. This is so they can encourage people to pay cash and AVOID paying taxes!! = RIP OFF for tax purposes !!
I will never go there again!<//Review>

I did a review 2 days ago about how I would love to give the girl who did my nails 5 stars and the one who did my toes 0.  I had to update that I came back to get a refund and I wanted to go somewhere else.  The refund is impossible and let me just say, I am sitting here getting them redone as the girl stares more at the TV than my toes. Come on people! If I didn't have an event I would stand up and leave.<//text>

<text>The first time I took my 15 year old in here to have her eye brows and nails done they burnt her face with the wax right before military ball. When I went right back in less than 5 min later they told me it wasn't them. Had the receipt to prove. No sorry no refund which I wasn't expecting but just wanted to bring to their attention the wax may have been too hot and to be careful. They did a good job on her nails so decided when it came time for a fill or new set we would go back. BIG MISTAKE! ! She went in today with her grandmother and myself.  When asked the price we were told $25. They charged her to remove old set (which only needed to be filled) charged for her color that was NOT gel and charged for the "coffin" or square shape. Non of which we asked for or agreed to. In the end she paid $43 not the $25 we had repetitively been told during our visit today. When questions ed the male manager basically told me she was stupid and that we were liars and refused to talk about it. She didn't want to continue to stay there so she paid for a service she was unhappy with. Lesson learned...we will go back to lake nails where they actually listen to their customers and don't charge for services not asked for<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Second time at Niki Nails in the Marketplace off of Haun. The technicians are the rudest, most unfriendly women I have ever experienced. Judgemental, talk about you in their native language and joke and laugh about you. I will not make the mistake of going back a 3rd time!< /Text>

I picked a color and the lady had the nerve to tell me it’s not my color. My gel manicure was chipping after 1 week. The lady doing my pedicure messed up the nail on my big toe and now it’s sore and swollen. I will never go back!< /Text>

<text>Dont waste your money coming here, worst place to go, never going back there! I had been going there for almost a year and until today I felt I had been making a terrible mistake for going back and seeing Andrew for my nails. He was rude and through a fit infront of all the customers saying how he wasted his time doing my nails mind you I paid for my nails and waited for an hour to be seen. And it had not been the first time I  wait for him over an hour with an appointment scheduled.  As he said he will no longer take my appointments.
Overall the staff is very rude and unprofessional some girl techs come in wearing short dresses and see through shirt as if they are going to the club!!!!!    I will no longer come or recommend this place to ANYONE</text>< pics>

Tried to go back in today (1/1/17) and they are closed and I'm leaving for a week tomorrow so I can't get it fixed..on top of the horrible color on one of my nails the paint is coming off like a bad press on. Super pissed!!!! Also the other lady messed up my French pedicure by carelessly putting the pink top coat over the white tips on SOME toes..rookie move!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOya7uvERejDfEOk4dXb_Tq1vTIoyY-Vpcs239d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc9d8963db02b7:0xbc12f85421b5649f<//gmap_id></record>

I had a horrible experience they left my nails bulky, dirty, and with nail polish from before no matter how many times I corrected them, and even mocked me when I wanted something fixed, they painted a different color from what I chose and when I walked outside i hated the color more so walked back in for a color change and they tried to charge me $15 more dollars from an already $33 for just a fill! I walked out extremely disappointed and will never be going back!<//Review>

Twice I've tried this place and twice my nails chipped way too quickly. Once I got a gel mani and chips started showing up only 2 days later, yesterday I got a regular pedi and I've already gotten a chip. Anywhere else  my salon pedis last months and my gel manis over 2 weeks.

Whoever did my mani yesterday was also very rushed and barely paid attention to the quality of my color. There were splotchy streaks and I had to instruct her to do another layer to make the color even. If I wanted a rushed uneven pedicure I can diy at home.< /Text>

<Date>1500132984926<//Date><Rate>2</Rate><review>Overpriced. $70 for a fill with gel polish and a basic pedicure also with gel polish. Toes came out good. Still a little rough on the bottom but overall okay. Nails on the other hand. Horrible! The guy who did them was so rushed and wasn't even paying attention. He kept looking around and talking to other employees. Gel polish got on my cuticles and parts of my nails didn't even get any color. All for $70!! Ridiculous. I honestly feel like going back and asking them to repaint my nails. But they'll probably charge me for a new paint job. There goes another $20. Maybe I'll go somewhere else next time. 😔< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I went to get my nails done for first time today and they didn’t even color my nails all the way and asked them if they can re color parts that had no color and they were being rude and so I went to pay with my nails looking all bad and told lady at front desk and she was giving me attitude told me oh well u have to pay it and And she was being so rude raising her voice at me so I had pay for nails that didn’t even come out I wouldn’t recommend this place to no one and also another lady was getting her nails done next to me and they kept hurting her with the tools like 5-6 times not ever going back< /review>

Guy wasn't paying attention to my feet. I had to ask him to fill the bowl with water. He was too quick. Said he put lotion and massaged my legs and he didn't. He insisted he did. Why would I say he didn't.< /Review>

Leticia was quick to respond and so professional. She fixed our iPhone battery charger in record time for good value. Much better than having to pay for a new phone! T-Mobile recommended this store. Thank you for your great job!</Review>

<text>Mike Is a great guy. If you need a phone repair I would definitely recommend heading over to RepairAll. The price for the repair may be a little more, but nothing beats having great customer service that you can trust if you end up finding a button or something goes out after the repair. Not that common these days to find that in a business.< /text>< resp>

<review>On Saturday night I spilled some water on my iPhone. I thought no biggie & just wiped it off. A few hours later my phone completely shut down and started going in and out of re-boot. I tried everything I found online like hard-reset and even updated by connecting to iTunes. No-luck, iTunes was trying to force me to do a factory reset. This wasn’t an option for me because I would lose all my work on my phone. I started searching Yelp for a phone repair.... it was Saturday night and 9/10 spots were closed the following day (Sunday) but not repair all. I requested a quote through Yelp and got a response within 5 minutes to bring the phone in the following day on Sunday @11am to their Manteca branch. I dropped off my phone wotofo Leticia and she took care of it for me. She opened my phone and repaired the water damage. My phone is good as new and she charged me only $50 for it. Thank you for the wonderful service.<//review>< gmapID>

I went here because of there rating and wasn’t disappointed. I had just went somewhere else ( manteca computer services) and had some faulty screen replacement that ended up frying my motherboard and top it all off screen didn’t work properly.... So I explained my concern and frustration and the young lady here assured me she could fix and she had it fixed in 30 min unlike other place that took a week also said I would have a year warranty on the screen, so super happy wish I would have went there to begin with< /text>

Went in today to repair my granddaughter’s iPhone.
Was helped by Luis, who provided excellent customer service. He was helpful and very patient. He also helped me restore the phone after he repaired it and was friendly during the process.  I will definitely be back.< /Review>

So my phone got stepped on and my phone stopped working completely, first it was a blur then it would not turn back on. It was my first time taking it in and the customer service Greg provided was absolutely great! I thought it was going to take a while to get my phone fixed but it ONLY took 30 minutes and the price was reasonable! He did forget to give back my screen protector back because he had to leave as soon as my phone was fixed due to a family emergency ☹️ But overall, I would highly recommend this place if anything happens to your electronics.< /Text>

Called 45 minutes before they closed, Luis assured me he could replace the screen on my granddaughter's iPhone 7 if we could get there soon. Now 20 minutes later we were there and it's Luis replaced the screen and the world was perfect once again. We've dealt with a lot of repair stores, this was by far the most efficient and affordable, we will be back!!!</Text>

A couple weeks ago on Friday I brought my laptop with a replacement battery to be picked up the next day.  Prior to closing I received a call informing me that I had the incorrect battery and the technician provided me with specifics from the battery in my laptop, which I was able to look-up on Amazon. A week later the correct replacement came so I returned with my laptop and was able to pick it up Saturday afternoon. I appreciate the quick turnaround, I’ve noticed an improvement over the past few days.< /review>

Claudia made sure I did not leave without a good protector case and screen protector. whatever questions i did have she was able to answer them. She even went above and beyond to help us in our time of need. I highly recommend this repair shop.</text>

Very fast and always courteous staff. Always able to fix any device I bring into them. Fast turn around time and very reasonable with prices. I recommend them to all my friends with tech device issues regarding phones, tablets, computers, laptops, and even game council's.< /text>

Came in twice earlier with an unresponsive phone screen, very professional, wonderful service and only took them a few minutes to fix it. The man at the desk was very polite and I will be recommending this place to anybody who needs their devices fixed.<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Bryan was great, service was perfect some of these reviews on here are horrible, if your device is non function when you take it in, liability is on you if something is not working. Bryan quoted me over the phone for a screen and battery replacement on my iPhone, he was able to get me in right away, he kept me updated along the way which I thought was nice, phone was repaired and I had it back in a few hours, he even gave me a discount for replacing both items at the same time. Their policies are written out in the shop, as is their warranty, read it. I’ve already recommended this place to a few people.</review>< UserId.>

I was so excited to find my screen was not broken, but just the tempered glass screen protector I had bought here a few months ago.  I was so happy, I bought a screen protector for that phone and for another family member.  Claudia was superb in service and professionalism!<//Text>

Last night my iPhone XS Max screen got shattered, I was looking for a repair shop, and found this shop. I walked in and Talked to Moe, although I didn’t have an appointment, he was able to take me in and was helpful and told me my phone was going to be ready in an hour. I left my phone and returned later. My phone looks and feels brand new! Moe even helped my find a better tempered glass screen protector with better warranty then Zag. Prices were more than fair and I would come back the moment I have an issue with my phone or iPad!<//Text>

Brought my phone in to get the charging port fixed. My screen worked just fine. When I went to pick it up the screen was broke. The guy working said since the phone was dead when I brought it in we couldn’t do pre tests to make sure the screen wasn’t broke they wouldn’t replace it. I know for a fact the LED part of my screen was just fine along with the outer part of my screen. He offered a discount on the screen even though he “didn’t break it.” I would recommend going somewhere else because who knows how many things they  “didn’t break” then offer to fix for a small discount later.</review>

Phone screen is acting up and having a hard time responding to touch. Sometimes it will be fine but then it won’t let me press my screen and use my phone. I never had this problem until I got it fixed and it’s messing with my day-to-day usage. Even just typing this message it is causing me to constantly go back and fix what I have typed because it is not typing some of the letters. I even reset my phone thinking that would help but it didn’t. I am Very disappointed with the service, not worth the money spent on it.<//Text>

<Review>I recently dropped my iPhone & cracked the screen—again! Having done this two previous times, I was well acquainted with the process of having the screen replaced. I was pleased to find RepairALL within 10 min. of my home instead of having to drive to the next larger town. Not only was it convenient, the repair gentleman was delightful/knowledgeable and quickly replaced my screen (& case) for a very reasonable price! I am pleased to give RepairALL my highest recommendation!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x8090419fdd420aed:0xdf55209257e51f99<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The staff are very helpful and friendly. One employee, I believe his name is Ke’Shaun, replaced my phone screen in a matter of minutes and explained the process as he took it apart. They also have a pretty nice selection of cases and accessories. I definitely recommend RepairAll to anyone who needs phone repair!<//Review>

First visit they were courteous,  fast service, affordable prices

Had a second visit to have a tablet fixed. Parts had to be ordered. It took to two phone calls and a visit to find out after 4 weeks that the parts were never ordered. After a total of six weeks to get it back.</review>

<text>Went in for warranty claim because the screen on my iPhone was acting up after a few months when they replaced it. I was promised that it was under warranty and will be replacing for free. Came back 45 minutes later to check on the status then Keshawn told me that my screen had a big scratch which was not there before I gave him my iPhone so he said that the warranty is void. (ended up paying $83 for a new replacement screen) on top of that I was never given a receipt because he claimed that he ran out of ink on his printer. Really? What kind of business are you running here?! I will never ever go back to this place ever again because they don’t treat their returning customer right!<//text>< Pics>

Knowledgeable, courteous young lady that helped me. She stopped what she was doing and gave me her undivided attention. Answered all questions ( pricing, sizes and etc)
Nice place. Looks like they have every type of case and screen protector that one would need.<//text>

My last visit for a repair was positive. The technician was very responsive and went the extra mile to  make adjustments that did not even concern my main issue. I left feeling confident that my phone was repaired and was actually working better than when I went in. This technician was a young female and I don’t remember her name but I highly recommend her.  She worked quickly, proficiently, and seem to truly care about what she was doing.<//Text>

I wanted to buy something to say thanks and help keep this business growing.  So I bought a charging cable!!! Thanks Greg!!

I thought I would have to get a whole new phone after I dropped mine this last time. I called around to get quotes on my phone and found out that RepairAll was the only repair store to offer a free diagnosis in the area. So I took my IPhone 6 to RepairAll  the next day as soon as the store opened. I could tell that Gregory knew what he was doing because he fixed it within 15 minutes! The repair was affordable and the customer service was excellent. I definitely give it 5 stars!</text>

<review>Myra is a genius. she took what I was under the impression to be a total loss (iPhone 6s plus) that was cracked, frame bent, LCD screen looked like a colorful inkblot, with water mixed in, and in about 35 minutes returned to me a brand new phone. I cannot say this enough this place is awesome! For those of you who dont have insurance on your devices, and cant afford the 900+$ to replace it, Go to repair all! Talk to MYRA shes amazingly talented and super helpful and polite. 100% in customer service!<//review>< pictures>

Honestly, now I won't go anywhere else. My phone screen completely shattered on the kitchen floor. I called on a whim and I couldn't ask for more! Excellent customer service, affordable prices, super helpful and got my phone fixed in minutes! I definitely recommend!!</text>

I had talked to someone two days prior to coming in to get my screen fixed and was offered a good deal, called after a few days talked to someone new and asked about what the other guy had offered and he said he would honor it, I thought that was pretty awesome! Super fast, only took 20 minutes to fix and not super expensive like other places! Very nice as well. Highly recommend my screen looks good as new!!</Review>

The store is super clean & organized - they're always available & ready to assist. Repair costs very reasonable and are completed in a timely matter.  This is the part that sets RepairALL above it's competition - no matter if they get my business or not, I know Greg & staff will guide me into the correct direction.</Review>

Thank you so much.  The repairman was very personable and very capable.
This is the second time my phone had acted up.  The first time I cracked the screen; when it want working properly after several months I took it back.  Everything was totally covered by warranty.</Review>

<Review>I went in and he took 30 minutes to repair my phone which I thought was a little odd because most places say 2 hours. When I got my phone back my screen was ghosting and he repaired it again that day in 30 minutes again. My phone works perfect now great service and prices< /Review>< UserId.>

My IPhone went for swim for about an hour and a half. Got a new phone, however, I saw this store next to the AT&T store and thought I will let them look at the damaged phone. Free estimate with 30 minutes and 2 hours later my phone was fixed. Just restored the software at home and the thing worked perfectly. I wouldn’t of bought a new phone if I talked to these guys first. Also couldn’t ask better professionalism.</review>

2nd time in for service. Yes, I dropped it AGAIN.
I cannot say enough for their business and service,
Honestly!
Last time in I purchased a new screen. I was told a screen protector could save my screen from cracking, so I had them put one on.
When I dropped my phone, I could see the glass was shattered.
I brought it in to have the glass replaced and when the gentleman removed the screen protector, I was shocked. For once, I had been sold something that actually worked. I had a new screen protector placed and my phone is like new again.
I would recommend this company to all. You will not be disappointed.</text>

<Text>Really great customer service! I messaged Repair All Phone Repair and another local phone repair shop through the maps app with my phone info and what I needed fixed. Repair All promptly replied within 30 minutes with a quote and also notified me that the part would have to be ordered. The other place read my message, but never answered. So I went in store to Repair All and paid, about a week later I got a text saying my part was in. I called and asked if they had time to fix it now. Dropped it off and an hour later was ready to go. Employee even left the protective plastic on there, and left it up to me if I wanted to take it off or leave it on, which is a nice gesture in my opinion because I know some people who do like to leave it on. Basically, I would DEFINITELY recommend that you go here for any phone repairs.<//Text>< pics>

I was referred to this shop by the ATT store almost a year ago. . I am a repeat customer and I will continue to use this repair shop for all my electronics. I needed a screen replaced on my iPhone 6. Repaired while I waited and with the coupon the cost was $30 less than batteries plus. Recently had another phone fixed and was given a generous discount for an inconvenience caused by a new employee. This shop stands behind their customers with courtesy and great service, I would recommend this shop to everyone.</Text>

<review>The screen on my iPhone 6 was severely broken with dark lines going on the side of the screen, making it impossible to see or use the right side of the keyboard.

I definitely recommend this place! I just got my phone fixed today by Greg. He finished in less than an hour and the price is so worth it. I called other shops that were charging me a ridiculous price but this place is reasonable and  Definitely your pennies worth (:< /review>< Name>

Couldn’t go back until next day. Store did not have another battery. I was told delivery would be in about 2 and to call back at 2:30. I called at 3 and was told, oh yes it’s here, I’ll get right to it. 5 minutes later I received a call that this battery was bad also. The manager drove from Manteca store to Modesto store and got another battery. I finally got my iPhone back with a good battery installed at 7:00pm. Manager was very apologetic and made extra effort to get me my phone back. Maybe they need to change their source of batteries.< /review><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

They screwed up my son's phone. Came in for a cracked screen. Came back to pick it up and they told us the black face they had for his phone was defective and it was their last. They then talked us into going with a white face temporarily. Another hour went by and it didn't work either. They put my son's cracked screen back on and told us to come back. As we were on our way home, my son noticed that now his home screen didn't work either. Went to batteries and bulbs today and got it fixed right in under and hour.<//review>

Can't recommend this place enough.  John was absolutely wonderful in dealing with my son's broken screen and camera. Fixed quickly and job was very professionally done. 5 stars well earned!< /Text>

I broke my phone screen and use my phone for business and needed to get it fixed. I went to RepairAll in Manteca on Hulsey road and they fixed it within minutes! I also invested in a fireproof case for better better protection and they gave me a great discount on the case and $10 off for signing up on their rewards program! They were great and I’d strongly recommend the guys at RepairAll! Thank you!!!</Text>

The guy was super nice and quick, the only reason I’m giving 4 stars is because the first screen he put on was defective and he had to replace it again. I would just say check your new screen before you leave. But all in all, we had a good experience!< /Text>

I broke my iPhone screen and wasn’t sure if there was more damage because before the screen cracked all the way my phone glitched out terribly, so today after my daughters soccer game I went to this location to get a quote and after speaking to the technician he told me that they could do a free diagnostic which was great because I wasn’t sure if I need a new phone or just a new screen. The diagnostic was done in less than 10 minutes and it turned out I just needed a new screen (great news) so I was in and out within 30 minutes which is notable because I couldn’t get an appointment with Apple until a week and a half from today! The technician was super friendly and made the whole experience wonderful from beginning to end..the apple store is good at what they do BUT as far as expedited repairs and customer service they are lacking.  I will be taking our phones here from now on not just based on that but the price as well!  I don’t always leave reviews but when I do it’s because the service was above and beyond or extremely lacking in quality and I’m happy to say that this was a great experience and have already told family and friends about it!
-thank you again!<//text>

Going to Repairall in Manteca was
a great experience. Greg, the store
Manager, is a very personable and
Knowledgeable representative who
repaired my antiquated 5 iPhone
with 30 minutes, after advised by
my carrier to just get a new phone.

Well great customer service never
never goes out of style and I highly
recommend the repair service of
Repairall</text>

<review>I waited 2 hours to jus be told my daughters phone had a touch disease, meanwhile at least 5 other people came into the store an the young man working alone was unable to fix any of the phones, I personally feel he doesn't know what he's doin an should receive more training, I'm quite upset I wasted that much time, for him to tell me to contact apple, very disappointing, if the staff isn't trained properly this business we be closed down in no time..< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>
