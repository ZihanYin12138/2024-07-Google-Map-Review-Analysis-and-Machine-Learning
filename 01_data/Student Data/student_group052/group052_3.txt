Easy to find a spot on their reservation system to workout.  You can reserve one day ahead and the app reminds you.  Another unfortunate good thing is that it is not crowded and the staff is more friendly.  All the members are good about being courteous and maybe half wipe the equipment.  I am so happy to be back at the gym!< /text>

Why ‘facility’ t shirt guys forcing people to wear shoes when people doing deadlift in the rack?? Would you not bother me and other people if I wear a deadlift slipper??  I have a deadlift slipper but it looks literally same as socks. Management should tell their staffs to leave gym members workout freely what they want unless it annoying other gym members.</review>

<Response>None</Response><text>I'm enjoying working out there, equipment is in good condition and the staff are friendly and helpful, however, there should be some protocol for people who spend a majority of their time sitting on the equipment looking at their phone. I'm there to work out and get out as quickly as I can. When I have to wait for the equipment, I have to change my routine and or skip something. It may be petty of me but I only have so much time and if that is my take, there may be other's who feel the same.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

The equipments are good but the area for lifting is just too close to one another. This location is always crowded. My home location is in automall and I prefer their Sauna and Steam Room temperature better compared to this branch because the temperature here in milpitas is not that hot at all. I just come here sometimes because it's closer and there are new equipments that are not available in the automall branch🙃.</review>

<review>So many questions when I use this place. If we all work out here why do people trash the bathroom  and make it so dirty? Why did they take away towels? We were sold on it as a service for supersport weren't we? Why have people pushing contraption (sorry lack of a better word) on the main walkway? Why are people talking at the top of their voice on their headset when working out, in their jeans? I like the convenient locations but man the first chance i get im quitting this chain.< /review>< Name>

If management were smart (and I sure hope they are), access to the Club by undercover law enforcement would not only be welcome but ENCOURAGED as cost-free membership so they can catch any lowlifes who may view the locker rooms and premises as an open invitation to steal the property of other members. Being a member of a gym is a PRIVILEGE and not a right. We PAY for our property and we PAY for our inclusion in this community: make it RIGHT. The Fitness team should keep a time, date, description and contact log for all incidents of theft. Find any lowlifes who do it so they can be prosecuted and BANNED FOR LIFE. Thanks so much! (Now watch the likes.)<//review>

<Review>ANOTHER SUPER SPORT FACILITY WITH NO TOWEL SERVICE!  Facility has equipments for sports but there’s no towels. I’m paying for the super sport fee w/c the only difference is the additional towel service and there’s no towels whenever I go to all the Bay Area Super sport gyms! Very disappointing when that was the reason why I selected to be in a super sport membership so I don’t have to bring my own towel or buy a new towel(that hasn’t been washed yet and can have the new textile chemical leftovers). I was informed by staff both super sport  in Hayward & Fremont that the company is going green and are eliminating all towel services for super sport. I think that’s absurd. Makes me have to rethink twice if I should be continue and renew on my super sport account. Oh and lastly shower room looks nasty. New facility, but the bathroom Doesn’t look like it’s well kept.< /Review><username>F.N. F<//username>< Date>

Better than decent, 4 power racks, 2 smith machines (the kind where the bar rotates at the saftey stops, which can be bad for your wrists so be wary) a decent sized functional fitness area and 4 universal adjustable cable machines.

<text>They would not allow me to use the 3-day pass that was given to me by a friend. After speaking with 2 different managers, they still didn’t allow the free pass and was pushy for me to sign up right then and there. They didn’t care for me to try out the gym before purchasing a membership.

Yesterday, a bunch of lockers were broken into. Apparently they don’t care for their member’s safety either.

I would not recommend to anyone.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<review>Dirty machines, somewhat clean showers. I (tried to) end my membership in July. They told me it was done, but they didn't process it. I eventually called corporate to end it, in October. They told me someone from that location would call me that week, and I could get a refund. They never called. Eventually I went in to ask for a refund. They refunded October, but not August or September.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. Worst experience ever. I'm a former member of 24 (a few mo's back cancelled), my husband talked me into a 3 day pass so I could see how I liked the (new) location. First off the kid that has to "go through the process" w/ anyone w 3 day pass, was pushy and rude. When I told him I simply wanted to work out he told me if I didn't want to listen to his pitch, I could pay $25 for a day pass. He then connected me with "his manager" Melvin (I could hear and see this kid speaking to the mgr about me). Melvin approached me aggressively rather than a true manager's approach to fix things/make better. He was defensive with me, asked what my plans were after today, to sign up or not. I said I just want to get a feel for it before I decide, it's a 3 DAY PASS!! Long story short, my husband proceeded to the back to get the keys (I wanted him to still enjoy his workout and I'd drive home and come back). I started walking w/ my husband w/ the intent of stopping by the machines when Melvin "so called manager",  loudly said "are you paying the $25?", I said I'm waiting to get keys, he then proceeded to tell me to sit down in an aggressive tone, I said NO I'm standing, he and a couple other meat heads (one was a trainer w/ nothing to do) tried intimidating me by walking back and forth. Until my husband came back to front and cancelled his long term membership due to their treatment of me. Unfortunate but now off to a gym that will be open to taking our business.

Nice new place, and welcoming employees. However, there are only four stations for you to do squatting, overhead press, or deadlift (unless you move to the side and take a BB from another station. Four stations for all three exercises is not enough. The other location has atleast 6-8 stations that you can await, op, or do. Expect to wait for a long time for the racks unless you go early morning.< /Review>

<Text>I was in town on business staying at the Embassy Suites hotel down the street and needed to get my workout in. Staff were rude and condescending.   Facilities were dirty and unmaintained.  My home gym is Fountain Valley in OC and I'm used to a certain level of service, cleanliness, and atmosphere.  This gym is hostile, disorganized and unprofessional.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>This gym is probably the cleanest gym I have been to.  The staff is nice, the Machines are clean, they always have fresh/clean towels. They always have good music playing in case you forget your headphones, and they have tons of TV's showing a range of different channels. I always look at the TV showing UFC fights.

I chose to go to this gym because its close to my house, and boyy was I NOT disappointed.  They have tons of Machines to workout different parts of the body. I come here at 11:30pm to workout about 3 times a week. And it's the perfect time, the gym is not busy at all during these hours.

They have a basketball court, a pool, a hot tub, a sauna, & a steam room!

ALSO* They clean the men's changing rooms from 2-3am.<//Text>< date>

Ignore all the babies complaining about something out for less than a week. The gym is new staff seems nice and equipment is new. My only gripe is that it's one story and cardio is facing the weights w
Which bothers me I guess</text>

Unprofessional and unethical place of business. Do not go here unless you want your private information talked about openly. Decided to cancel my membership after 2.5 years.</text>

<Review>I’ve been a 24 hour fitness member for a long time now, and this was the WORST 24 hour Super Sport I have ever visited.

NONE of the free weights are organized and random weights are scattered everywhere.  80 pound free weights in the 30 pounds, next to that are 15 pound weights, next to those 75 pound weights.  60 pound weights in the 20 pounds and a random 105 pound on the floor by the mirrors.

The staff does NOTHING but play on their cell phones.  I worked out for 1.5 hours and did not see a single employee assist with anything.  I do not live in this area but if I did, I would’ve canceled my membership and joined another gym.< /Review>< Pictures>

I would say for the annual fee that they charge to supposedly keep the gym clean and equipment in working orders, the women's bathroom is nasty, hair on the floor in every square inch and the treadmills and stairmasters are always stain with sweat. If you are going to charge to keep the place clean, please clean it and to top it off if you try to stretch by the windows do not put anything by them because there are always bugs. I had 2 bug bites last Friday by just standing by the windows, too bad im paying to not get a dirty bathroom/equipment and not to see bugs. I used to goi to the one in Jacklin Rd not only I paid less they always had a person constantly cleaning,  i never had a complaint about how clean the place was. I may have to change back to Jacklin if they dont address the issue.< /text>

The staff discriminate, make rude comments and gossip about club members.  This is a direct reflection of the terrible leadership in place.  Someone is either grossly overpaid and under qualified or just doesn't care.<//text>

<Review>From start to finish could not have imagined a better experience. Right from the start, my call was returned within minutes by Rene Lopez. He set up an appointment to assess the leak issue with my 4 post automotive lift. He provided estimates for 2 different options, removed the ram for service, estimated turnaround at a week, was back and reinstalled within 2 days. Rene and his crew worked quickly, efficiently, and cleaned up and tested all functions afterward, including wiping down the entire lift, pump, etc. Would highly recommend their services to anyone. Included itemized invoice! Thanks again to the entire crew.</Review>< pics>

Needed to purchase a check valve for air compressor. The one thing that caught my attention was how knowledgeable the employees are and the customer service is a shining example of how customers should be treated. Thank you Michael for a pleasurable experience and taking the time to listen, making sure I was purchasing the right part.< /text>

Came down to have our Compressor serviced and was greeted warmly by Robert and Michael. I can tell that not only do they have the knowledge but also the caring character that made me feel like more than just another dollar sign. They definitely deserve higher than a 5 star review</Review>

Wanted to take the time to thank Michael Callahan in parts department. He went far and beyond, to take the time to help me. Perry Electric appreciates the hard and dedication.  I can't say the same for other companies, that wasted my time, didn't put any effort to help. Thanks again 🙂< /Text>

Advanced (Joseph Vanderbilt) was so kind to
(when asked to fix an old compressor that was garbage) donate  a new compressor to the
East County Transitional Living Center men’s ranch in DULZURA. His men delivered it, set it up and were such a blessing to the cause.
I know his business ethics are of the utmost importance to him and his company’s mission.
He’s on top of his game and will continue to be successful in all he does.
Thank you brother
I love your show!

CUSTOMER SERVICE appears to be JOB #1.

Field Service Supervisor ROBERT PARKER
Represents his company well.
Personable and Professional.
Got to walk through the Service Department.
Quite a facility. Clean and organized.
Service trucks appeared to be outfitted well.

I’m presently using IR T30 compressor.
When it requires service or needs replacement,
I’ll be calling ADVANCED!

<Text>When I was approached about saving money, I honestly thought of the oldest sales gimmick.  The devise used to monitor the machine did in fact capture my attention, and I took time to think about it.  Many months passed, and I was approached once again about the efficiency of my compressor.  I requested a repeat assessment, and this time I had the prior reading to compare (to verify the legitimacy of the test).
I was assured that the new compressor would in fact pay itself off, and I didn’t believe it.
I ended up making a deal, and a new compressor was installed on time by a very proficient technician.  We had minimal down time because of the planning and expertise in swapping the old compressor with the new.
The new machine is considerably quieter, and as promised, the effective electric saving would pay off the machine in about 24 months!!!
I am very satisfied with the machine, and the most satisfied with not being pressured to make a decision to buy and replace an existing, working machine.
Without any hesitation, I recommend this company to anyone seeking reliable, and efficient service.</Text>< userid>

After 20 years and many hours my compressor decided it was time to retire. I wanted to stay with the same setup...7.5 hp, 80 Gal. tank, 1 phase. Advanced Air & Vacuum have everything from...parts, airlines, hoses, to full service & repair.  I've been in the woodworking industry for 32 years and having an efficient air source is a must in the shop.
I went over to their warehouse and picked out an Atlas 7.5 hp, 80 gal., 1 phase compressor...a real beast! Spoke with Joseph the owner and he worked me a killer deal! The best part was they had it delivered to my shop within a hour and a half....really...that was awesome. I was back up and running in no time.
These guys know air!
Big thanks to Joseph, Michael, Daniel, and Brendan.</Text>

Had a power outage on a Friday night.  Compressor motor wouldn't kick on after power restored.  Advanced Air & Vaccum came out within an hour of calling on a Saturday to fix.  Turned out to be a breaker we were not aware of.  Feel kinda silly we couldn't reset ourselves, but good news the compressor wasn't damaged.  5 stars!< /Review>

<text>Had an air compressor go down, they were out the next day and discovered it was not the part we believed needed to be replaced. Ended up being just a check valve that only a good technician would catch saving us time and money! Would use again and recommend to anyone.< /text>< resp>

Supplied compressed air is a critical component to our business and Advanced Air continues to service our requirements at the highest level. Due to the recent COVID-19 impact, Philips has increased it's production output significantly and additional compressor requirements had to be met. Advanced Air evaluated, developed & installed an upgraded system that exceeded our expectations and provided exceptional performance for our business. Their monthly preventive maintenance and 24 hour on-call service continues to provide stability and consistent functionality to our equipment.
Philips Respironics is a world leader in respirator manufacturing. Our sites are crucial in supporting hospitals foreign & domestic.

I couldn’t happier with the service that this company provided.  We bought two industrial air compressors from them; one primary, one back-up.  The original plan was to string them together with a costly electrical switch.  Bobby from AAV took one look at the plan and called me back a half an hour later with much simpler, yet equally good solution that saved us over a $1000.  I also brought air drops from them and the manager steered me away from the more expensive options to less expensive equipment that was more suited to the quality of our Cu airlines.   The guy that installed everything was very professional and put together everything neat and tight.  I would recommend AAV to anyone.<//Text>

Had spent half the day chasing geese. Every shop I was referred to would send to another company that could not build the air hose I needed.
At The final stop another customer followed me came up with out to the parking lot and suggested I try advanced. Instead of scratching en to thier heads they made it happen-for a fraction of what I expected to pay
.I have to ask myself why the employees at the shops I had been to never mentioned advanced< /Text>

<Text>Shame to me that I haven't been to a baseball game before. And shame to coronavirus that we all cant meet together in such huge places. It has a capacity of more than 60,000 people with 10,000 parking lots. It has the ability to organize performances and shows of any level. Oracle corporation has acquired the rights to rename the stadium for more than $200 million. Incredible
Oracle Fans or the O are the most passionate and dedicated.

Location was really beautiful everybody was nice . The officiant was really good , his words were really touching (my service was in Spanish officiant )
Brenda and her team where awesome . I really recommend it .We  drove 6 hours (Napa valley)to get married here with  our family . Due to covid - we had limited guests but we completely understand healthy and safety come first .  God bless this Beautiful wedding chapel🙏🏼  And  all couples that are looking forward in getting married in this chapel or any other .

I really recommend  it 😍🙏🏼

HORRIBLE! DO NOT RECOMMEND! UNPROFESSIONAL!
If I could give NO STAR, I would.
The officiant that married us wrote over the marriage license that was submitted to the county and of course, we received a letter a month later stating that it had to be resubmitted. I dropped off the paperwork with them because it was their mistake. I ordered 2 marriage certificates and I come to find out that they resubmitted my husbands name incorrectly!! This is beyond irritating. ONE JOB!!!</text>

<Response>{'time': 1600971754042, 'text': "Hello Maria,\n\nThis review you have given us is your opinion we respect it but we don't understand it. There was an erasure that the County Clerk requested we fix which we did. The minister did not write over the marriage license.  Fees to correct that mistake were paid by Guadalupe Wedding Chapel as well as our time assuring we get it right.\n\nAs far as the new mistake. You have to contact the County Clerk. Our copies show that we submitted the correct name of your husband. That is out of our control.\n\nOur job is not only paper work. The mission is to be responsible with our paper work and give the best customer service to marry you."}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

My husband and I celebrated our 10th year wedding vow renewal at Guadalupe Wedding Chapel, such a beautiful venue. Our entire planning experience was amazing. Zayda was an awesome wedding coordinator. She was very professional and made sure our special day was perfect literally. I have no complaints at all.< /review>

We’ve just got married this morning.
Zayda Garcia performed the ceremony in a very professional and fun way :)
Everything went very smooth and nice.
We went out of the chapel husband and wife with a big smiles and some awesome pictures that she took!
Once again thank you!

<text>Worse place to get married. had my wedding a week ago paid about $1,200 they start you off with a cheap price but if you have a photographer go in and take pictures they charge extra like really? Of course you’re going to have all that it’s a special day! If you want your license done by them they charge $100 when I did contract with them the “manager” said after ceremony we were allowed to take pictures inside and one stupid girl said we were only allowed to take 2 pictures I asked her “why?” She then said because we were late my husband was there before 11am and they didn’t let him in because there was another ceremony going on. She was very rude wouldn’t recommend this wedding Chappell to anybody. Yeah it is very nice but to pay all that money for a 30 minute ceremony NO THANKS!!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>Stunning location. My wife had been looking at a few wedding chapels. This Chapel definitely stood out. Our ceremony was performed by Minister Giuliano. He did an amazing ceremony. We loved our service. Thank you<//text><Time>1546393421676<//Time>< user_name>

I had my wedding at this beautiful chapel on June 23rd 2018. I couldn't pick a better place for my special day. The staff is amazing very friendly and helpful, specially Juan he was there for me the day of and prior to the date, always answered my calls, questions and concerns with a pleasant tone. Thank you so much for that Juan!! The Chapel's decoration is simply beautiful, all my guest were so impressed with everything. I would totally recommend this chapel to all my friends and family, and of course to all those future Brides out there!<//text>

<Text>Really bad service! We went to go book our ceremony for my husband and I and they charged us 150 for just to get us married but never told us nothing about the marriage License Until we paid. Told us we will have to go get our marriage license some where else and if we wanted to get it there it will be 185 more . Like what type of place are you guys . If I could of refund my money I would and go get married some were else !! Yea they will charge us more but at least the marriage license a ceremony with all our family and friend .< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Not ashamed to admit it, but when he put me on the spot and asked me to speak from the heart to her, i cried... Our sons were even the witnesses... Would recommend to anyone that is looking for a wedding on a budget... They do it all for ya!!!<//review>< pics>

<text>Worst place to get married they wanna charge you for everything. Place is beautiful but staff is very rude specially the younger  lady with glasses that works there. If your 10 min. late they charge you $100 and keep charging you $100 for every 30 minutes someone is lated and their ceremony just takes 30 minutes . Wont recommend this place bad experience.< /text>< pictures>

First of all parking is horrible. I would not want my guests to go through that. Also when we called for an appointment, after pressing option 1, a woman who answered just said hung up on us as soon as she heard us speak in English. All you had to say was you don’t speak English and we would have switched to Spanish instead or rudely hanging up on us.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I came here twice to "greet and meet" celebrities and twice just to show off. Their bar has good collection, but try to get some couple if you want to feel elevated. Though being an introvert, I could not not praise their discotheque. Their dance floor is also hip, but most of the times I enjoyed drink sitting in a corner. This will always have a spot in my memories as I met someone whom I am a superfan of - in her both different avatars.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Absolutely NO sense of care for the SJ community or their health. ZERO professionalism from management. They DO NOT know at all business etiquette and CAN NOT properly handle customer comments or concerns. The service is so beyond poor. We loved Aura, this place use to be a gem and is now lower then dirt. NEVER waste your precious time or money here EVER AGAIN!! This establishment  is nit worth a penny.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Salsa upstairs, hip hop downstairs. It's not too bad, but I'm going to give them 1 star because they don't stamp and let you back in. $10 isn't horrible, but at 10:30 place was dead and a poor ratio of women to men for salsa dancing.</Text>

<text>If there is another option go there.

The customer service from the doorman/bouncers was poor. They did not pat me down and were sarcastically making comments for no reason.

I did not appreciate how flippant they were when I asked to peek around the corner to see if my friends were inside. They said if you pay you can. My partner paid  and my friends were not there. I asked them what system they used to so I could get food and come back. After we had paid, they informed us, no ins and outs. That wouldn't have matter if they were serving food. They weren't. All in all, this estabilshment is unprepared and lame. I wouldn't go to an event here unless you absolutely had to for some reason.

Thank you for reading my post. Peace and party on.</text><user_id>116333564313256808766< /user_id><pics>None</pics>< Name>

This bar is awful one of the worst clubs bars that I have been to in San Jose the employees are very rude they bump people they cuss people out their security is disgusting because they put their hands on women there is times where they are very disrespectful with their words I experienced it first-hand when I was being asked to leave for something that I've did not do nor was I apart of. One of the bartenders who was working bottle service bumped into my sister and told her to move out the way and pushed her and we stopped her and let her know that that's not okay and apparently we were the ones at fault and was being told to leave and I did not agree considering I paid my money to enter the club I got one drink I went to the restroom didn't get to dance and then was asked to leave I did not agree with that and thought it was very unfair as I went to talk to a security guard about why we had to leave I was told because the bartender said we had to leave that was not a good enough excuse for me so I did not leave but I did continue explaining why I felt it was not fair that we paid but yet we had to leave then shortly after a random security guard came out of nowhere cussing and screaming calling me b****** and saying to get the F out of here and little after that he grabbed me and pushed me twice and I was with two other women after he put his hands on me it went downhill from there and there was several security guards that were fighting with myself and the two women that I was with need I say more that is very unacceptable very unprofessional and I also have pictures of the bruises that were left on my arms and when I called the next day to file a complaint because security guard it is illegal for them to put their hands on anybody let alone three women so I also did not get a call back or anything I even went to get a lawyer for the situation so with that being said I will never ever go back to that place ever again unless they want a lawsuit .< /text>

<review>Really nice place. Scenery was amazing. The DJ set was pretty dope. The front ladies were nice but the bartenders kept chatting instead of helping customers. The floors were really sticky. It was also way to hot. But my biggest problem was the ass hole security gaurds. These dick heads tried to intimate everyone acting like thugs. Overall though I had a fun night. Might be back.</review><name>Spence</name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The music is ok, it’s a good place if you go just to dance. But never get bottle service from these place they charge the entrance fee witch is $20 per person including girls regardless if you have reservation for a table. The entrance security do not know how to do their jobs the club was empty and they would just hold the line outside for no reason. Maybe to make them seem it was full when in reality it was not. Based on my experience in this place it was my first time here and for sure my last. They need new management in this place.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>You will enjoy Aura if:
-You like spending $20 to hear the awesome setlist of a mediocre wedding DJ
-You have a strong sense of nostalgia for the sound system in your ex-boyfriends 1998 Acura Integra
-You appreciate waiting 30 minutes for your turn in a dripping wet cave of a bathroom where you are greeted with the luxury of overflowing toilets and no toilet paper
-You love a 10:1 male to female ratio where the men have both the looks of Gabriel Iglesias and the charm of Chris Brown
-You appreciate the pleasant surprise of touching surfaces that are dripping wet with mystery liquids
-You're emotionally moved by expressionless girls waving around light up sticks with all the enthusiasm and excitement of a funeral procession
-You like waiting 20-30 minutes and paying upwards of $12
for a luxury glass of Purple Drank sugar water
-You like being assaulted by overly aggressive and posessive hood rats who apparently have nothing better to do with their lives than spend $4000 on mid range liquor in the world's saddest nightclub< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
They are so bad. It was first time visit in Sanjose. And we got a free ticket in Avery Lounge. We asked them " is it Avery Lounge?"?and they told us "yes but you should pay. Because our manager said that" and then we paid it. We realized that it's not AL. So we told them to refund it. But they said "sorry we can't". Is it fair?? I got soooo bad impression about their mind.< /Review>

<review>I had a great night the first time i went..5 stars definitely.
I go very often
There are a lot of good things about this place
securities respect you
they are really nice
they let you have fun.
drinks are not expensive
Plus there are hot dogs outside everytime

But the most important thing is the securities  don't mess with you most clubs the securities are Soo annoying that you are just not comfortable.

I wanna say this is one of my favorite clubs in San jo< /review>< pictures>

< review>
Will never go to Aura  again and I will be filing a complaint. Simply put the security, reportedly under the instruction of the management, notably kept Black patrons in line much longer than whites. I also saw them pat down two Black men while they let two white males go straight in. The obese security guard was extremely rude and dismissive and refused to get management when I asked for them so I could complain. I have video and I will be making a civil rights complaint and seeking others who have had similar experiences. This is not 1950.< /review>

<text>its  overpriced in my opinion($20 on the weekends), the music was not all that great. It needed more update music. I felt like I did not get my moneys worth :/  I would say this place for an older crowd than for 21 yr olds.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Ambrose Cafe is a very nice cafe next to Fuller that serves Copa Vida coffee beans (a local roastery).

The space is very open, and the cafe plays music with smooth vibes.

The coffee is great! My favorite is its iced latte with oat milk.

Funny detail. Their coffee cup doesn’t have a handle on it. It’s just a huge Asian tea cup.

Apple Pay and Ambrose Pay both accepted.</Text>

<review>We sat outdoors and I really liked it. It has heaters so you won't get cold and lights dangling above so light isn't much of an issue. Although I didn't stay too late into the evening. Great part is that there is a free parking structure right across the street!</review>< pictures>

Cool coffee shop with ton of space for seating. They have a huge seating space that could probably fit an extra 5 tables easily. They have a signature drink called the ambrosia. It’s like cold brew mixed with milk and flower petals at the top. It was not for me. This drink doesn’t have a strong coffee taste to it< /review>

These local coffee shops are so much better than something like Starbucks.  Great service here with a lot of open space, although the interior space could have more comfortable seating.  I shared the single outside picnic table with another patron, which was great for the perfect weather.  The honey latte with cinnamon was excellent, as was the prosciutto and gruyere croissant (on a weekday).  Unfortunately,  I tried the same order on a Saturday shortly after they opened,  and the croissant was a cold ball of dough,  meat and cheese inside.   It seemed right out of the fridge that day.  Yuck.  The person I brought with me that time had the same thing and agreed completely.  I'll still give 4 stars to cut them a break given my first experience.<//review>

This needs to be redesigned to make more intimate. I've got ideas. But just bring it together more, it's big enough to do a lot of really cool stuff. I see you trying and it's fun to watch this space transform as it grows. I can imagine whoever owns this place already had it figured out. Would love to see an older crowd here, it can totally capture that vibe. I love to go and see how it changes. Really cool concept, I hope we can keep it up.</Review>

<pics>None< /pics><rating>5<//rating><Review>They rotate through different roasters, but it doesn't matter whom they are featuring, Ambrose consistently has the best cup of coffee in Pasadena. Their prices are great too, <$3 for their dialed-in drip. They pay their baristas a fair, no-tipping wage too.

If you're a regular, don't get attached to a specific seat. They reorganize their large open space constantly. (I think it depends on whatever artist they are featuring, but I don't know that for sure.) The music is sometimes a little raucous for the early morning for my taste, but that's true at every coffee shop I frequent.

Overall, Ambrose is Pasadena's best-kept coffee shop secret. I hope the word gets out.< /Review><UserId.>116379308468239799674</UserId.><name>Elijah Davidson<//name><response>{'time': 1563403838058, 'text': 'Thanks for this amazing and detailed review!'}<//response><Time>1559582793421</Time></record></dataset><record>

Really cool setup, this is basically a hollowed out bookstore that they put tables and wifi into. Ideal place to work on a laptop or settle down with a book. Seating is limited so be aware that you may share a table or couch.

There is artwork hung throughout so stop and admire the pieces! Good coffee and friendly staff.

Theologically adjacent to Fuller seminary across the street. This coffee shop has a campus vibe with limited parking but also lots of open space but a moderate amount of seating. The actual POS is in the back of the building.< /text>

My latte was very good and the owner was very polite and welcoming!  I just hated the inside seating.  Very boring, cold vibe.  No music and everyone was whispering.  Couldn't wait to leave.</Text>

We like to think of this setup as our initial prototype.  We hope to have a new location that will embody the community following in a whole new way.  Ambrose is a very small startup that began with very little resources (as is obvious by our space). The business is growing and I’m excited to offer an entirely new environment some time next year.  Follow us on instagram @AmbrosePasadena for more information in the coming months.'}< /resp><time>1572667141247< /time><userid>112592866833597093379<//userid><rate>4</rate></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I'll admit I was a little chary about the charcoal latte hype but I was pleasantly surprised by the Ambrosia latte here. It cost $5 and was a good blend of deep espresso flavor mellowed out by the nuanced highlights of rose and charcoal. The iced version was a little creamier while the hot version was slightly more complex -- I think the warmth allows them to develop on your palate more.

A few other things: service was extremely friendly and despite the cafe having just the one barista, we got our drinks relatively quickly. Alternative milks including Oatly are free, which is a really lovely perk. There was plenty of space to sit inside and out, although the cafe is co-joined up against a larger space.</text>< Pictures>

Very art gallery vibe- sparse, lots of concrete. Then you go to the back and it's a normal coffee shop. Their matcha was ok - I would definitely go back, but it wasn't the best I had that day. *shrug*.</Review>< Name>

<text>I was looking for a coffee shop that would welcome a hipster with a laptop who needed to stay multiple hours to finish some projects - I found that here. Lots of comfortable seating, stable WIFI, an amazing chai latte, gender neutral restrooms, and a neat/out of the way location. I'll be back!</text>< pics>

Seriously.... have you ever heard of Oatmilk? Well they have it and they had me try it. It was so good I had them add it to my latte.  They keep trying to get me to a matcha scene, but that green icing looks like mold. Not gonna do it guys. Dont forget to register your phone number so you can earn points to free drinks or food.

Great service and baristas! Cool outdoor seating area for hanging out. All of the usual Starbucks amenities including indoor seating, food options, public restroom, and free wifi.  Good accessibility (I use crutches all of the  time).  Alas, no drive thru option. We totally need more Starbucks with drive thru.<//review>< rate>

Great place but giving 3 stars because of the loud pop music. Open your eyes Starbucks! 90% of your customers are college students trying to study and  other adults trying to do work from their computers. Your customers are wearing EAR PLUGS to drown out the noise. Turn that shiz down.< /text>

This Starbucks is a hit and miss. It's a hit when it's 120 degrees outside and there is only one customer, it's a miss when it's a beautiful balmy 75 degrees outside and two customers< /review>

<Name>Warren Harrison< /Name><review>This was the first Starbucks in Valencia and they recently moved a few doors down into a much bigger space, and it's a really great location. I just can't live without my Nitro Cold Brew every morning, and this location is great for meeting friends or for business meetings. There's always such a cool vibe that I like bringing my laptop and just sitting and working here every once in a while. This is a very convenient location and the staff is great.</review><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>107723336752033860239</user_id>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>I love this starbucks! Its awesome! the food is really good and the employees are super nice and will talk to you. The only problem is that there are so many people who stay there for like hours on their computers and take up whole tables. Like they'll take up and entire table. Its sometimes really hard to find a table thats empty. Other wise I love this starbucks!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Used to be a nice quiet place when it was original. Now. Nope. They recently tripled the size & now every Laptop Camper is showing up, you cannot drink your coffee anymore b/c the campers have taken over. They are like locusts, as soon as a small Starbucks ( which they can never camp in b/c it’s too small & they need multiple tables with 2laptops printers receptacles for 20 ft extension cords etc) remodels & becomes bigger they send the word out, calling all Laptop campers !Marshall all Laptops & let’s pack this Starbucks out so the regulars who come everyday can never sit in here again. They sit at their multiple tables with their free Venti water a tall coffee for 8 hour shifts, or 10 - 15 come in & take over the long table & round table & have a Laptop union meeting.<//Review>< response>

Nice outdoor seating area. 10 tables outide. 5 tables inside with a community table. Store is clean & organized.

The Service: 2 staffs on duty. Prompt service. If any customers waiting in line, they will greet the customers & let them know they will be right with them. After picking up the drink, they will say "have a nice day" to every customers. EXCELLENT SERVICE!

The Drink: Prepare the drinks efficiently. Keep the good standard & quality.

The Parking: Parking lot (FREE) in a big plaza< /text>

<username>evie g</username><time>1564170951391<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>This is one of my favorite Starbucks ! They have the best management and the staff is just fabulous. They are consistently friendly and the drinks are on point.  They keep everything restocked and it's been my experience that the store is very clean, including their restrooms. I get several different types of cold and hot drinks. My favorite  drinks are the pink drink, coffee fraps, chai lattes, green teas, (both iced and cold) vanilla bean fraps and I also enjoy trying out new drinks. As far as foods, I like the banana bread, coffee cake, double bacon breakfast sandwiches and pumpkin bread (when it's in season). Thank you Starbucks, you are my happy place!</text>< pictures>

Yeah, it's often packed up with folks. But, it's because they go the extra mile so to speak. And, they make a honest effort to remember your name and your usual drinks. Sometimes, it's a madhouse, but you're inclined to expect that stuff in such a comfortable and popular setting... worth the extra time it takes to wait in line!<//text>

Good location and friendly staff. However Baristas forget to mention discounts etc. I had to ask for the $5 gift card offer when buying a bag of holiday whole bean coffee. Also they forget to discount the 10  cents when one uses a personal cup.</text>

<Review>Coffee was great, but listening to the staff use R-rated conversation with little kids in the coffee shop was sad. You're more than welcome to speak how you choose to speak, but not while you represent your company and in the presence of small children.< /Review><rating>2< /rating>< Date>

< Review>
This place is usually busy with a very large population of regulars. One of the better Starbucks in the area as they are consistent with how they make coffee.</Review>

<text>When I got there the place was packed. I don't mind waiting at all, but when I got to the front I realized why. All the workers were chatting and joking and laughing. That's fine of course, but a bit problematic when there's people waiting. When I got to the front the guy working there didn't even talk to me, just paused and stared at me. I told him what I wanted. He picked up the cup to write my order and left the counter to keep joking with his coworkers. Came back just to grab my card which I was holding while waiting. Swiped my card, handed it back and walked away without offering me a receipt or confirming my order. When I looked back, the next person in line wasn't being helped for the same reason of socialization. The guy that made my drink only filled the cup up 3/4 of the way if that and walked away without calling my order. I took it and left. Won't be going back. I feel bad for everyone in line obviously just trying to get in and out.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2871f4b61e28f:0x6fc2646c2709cdc5< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>We've been going here since it opened! Awesome Chinese Food in big portions and fair prices. The staff is here is so friendly, they will have you coming back as a regular. I love when they ask me about my daughter when she isn't with me. The drink menu and donuts are great for your sweet tooth too! I definitely recommend!</text>< pics>

<rating>5</rating><Review>We just moved to Buena Park a few weeks ago and this shop is just a few blocks away from me. I see it everyday on my way to work and my way home, so I finally had enough of bad Chinese food from different places and took a chance on this place. We came in around 8:30, an hour before they close so we didn’t have high expectations but man oh man! This food was good!! It was full of flavor and we knew if we came back when it was freshly made it would be even better. And the price was CHEAP. For two combo A’s and two drinks it was less than $20!!! And because they were closing soon they hooked us up with extra food!! We got free egg rolls, orange chicken on the side, and a few other sides. Definitely coming back!</Review>< Pics>

The Chinese food was pretty tasty. Ordered the 2 entree combo, and a small side order of beef and broccoli. The total was around $11. Grand Opening special gives you a free small drink and egg roll with any food purchase. Donut selection looked good too.<//Review>

So yummy.  Chinese food in same place.  I love their specialty donuts, and their breakfast croissants are amazing.  Breakfast at 5 am and lunch later all in one corner.  Not bad.  So glad they opened.</text>

<review>OMG, they just opened recently and I went I  for 1 glazed donut and ended up buying coffee, donut holes, mini frosted donuts and the most unbelievably good croissant sandwhich with bacon egg and cheese...it was absolutely perfect...I had no idea...I will be returning to try their other goodies and the chinese food.  Boston donuts just sold me...and the nicest little lady was working...love this for early morning breakfast needs.  For the price and flavor I wont need fast food places now....thanks for opening up!!!!<//review>< Pics>

The donuts are so good. Not too fond of the brownies. Kinda dry and cake like. But the donuts are really good. And the workers are patient and friendly! We havent tried the chinese food yet but look forward to it.< /Review>

Nice to have this store near my Son's Archery school. We love the original Boston Donuts near our place in Imperial Hwy. Glad to know they are the same owners. More variety,  best donuts, Chinese fast food and Boba Drinks. They have all what I want in one store.< /review>

Horrible and bland Chinese food not to mention cold.
How can the food smell so good yet taste so bad?
But the doughnuts are a pretty good item would only return to get them not the Chinese food
And to the workers pls smile stop looking like your having a bad day.< /Text>

I wouldn't take my car anywhere else! I've been taking my cars here for almost 20 years. Tony (the owner)is the best! He stands behind his shops work! A real stand up guy. His customer service is top notch.<//review>

<text>Marlin & Tony's auto is the only place I will take my vehicle. Their customer service is amazing they fixed all of my vehicles ailments and did faster and cheaper than I could have imagined...

<Review>Great service. A friendly place to take your car too. I have taken my car here three times for different problems. I didn't have all the money at  time, to get all the issues with my car fixed in one visit. They keep record of what was recommended so on your next visit they know what needs to be done. They break down the price for you. They always ask what you wa t done before they do anything to your car. They didn't try to pressure me into getting any repairs done that I didn't want. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Do call and ask questions yourself, just to get a feel of what they can offer you.< /Review>< user_id>

<Name>Jasen Hudson</Name><time>1555475188665<//time><rate>5</rate><Review>I had an issue where a car that I got at a great deal seemed to be priced as such due to what we would find out was a bad transmission. Tony and the staff at the shop called with the news, of course no one would be happy to hear. But even the way it was delivered, made me feel "ok" hearing it. The variety of replacement part options provided by Tony showcased the shop's honesty and willingness to make the horrible situation much better. Fortunately for me, I was able to work something out with the dealership to have the car returned. Even with this process, Tony and the staff were incredible facilitating this process which was longer than expected. I will bring any and all of my cars here for service, and recommend their business to anyone in need of any vehicle services, diagnostics to major repairs. This is your shop!< /Review>< Pictures>

Excellent and honest work. I took my truck into this shop for an electrical issue after I got it back from another shop that said they couldn’t figure it out. It sat at that other shop for a few weeks. My truck hasn’t run right in over a year These guys diagnosed and fixed it in less than 2 hours...< /Review>

< Review>
At first, the customer service was good & the auto service price was affordable so I continue going there and I started to realize that the service gets worse and worse. But despite the customer service I had decided to call and see if tony was able to fix my driveline shaft for me ( the auto service was affordable & I needed my car for work ASAP)  Eventhough, he knew that that's something they don't specialize in... He lied to me to get me to go in. And I didn't know that until afterwards that only a driveline specialists or an special auto transmission place can only fix it. So moral to the story... He got me to go in saying they can fix it to tell me at the end they can't fix it and he doesn't know what the part is called and charged me $50 dollars for the expection when I already told him I know what's wrong with the car. But  even if he did know the name to the part he wouldn't be able to fix it anyways. So guys, be careful when you guys go to him.< /Review>

Tony was extremely helpful when my passenger side mirror broke. He made phone calls and got back to me in 30 mins. Now I would only go to his shop whenever my car needs service.< /Text>

Tony and his team have always provided great service. Best of you call ahead of time to schedule an appointment. Very trust worthy, very transparent, will get down to the problem, won't tell you to get things you don't need, and even gives you options on equipment at times to accommodate your goals and budget. If you want an honest mechanic this is the place.<//Review>

Marlin & Tony's auto is the only place I will take my vehicle. Their customer service is amazing they fixed all of my vehicles ailments and did faster and cheaper than I could have imagined... Tony will go over and above to make sure your vehicle will run safe and sound on the road.< /text>

Great service. A friendly place to take your car too. I have taken my car here three times for different problems. I didn't have all the money at  time, to get all the issues with my car fixed in one visit. They keep record of what was recommended so on your next visit they know what needs to be done. They break down the price for you. They always ask what you wa t done before they do anything to your car. They didn't try to pressure me into getting any repairs done that I didn't want. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Do call and ask questions yourself, just to get a feel of what they can offer you.</text>

I had an issue where a car that I got at a great deal seemed to be priced as such due to what we would find out was a bad transmission. Tony and the staff at the shop called with the news, of course no one would be happy to hear. But even the way it was delivered, made me feel "ok" hearing it. The variety of replacement part options provided by Tony showcased the shop's honesty and willingness to make the horrible situation much better. Fortunately for me, I was able to work something out with the dealership to have the car returned. Even with this process, Tony and the staff were incredible facilitating this process which was longer than expected. I will bring any and all of my cars here for service, and recommend their business to anyone in need of any vehicle services, diagnostics to major repairs. This is your shop!</text>

Excellent and honest work. I took my truck into this shop for an electrical issue after I got it back from another shop that said they couldn’t figure it out. It sat at that other shop for a few weeks. My truck hasn’t run right in over a year These guys diagnosed and fixed it in less than 2 hours...</Text>

Tony is really helpful.  If you are able to give him a good enough description of what is going on, he can diagnose the issue and order the part(s) needed for repairs so you have less wait time.  He operates a very clean shop and is very friendly.< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>At first, the customer service was good & the auto service price was affordable so I continue going there and I started to realize that the service gets worse and worse. But despite the customer service I had decided to call and see if tony was able to fix my driveline shaft for me ( the auto service was affordable & I needed my car for work ASAP)  Eventhough, he knew that that's something they don't specialize in... He lied to me to get me to go in. And I didn't know that until afterwards that only a driveline specialists or an special auto transmission place can only fix it. So moral to the story... He got me to go in saying they can fix it to tell me at the end they can't fix it and he doesn't know what the part is called and charged me $50 dollars for the expection when I already told him I know what's wrong with the car. But  even if he did know the name to the part he wouldn't be able to fix it anyways. So guys, be careful when you guys go to him.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80945e80a6d2c525:0xdfe3deebfab56137</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Tony was extremely helpful when my passenger side mirror broke. He made phone calls and got back to me in 30 mins. Now I would only go to his shop whenever my car needs service.</review>

< Review>
Just got my brows done on Thursday, and I’ve received nothing but compliments. My brows look beautiful! No pics because they’re still fresh, but the shape is exactly what I wanted. She kept them as natural as possible, which I prefer. There was some pain with the procedure, but that’s to be expected, and it was very tolerable. I’ve told everyone I know about what a good experience I had and highly recommend getting your brows done here. You won’t regret it!< /Review>

There wasn’t really a clinic that did permanent makeup near me so I decided to give Beverly hills a try. Lavish Permanent Makeup truly left my eyebrows looking elegant yet fierce. With the pigmentation on my eyebrows, I can now go out and socialize with confidence that I look good. Thanks!</Review>

I was not disappointed at all with my overall experience at Lavish Shadow. The facility is in a suite within a building on Wilshire boulevard. Your best bet for parking will be the the public parking right behind the building on Linden St. that charges a flat rate of $5 (not sure if this changes daily but I was there on a Saturday morning) . Considering the time needed for any of the procedures offered at Lavish Shadow this is the closest and best option for parking. I would recommend Lavish Shadow to anybody and everybody that is looking for microblading or any other cosmetic treatment that they have to offer! It is a beautiful and clean environment, and my artist was great with informing me about the procedure and after care. I couldn’t be happier with the work she did on my brows, she fulfilled my every need and desire for giving me the brows of my dreams. My eyebrows are sparse and thin, I was looking to add shape and fill in the empty spots I had while making it look all natural, and she did just that.Thank you so much Lavish Shadow! Can’t wait to come in for my touch up in a couple weeks!<//Text>

My eyebrows have always been thin so I decided to get the hair stroke procedure at Beverly Hills since I did have most of my natural eyebrow. I wanted it to extend a lot farther than it really was. Lavish really did a great job. It looks really natural and no one has noticed that its fake yet. I managed to tell my family but this goes to show how professional and detailed Lavish’s services are. Thank You!< /review>

<review>Beautiful work and environment!
Ladan was very sweet and made me comfortable when I arrived. During the procedure, she checked up on me to make sure I was comfortable and happy with my eyebrows. I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted done with my eyebrows, I just knew that i wanted them to look natural. They look much better than I expected. I'm happy I went to Lavish Shadow and would recommend it to anyone looking for microblading services.<//review>< pictures>

I said it on Yelp and I'll say it again!!
I stopped by Ladan's studio suite to see what all the fuss is about! I was instantly in love with the place. You can tell how much effort went into the design. I should have brought my husband in, he's a designer!!
Anyway, I didn't know anything about microblading but Ladan walked me through the whole process and somehow managed to answer all my questions (I had a lot). I was totally sold and went through with the procedure which was so darn easy. My grandchildren say I look beautiful now.<//Review>

<Text>Bnladan made my eyebrows uneven and one super darker than the other! Color turned to a wierd redish purple in 2 days. Apparently she did not understand what color I was asking for as she barely understands and speaks English! I should have trusted my gut when I first arrived at the place and saw "cheesy-all fake head to toe" with $1 replica jewellry, shoes and clothing on... . When I clearly saw her creepy face I litteraly freaked out cos every surgery on face, nose, lips, cheeks, eyebrows, butt and breasts etc have gone wrong I should have known she can't possibly give me a normal brows... All my fault...< /Text>< Name>

<Text>Beautiful environment and gorgeous work! Ladan reached my eyebrow goals! I was so nervous to get this done, but I am so happy that I did! My eyebrows were very thin and had no shape, now my eyebrows look great and it’s only the first day! Thanks Ladan! She is wonderful at what she does and makes sure to check on you during the procedure to ensure you are okay! Would definitely recommend her to others!< /Text></record>

< Review>
I'm really upset. It's been two weeks since getting microbladed and the brow strokes are big, blurry, and gray-hued not matching my natural hair color. Like, my self-esteem and confidence from this is negatively affected... Also, many professionals say a dry-heal should be done, meaning no creams or product placed on the brows during healing. . . Ladan provides this vaseline-type product and says to apply it for 7 days.<//Review>

<review>I recently went to Lavish Shadow for eyebrow microblading. Ladan did an amazing job! She took her time and my brows look sooo good. She was very nice and made my experience wonderful. They have really great pricing and they are very professional. I will definitely come back and will tell my friends and family to come here for their permanent makeup needs.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

<Review>I'd been wanting and researching microblading for some time and fnally decided I was going for it. The process was fast, painless and zero swelling. I went straight to Dr appointment from the studio and i got my first compliment, when  nurse went  to take my blood pressure and she said wow! I just noticed your eyebrows they look beautiful.  I walked out of there feeling pretty good.  Thank you Ladan, you are the best..<//Review>< Date>

I had the best experience at Lavish Shadow. Ladan is very experienced and it shows in her work.  My eyebrows were very thin and after the microblading sessions my eyebrows looked better than ever before. I love my eyebrows and they look so natural too. Thank you Ladan.</text>

I am so happy with Ladan's microblading. My eyebrows are flawless. Like most, I freaked out the 2nd day after procedure thinking they were too dark when in fact they just needed to heal. I grew up with very very light eyebrows and always wanted the perfect brows and Ladan gave me what ive always wanted! They came out EXACTLY how I wanted them to be. So professional, personable, I'm going back to do permanent eyeliner with her next. She has great taste in shape and am in awe with her work! Thank you so much!!!< /text>

She was very informative which helped me feel like I could trust her with my eyebrows. They came out great and are now even better after the touch up. I have already recommended Ladan to those who compliment my eyebrows. The price is great and she is also willing to work with your schedule which makes me like her so much more!

<Rating>5<//Rating><pictures>None</pictures><review>My first impression of this place is that it's CLEAN (very important) organized and Ladan (the owner) is very personable, friendly and professional. She's also attentive and listen to what I want. I was nervous at first, but after meeting her and talking to her, she really made me feel at ease. She's also put on some really nice musics, some are slow and soothing, while some are pretty upbeat and uplifting. :)

I really liked how my brows looked afterwards. Recently went back in for a touch-up as a post-microblading procedure. I'm so glad to learn that there's absolutely NO downtime at all. No redness/swelling at all. Probably because I take very good care of my brows afterwards. Applied the Vitamins ointment provided by Ladan, and I made sure to keep them dry for the first 24HRs. I took a bath, vs my usual showers.

Recently went back in for a quick touch-up. My brows looked really good now. I love how shapely and defined they are. They really matched my soft features and face. I've also been getting a lot of compliments from strangers and co-workers alike on how good my brows look, whom can't tell that I've had microblading done, until I told them...;) Very happy with my new eye brows and Ladan's professionalism.< /review></record>

I ordered the unagi, salad, and sushi roll. They didn't bring my salad and had to ask the waitress many times before telling me they already brought it, they gave it to the wrong table it turned out and when I asked for another salad charged me twice. When I paid in cash with large bills I was supposed to get $12 back in change but they never brought it back. I asked for my change but they said they already shut down the cash register for the night and would not open it. Then asked they were closing and kicked me out. I hope they enjoy the $12 tip, not coming back again.< /Text>

<Review>The food was great! Good variety of Japanese with a little bit of Korean. Sushi doesn't look appealing on the pictures, but the result is great

Although, the service was not that great, we had to ask 3 times for forks and Sriracha sauce, 4 times for the box to go

Food is great, Service is Ok<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXvySGc75O-gQ9eVngmOnfqefIiXBtAiyyZNwl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzmajasEYE9YiqKrkf6DLgugayskgmrjDmg4ks=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnSsGDU9XdcKr_EjTreS9qKLFwctPUUzGuJxC2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><rating>4<//rating><Date>1548452141818<//Date>< gmap_id>

Kinda pricey for a homey locale. Convenient location to Hyatt Regency and friendly staff though. Fast service.<//Review>

They did not spend their money on creating a fine dining atmosphere,  but the sushi was fantastic and really nice portions for the money.  Atmosphere is not terrible.. just very casual and after work type vibe.  Food was terrific and service was fine.<//Text>

<review>I love sushi - a mixture of Japanese and Korean food. A mixture of hit and miss.

The restaurant has an ambience of typical American diner more than Asian Restaurant. Spacious, clean and relax ambient.

Service is attentive, fast and courteous

Complimentary Miso soup is promptly served as soon as we sat down. Warm a bit watered down, bland.
Had Golden California roll, crunchy on the outside just a bit tad thick on rice with filling of mayo-dressed crab sticks with bits of avocado-cucumber; am not sure i tasted mango in it.

The shrimp tempura is crispy but dry that it becomes too crumbly to touch. Shrimp is too small to be be noticeably tasty. Tempura sauce is also watered down-bland.

The only saving grace is the hot-stoned beef bibimbap. Served sizzling hot that made rice crispy at the bottom, the way I liked my hot bibimbap. Generous serving of fresh-crisp vegetables and beef strips that are tender and tastily marinated. The only letdown was the topped egg that is already fried very well done. But it's one good bibimbap, one of my comfort food.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAC4xdHQVjJkoqOHyDb22hVvah8PMXq3nWW47H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2izl8H8t_haQwlsvuWxlkWd8PMM9_4oAR2ngl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Considering this place is called I Love Sushi, it actually had a fair amount of Korean food as well. We came here right when it opened for an early lunch. Service was decent, but maybe because it didn’t get busy until later. We got a few orders and they soon came back with some side dishes which were pretty good. We got the jimbo sushi roll which was okay. Nothing really stood out. We also got the bulgolgi which I liked and the bibimbap was good too. I think the bulgogi was my favorite though as it was super tender and had a good amount of sweetness.

Overall, come here if you can’t decide between Korean or Japanese. I liked the Korean food better than the sushi roll, but the food overall was decent.<//Text>

Came here for lunch for the first time with my co-worker. Parking lot closest to the restaurant was starting to fill up. When we came in, we were acknowledged with a friendly unison of "Hajimemashite" from the staff and servers. We were seated immediately, looked through the menu, & were served free appetizers (edamame, two sushi slices and cucumber). The sushi slices were actually surprising to be honest because I have never dined at a Japanese restaurant that included sushi samples as the appetizers.

My co-worker ordered a bento box & I ordered a Chicken Dupbap. My co-worker didn't finish her bento, but she commented on its deliciousness. The Chicken Dupbap had this grilled flavor to it as well as chili tomato sauce, but it wasn't spicy & lacked salt. It was filling overall.

The atmosphere was calm & the interior was kind of strange. Korean, Japanese, & American? It's great that it's catered to different cultures. However, it's quite interesting how the menu had Korean & Japanese food; yet the atmosphere was modern American. Service was pretty quick, but that's only because we dined shortly after the restaurant opened at 11:30 AM. Servers were quick on their feet, attentive, & direct. I didn't get to taste their sushi, but next time I will. The Korean dishes were tasty, despite lack of salt. I will definitely return a second time &  recommend this place to my friends.</Text>

<Text>'I LOVE SUSHI'  is a cute little place we stumbled upon before catching the nighttime fireworks display on Fourth of July night. We ended up in Burlingame and were quite content with this Resto.. Korean style dishes creatively presented and tasted wonderful! We shared the Special Galbi Beef with all little side dishes included. Also ordered the Shrimp Tempura. Which was crunchy and delicious.  Not crowded and staff was super helpful. We will definitely return.. Highly recommend!< /Text>< Pics>

Great, and I mean GREAT sushi and a super staff. Talked to the owner/manger and she was super great. Honestly, this place rocks. Well priced, super quality sushi...what's not to love? Oh, and it has a great view over the bay.

“We love sushi” is a way overpriced (a “Kendell Jackson” savignon win bottle for $30!!)  , very slow and confused Korean/pseudo-Sushi restaurant that piggy backs off Hyatt hotel nearby. The simple order “One for here, one to go” is misunderstood - only “to go” item is prepared. No water offered. No hot tea refill offered. A request to bring an extra fork for a child struggling with chopsticks is ignored.  The wait time…. oh yeah… is way longer than in restaurants of a similar type. A scent of an old building. 20 minutes prior to the afternoon break (between lunch and dinner)  all waiters and chefs start eating their own lunch.. .And finally -  the finally, the words “sorry for the…” should NOT be in the restaurant vocabulary: any normal restaurant in case of confusion, delay or misunderstanding always offers something complimentary. Not this place.</Review>

<Review>Great place for a quick bite to eat on lunch break. I enjoy this restaurant for their quick and attentive service, and they offer a variety of food from Japanese to Korean BBQ. I have tried a couple dishes, including BBQ and sushi, and the meals are always tasty! Reasonable pricing for decent and hearty meals.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Really disappointing since the last time I was here. Was here for a solo Saturday lunch. Bulgogi beef came with only a few side dishes. Last time I was here edimame and a sushi roll were included, along with generous side dishes and sauces.

Waiter took my order and then I never saw him again until delivering the bill. No refilling the water, asking how the food was, etc. Elderly lady delivered the food and when asked about dipping sauces had no idea what I was talking about. She said she’d bring some hot sauce back but never returned.

Check out another place, this isn’t as good as it used to be. Food and service has gone down enough to make this place a hard PASS.</text>< pics>

Food is mediocre. Got the bibimbap and pork bulgogi. Korean side dishes they come with aren't that great either. Service was pretty bad. Got our food before our waters. Had to ask them twice for water.<//Review>

Good, but not great, food. Bulgogee was a large portion with sides, but not as tasty as I've had in other Korean restaurants. Came at lunchtime two days, second time they said there was no lunch menu, but another table near us got one and we did the first time too.< /Review>

Went there with a group of 20, they were really good about it and even split the bill into 5 different tables which made paying easier. The sushi (I had the lemon drop) was really good and I tried many of my friends food and it was all very good.< /text>

Very, very small portion for the price. Taste was average at best. The wait is probably the a 1 star, but the servers are great.</text>

<Text>Prices look high at first but the portions are generous. The rolls you get with the bento boxes are big enough they have to come on a separate plate. Special rolls in the $15 range are also giant compared to what you normally find.

Fish was fresh, service was good, and two people who can normally eat a ridiculous amount of sushi left stuffed for under $60.</Text>< Name>

<text>Came in for lunch today. Stood behind the sign that said "Please wait to be seated" along with another group of 3 people in front of us. Stood there for about 15 minutes while about a dozen tables were empty and the 4 employees didn't even address the growing line at the door. It wasn't particularly busy. Just bad customer service. I considered that a sign of things to come with the service so my wife and I just left. When we left, there were now about 6 orbe7 parties waiting for a table. Do yourself a favor and go another minute down the street to Mr. Teriyaki.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Food was fine. Ordered one of the vegetarian rolls and it had unagi all over it. I had to take apart half of the outside of each roll, which was really upsetting. Unagi is not vegetarian, and I hope they will stop putting it on vegetarian rolls.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1510075099938, 'text': "Marcus, I'm sorry about that.

< Review>
Got the dinner bento box. A lot of food for the price. Although the chicken in the chicken teriyaki was not hot and very fatty and grisly. Not very good. Sushi was OK. I’ll go back and give it another shot but wasn’t too impressed with my first visit.< /Review>

<review>I'm only reviewing the Korean food as we did not have sushi.  Was not expecting much but very pleasantly surprised.  Very solid Korean food.  Soon dubu had flavor. Right amount of spice.  The bulgogi and galbi were also solid players.   I think they should switch themselves to a korean bbq place.  The area could use a good one.< /review>< date>

<text>Gave them the extra star because that were open on a normal off day for a convention. Unhelpful wait staff; unclear menu limitations, extremely long wait, one person at my 8 top finished eating before three women even got their food, a few incorrectly taken or misplaced orders.

Service was terrible. Had to have someone check my order because almost everyone at my table had already eaten by the time I got my roll and the waiter actually said he was annoyed because of the convention.</review>

Chummy shochu and cloud draft beer that is only in the United States, I ate a beer beer cheaper than anywhere else, but .....

The food is nice and friendly

제 기준 엘카미노 한식당들보다 양도 많고 싸요. 그리고  훨씬 맛있었어요

미국에만 나온다는 Chummy소주랑 클라우드 생맥주 시켜먹었는데 다른 데보다 맥주 가격도 싸서 조금 과음을 했지만 .....

맛도 있고 괜찮았어요 저는 많이먹는 편인데 비빔밥 더블사이즈가 진짜로 2공기 넣은줄 알았네요. 반찬 더 주신다는데 더 들러갈 배가 없어요... 추천합니다!</Review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) I love sushi and I thought it was a sushi restaurant, but as long as it is run by Koreans, it seems to be a Japanese restaurant.
Soft tofu was really good. The side dishes were all delicious and refilled !! Salmon skin rolls were also delicious.

(Original)
I love sushi 라고 크게적혀있어서 초밥집인줄알았는데 한국인이 운영하는 한,일식 전문점인듯하다.
순두부가 진짜 맛있었다. 반찬도 다 맛있었고 리필도되었다!! 같이시킨 salmon skin roll 도 맛있었다.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport - recommended approaches. The yukyuk bulgogi is especially delicious ~ The other menus are delicious and the staff are so friendly.
However, the smell of disinfectant in the restaurant makes me feel uncomfortable so I think it's good to improve this point ~

(Original)
하야트리젠시 호텔 샌프란시스코 공항과 가까워 좋습니다~. 제육불고기가 특히 맛있어요~ 다른메뉴도 맛있게 먹고 직원분들도 친절해서 여기 호텔에 숙박 할 때마다 한번씩은 방문하는 곳입니다.
단, 식당 내에 나는 소독약냄새 같은 것이 기분이 불쾌하게 만들어서 이 점만 개선되면 좋을것 같아요~<//Text>< rating>

<review>I would say this is an excellent restaurant on multiple levels. Great atmosphere, wonderful service, the quality of the main dishes especially was excellent. I would highly recommend trying it out in the Carmel area. Rich with history I can see why the restaurant has been around for so long. I hope to be back soon. The pasta was especially excellent and the basque cheesecake for dessert would definitely be my choice again.</review></record>

If you haven't been before, know that the ambiance of the rustic storybook cottage is memorable, romantic and unique. When ordering, know that you can't go wrong: the meat and produce  is fresh and top quality.... but the gnocchi is an absolute must have! Matt manages the beverages and has an unbelievable collection of wines in his cellar--so if you're a wine expert you are sure to be impressed. The staff go over and above to provide great experiences for their guests and you will be talking about your visit for weeks to come. I'm happy to have come across this place back in 2005 and continue to visit every time I am in Carmel.</Review>< Pictures>

She says the Celery Root was amazing, so so good..
He says the steak was second to none.. flavor and doneness was perfect...
We had the cheesecake desert and it was the perfect topper...
We had a great bottle of 2016 sparking wine..

Back story is, I was up here i. 2017 for the Sea Otter Classic MTB festival and saw this as it was across from my hotel.. just the look and story made me want to come back and finally eat here.. well.let me say.. it was most certainly worth the wait..

Such a wonderful place, in Carmel by the sea, the favorite spot of our friend Wayne Osborne. The food is beautiful, amazing taste, and array of options. Very artsy and creative plates with extra care on the details. Everything that I ever eat there has always been delicious. Service is magnificent. They have a nice selection of wines as well. Highly recommended <3</review>

The service is impeccable, the food is amazing and the ambience is very cozy, homey and comforting. The champignon is out of the world and so is the gnocchi.

My boyfriend and I have eaten here several times and I have always enjoyed our experience. Last night, my boyfriend ate a half dozen oysters and become VIOLENTLY ill. He was vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time all night. When I called the restaurant today to let them know about his experience after spending over $300 on dinner, all they had to say was “I’m so sorry that happened” and delightfully canceled our reservation for next Friday per my request. I’m shocked by the questionable service. You should NOT order raw oysters here. It is possible that these oysters are contaminated with vibrio bacteria which can cause illness and should be reported to the department of health. Beware!</text>

<Review>Romantic Italian/French restaurant in Carmel. Cozy atmosphere. The restaurant is separated into several small rooms, as it was converted from an original residential house. All dishes were delicious and flavourful. Extensive wine list. Service was very friendly and fast.</Review>< rating>

<text>Quaint place with outdoor seating right in Carmel. Food and service we're good, but not in line with the price, even for Carmel.
A vegetable ravioli runs about $40 incl. Tax and tip - it's hard to make a veggie pasta that good to justify the price. For my taste it was also too soupy.
4 stars for food and service, one star down for price.< /text>< pictures>

Absolutely outstanding!! Very charming atmosphere excellent service, the food was just incredible, we ordered two salads two entrées and a dessert to split.... The salmon and the beef were incredible, and even the salads were so so well executed!! Highly recommend ordering the asparagus salad just outstanding. For dessert we had the lemon meringue pie OMG!!!! Incredible!!
I suggest calling in advance to make a reservation<//Text>

I love the tapenade they serve with fresh bread, and the fettuccine they serve with seafood is my standard order. The sauce is so good, the seafood is so fresh, and there isn't too much pasta. And that's good because then you have room for dessert - tonight we chose the nougatini and three of us shared one and ended up getting another. It is a very charming ambiance, and the serving of many dishes in saucepans makes you feel like the kitchen is coming straight to your table. Be sure to make reservations ahead of time and try to book the patio!<//review>< Pictures>

Once you pay attention to the details, you'll notice the subtle touches that give the place a distinct character. The food and service was pretty equally matched. Although a limited menu over lunch, the food was very flavorful and we thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it, especially the artisanal cheese and champignons (mushrooms). To top if off, they have extensive collection of wines. We tried their mimosas and sparkling rose which were great. And last but not the least, the desserts were really good. Strongly recommend the creme brulee and chocolate nougatine.< /Text>< Rating>

Fettutini was wonderful.  Pasta was fresh, not dried.  Came with lobster.  I would ask to substitute shrimp.  Chocolate mousse was intense flavor, a must dessert.< /text>

Great service, great food (they have housemade ice cream!). I visit Carmel and Monterey multiple times every year, and this restaurant is the best one I've eaten at.
It also has vast selections of wine.< /review>

< review>
Our favorite restaurant in Carmel, it always pleases us with exquisite service, ambiance and cuisine. Very romantic, tucked in close to center of Carmel. The perfect place for a special occasion like anniversary or birthday. We live on the East Coast so our visits are infrequent, but Casanova is always the high spot of our visit.  We were there on June 8th, 2018 on an anniversary trip. A delightful experience in every respect, as it has been on our numerous visits to Carmel.< /review>

My only reason for not giving 5 stars would be our waiter. He rushed us through our meal, hurrying our orders and seemed frustrated. If an 8:30 reservation at a restaurant of this quality is too late, please tell me.</Review>< pictures>

<user_name>Stanley G< /user_name><Review>After going to Casanova for 30+ years which never disappointed until tonight.  Spouse and Daughter had "unremarkable" Salmon,  I had Veal loin which was "meh" at best.   From a previously satisfied customer, I sadly say it time for us to surrender and try one of the many new restaurants that want to win new loyal customers.

The slimmed down menu may be due to COVID and I warn others to view it ahead  as I bet it will help you to seek another place to dine in Carmel.</Review><Date>1596082050687</Date><Rating>2< /Rating>< pics>

<Date>1571549628081</Date><text>This cosy nice frenchstyle restaurant has been around quiet some while.
That means a high standard in the dishes and friendly well informed staff.
While we have to wait for a free table we met the owner and we had a nice conversation with him. He also showed us around and we had a view in the amazing wine cellar.
I recommend this place when your passing through Carmel.<//text><username>Martijn Kamp<//username><Gmap_id>0x808de66b30194231:0x11c905bf5f43036a<//Gmap_id></record>

I have been going to Casanova's for years, and LOVED the gnocchi.  recently they changed the way they make it.  They said the same recipe, but now they pipe it out.  NOT THE SAME - please change it back.
Otherwise, from the steaks to the fish stew, everything including the service is great.</Text>

The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Pretty much everything we tried there was perfect the only thing we were not in love with was the strawberry sherbet but everything else was great. Definitely recommend and make sure to make a reservation< /Review>

This is a restaurant I've visited for almost 25 years, admitting a few years between meals. We've had some good meals over the years, but this last visit didn't meet my expectations. First of all, prices have gotten absurd. $52 for a dish of seafood pasta is ridiculous. It was pretty tasty, but the portions are miniscule, almost to the point of feeling like I needed to guard my plate from "tasters" at my table. My kids wolfed down their adult meals and were browsing for more. The wait staff seemed like they had recently graduated from bus boy status, so the meal flow was awkward. My dish I felt was the best of the pastas, and it fell off quickly after that. Where did Cassandra's go that I loved years ago?<//Text>

I really wish I could give 5 stars but unfortunately our service left little to be desired. The atmosphere was great, the food was delicious, but our waiter would disappear and leave us waiting time and time again. It was busy in the restaurant but not that busy to where he would be overworked and they did not look to be understaffed. We basically felt forgotten about at our table and, I’m assuming, the front floor manager was the one who ended up taking and providing us with our drinks. We had intended to get dessert but after he dropped off the menu it was literally 25 minutes before he showed up again and by that point we wanted to just get our check and go and find dessert elsewhere.</review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>We have loved Casanova for years, but like other reviewers were so disappointed with our recent experience.  We made reservations for a birthday weeks before and were forced to sit outside on a cold night.  When we asked about getting a table inside, the hostess was rude and told us we had no other option but to sit outside.  The crab pasta was chewy and the artichoke panzanella was so salty it was inedible.  The worst part of our experience though was the service which made the meal very uncomfortable.  Our server seemed angry or harried and was aggressive in her interaction with the table.  When we thanked her for bringing food or water, we were met with stony silence.  At the end of the meal, she tossed the dessert menus on the middle of the table and no acknowledgement was made of the birthday we were celebrating.  Incredibly disappointing from a restaurant we’ve loved over the years.  We won’t be back.< /text>< Pics>

Service was weirdly haughty and annoying.  Food was meh (if you're a foodie.)  Price was... ouch!   Maybe it's good if you just want to enjoy the lovely old building.  Went once for dessert, once for dinner; doubt we'll try it again.<//text>

Phenomenal wine list. It may be a bit too heavy on CA reds, for having an Italian food focus, but that's what sells.<//Review>

Casanova was a good place to sit and enjoy the time at, but I personally did not like the food, because it was to salty and the food took a long time to get to the table. But it is a nice place to sit and relax at.<//text>

<Text>If you love Italian cuisine, this is the place. My husband and I had lunch on the outdoor patio so we could have our dog sit with us. The atmosphere was quaint and just divine. The menu has something for everyone. If you’re not in the mood for pasta dishes, they have  fish,beef, pork chicken, salads. We had an marinated olives appetizer, Cannelloni, Catch of the Day, and save room for the Dolce di cioccolata dessert. Of course, a full bar is available. The locals warned me it was a little expensive, but the ambiance and being able to take your dog made it well worth going. Fabulous  dining experience .<//Text>< Gmap_id>

This hurts me to say that Casanova is no longer the quality we have loved for years. We made reservations months ago looking forward to having s wonderful meal for New Years. We had five different dishes that were all salty to the taste. It is no longer worth the wait or the price. So long old friend!</text>

Incredible service, OUTSTANDING food, and relaxing and intriguing atmosphere. I came here with my husband on our honeymoon and it was the perfect end to our first night as husband and wife. From oysters as out appetizer, to bison for our main course, to sorbet for dessert, the food was out of this world!< /text>

<Text>Not dog friendly, as they claimed to be.
Relegated to far corner of patio instead of the indoor table we had reserved.
Menu completely different than what we had looked at online.
Choice on existing menu was unavailable.
Food so slow to arrive at our table that they turned off the heater and music mid-meal. They were closing the restaurant on us.
They seemed more interested in creating a tableau depicting a fine dining experience than catering to a discerning palate.
Disappointed.
We had chosen this place based on recommendations of it being dog friendly and the menu we viewed online. We ended up leaving the dogs in the car, being seated outside and having to settle on food we would not have chosen.  It was too late to go elsewhere. And feeling like they were just tolerating our being there because they wanted to close.< /Text>< rate>

The food is good and honest. The hospitality is gratifying.  They want you to have a good time. The Wine cellar is massive. It is another pet-friendly venue. It is also far enough from Ocean Avenue as to ocassionaly have some on-street parking. The menu is not particularly extensive. They -  like many restaurants in Carmel - seem to concentrate on doing a few things well and some excellently (Catch of the Day).</text>

Must haves: Spinach gnocchi Au gratin and seafood fettuccine.  Thinking about those two dishes now makes my mouth water. The gnocchi is fluffy and goes perfectly with the melted cheese and cream sauce. Even though it was piping hot, I couldn't help but keep eating it and willing to burn my tongue a bit. As for the seafood fettuccine - I'm a big fan (and very picky) of lobster pastas with some sort of white sauce. I wish this one had a bit more lobster and less mussels so the seafood taste could infuse into the sauce more. However, this was still impeccable. I loved the not too creamy sauce that coated the fettuccine perfectly.

The desserts were good but nothing to die for.

Only downside to this restaurant was the price. The seafood fettuccine was $33 and you only get half a lobster, 2 shrimps and some clams and mussels.

I'd still go back for the gnocchi though!</text>

<Review>Off night?
Interesting location. Menu looked very good. Service and food was below average.

We were a party of seven ordering five different entrees. The two cannelloni served at a nice temperature. The other five entrees we're cold or just barely warm.
Desserts were good.

We had to ask for refills on all of our drinks.

I am not sure if they were short staffed that night but it was definitely a below average meal and service.

Based on how many people dining on a Wednesday night and how long they have been serving diners my assumption it was just an off night for them.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Wanted to love it. Was there my wedding night. The food was good (but didn't live up to the hype), service was just ok (and a full glass of water was accidentally spilled on my lap by our server, ruining my brand new suede sandals), the wine list was impressive but the mark up on them was much, much higher than I thought acceptable.</review>< userid>

In the past I've given a much better rating to this restaurant. Something has changed. No more artisanal bread to savor some wine with. The menu has been pared back. Fewer patrons. The wine bar area had almost no wine bottles. Our steak had just a few vegetables and no potatoes, we asked to order some on the side, but none we're available. Huh? Friendly service. They still have their signature gnocchi and desserts. Hope they get back into the game.< /Text>

Beautiful restaurant with a cozy setting and outdoor patio. The croque madame I ordered wasn't bad, a bit too rich, and with the fries a bit too large a portion. This is a matter of preference for me, though, since French restaurants should typically run smaller portions if they want to be authentic. The fresh bread and olive tapenade was delicious, however. The thing that annoyed me the most is that their business description on Google reads "... with an outdoor patio once frequented by Van Gogh". This is of course very incorrect, and comes from the fact that they purchased a dining table, once used by Van Gogh, as a museum piece.<//review>

<review>What a disappointment!

Immediately sat down and got lectured about not bringing a bottle of wine on the wine list by rude staff.  I have no issue about not allowing outside wine, but don’t charge me $35 while opening my wine with an attitude.

The +$250 experience was tarnished from there.  Never coming back.  Too many good restaurants in the area that welcome you.<//review></record>

It's true! This place is on the pricey side but the service is excellent and the food very good. It's not such a great place for vegetarian like myself but what they had was very good. Superb wine list! Sadly our attendant did not know much about the history of the buildings and the area. I expect a restaurant if this level to have well-informed staff. Nevertheless I would recommend this place.< /text>

The moment we entered and tried to get our reserved table the hostess immediately said, no sorry we’re booked for the rest of the night before even listening to our reservation time and name. I brushed it off until I continued to see her give plenty of attitude to other staff members and even customers.
Our servers service was standard but the food is what ruined it. She had to come back and tell us twice that they were out of both of the dishes we ordered, which were different plates. Waited an hour just to have some of it burnt and some undercooked. NONE of the food, including the bread and app, was worth it especially for the check to be over $100. Our server noticed how much we didn’t enjoy it AT ALL and was nice enough to adjust the bill. We weren’t the only upset customers that night, most left before the food could even arrive. Not returning.< /Review>< Pictures>

A patron since 1988.  Recently, I couldn't decide between an old favorite and the daily special.   At the urging of the server I went for the special.  As the table next to us was served, just a few minutes later I saw both dishes and wanted my old favorite immediately.  I made the request, the server said maybe too late.  Shortly after serving the other table TWO of the four people that selected the special, sent it back to the kitchen after tasting it.  I REALLY didn't want it then.  My husband got up to approach the serving station and follow-up on my request.  Again the server said he would need to check to see if it was too late, clearly he didn't check the first time.  He came back and said it was too late.  The mgr came to the table to ask if everything was okay.  I explained that I had made two requests to change my order, and pointed out that the table next to us sent two orders of the special back to the kitchen.  She said it was too late, and almost ready, and told me I could order two dinners to get what I wanted.  I cancelled my order and watched my husband eat his meal alone.   He offered to leave too, but we had been looking forward to eating at Casanova again.  We're looking for a new favorite restaurant in Carmel.  We have broken up with Casanova since our first visit in 1988.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I love this spot. We made a special trip to Carmel this year to go here for a date night. From the wine to the amazing pork belly appetizer to the carbonara for dinner, it was amazing as always.

This error was not a server miscalculation, this was purely a establishment issue.
Very upsetting!
I caught the mistake but how many others paid without question?
Nobody caught this ? Management? Servers? Hmmmmm

Truly a romantic restaurant with outstanding food and wide selection of wines. I had the steak and frites... the meat was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My wife had the fettuccine with seafood. Again, an awesome dish, the seafood was especially fresh. This is now our go to place when in Carmel.</review>

Loved my lunch here! I had the catch of the day, a very well cooked salmon with potatoes and artichokes, a glass of red wine and as a "dessert", a tasting of artisan cheese and fruit.
The ambiance is fantastic, ideal for a romantic dinner or lunch, with a Mediterranean flair.<//Review>

Not as good as it used to be a few years ago.

Quality and menu selection have slipped. I don't know if management has changed, but it's now over-priced for the quality of food you receive.

My canneloni was nothing I couldn't replicate at home and even make better. My GF's halibut was dry and bland.

It's a shame; this place used to be one of our favorite restaurants but until something changes, we won't be going back.< /text>

<Review>We loved this place the first two times we were there, but tonight's experience has ruined our favorable opinion of them

Most places call their customers if there is going to be an issue with their reservation. This place doesn't feel the need to bother with that courtesy. They're so small they are probably confident that someone will fill the empty spot.

We made reservations for 7:15, but upon arrival were told that we would be sitting outside under the overhang. There are two such tables like that. The rest are inside and the other outdoor tables have no protection from the weather.

We made it known that this wasn't ideal because it was raining, to which she replied in a very condescending tone that it would be a very long wait for a table inside. In an even more irritating and smug tone she said she could provide a blanket if that would be too cold for us.

Restaurant people, please note that customers almost always expect a table inside especially if it's cold and/or rainy outside. Sitting outside is almost never a pleasant surprise. As we scrambled to find another restaurant on OpenTable we noticed that even the Hog's Breath Inn knows to not make reservations for outdoor seating.

Trying to find an open spot at another restaurant at the last minute is almost impossible. All the decent ones are already packed by that time.

We'll never be back, but I'm sure they're not worried. There will be plenty of other potential customers attracted to their gimmick of a house that's been converted to a restaurant. It wears old after a while though.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<text>We wanted to have a special dinner to celebrate our anniversary last Friday night - made a reservation and then stopped by during the day to request a special table which the hostess graciously assured us she marked down and would be taken care or.  When we arrived at the restaurant, a different hostess said every table was special and did not even look into our request, she placed us at a table for two in the middle of a noisy room.  Dinner service was slow and the food less than average and very expensive - we travel a lot and appreciate a good meal and certainly willing to pay for one but this was very disappointing.  My husband's beef dish was very fatty and barely edible.  My roasted vegetables were truly less than impressive - not too much effort was put into that meal.  We purchased a 1/2 bottle of wine that the following night we purchased a full bottle at the same price - also at a Carmel restaurant.  We will not go there again and will not recommend it to our friends.< /text>< pics>

We got this place recommended by a different (booked) restaurant and Casanova was able to squeeze us in on a Saturday night. The Linguini with Sea Food were awesome! The wine list is not a list, it's a book, lots of choices, very impressing! Very kind, thoughtful and kids-friendly (!) service.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>Credit to the chef, excellent! I took couple of stars due to seating location. Was not comfirtable, it was veranda seating by the door. We came earlier and there were plenty of tables but hostess took us to less desirable table in a huge restaurant, unfortunately. We couldnt take of our jackets, it was cold. I wish we had a better table.<//Text><UserId.>104029857164481648482< /UserId.>< time>

Cozy restaurant off the main Carmel strip. Ambiance is rustic and warm, service is top notch. The food comes in smaller portions but is very rich and delicious. The gnocchi is amaazing.< /text>

Double check your bill. Our initial copy was correct but we were charged a much higher amount when the server ran the card.

Apparently other diners have had similar experiences. Seems like a scam.<//review>

Beautiful restaurant with a distinct Italian feel to it. Menu is fairly limited, but every item we tried was quite good. I especially liked the seafood pot.</Review>

We have been coming to this restaurant for the past 10 years. We know the prices are steep and the food is pretty good but it held some sentimental value for us as a family. Sadly we will not be returning as customers. My mom has been struggling with stage four cancer for a couple of years now and we decided to come up for a memorable vacation not knowing if it will be the last. Long story short the experience we had at Casanova was very disappointing. From the moment we got there our waiter was rude and could not answer very simple questions like drink pricing and wine recommendations. Nor did he try and find the answers he seemed bothered by the questions rather than helpful. The carbonara my mother in law ordered was mediocre at best. The dish my parents and I ordered was pretty good (we all had the fettuccini). But when it was time to get our bill we all paid with separate forms of payment which the waiter told us to do since he didn’t want to separate checks. The waiter “accidentally” charged $160 to me twice and managing staff could not return the money because they had to get a hold of the owner. They said they voided both charges but $320 was taken from our account or held. my mother in law was charged with the total bill which was $253. Told us to come back next day to get it resolved. By this point almost $600 is tied up at this one restaurant. 2 days later still unresolved and not put back in our account. Go to Demetra’s better portions better staff, better food.</Review>

<Text>This was out best dining experience this trip in Carmel. First of all, the ambience is very nice. The seats are scattered around the restaurant in small quarters under a roof or outdoors on their open patio with heat lamps, giving every table privacy - usually only a few tables around your own. The service was nice. Out waitress Rachel was not too familiar with ingredients to satisfy our wish to eat eggless vegetarian, so she got someone from management who helped us out. The restaurant seeks to give a small town European flair & it is successful in that. The decorations are also nice. The food was simply outstanding. We had grilled artichoke, but not with the aioli which had egg, but marinated with garlic & butter, & this was simply the best artichoke dish we had. The garlic added a nice flavor. I usually avoid gnocchi, but the spinach gnocchi literally melted in my mouth & was heavenly. We also ordered french fries but simply could not eat that. We will be sure to come back.< /Text>< date>

Last night very upset with Casanova,  my parents went to dinner here for 20 years, my father passed away, so I thought Mom would enjoy eating at their favorite restaurant.  I made reservations 2 days ahead for table for two.  Arrived on time and we were shown to a table for 6 with 3 people already having dinner.  This was to be a special dinner for us, and we were expected to share a meal with strangers.  When we inquired to see if there was a mistake, we were told due to the rain adjustments had to be made.  This ruined our whole evening, and we decided to leave. A manager came out the door after us and offered us a table outside, my mother replied,"we reserved an inside table".  Very disgusted with this restaurant, actually shocked that they would offer an outside table to an 88 year old woman on a cold, damp rainy day.  We went over to Vesuvio, a lovely restaurant, we did not have a reservation, but after explaining what happened they were glad to fit us in.  I am a black and white person and what Casanova did was just plain wrong, sad for you!</text>

<text>Ok let's be honest, Carmel has lots of dog friendly places to eat so while this place is 'nice' and the food is very good the service really let us down.  After a very good meal somehow they forgot about us and our order of wine and desert (the place was only about 70 percent full) and we had to ask for the manger to get our check and resolve things.  We also noticed the family across from us had similar  service problems with an unacceptable  amount of time taking to get their meal and other service items.   With so many options in downtown we probably won't be back.</text>< pictures>

Came here for a private Tag Heuer event and was not disappointed. Quaint, romantic atmosphere, excellent selection of wines and the dishes were amazing. Our entire table went for osso bucco, and everyone raved about it. Filet mignon was delicious as well. We tried warm olives as appetizer, and the quality was enough to share for three people.</review>

Without a doubt one of the best overall dining experiences I've had.  The staff went above and beyond.  Dan our waiter was very interesting, fun, and made our romantic dinner really special.  Food was great too.  Price reasonable for what yu get.  Eating outside with heaters is sooooo nice.</text>

Delicious restaurant and incredible (albeit pricey) wine list. Service was great and the ambiance was pretty good.<//text>

This is our third visit to Casanovas in the last 10 years, and only because we had a $60 gift certificate to waste. Even with our gift certificate accompanying us, our dining experience remained the same as the last 2 visits. Again, we were very disappointed by quality and portions of the dishes as well as the disinterested service we were provided. The restaurant seems to offer just a long list of wines to cater to its European ambiance along with an unexciting menu. We ordered the meat canelloni and the pork ravioli; both dishes tasted like reheated pasta with poor quality meat (greasy and tuff). We had to ask for bread twice, eventually it came 20 minutes after we were served our main dishes. When our bread did arrive, it was chewy and bland. In the end, we opted not to have dessert and felt the $22 out of pocket we spent in addition to the $60 allotted for us on the gift certificate ($82 total) left us leaving the restaurant feeling cheated. I have no regrets saying this is the last time we will be visiting Casanovas together or with friends that come to town.</Text>

<Text>Atmosphere was lovely and romantic, but food was disappointing: underseasoned, without interesting taste range and very highly priced.  With seven of us at the table, only two people had really great dishes.  Creme brulee was really great, so maybe a fun place for wine, appetizers and some creme brulee?<//Text>< rating>

5 different employees came to our table (food order, wine server, delivered bill, picked up bill, etc.). We received someone else's check then waited 20 minutes to find out they didn't accept AmEx cards. Took over a 1/2 hour to leave the restaurant once we finished a very good meal.<//Text>

<date>1532559022647< /date><rating>3<//rating><Text>I've been here 3 times. Each time the expierence is about the same. 3 stars.
Pros
1) Cute setting, looks small from the outside but it's actually really big with lots of little rooms and even a downstairs.
2) Food is fresh

Cons
The food isn't that memorable. Recently I has osso bucco that was very tender and just lightly flavored which was really good. What kept it from great is that it wasn't hot. I think it wasn't reheated fully.

(The gnocchi appetizer is delicious and may be the only memorable dish I've had out of my 3 visits.)

Salad is drenched in dressing (it has been this way all 3 times we've been, we always forget it'll be like that until it arrives). The parm on it is delicious if you can taste it without dressing.

Scallops were just ok. They were cooked perfectly but the avocado mousse was not a good combo with the scallops, strawberries and the trout eggs. I felt like the flavors clashed.

It is known for being a romantic restaurant but that highly depends on where you sit. If say only a small amount of tables would be romantic, the rest are either in a busy walkway and/or in the loud, and draftier larger rooms. Its cute but not romantic.

They put tip amounts on the bill if you want to pay 20% 25% or 30% tip which is really obnoxious! Who pays 30% tip, especially for just an okay experience.

The staff is nice of course, but they're so busy and not always on it as they should be. Took a couple times to order our drinks, didn't supply a drink menu, then I had asked for a lime in my drink and it was forgotten the second round. Not big deal but who tips 20%+ for that?

Then a different person than our server came to close out our bill, as I was looking at it she came over and gave me a new receipt and said it had the bottle of water on it, it was forgotten on the first receipt she gave me. It was awkward and felt rushed. And if you forget a $6 bottle of water that is way overpriced anyways just let it go.

All in all, I'm not impressed.

7D, Tree House and Anton & Michel are all better food/date night options each with their own different style.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Date>1513882598801<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Warning – Stay away from the lower level dining area, it’s extremely cold.

This is also the designated dining area for family with children.

Despite having a fireplace and being told that they had adjusted the thermostat to 85, none of that heat was able to make its way to the dining area which appeared to be without supply vents.

The entire time we were there the room never warmed up and such that we never even removed our jackets.  We also noticed other diners sitting in coats.

Take a note of recent management changes. Wine sommelier, Jeff Birkemeier & the executive chef, David Baron, are no longer there.

Menu selection – very limited, but good
Ambiance – unpleasant due to extremely cold temperature in the dining area

< Review>
Very bad experience. The chef won't work with food allergies at all. The steak wasn't prepared properly and when sent back was returned overcooked and mutilated.  Gordon Ramsay would never let that product leave his kitchen. Still served with no vegetables.  Couldn't even muster up a carrot. By then everyone else was done.  Manager offered a replacement meal so an attempt was made for Seafood pasta without clams and mussels. The manager then alerted that the removed seafood would not be replaced with other seafood in the dish. Instead they just served half an entree. Mind you these meals are over $50 each and they can't come up with vegetables for a steak or two more shrimp to complete an entree. Stear clear of this place. We have fantastic restaurants on Monterey Peninsula, that strive to make sure you have an amazing dining experience. Don't waste a minute here. It will ruin your lovely evening out.<//Review>

Nice ambience, food was hit and miss.
We ordered local cheeses as an appetizer and the presentation and cheese selection was excellent. Cheeses were very fresh and had distinct flavor. The chicken entrée was a disappointment. It was too salty from over brining and the meat texture was dense and rubbery. The garnish vegetables were not the freshest grade. The canelloni dish was also too salty and not anything special. Not likely to visit this place in the future.< /Review>

<text>Let me preface what I'm about to say with "We love dogs!" BUT...
We were celebrating a birthday, and looking forward to a nice meal in Carmel. We arrived on time for a reservation this evening. There were several parties in the outside seating area, all of which seemed to have large dogs accompanying them for dinner. A scuffle broke out between three of the animals; people began pulling their animals apart to avoid a bristled mess. Not a very pleasant entrance for such a touted restaurant. It didn't end there...We entered the building to be met with a woman who barley acknowledged us. She was busy talking to another patron about, you guessed it, his dog. We patiently waited, she fluttered off while another young woman asked if she could help. Yes, thank you. We told her the reservation time, and she seemed genuinely dazed, then said, "You'll need to wait for Christian, she'll seat you." We stepped back awkwardly while a large party of 15 arrived. They sat them while we waited. Funny, another couple came in and this same young woman asked if she could help them. They advised of a reservation, she then responded, "You'll need to wait for Christian." Not quite sure what her roll was in this establishment, but clearly she should not be asking if she could be of any help. The flutterer came back mumbling at the no-help gal "...and we need to take care of Lexor, his dog..."
We did eventually get seated in a couple of uncomfortable wicker chairs and stared at each other. We decided $30 for a ravioli dinner at this restaurant just wasn't worth it. We shrugged, got up and began walking the canine gauntlet. What a hoot. It was PC comical. So many other restaurants that will engage their patrons upon arrival, seat them quickly, and at the very least, treat them better than the dogs. Here's a helpful hint: designate a corner of the restaurant AWAY from your main entrance for dogs, and hint #2: remember, it's the human animal that pays your bills.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have enjoyed casanova's multiple times over the last 15 years. We recently went for dinner and were disappointed. The atmosphere and service were the same, but the food was over priced and not of the excellent quality we had received in the past.  I am a healthy gourmet eater and the portions were pathetic. Also, anytime you are charged $5 for a bottle of ungassed water, because they don't give tap as an option--rip off!</review>

<Text>Despite being loud & excessively priced ($33 for a small pasta w/ no sides), the food was mediocre if that. The sun-dried tomato dip for the breadsticks & the scallops were tasty. "Artisan" bread cost $5. The gnocchi was greasy. The cappellini was thick & the balsamic taste was overpowering. First, it was sprinkled w/ shaved cheese (not described on the menu) so I sent it back. The Christmas lights were unappealing.< /Text>< time>

Very romantic spot - the decor is charming, and the patio is great for lunch. But crucially, it's not only about appearances as the food doesn't disappoint at all! I had a fantastic grilled artichoke (accompanied by a terrific red pepper aioli), followed by a superlative lamb ragu pappardelle (beautiful pasta, tender lamb, great sauce and mushrooms). Service was friendly and effective. Would come back without hesitation.< /text>

Do NOT miss the gnocchi; I dislike gnocchi generally but I was able to taste it during a food tour in Carmel and Casanova's is ethereal.

My wife and I took a trip to the Monterey/Carmel region, and this was the highlight for us. The decor is very old-European; the service was excellent; and the food was good enough to make a second trip to Carmel worth the journey.

For starters, they give everyone a sun-dried tomato tapenade with cheesy cracker sticks. The tapenade is actually good enough to eat with a spoon, which we did because we didn't' want to miss a bit of it. At first, I thought perhaps it was made from roasted tomatoes, but the waitress said it was a mixture of sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and parmesan cheese. At any rate, it was fantastic.

For our entrees, we were in the mood for Italian, so I ordered the spinach gnocchi, and my wife ordered the Linguine Scampi. Both were excellent. The gnocchi sauce was very rich and cheesy. The scamp was also in a cream sauce with heavy basil seasoning, which colored the sauce green. We shared both dishes, and both were excellent as well.

Finally, we wanted to give the restaurant a full vetting, so we decided to order a dessert and share it. We ordered a lemon tart with raspberry sorbet. Again, it was well worth the money, definitely something you would have to come here to get.

In sum, we would definitely make the trip to try the rest of the menu, and I'd recommend it to a friend looking for an upscale Italian or French dining experience.<//review>

Please don't tell anyone about this place...it's already hard to get a table, I guess because the menu, the food, the service, the ambiance are tops.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The atmosphere of the shop is nice, the taste is not too strong, it is not too thin Italian which is just right.
I was surprised at how pasta came.
Carmel by the sea is a cute house atmosphere shop. The clerk was friendly and I had a very nice time.
