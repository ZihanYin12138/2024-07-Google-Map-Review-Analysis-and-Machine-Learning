<review>We’ve loved everything we’ve ordered. From pizza to burgers. All well portioned and tasted great! Very reasonably priced. The owners are so sweet and no matter how busy they get, they treat you like you are the only one waiting. They get the orders out fast and with a smile on their faces. Can’t believe we didn’t know about this place for the first nine months that we lived here. Now it’s an every week thing. Love them!<//review><user_name>DeconstructingWithDawn< /user_name><Gmap_id>0x80c4bc8d31aafc51:0xfcce4630bb3e276f</Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating><time>1606010908575</time><UserId.>101410707258014808509</UserId.><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

It was a very good experience, we met Joe what nice guy, he told us he's been here for more than 30 years. The place is very simple and very clean, Joe is a very nice Korean guy.
The food was outstanding.
By far one of the best philly cheese steak I've ever had, Its well worth checking it out. 👍🏼👌🏼</text>

< Review>
Joe's is always a pleasure. The prices are more than fair. Service is great. The menu is simple, and the food is good. Just like the name it's a country kitchen. Joe and his wife own and run the place, Joe uses all the courtesy and respect one would expect...oh he waits the tables. Order the 2-2-2 for a quick, inexpensive, filling and tasty breakfast, Burgers are great too! Havent tried the pizza yet, this is more of our breakfast goto after *ahem* a late night. But if the pizza is any of the other food it'll be good<//Review>

A very nice spot to kick back and have a great meal. Nice combo menu. I treated him to lunch. His meal lookwd tasty too. I asked for sprite to add to my cranberry juice and joe was fine with replacing my sprite because it was the taste of tonic water. They do many to go orders. The restroom is near you. Just don't ask for dessert. They do have any. Their meal will make you wish for a doughnut shop to be near.<//Text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>(Translated by Google) This is a shop opened by Koreans. I ’m going to eat teriyaki chicken rice. Maybe it ’s not their specialty, so it ’s not very authentic and delicious.

這是家韓國人開的店我是去吃照燒雞飯可能不是他們的專長所以不是很道地和好吃.不过還可以啦畢竟在那個地方有得吃就要偷笑了< /review>< pictures>

My last post was 2 years ago, and it was 5 star. Still 5 star for all I've tried, and be sure you try their burritos, great little but thick cheese burger, tasty tortas and their wonderful 7 marse's seafood soup, my Favorite!</Review>

<Review>I love this place. Me and my husband sometimes come every week. They have the BEST carnitas. We usually share a burrito because they are so huge and a 6 pack of pacificos. They have amazing chips and salsa and we very frequently buy a quart of their salsa and a bag of fresh chips to take home with us.<//Review>< pics>

Really nice market, lots to choose from small as it looks from the outside. Ordered food and ate in. Had the taco salad and the chile Verde, a must try! Heck a good! Server was very nice and they also hook you up with chips and salsa to start!< /Review>

The food is quite good & this place is located at the very edge of town. The atmosphere is somewhat lacking & sometimes you have to yell to hear each other over the kitchen & folk music. My favorite is the overstuffed soft taco in a flour tortilla. The food is worth it though.< /Review>

Pretty average food.  Nice people, good for a quick inexpensive bite, but nothing to write home about.  I really wish I felt differently as it is close to me and I would frequent the place if it were a little better.  I am a good cook so I am pretty picky as Mexican food is not that difficult.  The salsa is good. They have some true mexican spices and products that are good as well and hard to find.  And you can pick up a twelve pack while grabbing dinner, so that is a plus too!<//text>

I would highly recommend not only Rosales Market but, Beaulahs for Breakfast and lunch! Owned by the same very hardworking family. Can't say enough about both places!!!❤</Review>

<Text>I can easily say this is my favorite place to eat in Middletown. I am always greated with a smile and treated with respect.  I like to enjoy my lunch at this place once a week and it's usually their busiest time so the wait could be up to 20 minutes, but it is totally worth it. Tortas, fajitas, delicious burritos, and Deadpool's favorite, chimichangas. The salsa is great too. Check them out!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

We have a 2 year old who was quiet and asleep in our arms. Two ushers rushed to us and asked us, to put our child in some sort of unknown church daycare because “Pastor would prefer she not enter. Her playful sounds will hinder our recording.”  They then stopped another young couple and did the same.

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE AND DANGEROUS PRACTICE!

Every time I attend there is a Rhema Word for me. Every time. Every Time I bring a guest there is a Word applicable to their current situation. Every Time. The worship touches God's heart and mine every time, Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did.<//Text>

< review>
That church rocked! The last time I went there was back N January 2009. Wish I was still attending, & still hearing the attendees cry out to the Most High! I also wish I lived Nx door to the house of the Lord. I miss it, & hopefully I will find a way to get back to that wonderful, glorious house of God! I became a member of Antioch back N May 2008, & I was real proud of it. My former Sister N Law found out by saying "Oh, I didn't know you joined Antioch, that's good". When I first attended it back N April 2008, i was given papers to fill out, & when the pastor told us to go around & say hello to everyone, the song " we're blessed N the city (we are blessed) was playing. My stepniece was baptized there. The band can really rock the hooouuussse! Wayne & Myesha Chaney R really awesome folks.
What I also miss, that @ the end of the service, while the pastor was speaking, his wife sang "choose life" N the background. The day before my 30th cake day, there was a saxophonist getting down performing the same tune! Because of that, I just want to revive those days.</review>

Seamless experience and excellent customer service. I ordered flowers to be sent to my Mother (I live in NYC) through the tower florist website for same-day delivery. Sadly, we had a family death due to the pandemic. The website was easy to navigate, the pictures of the flowers were very helpful and the product arrived AS IT WAS depicted in the picture. My mother was very happy with the arrangement and will be sending me a pic to post soon - THANK YOU TOWER FLORIST< /text>

I ordered the lovely “Sweet Passion” flower basket from Tower Florist  for my mom’s birthday and was able to be delivered same day! It was the most beautiful flowers she has ever received. They were exactly as pictured and larger than expected (an awesome surprise). Definitely worth the money and the smile on her face :)</review>

I ordered this bouquet as an Anniversary Gift because these were their original wedding colors. The recipients sent me a picture of it on their table, wow, it looked just like the order image! Great service having a quick turn-around delivery and the most beautiful perfect flowers!< /text>

Tower Florist really "delivers" - both in beautiful arrangements and in service.  We gave the florist the wrong delivery address.  They tracked us down and waited for the correct address.  Recipient was very happy.< /text>

We ordered flowers for my husband’s sister. It was her first anniversary since her husband passed away two months ago and we wanted her to have some flowers since he had always gotten them for her. We ordered the Sweet Tranquility basket. She was so happy with them and called us right away to tell us how beautiful they are. Thanks for helping cheer her up on such a difficult day.</Text>

My son and girlfriend, who live in Washington,  sent me flowers for my birthday that they ordered from Tower Florist.  The arrangement was stunning white daisies, red carnations, a button yellow flower and lovely greenery.  The flowers lasted 20 days!!  The last days I repurposed the flowers into three smaller arrangements.  Also the vase used was very lovely, not made of cheap plastic.  Flowers are always a lovely gift, but are also expensive Tower gives you beauty and value!!  I have also purchased roses at Tower for my granddaughter’s dance recitals. These roses also where very lovely and lasted for over 10 days and each bud opened up beautifully. This is a quality florist who knows flowers and gives you great value.  Excellent,Outstanding, Stunning!!!< /text>

Tower Florist created a beautiful design for my daughter's house warming arrangement. She called me with delight in her voice and I was very pleased. Since she just moved to Sacramento and I will definitely be using Tower Florist again. Thank you so much!</Text>

Beautiful arrangement! My mother received it for Mother's Day and she is absolutely in love with her flowers. They were just as gorgeous as they are pictured.
Thank you Tower Florist for making sure that the flower arrangement was delivered on time and for making my mother's day extra special.
Tower Florist went the extra mile to deliver this arrangement. After the drivers many failed attempts, Ana personally delivered them to my mother's door after her shift.
I appreciate your efforts and thank you with all my heart! ♥</review>

<time>1568399999402</time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Of course, I waited until the last minute to send flowers to my wife for our anniversary but the crew at Tower Florist really pulled through for me.  They made it happen so she didn't know the difference. I called first thing in the morning, to see if they could deliver a dozen vased-roses the same day, and they said they would try to work it into their schedule. My wife loved them!!  They were able to deliver within a few hours, and based on the volume of pics she sent me, the arrangement was beautiful, and they didn't look like it was rushed to be put together.  They looked beautiful.  Thank you so much!!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Thurs 04/26 So friendly, courteous and helpful when I phoned from England for a friend's funeral flowers. Would highly recommend. Thank you Mandy & team!
Sunday 04/29 To add to my review... I have just received photographs of the floral arrangement I ordered, from my friend's family. Absolutely stunning & gorgeous. Far exceeded what I thought! First class. Exactly as described but even more so! Many many thanks again.< /text>

Nice flowers with custom arrangements upon request. It's a smaller shop but able to cater to your needs. Delivery available for the greater Sacramento area or choice of wire out for other areas if desired. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.</Text>

Wanted to pick up an arrangement for a neighbor who just lost her husband.  They had a number of arrangements all done up and one caught my eye.  Great price and so fresh.  Nice friendly people.  I will be back.

(Looks like they are already getting things in for Valentine's Day.)</Review>

Ordered flowers for delivery to my girlfriend on St. Valentine's Day. Purchased the 'Perfect Dozen' and upgraded to premium, which added $30 to the arrangement which "[they'll] add more blooms and select the highest quality flowers we offer in this style." The Deluxe upgrade "Additional flowers will be added to enhance the bouquet." Well, no additional flowers were added, 4 of the dozen were already wilting pretty bad, then my girlfriend noticed there was hardly any water in the large vase, maybe a quarter to half a cup of water. Photo shows Eucalyptus Baby Blue in it but there was none, just a lot of leather fern and lemon leaf, and seeded eucalyptus along with gold glitter curly sticks. Overall, spent almost $150 on a $80 quality arrangement. I picked this place because it had the highest rating in the area, but that's not true at all.</text>

The Tower Florist is my new favorite find, best customer service too! I picked up a beautiful green plant decorated with a pretty green bow and mesh for my cousin, in such a solemn time for the family, I'm sure this plant will be a warm reminder of the loved one lost.< /text>

The food was good.
I recommend Garbage and Pizza rolls.
Slightly overpriced.
The amount of salmon on the Washington roll was just the bare minimum to be considered "acceptable".
Service was very slow. We waited 15min just to get water. And never got refilled.< /Review>

The service here is amazing and it usually gets crowded at lunch and dinner. The food is generally good most of the time, there are times when it's a bit too salty and takes away from the taste. Overall I would recommend this place if you're looking for a nearby place for Japanese food.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

This is one of my favorite spots for lunch near our office! Little Tokyo is a cozy spot in the Carmel Mountain Plaza for Japanese cuisine.

Usually we grab lunch to-go. Lunch bento boxes have a lot of food and a HUGE variety of bites for a fair price ($10-11).

Service has already been excellent each time we've been to Little Tokyo.

PROPS: Tasty food and fair prices.
SLOPS: Average quality sushi.<//review>

Service was poor and the waiter was not attentive at all. The sushi was flavorless and soggy and anything tempered was not crunchy. Would not recommend and was extremely pricey. Not worth it.</review>

Always love coming here. Friendly, prompt service. Consistently good food. Sushi is fresh and clean tasting. Favorite is the chicken katsu, tender, flavorful, and just the right amount of batter to make it crispy. Miso is delicious, just the right amount of saltiness for Tokyo style miso. We're here regularly.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>2:30 pm, I was the only sushi bar customer and only 3 other customers at tables. Had to wait 12 minutes for sushi chef (2 working) to come out of back to take my order. Placed order for 1st roll and got it and waited 10 minutes after eating it and asked the waitress to tell the chef I wanted another roll, waited another 12 minutes and both chefs came out of back and he could not understand what I wanted, a roll that I had been buying there for over 10 years, ended up arguing with him and the waitress came over to interpret...waitresses are fantastic, but chefs customer service rates a 0!!! You could not pay me to go back there and a had been a semi regular customer since the restaurant opened!!< /Review>< Response>

We picked up take out sushi tonight, and when we got home we discovered that the avocado was brown with spots all over it, every roll was like that!  Very dissatisfied with the quality of food! The avocado was rotten and the cucumber was translucent. When I called to complain I was told that avocado goes brown, well I know that! but any sushi take out should be fresh and no brown spots all over it. We always get sushi take out, and this is unacceptable. I asked for a credit card refund and they said that I needed to bring the food back,  I live 20 minutes away, no way! They said that I was taking advantage of them, and that they wanted proof. I explained that I was already home with 3 kids, and could not go. They insisted and I told them that I could not at that moment. They then said that they wanted my signature to do the refund, I told them once again that I could not drive there. They said they voided the transaction, I will confirm with Amex. Little tokyo was good a few years ago, lately it has been mediocre to bad. Aside from take out, we also liked eating there. The Last dine in meal we had there, we complained about ripe hard avocado and bad service (slow, 1 waiter, forgot items, etc), we will NEVER return!  Will now go to sushi on the rock in 4s ranch, very sad, as we had so many fond memories of family celebrations at little tokyo sushi. Oh well! this is how you lose customers! with bad quality food and bad service.</Text>

The rolls were good and big. However the service was a bit slow. Our server took some time to get our order or even get us drinks. Otherwise the experience was ok.</Review>

My favorite sushi restaurant in Rancho Bernardo (and I've been to at least 5.) Their edemame is by far the best in the entire region, and their miso soup is also some of the best in the area!</text>

Well stocked and busy. I wish I could test ride a $23k bike without having to commit and provide my own insurance first but it’s never been any different I guess.< /review>

< review>
Found a 1985 Nighhawk 700S on Simi Valley Cycle's website.  Called and talked to Rick who was very helpful and honest about the condition of the bike.  I was 700 miles away but decided to take him on his word that the bike was in excellent condition.  My son and I drove down and it was as he said, perfect.  Rick was great to work with and it was a very easy and fast purchase.  Everyone at the shop was very nice and helpful. They helped me load it up in my truck and get me on my way back home.  All in all it was a great experience working with Rick and Simi Valley Cycle.  Only wish they were closer.<//review>

Also, don’t listen to some of these negative reviews.  The entire team knows what their doing and are very friendly.  Not to mention their prices are amazing.  Set of tires cost me cheaper than ordering them online, AND they had them in stock, AND installed them the same day! (with a discount for buying them their) Can’t beat that.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Looking for a jet ski and just got off the phone with the sales guy. He said "sorry the owner put a ridiculous price on it... $16K". As a Yamaha Dealer, this is tru price gouging! MSRP is $9k. I'll take my business elsewhere and I would recommend you do the same.<//Review>< user>

I damaged my tires hitting debris on the 101 freeway. They went out of their way to get my tires and have them mounted so I could make my trip. Because of that first impression. I am a loyal customer. Recently I needed tires again, their price was better than anyone around. Ive taken my bike for oil changes and brake pads and received quality work and quick turnaround.

This is applicable to the Service Department.
Same rating and review left on Yelp!

Executive Summary:
If I could give this business a 'zero' rating, I would.  One star is too much.  Don't waste your time and find another Triumph Service location.

Details:
Scheduled the break-in service for my Triumph with this place thinking they would be a good place to establish a Service relationship for the future of my motorcycle ownership; bad move!
The Service Rep Chris (spelling?) was rude, condescending, and disrespectful.   He didn't get up from his chair or bother to look me in the eye while I arrived at the Service area.  Which, by the way is tucked in the back, like you're going into someone's backyard...
Anyway, as he proceeded to ask his questions, he was giving out the feeling that he was bothered by my presence and couldn't wait to get me out of there.  Not sure if he was having a bad day, but it was right after they had opened and it couldn't have been better in terms of outside temperatures (after a scorching Southern California summer).

His demeanor was so rude and condescending that I asked if he had something against me or a problem with me bringing my bike for service.  Obviously, he says no...

I decided to go somewhere else, asked for my keys and left; that was the best decision, other than buying a Triumph, to-date!
LA Cycle Sports took care of me, paid attention to what I was asking, and took the time to explain the service.  They were on my bike right away without an appointment.  Talk to Joey there, he will take care of you and respect your questions/concerns.< /Text>

I worked with Joe and Rick to purchase a 2018 Beta 300rr and I couldn't be happier! The process was straightforward with no surprises or shenanigans. These guys appreciate your time and business, I will definitely be back for my another bike. They had the bike ready, signed the paperwork, out the door and on my way home in less than 45 minutes.<//text>

This place should be an historical landmark. It's been in business in the same location since 1967! It's a family business with a family feel. Parts, apparel, 3 different brands of motorcycles, Suzuki, Yamaha and Triumph. Duane and crew will treat you right, give them a call!<//Text>

Was a bit concerned buying a bike over the internet. The people there were very patient answering all of my questions. The staff was extremely helpful, going so far as to pick me up from the train station when I came down to see the bike. The condition of the bike was exactly as described and the deal was exactly what we had agreed to on the phone. I have over 20 years in the auto business and I would recommend Simi Valley Cycles above anyone I have felt with. Great people, great service definitely worth checking out.<//text>

Had a great experience the first time I came here to buy my son's YFZ50. Despite living in Santa Clarita, I wanted to ensure they had my business when I bought my Raptor 700 a few months later. These guys really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel valued. I'll be back when it comes time to upgrade again.</Review>

Bought my first bike here 6 weeks ago - in short, walked out the door with a Yamaha R3 with 97 miles on it at a crazy rad price and couldn't be happier. I've upgraded with some minor mods, light details and got my license since that glorious day in late July.
Melvin and Kevin were great, and have called every few weeks to check in on the status of the bike. Although I haven't needed anything yet, I know they'll be there when I do. Thanks guys!< /text>

I really wanted to like this company. I am new to town, and they are my local service department. But what an absolute disappointment.
My bike needed minor repairs from a minor accident. A week and a half went by, and I never heard from them. I had to call them. The guy that answered the phone admittedly didn’t know anything about the bike, and gave me a $3000 invoice. That was obviously wrong, and he was listing parts that were never damaged.
I traveled down there, and it was $700.
Another week goes by, they tell me the bike will be ready.
The week I’m supposed to pick it up, they say they discovered another part that requires repair. So they keep the bike.
In all, they had the bike for seven weeks, the price jumps to 1k.
What a disappointing experience, and a disappointing company. This was not a positive experience. They will not receive future business from me, and they have lost future positive word of mouth.
My advice for all of you seeking a repair shop, look elsewhere. Of all the bike shops I’ve worked with, this is the most weak. They should not be carrying the Triumph name.</text>

{'time': 1573167250295, 'text': "Nobody can please this customer. All this info was written under anger due to this guy crashing his new bike with 14 miles. He did not get his bike here, thank you, he was mean when he 1st came in, however we treat all customers like Family. Service quoted him a price to make his bike new, (we would never quote undamaged parts), but Brett decided to do the minimum, which we quoted $700. We also told Brett a part was backordered for 3 weeks. When Brett said he called and spoke to someone, it was a salesperson that knew nothing about his bike. Should have called Service. When we finished the bike the Tech test rode it. The Bike was not ridable when it came in and we suggested a brake rotor. Brett authorized it knowing it takes 1 week to have the part here and would be $1000 total. It was done on time, detailed too. So we did everything to help this customer. We have one of the best Triumph Tech's in the Industry who takes pride in his work. Some people can never be happy."}< /Response>

So I was just reading some of the low reviews and you can tell these are the guys that just want everything done for free on their timeline. I am in no way connected to Simi cycles however I have been in Simi my whole life. I have done business with them for close to 20 years. I have never purchased anything but I went with a good friend he bought a Yamaha yxz from then and got an excellent price and great service. I have had them do many services for my toys and always pull through. Last year I had a rhino that I just installed long travel on and one axle blew up. I called them and brought it in and repaired it the next day. They even waited a half hour after hours in the rain for me to be able to pick up my part for a trip the next day. The service from these guys is what you expect from a home town family business and nothing less. They didn't have to wait after hours for me but they did. They will continue to get my business and referalls</Review>

Duane is a great dude. Always easy to work with. Bought many bikes over the years. The guy rides too which is rare these days. Dave in parts is a legend. He has everything in stock or will get it fast. Great dealership and I try to stay away from most. These guys make going to the dealer a great experience. Thanks< /review>

First time buying a cycle off the internet was a bit nervous. Sales crew was patient and took the time to answer all of my questions. Went so far as picking me up from the train station when I came down to see the bike. Condition was exactly as described, deal was exactly as agreed to on the phone. Simi Valley Cycles made the whole process enjoyable. I have over 20 years experience in the auto business and I would recommend  them above anyone. GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT EXPERIENCE,  DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT!</Text>

Simi Valley Cycles - Duane runs a great shop and has always been helpful with rider support. Small but awesome shop, good prices and parts needed are generally in stock or quick to get. Give them a try as you will not be disappointed. Ask for Duane and tell him to that Nick sent you!

Suzuki, Yamaha and Beta, motocross and street... I’ve been a customer since the late 90’s and still make the 45 minute drive each way.< /Text>

<text>Updated and edited review: Customer service in the service department can be bad. (My story below.) If you want service work done in Simi... you may want to consider one of the other options in town.

I've bought high end gloves and occasional parts here. Very large selection of bikes, great selection of gloves during the summer, smaller selection in the winter. Good selection of other gear.  Some of their sales people seem pretty cool, although I've never actually shopped for a motorcycle here.

My last experience here is the last time I'll go here for service at least, maybe last time ever.  (I MIGHT still check this place out when shopping for bikes, because their selection is seriously impressive.) I took a wheel and tire in to get mounted. A day and a half later, I still hadn't heard from them.  I called to find out what was taking so ridiculously long. Turns out they had just "forgotten" to call me to let me know it was done. I went in to pick it up, and they charged me twice what it should have cost. I commented on the insane price--the person checking me out still didn't realize there was a problem.  I thought I'd just gotten screwed, paid my bill and left, never to return.  After leaving a scathing review here, they called me, apologized claiming it was a mistake, and refunded half of my money. This brought the cost down to a reasonable $25 (approx. w/ tax and disposal fee).  Was it an unforgivable mistake?  No, but why bother going back here when there are so many other shops that have treated me quite well?  This explains why all my friends would say "Eh... they're okay... but I go to _______" about this place. YMMV.<//text>< Pics>

"I put my Moto Guzzi on consignment and 15 minutes after signing the paperwork, the ad on the SVC website was live. I then made a new motorcycle purchase which was executed flawlessly by the SVC Team. All staff are caring and knowledgeable. I got an amazing price on my new V-Strom and I am one very happy customer. I worked with the parts department on getting new panniers and got a great discount. Financing was easy and explained very clearly to me. I've been riding motorcycles for some 30 years and this is hands down the best buying experience I've ever had. Thanks guys! Great job!!! Neal"< /review>

Good motorcycle store. They service all types and brands. Great tire prices but you must ask for the best price. They deal Yamaha , Triumph and some quads don't know the brand. Parts guys are good and knowledgeable, service dept guys are personable. Sales guys are sales guys bahaha made myself laugh they're nice guys too. They have used bikes of all types. And a nice big flat parking lot that's easy to maneuver in. 3/29/19 just had a bad experience, I'm now wondering if its under new management or ownership. I'm not gonna stop going but I'm going to have to really hold them to there word. So we'll see. I'll keep it at four stars for now. (Check that) A couple days later I just need to mention. The bad experience here forced me to another town and bike shop. Now I do business over there and get services as well, better pricing and willingness to work with you. At SVC the service department and parts department are separated.(this is a bad thing). This process has caused some of my problems they really need to get together and standardize the parts department & service department . It would be nice to do business in the town where I live. . .</Text>

I was decided on what I wanted before contacting Duane, just needed the bike available and correct price. He contacted me when he said he would, and made a fair deal for me. Never pushy, happy to answer my questions, and appreciated my business. They also helped me out with parts, and ordered what I needed for pick up day.<//review>

Literally the entire staff deserves recognition for their consistently outstanding service. I got a brand new bonneville t120 black and haven't stopped grinning since it was delivered. Just took it in for it's first scheduled service and sweet baby Jesus they've got it purring. 10/10 would recommend.<//Review>

<text>Great Customer Service from the sales dept., the parts and accessories dept, and even the guy who prepped my new bike. They knew I was not able to get there any earlier due to my job, so all these guys stayed late to get me taken care of. My bike was assembled, prepped, paperwork was ready, and even got all my gear right then and there!!!
Thank you very much...</text>< Name>

< review>
Was out in Simi Valley to meet my friend for a ride. I had no side mirrors on my Yamaha R6 (long story) and I needed something to get me by til the ones I ordered came in the mail. Well for $13.00 I got a side mirror, looked ugly but it worked. Looked at the new bikes and wasn't overly bothered by salespeople other than the quick greeting when coming in and a short talk about older bikes. Seems like a decent place with knowledgeable people.  This will be one of my stops next year when looking to buy a new bike.</review>

<Text>Simi Valley Cycles takes the time to care for their customers, even long after the sale is made. Staff, all the way up to the ownership took the time to ensure the customer is 100% satisfied and cared for. Although a misunderstanding, they took the time to make it right, and that speaks volumes in who they are, what they stand for and their position as pillar in Simi Valley community as locally owned and operated business.

Thank you SVC!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Skip other bike shops and go here. I bought a 2017 Yamaha FZ-09 from them in early August. They do test rides which other bike shops don't allow, I got a way better deal on the bike and trade-in than the other bike shop, and Rick in sales as well as the other staff in parts and service were all just great people. They all ride and love bikes. I felt like family. Go see Rick at Simi Valley Cycles!<//Review>

I called on Thursday and Rick gave me a quote. Saturday morning drove 2 hours to get to SVC. Upon arrival met Rick. He showed me the bike which was already prepped for a test ride. 1 hour later after enjoying a nice conversation with the Finance Manager the bike was in the back of my truck heading home. Will definitely buy from SVC again. A+</text>

Nicest, friendliest, most honest place to buy from. I bought my very first m/c from Duane back in 1994, I did go to the "Mega M@II" place once to buy my son a kx85 and service/prep was non-existant. Will never shop anywhere else when I get the urge for 2 wheels! I also like the fact they are local and have what is needed. Don't hesitate to shop here, help keep the small businesses going so we don't have to resort to shopping on the computer.< /Review>

I am really glad I went to Simi Cycles to look at the Triumph motorcycles. I visited a place out in the valley and I thought their prices were a little high.

Simi Cycles prices on these were great, and they know alot about there products to.

Good staff.<//text>

<text>We recently purchased a 2018 YZ450 from SVC, what a great experience.  The bike has a new ignition and electronics which we were unfamiliar with. Duane and his team took time to be sure we understood how it worked and we were completely satisfied.  I have bought a lot of motorcycles in my life and SVC has the best sales, service and parts team anywhere.  It is a pleasure just walking into the store. Thanks to you all!<//text>< Pictures>

<Name>brad carter</Name><review>Ok, let me start by saying that i am a pain in the **s kind of customer.  I shop and look and test drive and shop and shop, and i am always afraid of paying too much.  i also don't like bike dealers sales staff in general as these guys just do not listen.

Now, let me say how AWESOME my experience was, and i cannot tell you the last time i even took the time to make a review...maybe once 8 years ago?

These guys are quick, painless, professional, honest, and even friendly!  Rick took the lead as i was internet lead, and answered every question i asked and he knew the programs off the top of his head (one dealer i went to didn't even know they had low interest finance or that extras were included in the sale from the manufacturer!)  Every time i sent an email i got one back no matter how little the question was. No one ever told me they would need me to set up a "VIP Appointment" to get the best deal!!!!  lol!!!

Pricing?  They won't get beat, but to be honest, they had great pricing out of the gate, and no need to haggle.   Very fair!  Better than fair probably.

After the sale i wanted to add accessories, and without having to ask i was offered a discount on anything i wanted!   Andy in PARTS was great. Knows his stuff, and told me he would ship my parts to me because i am not local.  Called back in later and spoke to him again and same great service!  OH!  And they have tons of selection!  Anything you need they have it!  I'm lucky my wife was with me or i would have shopped and picked up more great accessories!  Helmets gloves jackets and anything else you can think of.  A little place that's bigger inside than you may think.

Kevin the Finance guy was so quick and really painless.  Even my wife was surprised at how fast he got us through the process.

What can i say?  I wish i lived closer because the Service dept has a great rep as well.  I may even take a trip for service, just because if they do that half as well as the sales end i'll be happy!

Great place to do business.  Highly recommend!<//review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>I'm on my third Simi Valley Cycles motorcycle.  I ride 100 miles just to get to them - this last time in the rain.  They are amazing with service - even recalls they'll exchange emails and attached documents and let me know when the parts come in.  And if I'm on my 3rd bike with them, they also will work with you as much if not more than the others on the bottom line.  Living in Santa Barbara County, I don't travel as far as Simi just because I like to ride - I have yet to find anyone to touch Simi with professionalism, responsiveness and courtesy.  And this last time I was there, Dewayne gave me the chance to ride a bike I've been lusting over - the Yamaha FZ10, which nobody in Santa Barbara County would do.  Why wouldn't I come back?  I can even visit my friends at the Rock Store on the same trip!  I have some local friends who also feel the same way, willing to make that trip to visit Simi and Dewayne's crew.< /review>< Resp>

I took my 2013 Triumph Daytona 675R to the shop for mechanical work. Their mechanic did a great job on the bike, and just about everybody in the back are super cool and easy going. SVC is a great place to bring your speedy two wheels rocket in for mechanical works or basic maintenance. Overall, this is a great motorcycle shop with great people.</Review>

<Review>New triumph owner here!! Thanks to Rick in sales. I have always wanted a Bonneville since my dad had one when I was growing up. Now I have one. Just wanted to say this guy is super knowledgeably about Triumphs. I mean I went into a couple other dealers Like Cal coast and To powersports. And i went with SVC because of their down to earth feel, and I think this is how the shop would be back in the 70's. Really laid back, but still very informative. Don't go anywhere else. Plus parts department is quick and very helpfull, and just all around I love this place. Thanks again!!!!</Review><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

<text>Showroom is acceptable and the salesman are cool (+2 stars). Service department is incompetent. The shop is dirty and disorganized. The few technicians they have are slow and inexperienced. They had my bike for a month and a half when the mechanic finally got around to diagnose the bike that i took there for a malfunctioning taillight. Then he calls me and tells me there is an electrical problem he didn't think he could fix and to come pick up my bike. Ok. I go pick it up and have a bill totaling $612 for parts and labor on spark plugs, air filter, and oil change. And the bike stays locked up until I pay. Ok so i got burned..but then i get the bike home and now it has a gas leak. Go figure (-3 stars).
My advice, go there if you want but spend the time to check out some other shops. I had to drive a little out of my way but found a place that was far more professional. My bike was up and running in 3 weeks and haven't had a problem since.

<Review>SVC is by far the worst motorcycle dealer in Ventura County, if not all of Southern California.  Their parts department does not carry a large inventory insuring that their customers will have to wait.  Their service department is staffed by young, untrained technicians who perform shoddy work.

I purchased a motorcycle from them in 2001.  Two years later it developed an intermittent missing problem and I brought it to them under warranty.  They tried on three separate occasions to find and repair the problem and couldn't.  They ended up giving the bike back to me un-repaired.  I then brought the bike to a competing dealer who diagnosed and located the problem in 10 minutes, ordered the part and returned my motorcycle in three days.

While SVC had my motorcycle the last time under warranty, they kept it for 4 weeks, broke my carburetor float bowls, glued them back together with epoxy, replaced defective parts with used ones, stored it outside in the rain (customary for them) and they returned the motorcycle to me completely filthy and corroded.  They refused to repair the damage they had caused or even detail the bike.

I highly recommend that you avoid Simi Valley Cycles.< /Review></record>

<review>I had a serious financial loss with a pay cut at work. A couple years back and started saving money. I started looking into motorcycles for better gas mileage. I saw that the Drz 400 got around 65 MPG!!!! So I shopped around alot and found that Simi Cycles had really good prices. And being the closest to me. I went in and wound up getting the DRZ. Now i am saving money on my gas... ALOT. But the major kicker is that I got qualified to not pay any interest for five years on my loan. I am so glad that I went in and bought this bike. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend this shop to other riders. Hope to see any of you out there. Or maybe at the parts counter!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80e8291e4f851455:0xe00b4bcfdbb69d73</gmap_id></record>

I highly recommend Dr. Chane to friends and family. 5 years ago I was struggling to figure out what was happening with my heart. I wasn't able to play with my kids and go out with them. 5 years later, Dr. Chane has made a huge impact on my life. I am able to spend quality time with my family without having to worry about my heart. Dr. Chane and the entire staff are amazing. They do whatever it takes to make sure I get what I need. 12/10 would recommend!!< /Text>

Always treated with the most professionalism. Always willing to go above and beyond. Awesome teamwork here. Came in for venous reflux and ulcers. Was treated right away and feeling so much better as ever. My son has special needs and they are so patient with him in his needs. The office is always so clean and the staff always greeted with a smile. Thank you California heart and Vein Specialists!</Text>

Dr. Chane is excellent, pleasant, knows his business and performs without issue.  The staff are dedicated individuals who are knowledgeable with their function and reliable to secure factual answers if they are unsure. There is no wait time in this office, every one is diligent in their jobs and responsive to the patient -- me. Prior to  seeing Dr. Chane I experienced severe leg cramps every night, to a point where I was unable to stand, for a few years.  After a series of four ablations  over 5 weeks, there is no more pain, I can sleep all night.  I  strongly urge anyone who is considering this procedure - see Dr. Chane.<//text>

<text>2 years ago, I came to Dr. Chane's office complaining of severe swelling in my pain and legs. Dr. Chane recommended that I do an ultrasound and then complete vein treatments. After spending countless hours at this office, I can speak to the patience and dedication of the staff. The results of the treatments speak for themselves.  I recommend Dr. Chane for your Heart and Legs!</text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

I rotated in this clinic with a great intensive learning experience for one month. Dr. Chane and medical staffs provided me a good environment of learning. The nurse practitioners, Tina and Tiffany, are very knowlegable and warm as well.

This clinic provides nuclear stress test, echocardiogram, exercise stress test, leg vein ablations to patients, and Dr. Chane also do coronary angiogram in near hospitals, so it will be a great chance for you to experience cardiovasular medicine. Also, the variety of patients will give you an insight of practicing cardiology. It has been my honor to rotate in this place. I recommend this place for IM rotation.<//review>

Dr is very thorough and efficient.. Always very pleasant. Easy access to the office and the employees are great I love to watch the students doing  there  thing because there are new at it I can see some little mistakes they make they don’t know .
When I visit his office with some leg pain he gives me some advice and he seems to be right I’ll just go home and do what he says it works that ibuprofen.  Dr. Chane Is very accurate and knows what he’s doing.<//Text>

First of all , A BIG THANKS to Dr. Majed Chang and all his staff for providing an excellent and exceptional medical services for patients specially for my father who took 35 sessions of the ECP treatment procedures.

My father was told by various heart specialists and doctors that need to have a heart by pass surgery or open hear surgery which was extreme a tough decision for our family specially in this Covid-19 pandemic but when visited Dr. Chan, we were surprised and excited with the treatment process he brought up to our attention and we were proudly happy to gone through his preferred rout of treatment.

I highly encourage and recommend this practice and express my pleasure for every single individual who helped us during this critical condition.< /review>< pics>

I have been a patient since 2008 and my experience with the physicians and staff is very positive.  Whatever the procedure happens to be, they walk you through the process and are very considerate with the patient.

Dr. Chan is very thorough and effective in what he does; I have the highest regard for him!

I highly recommend this office!

<Review>My name is Miguel, and I am an Internal Medicine Resident (PGY-1 categorical) at Fairview Hospital of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio.
As an IMG and applicant to a medical residency training program here in the United States, I was looking for clinical rotations last year. I was fortunate to have found California Heart and Vein Clinic to rotate.

During my rotation through Dr Chane’s clinic, I learned how to put the theoretical concepts into the practice of cardiology. And beyond the clinical aspects, I also learned how to lead an exceptional healthcare team and to optimize time during busy schedules.

Academically, we reviewed and discussed journal articles on current progresses in cardiology, as well as topics presented in congresses like the World Congress of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology. I had access to the current issues of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) and other resources. Dr Chane helped me fine-tune my presentation abilities and grasp the most important concepts of the topics presented. I had the opportunity to write an article about one of the topics I presented; Dr Chane reviewed the article and we submitted it to a medical journal. Another very remarkable aspect of my academical training during this rotation, was learning to read echocardiograms and nuclear cardiac imaging in order to make a diagnoses.

What an excellent experience it was to shadow Dr. Chane! It was critical for my matching. The outstanding letter of recommendation he gave me added significant weight to my application.

I invite applicants to a medical residency training program in the United States to come a rotate at California Heart and Vein Clinic.<//Review><resp>None</resp><pics>None< /pics><userid>118288613030511730611< /userid>< Rate>

I wish I could give Dr. Chane 10 stars; everyone here is so lovely, professional, kind and respectful to the elders. Because of Dr. Chane's procedures on my legs, it has given me vast, incredible, extensive benefit to my abilities to function, exercise and enjoy my life. He has saved my legs and my health on multiple occasions. Dr. Chane's mannerisms and methods are always excellent, and respectful. The entire staff is so wonderful, the office extends respect dignity, kindness and concern to all patients. I have recommended my best friends and I would highly recommend anyone to come to this place, without a moment's hesitation, it will change your life for the better!</review>

<Text>Just wanted to share my mom's experience with Dr. Chane in Huntington Beach, CA. My mom had heart surgery through Dr. Chane and has been treating her for a little over a year. Dr. Chane has made such a huge difference in my mom's life since her heart surgery and vein ablation on both legs and is now a completely different person with the success of her treatments. We are so grateful to Dr for helping my mom. She has a better quality of life now that she feels like a new person.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Too bad there is only 5 stars to give because i would give this office a 10! Dr. Chane has patience with his patients. To release your stress he is very kind and comforting. especially when it comes to the Vein Ablations and Left Heart Cathereization Procedure. He's very concentrated in his work. He has great bed side manners. His Nurse Practitioners are wonderful.  The staff are very nice. i would recommend anybody to have Dr. Chane be your Cardiologist.</review>

Dr. Chane is the best Cardiologist in all of Orange County. He is great! I have been his patient for 3-4 years now. He will take good care of you and take the time to explain your health, conditions, or recommendations. All heart related testings are done in the office too, which is super convenient. The staff are just as wonderful. They are very accommodating and will try to work with your schedule. I 10 out of 10 recommend Dr. Chane to be your Cardiologist!</Text>

I've been into the office only once, but I was impressed by the level of organization and careful attention given to me on my initial visit.  Gracious, efficient and complete. Everyone encouraged me, answered my questions, and went the extra mile to explain even with pictures.  It was much appreciated, after a heart attack that left me with more questions than answers.

Unfortunately, we didn't have the experience everyone talks about. I wonder if going to his office would have in any way been different? I waited all day, literally from 7am-6:30pm for him to stop by and see my dad only to have what I consider as the 2nd to worst experience with a specialty doctor.

<pics>None< /pics><name>Wilson Lim</name><Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I was referred to Dr. Chane in May 2017 for Venous Reflux Disease in both my legs. Dr. Chane and his team of expert staff are amazing. They were very accommodating and I was able to get an appointment very quickly. On my initial consult, the doctor had ordered vein ablation treatments, and the staff had already received authorization for my upcoming treatments. Excellent Service! Dr. Chane has since performed 4 vein ablation procedures, and I am feeling great. The pain and swelling has gone down tremendously, especially with the help of the compression stockings recommended by Dr. Chane. I can see great change in my legs, they are looking and feeling back to normal again. I want to thank Dr. Chane and his team for treating me like family. I would highly recommend Dr. Chane as a Cardiologist. He is GREAT!!<//Text></record>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I am an IMG (International Medical Graduate) from China planning to apply for a residency program in the US. I was looking for an elective and thankfully I was introduced to Dr Chane. I've spent one month on his office with him and his team,i t has been such a rewarding experience.

First of all, I felt so welcome and also I could join the team of medical assistants and perform patient encounters, EKGs, and scribing, which helped me be familiar with the medical system and practice the CS skills. Dr Chane has an enormous experience in the treatment of chronic
insufficiency and heart disease, which gave me a great opportunity to appreciate Dr Chane's expertise and improve my knowledge regarding Cardiology. Also, stuffs like Alexis and Trinh in office are friendly and helped me a lot, without them, I may not be able to join the team and do my job. It was a great experience and I sincerely recommend it for every IMG that needs friendly oppportunities to improve his/her clinical skills.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd26c7e7e7ca7d:0x6a7165136ed6a28b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. chane is a very attentive physician who goes above and beyond to ensure the full recovery of my wounds. My treatments were scheduled and completed in a timely manner. In addition to that, he is very clear and straightforward with his explanations and took all steps to make sure I was comfortable. His supporting staff was very welcoming and friendly.<//text>

< Review>
My experience at Dr. Chane's office was a great one! I came in with severe leg pain for months to the point that i couldn't even drive. I found Dr. Chane and he told me there was a cure called Vein Ablation treatments. They got me in right away and getting this problem taking care of. I got all my treatments within 4 weeks. i feel 85-90% better than i expected, a big improvement from when i first came in. The staff are wonderful and very helpful. I recommend if you have any issues with the veins to come and see Dr. Chane. Do not wait because it will only get worse!< /Review>

It has not only recovered the health to my legs but also, it will provide me with an overall better health condition. The staff in the office are really professional with all that they do.

I recently encountered Dr. Chane at the Huntington beach hospital after I was having a lot of shortness of breath. Dr. Chane was very skilled in the procedures he performed and probably saved my life. He was very open to answering any and all concerns that I had and I will definitely be coming back for check ups with him as my cardiologist. Great doctor and amazing person!<//Text>

<text>I arrived on time for a 9:00 follow up appointment with Dr Chane. No one else was waiting. At 9:15 Dr. Chane's assistant came in from the outside through the lobby.  At 9:30 I was called in.  The questions the nurse asked me clearly show they do not look at your chart or history, they are just going down a list and most questions are not even relevant to my situation.
At 9:45 Dr. Chane's assistant comes in and asks me why my blood pressure is a little higher than normal.  I told her I was upset for having to needlessly wait for 45 minutes. I asked whywas I booked for a 9:00 appointment when the staff wasn't even there?  She said she is just an employee and Dr. Chane wasn't even there at the time so if I had an issue I should take it up with him.  She told me that based on my test results they would need to resubmit to my insurance.  Why did they make me come in, charge me for an appointment, make me wait and then give me no useful information?  All this could have been done by phone or e-mail. I am a person, not a checklist and customer service matters.</text><gmap_id>0x80dd26c7e7e7ca7d:0x6a7165136ed6a28b< /gmap_id><name>Peter Brunner< /name><rate>2< /rate></record>

I am an IMG (International Medical Graduate) from Brazil planning to apply for a residency program in the US. I was looking for an externship and thankfully I was introduced to Dr Chane. I've spent one month on his office with him and his team. It has been such a rewarding experience. First of all, I felt so welcome and also I could join the team of medical assistants and perform patient encounters, EKGs, and stress tests. Dr Chane has an enormous experience in the treatment of chronic insufficiency and performs many procedures like vein ablation and phlebectomies, which were new for me. The best part for me was the discussion of patient's cases because it was a great opportunity to appreciate Dr Chane's expertise and improve my knowledge regarding Cardiology. It was a great experience and I sincerely recommend it for every IMG that needs friendly oppportunities to improve his/her clinical skills.<//Text>

They offer a great service and were able to help us very quickly. I didn’t need to wait for long and they were able to offer services in Spanish as well. I would certainly return again. The employee Gracia  is a great worker and she was very professional with me.<//review>

(Translated by Google) They have very good service, I have taken out 4 loans with them and they have given me better interest than other companies. Thanks to them I was able to open my taquizas business, and they also helped me to make credit and now thanks to them I was able to take out the dealer's troca for I already have good credit. I have recommended to family and friends and will continue to do so. Other companies reject people who don't have social security and they don't. Whether or not you have insurance or Itin, they can help you.

(Original)
Tienen muy buen servicio, yo e sacado 4 préstamos con ellos y me han dado mejor interés que otras companias.Gracias a ellos pude abrir mi negocio de taquizas, y también me ayudaron a hacer crédito y ahora gracias a ellos pude sacar troca del dealer por que ya tengo buen crédito. Yo e recomendado a familiares y amigos y lo seguiré haciendo. Otras compañías rechazan a la gente que no tiene seguro social y ellos no. Tengas o no tengas seguro o Itin, ellos te pueden ayudar.</Text>

< Review>
Ordered two pizzas online via delivery and arrived on time. Very delicious, the various ingredients balanced well with the sauces and spices on the pizzas we ordered. The cheese and crust were cooked to perfection. Very impressed overall with competitive pricing and various sizes to choose from. The only company that has wrapped the boxes in plastic to keep it warm and not spill - very much appreciated. Highly recommend this CA local company, hands down the best pizza our family has had.<//Review>

< review>
After years of walking buy Pizza Guys I finally got around to giving them a try.
I walked in and ordered a extra large California garlic chicken pizza, comes with a free liter of soda.
I was told it would take about 15 min. “ no worries I’ve got time, I walked next door a talked with Angie, the Happy Doughnuts owner” about 20 min later the pizza was ready and was handed to me. “ for an extra large it feels kind of lite, I said to my self” When I got home I opened the box and looked at the pizza for the first time. My initial impression was that it looks really good, I grabbed a slice and it folded over in all it’s soggyness. (1star) The taste? Solid 2.5 stars out of 5 “mediocre”  Value? 1 star, way over priced, I ate 3/4 of it by myself “keep in mind it’s an extra large” I can buy a large pizza from one of my favorite pizzerias for less and only eat 3 slices and the taste?, for-get-about-it! “If you know what I mean”
In all fairness, they do run a lot of special that brings the price point down but I paid the regular “way over priced” price. So unfortunately 2 Stars is all I could muster up for quality, flavor and overall value. Unfortunately I can not recommend them :C< /review>

Finally found a pizza place here which serves good pizzas. Bonus was the delivery guy was able to deliver without any issues. Otherwise everytime we have ordered and it takes ages for us to explain to the delivery guy how to come to our place.< /review>

<user_name>WillP<//user_name><date>1568767431911<//date><Rate>2< /Rate><review>The quality of the pizza gets a 4 star, however, the deceiveing practices get 1 star.

I walked into the store and told the guy at the counter that I had seen a special on-line two 2 topping pizzas for 13.99 each.

He tells me oh OK 2 medium.  I agreed with him since I did not have the online special in front of me.

By the time we got home I look at the online special again and it says "two 2 topping large pizzas for 13.99 each.

He could have corrected me and said oh yes is two large pizzas.

I'm sure they know the online specials for this area as they get a lot of orders/calls.

The owner or management tean needs to look into this kind of predatory sale practices.

Final note, I won't ever buy a pizza from this company.</review>< pics>

<Text>The food was unique and delicious! The service was equally as good. Very attentive the restaurant had a nice decor and friendly and nice staff. They have interesting combinations of asian fusion on their menu and I would definitely come back to try more. The cocktails were enjoyable. We spend a couple hours there. Tommy our host for the night was very polite and friendly. Hat's off to the chief. Definitely recommend this place to my friends.<//Text><gmapID>0x808e352b029df1bf:0x3edf30c48a6aea7b</gmapID>< time>

<Text>I placed an order for delivery. The initial pizza that arrived was wrong. I gave the store a call & they didnt hesitate to offer me a remake. I was initially upset but I LOVE PizzaGuys :) especially their California pizza with some add ons (tomatoes & jalapenos). They're pricey but worth it I swear!< /Text>< pics>

I first came across this pizza while out with friends . A group near us had this amazing smelling pizza and I knew I had to try it. Last night I ordered two pizza's one pepperoni and sausage the other simply pineapple . Along side the delicious pizza's I grabbed some garlic bread . The entire meal was delicious. Usually you get overly oily pizza due to the meats but it was balanced perfectly. I would order this over and over again. I feel I have found a new pizza place to call my own.< /Review>

I just visited a friend in san jose today, we decided to eat some pizza and watch movie together. We ordered Pizza Guys which we never have before. The delivery time was really fast and pizza was hot. The taste is way better than other places, their topping were really fresh and yummy. Great job guys.<//Review>

Ordered my pizza and pasta at least 70 mins ago and I have received nothing. Pizza shop is closed now, nobody is answering, I have no food and have to dispute the charges.

What a joke

**update**
We did receive our pizza and pasta. They were both cold, but, oddly enough, still pretty good. I assume if they arrived in a timely fashion and were still warm it would have been great.

Either way, I would probably order again with the hopes that the delivery time was a fluke. Moved one star to two.</Text>

BE CAREFUL IF YOU ORDER GLUTEN FREE!

We ordered a gluten free pie and a regular pie from Pizza Guys.  The delivery guy that came to my door was absolutely stoned.  He was so high, that my husband (normally a very relaxed man) came to the door to take over the transaction because the delivery dude was so out of it.  He was so completely stoned.

I opened up my son's Gluten Free pie and it looked EXACTLY like the crust of the regular pie.  So, I tasted them both and they tasted exactly the same.  I looked at the ticket and it did say Gluten Free but luckily my mom instinct had kicked in.

I called and the manager confirmed my suspicion- he said the GF crust looks completely flat and tastes very different...He sent another one over free of charge and allowed us to keep the wrong one.  He DID fix the problem nicely. AND he sent a more sober driver the second time, thank goodness.

HOWEVER, my son would have gotten VERY sick if he had eaten that pizza.  VERY VERY sick.  He would have been miserable with cramps, bloating, rashes and more for days.

Lastly, the pizza, like almost all pizza in the west, was terrible.  No better than freezer pizza.  It was better than Mountain Mike's though.< /text>

<review>Just good pizza.

I've only been here once, but I expect that I will go again (and update this review accordingly).

Pizza Guys makes good pizza.  They have several specialty pizzas, I got the Texas BBQ this time.  It wasn't greasy or too doughy or too spicy, but it hit the spot.

The deal that reeled me in was a small card on my front door, that is good for every order of a Large or Extra Large you can get another of the same  size or smaller for free.  Is is possible to get either a free 2-liter bottle of a soft drink or a free carton of Dreyer's Ice cream, but the deal doesn't pair with the Buy one Get one free deal (and it's only available for pickup).

Only odd thing I found was that although they advertise that Parmesan is available, the Online ordering does not list it as an option (as of 2016.06.07)

I will be visiting here again</review>< resp>

<userid>101354917679219490455<//userid><Review>Had a BOGO coupon so thought we'd try this place out. Ordered the Tuscan Garlic Chicken and the Garlic Lovers. The fresh tomatos on the GL was a really nice touch. The garlic white sauce was tangy and garlicky on both, but we thought it went better with the chicken on the TGL than the pepperoni on the GL. Overall, pretty good experience. But without the coupon, it's a little pricey.

Delivery was within 5-10 minutes of their estimate, which we appreciated considering our horrible experience with Patxi's.< /Review>< rate>

<review>We ordered 3 6"sandwiches on Saturday November 31 2020. The bread on all 3 sandwiches was horrible. It fell apart and tasted old. Don't think will ever return to this location. I should have taken back but I shouldn't have to. Quality should always be priority. I'm sure workers could tell that their bread was no up to standard. Wasted good money on horrible sandwich's. I should have called right away and kept receipt and demanded my money back. You will not get our business ever again</review>< resp>

Nice staff, great service and great food! Stayed in the area for vacation and work for two weeks. One of the girls knew my daily order exactly which made ordering quick and easy. And even though I always ordered a wrap with everything on it (except for onion haha), it was always rolled to perfection. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

Very clean. The girls here are always very friendly and accommodating.  As a regular customer one of the girls actually remembers my order and can get it started before I even open my mouth. They always ask about my day and try to converse a little with the customer to make it feel inviting. My point is this subway goes the extra mile.< /text>

<review>Over come back to try subway since jared is no longer autopay of this franchise i refused to support this business while they had a child molester as their spokesman. The bread haed tasted better now than before also but what they made a big mistake is in their pricing they we'rent from 5 dollars to 8 dollars and for that increase id rather spend my money else where.< /review>< username>

This is the friendliest Subway, it's not even close. The service is always quick and courteous. And of course​, they have sandwich​es just they way you want them.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I've been a customer of Bell Pest Control for many years to deal with ants and mice, and they've been very responsive. Recently there has been a real problem in Elk Grove with cockroaches that infiltrate homes from the sewers. I found several in my garage and called Bell for an additional service. It was almost time for my bimonthly service so the call center moved it up to the next day. I got a call from the technician, Matt, the evening I called and we arranged a more specific time for his visit, which was really helpful. When he arrived I described the problems with the sewer roaches and we had an interesting conversation about bugs. Matt sprayed around the property.  He also put down some rodent bait stations and gave me some tips to help keep the mousies at bay. All in all, a very helpful and pleasant interaction.</Text>< user>

<Text>I've been a Bell Pest Control customer for years. Four months ago I moved out of state. When I called to cancel and when someone reached out to me about an upcoming service - I was told that the cancellation must be done in writing, mail a letter. In the craze of two moves in the past four months I didn't send the letter, totally spaced. So today Bell called to collect on the service that they've been providing to a vacant house. My card on file wasn't working. I informed their employee that I moved and have a local bank. I just got something in the mail from them yesterday that I hadn't opened. As we talked, I opened a bill. I reiterated that I moved in July. The employee shared that there is no way that Bell could have known that I moved if I didn't submit that information in writing. I told her that I would make the payment but it's not accurate to say that Bell didn't know that I moved. If I've told two separate employees that I moved, I've made Bell aware. Saying that the contract requires that I make the request in writing is factual - I assume. I've been a customer for years and wouldn't begin to know where to find a contract - which is why I did not contest making the payment. However, insisting that because a letter was not received, there was no way to know is not factual. And insisting to reiterate that point made for a very poor customer service experience - for no reason, I already agreed to pay. I didn't contest the payment but shared that I was annoyed and would be sure to share that dissatisfaction. Never raised my voice, didn't even change tone. And from there the service experience went further downhill fast.

The most unbelievable part of the conversation? When I shared that I would pay the $154.00 reflected on my bill today and would follow up with a the late fees at a later date and was told that I can't demand not to pay. Wait, I have to ask permission to call back to pay the late fee? Who is the customer here. Again, didn't contest it, just said I would take care of the $154 reflected on my bill today and the balance at another time (I couldn't reconcile how a bill postmarked 10/23 with no late fees has now accrued two late fees. I figured it was better to see it on a bill.). I have never experienced such terse service from Bell. Until today, everyone whom I have ever worked with has been kind. Solicitors regularly approached with competing offers. I never even entertained a conversation about switching.

I will drop a letter in the mail reflecting my cancellation as I recognize that my phone call and this note do not constitute a cancellation. Guess we could draw further that this until that until the letter is received "Bell would have no way of knowing that I've moved.". Disappointing to see my loyalty to Bell hold so little value.< /Text></record>

Today 4/20 I had Rusty come over to take care of the pest control. He was phenomenal. Extremely friendly, very sweet, very attentive to my concerns and questions. Cares about my doggies and informed me how long to wait so the dogs don’t get fresh sprayed chemicals on them.
I love this company. Ever since they bought out the first company, they have been so sweet and very nice!
I’d highly recommend anyone to use this company for all pest control needs.
Thank you Rusty!<//text>

I love Bell Pest Control! I’ve been using BPC for over 5 years now and am very satisfied w the level of service they provide. Every employee I’ve talked to and or worked with has been very helpful and courteous. Most recently, Matt N. has come out to service my house. He was very knowledgeable and gave me a lot of pro tips to help mitigate possible summer critters. I feel they have my best interests in mind.</Text>

< Review>
We have been using Bell Pest Control for almost as long as we’ve lived in our home, which is almost 10 years. Being from Elk Grove, I love the idea of supporting a local, family run company. We have always had quality service over the years. We have had several different techs, and all have done great jobs. Jared is our tech now and he always  calls the day before he comes, checks in when he gets here to see if we’re having any issues and is always friend, courteous and professional. We have never had an issue with techs or office staff and have always been happy with their service. We would totally recommend them!<//Review>

I’ve been a long time customer of Bell’s Pest Control and remain a very satisfied customer. With a pool and new landscape out outdoor construction projects one would think the pest that are turned up in the disturbing of soil and by bringing new turf and soil for the new plants, that my property would be compromised and have an out of control pest problem. Because my service with Bell continues to address any concerns in advance and eliminating problems before they ever occur. I also appreciate the Technicians sent each time. Particularly I am pleased to compliment the customer service of Steve and Myles. They are beyond awesome. Kudos Bell!<//Text>

<Text>We have been with Bell Pest Control Service for 28 years, when we bought our home in Folsom, California, on the old Russell Ranch in the Broadstone development. From time to time we have encountered rats in our garage and ants in our house due to the wildlife in this area.
Jared has been our Technician for the past few years and has given us professional, courteous, reliable service.  The bimonthly maintenance service that Bell Pest Control offers is at a reasonable rate and has been very helpful.
We always get notified in advance before Jared, our Technician, comes.  It is also a plus that we have continuity with the same Technician providing service for our house.  He is in a position to take care of any pest problem that occurs with the best solution.  Last month when I called Bell Pest Control:  Jared came out the day we had an emergent need for service and with his expertise he provided immediate treatment and eradicated the problem!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I’ve been a customer since 1986. That says volumes about how I feel about this company. Matt Noel is my technician and he is thorough, courteous, considerate and knowledgeable. I know I’m lucky to have him looking after my needs! Job well done, Matt!</Text>

Highly recommended! My sister referred me to Bell b/c she’s been using them for many years. We hadn’t had a real problem with pests until more recently (unfortunately) and finally we had to call someone. We’re done with these darn mice, rats in our yard and I’m really looking forward to Bell serving our needs long term! I called and within an hour Steve and Rusty arrived. They happened to be in our area on another service which was perfect timing. Nancy who I think manages most of the calls was also awesome, very helpful and gave us an estimate right away.<//Review>

Matt does a great job for us. He’s spent some time explaining some of the chemicals used in the various seasons of the year. We asked him have you guys to some specific bugs. He was happy to oblige. We couldn’t be happier. Thanks Matt, Thanks Bell Pest Control.<//text>

I have had several technicians over the 16 years I've been with Bell Pest Control. They have all been professional and courteous. They've had no problem answering my questions and listening to my concerns. They've taken the time to handle any problems that we may have had which have been few and far between because the service has been so well.<//Review>

Brady is always very kind, friendly and incredibly professional. He calls with each service to ensure the timeline he will be delivering services works for us and is super flexible in the event something comes up. We always appreciate his friendly attitude and even goes the extra mile to deliver amazing customer service. Not to mention our home, both inside and out, are now insect free! After moving to a new construction home, we constantly had spiders everywhere. One call to Bell Pest and they took out concerns seriously and was able to send someone out the next day. We have been customers of Bell Pest for years and will continue to use their services for years to come because of great staff like Brady. If you’re considering using them, just do it! You won’t regret it one bit!</Text>

They came and they pulled out a Leviathan-sized rat from my ceiling!! My wife was extremely grateful which made me thankful.

<Text>Excellent customer service, friendly, and very professional. Osmond Soule was our tech and on his routine visit he introduced himself and asked if I had any questions/comments about the service. When I informed him I noticed a rodent in the garage, he immediately jumped into action. He was very knowledgeable, educated me on different things I can do to keep them from getting into the garage & house, and placed various traps that he checked on regularly until we caught one! If you’re looking for a pest control service that produces results, look no further, I highly recommend Bell Pest Control!<//Text><Rating>5</Rating><Gmap_id>0x809ab8b16337009f:0x55e2bbad5666f4ef</Gmap_id>< Response>

Matt Noel was extremely responsive and came within an hour and a half of my calling looking for assistance. He educated us on our problem and offered additional services if needed. Kudos to him and all of you at Bell Pest. You are lucky to have him!<//Text>

We started using bell pest a few months ago because we started seeing black windows and silver fish around our house. They came right away, did an awesome job and we haven’t had any problems since! We have them come every other month and they continue to do a great job. Dru was super friendly and made sure to check in with us for any questions or concerns. We would definitely recommend their services!< /Text>

I have been a customer for almost 8 years on their every other month service plan. They are always on time, courteous, and thorough. Every time I’ve requested an off month visit or a repeat visit they have scheduled those timely and with the plan they are free of charge.

Steve is my current technician and I appreciate his professionalism and friendly demeanor. And also that instead of doing just bare minimum he always takes the time to check in and recommend additional useful areas that he can treat.

Extremely happy customer!</Text>

Help!!! I saw a roach! It was in my garage.  What if they break in!  Oh no Ceonita we are on our way!  The roaches run rampant in the summer and I find them disgusting.   I should not have roaches..I'm too clean... "They are field roaches" a calming voice chimes back.  I am immediately eased as I know the very next morning Darrell will come and save my sanctuary.  DING DONG  Darrell is at my door cheerful and ready to handle business.  He explains to me that it will all be okay and notices a spider web on my porch.  Swish..it's gone.  Snail trail accross the porch. BOOM havn't seen one since Bell runs their regular service.  They are affordable, efficient friendly and kind.  I have had Bell for YEARS.  My first tech Kelly was amazing too !  I think they only hire the best people.</Text>

I've been using Bell Pest Control since August 2020 and they are fabulous! They are timely and a real person answers the phone. Regular service, performed by Dru, is on time and done thoroughly. When we had a bee hive show up in between services, Dru was able to come out same day. Highly recommend!

Update - another wasp next was found and I called Bell in between services and they came out within 48 hours. Steve and Rodney did a fabulous job checking all eves for wasp nests as well as preventative spraying. They arrived within allotted window, were friendly and professional. So glad to have them!<//Review>

We have a rat problem because of our proximity to the Sacramento River. Our Schnauzer could hear them in the crawl space this morning so we called Bell Pest.  Within 3 hours, Steve, Matt, and Myles were here helping me locate (again) even more entry spots.  They also checked the traps and generally spent over an hour working with me to hopefully minimize (or eliminate) our problem.  Thank-you for your service!  Bill McGrath</Review>

Matt came out on time, and answered all my questions (like why my own pest control plans hadn't worked) and offered multiple solutions to address my minor ant issues.
He quickly found the source of the ants, and applied a new bait that immediately got the ants attention.
I'm a very satisfied customer!< /text>

< Review>
We have a rat problem because of our proximity to the Sacramento River. Our Schnauzer could hear them in the crawl space this morning so we called Bell Pest.  Within 3 hours, Steve, Matt, and Myles were here helping me locate (again) even more entry spots.  They also checked the traps and generally spent over an hour working with me to hopefully minimize (or eliminate) our problem.  Thank-you for your service!  Bill McGrath< /Review>

Matthew came and serviced our house today.  I can never keep track of when they are due to come out, but I don’t have to! They always give me a “heads-up” e-mail the day before. Bell Pest control is great.  They are affordable, polite, professional and don’t mind my crazy dog.< /text>

<Review>Steve has been a huge help. He saved the day we had a little visitor that need to be evicted and was done in just a couple of days. We had a big problem with spider webs and he also took care of that too. He always calls the day before to check what time to stop by. He is always very friendly and happy. He is a great representative of Bell Pest Control.<//Review>< Pics>

My parents had Bell Pest for years so when I had a problem with ants I called them for service. Matthew is my technician and he is great, he was able to come to my house the same day I called. I no longer have any ants in sight and I couldn’t be more happy with the service they provide. Would definitely recommend Bell Pest to anyone looking for a pest service.</Text>

<review>Dru serviced my house and was great! I had mice get into my garage and he helped locate where they were coming in and suggested options to block the entry point. He set up a bait box as well. Inside the house he helped locate where pincher bugs were coming from and sprayed for them as well.
Dru is very professional and helpful!

Cole our service tech is wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable.  He responds well to my request for extra attention.  And he does a thorough job.  He performs his duties like he likes his job!  I find that attitude unusual for California.<//Review>

< review>
I’ve used Bell Pest Control for several years now at my personal residence and have had nothing but good experiences. Today, Steve and Ryan from Bell Pest came out today to address a rodent problem. They, like all other Bell Pest employees I’ve encountered, were professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. I highly recommend.<//review>

<text>Am really happy that I chose Bell Pest Control to take care of my problem with rodents.  It is really nice to be able to talk to a live person when you call.  Steve Ede has been to my house three times and has been wonderful..  He has been on time, and I feel very comfortable that he is doing everything to help keep rodents from my house.  I called at 8:00 a.m. today because the day before my house was full of flies and most of them in the laundry room where the opening for the attic is.  Steve came out.   No dead rodent but he did spray for flies.  Showed him where all of a sudden there were lots of ants and he put some chemical down.  I am really happy with the service that I am receiving from Bell Pest.< /text>< Pics>

We have been customers for over 5 years.
Tech Jered arrived exactly on time as scheduled.
Very thorough, polite and made sure that he explained what he is about to do and why.
Very professional. Always wore protective shoe covers while inside the house.
Offered to come back if additional help or attention is needed to resolve any additional issues.
Stated that this service is guaranteed for 60 days.
For this I will give Bell Pest Control and tech Jered a 5 star rating!

I don’t like having to stick around all day or be given a huge time window, so specific appointment times are greatly appreciated. Furthermore, my regular tech is Dru. He’s very professional, always puts covers on his shoes while indoors, and confirms that he’s addressed all of my issues.<//Review>< pics>

I have had Bell Pest Control Service since I purchased my first home in 2014. I recently purchased a new home in February and within the first month I had a large ant infestation in my home after an ant nest was disturbed following yard work that was done before I purchased the home. I haven't had to do any work in the yard yet, so it wasn't me:-) I called the office first thing in the morning hoping someone could come that day before the ants made it into my pantry. I wish I could remember the name of who I spoke with. She was absolutely lovely, sympathetic and went above and beyond to get techs to my house that afternoon. If I recall, she mentioned that she lives in Galt, I hope that helps her supervisor identify her.
Osmand and Isiah arrived that afternoon to spray inside and out, inspected my attic to make sure there were no rodents (as the home inspection noted some old droppings up there) and they inspected the backyard to see where the ants were coming from. Sure enough, Isiah was able to identify the source and followed the ant trail clear across my backyard to my fruit trees. They treated the area and walked me through everything they did before leaving. We set up a follow-up appointment for Osmand to return two-weeks later to check on the bait he placed in the attic and check on the ant situation.
At our follow-up appointment I informed Osmand that I thought there may be a dead rodent in my wall and I had been smelling it since the day I moved in, he also smelt it. He went straight to the attic, checked the old bait and placed an odor absorption bag in my attic to help with the odor as he couldn't find the animal. OMG it has only been an hour and the smell is already improving. He treated the backyard again as there was still a decent ant trail moving along my patio, but luckily no more ants in the house!! WOOHOO
In my opinion, Bell Pest Control is great. I have always lucked out getting truly amazing techs that seem to go above and beyond. They are always so professional, personable and genuine.
Thank You

We've used Bell Pest Control since we moved here 8 years ago.  Steve is our guy! He does an amazing and thorough job! I usually wait until Steve comes, and then I ambush him with any issues or problems. He never makes me feel like he's in a rush. He goes out of his way to really listen to what I'm saying and even spent 30 minutes walking around my house this week - and then walking around it with me to show me any places along our roofline that he thought might be suspicious for possible rodent entry. He explained their Exclusion service thoroughly and offered to put us on the list. He's an awesome guy - and we appreciate him, the great job he does and his time. I highly recommend Steve & Bell Pest Control!< /text>

<review>We have used this service for a few years.  When we moved to a different house in Elk Grove earlier this year, we moved our service right along with us.  Darel is our current "bug guy" and he's very responsive to our needs in the new home.  He's friendly and does a thorough job.  They come back if you have repeat offenders and there are no extra charges. We've had no issues and would recommend this company to anyone looking for reliable and responsive service.<//review></record></dataset><record>

We've been using them to help  fight some ants and a rat problem in the area. Steve came and stopped our ants and now has helped us work on trapping ants. He is very knowledgeable about what he does and passionate.  He explained everything thoroughly and we enjoy having the service. Highly recommend< /Review>

<Review>I have been a Bell Pest Control customer for several years. They come to my home on-time monthly to provide services, ensuring that the perimeter of my home is regularly treated to keep bugs, spiders, and rodents away. Bell Pest Control’s regular attention makes my home and garage a nicer place to spend time. Thank you to Leon and the handful of other talented and dedicated service technicians from Bell that have assisted me with maintaining my property over the years.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I have had this service for over ten years. Recently I was having a cockroach problem, and I was having issues with getting help from the secretary. Steve Ede called me at the same time for my scheduled service, and I discussed what was happening. I am handicapped and could not comply with the pre visit demands of the secretary. Steve came out, did the scheduled service outside .......then came in and addressed my indoor issue on his own. this employee was motivated on his own to overcome and correct my secretary issues. good job Steve !</text>

Jared is a great guy. Not only does he do a thorough job of spraying for pests,  sweeping cobwebs,  and making an extra stop by if we get ants,  but he also is great with our dogs.  They know that he'll take a few minutes out of his schedule to give them  attention.  We are grateful for all he does.</review>

<review>We just started our service at our new home. Osmand was amazing. He helped us setup the service and walked us through everything. In the same day he did an inspection and started spraying.

Great service with great people. Really appreciated the help Osmand provided.</review>< pics>

< review>
We've been a customer since purchasing our new home almost 5 years ago and have had Bell Pest Control manage our servicing needs the entire time. We've been extremely grateful for their service, professionalism, care, and true understanding of our unwanted pest needs. Isaiah is our current representative and he is just great to work with! He makes sure he asks if we have any specific needs or worries each and every time he comes out to service, calls the day before to notify us that he's coming, and doesn't leave until he has taken care of every need/concern. He doesn't hesitate to encourage us to call in between visits if anything comes up that needs attention, and always provides service with a smile and a friendly disposition. The office is also great at always providing prompt service any time we call with any special needs and never makes us feel uncomfortable for doing so. "Thank you" Bell Pest Control!</review>

<Review>Steve has been great! He always asks us before he starts if there is anything that has cropped up since his last visit so he can address it. He also follows up on problems we have had with pests in past! Super friendly!</Review>< pictures>

This summer I started seeing roaches outside my house.  Worried they may eventually come in I got this service.  Jared does a great job.  He is very professional.  Always checks in before he starts spraying and asks if there are any concerns.  I am so glad I chose this company. I haven't seen  roaches in months.</review>

<Review>Cody from Bell Pest control has been out to the house twice, and both experiences were excellent. We had a terrible ant and spider problem until we called them. After their first visit, where Cody sprayed inside and out(we had to leave for 45 mins to let the spray dry) , the big issues were gone within a day or two. Cody has been very helpful, and took the time to ask me questions about various places in my home that I might need sprayed. I felt like he truly wanted my business and was sincerely interested in destroying my bug problem. Good guy, and the spray worked. He also told me I could call anytime if something came up, free of charge. Great company, we finally found good pest control...anybody with kids and a wife that hate bugs knows how happy I am.</Review><GmapID>0x809ab8b16337009f:0x55e2bbad5666f4ef< /GmapID>< Rating>

We’ve been using Bell pest for a few months now and I highly recommend them. Jered T is our technician and he is very thorough, Professional and takes time to answer any question and address any concerns. We recommended them to my mother in law who is also extremely happy with their service as well. I don’t know why we waited so long to sign up with them! If you get Jered as your tech you’ll be in great hands!</Text>

I have been with Bell Pest Control for close to 12 years now. My technician Kevin has been by far the best technician I have had so far. I hope he stays on my route for many years.  He is very professional, friendly and always punctual. He is always willing to come back at my convenience if any new pest issues arise in between my scheduled visits. Which hasn’t been necessary yet. As I said at the beginning of my review great employees are a must to have a great company. Kevin helps make this company great. He is what helps this company get 5 star reviews. The company and Kevin deserve more then 5 stars. Thank you for the great service.<//Review>< pics>

Technician Jared thoroughly inspects our property for problem areas during his routine visits.  Always friendly, Jared makes sure we understand what actions he is taking.  On rare occasions when we get an "ant invasion" he returns within a day to correct the problem.  Thanks Jared!</review>

I explained that I am 8 months pregnant and having surgery in a few weeks. My house was completely overrun with ants and I could do nothing to stop them. Within minutes of speaking with Briana she had found a technician (Matt) that was able to come out that very same day. Both Matt and Briana went above and beyond to make sure that I was informed, and safe through all steps of the process. Thank you to everyone at Bell Pest Control for you excellent customer service and teamwork.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

We found a couple of outdoor cockroaches appear earlier this year for the first time, despite having a very clean yard. We didn't want it to become an infestation so I researched for the best pest control company for our area and selected Bell Pest Control for our targeted pest management. Jered is our regular technician and quickly resolved the issue. I am a proponent of integrated pest management and wanted to understand what would be applied around our home. Jered explained how these pests are growing in the area over the past several years and the safe chemical application to keep them away. Since the very first application we've not seen any more of those bad bugs, not to mention the occasional black widow spider that show up in our backyard. Jered always calls us the day before to confirm our appointment, and he rings the door upon arrival and checks on status and if any issues. He's always polite and professional. We are very happy with our service from Bell!<//Review>

<Review>I have been a satisfied customer of Bell Pest Control for nearly 20 years. Each technician that has serviced my home has been knowledgeable and professional. My current assigned technician is Steve who continues this 5 star service. Over the course of my time with Bell, they have been prompt in responding to any special issues. Steve also calls in advance of my preventive service to let me know when he is coming and asks if there are any specific issues that need  to be addressed. I am extremely happy with the service provided by Bell.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The manager, Myles, was so helpful during our initial consultation. He took his time to thoroughly do a perimeter check, paying special attention to the areas that I had some concerns with. I asked him many questions about how to better defend our property against unwanted guests, and he was not stingy on the information! I thought that seeing as how he worked with the pest control company, he wouldn't want to "lose business", but he really had a people-first mentality.

The value of their services are great, with very reasonable prices- less than $50 a month for peace of mind! I wouldn't think twice about signing up with Bell, even if as a form of assurance.

Thanks, Myles!< /text>

<Text>I have been a client of Bell Pest Control for over 3 years and I have high regard for the service they provide me. I have been so impressed with the quality of service that Bell Pest Control delivers, that I refered my neighbor to Bell Pest Control and they too, are now clients as well.
Isiah and Matt have been our technicians and have always been extremely professional, thorough and courteous, always willing to
extend the extra effort to treat outdoor areas where needed.

<Review>Isaiah our Bell Pest Control Technician is always on time and professional.  We have had ants at our house recently, and he is always good about giving us the options available and what he recommends.  We have a baby in the home, so he is very attentive to that and not doing anything that our baby would be able to get into.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1589471580726, 'text': 'Elizabeth, thank you for sharing what your experience has been with the company as well as your Technician Isaiah - Bell Pest Control'}<//Response>< gmapID>

<name>ed grohosky jr</name><Date>1583868150542</Date><rating>5</rating><Review>have had Bell pest for years. currently Steve is knocking home runs in servicing my house. I do have home security cameras, so I am able to watch just exactly how my home is serviced. previous Bell employees have all done great work here, and they go out of their way to move my pets food and water when they spray. they always call and confirm prior to service, and always inquire if there are any problems. years back, I did have a flea problem inside the house. Bell Pest made three trips out until I was happy with the eradication. the first thing is see is a smile when they arrive, and a smile and a handshake when they leave.</Review>< Pics>

Bell Pest Control has always taken such good care of us. Brady comes to the house to spray, sweep eves, and inspect. When he finds issues, he alerts me and offers to provide a quote. I feel safe knowing he keeps the creepy things away and watches over our house.</text>

<Review>Bell Pest Control has always taken such good care of us. Brady comes to the house to spray, sweep eves, and inspect. When he finds issues, he alerts me and offers to provide a quote. I feel safe knowing he keeps the creepy things away and watches over our house.</Review><rate>5</rate><UserId.>104182322649993011960< /UserId.>< user_name>

<review>Just had a door sweep installed and attic insulation replaced.  Shout out to Brady who recommended the door sweep to keep rodents out of the garage.  Shout out to Myles who not only installed the door sweep, but arranged for the attic insulation replacement.  Myles coordinated the insulation job with ALCAL and they did a great job!

Steve was prompt, friendly and courteous, professional, and asked about any special issues currently. All of Bell Pest Control's staff have been reliable and caring. Glad that Steve is carrying on that character.

They will only spray your whole exterior if you follow them around and tell them exactly what to do. If you want the inside sprayed their technicians show up and will try to talk you out of it . They would rather hire family instead of qualified hard workers. I’ve had them almost 2 years. There product works good and that’s why I’ve stayed but I’ve had a problem 8 times out of 10 and needed them to come redo their pest service again. And I would follow them around tell them exactly where to spray and what to do. They won’t even knock on your door to let you know they are here or when they leave. They spray random spots and leave . So unless you want to hire a pest company that needs assistance and a person to follow them around I would not trust they do the job good when you’re not looking, because they don’t ... Two years is enough of them. I’m canceling as of today . I recommend to stay away from them. Basically hire at your own risk.its been 2 months now after we canceled and just got a bill with a late fee for $89.00 due .. just wow.< /Review>< gmap_id>

He is professional and considerate and actually listens to the customers. I would give him more stars if possible. Brady does a complete job each time and always has a smile on his face.

Steve is now our pest guy since Brady got promoted (way to go Brady!) and he does a fabulous job! I am so impressed by his positive attitude and willingness to come back for special black widow treatments if needed. Thank you Steve!

Brady ALWAYS goes above and beyond. We are so lucky to have him as our pest guy. He always has a smile on his face and a "no problem" attitude.< /review>

I give Steve at Bell Pest a 5 star highest rating with no hesitation! Steve is always a pleasure to do business with. He is funny and always cheerful. :) He arrives regularly without fail, leaving a message the day before so I know he's coming. And when I find a pest carcass on my property, Steve happily makes an extra trip over to take care of it for me with just a phone call. GREATLY Appreciated! :)< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Andrew A. is awesome.  He is fast, patient, on time, and honest.  We had a serious ant problem at our new home and call him almost every couple of weeks.  Every time he would eliminate the ants from one area of the home, they showed up in another area.  Every time we called him, he returned our call immediately and came out within the next 24 hours to take care of the ants.  When the ants seemed to persist after a few treatments, he even brought out his boss to check it out.  Eventually Andrew was able to locate the ant colonies we had in our yard and took care of it.  He even talked to our neighbors when he discovered that they had an ant colony in their yard that was traveling over to ours.  With a newborn in the house Andrew was sensitive to our concerns and always worked with us to make sure that we were out of the house or on a completely different level if we had to stay home.  All this for no extra charge.  We would definitely recommend Andrew.<//Review>< Pics>

Brady is a true professional! He always spends the appropriate amount of time around our house. If we have a concern he addresses it and explained what he is doing. He has never damagedid anything around the house as other pest control companies have done. Great job to Bell Bros and Brady K</Review>

<Review>Kellie, our Technician, is not only people friendly, but goes out of her way to insure the comfort of the homeowner. When we had rodent issues in our new home she acted with expediency and understanding. She listens to your concerns, offers suggestions to situations, and then follows through. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</Review><Rating>5</Rating><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

Vahan was very personable and professional while cleaning our carpet.  All of our high traffic areas had the stains completely removed and the carpet looked remarkable when finished.  Very happy with the results and our selection of company (we contacted about 3-4 other local organizations before making our final selection).  Thanks for the hard work you did!</Review>

<Text>I have had Bell Pest Control for a long time and have always had good service.  Andrew A. was my technician this time and he did a FANTASTIC job.  He was unable to complete my service originally because I had left the back gate locked.  He adjusted his schedule to work with mine with no questions asked and came back to finish it up.  He was on time, right when he said he'd be there and explained everything he was using and why. He answered all my questions without making me feel rushed and even gave me some great tips on how to keep rodents away from the house.  Andrew was great to talk with and all in all it was a great experience.  Thanks Bell for always giving great service and thanks Andrew A. for upping the bar and exceeding my expectations!!!<//Text>< rating>

I had the guy come back out for some more spiders. The Techs name was Josh, he listened very well we made a plan and he went to town around the yard. He was very professional. People with that kind of integrity is why I still do business with Bell Pest Control. I was very satisfied with the Techs work plus he is one of the only techs that makes sure the gates are shut when the jobs done.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>About 3 weeks ago I had Bell service my home for ants.  They did a great job however, weeks later I discovered a few ants in my laundry room.  Today, Andrew A. came to service my home and did an excellent job!  Not only did he take care of the laundry room he did the garage and the outside of my home again.  While outside he noticed a trail of ants leading to my porch. He took the time to locate the ant colony  instead of just spraying the trail.  Additionally, while in my back yard he found another colony and took care of it as well.

Andrew is very friendly, was on time, and did his best to meet and exceed my expectations!  He was very thorough and went above and beyond to ensure I was completely satisfied.

Too bad he doesn't regularly service my area.
Thank you Andrew for going above and beyond and getting rid of my ant problem!< /text>< Pictures>

I have been a Bell Pest customer for over 10 years, my technician Joe Buono is very knowledgeable! he is thorough and has always provided great customer service. As a result, I use Bell Pest at two properties and they have always been responsive to any concerns that I have. I highly recommend them for any pest control or maintenance needs you may have.</text>

My husband and I would like to thank Bell Pest Control for sending Dennis as our technician.  He took the time to listen to what we expected from him and the company he represents.  He explained everything and answered all our questions regarding service, the chemicals used and exactly where they would be applied.  He explained the contract in detail and answered the questions we had.  We look forward to working with him and know he will continue to offer the service we expect. Very professional young man.
Thanks Dennis - you're a 10 in our book.< /Review>

I am very pleased with the service provided by Bell Pest and techician, Kellie. Due to Kellie's promptness, expert knowledge, and professional-personable mannerism, I soon felt confident that she would eliminate the rodent problem in my garage. She's done a good job, because we haven't seen signs of the pests for weeks. Promote Kellie to the next level!</Text>

Dennis is and has been my tech for a good bit of time. He always asks about my concerns and  makes recommendations and just does a great job for me. I think it is important that Bell pest knows what an asset he is to the Company. I have never had any problems with any Bell pest employees but Dennis is above and beyond.< /review>

I am a new Bell Pest Control customer. I met with Myles for the first time this morning. He explained everything so perfectly, listened to our needs and concerns. More important, he took the time to explain several aspects of pest control and the many services he can provide. I have been with a couple of other pest control companies but they didn't meet our needs. I believe we have finally found the right match. Thank you Myles for your time and professional service this morning!< /Review>

<Name>Allison Trestor</Name><Text>We had Andrew from Bell Pest Control out about a month ago and it has completely changed the way we can use our yard. No more bites on our ankles when we walk in the lawn, no more ants crawling on everything, no more wasps. It's fantastic!

I was concerned about the use of chemicals in my yard (we have a 2 year old), but Andrew sat down and explained everything to me, he showed me where I can go online and find information about the products they use, he didn't rush me. He spent time answering all my questions, and as a result, calmed my fears.

I can't recommend Bell higher than 5 stars, but I wish I could. They're great, and we love Andrew!  Thank you so much.</Text>< Date>

< Review>
Worst experience ever!  Make sure you read the fine print if you sign a contract or they will most likely try to extort additional months. I paid for my 12 months of service and tried to cancel but they said they required 30 days written notice. Then they doubled it by adding extra charges and fees. I regretted signing up for 1 year but fulfilled my obligation only to have them pull something like this. I'm puzzled that they would think this is a good way to do business.<//Review>

Great service since 2012!  In a couple of situations Joe, the the technician who always comes out, has been able to do a service call within 24 hours of me calling.  He knows my home well and what I like to have done.< /review>

andrew A. is always kind enough to call the day before to set up a time to come do the servicing to our home and yard.  He always arrives on time, and asks if we have any specific problems he needs to address.  Then he does thorough job.  Thank you Andrew!< /review>

<Date>1473353506176< /Date><name>Shayne H< /name><text>Typical racquet they make tons of promises, don't deliver and then try and charge you a cancellation fee for cancelling service. Ask yourself this, does any other trade (HVAC, Electric, Plumber) charge you a fee to cancel service?  You don't have any product of theirs that they need to cover cost on or any other reason to have a fee to cancel service. The reason they have the fee is because they know people will cancel when they can't deliver as promised. Good luck if you use this company....< /text></record></dataset><record>

Over the past year we have used Bell Pest Control and Carpet Cleaning services twice and have been extremely happy with the service.  Vahan is easy to visit with and high conscientious of his work and it shows.

Highly recommend Bell and Vahan.</Review>

<Text>First off I would like to say this has got to be the worst customer services experience I've had with any company. Every time I calls I have to speak with someone name Nancy. She has always had a nasty attitude. I've been with this company for over 7 years and always pay for my services on time. She stated that I basically had my service for free. If I had my service for free I would like all the 7years for payment return to me. I work hard for my money and I don't get anything for free. I have statements to prove that I pay all my services on time. I don't appreciate someone telling me I get my stuff for free when I'm paying for it. She made it like they didn’t need my services. She told me that I would not find any one better than them. It’s not me losing, it’s them losing a customer and their reputation. Please read the fine prints before signing anything. People you may want to think twice before signing.</Text>< pictures>

I just had Stewart from Bell Carpet Cleaning do all the carpets in my house.  He was very professional, extremely detail oriented and careful with my home.  He used corner guards to make sure his hoses didn't ding up my walls, he mopped up any overspray that was caught on my hardwood floors, he pointed out any small spots he was seeing and made sure he got them all out.  His equipment appeared to be top notch.  He pre-sprayed everything, used his rotating suction equipment to scrub the carpets, he handled two sets of stairs with heavy traffic patterns like a pro, and he brought my living room carpet back to life...even the spot in front of the fire where the dog sleeps!  Excellent job, I will absolutely have him back again!</Text>

<Review>We used Bell when we first moved to California two and a half years ago, and were very pleased with the prompt and excellent service, from the person that answered the phone (Heather) to the technician who serviced our rentsl (Gary). When we finally bought a home, we wanted Bell to be our pest control company again. The whole staff at Bell have been very friendly and professional, and never any hassale if they have to come back out. There main goal seems to be customer service, and they excell at that.

I have had Bell pest controll for 5 years. I love the work they do, but because of the hard money times I needed to cancel. The girl in the office talked me into every three months. I thought about it and called back a week later to cancel. She said you have to do it in writing. This is in February 2012. So I type a letter of cancellation and sent it. In May to my surprise I get a bill. I called and I told her I sent you a cancellation letter. She says we never got it. I found my copy and called back she said just because I sent it, it doesn't mean we recieved it. She wouldn't take care of the bill. For $95 it cost them a bad review and no referral from me. NOT GOOD customer satisfaction. I wonder if the owner's ever read these.<//text>

Extremely disappointed with our experience in discontinuing our services with Bell Pest Control due to moving out of the property. We are CONTINUING to be charged for services at that property despite following all the proper channels, i.e. written notification requesting cancellation of service, verbal notification on NUMEROUS occasions AND notifying our service person, Steve (who was always great, btw...too bad they don't hire his degree of honesty & integrity in the office), that we had cancelled the services. We ultimately had to file a fraudulant charge claim with our bank against Bell Pest Control in order to rectify the situation, get the charges reversed and prevent them from posting additional charges to our account. **We were treated extremely rudely by their staff members and were basically told "too bad" when they were unable to 'find' our paperwork.

Think twice before using them...do you want to be charged for services not rendered and continue to pay for those services even after you've vacated the property? We'll be making a report to the BBB, as well as informing everyone we know of our experience.

It appears, from the other reviews here, that this is a pattern with Bell Pest Control. Do your homework before signing up...shady business practices do not make for happy customers, nor long-term customers!

the exterior of our house was littered with black widows in the beginning of the summer and our property management company sent out bell pest control. Christine has come out twice now and has been extremely professional, she seems very knowledgeable and is very respectful of my home, she even took her shoes off before she came in after seeing all of our shoes by the front door (without me even mentioning it by the way) i noticed tons of dead widows outside after the first week and havent seen one since. i just mentioned that we were having ant problems and she exceeded my expectations in that department as well. she even took care not so spray around our citrus tree and was very understanding when i told her that i dont want to spray anything inside the home because of our 3 kids. it has only been a day and so far there has been a dramatic decrease in ants in our home (fingers crossed) she also made it a point to let me know that if we had any issues to just call and she would come out (a relief after ive spent about $100 in traps and poison in the last year attempting to get rid of these ants). I've already recommended her specifically to a close friend and my in-laws. although im not footing the bill, if i owned my own home i wouldnt hesitate to request her service.</Text>

<Review>Hello,

I would like to write a review to Bell Pest Control that this morning on 6/3/21, Rusty provided me with an unbelievable service.

He was very polite, attentive and performed the service throughly to the areas of the house. I’ve noticed spiders and roaches in my garage and practically around the house.

My experience with Rusty was very positive and professional and he really made my day.

Bell pest Control has a great asset in their company.

Thank you,
Cesar<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>
