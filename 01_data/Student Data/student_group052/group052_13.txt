I’ve used many storage locations, and this location managed by Vanessa and Sue has proven to be the best service above and beyond any storage facility in town and better than other states. Vanessa has saved me from multiple problems. She knows what to do and is so quick to respond, she’s way ahead solving any issue I have come to her with. I see Sue and Vanessa busy cleaning and taking care of business details everyday I’m there. They are cheerful, quick and thorough. Seriously there’s no cleaner storage unit anywhere. The place is sparkling and smells super clean every time I’m there it’s pristine. Thank you for all the help, for the cheerful smiles and greetings. They raised the bar on customer service. You won’t find better. The prices seem reasonable compared to other storage facilities. I choose Extra Space Storage for the best storage. I can find better prices elsewhere, but it’ll never be as good security, access, quality of units, cleanliness and super customer service. The best!!!!!< /review>

Very friendly and attentive employees. Very easy process to open my account and competitive pricing. The unit area and units themselves are very clean. My only complaint is that I have to get out of my car to enter my numbers upon departure. I definitely recommend Extra Space Storage!<//Text>

<review>Worked with Sue. She was very friendly and kind. This is a clean and newer building and absolutely love the security. Gate codes are long but definitely give me peace of mind. Good sizing and spacing. Carts are free to use. Good access to the second and third floor. Elevators are spacious. Recommend.< /review>< Pictures>

I cannot thank Vanessa (at Thousand Oaks CA storage site) enough for her help. Along with her TM, she helped me with what would have been a no-win experience with my Moving cube company.
Having to start over from the beginning at a new life is incredibly stressful. My entire life is in that cube. Vanessa understood and that is priceless to me.< /review>

Super clean, great sense of security, amazing staff that help you out if you need (even call you back ASAP if you leave them a message). A hair bit expensive but, I’m still happy with the service I got when I needed it the most! Lots of parking, carts and decent available times to enter the unit.

<Review>Edit 1/28/21
It’s move in the truck is here, and my unit keys were in a different car. Sue and Vanessa were ready to help and the process was quick and painless. I had 2 locks on and Vanessa went to work immediately to remove the locks. It wasn’t more than 10 minutes and my unit was open. Obviously last time was a fluke or miscommunication, as always the facility is pristine.

I was asked to write a google review and the agent said they had monthly quotas to solicit customers to post reviews. I called and the manager urged me to sign the lease without coming in "we don't do anything in the office" is what Vanessa said. So, feeling uncomfortable about not seeing the unit, I reviewed the lease. Sue had offered me insurance the day before at the tentative value and said for 10k worth of items, the insurance would be $44 a month. This is 4x more than my renter's insurance. I called and asked Vanessa if I can change the value of my items after tallying my receipts. She said that "Well you declared that your items were worth this much when you spoke to Sue so...". She said I would have to cancel. I ended up cancelling and losing my security deposit. At no time did Vanessa attempt to keep me as a customer. She was completely careless and said "Ok then bye". For an area manager who has great customer service skills (supposedly), I was shocked at the experience I had. Funny enough, last year I was storing at this facility and had a wonderful experience with Sue. It seems that Sue is great and Vanessa is not. Sue is awesome and regardless of experience the facility is top notch</Review>< pics>

Needed a place to store my stuff on a short term basis. The whole process was seamless and the facility is newer and very clean.
After moving to a new city, I cleared out my storage and let them know I had vacated. The process was swift and easy, highly recommend this facility.</text>

Very clean facility and secure as well. The only issue I had with Extra Space Storage over the nearly 2 years I was there was several billing issues. However since this is a fault of Extra Space billing and not the facility, I still rate the facility 5 stars.< /Text>

Vanessa and Sue are the best!! I've dealt with a few managers at (the enemies) I mean the competitors storage & the difference is night & day. Extra Space actually makes you feel like they want you as a customer. As for the competitor, let's just say that they should learn how to deal with the PUBLIC!!!<//text>

My Fiancée and I were in the process of moving and Vanessa and Sue assisted me as I got a 10x10 storage unit, later I realized it wasn’t enough but I made it work. The next day I spoke with Sue on the phone and asked for a bigger unit and said she would reserve it and come on by. As I got there I ran into Vanessa and I asked her for the 10x15 that she recommended yesterday and was closer to the door so it was easier to load more of the unit. Thank you Sue and Vanessa for assisting me with amazing customer service and making my move and life that much easier. Extra Storage is lucky to have you guys as employees!!!!</Review>

The ExtraSpace Storage in Thousand Oaks is absolutely amazing. The facilities are spotless and very clean. It is never crowded and the way the facility is set up makes moving items to your units very easy. Sue the Assistant Store Manager is fabulous! She is so kind, and on top of her game. We had a delivery of large packages and my car was already full, she was so kind to stop what she was doing and help us move our shipment into our locker. She even comes by the units and checks on us to see if we need anything. Sue is amazing!< /text>

Just awesome and easy and fast! Couldn't have an easier move (especially when moving can be stressful). Sue made it so smooth - we were quickly and efficiently in getting our unit within minutes.  Thanks so much Sue for making it actually pleasant!<//review>

This place is without a doubt the best run storage facility I’ve ever used. In my personal and professional life I’ve used storage facilities in NorCal, SoCal, Chicago, NYC, Dallas and Houston and NEVER been more impressed with the service, friendliness and overall cleanliness of the facility. I recommend Extra Space Storage in TO without reservation. Vanessa and Sue are total pros, they know the business and treated us with respect and a servants heart. Kudos to both for running g such a well oiled machine. 5 stars...it would be higher but 5 is what is available. Thank you.< /text>

<review>Sue was awesome. She gave me a tour of the facility and showed me multiple units and offered multiple price points. The priceing was very competitive with other storage facilities in the area. I ended up going here because of the new lock system on the doors, the unit security, availability of carts for moving, and the location.< /review><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Sue has been absolutely amazing throughout this entire process! Moving is a rough process in itself, but my circumstances haven’t made it any easier. Sue has been nothing short of incredible during this fine.

Not only is she a total delight on the phone and in person but she has been so accommodating with my crazy schedule.

I am so appreciative of her and thankful I was able to get down there today and get my unit I needed.

Thank you Sue for being so pleasant! You made my storage experience a lot easier than I expected!

I was looking for a storage unit that wouldn’t break the bank, and also had some security given that I would be traveling. I came across this unit provided by ExtraSpace Storage and it’s beyond what I could have imagined. Their security is very thorough and I have no doubt my items are safe. In addition, the Assistant Store Manager Sue, helped me with the process and called to let me know someone else is looking at the unit and even helped me lock it down the same day! Meaning, this company follows through with what they say and I can respect that. Highly recommend using them!!< /Text>

< review>
Feb. 5, 2019 Update. RENTERS BEWARE! Yesterday I received a mailing from Extra Space Storage informing me that my monthly rental rate will increase by 12% (after only 4 months of storage). I would caution anyone that considers using this facility, that you are on a MONTH-TO_MONTH rental and they can increase your rental rate at any time to any rate. 5 star rating just went to a 2 star!

Sue reached out to me to visit the facility and view a storage unit of interest. She was very helpful and polite while showing us around. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and tidy the facility is. Rates are very competitive, and combined with the spotless unit, we decided on a 10' x 10'.</review>

A huge thank you to Sue for providing me with expert professional and friendly service!  I had an urgent need for a second unit, and Sue took the extra time to understand my situation and discuss the options, and it turned out that the unit right next to mine was available! Sue made the whole process quick and easy.  And it was a great deal!  Thanks to Sue everything worked out perfectly! I love renting here:  this is a great facility, very clean, secure, conveniently located, and Sue is a friendly and expert storage professional who provides really fantastic customer service!!<//Text>

I used 2 storage units at this location while I was selling my house and moving to Virginia. I was very pleased with the location and accessibility for the 10x10 unit I used to store "clutter" from my house and the drive in unit to keep my classic corvette in while waiting for the transport company to pick it up. Sue was very helpful in setting up the 2 units and made everything go smoothly.</text>

The only reason this place has so many good reviews is because initially they’re very nice to you and they beg you to write a review for them. I’ve tried to call them multiple times during their open hours and no one ever picks up. I’ve had my unit for over a year. Originally the price was $97 per month. Now then after a few months they raised it to $105 without informing me but I thought, okay that’s fine it’s only $8 more. This month I got charged $119 for my unit with no notice and no explanation for it. I’m highly disappointed in the lack of communication of this company, and I am considering leaving. I’m not sure if it’s this location specifically or the company as a whole, but they should at least communicate with you before they increase prices.</Review>

Sue is the best. She is always quick to respond and helps when there is an issue. The security here is really comforting, I have had no issues (unlike at other competing companies where things get stolen). It is also extremely clean at this facility- which I appreciate. I recommend these guys. Thank you!!<//text>

My entire experience at Extra Space Storage from online reservation to move in was seamless. Sue went over everything with me... made sure my gate code worked, showed me where to park, where to find the dollies,  and where to find both entrances to my building. I also feel very safe with the fact that at all times the doors to all the buildings are locked...and the best feature is the gates are open until 10:00 pm.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>It’s no fun having your things in storage. But if you find yourself in that situation, Extra Space Storage in Thousand Oaks is the place for your valuable belongings. Centrally located off Thousand Oaks Boulevard with convenient hours. The staff is very kind and helpful. I was shown several options as I needed to store my Harley, Vintage Chevy Pickup and other belongings. I found the perfect storage space at a very fair price. And very clean secure units. Highly recommended.

Excellent customer service! Sue was very friendly and helpful and explained everything clearly, and she remembered me after my first visit over a week ago.  She seemed to know everyone coming and going which made me feel extra secure storing my things with extra space.  Wish all businesses had someone as kind and awesome as Sue.</text>

This is a great facility with friendly and expert storage professionals who provide really excellent customer service!!  I had never used storage before and had a lot of questions, and both Conor and Sue were really great and worked with me to explore the situation, presented me with different options, and answered all of my questions.  I looked at other places but got the best storage solution right here - exactly what I wanted, great deal, and the whole process was quick and easy!  As I start to use my storage space, a big thank you to Conor for providing friendly, knowledgeable, and fantastic customer service!!</review>

<review>This was such an effortless transition from my previous storage to this location. Sue is hands down the best person you could ever hope to rent from, her genuinely kind persona and diligent pursuit of the perfect experience put her far far far.  FAR beyond any other employee or competitors in thousand oaks, if your not renting from her, then your really cutting yourself short< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I was in the process of selling my condominion and my first priority was to find a storage unit where all my belongings would be safe until a new home was found. Extra Space on Thousand Oaks Blvd was the winner.  Besides the facility being secure & impeccably clean, the amazing staff Sue & Amanda were professional, prompt at returning my calls & were very reassuring when responding to my initial questions & concerns. Super friendly gals. I never write reviews but this time is an exception. It's rare to find a top notch well run company these days with exceptional customer service.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I love this location. They have always been super friendly and easy to work with, especially the manager Amanda. She is so sweet, even offered me and my son botteled water on multiple occasions. I recently was in need of a move to a larger unit and Sue was so helpful answering all of my questions, trying to get me the best value and right fit for me. These girls are an asset to the company and I hope as long as I'm storing my junk, they are there to help.< /Text>

<text>I've had a storage unit at Extra Space on Thousand Oaks Boulevard for over two years, and it has been an absolutely amazing experience. The owner and manager Amanda is a delight- she is attentive, respectful, responsible, and incredibly kind. She is always there to offer a helping hand with any of your needs. The facility is very clean and I always felt very safe no matter what time of day I was there. I would recommend this storage to anyone!

When I moved in temperatures were above 100 degrees.  Amanda and Sue were amazing at their normal job duties, but they also took on the task of making sure I didn't die.  They gave me cold water bottles throughout the process and let me recover in their air conditioned office.  These two ladies are great, and the storage is very affordable.<//Text>

< Review>
Thank you Sue and Amanda for making my first storage unit rental a comforting experience!!!  I definitely felt reassured with all of the security measures that Extra Space Storage has in place. It's naturally overwhelming when one has to plan move in the first place and then have to place some of your dear items in storage.....These ladies were truly the best and extremely professional!! I feel very at ease leaving my items at their facility. Thank you again Sue and Amanda :)<//Review>

Great Service!!!! I moved to the area and need a storage unit. I reserved it online. I called the staff to confirm the date i was going to see the unit and WOW!!! Excellent service!!  I was able to adjust the day I was going to see with no problems. I spoke with Amanda and she was really helpful and understanding. I met with Sue and she was great and very knowledgeable. The process was quick and I was even able to borrow a lock. The place is very clean and with easy access. I highly recommend this place<//Review>

<Review>I love this location. They have always been super friendly and easy to work with, especially the manager Amanda. She is so sweet, even offered me and my son botteled water on multiple occasions. I recently was in need of a move to a larger unit and Sue was so helpful answering all of my questions, trying to get me the best value and right fit for me. These girls are an asset to the company and I hope as long as I'm storing my junk, they are there to help.</Review><gmapID>0x80e825357c5b7433:0xc17a8d86fe81137c< /gmapID></record>

<Review>In the year or so I've been with E.S.S. #1253, I've moved between differently-sized units 5-6 times, as my storage needs change often. A unit to meet my needs always seems to be available; the units are clean and in good repair; and I've had no security problems in that time. Employees that I've had contact with have always been very professional and courteous. I choose to rent here because it just plain works and there's no dramas.< /Review>< Pictures>

We have never worried about storing our things with this extra space storage facility. The director, Amanda, was very reassuring regarding the facility's security, and we had no issues during our eight months as clients. Would definitely return in the case of future storage needs, and highly recommend to friends.< /Text>

<text>I've had a storage unit at Extra Space on Thousand Oaks Boulevard for over two years, and it has been an absolutely amazing experience. The owner and manager Amanda is a delight- she is attentive, respectful, responsible, and incredibly kind. She is always there to offer a helping hand with any of your needs. The facility is very clean and I always felt very safe no matter what time of day I was there. I would recommend this storage to anyone! You aren't going to find a better one!<//text>< pictures>

I have always utilized Extra Space Storage in the various states I have resided for over ten years because I trust the brand and know I will not have any issues. While I have always been pleased with Extra Space Storage, I have been exceptionally pleased with the employees at the Thousand Oaks location located at 1285 East Thousand Oaks Blvd.

Amanda, the Store Manager is indeed a pleasure to do business with. She, Conner and all other staff I encounter are always professional, are always willing to go the extra mile and treat all of their customers with the greatest integrity and respect. I have personal storage at the site and insisted that my employer utilize the facilities as well for its storage needs. I truly appreciate them and it means so much that they are so friendly and truly personalize their customer service.

Great Job Sore #1253!</text>

My sister and I were moving and after a day of packing and loading we found out that a change of plans we would need to quickly find a storage facility late afternoon. What a stress!
We were very blessed to find Extra Space Storage and extra blessed to have Sue sign us up...not only efficient and professional she also put a spring back in our step with her wonderful and  kind personality.
Excellent storage facility on all counts!
Thank you Sue!

<Review>Our experience with this Extra Space location has been fantastic. We spoke with several different storage companies all over Ventura County during our move but the customer service with Sue in helping us set up our storage unit was the best. Both her and Amanda made us feel comfortable since the beginning  Sue was very communicative and detailed throughout the process. The unit is clean, the location is central and of course the customer service is amazing!!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

They are really nice when you come in (and ask for you to write reviews, that's why they have so many), but after you're in, good luck! I had fraud on my debit card and had to get a new one, and I've been trying to update my billing info. Their website never lets me log in, when I try to reset my password it gives me an error (I have screenshots), they never answer their phone, if you e-mail them it comes back too (also have screenshot). When I finally got ahold of them this morning, they charged me an $85 late fee and said they tried to call me 3 times - BS! I had NEVER been late before and had auto-pay. Not to mention they raised the prices of the storage unit after a month or so in. Not trustworthy, not good customer service!</Review>

The staff at the Thousand Oaks location is amazing! I came in at a busy time with 2 people in front of me and Amanda got to me in less than 2 minutes. Super friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. Top notch service!< /Review>

My daughter is attending Pepperdine and as the time comes for storage between semesters moving from one dorm to another we found Extra Space Storage at 1285 E Thousand Oaks Blvd. The staff were so friendly and went out of their way to accomodate us. The storage unit was environmentally friendly and very clean. The price was outstanding versus everyone else. A little more of a drive, but well worth it!</text>

<Review>I have particular needs for storage and must have checked at least 10-15 storage facilities. ESS has the best web rates. Went to the location to confirm space, etc and was met by Sue, who could not have been more helpful, professional, and most importantly, patient with me as we toured the unit and went through paperwork. Highly recommend. They were up front with all my questions and even when I sensed a situation re: guaranteeing the monthly rate, Sue was upfront and honest... which allowed me the opportunity to make the decision to locknin rate and pay ahead. I feel
Like a small gesture like that- being upfront- helped me down the road circumvent any unforeseen and unexpected issues that would piss me off. or being flounces with a unforeseen higher rate. Thank you Sue! Thank you ESS!</Review><userid>102749804830599603842<//userid><rating>5</rating>< Name>

This is the second storage facility I have stored with and it will definitely be my last! Everything from the aesthetic components to the feel of the facility and the people who work there is amazing. The manager Amanda is everything you can want in someone who represents the face of a company. She is kind, polite, knowledgeable and really makes you feel like you can always come to her with any questions(if by chance she hasn't already answered them!). I highly recommend storing with Extra Space Storage on Thousand Oaks Boulevard.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Extra Space Storage at 1285 Thousand Oaks Blvd in Thousand Oaks CA exceeds our expectations in every way. The facility is spotless and extremely secure with effortless renter access. Sue and Amanda are incredibly helpful and friendly - they never tire of answering all our questions and work hard to make everything just right. The prices are really good too. When we had to rent a space from them in CA but pay from another state, we used the convenient Extra Space Storage online reservation system to stop in at our local facility to sign up for our rental across the country. When it was time for our daughter to move her things into storage in CA for her college summer break and she knew she wouldn't get to Extra Space until after hours, Amanda arranged to have a ladder and carts located right by the entrance to our daughter's storage building for her to use! I cannot imagine a better storage experience anywhere else.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Amanda is personable friendly and efficient. I feel confident leaving my value positions at a storage facility that she manages. And on a personal note I love living in a community where I can run into her in a different setting and she'll remember me and she's cordial and she's friendly this is my second current active unit at this facility because I have such a great admiration for her business practices</text>

Having used a handful of other storage facilities and visited several, I was so happy with our experience at Extra Space Storage.  Amanda couldn't have been any nicer to my wife and I during the move in process.  She even brought us bottles of water while we were loading everything into our unit.  The facility is very secure, incredibly clean, and doesn't have any weird smells haha.  Absolutely recommend Extra Space to anyone looking for a clean, safe, and reasonably priced storage facility!</Text>

I shopped around but It was a no-brainer after seeing the facility and speaking to Amanda. A great place that I highly recommend!< /text><time>1427476934172<//time></record>

Went to the location to confirm space, etc and was met by Sue, who could not have been more helpful, professional, and most importantly, patient with me as we toured the unit and went through paperwork. Highly recommend. They were up front with all my questions and even when I sensed a situation re: guaranteeing the monthly rate, Sue was upfront and honest... which allowed me the opportunity to make the decision to locknin rate and pay ahead. I feel
Like a small gesture like that- being upfront- helped me down the road circumvent any unforeseen and unexpected issues that would piss me off. or being flounces with a unforeseen higher rate. Thank you Sue! Thank you ESS!</Review>< Pics>

I had been renting space at another storage facility in town but I moved everything to your facility at 1285 Thousand Oaks Blvd. because it is so much cleaner and well maintained.  Amanda and her associates are so nice and go out of their way to be helpful.  My belongings have a new home.< /text>

Especially Sue, what a lovely gal!  The units are all in tip top shape, and the facility is easy to get around; plenty of parking near doors, numerous dollys, etc. Excited to have moved out of my previous storage unit and upgraded to what I can honestly call a 5 star storage resort!< /Review>< pictures>

He readily made himself available for us, (as 3 of my relatives rented units) He even stayed late so that we could rent a box 10 minutes before they closed (do to my husband's work schedule) and when the box ended up being too small for our needs, they switched it out for us with no hassle or confusion. This site has a good group of employees with excellent customer service skills! They truly go above and beyond!</Review>< UserId.>

Where to begin.

I want to give Amanda a glowing review for her help today. She was very kind, caring, and understanding. I had to fix my truck today and I knew I had to at least ask if that was ok because this being a storage facility I didn't know if I would be ok. I asked Nico who I saw first, he then took me to Amanda and I talked it over with her. That's when she told me that I was good to go and then proceeded to give me paper towels, a trash bag, and Water. It was a very kind gesture on her part.

I didn't catch the name of the Nice Blonde haired woman sitting at the counter but she was very friendly and understanding as well.

Amanda, Nico, and Nice Blonde lady if you are reading this you are all outstanding individuals. You hold the utmost professional standard while on the job.

If you have read this far and haven't immediately packed all of your things into boxes in order to rent from this facility you should. If the glowing review of the people working here doesn't persuade you then the following should.

The facility is immaculate. I never see any trash on the premise which is a great sign. I can tell you that I have never had one problem with this facility. Not one problem ever, I trust this place completely. You should trust them with your business as well.

Thank you very much.</Text>

There's good reason why  ExtraSpace Storage on Thousand Oaks Blvd is rated so highly. The manager, Amanda Ware brings Southern hospitality to Southern California. Her storage management expertise is incomparable. She provides the utmost in customer service. Not only is she highly competent at her job, she is the most helpful, caring and truly kind person you could meet. She is always ready to help!  This storage facility is so clean and well run, you can feel completely confident knowing your possessions are safe as the entire staff are always on the look-out for any possible issues. Our company has had a long-standing relationship with ExtraSpace, and we wouldn't think of using another facility. I can't recommend ExtraSpace store #1253 enough. Thank you Amanda, for being a great manager and always taking such great care of your customers!<//Text>

BrI aND Amanda were great.  So friendlt, helpful, and thorough.  Brie even held my hand by taking me to help me figure out my key by my side the first time.  WI'll definitely recommend Extra Space to friends, as family recommended ES to me.< /Review>

ExtraSpace Storage is near the corner of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Rancho Road in Thousand Oak, CA.  I work in the office which shares a parking lot with their facility so my review here is not as a customer, but actually as their neighbor.  I’ve been very impressed with the overall quality of their business.  The onsite manager is dedicated to honest service, staff development, daily operations, and store maintenance.  If you’re searching for a secure and clean location to keep your valuables, then I would personally recommend the ExtraSpace Storage at 1285 Thousand Oaks Boulevard.<//review>

<Review>The very first day I have rented a unit from this place, and my security code will not allow me to get into the building of my unit. I was told I would have access the very same day. Please find other nearby storage companies who will actually do what they are in the industry for.</Review>< gmapID>

I have never eaten at any El Pollo Loco before. So for years I have been missing out on the amazing food. I ordered two of the 4 piece meals. Then substituted the meat for all chicken  breasts with a side of pinto beans and rice. Corn tortillas  of course. Then proceeded to eat with friends. It felt like a Pollo-giving dinner.</review>

The food is delicious and healthy and the portions a good.  Quality-wise, I would say Pollo Loco is far superior to most fast-food places.  And I have always been happy with the service at this specific location.  Keep it up Pollo!</Text>

El Pollo Loco is definitely worth the wait. The chicken was juicy and the fries were great.  I had the extra hot and it wasn't too spicy. My girl friend decided to try the reaper and couldn't handle it. I tried a small piece and man was it hot. It really lives up to its name. My taste buds were dead after trying it. The staff is very nice. They cleaned our table, checked on our food , and even brought us milk when we told them we had ordered the reaper flavor. It's very loud in there due to the high volume of people. Overall delicious food!< /review>

I bought a original pollo bowl and keto taco. Omg, the keto taco is incredibly yummy. The bowl was good, however I didn't like the rice. I don't recall there being rice in it before but perhaps I said no rice previously. Tje taco made up for it. I just started going back to El P. recently after getting food poisoning a year ago. The Keto taco is my new favorite.<//review>

The food here is always good and fresh.  My favorite is the original pollo bowl combo for just $5.   You just can't beat that.  They also mail out coupons and have coupons in their app.  It's definitely one of my favorite places to eat.  I highly recommend it.< /review>

I bought tostada for $8. The container is big, very nice, and big. But that's the only positive things that I can say. I can estimate that the tostada include one spoon of beens, one spoon of rice, chicken breast dry and hard to choo, lettuce and tomato in small amount. I don't think it's worth $8.< /Text>

Drive thru is terrible. Wouldn't split car order in 2 because it would mess up rush hour orders? Tostada had about 8 pieces of chicken. Won't be going back to this location.</review>

$5.99 boxes that I found to be two meals they have some kind of bee burrito in there and I'm not crazy about burritos but this is a not oversized perfect one very delicious filled with all kind of good stuff and two tacos and a drink a medium drink for that price. One of the boxes they have even has those cinnamon spirals in it so you get a little dessert.

< review>
I ordered catering for 16 people. I ordered about 1 hr and  45 mins before I needed it and they were able to accommodate it. The food was ready by the time I got there (I was late by 15 mins)  so that was a relief since I was running late.  I didn't know they deliver for just $5, so I think that is a great value for the service. Might use their delivery in the future.

The food I ordered was correct and complete.  They provided the napkins, utensils and plates... everything was there as I requested.  The food was still hot,  it didn't disappoint.
I was happy with the whole experience and purchase. Very fast and convenient.<//review>

While I was ordering I noticed they didn't have any corn cake on the menu and the cashier was very knowledgeable even about the year they stopped selling it ..  love it great job< /Review><GmapID>0x80c29979282abe7d:0x72ea0a46cb5ecb05</GmapID><resp>None</resp><Time>1517474519492</Time>< userid>

Terrible delivery service. Ordered delivery an hr ago and the guy still hasn't arrived. I called the store but the line just continued to ring with no answer. Once he came after an hour I told the driver I would like to cancel my order and he told me just give me $10 and I'll give you the food. I gave it to him because I felt bad, but I told the store I wanted my order canceled. So if he pocketed my $10 I would like to report theft within your company, and I was very un satisfied with the quality of service given, thanks to my hour delivery I was late to work myself. Well done El Pollo Loco.</Review>

The drive thru can be a tight fit if you have a large vehicle. This location is on par with the rest so you can expect the usual tasty chicken that they make. Service is always pretty quick. Drive thru is my main gripe for this location.</review>

<date>1508889298707<//date><Rating>2</Rating><Text>I am tired of their bad service. I ask for extra salsa every time and they give me like two small containers about an inch tall or so and barely fill them half way. I have ordered Mac n cheese several times, and the last two times, I have gotten corn pieces in my Mac n cheese(I do not order corn). This has happened TWO times in a row from my experience. I am not sure if they are sloppily opperating from the food trays and using the same serving spoon, but what ever it is that causes the problem has to be stopped. They have also gotten orders wrong on many occasions.

On a more happy note, the flavors are great if they are not blended with other things I did not order, I highly suggest the Pollo bowl, one of my favorites. I am not saying not to go to the El Pollo Loco, but it isn’t something I would choose if I had the option.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1508950841093, 'text': 'Hi Nicholas, we’re so sorry to hear about your recent experience with us.

We are pleased that you appear to be enjoying the service.  As an express-exterior car wash, our customers do indeed generally bring a microfiber towel with them to catch any remaining drops.  The backs of many cars are the hardest area\'s to blow water off of due to the design of the vehicles.  Please reach out to our friendly manager, Alex Quiros when you can and discuss with him your comments on "the wheel section."  We have two sets of wheel cleaning chemicals that go on the tires and rims and 3 sets of high-water blasters to clean rims.  If rims are particularly dirty with caked on brake dust, it may be impossible for it all to come off.  Our unlimited club plan customers tend to have cleaner rims as they get cleaned more regularly.  Hope that helps.  Lastly, if you are speaking of the tire dressing machine.  Just as in every express car wash, this feature is a one-size fits all and certain tires (low profile or extra large) may not get treated as efficiently as more typically sized tires.  Thanks again Jeff.  We look forward to hearing from you and we always appreciate the feedback.'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80dd2f055384232d:0x7552eeb2e1532702< /GmapID>< Review>
It was pretty fast seem to clean the car well back was done pretty well would suggest wiping it down after on the back. Vacuums were nice. The wheel section doesn't work as well as I would like.</Review>

{'time': 1627828742950, 'text': 'Hi Melinda.  Thank you for the nice comments.  Regarding your comment on tire dressing.  This is the single most difficult service to offer in an express car wash format.  The machine has to be designed in such a way that it has to be a "one size-fits all.".  As a result, most tires are a great fit.  In cases where we encounter oversized or low profile rims, the machine as result can\'t perform perfectly.  In fact, prior to our car wash coming on-line, I myself visited another express wash regularly and asked them to retract the tire-dressing machine as my tires were not ideal.    This is the one machine that we service and clean daily to maximize performance.  A lot of car washes don\'t keep up with it and the results can be unsatisfactory on all tires.  We hope that helps and thanks again for the business.  Don\'t ever hesitate to contact us for any reason.'}</Response>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>It is what it is. If your car really needs a wash and you’re in a hurry, it’ll do like any other drive through car wash — it will not get to the unique contours of your car and you shouldn’t expect that. You are paying a premium for a convenient, new facility that washes and dries it quickly (<2 mins total?) and has some perks like a dash wipe and air freshener. Staff was very nice but I miss the old Rossmoor Car Wash.</text>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1622038677880, 'text': 'Michael, thank you for the nice comments regarding our super friendly team and for recognizing the convenience presented in a modern express car wash like ours.  We totally understand you missing the old Rossmoor Car Wash.  It was indeed a 60+ year institution.  Unfortunately, "old" was getting older and modernization became necessary. As I\'m sure you\'ve noticed, full-service car washing is becoming harder to find due to a myriad of factors.  The good news is that many ex-full service customers like you can benefit from a new model.  Many of our customers have a detailer give their car a thorough inside and out detail job 1-12 times a year depending on what they like.  The rest of the time, they keep their car "maintained" at our state of the art express wash.  Our Ceramic X-3 Fusion process will keep your car looking good to the point that many tell us that they don\'t need a detail almost ever.  Our Unlimited Club plan allows for just that.  We thank you for your business and hope that you might try this model yourself and that we can convert you to a 5-star reviewer and loyal customer soon.'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2f055384232d:0x7552eeb2e1532702<//Gmap_id></record>

<Response>{'time': 1619189826865, 'text': "Brian,  thank you so much for the great review.  Indeed, we are keeping our helpful employees present to make sure all of our new customers can process quickly at our pay stations.  Regarding prices, they are based on the investment put in to making this wash process and location the finest in Southern CA.  From our unique conveyor system to the top of the line chemistry that washes, shines and protects the huge investment you have in your vehicle, we believe folks like you will continue to see the value compared to other washes that tend to base their pricing on let's just say; a lesser investment in process.  Now, to your final comment, the UNLIMITED CLUB PLAN is what we call a real no brainer.  Our top package, the Ultimate Shine and Protection wash is normally $20 per visit.  Sign up on our club plan and only come in once a week for example?  Well, your price drops to less than half that on a per visit basis.  It's a crazy good deal for folks who want to keep their ride looking great all the time and allows us to reward our most loyal customers like you!  Thanks again Brian!"}< /Response>< name>

The process is fast and easy. There was an employee at the entrance to help with payment who was very friendly.. Prices are a bit on the high side but you're really paying for the convenience of getting your car washed quickly and thoroughly. The free do-it-yourself vacuum across all price packages is also great. If you're obsessive about keeping your car clean, the unlimited packages seem like a good deal.</text>

As far as automated car washes go, it is great!  It's clean and brand new and the employees customer service is great.  They have three levels of washes you can choose from, the cheapest is $10.  I drive a 2021 Hyundai Palisade and it felt like a tight squeeze going in so I don't think you'll want to bring big or lifted trucks here.  After you get out of the wash they have free vacuums for you.  I do miss the old Los Alamitos carwash that used to be at this location because they hand dried and vacuumed everything for you.  I had to dry the missed spots myself when I got home.  Overall, it's a top of the line automated carwash, but if you want it hand dried and vacuumed by an actual person so you don't have to do it yourself look elsewhere.< /text>

You aren't the first to say you miss Rossmoor Car Wash, the full-service car wash that was on site for 62 years.  As we've said to others that have posted the same thing, full-service car washing is becoming hard to find these days for a myriad of reasons.  You also  mentioned a tight squeeze.  That is interesting as our tunnel can handle most any vehicle that shows up.  Lastly, it is a great idea to bring a microfiber towel with you as like every express exterior car wash, there will always be some drops left on the car.  We have the most powerful dryers around, but water does harbor in places on cars depending on the model.  Hope to see you soon Jason.  I trust we will get you to a 5-star reviewer in no time.

<Review>I used this car wash the other day, and it was great.  Absolutely state-of-the-art.  The staff were plentiful and knowledgeable.  The little touches were nice, like they taped down my rear wiper.  My car came out super clean (and it was SUPER dirty when I got there), and the drying part of the process is so effective that my car was essentially dry when I drove away.  Very impressed, and I will be back.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Resp>{'time': 1620137856232, 'text': 'Michael, We love the review and thank you for it,.  Our conveyor is one of the many great things that makes Clean Wave top of class we think.  Now, let us be honest here.  We knew our conveyor could handle low cars and big tires, we just didn\'t think we could take a "dully" due to it having two tires in the back!  We just checked with our conveyor manufacturer and they said it is indeed possible as you figured out.  Our manager was off the day you came in we think and our team apparently was not as concerned as he would have been.  With that said, would you please kindly reach out to Alex Quiros our manager and let him know when you are coming in next?  We want to watch your vehicle from beginning to end to make sure it is safe for your truck and our tunnel equipment.  It would be awesome if it is as we will be one of the few car washes that can accomodate you.  Thanks for all the good vibes and 5-star review.

The intent of the sign is simply to ask our customers to keep their time in the stall productive when the car wash is super busy as we only have 13 vacuum spots.  I'm not sure we've asked anyone to move on unless they've chosen to use the stall as a detail area (waxing their car etc...)

Meh. Too expensive for what is. For $20, get a hand wash and dry. Otherwise, $10 is still too much for a basic wash when the others are charging $5-6. I live in Rossmoor, so I know they are using the location as an excuse to charge more.<//review>

<text>I signed up immediately when they opened, the girl I signed up with stated they had a promotion for  monthly membership the first month would be $20 and then every month after that would be $25 a month. Suddenly, my card was being charged $35 a month. Felt like a big Bait and Switch. So I cancelled.
Which was fine because I was only sticking with this car wash for the price. I prefer the wash quality at the Mobil Station down the street in Seal Beach, especially since they have compressed air so that you don’t have water spots all over. I have a white vehicle and the tire dressing at CleanWave was way to heavy so it would splatter all over the sides of my car leaving black splatters. So at the end of the day, I’d rather spend more at Mobil’s Car Wash or La Palma car wash to not be victim of dishonest business practices.<//text>< Pics>

Very friendly staff, manager even came by to check on me as I vacuumed..  Their machine is wonderful, price is a bit higher than I pay at H2Go, but the machine and convenience would be worth it.  Then I see they close at 5p on weekdays.  That is the deal breaker.</text>

Would you please reach out to our manager, Alex Quiroz at your earliest convenience so that he can review your situation?  This is a bit perplexing as we have been getting great feedback from customers with oversized tires.  They tell us how easy it is to load onto our flat - surface conveyor as there are no "tire channels" to have to fit into like most car washes.  We are curious as to why your truck had trouble in this instance.  In any case, we would like to review the situation and see if we can see to it that you would have a better experience next time.\n\nIf you prefer to email him, his email is alex@cleanwaveexpress.com. Please provide your contact information so that he can help resolve any issues as quickly as possible. Thank you.  Alex is looking forward to speaking with you at your earliest convenience.'}< /resp>

Coming from a customer that used to frequent the previous Rossmoor Carwash, Clean Wave Express offers a very different type of service.  While it now has arguably better value, faster service and has almost no human interaction in this COVID environment, it no longer includes any interior cleaning/detailing.  Therefore interior windows with finger prints, door jambs will have to be cleaned at a different location.  Furthermore, the fully automated exterior wash will miss the more complicated and difficult to reach areas such as emblems, scoops and wheels.  Wheel and tire shine most definitely missed spots.  This is a good maintenance clean between more thorough detailing service or if 90-95% clean of the majority of exterior surfaces is sufficient.  That being said, services costing half, or less than half of previous full service carwash is greatly appreciated.<//text>

{'time': 1608849830150, 'text': 'Hi Tony,\nThank you so much for visiting us during our recent opening of Clean Wave Express Car Wash.  We are certainly sorry that you are missing the the full-serve nature of the previous car wash.  Unfortunately, full-service car washing is becoming more and more difficult to find these days.  What most of our new customers seem to be doing that may be helpful to you is joining our unlimited wash club plan for all their "maintenance" washing needs.  They save a lot of money and can literally come in on any day of the month when their car needs a cleaning and perhaps a quick vacuum.\n\nDepending on how often they want the car detailed inside an out, they call in a detailer to do that once a month or 4 times a year etc....  Please know that we are continuing to make tweaks to our process as we complete our opening weeks here.  The feedback we are getting on site is that we are getting the cleanest and shiniest and most protected car out of any express wash in the area.  We have invested greatly in a state of the the art-wash system and we are excited for you to continue to experience its benefits.  Please speak to us directly on site anytime you have a question.  Our friendly staff is always available to answer any questions or concerns you may have.   Thank you again for coming in.  We appreciate your business greatly.'}</response>

It was my first time here, their food was good and their employees are extremely nice. We ordered coffee and tea and some appetizers. It was extremely cold outside so I decided to ask the employee to turn on the heater( which she did) . Overall It was a nice place< /text>

< Review>
I went to Patatas for a birthday lunch before and ordered the seafood paella.  It was delicious.  My friend went to the buffet area and got salmon.  She loved her food, too.  I would definitely go again, but check when they're open.  I had wanted to go on a weekend and it was closed.<//Review>

This is still one of my all time favorite go-to cafe's.  I love the food (especially the brisket sandwich - hold the tomatoes...lol!) and the ambiance is the best for a nice neighborhood spot. Glad I work in their neighborhood. I will continue to recommend Patatas Kitchen to my friends and clients.</review>

Cozy spot with something for everyone. I really enjoy the empanadas with a glass of wine. But their Paellas are excellent and are great to entertain a crowd if you want to go big and order for your party.< /text>

This is a cozy (i.e. tiny) place with a nice happy hour special on weekdays. The sangria was okay (not quite fruity enough for me) and the small empanada that comes with it during HH was very tasty. The garlic shrimp was a disappointment because it was mushy in texture and we had to peel off the shell which had all the flavor in order to eat it. The beef stew was hearty and simple.  Overall we enjoyed our visit--it was busy and the one server there was doing a great job. There are other tapas I'd like to try if I return there.<//Review>

Service was Kind after a Beautiful Spiritual Service. I was surprised that they didn't have too many Vegan/Vegetarian selections... and not so many Potato's Entrees to choose from... Maybe think about some more Potato type of Food Dishes?😁💎💚🕉️

During most of our dining experience they played smooth jazz which was really nice. Then someone in the kitchen started blasting Norteño (bouncy Mexican accordian music). The two were playing at the same time; it ruined the chill vibe.<//Text>< gmapID>

I thought I was going to walk in to a very large place with lots of paptatas employees running around working and customers waiting in line to get in the place but it was quite the opposite very quiet but busy.  Beside the behind scene cook in the back who prepared homemade empanadas there was one busy server whom I notice held everything else down. Tiffany, She was the only one I met that was as friendly and brought my order nice and hot. Thanks tiffany!</text>

Absolutely authentic!
My fist time , I've ordered via Caviar but I highly recommend to stop by and hangout at the patio and enjoy your paella Al-fresco . Service is attentive, effective at suggesting dishes and if you are in luck, you will get to see Chef Marcos in action and let you taste something extraordinary 'Not in the menu'.
Inside seating is available - recommended for small groups only ambiance is cozy, my favorite by far the outside area. 👍🏽
Linguini with seafood is made fresh and flavors are authentic.
Paellas are the best part.. beautifully​ made,  fresh seafood and so tasty..
Definitely try it again..
One more spot in Emeryville to the list.<//Review>

Dr Batt was very responsive and informative. I requested an Invermectin prescription and received it within an hour.

Excellent medical services.
Dr. Batt listen's well, and asked helpful, comprehensive questions. He offered valuable advise on filling my prescription at the lowest cash cost. My medication was covered by insurance. This is not always true, or covered cost can exceed the cash price. I highly recommend Dr. Batt for your medical needs.< /Text>

Dr Batt is very responsive, knowledgeable and thorough provides not only the basics but peripheral treatment information and guidelines to watch for also.<//Text>

Very quick on responding back. It’s hard for me to get time off from work. Dr.Batt made it very easy for me and I did not have to take time off from work.  This has been a great experience. I will definitely be contacting him again for any medical needs.<//Text>

Terrible customer service.  Pretending pandemic is reason to close the bathroom.  I wish i had gotten my gas at the Foodmart up the road.  Purchased nothing but was greeted with friendly respect and bathroom use. Go to the Foodmart. Good price and great customer service. And clean.< /Review>

Cashier was extremely rude. We completed our transaction 3 times and it would say accepted but he told us it was declined for various reasons. When we asked why, he cut us off and yelled at us. Horrible customer service.< /Review>

Although the gas is cheap, the arrangement of the pumping stations don't allow for easy flow of traffic. People are often jammed up waiting for other cars to finish pumping before they can leave or enter.</text>

I wish they had negative stars. Just went here after walking back inside 5 times because the pump wasnt working. Guy kept making it seem like i didnt know how to pump gas. Im well educated and have pumped many times this wasnt my first rodeo. Never going here again because of that guy who i think is the manager. Never going to revomend this place either. No one should have to walk back and forth from the gas station to their 5 times in 100 degree heat because the guy behind the counter was too lazy to see what happend and too lazy to care. What a jerk!!!< /Text>

If I could give these guys a 0 star, I WOULD!  I booked my appointment online for Tuesday @7pm. They arrive 10:43 am. Well, that didn't work out since I wasn't home at that time.  Then they reschedule me for Thursday @ 7pm.  Again, they pushed it back 4 more times and the final time, the groomer "Anderson" said sorry, but your home route is too complicated for me and my company will send a new person to you tomorrow.  That is just poor customer service!!!  I'm so done with these guys because they waisted 3 days of my time and never showed up!  The first time I used them they were perfect.  I was so happy with the groomer and their service, but this time was HORRIBLE!< /Review>

<Date>1615171362929<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Awful experience with 60 Bucks Mobile Grooming. Groomer Cleiton did a bad job on my dog. This was our second time using this company, and the first time we had a different groomer who did an immaculate job. Since the woman we first used was not available, we chose Cleiton since it said he liked to work with Terriers.

First, he showed up 15 minutes late with no apology. He did not take a few minutes to get my dog to warm up to him, he took about 20 seconds and when Koa resisted going into the van he picked her up in a questionable manner. Said it would take an hour, which is again questionable since the previous groomer from this company took 2 hours.

When Koa was done, right off the bat I noticed POOP next to her eye!! This means he did not do a final check of his work! When he tried to wipe it off, koa was very fearful and wouldn’t sit still so he PULLED HER BY THE TAIL. I was in shock. There is a photo with the poop stain next to her left eye.

I then saw her BLEEDING in two places on her left hind leg and when he tried to clean it I had had enough and said I’d take care of it. He cut two of her moles off. Upon further inspection I saw her clip was very choppy, jagged, and uneven in many places. He also did not finish clipping the scruff off her legs and tail. The tail looks like he just chopped off the top. He cut many of her toenails too short so they were bleeding, this is very painful for dogs. Afterwards I petted her for over an hour until she fell asleep. I can't imagine what she must have gone through.

It was clear that he RUSHED the entire process and did not consider making her comfortable would make it easier for him. Maybe if he took his time he wouldn’t have injured her and made mistakes. And my dog has lost trust in men. Today at the dogpark she was aggressive towards men!! I can’t let her offleash anymore I’m too scared she will hurt a man! This new behavior will take a lot of time and work to change.

So thank you Cleiton for giving my dog a messy haircut, causing her pain, and causing a hightened fear towards men. You can’t rush dog grooming. What he did was unacceptable and we will never be able to use a mobile dog groomer again since she associates pain and fear with dog grooming vans. It’s already difficult to trust a stranger taking your pooch into a van where you can’t see or hear what’s going on! I’m taking Koa to PetSmart for now since you can see them clipping the dogs! I’ve lost all trust!<//text>< Pictures>

Everything went smoothly. Happy with our dogs cut. I did trim up his toes a bit more as there were a few long hairs left, no big deal.</Text>

<Date>1621738360014</Date><Review>Angel is the best communicator ever. It was my first time contacting a mobile groomer for my 5 month old Pomeranian & he listened to what I wanted for my puppy. It’s a good thing I got his contact because I’m definitely going to have him groom my dog from now on. And on top of that, he made her looks SOOOOOO adorable!!<//Review>< username>

My dog was returned still damp (the groomer did not blow dry and comb out).  Once my dog's coat dried ---after about 4 hours-- and I combed him out, I found many areas where coat was not cut evenly, so had to take my own scissors to try to even out his cut.< /text>

Francisco and his partner were fantastic. I let them know that my big 12yro dog gets tired so I prefer brevity over perfection. Zoe also has cataracts and they were great with her. She was shaved and looked really good in less than 2hours. Zoe was happy and not traumatized even though this was our first time with 60 Bucks Mobile Grooming. We have found our new groomer!</text>

<Time>1598890357087< /Time><rating>5<//rating><Text>We were evacuated from the CZU Lightning Complex Fires and stayed at a local hotel in Capitola for 2 weeks.  Our two 20 pound dogs were stinky from all the differing foods/treats, moving about, and outside activities.  I reserved mobile grooming appts for them and was offered an appointment the same day and within 2 hours!  To my delight the groomers arrived on time and honestly I am so grateful!  My dogs are generally cautious with strangers yet warmed to them easily enough. They spent about 45 minutes with each dog. Bathed, nails, a behind squeeze.  My dogs look, feel, and smell fantastic!  During this crisis I am so grateful for the responsive and much needed TLC.  It was easier for us to pay cash vs Venmo. My dogs each came back smiling with tails wagging.  I recommend them and will consider booking again.

Thank you, Erwin and to your assistant groomer!<//Text>< Pics>

We were really happy to get this service with Kenia, first she canceled on me because she said her truck was having issues then we reschedule for the day after my actual appointment. She texted me that she was going to be late, its understanble i thought then she told me that she wasnt gonna come to my appointment because she has been at my apartment before and they told her they didnt request an appointmen and on top of that she said somebody else was using my phone number, this is my first time EVER requesting a service with this type of companies she didnt even bother to call me and ask me to come downstairs, to me it looks like she was just making excuses when she could of just told me she wasnt able at first! Horrible experience! Never in my life coming back or recommending.< /Text>

NEVER AGAIN!!! The groomer did not speak English?!?!? Certain requests were not completed because she was unable to communicate...a rather basic requirement. When I called to express concern about it after the fact, I was treated with rudeness and condescension. I was also told that if they sent someone back to correct everything, that they could not send a different groomer, otherwise they would have to charge another time. Their response here below as you can see, is an empty, and disingenuous nothing. !!!BEWARE!!!< /Text>

My snappy Maltese was handled so well I actually thought they hypnotized her
She’s been banned from other groomers and when I ask if they would return they said of course
Super easy they come to the house as well
Huge thumbs up</review>

I am very satisfied with the way they took care of my baby. Her nails were done, she smelt so good, and most of all, she didn’t get anxiety from it. I will definitely have them out once a month for the full service! Super convenient since they come to my house.</Review>

We were told it could take 2 hours to get our dog groomed. These people were fast like an hour. People were very nice and tried to trim our puppy’s head as best they could.</text>

Kevin was Daisy’s groomer. Daisy is a 15lb Rat Terrier.  He took good care of her and she smelled so much better after her bath. Her nails were trimmed and she’s no longer trying to bite them off. He arrived early and finished within the 2 hour time frame. Thanks Kevin!< /review>

Convenient booking online - Same day appointment- convenient to have the van come to our home - even contacted us to say he could come earlier if we wanted to- Angel did a good job with our little Havanese/Bichon - cut looks nice - reasonable price.</Text>

Johnny was wonderful!! My AXLROSE cried one the way to the van and when Johnny took him he quieted down.  He felt at ease with Johnny!!

Thanks Johnny!

The only thing I would fix is getting new grooming vans for them!

Henrique did a great job with our elderly lab, Mikey, and our young terrier, Kimo. Mikey sheds so much and Henrique debulked his fur and he smells so nice now. We have tried to groom Kimo ourselves during quarantine but he is wiggly and won’t let us cut his nails. He came out so cute after Henrique, with trimmed nails!  I also felt the company was very responsive. I wrote to a few groomers and 60 Bucks got right back to me on a Saturday, so they got my business. Will definitely use again.<//Text>

<Text>Fernando arrived promptly when he said he would. He parked right out front my downtown apartment building and was friendly and professional. My pup looked amazing afterwards and I was so impressed how he didn’t miss any spots when shaving and trimming him. His tail is the cutest it’s ever looked and he smells SO good! I’m happy that he took his time with Henry and clipped each of his nails that he is often fussy with. I am so pleased with this service and I will be requesting  Fernando the next time Henry needs a cut. Very pleased with this service.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I was told that they serve Gilroy and to call customer service. I did. I schedule an appointment they accepted it.
Two days later they cancelled and told me that they don't server Gilroy. Then a day later then asked me to give them a review.
What can I say. I will try to groom my freaking dogs myself. $200 in my pocket instead of theirs.<//review>< user>

My dog is four years old and we’ve never had a problem with a groomer, well until now. The employee scared my dog, and put a muzzle on him. Once he felt uncomfortable then then refused to complete the service after he wouldn’t be still in this unfamiliar environment. He’s a certified service dog and has receives complements for being very mild temper so I was very disappointed when this didn’t work out and I truly believe it was the staffs inability to effectively work with dogs. Personally I would bot recommend this company despite the price and mobile portion.</Text>

They let you pick and choose which part of the package you want which is awesome because you can get 2 large dogs washed and dried for $120 and you don't have to commit to all the froo froo stuff if you don't want to!  This makes it so my pooches can get washed 2 times a month instead of only once which makes us all a lot happier.  Would highly recommend this service to anyone asking around.< /review>< pictures>

Gerson's was amazing.  My dog was a bit nervous & Gerson provided her with comfort,  which allowed me to let him do his job & come back when he was finished. My dog Rascal is a super friendly  dog & loves to give kisses. She wasnt to sure about going in the van but it's not unusual  for her to not want to get in vehicles, she has never liked driving
In the car. When Rascal was done, Gerson brought her over to me. I actually  set up mother appointment since I had surgery  on my hip & bathing her has been a challenge, I will be scheduling every 3 weeks.  I recommend  both 60 Buckw mobile  grooming  as well as Gerson.

This Gerson, much appreciated.

Very quick and easy. In and out in about 10 minutes total. Friendly staff and efficient service. Parking lot is small so it can be difficult when busy so maybe call before you go. Open on Saturday and Sunday so that's a plus.<//review>

These guys were great. I think I got there just before they were going to have their lunch but they immediately got busy with my vehicle. As they were finishing mine it got pretty busy. I hope they were able to reheat their food. Thanks guys!</review>

Kind of hard to find (you have to drive behind the building), and no A/C in the waiting room.

But they're SUPER fast.

You can save some money if you get a Groupon.</text>

The gentleman who helped me were very professional and kind. They weren't able to help me the morning that I want to get my truck smogged. The machine was down. So he referred me to the location in Fontana/Rialto and gave me a $10 discount for having to make the drive. But besides the price being amazingly cheap, the service was great at both locations and all 3 gentlemen made a returning customer out of me. Definitely recommend them.< /review>

I have had five vehicles smogged here and recommend to everyone. They are not going to rip you off, they are very fast and friendly. Great price, no hidden fees, and coupons for even better price.  I don't live close to them, but it is worth the extra drive.<//review>

Great shop that was open Sunday morning.  They did a thorough smog check of my vehicle and were great in getting me out the door quickly.  The guys that were working there were professional, friendly, and knew their stuff. I will definitely use them again and will recommend them to friends! A+++<//Text>

After heading to the DMV this morning to get my vehicle registered I was told I needed a smog check. So I did what most people do, I googled “Smog check near me”. I was very fortunate and lucky to have found this place. Most Smog Check locations wanted $50 and had a minimum of a one hour wait. However at Mission Smog he quoted me at $40 and was very polite and professional. Please googlians if your car smoked please come here. It’s worth the drive and it’s a hidden little gem.</Text>

<Text>Great shop with great service! Got a smog check done and unfortunately failed but the employees did not charge me and actually told me why I failed and showed me what I needed to fix in order to pass. These guys are extremely professional and probably have some of the best customer service I seen! Highly recommend to anybody!!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Definitely coming back! It was actually recommended to me by a friend. The only reason why I came was because of how fast they're suppose to be. You're in and out within 10 minutes! To be honest I thought they were gonna over charge me because of how fast they are but it turned out to be that I only paid $35 out the door. So yeah, coming back again.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They are open seven days a week varies depending on the day. It's a Star smog stations so is really convenient for me. A small cost $40 but if you post a Yelp review it comes out to $35. they were very quick to do the smog and I was in now in 10 minutes. If you need a smog come to this place you won't regret it.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb3cd27f3e20b:0xb3d6b695b25e8da8<//Gmap_id></record>

Price was well under what other places had quoted,  and it took under 15 minutes. They had a spacious,  air-conditioned office while I waited as well. I received the certificate and it was submitted electronically and I was done.

Will 100% come back with all my other smog needs. Worth driving for the price I was given as well!</review>< resp>

I always love this place, even during the Xmas season. Most of the staff is calm and collected, and very helpful and nice. Some of the floor inventory gets a little sloppy during the holiday season, but it's expected?</Review>

Staff seemed to be upset and not very friendly. Letting children behind the registers and forgetting to remove security tags from clothing. Store was a bit messy and not very crowded to cause such a mess.</text>

Not exactly my style, but if you like their commercials, then you know what your going to get when you walk thru their doors. The sales staff is eager to please, and we'll informed. Kids seem to really like the styles they sale, but if your over 40 it might not be your cup of tea. Store was very clean and organized making it very easy to track down anything you might need.</Text>

Excellent customer service. They didn't have the size jeans I wanted in stock, so they ordered a pair from another nearby location and shipped them to me for free. I'll definitely be coming back to this location again.<//Text>

Unfortunately for me, this the closest old navy to where I live. There's a lady there (might be the manager) that is so rude to me I just avoid her when I'm there. She's condescending and no help when asked questions. I do like their inventory but I rather make the drive to the glendora store where staff is way friendlier and helpful. Sorry and fix it! I love old navy and I want to love your store!!!</Review>

Ordered online, went to the store to pick up and the didn't have any record of the transaction even though we had already paid 3 hours prior. Had to wait in the store for an hour for them to get the "stuff" together.< /Review>

So, I basically live here. Mr. Palmer and his staff never cease to amaze! The clearance rack and I have an intimate relationship. Best fuel, Best prices! They take care of active, and retired military. Thank you.
Commissary always great quality and stock.<//text>

V. A. Hospital does not offer anything like this.
And don't forget to pick up some groceries while your on the base as well.<//text>< Pictures>

Was a terrific place to shop , then they changed the store products and essential merchandise. Now nothing is there worth buying, the items you want and need are no longer there. San Diego has the best exchange, it is to far to drive.</Text>

They do not open on time. It is 9:07 and we’re still waiting for a manager to come lift the gate completely. There’s about 7 of us standing out just waiting. Not stocked up very well and not everything has price tags which makes it very annoying.<//review>

Donavan, at the wireless cell phone booth, is an absolute treasure. He has helped me with my cell phone drama for over a year.  I'm totally technology challenged and he has gone out of his way to troubleshoot each of my issues. If you looked up customer service online- you'd see a picture of Donavan.< /Text>

This is a small Exchange located on the Air Force Base for active duty military, dependents, retirees and veterans.  They carry all of the brands consistent with other Exchanges just in a smaller footprint building.< /review>

<text>I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and friendliness of staff. I’d advise to go early given the 50 person daily intake right now (went at 6:15 and was about 10th in line and I actually left before the official opening time). I’d recommend this animal hospital.< /text>< rate>

I've been taking my dog here for the past year and I've had not one issue. They've handled my love with such care, that I never worry about the cost or wait- not that it's much of a factor at this location. They typically charge around $11 per injection; their day of operation run from Monday to Saturday; they accept cash and card. One thing to note: arrive early! They do not accept appointments. I've had to show up at 6:30 am(everytime) to ensure, I'm out of there by 9 am. Ooohh, bring a chair or a book! Also, coffee! Don't forget the coffee.<//text>

The wait was long, but they took walk-ins, and at least you could get an appointment, which as been more difficult due to the Covid situation.  They were quick and resolved the vomiting issue with my sick foster kitten.  I would highly recommend this vet to others in the future.</review>

<review>It was good yes there might be a big line but they go through the list pretty quick. I woke around 5:30 am to be the first and there where 4 people before me yes 5 am but there are no appointments so first come first serve type of deal. Parking is hard so keep that in mind. If your pet suffered a terrible accident then they will try to get to you as fast as possible. All in all good 👍</review>< pictures>

TL;DR - First time going to NFAH and am extremely satisfied with their service.  (Reason: Vaccines ($12/ea), Spay, Microchip ($40)).  Love that they're affordable and provide amazing care for all the pets. Got in line around 6:40a (~25 ppl ahead of me) and was out by 8:30a.  Came back around 5:20p for pick up and was out by 6p.  All the employees were friendly and nice, including those at the front desk.  Highly recommend and would come back.

Downside is how early you have to get in line to wait since it's walkin only (bring a portable chair!).  Upside is actually getting in when all other animal hospitals/vets are booked solid through June-Sept.

PARKING OPTIONS
- NFAH Lot - When facing the building from Fig, the driveway is to the left of the building.  There are a few spots in the back.  It seems like the gate to the driveway/lot is opened when an employee arrives.  I noticed some people came in groups of 2-3 and had 1 person wait in line while the other waited in the car until the gate was opened.  Then they drove into the lot to park and joined the person in line.  When I came to pick up, I parked in the NFAH lot

- Street Parking on Figueroa - Metered; 1 hr parking from 8a-8p

- Street Parking on side streets - Metered; 2 hr parking (I think I saw these signs on Roselawn Pl and S Ave 56)

- Public Parking Lot behind NFAH - (Pay machine) $2.50 for all day parking from 7a-9p, otherwise $0.25 per 15 mins (I think it was 15 mins, but could be wrong).  Part of the gate/fence that separates this lot from NFAH's private lot is opened during their business hours for easy access!

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE - DETAILED
- Parked in the lot behind NFAH bc I didn't want to worry about the meter
- 6:40a - Got in line. Heeded the advice of another review and brought a camping chair (recommend)
- 7:05a - Line moved forward significantly - I'm guessing an employee opened the gate and started the sign in sheets
- 7:15a - Signed in on Page 4 (Unsure how many pages in total & how many spaces per page (maybe 6-8?)). Sign in info = Owner's Name, Phone Number, Pet's Name, Reason for Visit. There's a bench just a few steps forward that had New/First time Client Forms to fill out and leave in a bin
- Waiting area in driveway - people practiced social distancing. Great time to use your camping chair
- People were getting called in before 8a
- 8:15a - Called into an exam room. The nurse/assistant was super friendly - weighed my dog, asked a few questions
- 8:30a - Doctor discussed reasons for the visit & total cost. Doctor said it was likely she'd be ready to be picked up same day -- if so, I'd get a call around 4 to come between 5-6p for pick up.  If I did not receive a call, I could come the next day around 8-9a to pick her up
-  Another nurse/assistant came in to give my pet "happy juice" and take my dog.  (They told me to keep her leash and collar).  I left to go back home
- 3:15p - Received the call that my dog was ready for pick up between 5-6p.  If I could not make it, I could come the next day at 8a to pick her up
- 5:20p - Arrived & signed in for pick up. Handful of other owners also waiting
- 5:40p - Name called over the speaker to go to the front office to settle the bill, receive documents/records, and get meds.  Went back outside to wait
- 6p - Called into the exam room to pick up my dog<//text>

I'm so pleased with my experience there. I took my pup that has a slight heart murmur to get neutered. I was super nervous and the vet's confidence on top of the loving way he treated my dog had me leave his office with light hearted. The surgery was successful and all staff was super sweet, even under the pressure of having a lot of people in a row. Only tip, get there no later than 7:30am and be prepared to wait for 3 or 4 hours.< /review>

<Text>Yes they are crazy busy (open at 8AM, line starts at 7:30AM, sometimes earlier)..but for a good reason..They only take walk ins (no appointments), they are good at what they do and they get a lot of practice doing critical procedures, they charge fair prices and they care. I've been going here for over 10 years and have brought not only my dogs but also the dogs I fostered and only place I recommend to others who ask for a referral. PS - there is metered parking lot right behind the bldg that you pay kiosk to get a ticket to put inside the front windshield dsahboard.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Wait is usually 1.5-2.5hrs
Open from 8am-10am or≈10:30am during Covid.
Arrive at 7:30am and bring a portable chair to be comfortable and get through with it quicker.
Most street parking around the area is metered 2HR parking for $1/HR

I love Dr. Vasquez. Been going to him many years now. It's a father-son business. Staff is super friendly, and Dr. Vasquez and the vet techs are highly knowledgable and compassionate. Affordable prices. Gets crowded fast, arrive early to sign in. Haven't been since covid-19, but I do hear it's a bit more crowded. 😬 Your pet is in great hands tho, it's worth the wait.< /review>

My family has been coming here for years. Fair prices, friendly staff, clean environment. Wait times can be long but the prices and care are worth it. They really care about animals. They understand that they are family. I have recommended this to extended family and friends and they all come here now too. I don't live in the area but I drive 40 mins to come here. That's how good it is 😊</review>

With the pandemic the staff does a great job allowing for social distance outdoors and even added shade while waiting. They have a very clean facility, great friendly staff and though there's always a huge line they move things along fairly quickly. Just do your best to get there by 8am to get great parking and put your name down. Also amazing pricing! One thing to remember is to bring your pet water as there isn't any provided.< /Review>

This place is honestly great for getting vaccines! Good prices and the service is faster than you think!
However that's everything they're good for unfortunately, any medicines, antibiotics, etc. I've gotten from here have been mediocre at best and at worst haven't had any effect whatsoever! So I suggest you stay clear of that!
Stick to the vaccines only and you should be good< /text>

The doctors and staff are the most kind hearted, understanding people in animal care.  They have helped diagnose and treat many of our pets, and even assisted in helping one of our dogs pass when it was his time.  They work long hours and don't ask for much in return. I highly recommend them, it is worth the wait.<//review>

<review>I've been going to the hospital for two years since I've moved here to LA and the doctor is excellent. I hate putting my service animal to sleep, anesthesia, but since I have to, the doctor and staff at North Figuroa has been lovely and calms my nerves!  Peter Wolf is also my baby and best friend. Worst part about N Figuroa is that they don't take reservations so get there early!!! I have issues getting up so that part has been the hardest they are so popular their line goes around the block!!!!!!!! Five Stars I promise!!!!!!!!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKlLhcOUZ1BVQQVjdMAOKhmEa9rzhrLMM9IFd8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWdLBwuvIo2H11H1u-T03T44txRNPbC7zcokaq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Date>

Best place you can take your pet. There is a long wait time due to the pandemic at the moment. Everyone is very friendly and Dr. Vasquez is very kind and explains everything very well.  It is also very affordable.Highly recommended Animal Hospital. 👍<//text>

I am so grateful to Dr. Vasquez & his team that administered  an extensive surgery that consist of him removing breast cancer from cookie.  I have to admit I have been a complete mess for the last month or so, knowing this procedure was major and I could possibly have lost cookie for good, if this surgery wasn't done immediately.  I arrive at North Figueroa Animal hospital on Tuesday morning with my nerves everywhere, but the moment Dr Vasquez reassured me that "No dog has been lost in his hands", He showed me determination was his goal and that I was too pick up my pet by morning. Honest to God, he lifted every worry and any existing doubt that I had inside my heart. I walked out of there reassured by his confidence that cookie would be fine.  The next day I picked up Cookie and am happy to say she is cancer free. Her recovery process has been rapidly advancing everyday and her spunk has come back like she is herself but ten folds better.  I recommend Dr. Vasquez and his team, to any of your pets challenges and or medical needs. He is an amazing man. Thank you so much North Figueroa Animal hospital, you have no idea how humble and grateful I am for your assistance you have provided for my baby Cookie. You have a major impact in our lives and you don't even realize how bless we have been to have met u.Sincerely Cookies Family</Text>

Prices are excellent, Dr. Is great. But the process to pay and leave needs improvement. Had me waiting almost 2 hours just to pay after my dogs were vaccinated. Ummm... Can I just pay so I can go home?</Text>

<Review>The BEST animal hospital ever!!!! I have been coming here ever since I was a little girl w/her kitten in the 70's/80's in Highland Park.  Back then Mr. Vasquez (Sr.) Joey's Dad took care of my animals😊 Joey is now taking care of my animals and His Expertise and Caring Staff will always keep me coming to bring Salem & Sammy to North Figueroa Animal Hospital for All their veterinary care.
Joey Vasquez and his family are like "FAMILY" to me and my family forever!
Thank You Dr. Vasquez and Staff 🐈🐈from Ally Diosdado & Family & Salem & Sammy🐾🐾😊❤🙋‍♀️<//Review>< Pictures>

It's always a wait but they really manage the crowd well.  Parking is tricky and tough; their lot is small but there is a city one attached to the rear of their lot.  Very good for low cost pet care.</text>

Very responsible rates and the vets have always been taken of. It's nice when u find a place that doesn't take advantage of our hearts when those we love are not well. Yaya cry me a river I know but seriously 4.6 stars out of 600+ reviews that's not something to laugh at. You may have better luck walking in rather than making an appointment.<//text>

Dr. Joey is truly one of the best vets in Los Angeles! His prices are beyond fair. His staff is well trained, he has two people at the front desk, no appointments, you may have to wait a little while. He is caring & you can tell he loves animals. Needless to say I am a fan. Foster, Mugsie & Newman thank yiu❣️< /Review>

We were there for a total of 3 hours, it's a long wait, we went on a Saturday, maybe that's why? They make you wait an extra hour just to pay. The staff  however was very friendly, and as busy as it was we had the veterinarian's and staff undivided attention when we were seen.<//review>

<user>111611038248636419411< /user><Text>So I want to give as much info about my experiences so this will be long. I love this place. I live 20-25 miles away and still come here. There were issues before with being closed with no notice so imagine how frustrating it would be to drive 25 miles in traffic to find out they're away on vacation or at a conference. But they have since fixed that. Their website now usually says if they will be closed when it would normally be open. They have really reasonable prices.

I completely trust Dr Vasquez to tell me the best treatment for my pet. I took my little dog in once because the bigger dog had attacked her. He checked her out, felt her body, asked if I wanted xrays to check for broken ribs. I told him I'd do anything he recommends. He said he didn't think she needed them as he didn't think she had anything broken, just bruising, so I went with that. Any other place would have said from the beginning xrays are needed without even touching or checking her.

I am going to say they are not an emergency facility, which is a crime. It really should be. I think it does upset him when we take our pets to him rather than an er. He really should take it as a huge compliment. I remember answering someone's question somewhere with an experience when my dog died. He was breathing weird. I drove all that way and my dog died 10 minutes before I got there. The vet seemed upset and in my state, I thought he was having an off day or not being sensitive,. But with careful reflection, I realized he was probably upset because I didn't take him to the er. So I can see that. But again, it's a huge compliment to his skill and the trust people have in him. Trust that he'll take care of their pets, and trust that he won't scam you or gouge you. His staff are very knowledgeable as well. Front staff is very professional trying their best to get people in and out as quickly as they can so it's all business cause I'm telling you, they are always swamped. Yet they are still friendly. The techs are very knowledgeable themselves and very helpful.

The only small negative is that he won't see your pet if you've taken them to another vet already. But sometimes you just want a 2nd opinion. He's trying to be respectful though to his colleagues and I get that. So I can't be too mad. Just take your pet to him in the 1st place.....problem solved.

I've had surgeries, teeth cleaning, stomach upsets from eating poop, elderly animals, anemia in a kitten I found...lots of stuff. I recommend NFAH to everyone I know and they have all been very pleased. I have been trying to find a place closer to me with the same or close to the same quality and prices, but I have not so I will continue to come here until I can't anymore.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

The Doctor and staff are all very friendly, helpful, thorough and efficient. Everyone clearly cares deeply about animals. They do not 'nickel and dime' you for everything or charge you increased charges for appts, medicine, x rays or even surgery. We adopted 2 new baby kitties that needed immediate medical care and my regular vet wouldn't give me an appt for a full week. We went there expecting it to be a one time visit but ended up moving our other cat and dog to this vet because of how positive our experience was and continues to be. When one baby became very ill, he reassured our distressed daughter that he would care for the kitty like it was his own. After surgery, he did not charge me for the urgent care cat food or for post op visits, nor was there any hidden fees or extra charges.  I would recommend the North Figueroa Animal Hospital to anyone.</text>

<review>Every day is crowded with people, there dogs and cats. If you have the patient to wait 3 to 4 hours because that's how long it takes for the vet to see your dog and to pay your bill.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

<text>I've taken numerous dogs here over the last few years, as we do a lot of animal rescue. Dr. Vasquez has always been caring and helpful. They do get very very busy here, so don't expect to get a lot of one-on-one time with the doctor, but they provide excellent care, and the pricing is much more reasonable than most other vets. It's awesome to be able to go in with no appointment necessary, and usually see the vet within a half hour or so. I highly recommend them.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Great & affordable place to bring your pet.
It’s nice and clean with lots of room to sit inside and out. Very busy place. My wait time was probably 10minutes and once inside an exam room it was probably 15 minutes. All the employees are very friendly and patient. The only reason there is a long wait is because we needed medication for my dog so had to wait for the medication ( 1 hour 40 minutes) other than that shouldn’t be more than 1 hour or less I guess. I recommend this animal hospital without a doubt!</Text>< pics>

This place is awesome! My kitty, Facehead, had some life and death issues which were terrifying but Dr. Joey and the staff were quick, friendly, and knowledgeable and made me feel at ease. Facehead, is now fully recovered and I could not be more relieved. I will be bringing both my fur babies here from now on!</review>

This is the best Veterinarian Hospital  ever!
My 2 dogs-(wiener dogs) and I were attacked by a pitbull. They suffered terrible deep bite wounds, and one of them had broken ribs. Dr. Vasquez gave them the best care possible, and saved their lives. He is the kindest, most caring, professional, ethical, and amazing Veterinarian I have ever been to. The receptionists are so wonderful, too. I am so grateful for this place. Thank you so much Dr Vasquez, for the love and dedication you gave my babies.<//review>

<date>1589500656843<//date><rate>1< /rate><Review>Horrible experience. Dr Vasquez can’t care less. I waited a over two hours to be seen, then he rushed me! Barely took a look at my dog, ordered bloodwork and walked away. I tried asking him something and he vaguely responded as he walked out the exam room with his back on me. Didn’t even ask for my concerns or told me what could possibly be wrong with my dog. No bedside manners, no compassion. I know it’s busy but we’re waiting and paying to have a consultation, so at least listen and treat ppl and patients with respect. The next day they wanted me to come back to get the results, but the wait was 3 hrs. I told them I had to work, and asked if he could tell me by phone. He said, rushing again,  bloodwork came up normal and suggested antibiotics for potential infection “somewhere”. A few days later I went to another vet because my dog was still not well. Turns out his bloodwork showed elevated enzymes and hormones indicating a severe pancreatitis.... but per Dr vasquez everything was “normal”. Do not go here unless you wanna be treated like another number and get ripped off and lied to.</Review>< Pics>

I love Dr. Vasquez, family and team. Seriously best vet I have ever been to! Caring, affordable and just all around good service. It is always busy. No appointment needed you just check in. Do call for office hours as they close a long lunch for x rays and surgeries. I highly recommend.< /Text>

<Name>Vic Menaskanian<//Name><text>Just all around great Vet. I took my good boy to a Vet closer to my house once simply because they are just a few blocks away. They wanted to do $500 worth of biopsies and whatnot to figure out what the issue with his skin was. I past on that and took him to our normal Vet(Figueroa). It's a ways away from my house and there's usually a line but I'm glad I went because the Vet took just one look and knew exactly what it was. The visit including treatment, pills and everything came to $150. Buddy was better in a week. Best Vet ever!<//text>< Resp>

They're very nice there and get the job done for an affordable price. However you can't make any reservations so you really have to go there to find out how long you need to wait for (I recommend therefore not to go on a weekend! You might end up waiting for 1-2 hours!) also they have specific opening hours, check online or call first. But still my go to vet after all!<//Text>

I needed to get a copy of rabies certificate for my dog. They charge $10 and it was quick.You sign in first and there was a lot of people already waiting for them to open. I suggest you arrive early as parking is small but free.There is a larger parking lot in back but you have to pay.< /text>

<Text>LOVE!  These guys are awesome!  I have been going here for almost 30 years.  Even after the place burned down.... I found my way back for several reasons!  Most of all the actually CARE about  your pets and are kind and considerate of you as their caretaker.  They are also seriously affordable and several times I was sent home without an office visit charge or a discount due to having several animals and/or having purchased my pet through the pound.   Even though they do not take appointments and they are extremely busy, the staff are VERY kind, efficient, and  patient.  I have never had a bad experience here with my 3 cats, one dog, and now a new kitten!  <3  Just be patient and wait your turn.  :)</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pics>

<Review>I'm so happy with North Fig. Animal Hosp. This place has helped me with my dogs and cats. Also, last year I lost my Harmony my cat of 10 yrs to kidney failure, and I was a mess. They accepted his little body, and were very compassionate and respectful toward my need.
God Bless Dr. Vasquez, and his Staff for all their hard work, and professionalism..🌹😃< /Review>< user_id>

<Text>Great place for your fur babies. They take pride in caring for your animals. I do recommend to come early it gets a bit crazy its only walk ins and the sign in sheet goes out at 7am however, I recommend camping out at 5:45am so you can be one of the first ones unless you don't mind waiting 4 to 5 hours. Bring your chairs a book and coffee.< /Text>< pics>

The doctors here are wonderful. They've always taken great care of all of my pets. Very affordable & they don't try to sell extra services. The front desk staff seem proficient, though  slightly dismissive .Always check your paperwork to verify that your personal information is correct. I've made several attempts at having my information corrected and they haven't been able to spell my name correct yet & have an emergency contact on there that I've asked to have removed several times.<//Review>

<Text>Very happy with this place. I called today as a new patient with a very sick cat and they were able to get me in within 15 minutes. Everyone from the front office to the vet techs, and the vet, were extremely caring and kind. They took the time to explain everything to me and gave me very clear directions about what to do with her once I brought her home. My kitty still isn't out of the woods yet unfortunately, but I feel so much better knowing that I have a clear plan and the knowledgeable staff of North Figueroa Animal Hospital only a phone call away to help. Thank you guys!</Text><time>1448620198846</time><user>111210990919551035363< /user></record></dataset><record>

The only thing they need is Saturday spay and neutering by appointment only for those that can't bring in their pets during the week. Overall a great place.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>The staff is wonderful and caring to both clients, pet and owner.  No appointment needed, it is first come first serve.  But the amazing thing is you hardly wait even though the lobby is so full, sometimes you have to wait outside.  The prices are extremely affordable.  Dr. Vasquez, Sr. and his son are knowledgeable and compassionate.  We have 4 cats and 2 dogs, and we go an hour out of our way to get the care they deserve.</review><response>None< /response><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80c2c41a8420c295:0x885ecbce4ee23dd3< /Gmap_id><Name>eric marx</Name>< time>

The best vet I have been to, they always remembers my dog and the staff there are so caring and fast. Usually my wife brings our chuhuahua in and when they came in recognized our dog immediately and were suprised to see me. They are low cost as well and as I spoke to others in the lobby all had good things to say. I highly recommend!<//review>

< review>
Took my 3month Kitty to get neutered & after her surgery we took her home. She felt really uncomfortable with the bandage the vet had her wrapped around her tummy because it was too too tight on her. We realized that the adhesive bandage wrap tape caught her fur (the sticky part) and it was really hard to take it off, like if it was duct tape wrapped around her body, she kept crying while we tried to take off the bandage. This is the first and last time I ever bring her here.< /review>

I didn't want to go to a vet because my dog was refusing to let anyone but me touch her surgery area.

Luckily, I sew and know how to carefully remove stitches and she stayed perfectly still for me so she's okay, but please be more attentive about telling people which stitches were given! I had planned for the disolvables and as I've seen a couple types of "liquid stitches" and what not, I actually thought the stitches that looked like hard string were going to dissolve. Yes I'm an idiot for not using better judgement but I was told they were disolvable so I believed the vet screw me.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I've gone to this place since I got my first dog in 2008. The prices are very reasonable and many times don't charge per preventive visit. It gets crowded but the line moves fast enough, vet and staff are nice, caring and explain things clear enough to understand, fast service but make you feel respected. Work with rescues too. I would totally recommend this place.</Review>

<Text>Great doctor, and vet. techs. The one thing I noticed is this place is usually full of people. Even on a weekday, but they run very smoothly, you don't wait too long. And the doctor is very good at giving you a good explanation of what is going on with your pet.</Text>< pics>

<review>The quality of their work is declining since more people are coming. He used to ask and quickly find the problem with my pet; equal to an okay prince. Today, the doctor kept on asking for test making me spend more money and never found the problem with my pet.

It's awful to invest almost all of my savings  and keep a sick pet.

Plus, the receptionist are really rude they completely ignored me as I was invisible and made me wait over six minutes; while they were infront of me. I had never been treated this way until now.

They are lucky that they have a good location  but I miss the time the doctor's dad was there.< /review>< pics>

What can I say Dr Joey is amazing.  I come all the way from Lancaster. I used to live in L.A. and brought my  dog then, aswell. Because the vets up in Lancaster are crooks and liers, they diagnose my dog with thing he didnt even have I had one Dr. tell me my dog needed surgery when he didnt, there price are astronomical!! But Dr. Joey has  such reasonable prices. Thats why people come from all around. Because just like his father Dr. Joey honest and reasonable.  He care about the animals and the people he  serves. I highly recommend the clinic.</Review>

<Text>I have never been to such a disgusting vet in my life. The vet came in for about 5 minutes, spoke down to me for 4 minutes, told me my cat was dehydrated and needed tests for 1 minute, then gave me other hospitals to go to. He kept saying they needed to run blood tests, but he wouldn't because they wouldn't get the results for a week. He said my cat was dehydrated but didn't hydrate him. Then I left and passed another vet. Unlike NFAH, the vet I passed told me my cat needed to be hydrated and hydrated him. Then, unlike the sad excuse for a vet here, this new vet actually told me my cat was jaundice. The vet here couldn't even bother to tell me my cat was jaundice. If your quality of service goes out the window when you want to get home early, you should reconsider your career.<//Text></record>

<text>I've been taking my pets to North Figueroa Animal Hospital for more than five years, and I'll never go anywhere else (even though I've driven from Culver City and Studio City to get there!). Everyone on staff is considerate and supportive, taking good care of both my pets and me! You won't find more reasonable prices or speedy care (despite not taking appointments). I cannot recommend them highly enough.<//text><time>1409001322958</time><pics>None< /pics></record>

North Figueroa Animal Hospital....it's  been there for sometime..since 80's. Family owned practice. Good quality care...Vetinarian is friendly, caring, and conscious about the needs of your pet. Affordable and reasonable prices....oooh yeah don't forget to look up! The one and only Mr. Chicken is there top restaurant looking down at you. Great place for your pets...NFAH. Chicken classic! Relic from old Downtown L.A. past.< /Review>

I have been taking my pets there for many years, this is one of the best veterinary spots in Highland Park, low cost professional care front and back office, this is why you see long lines at this spot and only a couple people at the other spots, the doctor is now retired but his son has taken over, and is just as good as his dad, very caring and sensitive to your needs and your pet. I give it a 5 star rating< /Text>

They're first come first serve, so you want to get there early, but the price and the quality of care that you will receive is well worth the wait.

Come early on the Saturday at 8am, get there by 7:30am, before they open because its their busiest day and it gets full very quick. His front office and back staff is fast, professional and efficient. North Fig is the most affordable vet in all of Los Angeles, Dr. Vasquez understands the love that his clients have for their animals and gives discounts where he can. :)</review><UserId.>100097140682869757086</UserId.>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Dr. Vasquez and his team are angels!  Everyone we interacted with was friendly, professional, compassionate and efficient.  Our sweet cat was diagnosed with cancer, and Dr. Vasquez took some Xrays and helped us with some recommendations of what steps to take next.  He was able to Xray our somewhat sassy cat without using any anesthetic,  and he was super quick about it.  He compassionately told us we should see a specialist, and within a few minutes the Xrays were burned onto a CD and given to us to take to the specialist.  I appreciate Dr. V and his team so much and would recommend them to anyone!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I would give them a 4.5 (rounded-up). This is a really straightforward veterinary clinic which I take my dog to semi-regularly, whenever she is sick. It is usually quite busy and there can be a bit of a wait, but I trust the veterinarian there and I am happy with the price and the quality of care. I can't vouch for anyone who has a pet with major medical complications or chronic illnesses, but if I needed to I would take my dog in to see how everything works out.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c41a8420c295:0x885ecbce4ee23dd3<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm only posting to warn others with pet emergencies, don't let them trick into taking your pet to another animal hospital. They will recommend you to another hospital, and then that hospital will take advantage, and charge you$600. Dollars, when they are well aware, that your pet will die.< /text>

<Text>When my cat got sick, this place was recommended because of low price. I spent Uber money to get there, and then when their prices were way too high, and they offered no payment assistance, they basically said have  nice day and we left, again via Uber. Then, I went to my neighborhood vet, whose office charge was a bit more, but other services were way less, and they offered to help me if I needed financial assistance. My cat is getting better, I should have gone to the neighborhood vet first.

Update: My cat died.  By the time we got to the neighborhood vet, he was really already too far gone.  If this vet had offered some kind of assistance, other than print outs of two other vet's websites, my cat might still be alive.</Text><user_name>Adrienne Boswell</user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

I brought a neighborhood stray to get fixed there. They were gentle with the animal, kept him overnight to make sure he's okay, gave him antibiotics and supplied me with a week's worth of antibiotics to make sure the cat healed properly. Neutering,  all the shots and antibiotics - ALL FREE ($150 worth). The clinic generally charges less than any I've ever been to. As a result it's always packed, so if you plan to bring your furry baby in for a visit get ready to wait a bit. And definitely make an appointment.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c41a8420c295:0x885ecbce4ee23dd3< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

<Text>If you value your pet's life do not go here. If I could, I would rate this place minus 3 stars! My niece's beloved kitty came here with a blocked bladder. He was in the clinic for over a week. During that time, instead of performing surgery, a catheter was placed, which the kitty took out THEREE TIMES. REALLY?! Never occurred to the 'doctor' to put a cone to prevent removal of the tube. When we called we were just told "he is doing better".  We finally took him to another vet, and when he heard that they had replace a catheter 3 times, he said in shock "What were they thinking?!" Since he had undergone such unprofessional lack of care for such a serious problem, our kitty had to be put to sleep. After Dr. Vasquez Sr. died, this clinic has gone downhill. His son may have a license, but he doesn't know what he is doing.</Text>< Pics>

I took my dog there in dec 2018 his stomach was bloated he had pancreatitis some time before this visit so he lost a lot of weight. He was kept overnight and when I picked him up I was  prescribed a lassix and cecpalixin . They said he had fluid in his chest and infection in his blood. I couldn't tell if the medicine was working , then he started swelling up in his legs and paws , then falling over took him to the emergency he is in critical condition, I had the blood test with me from north figueroa animal hospital and the emergency vet looks at it and right away notices protein is real low and calcium and other things that they should of explained to me when i picked him up. if they would of I could of got supplements for him until we could figure out why the loss of protein. emergency vet wanted $8000 for test and everything and I could only do $2800 after spending $2800 to be told I should put him down. he is home with me now , they said he would die in a day or two he hasn't</Text>

If you have a full grown large dog , 110lbs. DO NOT COME HERE.
I was turned away because the DOCTOR told me he would have to find a large enough table to help my dog. What??
I have a dog not a horse.
I will not waste 1 hour waiting in line ever again here.<//review>

I have been going there since 2003.  They handle feral cats and are about the only vets in LA who do.  Most vets will not service a feral.  The doctors are fantastic and the staff is great.  Plus the prices are low.  I won't go anywhere else.</review>

Customer services can be better and efficient
I literally waited longer to pay than the time I spent with my furbaby and the actual Vet.  I could of walk out without paying...  Of course they would mailed the bill but come on...  Those girls at the front desk need to get their stuff ready< /text>

Rather than say he needed xrays or other expensive tests, the vet said I bet he got scared of the fireworks, jumped weird and pulled a muscle. Let's try him on rimadyl and give it a day or two. If that doesn't help, we'll explore other options. The rimadyl did the trick. Most vets would have insisted on xrays.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>I have been taking my beloved Bella there ever since she was wee puppy back in 2008, & both doctors Sr. & Jr. have been very attentive and helpful to me. I am on a low fixed income, and I don't have pet insurance, and most of the time I've only paid at the most was $100. I had my Bella fixed in January of this year -2014, and I picked her up the very same day. So far I have been happy with the great service they have provided. I will keep taking my dog there for her medical needs, shots, meds, etc.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIMAL HOSPITAL!    AAA+++ SERVICE OVERALL</text>< pics>

The first time I went here it was bc my dog had to get a tooth removed bc it had a cavity and had started to rot. The staff were very friendly and the told me that if I got the tooth removed and got my dog spayed it would be free. I accepted the offer bc I thought it was a good deal. And I was right they got my dog spayed and removed her tooth. I think I have been going here for about 3 or 4 years and it has always been a pleasure to be greeted by the staff and attended by the vet. He is very nice and quick. I now have 2 more dogs and I take all 3 dogs there. The place has very reasonable pricing and I have recommended this place to many people over the years. The only thing I don't like is that there is a lot of ppl on weekends and very little space to sit, but that is understandable considering a lot of people don't have a lot of free time during the week. So if I have any suggestions is to expect a long wait for time of and 1hr to 45min bc there is only 2 or 1 doctors on staff. But don't worry the doctor will only take about 10 minutes with your pet bc he is very professional and good at his job. I have gone to other places and they were very unprofessional not knowing where to inject the pets. But here he is fast and careful not to hurt your pet. IDK if I could say anymore about this place other than it is the best place I have found where they attend you like you and your pet matter. :)</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>we have  three dogs and we have been coming here for about six years now,we have gone to two other vets to try their service and I agree with the other reviews this place is much more affordable .
the main reason we come here is that they get to the point . come early so that you do not have to wait more than an hour .
Blood Work $150
vaccinations for new dog $60.00
the  prices will change over time but I have had good experiences with this place. I have had a Labrador and my parents have two Maltese Poodles.
I reccomend this place ,</text>< Pics>

<Review>I just moved here from Texas and was looking for an affordable vet for my cat who is UTI prone, and a friend recommended this clinic to me. At first I was skeptical because of how busy it was on my first visit (it's walk-in only), but the veterinarian was quick but thorough and very compassionate towards my cat. I thought I was just going in for a checkup, but Dr. Joey found yet another UTI and prescribed an antibiotic injection AND oral medication at no extra charge. I can tell that this vet is really about taking care of their fuzzy clients, and would absolutely recommend this clinic to anyone who is also looking for an affordable veterinarian that will take good care of their companion.</Review>< pics>

It has a courteous staff. But the place is very crowded especially the waiting room and very loud. They need some sort of a system where they call out numbers instead of calling out people's names. I bring my animals here and they are like my family so I recommend it highly.< /text>

For quick shots on a healthy animal I think they're great but anything more NO.
So busy that once you see the vet they are rushed to finish.
Questions are not welcomed and not thoroughly answered.
Staff are friendly and helpful but again rushed.

I got my litter mate pups fixed here and it went fine but then they were itching terribly afterward and my female pup looked like she'd been butchered.
They left all blood on her tummy.
Also, they cones they gave them were WAY to big.

So, not worst vet but if you need extra care and explanation then go elsewhere.
You get what you pay for here.<//Review>

I went there for help because I found a dog on the street. I couldn't keep the dog and the nurse that REFUSE to give me her name slammed the door in my face after she pretty much told me that it was my fault for trying to help the dog to begin with. Horrible experience. Felt like they didn't care about the animal at all</review>

They let dogs die there.they are so inconsiderate and emotionless. I took my dog 2 hours before they close and they didn't even want to see her because they said they were about to close. They suggested just to put her down but I went to another one and they actually helped aand now she's all better.<//review>

If I could give this place zero stars I would. Our shelter dog went here for a simple neutering after we adopted him. Within days we were alarmed because our poor dog’s wound was not healing and was looking worse by the day. We took him to VCA animal hospital 4 days after his original procedure where they flushed his wound and re-stitched it using absorbable stitches and glue (and not staples) and took a swab for a culture. We now found out our dog has MRSA which he most likely got from his neutering. In case you’re not aware MRSA is an antibiotic resistant staph infection that is uncommon in dogs. We are letting the shelter know as well. Do not bring your pets here. A neuter procedure that was supposed to be free (shelter voucher) ended up costing us nearly $1200. They did an awful job and given his tough time post-op, an unhygienic job as well. They also did not have the right size cone for him so they sent him home with a cone that wouldn’t fit over his nose. I’m embarrassed for this vet. He should not still be in business if this is how he handles a simple neutering procedure.< /text>

If you need shots or your animal has a broken bone this is a inexpensive spot. Don't go for anything that needs specialized treatment.</text>

<review>Update: Even though I have lost my beloved Karma😔, I brought my new puppy to Dr.V right away & he will hopefully be Jerry's vet for as long as possible, because I don't think I could find a doctor that is as patient, kind, compassionate & caring as Dr. Joey V. 💙  I definitely recommend!🌸🐾

I really like this place.  It can be a little confusing when you first get there & a lot of people are at the counter. You don't no if your suppose to get in line, check-in, or sign-in or what. Btw- you sign in,  the clip board should be on the counter & then have a set. But their prices are worth it.  The staff is friendly & even though it was packed when I get there I was seen rather quickly & the doctor took the time to explain his findings & answer any questions I may have had.  I use to go to Ambassador Animal Hospital,  but don't care for the doctors (the two that I've seen) bedside manner. Not to mention they try to get you to buy some otc products, which was a waste of money.  So I would definitely recommend NFAH,  because they're the best with caring doctors & staff and low prices. Hope you precious pet is ok 😊</review></record></dataset><record>

My do had a rotting tooth which needed to be removed so I went to go see the prices and they said it would be free if she got spayed.They also send you a card to remind you when your dog needs to be brought back to get their shots and what shots they need.I would recommend.🐶🐕🐩🐾< /text>

This is the closest vet to where i live, but i will gladly drive to santa clarita to see my regular vet from now on. I will NEVER go here again. My dogie had been throwing up (but was otherwise fine, eating and playing and all). The "dr" stuck a thermometer in her butt for 20 seconds (takes 2 mins to get a proper reading, and the "dr" didnt even record it on the file!!! And this is supposed to be a professional service, and im PAYING for it), and he immediately said she had a fever and had to be kept there overnight with an iv (for $175). I refused because she was only throwing up, and i didnt trust that she had a fever (i bought my own thermometer immediately leaving there and monitored her all day, NO NO NNNOOOOO sign of fever!!) I still had them take a urine culture because i suspected a uti. They took her back for less than 5 mins and returned her to me. Later, my husband wanted to know how they got her urine, so i called, and the half brained receptionists couldnt give me a straight answer... whats so confusing? How did they get her urine, simple question right? When i went in to pick up the results, EVERYONE in that office gave me attitude, a new vet helped me, but the vet who originally said she had a fever came into the room for a min to ARGUE with me!!! They are shameless!!!
PLEASE, IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET, DONT TAKE THEM HERE!!! And if you dont care about your pet and do take them here, you dont deserve to be responsible for another life.
I AM FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODAY,  AND I ENCOURAGE OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD TERRIBLE EXPERIENCES HERE TO FILE A COMPLAINT TOO, ITS NOT RIGHT FOR THEM TO BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO HURT PETS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PET OWNERS.<//review>
