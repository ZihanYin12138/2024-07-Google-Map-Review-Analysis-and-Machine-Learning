<text>Great prices and portions. Very friendly, attentive staff 😃🤘 I got the daily special  & my mom got the salmon burger which she enjoyed. My ginger teriyaki chicken was delicious and all other components tasted good. I would go back again for either dine in or take out soon< /text>< pictures>

Teriyaki Don will violate your medical privacy and HIPA law by asking for vaccination history and to show proof of you COVID vaccine and if you are volunteering your medical history they still require you to wear a mask to order food. Even though they are open for dine in and do not require you to have a mask while your eating.<//Review>

<text>Downgraded my review. Patty (whatever her name is) - the shift lead around 4:50pm, does not know customer service and will serve another rather than the person standing right in front of her who was picking up through Door Dash. She had already confirmed my order before she bagged it and made me show it again when I went to grab it. This gave her enough time to serve another. When I tried to call on the phone she tried to play stupid and have me describe the person who I was complaining about (her). When I came in and talked to her about it in person she had attitude.<//text>< Pics>

The food was tasty. When I ordered they messed up the order. And we'll I went back and they didn't even say sorry. They were making it seem like I was wrong which I dont know why they dis that but okay? The girl looked like she was in a rush and didn't really explain things well. But so far the food was good and they gaved us a lot of sauce which I liked. My boyfriend got diarrhea. He says its from this place but of course we dont know. That all I gotta say. Food good. Service. So so.< /review>

<time>1576712407093</time><rating>1<//rating><review>Me and my wife wanted to try something new today...
So we decided on Teriyaki Don in Merced.
Let's start as we entered the place it was nice and clean the cashier really didn't know the menu items.
Food: Teriyaki burger was real dry and had to Drown it in Teriyaki sauce the cut fries taste like they are from CJ'S...
The Teriyaki  Bowl was the worst thing I have eaten in quite a while the chicken was not the best at any means once again had to put almost a hole bottle of sauce just to try and eat it but even then I really didn't even eat it all. The rice was way to sweet almost tasted like rice pudding I would say the only thing I would eat again is the pot stickers for the price I was very disappointed....

Would I eat here again? NO<//review>< Pictures>

The staff is super friendly. They greet everyone who walks through the door. One young girl, who I asked for recommendations, was very friendly and very helpful. The place is very clean and there are many booths to sit at. The place is not noisy at all. I ordered the fried tofu combination which tasted very good. It had white rice, the fried tofu, a small salad, and 2 egg rolls. So much food I couldn't finish!<//Review>

< Review>
This is my first time going to this place since the reviews were mostly positive. However, when I ordered Salmon roll and platter 17 chicken, steak & shrimp. THE CHICKEN WAS PARTLY RAW AND THE SALMON ROLL WAS COOKED! They have not specified or nowhere in the menu that states that the salmon was going to be cooked! The chicken was partly raw and it was disgusting. The staff seemed like they don’t know the food itself. The food was dry and bland. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Yes it’s cheap for the price but I wouldn’t spend a dime for the quality of food here. Go to a real Japanese sushi place other than this. This is NOT A JAPANESE FOOD.< /Review>

<text>We love Teriyaki Don! It is so convenient for lunch! I always give new businesses credit for working out kinks while still serving the public. I have been a new employee before so if you go in and critique every mistake when they havent been open a week is not very fair. After 3-4 months be as hard as you want. I have eaten here a handful of times and love everything I have had thus far. My favorite is the spicy chicken salad! Yummy!!! And the prices are so affordable for a quick lunch!</text>< Time>

Sitting here right now and only one order came out. There are at least 5 people cooking and everything else is getting out. Chef's can't get anything right. Take out orders are being taken of. People after us are getting partial orders.  I am not coming here again unless you can get your chef's in check. I do not recommend. Worst experience I ever had. We barely got the last meal. We didn't eat at the same time and not even close< /Text>

The prdering space is difficult and small, especially if you walk in not already knowing what you want or are a first time customer. The food was plated nicely but the meat was soft and fake feeling. Our orders came quickly and staff was nice. I doubt we'll go back.< /Text>

When we walked in, we were greeted and thought this place was good. The prices were okay with 5.50 for a tuna roll. When the tuna roll arrived, it was as small as an eyeball. The roll was bland. When the salmon roll came the roll was big. Everytime we picked it up, it just broke apart and was bland. We had to get our own water and the worst part was that the water didn't even taste like water. Did not like the dressing and it tasted like mayo. The fried calamari was crunchy but the calamari was soft with the texture of tofu. The best part was the steak, it was juicy and actually had flavour. Overall probably will not come back.<//Review>

Don't waste your time or money. This is the worst version of Japanese "fast" food. The whole family ordered something different. The tempura shrimp was soggy. The teriyaki chicken and steak dry as hell. And when the woman taking orders told the boy at the grill to cook the steaks medium rare he made a face a rolled his eyes. Yes, you can see the entire kitchen staff from anywhere in the restaurant. My guess is that people who don't know the difference won't mind the sub par food. We were excited that something new had opened up in Merced. Huge disappointment😞<//Review>

<Review>So we went for lunch and the flavor wasn't bad and the prices were decent. However, the lady taking our order didn't even bother telling us about the daily specials she just asked if we wanted free miso soup. We didn't even see the specials until after we paid because the sign was on the long end past the counter, past the register. What equally upset me was we did order something that was on the special menu, but since we were looking up at the menu and not directly at the hidden specials sign, she charged us full price. When we finally walked past the specials sign and noticed what we ordered was on special, she looked right at us. She didn't offer to substitute something for us overpaying or offer to give us the difference. We just nodded our heads and sat down.

As you can see from my pictures the salmon roll was odd. They put cooked salmon inside a salmon sushi roll...lol. it was strange enough that my 3 kids winced at it. They are used to seeing it uncooked. The flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I will not order it again thats for sure.

The ginger beef dish was really good and we loved the to go containers they serve their food in. It's super convenient!!!

This place is decent for cheap college students who can't afford actual good sushi or higher end Japanese restaurants.  Its like....a Japanese fast food place, all about the amount of people coming in and not about the quality. But for a quick bite, fairly inexpensive, and not expecting high standards, this place is will do.</Review>< date>

Good prices, good service, but the food was not very good. Ordered the chicken and steak teriyaki. Chicken teriyaki was ok. The steak teriyaki was really tough and had a jerky texture to it. I had to drown the meats in teriyaki sauce to mask the blandness. The food tasted like the frozen teriyaki bowls you’d find at a grocery store. Tbh, those bowls probably taste better. The side salad/veggies that accompanies also has a frozen food flavor to it. Miso soup also tasted very salty and processed. Overall, gave it two stars for the favorable things listed but will not be returning again.</Text>

<review>Great food in a pleasant place.  Our server was very courteous.  I was also a big fan of the refried beans they served along with the traditional salsa and chips.

The food cost about $5 more than I usually pay at similar restaurants, but that wouldn't be enough to keep me from going back.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTGUl64pmHqlJUbCRajkNlXoyOZqFbiSbX3oxT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Date>1535784308531< /Date><response>None<//response>< rating>

If you look at the picture of the tamale sauce it does not look appetizing at all. Service were really friendly though.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Delicous. Husband gave up meat for lent and I'm a vegetarian so we ordered fajita taco salads with just beans. The waiter was nice enough to ask the cooks to add on the carmalized fajita veggies and not charge us for regular fajita salads since the expense is for meat we're not eating. The food was exceptionally good. Their house salsa was the best Ive had and the decorations in the restaurant are lovely. If I lived in redding I'd come often.< /Text>< response>

<Text>Comically bad Mexican food. Elementary school-cafeteria quality. Cheap ingredients. Their burritos look like something a 5 year old would construct during “cooking with mom” night. Bland. Cheap greasy cheese. We literally laughed the entire to-go meal about how bad everything is....this IS your one-stop shop for your worst Mexican food experience. So bad.< /Text>< pictures>

Authentic Mexican food.  They serve you chips and salsa with refried beans.  And they have the best blended margaritas ! Large proportions.  Tasty food.

They serve generous portions, but it is worth it to indulge!  Sharing the combo steak and chicken fajitas is enough for two. Chile relleno, delicious. Don't forget the margaritas served, again, generously in an extra large glass.<//text>

Good service, and good atmosphere, that make the good (not great) food taste much better. Love the furniture, and decorations. Food items are well priced as well.</Review>

<text>When we showed up they were very busy and we still didn't have to wait long to be seated. The service was wonderful and the food was great! The margaritas are huge and come with a follow up tequila shot! My first time dining there and definitely not my last👍<//text><Date>1575736105965< /Date>< Rating>

I had originally written a great review but, am now updating because, I started experiencing very bad stomach cramping and diarrhea. My son is experiencing the same symptoms as well. We had dinner there last night and are still sick today. Will never eat here again and definitely do not recommend</review>

I was kind of blown away tonight. Arrived after closing. My boyfriend and I stayed in the parking lot to search for another restaurant when one of the staff came out. They said that they were closed, but they had a table that hadn't received their meal yet and invited us in. Let's just say....service, food, atmosphere, you name it, TOP NOTCH!!!! Cannot describe just how delighted we were! Thank you, and we will definitely make this a regular spot!😊😊😊<//Review>

<Text>It was a real joy to spend Bryce's 21st birthday which was October 2nd,, The crew took great care of everyone in Bryce's party. They even supplied some extra birthday slammers for everyone..
a wonderful place to go and have chips and salsa with your family and friends !!!

<Text>I love the colorful decor in this restaurant. Service was great. Good was good but not as good as I've had. Missing that rich saucy flavor I love about Mexican food. I'm sure it was just this day and normally it's better. Over so a nice lunch experience.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Okay, this place was just Awesome!! The food is delicious!! The service was fantastic!! It made the night out with the family just a great time!! It seemed we were catered to. Didnt really have to ask for anything or if we did it was quickly responded to. It can seem to be a tad expensive, but so worth the price for the service along with great food!! I highly recommend giving them a try!!< /text>

Got a combination plate to go. They don't bother to separate the taco from the rest of the items so you get a soggy taco that you can't pick up and eat.<//Text>

The food was at a great price. 4 adults 2 kids for birthday dinner was just about 60.00.. amazing. Food tasted good a little better than the medium.. not great!! Tasting but far from bad. It was clean most eveyone was friendly.  Aver all wish i could give more stars but... we had the worst server. Others helped us and asked their tabkes ifthey wanted more to drink etc, but nit ours he hid out most of the time. We were a party of 15 ppl and we were ALL done and bored before we could pay and it took me getting up goin over and waiting and waiting before i could ask if we would get checks soon cuz wed really like to go home tonight. Eeerrr. So other than him good good good</review>

<username>Denise Grannis< /username><Time>1580836765088</Time><rate>1</rate><Review>Went there to eat an hour before an event we were going to (across the street from restaurant), wasn't crowded so we thought we would be ok. We thought wrong. Drinks came in an ok amount of time, food took just over 30 minutes. After the food came we realized we didn't have silverware, that took another 5 minutes to get. In the almost hour we were there no one offered to refill our drinks.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d2ed04c736109d:0x7f9769b0cf11e3a</Gmap_id></record>

<review>We go almost every Sunday after church with the our kids and have some awesome food and enjoy having Bryan waiting on us. He is so professional and fast on service. We recommend the beef  enchilada plate and camarones mexicanos. The kids get nice portions and have tried almost every meal on the kids menu. Also kids menu items are 99cents on sundays. You also get chips, salsa, and refried beans with tasty white cheese for an appetizer and end the meal with a sweet desert. We got churos and vanilla ice cream last time we went. Go see Bryan and the gang and have a great meal on sundays.< /review><gmap_id>0x54d2ed04c736109d:0x7f9769b0cf11e3a< /gmap_id>< pictures>

<review>Went with a large group and there were two other large groups already. We were accommodated immediately and service was great and quick. The servers teamed up on each table serving everyone quickly. The food came out faster than expected and it was all good. Not one of us had a single error or issue.<//review>< pictures>

Delicious... The meat was tender and not dried out. It was so yummy. They were very accommodating to my desires of wanting a salad instead of rice and beans. Amazing meal and I couldn't even eat it all. I would go back again.< /Text>

<review>I really enjoy this place. Food is great, it's clean & the employees are friendly & fun. The main reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they do not have beer on tap. Most good mexican food restaurants have a nice selection of beers on tap🍺🍻< /review>< gmap_id>

Very torn on how to rate this. The place is not clean. It's in such great need of a thorough cleaning. The bathroom floors were so sticky I almost stuck to them. The food was ok. The avocado they put on my tacos was old and looked not good. The carne asada mean was good though.< /text>

<text>The food was great, I had the large combination plate #29 a chimichanga and an enchilada. We got chips and salsa and even a side of beans and cheese with our chips. The atmosphere was festive and the tequila was flowing . It was a little loud for my taste, but that is a matter of personal preference. I will go back.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Nice Mexican Restaurant.  The best I have tried in Redding. I had the chili relleno and taco. I thought both were delicious.  My husband had the carne asada burrito and did not enjoy his meal as much.  The waitress was very efficient and friendly.  The atmosphere was kind of dark so I couldn't judge the cleanliness.</text>< pics>

The service is impeccable, they are: Friendly, Courteous, Prompt and Eager to Please.
The food is always: Fresh, Hot and Tasty.
They have all the Mexican food classics. Children are welcome. They love to host a birthday dinner for any age. Their drinks are also excellent.
The Camarones Mexicanos are so good I have a hard time ordering anything else, and a Tequila Popper always goes well with the bill.
This is always the first restaurant in Redding that I recommend.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

One of my favorite places usually but my go to meal was different, too many onions cutting back on meat and my husband got the end of the avacodo steam in his food and hurt his tooth and it looked like his tooth when he took it out. Thankfully it wasnt and accidents do happen but this wasnt the first time that we had something in our food that didnt belong</Text>

I did my research and decided this studio was one i wanted to join. I have asthma, and typically hotter yoga classes are tough for me. I explained my situation to the owner and she allowed me to try a couple classes to see how it went. The class was so incredible. Joining this studio and would recommend to anyone. 🙏🏼</review></record></dataset><record>

Friendly staff and calm environment. The showers, cubbies and dressing rooms are well kept. I love that they have a hydration station and you can rent a mat for $5 if you forget yours (first time its free!). I also really enjoy the fact that they provide yoga blocks if you need them at no additional cost. I absolutely love this place! 💛<//review>

I've been going to Solfire since it opened almost 5 years ago and I cannot say enough about how amazing this studio is. Everyone there is warm, friendly, compassionate and understanding. Not to mention they have some of the best instructors teaching there!< /review>

This is my favorite local yoga studio. The environment is very chill, grounded and the instructors are supportive. There are other yoga studios in Midtown that feel pretentious, cult-y...this is not one of those studios. I love this place.

For more rigorous classes, choose these instructors: Blake, Jany, Rachel, Janna, Evey and Stephanie.
For more strength building, choose these instructors: Jamie, Taylor, Ellen and Amanda.

Every instructor is unique...some classes I will burn 300 calories, others I only burn 150. Keep that in mind...every class is different, week to week!

I love this place so much.< /review>

Great class and I felt so respected when I honored my body by going into child’s pose.
No sense of feeling like I had to do more.
It was lovely & I still got a great workout!!<//Review>

<text>The restorative classes are the best I've experienced!  Teachers are calming and kind, and I always leave feeling a sense of peace and very, very relaxed.  The studio is very welcoming but it is a bit on the warmer side.

My favorite class and teacher is Vin on Tuesday evenings.  Blake not only adds knowledge and instruction but soulfulness and laughter to his classes.  I'm hooked!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I loved the little affirmation card that was slipped into my purse during the yoga sesh :) I also love the warmth and inviting nature of the place. I was in a moderate class with some seriously talented yogis, and I still felt welcomed and encouraged despite being a bit rusty and out of my practice, with a shoulder cuff injury, nonetheless. I can't believe it took me so long to make it to Solfire. I will be back with regularity.</text>

<text>I love everything about Solfire- the space, the art, the people, the classes, the workshops, the merchandise, and the discounts for teachers and public servants. I also like that they offer different types of classes in the Harmony studio. I first visited Solfire to check out a Kundalini class and was intrigued by the cool vibe in the main studio. I never thought I would practice hot yoga again, but now I’m hooked. I especially love 60 minute classes.<//text></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>It’s wonderful. The staff, teachers, and classes are awesome. I had never done yoga in a guided class before. So, naturally, I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d literally be able to handle the heat (of their Vinyasa classes) or keep up with the double zeros. They make you feel comfortable. They also challenge you but reiterate that it’s about going at your own pace. I was initially wary too since I have a permanent hip injury. The teachers are more than happy to provide modifications if need be. I like that they practice what they preach. If you’re wary, like I was, start with their $30 for 30 days (keep in mind it’s consecutive). They have lots of classes to choose from, hot and regular. I am no longer wary and now an unlimited monthly member! Not only will you make Yoga practice a part of your daily routine but also your lifestyle. Granted, it’s an expensive hobby but it’s definitely worth it for your mental and physical health. There are few things in life that give you what you truly need; a healthy body (and heart) and happy mind. And I’d recommend Solfire yoga as one of the few.< /text>< pictures>

Solfire truly is a place of inclusivity for everybody and every body. I've practiced at the studio for two years and would never want to take class anywhere else. It's not just the yoga, it's our wonderful and diverse community. We welcome, support, and most importantly celebrate each other. Come flow with us!</Text>

The studio was open and clean. Staff was friendly and very helpful while setting me up for my first class at Solfire. The class "vinyasa power basics" and the instructor Steph were great. It was challenging, but not overwhelming for a semi-newbie.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I like the fact your community offers classes like Kundalini Yoga, Yin, and Nidra. I find those classes more difficult to access in other studios in Sacramento.  These classes offer great variety for people who get stuck in energy patterns and who are overly structured. I also like that your studio has a private meditation room with bowls and oracle cards. I do not know of any other studio that has that. The quotes that you leave on our shoes are also a great idea because it is an opportunity for people to leave the class with the sense of accomplishment and good luck. The Karma yoga (selfless service volunteering) is also a great system for people who are willing and capable to contribute to the community with the best of their abilities.All in all, solfire yoga is a great place to practice yogic techniques and are open to people who face difficulties with life.<//Review>< pictures>

Fantastic. Nice character smile to round off a beautiful crepe. Not just the appearance is great but also the taste. Yummy, can't help but I guess I'll always come back for more flavors. Highly recommended!<//text>

<Review>What a cutie crepe, I feel like that I just wanna stare at it the moment its handed to me, so cuteee! But I realized it'll melt if I didn't.
Taste is awesome, delicious, sweet and chewy. Can't wait to come back again then try another flavor. Highly recommended!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE-_wJv6-wnF1-6jJ2jgTjeM7n40nv--L8TYNE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<review>Time after time, Belly Good never fails to impress me! There is almost always only one person in the stall, and the staff is always professional and courteous, regardless of how busy they are. Very reasonably priced with great flavor combinations! I always stop by when I am in San Francisco!!<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I ordered two drinks which I believe were mango with boba and peach with lychee and I also got two crepes. The drinks and the crepes were delicious! Also we were given ice cream on our crepes and we were told it was on them which was such a nice gesture. Will definitely be back there! The employees were very welcoming and polite.</Review>

It's always a pleasure to come here! Whenever I visit San Francisco or show people around there, this is near the top of places to go.
The faces they make on the crepes are unique and adorable, and the variety of crepe flavors are affordable and delicious. This restaurant is definitely a little treasure!< /review>

Actually is 3 1/2 star, not so clean the place. Staffs very friendly and the crepes very funny funny when you ask wrapped. They make bear or other animal cute face. They only accept cash.<//Text>

< Review>
I've tried many crepes in the city so there is a list I can compare the quality of the crepes here. I don't care much for the designs they make on the crepe but they are pretty impressive. They put way too much whip cream and it was a little too soggy with the ice cream. They should of cooked the base of the crepe a little more.<//Review>

Love their ice cream crepes. Got it when we were dating, got it when we just had a baby, and got it with our kid. They have never disappointed us.</Review>

<Text>It's always a pleasure to come here! Whenever I visit San Francisco or show people around there, this is near the top of places to go.
The faces they make on the crepes are unique and adorable, and the variety of crepe flavors are affordable and delicious. This restaurant is definitely a little treasure!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN341pwfrsEEtPRyzomHL3UnFvTPfMtC0kXvW6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>{'time': 1604126041330, 'text': 'Thank you very much.\nPlease come again.\nHappy Halloween 🎃'}<//response><gmapID>0x808580b8d7c745a3:0x8575070506231f69<//gmapID></record>

< review>
I'm a big fan of Belly Good crepes over the more touristy Sophie's crepe on the other side of Japan town.

Belly Good reminds me of authentic Japanese crepes from Harajuku. Soft and chewy with great toppings inside. I always opt for getting ice cream as well as a finishing touch. And they always top the ice cream with a silly face that's totally Snapchat or photo worthy.<//review>

Wanted to try a different crepe in this area and choose this one for the cute presentation. Ordered a custom crepe:

Expresso ice cream with chocolate sauce, pudding, custard and whipped cream. Original crepe batter (optional green tea)

Every ingredient was delicious. It had a large amount of whipped cream but it helped balance out the sweetness of the ice cream. The chocolate sauce had small bits of chocolate which greatly helped the texture of the crepe since we ordered all soft ingredients.

There's only 3 tables in the storefront but there are plenty of seats throughout the mall.

Tip: You always need whipped cream. I thank the worker for asking us. CASH ONLY<//review>

A small shop located inside Japantown. They make cute and tasty crepes with faces on them, and have a great assortment of crepes such as Oreo to matcha cheesecake.< /Text>

the crêpes were delicious and super cute!! we got the green tea special and the oreo special. the staff was very friendly and efficient despite working alone (when we were there. dunno if there's multiple workers during its busier hours) would recommend! only giving 4 stars since we didn't try their boba drinks ><</Review>

<Text>A unique little find, tucked away in a shopping mall in Japantown.  Offering both sweet and savory crepes you will find a wide array of options however, there are numerous menu boards and confusing signs that will leave you a little confused until you start ordering.

We ordered a mixture of savory and sweet and waited and waited until our number was called.  a crepe of salmon and cream cheese for me and a crepe with ice cream for my kiddo and both were gr-iz-ate.

They even made the little bears on my son's ice cream which he got a kick out of.< /Text>< pictures>

Staff is super insistent about you having your number even if you're the only one who's ordered in the last 15 minutes.  I have to assume that's management's fault.  The faces are cute and the crepes are tasty, anyways.< /review>

A hidden gem inside the Japan Town Center.... What makes this little dessert place stand out are the artistic creations decorated on top of simple scoops of Ice cream and dessert crepes.  They also dry their own sliced strawberries, to add as toppings and for decorations.  The family that runs this little shop are very nice and helpful ... Service with a smile!!</text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>This place really does make you feel like a kid again. The way these people make their crepes look with the cute characters made of whipped cream, ice cream, cereal, and such just makes me happy. I brought my friend from Santa Barbara here and she loved the boba here. It was her first time and she got lychee boba and she loved it. If you’re going anywhere here, make sure to visit here, nippon-ya, and the chocolate chair. This place is a must!<//Review><time>1508305120907< /time>< Response>

<review>I only came here to pay $8 a crepe because I love novelty food, anything cute, sugar, and well, crepes and ice cream. TBH, I feel like I could stick a couple of colored corn chips and a marshmallow on a scoop of ice cream and call it a bear. Or a dog. Or elephant...

In reality, I wouldn't really buy a whole bag of chips to make one dessert and I sure don't have a crepe stove at home. The verdict - they were actually really good. I like the crepe part which was soft and chewy, and the ice cream (I chose vanilla) was really good too. I tired the green and it tasted natural and not artificial.

Overall, as much as I would like to make fun of this place, it's actually really good and cute as well. I'm such a sucker for cute and sweet foods

<Review>I've been coming here regularly for over a decade. My main order: green tea boba. I've ordered the crepes before too and am always blown away. It has had the same owner for at least 15 years and their prices have (relatively) stayed the same since opening. There is often a long line and very limited seating, but trust me, you won't be disappointed.< /Review>< Pics>

Amazing ice cream served in a crepe. Only problem is that they only take cash, but staff is very helpful<//Text>

<text>Always wonder what this place was like so we finally tried it after 10 years of first seeing it.  Food comes out fairly quickly and prices were fair.  Crepes are of lower quality compared to other shops in the area.  The crepe feels cheap, as well as the ingredients.  Fruits are sparse and whip cream felt oily and unhealthy.  They make very cute designs on their whip cream of animals.  Seating is limited.<//text>< pics>

My favorite crepe place! Not only are they delicious and have adorable little faces, but this place has been open since I can remember. It's cash only (~$6-7), so keep that in mind, but worth it. They're usually busy, but also quick about getting orders out. Like most crepe places, you can watch them make it.<//Review>

Being a tourist, my friend agreed to take me here after dinner. The concept of make a crepe cone and creating a bear out of the ingredients is so cute! I am a sucker for sweets and cute things. If I am ever in SF again, I will want to go back and try something different.< /review>

Sophie's Crepes usually has too long of a wait, so this place another great option. The wait here is never too bad, even if there's a line. Unlike Sophie's Crepes, the crepes at Belly Good are softer. There's also a lot of options for making custom crepes, but their premade ones are extremely delicious as well! They're known for their "happy face" crepes--which essentially means they'll make some kind of adorable sculpture out of the ice cream on your crepe. Always puts a smile to my face. :)< /review>

<Review>This is, by far, my favorite crepe restaurant in SF.   The crepes have the perfect consistency and texture - and they are delicious!  They use Double Rainbow ice cream and real whipped cream - yum!

Located in the Japantown mall, this place is staffed by very friendly people who seem to really enjoy their jobs.  Each crepe that comes out has a unique design which is always cute and loved by both children and adults.</Review><username>Chris Shellenbarger<//username><resp>None< /resp><date>1468335955605<//date>< Rate>

Delicious crepe. We ordered 3 crepes. Even 2 of them has the exact same flavor, they were decorated differently - one of which is a bear, the other one is a panda.
(The attendant, or maybe the owner, is Japanese.)<//review>

When we want crepes and Sophie's line is out the door, we come here.  There's still a line most of the time during the weekends, but they get through the line quickly.  The service here is friendly.  My daughter love that they made her a crepe teddy bear one time.</Text>

Sooo cute. I think the crepes are good (not mind-blowing) but it's fun getting a crepe with a cute animal face on it. I got a strawberry cheesecake ice cream with whipped cream and a red bean add-on. The red bean was a bad idea and didn't meld.

The crepe itself is soft and chewy, which I really liked but I understand that others prefer a crispy crepe. It held up well, even after eating for a while - instead of getting my hands very sticky.

All in all, the face was adorable and made me smile but I kind of wish I had gotten the face-less banana and cream cheese crepe that they had on the menu. Next time!< /text>

I can't think of a single complaint about this place. The crepes were as delicious as they were cute, and man were they cute. I got the Oreo Special, which was really good. They offer plenty of flavors and toppings. Surprisingly, the lines weren't as long as I thought it would be for a place like this.<//Text>

These crepes are almost too cute to eat! No matter which one you pick, the staff uses ice cream and toppings to decorate your crepe with a little pig, bear, frog, etc. They are adorable and more importantly delicious. There's a variety of toppings and prices are reasonable.

It's located in the Japantown shopping center where there are lots of good restaurants and stores.<//Text>

I came here since I was a kid and I always love it.

They're best known for the crepes and have a ton of options.
The crepes not only look cute- can be designed into a bear but, are great to eat as well!

The ice cream is very tasty, especially the mochi ice-cream. Every serving of regular ice-cream comes with a cute face. The price is very decent, we got to orders of mochi and two single ice-cream orders for 10 dlls. The staff is very nice and the service is fast. There is a table in case you want to eat there and there are benches throughout the mall. Also, you can enjoy the ice cream while taking a walk through Japan Town mall center.</text>

<text>The happy face crepes are filled with a bit too much whipped cream for my liking, so it was a 3 star crepe. The adorable happy face is totally worth a star though. :)< /text>< pics>

Amazing ice cream.
Great style of crepe ice cream cone with adorable animals made out of toppings.
Totally worth it.
Strawberry cheesecake icecream with strawberries and nutella was bomb.< /Text>

How cute are these crepes!!!

Honestly, the only lure that got me to come here was because I saw how they decorate their crepes (CUTENESS OVER TASTE...at least in the IG world hahaha) but luckily the taste did not disappoint!!

The crepe was soft and the ingredients were fresh! I liked how it wasn't overly sweet, a big plus for me!

And as many people stated before, CASH ONLY!< /Text>

Come here if you want to instagram/snapchat/(add other social media) a picture of an adorable animal-shaped ice cream crepe. For a little over $5, you get a crepe with ice cream flavor + sauce of your choice adorned with other toppings to create an overly-cute animal face.

I got a green tea bear with marshmallow snout and fruit loop ears, and paired my ice cream with honey (one of my favorite combos is gt + honey). The crepe was warm, fresh and delicious, and all of the ingredients generally balanced well to make a not overly-sweet dessert. Other toppings such as fruit, having a green tea flavor batter, and sweets will run you a little extra, but they have tons of customization options. My simple crepe was still quite solid, and recommended as a photo-op and snack while taking a break from shopping in Japantown.< /review>

They loved the kawaii-ness of the crepe but was also surprised that the ice cream itself was good too. They almost did not want to eat it because it was too cute. They had the vanilla and green tea ice cream while I had the strawberry cheesecake one. They're all really creamy and good. The strawberry cheesecake actually had pieces of cheesecake in it. The line relatively goes by quickly and you get your stuff in good time as well. I think it was worth it if you're around Japantown.<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Another ideal place for gourmets!
Belly Good Cafe & Crepes offers pancakes that can be brought to life by giving them a cutest Kawai look!
But do not trust their commercial aspect, these pancakes are prepared with the Japanese method and offer a really fine texture! You just have to choose your favorite ice cream and before!

Not saying put employees or one self in the line of getting hurt, but when a customer is verbally attacking another customer call security. What he does is tell the customer who was being attacked to leave the store and said little to nothing to the customer who was disturbing the store.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

The in store service was excellent, but online for the store needs to be updated concerning the products in the store frequently. What's said to be in the store online can be false like today, but luckily a team member was able to locate them item at a different location and ordered it for me.</Review>

Went just day's before X-mas, selection was slimmer than usual, but that's not their fault.  Staff was a little annoying as someone asked if I needed any help like literally every 2 minutes, but the positive is that they were happy I was there and I could have gotten help at any given moment.  I'm glad they were able to stay open and be well staffed.  5 Stars Earned</review>

<username>Jason Christensen</username><Review>Worst service ever. No one greets you in. If you come in wearing sweats and converse they will downplay what you wear and up play their shoes even though they are sold out and you can’t buy them. If you come in with expensive shoes the employees get jealous and talk about you behind your back.<//Review><gmapID>0x809ada1936445edd:0x8d68407b82ab53b9<//gmapID><Rate>1</Rate></record>

The staff are pretty helpful in finding the things you need but I recommend that you check the champs app/site first because they usually only have a select amount or color of shoes. The shoes are displayed simple so there pretty easy to find. Also heads up they run out of larger shoe sizes (10w/10m & up) faster then average shoe sizes.<//review>

Great shoe store. I came in one day looking for a new pair of shoes and they had a pair I absolutely loved at first sight. They even had my shoe size for that pair. Overall, I definitely recommend that place if you're looking for a new pair of shoes.<//text>

<Review>The male dresser’s skill is not bad, above average among K-hair dressers in SJ, but he clearly shows his bad temper in a passive-aggressive way like pushing chairs away with his foot and throwing scissors on the table, which is really disgusting to do to a teenage customer who did nothing wrong to him. $65 for women’s haircut. No tip policy, which is obvious why.< /Review></record>

<text>The stylist Bansuk is so amazing and has exceptional styling skills! He gave me very good advices on how to style my hair and it really worked on me. He is very poise and professional. One of the restaurant servers nearby strongly recommended me to go to him and it was worth every penny. If I could tip him, I would have tipped 100% but he doesn’t accept tips. What a fantastic job he did. I really liked that everyone gets a gown and the people who work there are super nice. I wish Boston had salons like this. I would recommend E# hair to anyone who needs a top notch stylist. Two thumbs up 👍</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>A little pricey but they don't accept tip. Provides quick but nice haircuts for men at least. They're usually fairly booked in advance, though, so you shouldn't expect a walk-in service.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Although there are people that have made negative comments about the owner/stylist, the bottom line is the guy can cut hair. I’ve never once walked out unsatisfied. The only thing I would change if I could is the frequent increases in the price of a men’s haircut, but if you want a high quality cut - E# is the place.<//Text>

He is hands down the best hair style Iever had.  I never had a bad haircut.  Even when my wife was not happy with her coloring, he fixed it the next the day. We have been loyal customer since he opened.</text>

Not worth $45 haircut for mens haircut. I had less crappy or just as crappy hair cut for less than $15. This is coming from a guy who has short hair and don't mind suffering for a week or two until it grows back. I would get my crappy 10 min haircut else where and enjoy little lunch in El Camino then to ever pay that price again here. Extra star for the guy being nice tho 🙄.</review>

<rating>1</rating><Response>None<//Response><Time>1414546287597<//Time><review>The owner is the hairdresser. It is expensive for Haircut ($50). It takes only 15min for haircut. Huh! The biggest problem is the hairdresser makes customers uncomfortable. It is usual for customers to wait (the worst one I have to wait was 35min). In case the customers are late (I was late by 7min one time), he makes face on customers. He got easily angry and grumpy against employees. He cut my dialog with one of employees while she was helping me to sit and setting drying gadget on top of my hair. He call her loud and asked her to stop talking and doing work. I got frustrated. I feel like I was scolded for something I did wrong. It was awful!

With some time of silence I talked back and complained about being mistreated. He confronted me and talked back. He had lots of stuffs to talk to me. He complained that he served the best to me (he said I am one of his VIP customers) simply by providing washed gown and using tissue to sweep away hair from neck and face. These are regulations in hair salon in US! Again it is not a service but THE REGULATION! He also asked me how you were being my customer. How absurd!

This hair shop has lots of violations on Cosmetology regulations.

1. They have to provide washed gown to customers. It should not be reused. Beware! They reuse gown. They put back used gown into the rack with other gown. They said they wash gown once a week.

2. They have to use clean or disposable material to get off hairs from face and neck. Beware!  They use the same used sponge to dust off hair from customer to customer. .

3. They should clean devices before using to other customer. Beware! I've never seen them cleaning devices before using to other customer.

4. They should not use any dropped stuffs without sanitation. Beware! I've seen many times he dropped to the floor and pick up stuffs. Reuse stuffs or put those on tray with other devices.

5. All employees at the shop should have licenses. I am not sure about this.

Even at the hospital the doctor does not treat the patient as the way he treats the customers. I don't recommend this place. I will not go there.<//review><username>New Man</username><user_id>110266645153793511840< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

Great for seasonal items and has good produce the majority of the time. Employees are not that helpful; one time it took the check-out woman 45 mins to exchange 2 items and ring up the rest of my stuff. It only ever got done bc I told her manager how her math was messed up and made sure they got the right amount of money. (She was trying to give me the things back that I had exchanged, plus the new things I wanted instead.) After all that she ended up giving me too much change back. Wow!<//review>

Wish someone didn't put a huge dent in my poor little sun.  If it were a Cadillac, maybe it'd be worth running, but a Lil trailblazer?  Come on!  Shopping center VERY NICE :)</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Love the 99 cent store. I frequently get my sugar fix here. Love the jelly belly bellyflops. They have lots of selections at very reasonable prices for the sweet tooth. I like to purchase my preserves for my toast here also. The apricot jam and blackberry jam are awesome on toasted sourdough bread with a hot cup of coffee. If you know what you want and go right to it you're in and out in no time. There are also several good places to eat.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Nice new Center but too many loud, noicy teenagers hanging around, abusing the public outdoor furniture. Parking spaces are not enough. Forsee this center would be deteriorating rapidly. The prices at B.F. are outrageously and ridiculously high.< /text>< Pics>

The trainers are very friendly & accommodate to your needs. The stretches are very unique & is a great supplement.  I go to the Kearny Mesa location. The only negative is the parking lot can be a bit small but its worth going here though. I always feel a lot better when leaving. Your body is a very valuable investment. So take care of it.</Text>

With knee and hip issues, and working to maintain an active lifestyle, Stretch-U has been a great addition to my routine! I look forward to my sessions, helping me stay flexible and recover from my workouts. It’s absolutely worth it!< /text>

<text>This place is the best! Very effective stretching method, easy to schedule, friendly and professional staff. Great idea if you want to improve athletic/workout performance, or if you are recovering from deconditioning, or simply if you need a stretch. Highly recommend! (PS: Stretch U technique is significantly more effective comparing to Massage Envy stretching sessions, no offence to Massage Envy)< /text>< pics>

My lifts and personal aspirations as an amateur cross fitter are becoming a reality since becoming a regular at StretchU. The scheduling is accommodating and staff make this business feel like home. Thank you making me flexible and giving me the mobility to excel in whatever activities life has to offer.< /text>

<date>1607405251544</date><rating>5< /rating><Text>I found this to be a great way to increase movement and “comfort in my skin” after hours of desk sitting most of my day. I’ve had several different staff, and they were all consistent in their approach and skills, and put me at ease. I augment this with stretching at home to try to improve flexibility, and I’ve noticed that I move more easily and tend to carry less tension in my shoulders. I recommend the approach as a more therapeutic approach than massage, with a little bit of theory a la physical therapy. I should disclose that I’ll get a free session for posting this, though I don’t think it significantly alters my comments.</Text>< Pictures>

My husband received several stretch classes as a gift. After attending the three gift classes he signed up to continue. His hip and overall his joints have been tight and the stretching has helped him to walk better and more upright. He seems to have more flexibility and is very satisfied with StretchU and all of the attendants who have stretched him.<//Review>

I teach multiple fitness & dance classes a week, and the assisted stretch has been such a game changer. I wish I found this place sooner - but now that I have, can't imagine a week without a session. Everyone is very personable and professional. I've been stretched by 5 different people and they've all been amazing! The Kearney Mesa location is very clean, open (doesn't feel crowded and stuffy), and they take the time to wipe down the bed & wash their hands between patients. Masks are mandatory by the patient and the trainers at all times.

Memberships are the way to go & the member price on additional sessions is a steal!

Also awesome to have the option between a 20 or 40 mins session depending on your availability. I always do the 40, but can foresee needed a quick in/out sometime in the future. I also love that you can share your membership - my husband can come in and use a session when he really needs it!

Would HIGHLY recommend StretchU to all my fitness fanatics/instructors who need to level up their recovery game!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I was dubious of the stretching concept outside of a massage but find Nathan and the whole team very intuitive.  I think stretching may actually provide longer term mobility than a massage as well as pain relief.   Thanks for the team of Stretch u</text><date>1611548837192< /date>< rate>

<gmapID>0x80dbffc0470a78c7:0x4d1e2ee4740323fb< /gmapID><text>My dad is a retired PT, so whenever I needed stretching or therapy growing up I could just ask him.  I didn't realize how fortunate I was until I became an adult.  Doctors will prescribe PT, but usually only for an injury.
Over the years, I had developed a knot in my shoulder muscles, and when I took up running again, I found myself sorer now in my 40's, which was never a problem when I was younger.
I tried stretching out muscles on my own, but just wasn't getting a good stretch... that's when my kid's hair stylist told me about Stretch U.  Physical therapy  that I could get w/o needing a RX, just for basic stretching and PT needs.  I signed up for the membership and have been very satisfied.
My therapist, EJ does a great job!  I am feeling more stretched and limber, and my runs aren't leaving me feeling sore and tight.
I highly recommend Stretch U.</text><name>Deborah Cole<//name><Time>1603565476696</Time><Pics>None< /Pics><UserId.>106431013651336624474</UserId.><response>None< /response><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Stretch U has been such a great help in terms of recovery. Working 12-13 hour shifts and exercising on my days off, it's always nice to be able to mobilized in manners to promote adequate blood flow and active recovery. Working with Devon has been nothing short of amazing. This gentlemen is professional, personable, and well versed in his practice. I recommend everyone give them a shot, it's an absolute game changer.<//review>

He did a fantastic job of stretching my muscles specially my injured leg without hurting anything else.
This place is amazing.
If you have an injury or just sore from sport this is a must.
All the therapists are professional and experienced.  The place is clean and organized.  I have reservations to go to therapy offices these days but not this place.

I'm new to the assisted-stretching world, having only received professional massages in the past. The stretching element has been a game-changer for me, improving my flexibility and lower back pain which wasn't really responding to massage alone. Their 40 minute session is the best, as it includes about 20 mins of stretching and 20 mins of deep tissue massage. I have used several practicioners at this facility and they have all been great - all have backgrounds in kinesiology or related fields, so they know their stuff. Highly recommend!<//review>

< Review>
I began coming to StretchU with Darrough in 2018 while training for an Ultra Marathon. My former roommate recommended them for recovery post long runs and I loved it. They no doubt helped me bounce back and recover, releasing all the tightness and working to address muscle soreness and stiffness throughout my training.
Two years later and I'm down almost 150lbs from when I started coming and teaching Yoga and Primal Mobility, so I came back to release the muscle stiffness and Darrough was still there to hook me up.

With going into teaching and soon apprenticing for Yoga, I'm definitely going to be back to get worked on.< /Review>

I have had very little range of motion and standing, sitting and lying down have all been painful.  After a few sessions, I began to gain more range of motion.  They are so careful and skilled to make sure I am not in pain during my sessions.  I love my sessions at Stretch U Kearney Mesa!<//Review>< Time>

I have been having a lot of trouble with both tennis elbow and knee pain, both injuries that happened at work. I have been suffering with sever pain for months and because of COVID I could not get physical therapy through my doctor.

Stretch U is an excellent choice for anyone looked to add assisted stretching to part of their fitness or recovery routine. All of the physical therapists that I've worked with have been excellent and have provided truly therapeutic recovery. If you are feeling sore from sports, working out, or just life in general you should definitely visit Stretch U and take an intro session to find out what it's all about - you won't be sorry that you did!</Review>

My son Christopher had his session with Alexis and he loved the way she stretched and massaged his problem areas. She took the time to asked him questions and then stretched him. He left feeling relaxed and not tight on one side. She was amazing and I recommend that everyone that needs to be stretched book an appointment with Alexis at the Kearney Mesa location.</review>

I can not say enough good things about our experience at Stretch U. Not only are they excellent at stretching but kind and compassionate at the same time! Everyone there has been extremely helpful. Derek stretches my son with Cerebral Palsy and he is so much more than amazing and understanding he is so professional and understanding of my sons disabilities and inability to speak. My son loves going to get stretched now!!! He hated it before but Derek is so awesome with him looks forward to going 2X a week. I’m so thankful for this place and Derek because my son has gotten too big for me to move anymore and stretching is the most important thing for his long term health.< /Text>

<Review>So far I have had 5 stretch sessions. I have been concentrating on my lower body and am working on loosening up my hips. Stretch U has been great in helping me achieve my goals. It has helped me improve my Pickleball game.
In fact, two of my Pickleball partners commented to me that there was a noticeable improvement in my game since I started my stretch sessions.
I enjoyed all my sessions and the people working on me have been great!

I am a certified massage therapist and I think everyone would benefit by including Stretch U in their self care plan. I started last December taking my 15 year old son for his tight hamstrings. I wanted him to avoid injuries and improve his range of motion. I observed the great technique and breadth of knowledge exhibited by the staff and decided to try it for myself. I signed up for the 40 minute stretch and found I also could benefit from assisted stretching. We are considering a monthly membership because it’s so relaxing and beneficial to experience even the 20 minute stretch. Definitely worth the short drive from
Downtown to Kearney Mesa!< /review>

I teach fitness and I was struggling with finding time to properly stretch and give my body the recovery needs to perform at it's best so this has been a really great fit for me.

There's plenty to parking and the staff is super friendly and really take the time to explain everything during their first intro session.

I live DT so I try to fit my appts in to avoid traffic coming back but it's easy since they offer a wide range of times every day.<//review>< UserId.>

<text>I have been to StretchU 5 times now. I will admit, the first time I went I was very skeptical as to the benefits of being stretched. I had to complete an assessment my first visit and I set my goals to be focused around improved flexibility. Devon was fantastic as he explained the different stretches and what they were doing for me. I felt incredibly relaxed throughout the process and my body released quite a bit of tension. 100% stand behind the staff here, and I will continue coming in.</text>< Time>

I had always been intrigued by the idea of a stretch therapy session. I read the reviews here and was skeptical because people talked about being cured of pain. I thought might as well just try and see. Won't hurt to give it a shot.

My appointment with Derrick was great. He explained everything and made sure pressure was good. After I felt great but was wondering if the relief from my chronic low back pain would last. I've had massages before and the relief only lasts a day or two then pain comes back.

A week later I still felt AMAZING and the best I had felt in years. Not exaggerating when I say this place worked wonders on me. I'm a wedding photographer and had so much pain by hour 3-4 and now that I visit twice a month, I can get through hour 8 with almost no pain. It's incredible. I thought I'd always be in pain but no more

That first visit seemed to cure my pain and now I just go as maintenance and a sort of prevention of extremely tight muscles. I workout several times a week (now with no back pain holding me back!!!) and these visits really help me stay loose and able to progress through my workouts.

I highly recommend stretch u to anybody who has tried other methods of pain relief, especially pain of unknown origin. It works wonders for me and I will keep going in for the foreseeable future!!</review>

<review>Just had my first stretch with Kylie! I had no idea how beneficial a session would be as I’ve just gotten back into a consistent fitness routine and have been dealing with joint pain and really tight muscle groups. She was very professional as were the other employees that were assisting other customers. It’s a cool vibe in there and the staff is very knowledgeable. I think these stretch sessions are more beneficial than massages! Thank you, I’ll be telling my friends and family about your company!</review>< Response>

<Review>I can't say enough good things about this place. I teach Jazzercise classes and social dance salsa/bachata every week. My legs would be so sore and I couldn't find any relief until I started my weekly stretch appts. My whole body thanks me for letting these amazing people work out those tight muscles with stretching.  Add in the Lock and Stretch and you're going to find how much your body needed this treatment.  You don't know until you know!</Review>< Pictures>

Stretch U in San Diego is a nice facility and friendly staff. Dowan is great and makes my husband and me feel at ease. I always feel more flexible after each session; the deep stretches helps release the tightness around my hips and knees from sitting too long at my job. Thanks Dowan!< /Text>

The San Marcos location is a bit far for me, but luckily they have two locations near me - Kearny Mesa & Rancho Bernardo.  In my own experience, StretchU is a combination of physical therapy and acupressure massage.   It's effective in reducing injuries in sports and those who live active lifestyles.  I signed up for a monthly membership and go at least twice a month.<//Review><time>1566026262260<//time>< GmapID>

The more I workout and lose weight, the more I need to stretch. The key, I think, is stretching correctly. Stretch U is just the thing.  Like a massage, a lot of it is passive, meaning the technician stretches you.  I've been stretched 3 times now after a workout and I'm already feeling the difference in my muscles.  Give it a try after your next workout!!</review>

<review>Kobi is an EXCELLENT Stretch Therapist (my description). He is extremely knowledgeable about stretching and is constantly adding to his repertoire of techniques.  He is very attentive to a client's needs.

The only challenge is the restriction GROUPON is now enforcing where you can't utilize more than one of Strech U's Groupons in one year. Truly an unfair and cheap instance that reveals how stingy GROUPON can be, especially after making more than $194 million in 2016.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

An unexpected surprise, my right hand which has been numb over a year, has a 90%  return of feeling . Leg cramps have greatly reduced . The sessions are non invasive ,take about 20 minutes, are very  reasonable in price, a fantastic tune up for the body.<//review>< pictures>

I am often a deal hunter but went here on the fly. 5 people swormed my car each with their own task in mind and preformed their job super efficiently. Also 1 noted something for me to keep an eye on. Not an upsale just a friendly tip. Nice people, fast service, insanely convenient.. all around a positive experience<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><text>Quick and easy drive thru oil change. $28 flat which is a steal anywhere but especially in the Bay Area. Everyone was nice and professional. They didn’t try to upsell a bunch of add-ons to a basic oil change which happened at Oil Changers (a $30 something oil change quickly became $100). Will definitely be going back to this spot for future oil changes.</text></record></dataset><record>

Omg these people are amazing! A whole oil change in under 10 minutes and for $30 dollar flat for a mid size SUV fricking awesome!!! I highly recommend this service center. It's in a pretty sketchy hood but it's honestly the greatest deal EVER!!!!!< /text>

It’s not a typical drive in, get out of car, and wait model.  Instead you drive right through, stay in your car, and the whole process takes < 10 minutes.  Reasonably priced at roughly $35.  Staff also replaced wipers - at my request for another $15.  They also found that the drainage valve cap was stripped (likely from the last oil change) and offered to fix it for $5.  Not sure if I’ll be back in this area again soon, but if so, I’ll come back by.<//review>< resp>

<review>Overpriced. Way overpriced. Do not go here for any reason. insta Lube wanted 150$ for my oil change. Pro Lube on San Pablo charges 120$ for the same service, and 10min speed oil change on Telegraph charges 100$. So there you go.</review>< Pics>

I got a flat tire on my way to work and this shop is right down the street from my office. The owner was very friendly and accommodating! I brought my Mazda in with tire being questionable that it could be patched. These guys made it happen. Terrific service and attitude from all staff id certainly recommend it.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I had a great experience here! The customer service is excellent. I had to go back to work after dropping my truck off and I was provided with a ride back, and a pickup when my truck was ready. (My job is close by, so unsure of how far they drop off/pick up) I am not auto savvy…but Chris explained everything, kept in touch throughout the day with updates, and was very friendly. The mechanic (forgive me, I did not catch his name) was also very helpful and gave me instructions on how to do what I needed to. I have already set up another appt for my truck to be serviced here, and I highly recommend this shop.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1623540804427, 'text': 'Appreciate you commenting on our customer service as we work hard on that.

<name>Rodney Fite< /name><Review>The San Leandro location of George Oren Tire is a great example of why small business can thrive and compete against big box stores. If you're looking for the cheapest price you can go to a Costco or similar store or you will spend hours of your time waiting and being treated like cattle. For just a small amount more or actually sometimes even the same price you can have great customer service, knowledgeable staff, and not waste your time. I have used this location many times over the last several years. They always have in-depth knowledge of the tires as well as my vehicle. They have the knowledge to explain things well and for me at least most importantly their service is fantastic. They're on time, organized and don't waste your time. I can recommend them with absolute confidence.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly service. Getting a quote was quick and easy, as well as scheduling the service. I really appreciated how they advised of other services that were needed but were not pushy at all about it. Like other shops I've been to before. Price was comparable to the bigger names, and even cheaper than some. I will definitely go back again in the future and recommend them to others<//review>

GREAT! Service.  I pointed out a tire that was in really bad shape that I was not aware of.  I was able to get (4) tires that the manager went and picked up himself.  Service was just incredible.  I would recommend them to anyone and everyone.<//review>

I don’t think anyone enjoys having to take their car in for maintenance, but the folks at George Oren in San Leandro are great and made the whole process a breeze! Drop off was easy, I was given status updates, they even did some additional work for me that wasn’t scheduled and I got my car back the same day. I also didn’t leave feeling like I paid an arm and a leg, and I’m really pleased with the work they did. Everyone was friendly and professional, and I really appreciated the extra measures they’ve taken to keep everyone safe (masks, hand sanitizer, sanitized pens, etc). I highly recommend them!<//review>

<review>Super friendly staff and great service.  I was able to make an appointment easily by phone to get all 4 of my tires changed and balanced.  I opted to wait and the whole process took about 2 hours or so.  All the staff had masks on to ensure public and personal safety due to COVID and had hand sanitizer at the counter.  They had separate baskets for clean and used pens for signing paperwork.  Overall, great experience and would go back again.</review>< pictures>

Overall generally good shop that I’ve gone to for years but with this tire I just that I asked them to think about my vintage tire wheel and not pull of the weight if they could. Turns out the amount of the weight was just fine. But I get there and the pulled it off and also chipped the wheel paint  in various areas then just put the same weight back on 12 inches around the wheel. Couldn’t you just of rotated the tire on the wheel a bit as I asked? And left it where it was? They didn’t even attempt  it. At least you could have given it one attempt.< /Text>

<username>Stephanie Hanton</username><Text>Wandering around Oakland, too scared to cross the bridge on an almost flat spare tire, I found this place, which has impressive reviews. I pulled in, two hours before closing on a Friday before Christmas. I was immediately greeted on the lot by a friendly and efficient specialist, who listened to my issue. He found a bay for me within minutes. Next I made my way to the office and met the kindest, sweetest, friendliest receptionist ever. She, too, is efficient, and took my information. The owner was sitting at his unassuming corner desk, busy on the phone with orders. Lots of friendly customers breezed in and out. Next thing I knew, my car was ready. Total bill for a repaired tire, relief, finding a hidden gem? $30. I will be buying my next set of tires here. I wish everyone was so professional. I wish everything was so easy.< /Text>< response>

Great experience! Went in for a leaking tire that Subaru told me was just because of temperature changes, no holes they said. George Oren's team quickly found a nail and patched it up. In and out so quickly it was amazing. Really nice folks, thorough work and very affordable. I have found my new tire place! Thank you!< /Text>

Andy and his team do great work. I have used them for 2 decades. I have switched a time or two looking for better deals and service, but, it's not the same.
From the mundane tire purchase, to the safety inspection on recently purchased used car or drag slicks mounted on rims, they can handle it! Don't let the small shop or location fool ya. You won't be dissatisfied.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Spoke to Randy on Wednesday to see if I could have them replace rear shocks on my tahoe, he mentioned he couldnt promise anything but if I dropped my truck off friday he could possibly get it done. If not then it would be done on Monday. Thankfully he got it done on Friday considering one of the shocks was in real bad shape. Randy is hands down a key asset there. I will definitely will be bringing my cars there. Very professional and polite. Thanks again Randy!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The mechanics were friendly, easy to communicate and work with.  They answered my questions with patience and kindness.  The price was very reasonable.  They patched one tire and rotated 4 tires for $50. (It probably would have costed more at Tesla.)<//Review>

They know their business, have competitive prices, and are professional in going about their business. I recently bought new tires, and two weeks later, ran into a pot hole that destroyed one of the tires. The manager replaced the tire at his cost. No questions asked. It doesn't get any better than this!
I recommend George Oren to anyone looking for new tires, or for a place to repair tires.<//review>< username>

<rate>5</rate><text>I brought in my 90 Jeep Cherokee for full suspension repairs. Replaced all bushings with plastic derlin, shocks, and front steering shock. I mean this Jeep was mostly original. Maybe shocks were replaced once before. Broken motor mount, headlights needed replacement. You get the idea. But it has a replacement motor so putting $$ into this makes sense, plus it’s a off-road collectible now. Randy worked on it for a week or so while needed parts floated in. He worked a miracle on the suspension.  Added new Goodyear M&S tires too.  Drives like a dream. I took it up to 75 and no dreaded Jeep death wobble. I’m very pleased with the results and fair pricing! Plus, Randy kept me updated on progress and recommended work. Yes I recommend this shop.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>George Oreb Tire has been in business for decades. I really like their staff.  They took the time to enable me to pick the best tires for my Lexus.  The price was very reasonable and they did a great job installing all four tires.  The tires had locking nuts and the special socket to remove them was lost.  They got them off.  They also do wheel alignment.
Lastly, I like to support Local Business.<//Review>< UserId.>

The owner emailed us on a weekend after our initial inquiry to get us all set for new tires and made sure I was all taken care of before he had to leave town on Monday. He called when the tires I ordered came in early and I was in and out of his shop in 30 minutes. Got a great price on well-rated tires. We are never buying tires from anyone else.< /Review>< Pics>

I was coming to the studio one morning from the city and my left front tire started to go.

George Oren Tire was able to fit me in within the second wave of business and I had to wait less time than I would at another tire service (Except for Boris - but that is another story) and the same amount of time I would wait at at oil change service.  Pretty performing.

Plus, the manager was able to evaluate and recommend quickly and cost effectively.  My service began shortly thereafter following a pleasant conversation with another customer who bragged she'd been bringing all her vehicles there forever.

But before I let the sparkle get the dazzle in my eyes, I waited to see how things went.  My tire needed plugging and they found another that needed plugging that I didn't even know about while performing inspection.

The manager told me that because he had already quoted me one price for the first plug, he wasn't going to charge me for the second one.  He said he was not a pump and dumper, and I laughed with him.

Things went great and he did a free rotation included.  It has been running well since, but my experience working in service stations taught me not to rely on plugged tires so much as new ones, and Oren management advised rightly so while simultaneously estimating two good new tires for the maintenance of my vehicle.

About three weeks later when I was looking for the money to grab two new tires where the plugged ones were running, I got a 20% discount coupon on service which would have brought me to less than 100 dollars each for the new tires installed.

Unfortunately, I couldn't catch that wave, but I bet he will honor the offer if I brings in the June expiring coupon sometime this July.

Even if he doesn't I recommend their service to everyone and rate highest my own experience with George Oren Tire Specialist.

The LC

UPDATE: 7/14/2018:

Glad to hear my coupon is still valid and I look forward to conducting business soon.

Always helpful, reliable, know what they’re doing and never up-selling! Been using them nearly 20 years and can’t be beat. Used San Leandro site for RV and they were great, too.< /text>

<Review>I have always had a great experience. The waiting room is comfortable, everyone is friendly and they get you in and out in a timely manner. I have had good luck with their tires and can take them in for rotation and air check at any time. It is good to make an appointment for anything more than air though so you can get right in and out. I have found that my tires need extra TLC with all the potholes and they are there to give it. My car always feels good when we leave.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I ordered a coffee and a breakfast sandwich and had some stars to use for a free item  but wasn't able to use the stars for the sandwich which I haven't run into before. The employee at window was not the friendliest. Chalk it up to how busy it was. Not sure I will go back because of the odd drive thru set up and difficulty getting in and out of.<//text>< pics>

<review>When I drove up thru the drive thru to order there were many many cobwebs around the screen.  It was very unappealing(it made me feel dirty) It would only take one employee every few days to wipe/clean the screen and speaker to make your customers a little more happy.    I ordered a ice tea and when I got to the window I was served a ice coffee.  The employee was very apologetic but it delayed me a few mins.<//review>< pics>

This location is difficult to get in and out of. It shares it's one-way in & out and parking lot with a fast food restaurant.
Street traffic coming in can get so backed up that you can't get out if you parked your car.<//Review>

I chose to add 10 to wife's app while visiting from San Diego. I needed help with the app as I have never done this before. Girl didn't seem to want to be there nor help.
Next time I will stop at another location when u come up to visit every couple of months.</Text>

<Review>No one bothers to look at you or even greet you! Even though, I said "good morning!" I still got nothing! Not even an acknowledgement when I was ordering! I understand the mornings are the busiest and it can get hectic. However, at the end of the day, this is a "fast-food" business and the acknowledgement needs to happen!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is a good location and the staff seem quite nice and friendly.  The down side is that they can be difficult to access because of the layout of their drive thru and the drive thru for the restaurant next door.   This makes entering and exiting the parking lot a challenge at times.  Further, being so close to the lake, the amount of mosquitoes and gnats are at biblical proportions.  If you plan to visit here during the summer months, expect to be bitten by a flying critter.< /Text>< pictures>

The drive thru line goes by quickly, the down side to that is the staff is not very friendly. I definitely missed that part. I'm used to Starbucks staff having their friendly mini conversations. Or even eye contact with the people you are handing your food or drinks too</text>

I love Starbucks. From Pikes peak to Florida.  Just bought 5 $20 gift cards. Also purchased two java chip frappuccino drinks.  This was the worst preparation of the drink we ever got. In case you're interested the check was  #731867.< /text>

<rate>2</rate><text>This Starbucks sucks because it only had (1) electrical outlet available in the entire sitting area, and a guy was hogging it up. So much for being able to enjoy a good coffee and take care of business at the same time. Most Starbucks I have been too have numerous electrical outlets available.< /text>< userid>

<Review>This Starbucks is always busy, but don't let it fool you, yet your still in and out in no time. The staff is always on they're "A" game. And even while rushing around they find the time to be super friendly and helpful. The bathroom is constantly sparkling clean. I love this Starbucks cause it's right across the street from my work. Keep up the great work!</Review>< Pictures>

I been ordering the same drink for almost a year and no problems at other locations, and normally doesn't take that long.

People here are always nice. Super clean place. Can sometimes get packed usually for lunch and after 4 30, pretty quick to serve your drinks. Has outdoor seating, drive through, no lockpad for bathrooms. Decent amount of seating available</Review>

Location has always been clean and has also been remodeled recently to provide a nicer space to work and collaborate. This location is near businesses and the freeway so customers tend to come in waves with a lot of people whom are always in a hurry. There is a drive through. Sometimes the drive through line is long so I park and go inside to order...however honestly the staff is pretty efficient so the times I've waited in the drive through lines have been fast anyway. Staff is very friendly, very efficient, and make tasty beverages quickly.

This location tends to cater to busy people on the go, so the environment is a bit less relaxed than other Starbucks locations because of consumer needs and demands. I find that all this considered, the management and staff at this location does an amazing job fulfilling orders efficiently.</Text>

Coffee was on par with typical Starbucks.</Text>< rating>

It was my first time getting a refill, and they were super nice about explaining the policy regarding refills. I don't normally write reviews, but they were so cool about it I was stunned. Thanks guys!</Review>

<Text>This was a nice Starbucks located right off the freeway. It was clean the staff was friendly and there is outside and inside seating available. I'm pretty sure they had a drive-thru but I am not a hundred percent certain. It's located right off a busy street so it does not have the best view when you're sitting outside on the patio.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd6cc1e74ed5d:0x508bae881d41fa70</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We chose it because we figured coffee shops are good for studying and my friend had come to this specific Starbucks before to study. But she says they must have remodeled since then because this was not conducive to any kind of work. Two electrical outlets in the whole place, so when my computer got low we had to relocate to be able to plug in. And the plugs weren’t near any of the computer friendly tables. Super super super loud. So much noise. But it was clean.< /Review>< userid>

<Review>Ok, new review. With the changing of the seats and adding tables is a definite improvement. Much more friendly environment. I would give 5 stars if they added a little more power connectivity.

(Original post was 1 star.) [Is it just me or is Starbucks becoming more antisocial and more corporate "Thank you for your money goodbye" mentality. The remodeling job in the lobby is horrid, unfriendly and elementary. To me it looks like a cafeteria reject from a sitcom.]< /Review>< pictures>

<text>2 girls at this location are definitely racist. for the past 6+ months ive been having them both over charge me for coconut milk when i was told by many in higher management that they do not charge unless its over 4oz. these girls took it to a personal level to over charge me and be rude. I finally decided  to complain the day they called the cops on my husband for him enjoying his drink and the free wifi thats provided for all customers  with our 5 yr old daughter and 7 month old son. they are wrong rude and disrespectful, they know us know we are daily customers and that he comes by daily whats wrong with  that? its not like we dont order or buy anything. Not once did they offer to pay me back all the times she over charged me for the past 6+ months</text>< gmap_id>

Slow service. 3 employees talking to each other, moving at a snail's pace and they never fill up your drink all the way. There's  a SBux at every corner, I guess  this one doesn't want my business</review>

<review>Not the biggest fan of Starbucks because of the prices. I will go there every so often for a hot   Carmel Michiatto. The last 2 times I've gone to this location,  depending on who's making it of course, the coffee tasted horrible. So I spent about $4 on a coffee that I just poured down the drain twice. For somebody who doesn't go to Starbucks much at all, I was really surprised that the last 2 times I went the coffee tasted horrible. I have a grow coffee right next to me. And both times I told myself I would never go back to Starbucks and I did because of the convenience. But both times I have regretted it and told myself I should have just stuck with what I have known to be gred. And this particular Starbucks location is not for me. Now just because I don't go to Starbucks and doesn't mean I'm not a coffee drinker. I love coffee every day every morning afternoon and even in the evening I drink chai. So I do know what coffee is supposed to taste like. And Starbucks is just not doing it. Go to another Starbucks or go to grow coffee or there's another one that just opened up the street on Rosse & Tustin. Where the Burger King use to be.  I personally have not been to this coffee house but I have heard it's really gun. Everything is worth a try at least once. When I try it out I'll do a revealment y'all know how it taste.☕☕☕<//review>< rating>

It seems like it's faster to get down and order than go through the drive thru here but good luck finding a parking space when it gets busy.</text>

Smooth drive through. Not busy at 9am on a weekday, which was nice. Employee was smiling and friendly.

The layout of the drive-through is not great. If it had been busy, navigating that parking lot would have been rough.<//review>

<username>Michelle Van Dever</username><Time>1501728928640</Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I go almost every week day. I always have at least 2 orders that are seperate and with the 4 or 5 drinks total 1 is normal. The rest have something added or not added. I pick up coffee for my 2 bosses and one or two sometimes 5 coworkers. The people working behind the counter here kick ass! From the first time i don't think they've gotten anything wrong except 1 time! I say "behind the counter" because i tried going through the drive thru recently. I only tried that 4 or 5 times. My order was correct once. Not sure if they can't hear well or i doubt speak loud enough or clear enough. They never ask for me to repeat anything or say what? They offered to fix my order 3 out 4 times. The one time they didn't i let the girl know my order was wrong as nicely as possible. We all make mistakes and as i mentioned i have multiple orders that are altered. When i said excuse me these are the wrong size or this isn't right she said she was sorry ave then swore she heard me order what she made and then just stood there looking at me. Never offered to fix it at all.
Bottom line, for a positive happy experience, i suggest going  inside to order! They make me mad that i don't live close enough for that to be my regular Starbucks location!!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The drive through is open until 11pm as moted on their post,  but the coffee shop itself closes at 9 to night.  Dissapointed after driving all the way over to work and buying a $3.75 cup of coffee.< /Text>

This starbucks is going downhill. The newer staff is just plain rude and honestly, for the majority, dumb. Rushes you and make so many mistakes even. The past 4 times i have had something wrong. Funny thing is how they rush you but also take their sweet time. I honestly have to dedicate 30 minutes of mybtime just to wait for service and a drink. I prefer to drive a little further to another as there seems to be one every so many blocks.<//Text>

The order taker was not presented well and misspelled my name.  The Barista didn't seem to be happy and didn't call out my name, Everybody was reaching for drinks too see who's they were. Both seemed too be distracted by some type of personal emotion. Just my immediate opinion for this visit.< /review>

<text>My regular Starbucks before work, the baristas here are all very friendly and work well under stress (this store gets pretty insane with the drive thru and such). One of the few Starbucks where when you order a drink it is made with the correct amount of everything (for some accreditation, I used to work for Starbucks myself as a barista).</text>< rating>

Omg this is the slowest location I've ever been to and they mess up orders frequently. It's right near my house so I pray it'll be different but I know I've just wasted way too much money here. Back to coffee bean I go!<//Review>
