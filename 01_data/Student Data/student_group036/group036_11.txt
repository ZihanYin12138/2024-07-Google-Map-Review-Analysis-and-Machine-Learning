<rating>5<//rating><review>The best BBQ in LA that I've had. I was born and raised in New Mexico where Texas BBQ reigns supreme. I can tell you this spot in Pedro rivals them all. Mouth watering brisket a sweet and tangy sauce, you come away smelling smokey and I wouldn't have it any other way. Just as a roadside texas spot, these guys have just enough of what you could ask for and delicious sides. Go for the spicy potato salad it is awesome. I will definitely be back! Ask for extra sauce!</review>< pictures>

Amazing meals to celebrate life and special occasions. We highly recommend them because the brisket melts in your mouth, and the spareribs are so tender you don't even need all your teeth to enjoy them.  we know because we are old.< /text>< Pictures>

Every once in awhile we get to discover & enjoy a memorable food experience.
I had one at Whiskey Flats yesterday. Excellent baby back ribs, but the real stars were the brisket and the collard greens. The brisket was as good, maybe better, than I've had, in the past, in the San Antonio and Texas Hill Country. Smoked over almond wood, to perfection. The collard greens are their unique recipe. Never had collards to match them, ever. There's nothing complicated about this food, but the sheer excellent quality is worth a drive.</text>

A cute little atmosphere and the food was pretty tasty. Cornbread was not dry and the beans and slaw were also good. Ribs I wish were meatier so I would just try something different next time. It’s nice that they do small business events on certain weekends. I do have to comment on the nutty lady that lives on the corner lol she was cursing and screaming about people not being from Pedro and parking near her drive way. She was sporting a giant bottle of Bombay liquor haha so it could be that. Apparently she tries to cause a ruckus often regardless of the parking. Either way if you haven’t tried this place out I’d recommend it. And try to come during a small business weekend then you could also pick up dessert with your meal.< /Text>

I was so pleased with their food. Their ribs are so good. I’ve had plenty of different kinds of ribs but those were by far one of the best ribs I’ve had. The seasonings were spot on. They also had brisket to die for it was so juicy and mouth watering. I’m a meat eater and this place satisfied my cravings for some good meat.<//text>

Best barbecue I have ever had. Their bbq sauce is a perfect balance of sweet, savory acid and heat. The smoked meat is so tender! We took some to a family get together and realized we only had plastic utensils and was worried for a minute but you didn’t even need a knife.

We got a mix of the brisket, ribs and chicken. I am not normally a fan of ribs. These pork ribs are my exception. Meat just fell of the bone. Loved the rub they use on the brisket! The chicken had a nice smoked char to it.

We had the baked beans and coleslaw as a side. The beans had a nice smokey hint to them and again perfectly balanced the sweetness and savoriness. The coleslaw was perfect to cut through the meal. Not too sweet, and just a little creamy and that hit of acid, just the way I like it.

10/10 definitely recommend!< /Text>

Great BBQ however I wish I had brought my favorite BBQ sauce, for some reason the sauce they provide is vinegary any thin. But the meat is prepared well, tender and right.</review>

<text>I'm giving this spot a solid 5. I accidentally came across this spot, while riding my bike. The owner was super friendly and chatted with me, so I returned for lunch and the BBQ chicken-hands down, the best. Also, the side are great. Staff super friendly and food freshly cooked. I have zero complaints. The venue is only open on the weekends. Also, once their out of meat, they stop taking orders. In addition, cash only, vemo and Zell for payment.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Whiskey Flats was a new experience for me and my daughter. We live near by and didn’t know it existed!  What a great find. We arrived late and the only choice of meat where the ribs. OMG sooo good!  The pasta salad is awesome. I don’t think you can go wrong. The owner and staff are real down to earth San Pedro people. The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. Outdoor dining is nicely decorated. Covid guidelines observed. We’re so happy to have such a great bbq restaurant in our area. I hope yo’all come out and support Whiskey Flats!!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dd37fd8d124d57:0x92a52862af4bc60c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Just had the mix plate of pulled pork and smoked brisket. It was the most legit and amazing BBQ I've had in a very long time. So much so that I forgot to take a picture before devouring it... Lol! The only other decent BBQ place in SoCal is Phil's BBQ in SD but this actually far outweighs Phil's. They may only have a few menu options but you don't need many options when the food is this good. The food definitely speaks for itself. They were also very friendly and didn't take very long to come out. We may have gotten lucky tho bc there wasn't a line.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Well, my Tire Pressure light came on while driving on the 405. I stopped here since it was the closest place. The assistant at the time, Trevor, was really friendly and helpful. He checked all 4 tires, added some air, and even replaced a couple of the valve caps that were missing at no cost. If I lived nearby, I would definitely go back to this place due to its great customer service.</Text>< pics>

These guys are great. Honest, friendly and helpful. They always try to find any discounts they can give and are never pushy with their recommendations. Never had any issues with their work either. Kim is the best<//Review>

Double check that what they are quoting you actually needs fixing. 'My car would over heat and I was told that my radiator was cracked which I couldn't afford so I kept driving on it. Took it to another shop to get the oil changed and I was told it was overheating because I had no coolant and there was absolutely no crack in sight and there was air in the container it's been a few months and hasn't over heated yet. Good service and people but they will never get my money. I spent $900 getting my car fixed a few months ago and I wonder if even needed half that stuff now.< /Text>< Pics>

Second nail in a tire in less than two months, previous place wouldn't fix it and sold me a new tire. This place repaired it for free! Guess where I'm going to get oil change or new tires next time!? Also, it's right next to the big Westfield mall, so you got something to do while you wait.
Next time I'm going shopping there I might as well have them look at my truck!<//Review>

I can say only but thanks..

I had my break fixed somewhere else, and forgot to ask for a oil change , well decided to go to this business and asked for the oil change,

then the technician came to me telling me that the breaks work was not not properly done  and that the breaks could have been failed if I entered into the freeway..

That was a surprise, this people at this place saved my life.. and of my family...

You got a loyal costumer with me and my family and also friends cuz I will recommend this place to them surely..< /text>

This place is awful
They said it will take 2 hours to repair my tier and when I came after 2 hours and half they told me it is not ready yet, guess what!! They didn't start even..and when I asked the guy why? He said I told about 2 hours and he was so rude and the surprise that his manager was rude too. Lol
The problem is when they got the car on the track and started to fix it guess what!!! It's not repairable lol..it's not that only they don't have the tire lol
This place is a big meSS
I WISH MY COMMENT REACH ONE OF THESE MANAGERS UP THERE
thank you< /Text>

<date>1370453025180< /date><rating>2<//rating><text>After an oil change, they gave me a laundry list of repairs "I needed". New brakes, rotors, waterpump, shocks, etc. The noise I complained about (which they couldn't hear) when I accelerated was attributed to the water pump. (huh?) I went home to research online and found out they are NOT to be trusted.

Months later I went to a near by Goodyear. I got the oil changed, I told them about the noise. I asked them for a brake inspection and an inspection of the water pump and shocks. An hour later, brakes have plenty of life, one shock has tiny leak and can wait, water pump is perfect and the noise they narrowed down to a transmission problem. They referred me to a Dodge dealership since I was still under warranty.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0aa965a834f:0x4957c0fd667e30a7</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Came to install new tires, was told to come back in 1.5 hrs. When I returned, the car was still at the parking lot. Waited for another hour but the work hadn't started. Was asked to wait 2 more hrs - after that took my keys and went to another shop. Complete disrespect of my time.< /Review>

<Text>NO WIFI!? How do you have a waiting room these days that does NOT have wifi for customers?!

Also, the woman at the counter was curt and not very friendly.

I won't be coming back to this location - there are plenty of other locations nearby.< /Text>< Name>

On Wednesday they open at 9 because of short staff I heard. Plan to be there at least 2 hours.its very slow. Some lady went in with an appointment and still was a long while while they took her number. So even appointments have to wait quiet a bit<//Review>

The Oroville DMV has definitely improved in the last 3-4 years. The staff are working on better customer service. Also,  the ability to make appointments has helped to streamline things.  The lady,  Christina, who rode along with my daughter for help driving test was very friendly and professional.  My daughter reports that Christina gave her great feed back.<//Text>

Today, early December 2020, I went to the Oroville DMV office to register and license a used, homemade utility trailer that I bought  in California.  First, I went to the outside intake desk. Then I followed up with the inside window intake staff, then parked my vehicle and trailer at the  parking area for the clerk to "tag" my trailer with an ID sticker.  Next  I went inside to fill out and sign paperwork, pay my registration fees and tax.  I then received my registration paperwork and my new PTI license plate.  The whole process was so smooth and pleasant, and the staff were pleasant and friendly.  No crowds, and no waiting.  I prayed to God prior to going to DMV for a smooth transaction without glitches!  What an answer to prayer.!!!<//Text>

<Review>If you go on DMV website to see what documents/forms you need—you can print them out or go pick them up at the location to take home and fill out. Come another day with the prepared documents and it will be faster. Prepared = fast DMV visit. My visits have always been fast when doing this. Of course it’s going to take 4 hours if you don’t have anything ready. Sadly, everyone thinks it’s the workers fault for their own incompetence.</Review><name>Kendall White< /name><rating>5<//rating></record>

< review>
So I took my brother in-law to the dmv just about a week ago so that he could reinstate his drivers license that he had suspended 30 years ago due to the fact that he failed to pay child support. We get to dmv and I tell him Im going to wait in the car (its not like i can go in anyways). I figure even though he has an appointment he will be in there for atleast 45 minutes to an hour I mean he hasnt had a license in 30 years so I'm thinking he'll have to at least take a written test and an eye exam right. So Im sitting in my car reading the lastest news when here comes my brother in-law its only been 15 minutes what the heck. My in-law and yes I love him to death but there is no way he took a test, eye exam, and had his Pic taken in that short amount of time it would have taken him that long just to get through the first few questions not the whole appointment but sure enough here he was all big smiles and his head held high. He gets in and he says i got my license I said really how was the test he said what test the written exam nope i didnt have to take one he says ok eye exam he says i failed it i said he what do u mean he said i tried to read them off but i couldn't see the letters and then I the lady said ok lets take your picture and that was it i got my license. Wow really hasnt had a license in 30 years can barely read or see and hes handed a license what the f is this world coming to.<//review>

Only 2 Stars because the lady that works at Window 3 was helpful and nice (I only got her on my last visit 3 days ago) the reason for lack of stars is the man who works at window 2 is very rude, isnt helpful, and says very derogatory things to customers he's "helping" he will not give you documentation on how to file a Statement of Fact rather he will just say "The screen says this, so I dont care what you say you did, your wrong the computer is right".< /review>

<response>None</response><GmapID>0x809cb44b5986d521:0x7068efa48e26029c</GmapID><Review>Extremely rude and not helpful. I was the first customer in line when they opened, the employees did not fill me in on any instructions, they "screened" me for covid and helped other people along without any explanation. When I was finally seen the women "helping" me did not explain any requirements of registering an out of state vehicle but simply charged me, handed me a temp registration with a weeks time to return it with a certificate of weight and the vehicle for verification. It takes a lot of planning for me to be able to make it to the DMV, a week does not seem like a likely possibility to get the tasks done and drive my vehicle around which needs repairs. I discussed this but she didn't seem to care. Not to mention when I asked to pay on other vehicles I  my name she could not find any in my name.
It would be nice for the amount of money we pay towards DMV fees and the time it takes to arrange these things if they showed customers some kind of courtesy and respect.
I guess you dont have to when you are a required government employee.
I can honestly say I have never had such a poor experience at the DMV<//Review>< user>

< Review>
Its absolutely offensive how most of the Employees at the Oroville DMV office act towards customers . Granted not all seem to be so bad but there are definitely more employed here than need to be considering how few seem to be attending to customers during every visit Ive ever had to make to Oroville DMV office. And Ive been there a whole bunch of times during my 49 years in Oroville. If coffee cups ever learn to be rude to the public and ignore those who have had to take time off from work so they can walk around the office on their own Oroville DMV could get rid of 90% of its employed humans. The worst place ever to deal with because of it too<//Review>

DMV workers disappear into the back rooms a lot, leaving 1 or two workers serving the room full of waiting people, Some people are having to stand due to no setting room,  All that money spent upgrading this office didn't add more setting room. but did give the behind the counter workers more open space and comfort.

The staff is usually very helpful, maybe not in the best mood but that is understandable when you deal with grumpy customers. Yesterday, they had a new teller, and though the system they have in place makes it difficult for numbers to be processed and gotten through, he was very patient and still maintained a friendly demeanor. I think the biggest challenges that this DMV has is the lobby is small and on a busy day, seating can be limited and the system they use to process everyone is also slow. They definitely could use a few more windows open.< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Its a DMV people. A business. They deal with irate people because some don't understand how their actions prevent them from getting an id or license or they have improper paperwork and want to fight with them over semantics. They deal with getting yelled at and overall rude and disrespectful people all day long. I thinknthis DMV for as small as it is is pretty quick. I find that whrn i make an appointment with them things run a little smoother and quicker. If you dont like the wait...make an appointment.<//text>< UserId.>

Google says average wait time is 20 minutes to 1.5 hours. I wish. I’ve bwen here for over 2.5 hours and still have not been seen. And they have this archaic numbering system so you have no idea of you are being close to being called. A 2.5+ hour wait for anything is unacceptable.</text>< pictures>

When I said you spelt my name wrong he told me ,” well you’ll have to wait now and come back when you get your ID.” I was currently in school and needed my ID for my certificate and couldn’t be certified because they went of state ID spelling of your name. Also couldn’t get a social because of the misspelling even with my BC .. ridiculous</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Extremely unhelpful every time, today was the worst. I needed one thing done and the employee I "spoke to" wouldn't even let me finish my sentence before telling me I had the wrong documents. Even though they were the same official documents accepted by the Social Security office to get a new social security card. I took a 30 minute drive to Chico and they were extremely pleasant, not only did they get the job done for me, they did it with a smile in under 20 minutes without an appointment. It's worth the drive to the Chico DMV I promise.<//Review>< Pics>

Well. They are just doing their job but they aren't courteous and seem like robots.  Its so unfriendly and they are blunt and to the point.  I was treated like a criminal because i wanted to do an address change as an evacuees but i didn't qualify because i had a dui and they wanted to charge me 28.00. What gripped me was i didn't get because i had a dui what that had to do with the fire.  Anyway, the attitude was pay or not . So i went to the fema location and within 5 mins a friendly rep. from dmv processed my address change and bam it was over.< /Text>

Worst place to be at EVER! My mom and I waited for 5 hours. Other customers that came after us got their number(s) called and my mom and I sat there for the longest time waiting for our number to be called but every person after us kept getting called. Hate Oroville DMV. Would reccomend other DMV out of Oroville. If I could give it a star, I would give it a NO star.< /review>

This is the absolutely worst DMV office in California. The wait is always above two hours. Even with an appointment you generally have to wait at least half an hour, and appointments are booked out for weeks.
The staff is rude, unhelpful, and typically screws up the paperwork, requiring that Sacramento mail it back for correction. Do yourself a favor: Drive to another DMV office.<//review>

Worst DMV I've ever been to.  I'm sure there are worse ones but they have a terrible system and slow (possibly lazy) staff.
They could have a ton of people waiting and the staff will have multiple people take long breaks at the same time.
Save yourself the trouble and go to the Paradise DMV.</Text>

Slow is a compliment for this DMV. After getting a number from the clerk I saw that they were on number 52 I had number 75. Knowing how sloooww they are I was able to go gas up the car, go to the post office and get some lunch. When I returned over an hour later they were still on number 52. This must be the worse dmv in the country.<//review>

The worst place ever. Online services are bad too. People are rude and services suck all around. Why do we pay to have this? I have attempted MULTIPLE times to get a car title transferred to my name only to be unsuccessful. Truly frustrating to say the least.  EVERYONE cringes at the thought of having to deal with the people at this office, or any office in general. UGH...my frustration could not be felt through these stupid words. I'M DONE!!!</Text>

Person I spoke with on phone (lady) 10/27 @ 12:45 was so rude I do not understand why the DMV can get away with acting like this,my mom works 4 state and they r told 2 treat people with respect! Do u not realize u work 4 us,we pay taxes so u can work. You guys have a bad rep. And it needs 2 change! I wish I had her name but in my experience its more than half of your workers so what difference does it make? JUST FIX IT! ENOUGH!!!! Becky</Text>

This place is horrible.  The employees are rude, the service is so slow, and the waiting area is so small (probably because if the backlog of people).  The State of California needs to pay a visit and fix this place.< /text>

This office is not only extremely slow and rude they are plagued with clerks that are extremely misinformed on DMV policy/procedures. Be warned. Be wary. Go elsewhere.< /Review>

<Text>I really think that this model agency is one of the best, but to answer some of your questions. If you haven’t heard back from them it means that they looked at you but don’t think u are good enough. Which isn’t nice but life is life and all that matters is that you are a good person.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>No one's at the front desk to help you. Some ladies that have experience auditioning here were helpful to direct me to the restrooms and L.A. models behind the talent agency in front. No one at the front desk here either, but eventually showed up and offered to help. Talked me thru what L.A. models wants from you and how to move forward. Tossed business card on the counter as if she didn't want to touch me... Even as a receptionist, you represent your employer... Good luck to everyone else.<//Text><username>Miss Shanti< /username></record></dataset><record>

I've heard great things about this company, I called to find out more information about becoming a model/casting calls and the lady wouldnt answer any of my questions and told me that I have to refer to the website. It would have been much easier if she would just answered a simple question.< /Text>

<text>I honestly loved the enviroment of this place its a cute little place but the people there were great and very helpful. They were closing soon and they waited fo us to bring our little bird Paco so they can attend to him. It was an emergency and there where other places that didnt feel like helping us out with our baby. This place welcomed us and helped us out right away. Our baby passed the next day but i know that if I would have taken him to this place first he would have had more of a fighting chance. Thank you guys for doing what you could to help us.</text>< Pics>

I called about my beloved chihuahua who has been battling an illness and we had to do the inevitable.  It was probably the most difficult decision we've made as a family.  From the moment I called  and gave them my name they knew who I was talking about and guided me through the process. They gave us privacy and allowed the family to be present to say our last goodbyes. I would definitely recommend this clinic. They understand your needs.<//text>

Dr. Singer has provided excellent care of our 2 kids for the past dozen years.  He has been all we would expect; professional, personable,  compassionate and very transparent.  One aspect that sets him apart from the many vets we've seen is he explains things in great detail, which is so much appreciated.  Our 2 kids have since "moved on", but we have many memories of the great care Dr. Singer provided to our 2 kids and to us personally.<//text>

I took my rooster for the vet, to check on him because of his wing maybe it’s a tumor not sure, but the vet didn’t know neither, so he suggested to cut the wing for close to $500,00 so I said that’s too much, they tried to give me some options to pay but I said no, then they offered some programs to put him down to which I said no thanks, so I told my wife to pick up the Rooster( by the way I don’t fight roosters, this one is a pet my family’s favorite).
Seems that because I didn’t do any of what they suggested, they call animal control and a sheriff came to my house that we’re not supposed to have roosters in Castro valley, which I know but I have the roosters in Ceres not in alameda County, I just brought him to Hayward to the vet because of my work , so why did they call the sheriffs? They told me that because they worried about the rooster health, really how is he gonna be? I have a dying rooster why don’t you answer that for me? What if I had pay the $500 that’s my question, so don’t trust this place they will get you some how if you don’t spend your money, to all of this I paid about $80 so they could call the sheriffs on me.</text>

Staff didn’t seem to be caring and the manager’s attitude is unprofessional.  Went to a second vet and got a different diagnosis that this clinic didn’t catch.< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>My husband took our chameleon in b/c he seemed dehydrated. He received treatment and within a few hours our pet was dead. I called to and was told that my chameleon must have been too sick or the treatment was too much for him to handle. Personally, this seems very unethical, if you knew my chameleon was too sick why would you suggest treatment. Not only that, my pet was still active just behaving out of the norm. So, his death was unexpected. The purpose of taking your pet into the vet is to receive proper treatment and an honest, professional opinion. Sadly, this was our first and only visit to this place. If I could give this place zero stars I would.</review>< Pics>

I took their new puppy vaccination package. Price wise, they were below the VCA hospital. The staff were all friendly. Ramon took care of our Bodhi (lab puppy). Dr Singer seemed quite informative and advised on the food too. The bandana pic of our puppy was so cute n adorable.<//review>

<Review>We were very satisfied patients of Dr. Mobile's for many years, so I recently brought in my 3 yr. old ESA cat for a urinary tract issues. Dr. Singer apparently did an examination without my presence, made a diagnosis (made excuses for not exactly knowing what the problem was,) and without any consultation with me or providing a cost estimate, he administered treatment consisting of LRS fluids subcutaneously (not intravenously. No blood work or urinalysis was performed, but Dasuquin was prescribed for "crystals" in the urinary tract. Dr. Singer was unable to give me any information on the medication and, frankly, told me "they don't really know how or why it works, but it does." I paid approximately $150 and didn't receive an invoice or explanation and breakdown of the charges. He also provided me with Ziploc bag containing a urine specimen jar with a small amount of aquarium gravel, a syringe, and detailed instructions for collecting a specimen which was to be returned to him in 10 days. (The gravel was only a sample, and I was to purchase a large bag of the non--absorbing "litter" to accomplish this. No cost estimates or advices were provided about SUBSEQUENT visitsThe next day, I called to tell them the cat was experiencing significant swelling on the left side of his face. I brought him back in, examined him without my presence again, and gave him an injection of, apparently, antibiotics, citing a temperature of 102.5. An additional $111 was paid, in full.
A week later, my cat is still in distress, presenting bloody urine droplets.  When I arrived, I was asked to pay an additional office exam fee of $54. On a limited income widows benefit, at the end of the month, I explained that I didn't have funds immediately available to cover it and requested to make other arrangements, i.e., waiving all or a portion of the follow-up exam fee, making payment after the 1st of the month, or smaller installments.
Again, the cat was examined in my absence, and returned to me in the waiting room. They told me that because of my "financial hardship," it would be best to take him to the SPCA "because they handle stuff like that." Dr. Singer was sitting at the reception desk when I clarified my request for an accomodation on the billing, not free or low cost services. They explained that without payment of $54 up front, the Dr. couldn't see us. I asked what my prior $250 covered, as this was a follow-up, and for clarification of the diagnosis; had there been a urinalysis, was there a bacterial infection, or an obstruction? I basically wanted to know what I had already paid for and what had been done so I could tell the other vet. With that, Dr. Singer stood up and told the techs to leave so he could handle my questions. He was immediately condescending of my financial position, and suggested that I was irresponsible for the health and welfare of an animal.  I asked him to consider alternative payment plans, and he refused to see us without payment of a $54 exam fee up front.  He then told me to leave and not come back. They provided a printout of the services as Dr. Singer berated me for forgetting that he had "explained" everything to me already. When I asked if we actually knew what the problem was, since the treatments obviously weren't working, and a urinalysis to confirm the appropriate antibiotic for bacterial infection, he refused to answer. He shoved the one-page "report" at me with no further explanation whatsoever. He was arrogant and antagonistic,  and I commented on his level of professionalism. He then made derogatory comments about my character and insulted me, telling me to "get out and don't come back!" I was like, Really? He then followed me out the door to my car, harassing me like I was stupid. I asked him to please back away, go back inside, and stop the rude behavior. He persisted even when I asked him why he was following me outside and wasting his precious billable time.  The bottom line...Dr. Singer failed to provide professional services, and harassed and bullied me when I questioned him.<//Review>< resp>

Dr Singer has been treating our cat for many years and he has saved his life last fall. His experience and knowledge was crucial in making this happen. Emergency doctors at a near by animal hospital were all about how many blood tests and ultra sounds and whatnot can they do and charge for. Without dr. Singer's careful guidance we wouldn't be able to pull Socks through the worst time in his life.<//Text>

BEWARE-Don't take your pets here.  We have been taking our pets here for many years and even when it was the real Dr. Noble, long before Dr. Singer took over his practice.

Most of the technicians and people in the front office have left that were so nice.  Now, the people who work there are rude, unprofessional, unorganized, and inconsiderate.

One of our pets is a 12 year old shitzu named Pepper who is our baby. Before Thanksgiving I called to pick up his medicine that he takes for pain and arthritis.  Apparently a new receptionist named Nancy answered my call and was having a bad day or it was just too complicated and stressful for her to answer the phone.  My issue is that they would not let me pick up Pepper's prescription for pain after I told them that Pepper did not have any medicine left and was in pain.  They have absolutely no compassion or heart, obviously they are in the wrong profession.

Dr. Singer, you are giving the 'real' Dr. Noble a bad name as he would have never done this.

Our pets are our babies and mean the world to us.  We will never go back here again.

If you care for your pets like we do...Don't go here, find yourself a good and compassionate vet.<//review>

I had an appointment today with Dr. Singer at 3:45. A specialist was scheduled to be in at 5 to do an ultrasound. The specialist arrived early and they decided to do the ultra sound early even though I had an appointment. Not a routine appointment but my dog is having problems that they haven't resolved as of today. They did however, put me and my dog in an exam room where we sat and sat and sat. I finally asked the receptionist if any one was coming in and she told me what happened and I should reschedule!!! I was there for a scheduled appointment, they should have seen us before they started on the procedure EARLY!! Very bad business.</review>

Please be cautious of this vet. They did a C/S on my shepard who had an unexpected pregnancy and she ended up passing away the emergency vet I took her to stated that the vet did a poor stitching job and they didn't even give her a coller for her to not lick the wound. I can never get my dog back our whold family is devastated.</review>

Our family has been going to Noble Veterinary Clinic since 1971.  In that time they have taken care of our many dogs from German Shepherds, Great Danes, German Shorthair Pointers, Labrador Retrievers, and a variety of mixed breed rescue dogs.

Our experiences have been excellent without exception -- not only the Vets themselves; but the staff is attentiive, professional and caring.  Noble Veterinary has our highest recommendation.</review>

<text>I went in two days ago because my dog had a strange rash in his leg. Although the technicians were very nice and helpful, Dr. Singer was absolutely the opposite. Prior to todays visit, my dog had never had never gone to the vet. He was afraid and confused. The fact that he was being touched by people he didn't know and did not take the time to pet him and make him feel comfortable did NOT make things better.

After he was done being examined, Dr. Singer came back and the first thing that came form his mouth was, "your dog is a problem dog". I would've much appreciated something in the lines of, "your dog is okay but we need to work on his behavior come next visit". He never gave me the chance to tell him that my dog is very socialized and behaves very well with people.

I have to point out that my dog never once barked or tried to bite during the entire visit. My poor dog was never made at ease and it showed in his nervousness.

Dr. Singer made me feel like i didn't know what i was doing. He told me that next time i brought him not only did i had to give my dog a tranquilizer but i had to bring him in with a muzzle. the icing in the cake was that he wouldn't let me borrow one and that i had to purchase one myself.

Perhaps it was a bad day, i don't know. But what i do know is that i'm not setting foot inside that vet clinic ever again.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Spoke to the Dr. On the phone. Very hostile and argumentative for no reason. Wouldn't want that kind of person treating my dogs. The  other reviews about the Dr. aggressively handling pets seem spot on.</review>

This is a very nice Mobile Home Park and has some lovely homes some newer quality as well as some older homes. Unfortunately everything in the San Diego area is rather pricey the farther you go away from the city then you find prices at our lower but even in Chula Vista you're going to be paying upwards of $700 for a nice park and in San Diego you'll be paying closer to $1,000 a month to live in a nice park.<//review>

Horrible experience! Very RUDE receptionist! I just found out I was expecting and it was my first visit. Everything was fine checking in but the actual appointment and checking out was the worst. I was told by the nurse during my first ultrasound literally that she couldn’t find anything or hear a heartbeat because most likely your baby is DEAD. The person that did my ultrasound was not even a doctor, it was a nurse. AND when I checked out to schedule my next appointment that was recommended during my appointment, the receptionist told me “I don’t know what to tell you we are booked out with patients already scheduled! So I’m going to have to get back to you another time when when have an opening and slow down!” Then while I was asking a question, she answered a phone call in the middle of me talking and walked away. It’s now the next day and still haven’t heard anything about a future appt. SAVE YOUR TIME AND CHOOSE A DIFFERENT OB!:(<//Review>

However, I’ve had nothing but horrible experiences here at West coast OBGYN. I’m in the process of switching prenatal facilities. My first appointment, they “misplaced” my urine sample… how does that happen?! My second appointment was a total nightmare, I was advised to take medication for a disorder I don’t even have! They try fitting women of color in a mold to avoid doing their job & making things easier for them. Thank god I got a second opinion, I was told NOT to take the medication they recommended at WCOBGYN, on top of that, the front desk lady Mariana, was so rude! I gave her my new insurance & the moment she looked at my card said “no, we don’t accept that”….. which is not true, I have blue shield & only purchased that insurance to be able to go to West Coast - it was a huge ordeal, she raised her voice & was stressing me out to be quite honest. Keep in mind I’m 5 months pregnant. I had my health insurance broker call to explain that they cover my insurance and she just kept saying how she’s “supposed to be off work by now”  overall horrible experience.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbffe1dc2c1387:0x21c66d7b735349ee< /Gmap_id>< username>

Everytime you call you wait on hold for a crazy amount of time and the dr I saw in person was nice but I felt like my concerns were not really addressed and told that was standard of care (pap smear every 3 years) even though I've been receiving one every year to be safe after some concerns earlier in my history.

But I unfortunately did not.  Dr. Chirrico was the Dr I saw and was very rushed, pushy, and was not really welcoming to me as a 1st time pregnant patient who is also high risk. I had a really bad appt with her one time and I left a voice-mail to the manager of the practice and they never returned my phone call to listen to my concern. I even requested to see a new Dr at the practice. I did the next appt but apparently they don't put good notes in the system or on my file because the blonde receptionist made my last appt with the Dr I was upset with. I took it anyways becsuse I'm moving soon and soooo glad that this Dr or anyone from this facility is not delivering my 1st baby.

Anyways I went to the carlsbad office and there is a Blonde lady with a British accent (the receptionist ) who was very rude and unwelcoming as well. Every single appt I went , she would be nice to the guest in front of me or behind me but never me and I was always nice to her since day 1. And like the other reviews said their call staff who answers the phone are the worst and phone etiquette, you have to repeat yourself several times for what your calling for because they don't know how to listen and or help with what you want.

The only person I liked here was one if the nurses in the back, I think her name is Brenda or Maria. She is a young girl who knows what she is doing when it comes to drawing blood and needles. As I am for one a big baby to needles and she never once hurt me or stabbed me more than once than other nurses have before at other doctors offices.  She is very professional and knows exactly what she is doing in the medical field.

Hope this review helps anyone that is looking for an OBGYN.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffe1dc2c1387:0x21c66d7b735349ee<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have no idea what it is like to work with this office from the beginning of your pregnancy, but if you're looking to transfer into their care, GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE. This office is not interested in the health and safety of your baby, your wellbeing, or being helpful in any way, shape, or form. Do not ignore the other reviews! Please beware, you will not find concerned staff here. After a month of trying to get into their office, at over 32 weeks pregnant without having a glucose test done, I will be finding a different office to verify my son's wellbeing and see him into this world.< /Text>< pics>

<text>All the doctors and nurse practitioners are very knowledgeable and caring. They took care of my two pregnancy checkups and deliveries. I am extremely happy with them. No doubt, it is a busy office. I feel that they have done their best with the amount of patients they take care of. Parking space is limited but they are free parking. I am glad that they have moved from a paid parking office to their current location.<//text></record>

<Review>Was referred here and was seen by Dr. Underwood.  From getting scheduled to checking in and meeting the great staff! Dr. Underwood was quite great at answering all of my questions and getting my tests done. Her MA was absolutely one of the most pleasant, efficient and did my blood draw without any problems.</Review>< Rate>

<Review>I'd give this practice a 0 if it was possible. When I found out I was pregnant, I called to set up my 8 week ultrasound as a new patient and was excited to meet the doctors and staff. Unfortunately, a few weeks after, I began to spot bright red. When I called West Coast to talk to a nurse, I was told they couldn't see me since I wasn't an established patient and to go to the ER. I spent 6 hours in the ER and had to call in sick to work. I continued to spot, getting worse by the day. I called West Coast to see if I could get an earlier appointment and was again told no. A few days later I began what I suspected was a miscarriage. I called West Coast and was again told to go back to the ER. I explained that I couldn't miss anymore work and had to literally BEG the nurse to be seen by a doctor to see what was going on. They still didn't want to see me because I wasn't an established patient yet. Finally, they agreed to see me and confirmed I had a miscarriage. I was prescribed misoprostol to push the rest of the tissue out. The directions were to take 4 pills that evening and 4 more pills 24 hours later. That night I experienced extremely painful cramping from the pills and was up all throughout the night. At one point I thought I was going to vomit. When I called the next day to see if I could get some painkillers for the second round, I was again told to go to the ER if my cramps were that bad. Frustrated at the whole situation, I left a voicemail for the doctor and have not heard back. This practice does not care about their patients. No one should have to be scared, in pain and begging to receive medical care. From one healthcare practioner to another, you should be ashamed and embarrassed at the pathetic level of care you provide. I'd strongly advise not using this practice.</Review></record>

From the staff to the array of doctors- they are phenomenal! I primarily see Dr. Goodwin. She is absolutely wonderful. She makes you feel as though you can tell her anything and treats you as a person not a patient no matter what the situation. Her nurse Ms. Marilyn is fantastic! I probably called 3 times a week while I was pregnant. She always called back and happy to help me with anything I needed no matter how big or small. I just cannot say enough about this office. I also saw Dr. First quite a bit through my pregnancy. She was outstanding and sympathetic as well. The ladies at the front desk are always happy to help as well. I just cannot say enough about this group of health care professionals. I would highly recommend this office to anyone!

<review>Nurse practitioner couldn't correctly answer my questions. Doctor Shuckett left me waiting for over an hour and then when I am finally seen she seemed rushed and uninterested. I was called 3 weeks after lab results showed an infection which needed to be treated with no explanation for the delay. I was told wrong results by the doctor and when told I was informed differently by the NP she argued with me about the results which later after talking to the NP again I found out the doctor was wrong. Bedside manner was terrible. The way they deliver news was devastating and with no follow up education. My experience was very bad. Also when I decided to switch doctors it was nearly impossible to get them to send my medical records to my new office. Took over 2 weeks multiple phone calls and messages with no return calls. I finally had to drive to the office and pick them up myself. Very disappointed!! This is my first child I was hoping for a pleasant experience to go along with my excitement. That did not happen at this office.<//review>< Time>

For my overall experience I'd have to say a couple the women working there need some manners and proper bedside coaching. I went to this office for Dr. Saffer who is amazing! If I would have only been seen by him this place would be getting 5 stars but since they have pregnant women visiting with all their doctors since whomever is on call that day will be delivering your child that isn't the case. On a few occasions I was treated with disrespect and spoken to in an unprofessional manner by the doctors and midwife I saw. I can't remember the name of the woman doctor who was the rudest but she's tall, slender, and has black hair. I wish I could remember her name! She was rude every time I saw her. I literally prayed she wouldn't be the one delivering my baby. She was rude during 2 of the scheduled visits I saw her for, when I wasn't aware of something before being induced the nurse called her to explain things to me, she rudely told me my chart stated someone already went over it with me. I asked her if she could repeat it for me because I couldn't recall it. She did and then asked, "Now do you remember?" I replied that I didn't and she gave me a dirty look a chuckle and left. Then when she checked on me after I gave birth she said, "Wow, 5.5 hours? You're lucky she let you have that baby naturally" she was referring to the doctor that delivered my baby (who was amazing). Mind you, this was my first child and I hear it takes some way longer than that with their first. I can't recall the name of the midwife that saw me at my 6 week postpartum visit but she has a short haircut, one really sort like most men have. When I came in for my visit I told her my leg was still numb and that it was so numb it hurt. She said she wasn't going to give me pills. I told I didn't want pills, I still had the ones prescribed to me and that I was mentioning my concerns as I was asked to. She told me to give it a week and it should go away. Then she asked me what type of birth control I wanted. I asked if I had to take it for some reason and she said unless you want to be miserable with a newborn because you're pregnant. I told her I would be overjoyed if I was given another child no matter when and passed on the birth control. Needless to say I will not refer this office to anyone who asks me for a referral. Too bad because I really like Dr. Saffer. Maybe if the doctors were seeing patients all the way through to their delivery some sort of relationship would be built and the respect would form because apparently these two women don't know how to be professional. As a footnote the reason I don't recall names is because this was almost a year ago, I decided against writing it while I was still there but I think people should hear the way a couple bad apples can make an experience that should be memorable for the good not so pleasant.<//Text>

<Text>Not a fan. Always scheduling month or more out, and could care less what my reason is, even if it's an urgent matter. Waited almost 1 hour for my doc last time I was in there, because it was a "busy day" for her. Well guess what, i am busy as well.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I just literally on the phone with them not even 20  mins ago, they have the worst customer service that’s I ever talked to. As a new patient I’ve tried to call and scheduled an appointment because I got my referral that I got from tricare. The first person that I talked to said she’ll call me back so I said okay, I waited 6 hours and nothing happened so I ended up calling again a different person answers she said hold then hanged up the phone and I was shocked because the wait is exhausting before they answered. So I tried to be patient and called again after an hour the last person that I talked yesterday told me that the other two person that I talked was off the clock and she even told me my referral is only for annual, but it’s not, I’m not gonna kept calling if it’s not something serious that I wanna get addressed on. Also I was like where’s the call back that they promised?  if you told me you’re gonna call me back I expect a call before the end of the day and it’s their job.
So today I received a miscall from them and I called them back so I was placed on hold again because they never left a voicemail or anything to me. Then the lady said rudely “ do you need their phone #?” I was like what? And she said “well you need this # in order to make an appointment?”  Not to mentioned the # that they gave me is wrong, I’m here to see an OB not to get MRI or CT Scan. Their so confusing.

After this experience with them I don’t know how someone like that can talk rudely and dosent  even say her name or greet nicely. I hope she will changed her attitude of how she talk to people and god bless her.<//Text></record>

I'm truly sorry to hear that others had an unfortunate experience here. As a father of four my experience has shown that a good relationship with the OB GYN's office is crucial in easing the concerns that come with an already stressful chapter in a parents life whether it's the 1st or the 4th or even more! Overall our experience here was wonderful! Yes there are multiple Dr's but use that to your advantage! After a couple visits and you find one you like, request your appointments to be when they're on duty. If you feel that strongly you can even induce to the day that Dr's on call!  Maybe we're just easy going but we liked all the Dr's. Even the staff was great to deal with which while some people may not care, when dealing with the stress of pregnancy, every smiling face goes a long way! The Dr that ended up bringing our baby Haley into the world was Dr. Christine Sterling and she is hands down absolutely amazing! Her positive energy is absolutely infectious whether it be a check up, delivery, she probably even makes paying taxes seem exciting! She's like the super hero of Dr's! We truly felt like she was going to deliver our baby, then go out and fight zombie's! I've never seen anyone that energetic at a hospital at 5 o clock in the morning! We are so grateful to her for helping turning the fear to fun! Keep in mind that online reviews are never a fair assessment as you're not hearing from everyone. Mistakes happen all the time and I truly find it tragic that anyone's YEARS of hard work, dedication, and sacrifice to be in the medical field would so easily be dismissed over pettiness. Thanks for taking the time to read our take on it!<//Text>

I don't have a primary doctor when I go to West Coast, but every doctor and nurse that I have seen have been very friendly and helpful. I recently had my second child and went to West Coast Obgyn for all of my prenatal visits. Even though this was my second child, the staff always had a lot of insight to share whenever I had any questions. When I was close to my due date, they gave me a gift bags filled with bottles, formula (if I chose to supplement) and coupons for other baby and postpartum products.

Now that I've had my son, I plan to continue to go to West Coast for all of my regular check ups.< /Text>

<text>Warning: some mildly graphic medical details in the post.

I first found West Coast a little over three years ago when I first moved to San Diego.  I knew we were looking to add to our family soon and wanted an office that catered to OB and Gyn needs. I found them pleasant, easy to work with, not pushy with pill based contraceptives like some places I've visited (they give me rare stroke-like migraines so I cannot take them). You do pay for co-pays and such up front so be prepared.

Once pregnant a year later, I was assigned Dr. French whom I met a few times.  Patients do see multiple doctors during the pregnancy, so if you don't like this option, you should go elsewhere.  I was fine with this and appreciated getting to know different doctors.  I had a bit of bleeding early on and they were able to see me right away and confirm that everything was alright, though I had low Iron levels.  I opted for a c-section but was a good candidate for a VBAC having had an emergency one with my first child, but they thoroughly explained all my options and let me really make the decision.

Day of birth I was at Sharp Mary Birch, everyone was really nice and attentive and it went so smoothly in less than 45 minutes!  During recovery on the second day, I had some incision line bleeding and Dr. French recommended a blood transfusion and iron infusion.  Again, she explained the risk/benefit and let me make the choice since it wasn't a medical necessity.  After the procedure, I felt so much better and was glad I made the right choice!!!!

Follow up care at 6 weeks after birth was fast and they really were nice and made sure I was handling the new baby and myself well.  18 months later I am healed well and have a very flat low-line scar. If my insurance through work hadn't changed I would still be with them!

I highly recommend morning appointments and once you start going bi-weekly and weekly to schedule your appointments as far in advance as you can.  It'll make your life easier!  One downside is that their parking lot is kind of the pits, but there is parking across the street at the Sharp-Reese Steely building that is easier to navigate and find a spot.< /text>< Response>

<Review>I dont really believe this outfit should be open for business.  You only see nurses and they are unresponsive to their patients' needs, they lose records and they dont allow you to see the Doctor when one is needed..  They only have that stupid British accent in their answering voice mail.  They think it makes them more sophisticated.  My wife and I had to change Doctors eventually because of how incompetent they are.  I advise anyone not to have them as your Doctor.   One would be better without a Doctor than to use West Coast OBGYN.< /Review>< Pics>

< review>
This review is for the North County office - during my VERY complicated pregnancy, I saw Dr. Meshkat, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Saffer, and Dr. Chirico. From my second trimester on, I had to be monitored heavily due to my son having a 1:31 chance of Down Syndrome and Intrauterine Growth Restriction. The last two months of my pregnancy, I was monitored several times a week, and each time, the doctors had a plan and always assured me that my son would be okay, even if he had to be delivered early.

He ended up being delivered via C-section by Dr. Hoover, and she did an amazing job. My son was born at 34.5 weeks at just 3 pounds because he was no longer growing in the womb, and his survival is totally attributed to the careful and difficult decisions made by these amazing doctors.

My son had a 3 week stay in the NICU at Sharp Mary Birch and I received several visits from these doctors just to see how we were doing, which meant so much during such a difficult season.

I'm happy to report my son does not have any genetic issues and is a perfectly healthy 4 month old :)

Maria (the nurse) and Beverly (the receptionist) are also wonderful - because of my frequent appointments, they became friends and support for my husband and I!

If we choose to have another baby, it will certainly be under the care of this incredible group of people.<//review>

I don't go to many OB/GYN's due to the fact I'm a male but I'll still look at it from my point of view.

I have two children, one being born three days ago. They are from different marriages and had prenatal care from different OB/GYN's. One from Balboa Hospital and the other from West Coast.

I would have to say, the contrast could not be more apparent. Granted they have a 7 year difference but from what I hear, not much has changed. The doctors seem to care more, the facility is certainly nicer, and just overall portrays a more welcome feeling. I will say though, west coast is notorious for making you wait for your appointment though.

Overall though, I would choose West Coast again and I'm sure my wife would agree.

Update: I will add this, if you call them and they tell you they will call you back, they won't.  It is like pulling teeth to get them to do anything over the phone.<//review>

Medical assistants should not be allowed to man the “question line.” I’m surprised they don’t realize what a liability this is. They let their MA’s give medical advice to pregnant women, and there is little, if any, supervision of what is said. They don’t introduce themselves as MA’s, so you think you are speaking to a nurse. This is so misleading and unethical. To not have them properly trained to give their name and title ...this is one of the many problems with the practice. There are long wait times, long hold times, poor patient education, poor patient follow-up, no one to speak to when a problem does arise... I guess this is the catch of a rotating practice in that no one will claim you as their patient and you feel alone when you can’t get through to a provider to help you. It is apparent they are over-worked, under-staffed, and provide little training for their front end. One star is for the mental anguish, loss of time and money, and improper care of myself and my pregnancies. I have had some talented MD’s and NP’s that I’ve seen there over the course of my two pregnancies, but I am making this change now because of the pattern of errors they have made in my care and they way the office has neglected to fix it.<//Text>

<name>Ash Tsipporah Herbert</name><Text>This place & the people who work here genuinely don't care about their patients at all. The office is poorly managed, the patient bathrooms are very unsanitary, rooms are small & they charge for every tiny thing, even Hibiclens soap for C-section deliveries. But they will gladly give you a free onesie for your newborn baby to exploit them for publicity on social media, ugh. Such a disenfranchised & condescending demeanor from some of the doctors & NP's. I'm 37 weeks pregnant & had a late night appointment so my active duty Navy husband could drive/accompany me & they were more concerned about ushering me out the door at the end of the appointment than scheduling a follow up appointment or giving me proper paperwork that I need for my upcoming C-section. Good luck speaking with anyone on the phone either. Long hold times & poor patient follow up. Also they only do 1 in-house ultrasound & outsource their bloodwork to Quest diagnostic so enjoy driving all over tarnation to get these basic services done that should be included at their office. And good luck getting them to discuss the results with you. I had to request my results directly from Quest Diagnostics & analyze them myself to learn I was anemic!!!< /Text><Response>None</Response><pics>None</pics><date>1544197901849< /date>< Rating>

< Review>
I really wanted to like this office and the staff, but being in the healthcare profession myself, this office has terrible patient service and care.  My first appt in April with Dr. Goodwin went very well.  I came in for a check up and let her know that I wanted to make sure I am healthy and on the right track for getting pregnant as I got of birth control July of last year, we just started trying, and would be turning 35 this year.  She gave me advice and told me I didn't need a pap since I got one last year and prescribed some lab work to make sure they were within normal limits.  I then received a bill for $250 office visit and over $1000 lab and imaging bills because everything was coded at infertility which is not covered by my insurance.  I called multiple times to see what was going on since I went in for a routine visit and now they code everything so it's not picked up by my insurance.  Even sharp lab told me to postpone paying and call my insurance since routine lab work would be covered. That aspect was frustrating, but I can live with it except there's no direct way to talk to her or her staff and they take over 1 week to return phone calls to explain labs, costs, or next steps.  Dr. Goodwin is not hands on and responsive with her patients, but has no problem charging you an arm and a leg for a couple mins of her time.  Eventually her assistant will get back to you with a message from her, rather than the doctor herself, but the information is almost useless since I will have additional questions. Her assistant eventually escalated the matter to the office manager Letty.  I told her that would be great and give me a call back Friday since I am off and not juggling patients myself. She calls me back not on a Friday and leaves a message without introducing herself so I had to go in the most round about way to get a hold of her to express my billing concerns.  She left me a message on a issue that had already been resolved and I had a different billing question.  I called back in less than 5 mins before 5 pm and she still didn't pick up.  I have left two messages on separate days and still have not received a phone call back and it has been over a month.  I finally paid all my bills because I didn't want to get sent to collections and just made a change to take my business somewhere else. I would not recommend this place to anyone, even if I was not fond of them because their business standards are impersonal and beyond frustrating and no one deserves that kind of service.<//Review>

<review>You get rotatated to different doctors each visit. Personally I would have preferred to keep one doctor but they want you to meet the staff since they don't know who will be on call when you deliver. Dr. Ariel Shuckett delivered my baby and I couldn't of been happier. She was so nice and comforting my whole experience was that much nicer because of her. Thank you Dr. Shuckett</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Why have the option for expecting mother’s to ask questions when it’s not even going to be from a doctor but the receptionist herself? The receptionist (May) was so rude and ignorant, I had a question and she couldn’t even answer it, took a while and probably googled it as I awkwardly waited through the phone in silence.

Have been a patient for a VERY LONG TIME, but every time I call for an appointment at San Diego office I'm told they are booked up until next month and not taking appointments further out yet, but that I could go to CARLSBAD office which is many, many miles away for me.  They just really dont care. Shame on them!!!!!<//text>

<text>I had an overall OKAY experience with west coast OBGYN. there are two concerns that i want to address though. If you are pregnant and expect to see your OBGYN ever visit then this is not the place for you. for every visit i was seen by different nurses and nurse practitioners. i probably got to see my doctor twice out of the nine months going. it would have been good to talk to the person who is going to give birth to your baby but i didn't get a chance to do that. also during labor i was already dilated and i was ready to push but i wasn't able to push for another 30 mins because i had to wait for Dr. Goodwin. this caused by baby to go into stress and he had to be put on respiratory therapy so no one was able to cut his cord.. this is just a few things that need to be in consideration before you go here. other then that its a overal okay exsperience<//text><username>Mark billings<//username>< pictures>

BEWARE of West Coast OBGYN and Dr. Goodwin!!!  My wife and I are first time expectant parents and picked West Coast Obgyn and Dr. Goodwin because we thought that since they were next door to Sharp Medical Center (top rated in SoCal) they would be a good office.  NO SO!!!  First of all, one would expect when paying to see a licensed doctor / obgyn, you would see one, however, West Coast Obgyn makes it a business practice to use nurse practitioners and assistant nurses 90% of the time to consult and answer your questions.  My wife had had a miscarriage months back so we were very anxious to find out if our current pregnancy was healthy.  After sending us off to multiple expensive blood tests and ultrasounds (we are paying out of pocket, mind you), all we get is to speak with are the doctor's assistant nurses (not even nurse practitioners)--and I should mention that we had to hound their offices with calls three times a day before someone would call us back with results!!!

After over three weeks of mixed diagnosis, my wife FINALLY was able to speak with Dr. Goodwin who gave her a COMPLETELY different diagnosis than the previous nurses just days before.  And when my wife asked her why the diagnosis was so different and if there is something wrong with her pregnancy, Dr. Goodwin rudely snapped back 'how would she know, she wasn't the one who spoke with my wife last time'... My wife felt that Dr. Goodwin had absolutely no compassion towards her.  Her tone was irritated and that she just wanted to get off the phone.

After spending over a $1,000 in less than 3 weeks out of pocket, my wife and I are DONE with West Coast OBGYN. They obviously place making money by churning more patients through their doors WELL over caring for their patients as care givers.  My wife and I almost NEVER write reviews, but if this one will spare other people the pain we went through with West Coast OBGYN and Dr. Goodwin, then it was well worth the time.  We strongly feel we would have received better care and more compassion from a free clinic.< /Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>I am revising my review upward to 4 stars. Once I went up to the desk and asked about the status of my car they explained that they were backed up from a job that has gone from the day before. And their system had double book the 9 AM slot.  But the bottom line is once they paid attention to me and my situation they did the work in a timely efficient and friendly manner. I think that the online appointment system combined with the traditional telephone system is causing them to over book their appointments and causing more delays than would or should otherwise happen. So I think the corporate headquarters could do these outlets and their customers a favor by not overloading their people so heavily.</text>< pictures>

<review>brought my own tires from online purchase. They charged me 200 to have them installed. Then they had me waiting for over 3 hrs to get my car. They didn't even take the stickers off the tire and they valve stems were all in different positions.   I had to help them get the spare tire back after they were done.<//review><Rate>2</Rate><Gmap_id>0x80844a06cbd9977f:0x8ee188fda08d6c0e< /Gmap_id><userid>116721548354775379838<//userid><Response>{'time': 1614033319763, 'text': 'We are sorry we let you down this time, Kathleen.

<review>If I could give the Rohnert Park location more than 5 stars, I absolutely would. I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the service from every single person that works here! In October 2020, we were about to leave for a road trip and had an issue with our tire. They fit us in at the last second of the day, and stayed late to help us to ensure we could get on the road safely. Yesterday, I went back to have a quick check prior to another road trip and ended up running a little bit late (I was getting coffee and doughnuts for the team there because they are so great, but ended up waiting in the drive through line at Krispy Kreme for over half an hour!). I called to let them know I was running late, and Sandra was so friendly and kind, and told me not to worry. When I arrived, Emily came out to greet me at my car. She was awesome! My car was done in literally 10 minutes. This is also not the first location I have had a great experience with. The location in Los Banos helped me in a very similar situation, starting open late when I blew a tire on the I-5 back a few years ago. I've also had very good service at the Napa location. Bottom line, if you need ANYTHING tire related, go to Les Schwab!! Especially the Rohnert Park location!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>This is a great place to get tires! Every time I’ve come here the staff is very pleasant and helpful. Today was no exception. I blew a tire on the freeway. Very honestly they showed me the problem and explained. Everything was reasonable and taken care of quickly. Highly recommend this place!</Review>< gmapID>

I recently got my tires done here and was told it would take an hour or two at the most so I walked by after 90 minutes and my car was still where I parked it. They havent even touched it yet let alone start any actual work. It doesn't take 2 hours to change 4 tires I've done it myself. At least up hold your own words lol I'd understand if people called ahead of me but the entire time there's been empty stalls for other cars so they weren't that busy. Also let those in the future know that the time they quote you is not the time your car will actually be done. Its the time it takes before they even move your car into the short alone baby work being started. Very unprofessional and lazy with zero excuses for this. I highly recommend against anyone ever going here.< /Review>

Originally began bringing my car to the mo tgomery drive location however I'm working a few blocks from the RP location now. I've always had a great experience here. Everybody is genuine and prioritize my safety on the road. They're transparent in their decisions and I've in no way felt robbed EVER.
Thanks for the outstanding service and understanding everytime.<//text>

I went to the Rohnert Park location after having my tires rotated at the Santa Rosa location because I needed my front passenger tire balanced (because they forgot at S.R.). I left and got a call that “It was my alignment,” and $400 worth of other work... pffftt. 🙄

Took it back to S.R. And had my tire balanced no problem there. If this location tells you you need more work than you do, SEEK A SECOND OPINION.

Edit: Read a comment they’ve done this to other women, so maybe just don’t go there if you’re female? Because it sounds like they try to take advantage.<//review>

My only issue is the wait. Have time and make an appointment or prepare to drop off and pick up. Little above average on price but the warranty and continued support is why I like this place. Free hazzard repair. Freen rotation. Free evaluation of work with serveces. Once again great service and warranty.</Review>

I blew my tire out and called around. They were the most helpful location I spoke with. The woman who helped me at the front was very professional friendly and informative. The crew in the back was sufficient and quick. All that for the competitive prices I will be recommending then to friends and family.</text>

I had a great experience and Paul, the manager and his team was extremely patient with me (esp when I didn’t know where my wheel lock was). I’m not from Around here and I commute for the most part for work. As a first time customer, I am extremely happy with my experience here. Will be a returning customer to this location when I’m in this area and needing help again.< /text>

<Review>My roommate told me this was the place to get tires and I took her suggestion. Not a terrible price for tires and they give a student discount BUT they definitely tried ripping me off big time. Both my friend and I have Honda Accords, different years, and we both got our tires here but when we asked to get an alignment they said they couldn't due to policy because our "shocks and struts were bad." I totally understand employees have to follow policy but once they said the work would be $1000 + red flags went up. How ironic they would tell both of us the same thing? I asked on the phone how bad the shocks and struts were and he said not bad but when I went in another employee told me it was urgent and I needed them replaced immediately but he would lower the price. I told him I'd never had any signs they were bad and he got very defensive and rude and said "he didn't like being called a liar," which I never said. He was very pushy so I paid for my tires and left. I took my car to a Honda dealer and they checked my shocks and struts and said they were just fine and did the alignment right there. It makes me sad that they tried taking advantage of me and of my friend because we are women. Also it really sucks having to pay your way through college and have people try to rip you off. I will not be returning.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1487925770581</Date><rating>1</rating><response>{'time': 1488211789397, 'text': 'This really concerns us, and we apologize.

< Review>
Before calling in I made sure to read the reviews and from reading the reviews it seemed like it was a decent tire shop. Until I called in and was treated with poorly service via phone. Which is the saddest thing for I was not expecting to get terrible customer service through the phone. But at least I did not waste my time and gas on driving there to get poorly and terrible customer service.  The worst thing is that the person who I was on the phone with was the manager Manny. I did not expect to get terrible customer service from a manager. I do wonder now how he manages the store. Anyhow, when I called he was rude and told me that in order to make an appointment I needed to do it 24 hours in advance. However, nowhere on their website does it say you MUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT 24 hours IN ADVANCE. So a heads up on their website would have been nice instead of me wasting time on calling and getting no HELP. I find it ironic that on their website it says "We love walk-ins, so come by any time" but yet I was told I needed to make an appointment to get help.  I should of just never called but walked instead, but I bet I would have gotten the same result; terrible customer service. Lastly, when he told me I needed to make an appointment I went on and asked nicely if he could schedule me for tomorrow but he did not even let me finish my sentence and rushed me by saying you must do it online, everything is done online so do it online. It seems very pushy and unprofessional for it would have taken him less than 10 mins to schedule me like I was already on the phone with him so he could have simply done it right there and than. But sadly that was not the case. Now I am starting to think that all these reviews posted about how good of a tire shop they are is bogus. They probably create fake accounts and write their own reviews just to get customers. I am never going to call or try to get help from them and I will spread the word. So I can save people the trouble of dealing with poor customer service.< /Review>

Had a flat on my 66 mustang a few month back. I took it here for 4 new tires. They mounted them for me which took a bit longer than expected but all seemed well. After I left however my hubcap popped of less than a block away and went flying across the road nearly causing an accident with oncoming cars. I went back to ask for a bit of money back $5 I figured was fair as it seems like they just made a small mistake. The assistant manager was a JERK. He wouldn't give me anything and insinuated it was my problem. I asked for the manager and he claimed to be it. I however already knew who it was as It was listed on the website for the store. He was not happy when I called him on it. The manager for the day did me right and was very polite. However I'm not sure if the messed my wheel up or what because that hub cap continues to pop off now so I am currently not driving with it on.</Review>

<Review>I had a Hertz rental with a low tire and a foreign object in the tread.  No Hertz place listed in Rohnert Park.  Took it here because this was near my hotel and had good reviews.  They fixed it free.  FREE. In about an hour, less time than it would have taken me to drive to a Hertz place and do the paperwork.  When the guy saw my surprise that it was free, he said, "Oh yeah, that's something we do for our (indecipherable) customers."  I was afraid to ask him to repeat it, but I am glad I was one of them, whoever they are.  I told my son who lives nearby to please use these people when he needs tires.<//Review>< pictures>

They tried to justify $400 for a brake repair on ONE axle. The front one. Not even the slightly complicated axle. I understand most auto shops use brake-repairs as a money-grabbing opportunity but $400 is just too much. And if you've ever replaced brake pads before, you know how frustrating that number is. When I tried to negotiate it down the got very unprofessional, and salty about it. The front lady was very condescending when I told her I didn't think replacing the calipers was necessary. I do not recommend this establishment for brake-repairs.<//Text>

Although i had to go back because of a blow out on my trailer, Manny and the crew at Les Schwab in Rohnert Park have been very professional.  I agree with some posts that the ladies in the front could be a bit more "friendly" but as far as handling business, they have been great.< /text>

< Review>
Went in to get my wheel patched since it had a nail and a small screw in it. I was offered a brake check  free of charge so I thought why not. HORRIBLE DECISION!!!!! They said it was going to take an hour and a half, No big deal thats normal. not 1 1/2 hours.... 3 hours later!!!!  my car is finished and pulled back into the parking lot. They tell me that during the brake check 2 of my lug nuts were broken (one on the Front right and one on the back right). so they were going to replace them for free. I thought "this shouldnt take too long its just lug nuts this is a tire shop". 30 mins go by and they finally send someone out to put the new 2 lug nuts onto my wheels. TURNS OUT ONE OF THE BOLTS FOR THE LUG NUT IS STRIPPED!!!?!?!?!? THis is a free brake check mind you... at a TIRE SHOP. these people should be able to change out a tire without stripping the bolts for the lug nuts. Guy that put bolts on says one is stripped but says nothing helpful and almost walks away with one of the lug nuts. Now I have to re thread the bolt..... WHICH THEY DIDNT OFFER TO DO! or even try to recommend a place to go and get that dealt with. He expected me to just drive away without the 2 new lug nuts on my car at all  and I looked at him jaw dropped. I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE.<//Review>

I was told it would be 1 hour to 11/2 hour wait to get my tires rotated.  I have been here 3 hours and no one has even so much as looked at my truck. More people answering  the phone than actually working on vehicles. HORRIBLE SERVICE.<//text>

<Text>Very poor service. People at front desk had no idea what they were doing and kept having to get help from people working in the back. I waited over an hour for roadside assistance to help change a tire less than 100 yards from their store. I finally had to call someone else for assistance.</Text>< user>

Went here for the first time a few weeks ago! The food is delectable!!! We ordered multiple things but were lucky enough to learn about an off the menu item that we ordered twice that night, 805 roll(?).  Unless it isn't profitable, it should definitely be on the menu! Our server was amazing as well! Oku was her first serving job and she started when they opened. Can't say enough good things about her (sorry I can't remember her name). Can Keegan did a great job with our drinks!!!<//Text>

Really friendly, attentive service.  We had nigiri sushi of all kinds and they were all fresh.  No need for much seasoning or sauce of any kind.  Loved the location and the view upstairs was great< /Text>

Came here a few months ago and enjoyed my experience. Had some family visiting from out of town, and thought it’d be a great place to have lunch. We had booked a reservation online for a party of 4. When we arrive, we get seated at a table for 2. When clarifying that we had booked the reservation for 4, the gentleman had declined and said that’s not what it said on his end. We inquired approximately how long it’d take to accommodate a party of 4 (although we shouldn’t have to convene, he should’ve came up with a solution). After showing him the reservation on our end that it was a party of 4 we had booked, he mumbled a few words and just stood still. After expressing how upset I was, and that we would just find lunch elsewhere, there wasn’t any remorse, regret, or ounce of sincerity after, which is why we ultimately left. I didn’t feel comfortable being served in a restaurant where there was such a LACK of basic hospitality. When I had called later to speak to someone, it was the General Manager that had picked up and whom I had dealt with prior, Enrique. As opposed to listening to my frustration and why, he was short and very defensive, and stated that we just left and that he was gonna move some tables around to make it work. My problem is that it could’ve been communicated in a much more elevated manner, and to just listen. Why would I want to be serviced with someone combating me from the get go? What’s the point of booking reservations in advance if they’re just going to fight you when you arrive, and then give attitude afterwards, especially from the General Manager of all people. All in all, wish them the best with their business, and hope they are a bit friendlier going forward.</Review>

Oku has great sushi.
You'll pay the premium for the beachfront view and the Funk Zone vibe though there are certainly some other sushi joints in town that can get you better sushi for a better price. That said, if you're itching to feel like you're a part of the Santa Barbara scene and want a stellar meal then this is probably what you're looking for.</Text>

Went to Oku for my girlfriend’s birthday (5/3/21). Just the two of us on a Monday night. It wasn’t terribly busy, but they said they had to seat us inside because the three open tables outside were reserved. Waiter Nick was a little slow to greet us, but we didn’t wait too long. Ordered a bottle of wine and the Korean cauliflower (which is a little spicy and excellent).
Went on to order two rolls and two plates of sashimi all at Nick’s suggestion (thanks Nick!).  But here is where the issues begin.
Apparently, we were given the wrong menu, we had an outdated one from days earlier, so the prices were wrong. However, the prices were only off by a few dollars. No big deal right?
The bigger issue is that the menu itself is very confusing and feels a little like a trick.
According to the waiter and manager (after we received our bill and questioned it) there are two parts to one section of the menu, one for nigiri and one for sashimi and the prices for the fish are meant to reflect the difference. However, the menu is set up this way:
14 Toro  -  Tuna Belly 38
12 Hon Maguro  -  Blue Fin Tuna 30
Etc.  (see picture of the menu)
To our surprise the numbers next to the fish are not actually their prices. The numbers on the left are for the nigiri and the price on the right is for the sashimi for BOTH FISH on the line.
That fact was not explained to us and caused quite a bit of confusion when it came to figuring out the bill.
None of this would have been that bad if they had apologized and done the right thing of giving us the expected prices. We wouldn’t have ordered the second sashimi in the first place if we had known the pricing set up as we were already full. If they had done the right thing, we would happily return to the restaurant, but they didn’t and we won’t.
Finally, when ordering the rolls we asked if we could get the Tuna roll regular instead of spicy, and it turns out that it costs two dollars extra, but this isn’t on the menu.
In the end, a nice night ends with a blip of frustration all over multiple screw ups with a menu. Oh well.< /text>

Food is Japanese cuisine. The Conchs de tu madre, aka the scorpion cup is worth it. Make sure you split the cup.< /review>

<username>Kristina Platonoff</username><Resp>None<//Resp><Review>The crispy Korean cauliflower appetiter was the best I've ever had, not too spicy, it tasted as if it was airfried with a light batter on it and Korean sauce. The albacore sashimi just melted in your mouth, the fish was so fresh. We also ordered the wild mushroom ramen, a little buttery for me but still delicious. The yo Adrian sushi roll was perfectly made and the cut of each roll was a good size to eat. We also ordered the momo Kawa pearl saki (make sure you shake the bottle) and beer , next time will go for the cocktails.

Oku was delicious, and a great place for a covid-safe dining experience. We sat on the upstairs patio, in a place sheltered from the wind, and with great heat lamps. It was warm enough to take my jacket off! The sushi was delicious, and so was dessert. Even their mocktails were good! And a tip - if you get the spanish mackerel, you'll get an extra treat at the end of your meal. A great Saturday night dinner experience!</text>

<Text>Delicious. It was so nice to go out, so much so that I even appreciated the table in the back by the kitchen. Heh. The restaurant had a two patio areas with tables sufficiently separated. Service was efficient, helpful and pleasant. Enjoyed the soft shell crab with spicy mayo and a side of cucumber salad (not traditional Japanese pickled cucumber which would have been nice). The crab in the shrimp and crab gyoza was fresh and succulent. The soy dipping sauce for both of these dishes was said to have truffle though I couldn't taste that. There's a beef gyoza that will be on my list for my next visit. Also ordered a salmon lollipop. Really yummy. Thinking this may become a take away order on a regular basis when I want a nice snack. Lastly, ordered a tequila cocktail with lychee fruit that was sublime with a hint of heat (may seem like a lot of heat for those who are sensitive) that balanced the flavor nicely.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Very good meal with a not so huge price tag.  Everything was very flavorful.  The only miss step was there was no sauce on my wife Piranha roll so it was dry.  She asked about a sauce and Spicy Mayo was suggested and make the roll just right.  I would recommend this place to anyone who likes good sushi in a pleasant atmosphere.  The staff was awesome and we even got in when they were booked for the night.  I would recommend a reservation but even without our hostess was able to get us in, in under 30 minutes and we were about the 5th party in line without a reservation.  GET the Crispy Korean Cauliflower.<//Review><GmapID>0x80e9138c25baaaab:0x105ceb813a43cbe</GmapID>< Rating>

Not just a pretty place. While the view and surroundings may be one of the reasons you go, the food is the reason you will come back. The night started off with a couple of sushi roll’s which were fresh and amazing. I Highly recommend the piranha for a little spice in your life. I had a bottle of cab that I wanted to open so we ordered the best 2 pairings. The filet mignon and the Korean short rib. OH MY. The short rib is one one of the best things to over wonder into my oral orifice that I call a mouth. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was great for any steak lover, but the Korean flavored short rib could not be beaten. To top it off our server Keegan made it a fun and welcoming environment. Highly recommend this place for all. (Not just sushi lovrs)< /Text>

What more could you ask for for the best seafood and beautiful sushi and Asian dishes with a view  of the ocean?  Fantastic sushi . Try that noodle yakisoba -for gluten free people they have a Rice and noodle version which is killer for shrimp steak or chicken.  Seafood lollipops with halibut, shrimp and crab are amazing . Drinks are beautiful and being by the sea is the best.  Go upstairs and see the beautiful views of the harbor well eating the best yummiest food ! don’t miss it.< /Text>

<review>While visiting Santa Barbara we stumbled across Oku. We were so thankful that they got us in for an early dinner! Sara took great care of us. My boyfriend, the Lare Bear even broke out of his norm and enjoyed his first steamed edamame, sushi lollipop, and maki roll. The food was on point and the service was perfect! Thank you to Sara and the team at Oku for breaking my boyfriends sushi cherry and creating a memorable experinece for us!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This is not your typical sushi restaurant. They have some pretty high end entres and drinks here. Some of the rolls include wagyu beef and other unique ingredients. Upstairs is an outside patio with a pretty epic bar. They sometimes have growing pains in organization of the floor and service, but we have had good experiences both times we have gone.< /Text>

An absolutely fantastic dining experience. The menu is perfect, the service is impeccable,  and the experience is impressive. Henry took great care of us today, and his recommendations (pink Cadillac roll - eel avocado and cucumber) were exactly what we wanted. And the wings are fire!

Thank you for a great anniversary dinner,  guys.<//Review>

I’m a bit shocked at all the high reviews here.
We saw all the high ratings and figured since we were staying a block away we had to try it.

We were seated 40 minutes late (we arrived 10 minutes late in their defense), but the reasoning for it being 40 minutes was they gave our table away. It made no sense to me personally as we had called prior to let them know we were running late, so why give our table to someone else when we showed up within a normal grace period?

What my rating really came down to were 2 things, the food is mediocre and the people working there seemed like they could care less that we were customers.

I don’t expect a lot when I go to a restaurant but I’d appreciate acting like you care about your job. Once we sat down after waiting 30 minutes I pointed out that one of the small serving plates was sticky/dirty, and the waitress didn’t even apologize about it.

We over ordered, and the waitress didn’t even drop a hint of a warning that “Hey, this is actually kind of a lot of food”. We had never been there before, we weren’t familiar with portion size. We ended up having a ton of leftovers that we just couldn’t finished and could have easily done without.

All that said, the food was pretty bleh. We ordered what ended up being a lot of food and it all came out in under 20 minutes, which in my opinion says something about how they’re cooking it. Likely frozen. I’d just avoid this place overall.</text>

Sushi is good quality, location is great but the service is severely lacking. I've been back multiple times because of the fresh fish but always let down by how long it always takes to even have your drink order taken. Once I order my drink I don't get it until the meal arrives. Which doesn't make any sense to me because I would have ordered a second one by then. I've found that it doesn't matter how many people are there, the service is always slow. One of the managers I found very rude.< /text>

Excellent dining experience, at great prices for ocean front dining. Professional service. Creative, beautifully executed cuisine. Santa Barbara needs more restaurants which deliver this level of quality for a reasonable price. Look out Four Seasons, San Ysidro Ranch!!!

We made reservations at their recommendation and they were right on time, however, we had to wear masks even at our table unless we were eating. The server took forever to get our order even though the place wasn't that crowded, and they explained that there was enough food to share even though the portions were small. After 1/2 hour we finally got our drinks, and another 20 minutes to get served. The food was "ok" but nothing spectacular, and the portions were very very small. For a family of 3 the price was over $130. Not worth the wait and not worth the price. I won't  recommend this place to anyone.</text>

<Text>This restaurant is a Japanese fusion style that offers sushi and entrees. We really enjoyed the salmon carpaccio! The firecracker rock shrimp was good but not as flavorful. Our waiter recommended the cauliflower dish which was outstanding and unique! And we finished our meal with the Way of the Dragon roll which was delicious if you like cream cheese in your roll. Overall this new restaurant was sensational and they offer complimentary valet. We will definitely be back!< /Text>< GmapID>

My only suggestion for Oku is to make the Matcha Creme Brûlée larger...and perhaps offer it as an entree.  Would be 7 stars if so. With that said..If you are planning to order it for dessert, order several, do not make the same mistake as I did.

Everything else was ridiculously good too..but please make entree sized Creme brûlées.  Thank you!<//text>

This restaurant has unbelievable sushi! I have been raving about them since they opened. A few weeks ago we ordered Grubhub to our door and the experience was very disappointing. My wife and we’re so sad that the quality was so compromised we didn’t think we would ever go there again. Today I called the staff to share our experience we encountered and wanted to know if it was just that day or if the COVID 19 shut down was causing the quality of the fish to be less then expected. To be honest, I could not believe the response. It was immediate satisfaction that they wanted for me. They explained that it was a major adjustment to go from always busy to to go orders only and it was a major adjustment to order the freshest fish in such smaller amounts. Not only did they serve us up the best sushi order to go that we have ever had! They refused to let me pay for our order today. We are big sushi eaters and the experience we had today has definitely changed our attitudes towards this establishment. The entire team rose to the occasion to take care of us today including the owners, sushi chef, management team, hostess etc. Thank you for taking care of us today!!! Absolutely amazing!

Service was speedy but not well-informed.  Pot of Green tea was only Luke-warm .  Sushi was very fresh and tasty, but we had to ask for a knife to cut the lightly cooked Bok Choy, which was too hard and large to be eaten with chopsticks.</review>

This place hasn't figured out how to provide service.  Waited 10 minutes after being seated before a waiter offered water or asked if we wanted a drink.  Don't bother coming here until they figure out how to operate a restaurant.  Food was ok but 2 scallops for $16, REALLY!  I live in Santa Barbara and will spend my money somewhere else.</Text>

My Margarita cost $21.00 and the service was very slow. I was very excited to try this place out after all the hype, but it didn't live up to the publicly. Very limited menu!!! We were invited back and had a total different experience. The staff were much, much better. An overall completely different experience from our first experience. Will now highly recommend!! Just goes to show you how a truly great resturant handles adversity!!! Hats off to you guys!!!<//review>

Stunning setting, great service and absolutely delicious food. The Wagyu beef was well worth the price - melt in your mouth goodness with a variety of accompanying sauces. We will be back.< /review>

Crispy Korean Cauliflower is fantastic! Their edamame has an amazing spicy flavor. Nigiri was large piece of fish. 4 stars because the sushi rolls didn't quite hit the mark. We went within their opening week, had a great experience; would go back.</Review>

<Review>I love Keegan! Our waiter/bartender was awesome! He pointed us toward the cauliflower which was also recommended by 2 other people we had come across that day, and of course, it was amazing! He made some decent old fashioneds too! I'd reccomend asking for something other then a Japanese whiskey though, I think that made it kind of sub par. The spider roll was great but I will go for things other then rolls next time. I think they focus more on nigiri or sashimi and the rolls seem kind of like an after thought or something they have to do to appease people. All the appetizers looked extremely yummy though! Keegan also was a great help in getting cash to tip the valet!</Review>< pictures>

Be ready to wait 30 minutes outside your reservation. Be ready for all of your food to be delivered at once. Be ready for little to no service afterward.<//Text>

Great sushi.  Really good cocktails  Cool vibe.
Swanky interior. Architecture by the same firm who did Flor de Maiz next door.   If you're heading there for dinner, check out the upstairs outside patio.  Dont worry about it being cold, plenty of heaters.  They will also provide you with blankets for your lap! Extremely knowledgable service staff.  One of the brightest spots for dinner along the water that doesnt involve being out on the pier<//Text>

< Review>
A bit of a rough start in the first weekend of their opening. Overall the food was good. One suggestion I have for the sushi chef is to please refrain from serving the sashimi on a bed of icecubes. By the 3rd piece I found the rest drowning in water from the half melted ice cubes, which was a bit of a turn off. Flavors are on on point yet they can hold back on the oil in when prepping the fried rice.<//Review>

<text>I took my daughter here on a Sunday afternoon and scored a great table on the balcony overlooking East Beach. We shared a sashimi salad, 3 a-la-carte sushi dishes (roe, yellowtail, and octopus) and a large soft shell crab roll. With 2 beers, the total came to $100, including the 20% tip. Not bad. Not cheap. But not exorbitant either. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and felt satisfied (full, in a good way) afterwards.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80e9138c25baaaab:0x105ceb813a43cbe<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful ambiance and you have your choice of comfortable inside dining, including two different bars, or a lower patio and a rooftop patio with great views of the waterfront. Dogs are welcome on the lower patio. The fusion menu is varied and interesting, utilizing top-notch ingredients and artful presentations. The wine list is small, but includes a number of good choices. One side of the menu is traditional and modern-interpretation sushi and rolls, while another side of the menu features a number of interesting dishes which are Asian in concept. We ordered the A5 Wagyu that came with five different dipping sauces and grated REAL Japanese wasabi, plump pork gyoza, Saigon chicken wings, halibut & crab "lollipops", shrimp bao "sliders" (more like tacos) , and sticky beef salad. With the exception of the bao sliders whose shrimp filling was pretty "fishy tasting", and the sticky beef, which was rather dry and bland, the food was excellent. Friendly and efficient service throughout the meal. A fine new addition to the Santa Barbara dining scene and certainly one of the best restaurants in town.< /Review>

< review>
Roger gets a C minus for empathy and an F for bedside manner.  I have seen him several times and have left the practice frustrated and confused, and sometime really offended.   Roger is condescending and somewhat arrogant. This means that he can not imagine a world in which a patient might come into his office who is well-informed, interested in a two way conversation and might actually have something helpful to contribute to the consultation.   I find they Roger predictably second guesses and interrogates a patient for daring to have some type of vague opinion about their diagnosis.   Worst of all, Roger completely dismisses the idea that you are going their to talk about YOUR body and you have every right to have an opinion. - and an adult respectful conversation about your health.</review>

Great friendly staff, our MA was great. She was very knowledgeable and helpful in offering services and being hands on with out being squeamish or look at me like I'm a monster. Above all she treated me like a human as did the staff. Which made my experience rewarding. I'm absolutely a happy customer and I now look forward to my next visit.</review>

Met with Roger for the first time today....He impressed me with his professionalism and knowledge of ideas on the best way to address my medical concerns.  He took a totally painless biopsy and informed me we will make choices on ways to proceed when the results come back....I was very impressed with the office and have every confidence that I've found my new dermatologist!  Also, the appointment was right on time, no waiting!</review>

Everything was so easy! Calling to set up an appointment was quick, reminders and check ins made it easier to not forget or loose track of time. As well as easy online patient registration/info forms through email. The experience on site was even better, only waited about 10-12 minutes max and was seen, given a diagnosis and course of action, checked out, and scheduled for a follow up within 5 minutes. I have already recommended Dr. Bellamy and West Dermatology in general to family and I will defiantly be a return patient!<//Review>

First visit.  Was 15 minutes early, but not called in until 10 mins after appointment.  Not an issue, but noteworthy.  Friendly staff.  Clean facility.  Will definitely be back and my wife will be making an appointment soon as well.  Probably my daughter too............< /Review>

I was so very impressed with the organization and promptness of making an appointment, checking in, exam with the tech and the doctor and the check out process. I felt extremely comfortable (even though I were a little nervous). The doctor was so kind, patient and humorous. He really made me feel at ease. The tech was outstanding. She knew the answer to every question I had and was very patient with me, as well. I would highly recommend this practice to anyone in need of a Dermatologist. Thank you!<//Review>

The Advanced Practice Provider, Roger Bellamy, P.A., always provides me with excellent dermatologic medical care. He is professional, efficient, personable, and communicative. He instructs me about what I need to do to take proper care of my skin. ("The sun is good for you, but getting sunburning is very bad. Melanoma is easy to resolve if we catch it early. It is deadly if we do not see you and therefore cannot treat it timely.") He is an advocate of a 6-month skin cancer check. This is important to me due to my having suffered severe, blistering sunburns in my childhood and teenage years, and my having a lot of freckles and moles that need to be watched. Roger answers all of my questions and provides me with information related to whatever issues I may have. I appreciate the high level of care he consistently provides.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Overall, a very easy annual visit.  Came in, checked in, was seen by Dr. Bellamy, who froze off a few spots, and then I went home.  Was told that if anything came back and /or bothered me, I should come back in 4 to 6 months.  Otherwise, good for another year.

They seem to do a good job, and the office is close and convenient.< /Text>< resp>

<Review>I preferer email I appreciated the most. not having to wait too long to check in.The girls at the front desk were very friendly, courteous, and prompt. I also enjoyed Jaime's attention to my issue. taking the time to give me the names of several lotions that Roger thought I should be using.  Additionally,Roger was also prompt, and direct. I liked that he was able to ascertain my diagbosis, and give me a recommendation. without having to wait too long.</Review>< Pics>

All his staff were great! From my 1st call to make my appointment to registering and answering the new patient questionnaire online to making my follow up appointment.
Also, I have new health insurance that I’ve never heard of  so I couldn’t really answer their questions pertaining to my insurance provider. But again they were patient and helped me through the process... Myrna<//text>

After finding out it was an allergic reaction to Mobic. The outbreak and rash all over his arms and ankles. So I was not going to come here but decided to give it a try. And we are both glad I did and we did. He was really anxious about coming but I talked him into it.

The saturday hours were what made the case for me.  I get zero time off from my job even for medical appts, so it's without pay if I do it during the week.  Saturday hours are huge.  Very patient-friendly and convenient, and the registration process can be done ahead of time and all online.< /Text>

Roger is not only a top professional, he took the time to talk to me. I felt I was treated by a real human being instead of a "medical roboter".  THANK YOU Roger, can't wait to come back!❣️< /review>

<Response>None<//Response><review>Loved Roger. He was reassuring before the procedure of having what I thought was a lipoma removed. Unfortunately it was something different. I was on my side during procedure so couldn’t see. He continually kept talking to me during the procedure. Wish he could have waited until the dressing was applied before he left for the assistant to provide the dressing and bandage. But in fairness he had other patients and wasn’t prepared to remove it but did bc I asked if he pleaSe would. His response was perfect, “ At West Dermatology we aim to keep the patient satisfied.” Would recommend him to anyone in need.<//review>< time>

I went in for a Cancer screening and was a disaster. Mr.Bellamy was in and out in a minute..I asked a question about my diagnosis he replied make another appointment.. This was very unprofessional..His staff screwed up the Insurance paper work and now have turned over the account to a credit collection agency..I'm tired of dealing with this issue and unprofessional people at West Dermatology and Mr. Bellamy should develop some People skills..A real Negative experience..👎 👎 👎 👎 👎< /text>

West Derm/Roger Bellamy, PA provided excellent, thorough care, giving attention to all patient questions & concerns. I received stellar healthcare from all of the staff I encountered. Mr. Bellamy was courteous, professional, attentive & pleasant (in a very human/genuine way). I was VERY satisfied with all aspects of my visit & highly recommend West Derm & Roger Bellamy, PA.

Guys are rude to you and talk to you as if their doing you a favor.  I didn't pawn or sell my stuff here after all.  It was just stuff that I didn't need or use.  Tools, TV's and jewelry.  I recommend for you to just sell your unused stuff on Offer Up or maybe even eBay.  Because dealing with people like this isn't good for anyone.  That or maybe try another pawn shop.  But remember that these people will low ball you very hardcore.  Not worth it in my opinion.<//Review>

Had a great experience shopping at this pawn shop. Everyone is super friendly and have all the answers for you with all the interesting things for sale. Oscar was a lot of help when I came in asking for a certain item and gave me a 5 star sale. Thank you again, will be looking foward to do more business with you guys!</Review>

Came across Mr. Steve’s Pawn Shop on Offer Up when I was in search for a new camera bag. I reached out and got a few of my questions answered quickly. Oscar was my point of reference which he demonstrated great customer skills as he patiently worked with me on a day to meet up with him to retrieve the bag. He was super flexible with me! In the end Oscar took care of me with a great deal for the bag. For any of your needs Mr. Steve’s and Oscar are your people/place to go to.<//Text>

Mr. Steve’s Pawn Shop is the best there is. Not only are they genuinely nice people, they also are way more helpful than any other pawn shop I have been too. I have confidence when I go in that I will be receiving the best service and not being taken advantage of. LOVE this place!</review>

Used to be a nice legit place to pawn your items and feel secured in the fact that they wouldn't lose or misplaced your items. Unfortunately, when I received my items back they took my cameras original charger, flash and camera bag and replaced them with cheaper versions. I called in hopes of getting it figured out but it's been almost a year without a call back (obviously). It really sucks because I really trusted this place and I'm still upset this happened to me.< /Text>

The customer service there is superb and it goes well beyond expectations. I’ve been buying jewelry from these guys for the last five years and I always get my moneys worth because the jury after I do get it appraise it’s either it’s value or more than its value and I like that kind of business. The security is even a sweetheart and Mr. Steve is a great guy very compassionate and patient . All in all  great service , great products , great prices , great people thanks guys see you again Xoxo -Briana<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Love this place. They have always been probably the most professional Pawn Shop I've ever been too. The staff is nothing but friendly and respectful. They are always willing to help out and don't treat you like you are a burden to their day. Even today, Alan helped me and was nothing but a nice guy. Definitely worth checking out this place.< /review>

<Review>Best pawn shop throughout all of Southern Cali. I was able to find exactly what I needed and at the best price. Extremely satisfied with their service as they did not rush me like other pawn shops but instead they make sure to make you feel comfortable and happy with your decision. Will highly recommend them to everyone as you will be completely satisfied.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I’m grateful for this spot! When I’m in a bind & need to pawn for emergency they’re always professional, honest & take good care of my items. Daniel makes this Pawn Shop top notch — always makes the less thrilling action of pawning a bit more pleasant.

Thank you Mr.Steves!!< /review>

Mr. Steve’s pawn shop has a variety of jewelry selections to choose from. You can always find what you’re looking for and you won’t be disappointed. Customer service is excellent ! All the employees are helpful and welcoming. Especially Q, he was very knowledgeable in his job and well mannered. There wasn’t a time where I felt pressured. He made my shopping experience extremely enjoyable. Definitely recommend him. Overall great pawn shop, and I’ll be visiting again !</review>

<text>Don’t waste your time coming to this place. Drove 30 minutes here went here based on good reviews. Guy just took a look at my merchandise said he would pass not even give me an offer.

I can't count how many different shops I've been to and I never get more cash for my stuff than I do at Mr Steves. All the people I've done business with there are easy going and respectful. Whether I need extra cash or want to treat myself I know they are there and will always be my #1 stop.</Review>< pics>

Steve's pawnshop is the beat in town, when i walk in Steve and Danny always greet me with hey smiley, all the other guys are really helpful, the prices are great, with a big selection, Steve also gives back to the cummunity, evey year Steve is handing out turkey alone with Jackson limousine. Great place to stop by ans check it out for yourself.</review>

<review>I'm a professional photographer and I purchased a very high end camera body ($5,000+) from them.  The transaction was handled professionally and timely.  I had a tight deadline and they shipped the camera to me ASAP and it was packaged very well.   The reason I decided to buy from them was because 1) excellent price and 2) the great reviews/ratings I saw online.  This is the first time I've ever bought something from a pawn shop and was concerned, my opinions coming from TV and/or movies.  Well I can tell you movies and/or TVs shows don't do justice to Steve's Pawn Shop.  They are a first rate business and I will buy from them again. The reviews and ratings you are seeing are there because Steve, store owner, follows through and oversees his operation.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I have been a customer of Steve's for over 17 yrs. I refuse to buy jewelry from anywhere but Steve's. Front my first experience  until now the atmosphere has always been the same very friendly and welcoming.  I always find something unique and reasonably priced. The jewelry stores can't compare to steves. If your in LA you must stop by highly recommended</Text>

One of the best pawn shops in the Los Angeles area hands down. They gave me exactly what I was I was looking for. Left out a very happy customer. Will do business with them again, always will be my first stop. Go in you won't be disappointed.<//text>

I still can't believe what they did to me in this place and I would like to know if someone can help me, I found this pawn shop on my way and seeing that it was the family I saw on TV I trusted to pawn my gold chain because  I had a bad night and my money and cards were stolen and I needed to take gas I had my car of the year parked outside and I decided to enter my chain valued at more than $ 3000 and they offered me $ 500 I took them two days back and page but they gave me a chain  thinner and smaller I asked the boy who attended but he said no that that was it and until today every time I wear my chain I remember you because my brooch you left it the same and it comes to me in front of me like it was  a medal and it hurts because I am a hardworking person and it is hard for me to buy my things they are already millionaires but now I understand why I am going to the store because I want them to invent that day I looked at myself unveiled and emaciated talcwz so they thought that  I was a street girl but no and I was robbed because of my appearance< /review>

They are pretty fair with their prices. They are also open from 6am until midnight. After 6pm you have to go to the window.<//text>

On Friday the 1st, of May 2015, I wanted some urgent cash, so I went to this Pawn shop base on the reviews in order to pawn two rings, a wedding band set and a diamond multi diamond engagement ring. There was a Mexican guy who was provided service. He offer me $25.00 on each of the rings. Later I went to another pawn shop and I got more than 4 times the amount on one of the rings as a result I only needed to pawn one of the rings.

I don't know if it was just the Spanish guy who was dishonest or if he was just following the tradition or the culture of the business. However I am saying to keep far away from this place if you don't want to be ripped off. Trust me I knows.</Text>
