<review>The most professional, most painless experience in my life.  The staff was kind and on point the entire visit.  The atmosphere was pleasant. I really enjoyed my interactions with my dentist and my hygenist.  They answered all my questions and gave me relevant suggestions for managing my real life with dentures. I would recommend them to anyone, especially if you have anxiety about seeing a dentist.  They put my mind at ease, and I felt like I could just focus on my treatment.  Thank goodness!< /review>< Pics>

<Time>1618591964061<//Time><Review>Brought my Mom to the Hayward Clinic for the first time and we are pleasantly surprised! The clinic is very clean. The Staff are very pleasant—from Front Office to Back Office. Unfortunately I didn’t catch the name of the Dentist that saw my Mom. But she was confident about her diagnosis and recommendations which we appreciate. Maritza (Hygienist), Stephanie, Bernie and the young lady at the reception (so sorry I didn’t get your name) were also very pleasant and helpful. It was overall an awesome experience.
Thank you Bright Now!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼</Review>< gmapID>

As someone with no dental insurance it is difficult to find a good quality, fairly priced dentist (even with dental insurance it was difficult!). Bright Now! offers a great discount plan and more importantly they work with you to create a plan without pushing you to do procedures that you cannot afford. I met with the manager, multiple dentists and technicians and they were all great, non-judgmental, and caring. The front desk attendants are wonderful! I drive 30+ minutes to come here because it is worth it.

I am meeting with their specialist and will update my review after.<//text><user_name>Erika Yeates</user_name>< Date>

Bright Now! diagnosed me with periodontal disease requiring quarterly cleaning and antibiotic.  After going through a couple treatments, and being told that it was still very inflamed, they wanted more treatments and x rays!  I declined the X-ray and the dentist got very rude at that point, saying that they cannot do a cleaning without an X-ray.  After that, I switched over to a different dental group. My current dentist said I didn't have periodontal disease and didn't require all those extensive cleaning.  The dentists here only want your money.  If you want an honest dentist, go elsewhere.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Garbo Tsui< /username>< UserId.>

I was very impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff. The  Dental Assistance who took my FMX was so friendly, and knew exactly what she was doing. The Dentist, came in and was very informative and went  straight to the point, which I appreciated. I am looking forward to going back.<//Review>

<name>JoseG ReyesJr<//name><Text>I had a tooth pulled that was infected and my experience with your dentist was    excruciating and extremely painful! The dentist was blaming the infection as the cause of pain, but it was not. It was the lack of time for the anesthesia to take effect.
At the start, the assistant rubbed the area of my infected tooth to numb it, prior to the anesthetic injection. Very soon after about 2 minutes, the dentist started injecting me, which was painful before my gum was numbed. About a minute after, the dentist started pulling my tooth before the anesthesia took effect. Extracting my tooth was a struggle that it splintered when I looked at my tooth. I began to feel an excruciating pain and when I told the dentist, was blaming my infected tooth. But to me, it was because she was in a hurry and rushed the job without giving time for the anesthesia to work. She asked if I need more injection but I refused to avoid overdose that would make me groggy to drive home.
The pain subsided late that nite after I took  the painkiller that was prescribed
Let this be a warning to others who want  tooth extraction at this office.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the best dental office that I have ever been too. The staff is very courteous, professional, and well organized.

My favorite thing about them is that they have a lot of specialists packed into a concise location whom care a lot about their patients!

She's definitely a BOSS in her own light 💯. I appreciate everyone at Bright now because they all played a amazing role in making my smile Bright. I Pray That God continues to bless Bright Now Dental in Hayward CA and provide all of they're neesds as a whole company Amen.

<Review>Dr. Sood is AMAZING and highly proficient at her job! I get fairly anxious in the patient chair, but I trust Dr. Sood with my dental health! The DA's and front office staff are lovely as well! Today, I was under the care of DA Halle! She's awesome and very efficient!

I have the best experience at this location! I'd recommend anyone reluctant to visit the dentist's office to pay this establishment a visit.

I walked in to Bright Smile clinic in Hayward and I was immediately entertained by their Clinic Manager to attend to my inquiries. She welcomed me walk me through the process of signing up on dental insurance, filing up the forms and even payment option on the dental work I needed. I got my dental insurance on the spot, got my appointment the next day, and my bills were taking cared of by my insurance and their affordable financing.

The Dental assistant, Dental Hygienist and my Dentist are all professional and courteous, very detailed on what I need to do to take care of my gums and teeth.

I am very satisfied and definitely a very happy patient of this clinic.

Keep up the good work and God bless you all!< /Text>

The staff is very friendly. The dentist and assistants have great bedside manner. (I think that’s what it’s called) they have good financial plans if you don’t have insurance. They let you know step by step exactly what you need. I had a great first experience here. I’ve been back for my second and it is a great place. I’ve only had one dentist in my 33 and just moved out here to the Bay Area. I tried western dental and did not like them. I found bright now and am very happy.</Text>

Theres plenty of people that would convince you so you’d end up spending more money, but she values your opinion rather than getting to stretch your bill. First time having my teeth cleaned here on 11/05/20 after work. Immediately welcomed with a smile and attended right away. I was helped by Maritza. She was really gentle and explained everything to me. I had plenty of questions too and she answered everything. After the appt, I had to pay for it but since I just came from work I forgot to bring my card with me lol, but the lady on the front desk was so nice and said I could pay next time! Who does this? I guess they really are more concerned about your dental health rather than your money! I would totally recommend this clinic to anyone!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1604766731473, 'text': 'Hello Rice On!

This office is horrible. I paid for teeth guard 2 years ago. Never received them and they keep charging me for the same procedure that happened 2 years ago. I keep paying them and the payment continues to pop up on my mail box. They are crooks. if I could give them zero stars I would.< /Text>

<review>I had a very poor experience. My appointment started late, the dentist who did my exam was visibly ill with a cold, and the cleaning was rough. Very rough. I was asked to move to a different room, and I assume it’s because there were too many patients. I asked the consultant (who explained my “treatment plan”), how long the rest of my appointment would be, and she said 20 minutes. Then the cleaning started.
The hygienist did my polish and floss without getting to all the surfaces of my teeth, and then the dentist did the scaling while constantly bumping the tools into my teeth and lips. My gums were bleeding excessively when I left (this does not usually happen). The end of my appointment was 45 minutes after I was told 20 minutes. I don’t mind a longer dentist appointment, but please give a reasonable time estimate.< /review>< rating>

I scheduled a Saturaday appointment 3 weeks in advance. On my appointment date, their door remained closed .  They did not call me to cancel my appointment. I and 4 other patients were waiting for an hour for the door to open.  The first appointment was 8am.  We all left at 9:40am and did not see any sign they would open. Their phone receptionists were not able tell us when or if the dentist would come.  Running business in this way is unacceptable.<//review>

Must avoid this place unless you want to waste your time and money  i went in for appointment which was for 9 am they made me wait until 10 n i ask whats going on the reception said we are trying to figure out your insurance which they should have done before i got to the appointment and than they said we only have one technician to do x ray we waiting on her n than once they did the xray they tell us that we have to pay additional money out of our pocket for a deep clean cuz our insurance doesnt cover for the entire service. They are just after your money they dont care about your well being.< /review>

Also, one of the girls in the front was very nice and helped me with all my questions, I forgot her name but she is the one from Oakland off Coolidge- thanks for your help! Also, (I didn’t get her name,) the lady in accounting or billing helped clear up some billing problems my stupid insurance had! Thank you so much for clearing that up for me.

My first appointments were at the Oakland office several years ago,
My first appointment in the Hayward office was three weeks ago and the difference was night & day.
In the Hayward office I was given an appointment  within days of my call and when I arrived for my appointment there was minimal paperwork.
When I was in the chair the Dentist asked me what I needed and I informed her what I expected to be done and to my amazement she let me know that I'm the patient and I'm in charge of what will done.
So far my experience has been great and differance after what my insurance pays and what is left for me to pay is very affordable.
I will be proud to recommend  Bright Now Dental to all of my friends in need of a good, affordable Dentist.
Thank You From.
A satisfied patient.

Highly recommended. Excellent service and great staff. Dr Cassidy did a great job extracting all my wisdom tooth. He was gentle and thorough with the procedure.</Review>

I get to visit Bright Now office in Hayward once a month with my youngest daughter for braces and twice a year with my 2 older daughters and myself for check ups and cleaning. We feel welcome every time. Everybody who works there have a beautiful smile to share.
They are so polite it makes me smile. I recomend Bright now to all my friends and family.</Text>

<text>The doctor is great but the staff is a hot mess. My mom had an appointment to get two teeth extracted. Her appointment was originally at 9am, she wasn’t seated til 9:33. Then, I heard the doctor ask one of the assistant what he was doing with the patient in the room( my mom) and the assistant said consultation.

Mind you we had been there two weeks prior for the consultation already. Doctor came in and was confused to seeing us again for a consultation.  So they basically sat my mom down in the wrong room and gave the doctor the wrong info🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️

Finally we were moved to the corrected room and the doctor saw my mom and he was so quick it was like 5 minutes tops which was wonderful.</text>< Time>

<Text>I’ve been receiving my periodontal care from this facility for many years now and never had a bad experience; however my recent visit was not so pleasant. My appointment was at 4pm and I didn’t get my name called till @4:45pm. My cleaning felt rushed and I had some concerns which were very short answered as if they were trying to hurry up and get me out of the chair. I was very unpleased this time around. I do understand that there was a reason for this delay but I feel it could of been dealt with differently.</Text>< Pictures>

The dentist was wonderful. Im pretty bummed that ill have to take my business elsewhere. I went in for my initial visit on Saturday, waited an hour, was seen for about 20 minutes, told that i would need to reschedule my cleaning and that i would receive a follow up call on Monday to schedule because they were backed up- i was very understanding. They printed out my Dental plan for treatment, quoted me 3349 out of pocket. I realized i had an additional insurance that wasn't being used, provided that information to the coordinator she advised i would get a call on Monday, Tuesday- no call, no follow up, called in to see what the hold up was- she said she would get back to me within 30 minutes. Of course i didn't get a follow up call. I called 5 times from my cell phone- i received the voice mail each time. I then decided to call from my desk phone- they answered immediately. She eventually told me what my cost would be with two insurances. My our of pocket went UP from 3349 to almost 5000. I am so disheartened by this service. I called my plan provider and they suggested for me to take my business elsewhere. If you are reading this review- you probably should too.< /Text>

The wait is HORRIBLE I had my appointment at 9 and they took me in at almost 10. Their excuse? They were looking for my “insurance” (which shouldnt they do before my arrival?) but then later told me that they were under staffed. I set my appointment so early so I could get to work on time but I still ending up coming in late. I don’t blame the workers I blame management for such poor quality on service.</Review>

<username>Bala Polanki</username><Review>Horrible Dental experience from Bright now dental Hayward.
On my first dental appointment I came to know treatment  would cost about $6000 without knowing the doctor name. First appointment was on 09/06/19 and last appointment for fillings completed on 11/07/2019. The front desk  treated me so bad that they will not give the appointment with out 2 weeks gap.Funny part of the appointments , they gave appointment by saying friday and i did not check the date. when i checked the date on following friday i was stunned. The Appointment was on friday with 30 days gap.If i call by saying i have pain they will treat only the teeth which has pain and will stop the treatment for that appointment.
On my second appointment doctor done the fillings by keeping the cloth to control tongue by not using the proper equipment and asking me to control the tongue while filling are done ,how is that possible doctor .Oh god , that was a horrible experience.  there is lot of sensitive issue  and she referred me to specialist.

Specialist Name TJ that's what i came to know by sub ordinates , He did not tell his name and he was shouting horribly while checking the teeth.
it could 2 minutes to complete the appointment. He said HE WILL NOT CHECK THE OTHER TEETH BECAUSE DOCTOR ASKED HIM TO CHECK ONLY ISSUE TEETH.My Bad horrible experience with the specialist too.

For the remaining fillings , when i check with doctor she asked me why I did not check the remaining teeth with the specialist.

Finally on 11/07/2019, She done my remaining fillings i was lucky i came to know the doctor name Sarika Sood.

This treatment has offended me so horribly , I would love to go legally against them if it is possible< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

I want to thank Bright Now Dental on Hesperian blvd in Hayward. I received excellent service, from making an appointment to getting the work done to give me my smile. When they say what can they do to make you smile, they mean it and do what it takes to do it. The front desk was warm and friendly, the dental team was gentle and very experienced. I want to say Thank You for everything.

< Review>
They were missing a piece of equipment on the laughing gas machine and they used masking tape to fix it.
After filling out the insurance forms for the new patient, I was asked again several times if I had insurance or not. The office manager ended up charging only one of my insurance, instead of using both to cut the cost. How lazy! My mother had to call back and reverse the credit card transaction, and give them proper instructions.
I asked them to change my misspelled name in the system, and lo and behold the text I recieve from them even for this review has my name spelled wrong! You don't really care about your patients, do you...
The only good thing about this experience was the surgeon.< /Review>

My experience at this office was nothing short of fantastic. I was greeted and checked in quickly thanks to Gabriela, the receptionist. most importantly, the whole process went very smoothly and quick which is exactly what I was looking for in a dental office.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Dr. Lavorini was the nicest oral surgeon I've ever met, he went out his way to make me feel comfortable and even before the procedure, he assured me that everything would go just fine and what his main concern was, which was for me to have the best treatment. He succeeded. The general manager, was very pleasant. I had my schedule mixed up and the first time I went into the office, she let me know my appointment wasn't until a week later, I was furious because I was in a lot of pain, and I reacted in a not so good way, but when I went into the office early yesterday morning, she did not hold that against me and she also remembered me! Every member of staff that I met yesterday, was really nice, and welcoming, and smiling. I would recommend this dentist and come back to visit with no hesitation.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Dr. Sood has been my dentist for many years and she and her team are always helpful, knowledgeable and compassionate to me, as I have a lot of trepidation around a dental office. They complete whatever treatments quickly and always ensure I’m comfortable before proceeding.  They give thorough descriptions of what procedures I may have, clear after care instructions and they follow up with me afterwards to. They are also always friendly and it makes for a great atmosphere.< /Review>

One of the best dentist I been to. The staff here are so nice and professional. The place is also so clean and bright.

The office manager Jessica, is so wonderful. She does a great job keeping the office organized and patients happy. It's just too bad Nicole, (receptionist ) no longer work here because she was also so sweet and welcoming. My daughter just loves her. Good Customer service is always a big thing to me.

As for the doctors, they are great. They really take good care of you.  They make you feel so comfortable. My son gets his  braces here while I see a doctor for my crown. My husband and I will soon be getting our wisdom teeth out, but I wouldn't ask for a better place. I also had a hygenist who did my deep cleaning and she was so gental. Can't be more happier.<//Review>

this is by far the best bright now I've been too. I used to go to one down south but since I've moved I've been visiting the Hayward location. The office manager Jessica is so kind and patient and willing to accommodate my busy schedule . The front staff is always smiling and happy to see me. I can tell Dr.Sood cares about her patients , she followed up with me after I had a couple teeth pulled to see how I was feeling ! I will recommend  to all my friends.</text>

<Review>I had a very bad experience with them. They were just trying to keep me there while making me pay for unexpected things each time I go. They made me pay about $4,000 out of pocket for a crowne even though I had my insurance. They charged me $290 for the maintenance each time I go. They mostly care about money not your health.</Review>< Rating>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>The staff at Bright Now Dental are not only professional and courteous but they are considerate and ensure you're aware of the reasons behind the services they recommend prior to providing. They have real concerns for my health and well-being and suggest preventative procedures or practices for a happy mouth. I just recently decided to get a night guard because my grinding at night is negatively affecting my molars. Marissa, the Hygienist, had suggested to me several visits ago but it wasn't until today that it really occurred to me how important it is. Jessica, the office manager, kindly informed me of the charges and had Jen quickly fit me for a night guard. Bright Now Dental is super conveniently located near my home and work and I'm grateful to have a team of people that care about me in more ways than one.

Poor management. My and wife had an appointment specifically for cleaning first time patient, they  charged for X-Ray and claim that didnt have a hiegienst due to sickness??????? Their fast money making tactics is to charge you for an X-Rays and  send you home.  This tactics is very common in the dentistry industry.< /Review>

I went there didn't knowing exactly what to expect. I was eating dinner the night before and something cracked. Gave them the description of the situation that brought me there and then after fulfilling the forms, I was introduced to this incredible sweet woman who made sure all the x-rays came out properly. She guide me through the process while explaining with such amazing care and kindness what was going on and why it was important. Then it was time to meet the doctor for diagnostics. She was the kind of person you feel right at home from the moment she introduces herself. Her smile pushed away the nerves built up before with the idea of lossing some of teeth. She sensed right away my nerves and with patience and kindness ran the examination. Tomorrow I will visit them again and let me tell that I'm really excited to get back to complete the treatment because this people are just soooo sweet and incredible that I may not want to leave again!</text>

Terrible experience . I’d give negative stars if possible .

I went there specifically for a tooth extraction since my dentist didn’t perform this type of work.  I had a consultation which I had to wait a 1/2 hr for so that should have been my first warning sign.  I then called and made my appointment for 9:30am. I asked the rep if there would be await because I didn’t want to have to wait all day and she assured me that the surgery times stay current and there would be no delays. I received a confirmation text right after stating the same time. A day before the surgery I get a call from the office to confirm my appointment time and I’m told it’s 10am. Not sure how that happened but oh well. I show up the next day at 9:45am. At 10:30 after waiting for 45 mins I ask the front desk why I haven’t been called back.  The front desk then tells me that they are cleaning my room and I’ll be called back in a few minutes. The few minutes turned into another 30 mins. At 11am they call me bs j and place me in a room . I was left there for another 20 mins with no interactions or updates . By then my anxiety of having to wait now for 1 hr and 40 mins had kicked in and I was no longer comfortable with having them do any work on me.  They had not lived up to my appointment time and would they told me over the phone. I walked up front yo the front desk and met the rep know that I’ve been sitting and waiting and I can’t wait any longer and was leaving. No services were tendered to me. My time is very valuable and this office had no consideration for that . The service is garbage , no updates and unprofessional . I will never go back and would let anyone who ask me know I not go there.<//Review>

The dentist, Dr. Sood, is extremely gentle, caring and accommodating.  I once broke my front tooth at 2:00 am.  I called the answering service crying about my tooth and asked to tell them that I needed an urgent appointment.  I had a presentation the next afternoon and needed something to replace the tooth.  Believe it or not, Dr. Sood called me at 2:45am to assure me she would help me.  When I came in that morning, Dr. Sood created a temp crown that looked great.  I gave her a big hug for helping me out in my time of need.  THEY'RE A GREAT DENTAL OFFICE!!! Did I mention painless....</review></record></dataset><record>

I loved that she explained and answered my questions in regards to my teeth.   The hygienist that worked with my teeth can't recall her name but very sweet and gental  with her hands.   Defiantly found my new Dentist office!</review>< pictures>

< review>
I visited the Hayward Office of Brigh Now and let me tell you EVERYONE there have been AMAZING 😉 towards me.... i called them for an EMERGENCY APPOINTMENT around 3PM and they told me to come into their Office that day! I couldn’t believe it! I have been going through sooo much with my teeth and some of the things I’ve been going through have been embarrassing to say the least!!! The doctor over there listened to my concerns and that day she had a lot of patient’s to see!!!!! She was great she has made me feel okay with my situation  and has started the process of putting together a plan to help me with my teeth for the near future...Jessica, who is the Office Manager was AWESOME as well... THE WHOLE STAFF MAKEA YOU FEEL AT HOME ANS DOEA NOT JUDGE YOU!!! THEY ARE THERE TO HELP MAKE YOUR SMILE 😊 THE BEST IT CAN BE AND I AM SOOOO APPRECIATIVE OF THEM!! THANK YOU BRIGHT NOW (HAYWARD) STAFF!!!!!< /review>

I've always hated going to the dentist but not anymore.  The office staff are all friendly and efficient and Merizza, the hygienist is very gentle.  Dr. Sood puts you totally at ease with her soft voice and caring manor.  Everything is explained to me in detail about what they are doing, or need to do, and how much it will cost.  There are no surprises.  They even offer to help you with getting an interest free loan if you need one.<//Text>

<name>J R< /name><GmapID>0x808f9105834e8331:0xdbcd516e2af46f05<//GmapID><review>By far my favorite dental place I have ever been too. I had originally been a patient in the Fresno,Ca one. The one in Fresno was equally as amazing. I moved and was really sad to leave my dentist. When I found one out here in the Bay Area I was estatic. I was nervous if it would be the same experience. After my first visit. I was driving from Half Moon Bay to Hayward just for them! Then I moved closer and started making my husband go here as well. The staff is fantastic, the places is always clean, people are smiling, and they always find a way to work with you. Granted I've always loved the dentist lol. Who doesn't love that clean feeling. I'm even more thankful though for a great dental office. Off I go for some fillings! Yay me! I literally fall asleep half the time when they are cleaning my teeth. I feel bad cause they ask me if I'm ok and I'm half way to la la land lol.

Update 2019: While I do still love how close they are an the ease of working with them on my teeth. I felt like they didn’t take much thought when it came to referring me to a specialist. I came in complaining of some discomfort with a tooth. The Dentist examined it an said she wanted a second opinion. They referred me out to some place in Oakland. I called that place an they wanted almost $200 to exam a tooth. I know if you have normal insurance this may be free or not an issue. My insurance allows me a certain amount each year an then reimburses me. I called a local place about 10 minutes from Bright Now. They got me in and my exam was free. They said I would only pay if I needed work done. They were also confused why Bright now didn’t just refer patients to them. Not sure if Bright Now has some contract with the Oakland place. But I’m going to be weary of information they give me an just do my own research. So -1 Star<//review>< time>

<text>I would've given  this place a 4 stars since staff there are nice but after a while, im starting to hate this place. I recommended this place to my sister and set a consultation appointment for her to get her braces done. The manager set up the appointment and told me that my sister can just come in. My sister arrived and the lady told her she didn't have appointment and can't verify her insurance. because of that, my sister had to waste her time because of some irresponsible people. I also noticed that some receptionist there don't give alot of availabilities when making your next appointments. They would give you only the time that they think is better and not the time that you actually prefer. also, when I set up an appointment over the phone for teeth extraction and wanted to apply for financing, the lady on the phone didn't tell me that they would need a voided check. so when I arrived on the day of my appointment, i had to come back because i didnt bring mu voided check. If they would've told me before, i would've brought it.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>2</rate>< Gmap_id>

Hi everyone ! I had three teeth pulled here and it was a painless experience . The staff of ladies are so nice and helpful . They explain what the dentist and orthodontist recommend for you . They give you an estimate of cost of treatment . I also got adult braces here . I'm 25 . I love them ! I always get white elastics . The orthodontist is very professional . Give them a call and schedule a consultation . Put your smile in good hands like I did .< /Review>

<Review>Auto insurance quote is NOT competitive AND about 2-times higher than Liberty Mutual.   Free gift promotions by mail is only honored once after auto insurance quote, even after subsequent free promotions by mail and you check their auto insurance rates again.  When you request to have your name and address removed from their mailing list, it's temporary and you start receiving their marketing letters again.  Use to get additional discount from AAA Auto Insurance at time of premium renewal, due to the profits shared when they invest your premiums in the stock market.  That's out-the-door also.  Always check with other insurance carriers annually.  A lot of other cost effective, efficient, courteous and better service companies.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place looks nice and new. I didn’t stay inside much due to current world circumstances going on so I don’t know how to rate comfortability of the place. Out of all DMV experiences, my last visit to the AAA Alameda Branch on  26 March 2021 has been my worst visit ever. I think that I would have rather gone to the DMV as they could have processed the same information in probably the same amount of time as it took here.

The first thing that went wrong during my experience was when I was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which ended up being closer to 50. I checked in and never received a call or text letting me know that my spot was ready. Instead, when I went into the branch at the 50 minute mark, I was told that I could wait in line to see the next available person.

I don’t know what went wrong with all of my DMV transactions but it was worse than pulling teeth. First, the car that I just purchased, the AAA representative started arguing to me regarding the price I could pay for a vehicle. Second, when I notified her of all the transactions that I needed to perform that day, she would respond with an answer that answered only half of my question so when I tried to process the other half, I was told that she wasn’t able to do it. She then said that she was able to do it. She told me she couldn’t look information up in the system and then told me information that I needed to know regarding the vehicle that I was trying to look up.

I will steer clear of this AAA location in the future and would rather drive farther to get better customer service in the future. If this was my first time at a AAA branch, I would of cancelled my membership due to lack of customer service from the front end person and the argumentative behavior from the service member that I dealt with.<//Review><UserId.>112268710457162268016<//UserId.>< gmapID>

I went to provide my transfer of Title this morning. around 9:25am.

The lady behind the counter was rude as hell saying "I didn't follow directions" just because I provided my AAA card not my Driver's License. I l provided both but she said "I didn't follow directions" in a condescending way.

Her tone was rude as hell</review>

<review>Completely horrible customer service!
The receptionist (heavy set woman with braids) had a problem with me listening to my phone, meanwhile the music playing  from is loud a little loud.
I was the only customer in the building yet Im left waiting for 29 minutes. What the hell are the agents doing!?!? (Their actions at this branch is the perfect way to lose business!!)< /review>< UserId.>

Agent was in too big a hurry to be done with me. I had asked for a map with routing from the Bay Area to Boise Idaho and a Boise map.  Only an Idaho map and she was done with me.

How do I get a map with routing to Boise? And where do I get a Boise map?<//Review>

I have been a member of AAA for almost 3 years and 99.9% of the time, the experience have been pleasant, HOWEVER the reason I am giving my experience today a 1 star is b/c of the poor, discourteous service by the 'check-in' person I received on 1/26/2021 ~ 5PM. The reason for my visit was to update my address for my Vehicle registration card. When asked to clarify on the COA process,  the response I received wasn’t clear by this agent and then I asked again and she repeated it in a very rude and unprofessional manner. At this point, I was frustrated with my entire visit (drove about 45 mins to get task done). It was a heavyset female who was in charge of checking in and filter the customers and suffice to say, AAA needs to do better on training and professionalism. I am not suggesting you guys fire her but please do a better job on how these CX agents are actually providing CX service. The gentlemen who actually helped me with the task itself was very helpful and cordial.</text>

< review>
It is really rare for me to give a bad review, but my experience at AAA in Alameda near In N Out was not only costly, but also was in poor taste.

I visited to request title duplicates for vehicles I meant to eventually sell. I opened the door to be greeted by someone at the front whose face looked very puzzled kind of like "what are you doing here" asking, "do you need something?". Maybe she was just intrigued about an unfamiliar customer, but no smiles.

I mean that's not too big a deal, but it really set the tone for what was to come.

I let her know I would like to request duplicate titles for 4 vehicles and she gave me 4 dmv pink forms. I didn't receive any guidance on filling them out, but that's okay.

I filled out the forms for 4 vehicles to request dupes for which took a while. I then entered and was asked to sit and wait.

My turn came to see a representative to turn in the forms and I stepped up to speak with her. She looked at the forms and she scanned them with her eyes. She then looked at me and asked, "are you just trying to sell these vehicles?". I said "yes, and I would like to have the titles handy so that I can have smooth time selling them." She said, "it takes up to 30 days to receive a title in the mail. It is faster to just bring the the customer to sign the forms". I then insisted, "i want to offer confidence the next buyer because the last customer bailed because we didn't have the title handy. I want to avoid that from happening again". Exasperatedly the rep said, "if you want to sell it sooner, you're better off just bringing the customer into the dmv or aaa and transferring the title on the same form." It's true. There is a way for titles to transfer this way, but the caveat is for only those wish to register the vehicle in California. My dad who was with me was also convinced by this notion and voted that we skip out on trying to get the duplicates. I had already filled out four of these forms and waited, but I conceded based on the expert advice. I didn't anticipate this caveat that I mentioned, registration limited to CA without the title, and low and behold, 1 month later, my next interested party is from Mexico. I replicate the process advised by the AAA rep expert who informed me and was knocked by the fact that the customers didn't need to register the vehicles in CA.

The fact that I insisted in my interest for titles, but was talked out of it and not really met with any useful help, just makes me kick myself for trusting them there. I think the reason behind why she suggested me to come back with the customer  was because they were open for limited hours and I might have filled it out improperly and just didn't want to bother with me.

This review might come as a surprise to some or just be met with criticism for my naivete or sore loss, but is it too much to expect from a paid membership to be met with expertise and care for the customer?

I don't know what it is, but I feel belittled by this office and somewhat cheated. Luckily the customer is flexible and is ready to buy still, but this experience with AAA was an unexpected cost of money and time.

Hate all you want on this, but this is what you get from me. I only wish there was a Yelp page to add another bad review. I feel like they misinformed me and disuaded me from improving my legal standing on my property. Why did i listen? My suggestion is don't listen to these reps and they don't know anything. From the greeter to the assistant. That's it.< /review>

And helped with my temporary disabled placard too.  Also helped change a tire on my truck in the driveway (after I found the special jack).< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This branch is awesome; even during COVID, they were still helping members. Had to renew my vehicle registration and get my temporary disabled placard. Although my registration was due at the end of May, the DMV understood that the time necessitated change to help out the citizens and was given a 60 day extension and luckily I was within that time frame and was able to get my '21 tags and renew my temporary disabled placard until Jan '21 also. Thank you AAA Alameda!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594054927567, 'text': "Thanks for the feedback.

The representative that helped me I clearly asked her how much was the roadside assistance for the the lease amount and I asked her $42 she says yes she runs my card and ends up being 56 there's a miscommunication on her part completely I don't feel she's been trained properly and as I was leaving I asked her one last question and she raised her voice at me< /Review>

Nice branch, very slick. Usually very good  friendly service, especially for DMV.  Had a problem last time that they wouldn’t let me renew my registration on my family car bc the registration has my company name on it (I’m a solopreneur but evidently my 1-woman company is not a AAA member) so after waiting in line I had to go back to the DMV and wait again... I wouldn’t have minded if the desk agent had been more polite and not just handed back the check like it was too much trouble...< /text>

Soo glad CSAA opened a branch Alameda!  It's super clean, convenient with parking, small crowds, and the absolutely the best service from their insurance folks to the hardworking DMV reps. Thanks for being part of the community.</text>

Super clean, people are all really friendly.
They do some services, so you might be able to avoid going to the DMV which is basically a fate worse than death and they botch your paperwork anyways, so just come here and have it done right the first time instead of paying twice to have your life complicated by jerks that can't do their job.
Love it.</review>

The rep I dealt with was completely incompetent.  He failed to properly renew my membership so that my wife was included.  I only find this out when she was stuck in the dark on the side of the highway.  Avoid this particular AAA location.</Review>

<review>I had a complicated situation with a classic sports car that included out of state title, hard to find Vin numbers etc.. DMV would have send me to the back of the line for hours but thanks to a gentleman by the name of Ken I had everything sorted out in 15 minutes. The woman that initially tried to help me out kept complaining that it was almost her lunch time so I said "go to lunch please". It was clear she had no idea what she was doing and couldn't care less. Ken said "yeah go to lunch" and finished the paperwork no problem. That's worth five stars.

<text>I would have given them a five star rating a week ago but after dealing with claims specialist Shonda foster.... I would give less than 1 star if I could. I’m a paying customer and have been given ultimatums and deadlines and am being bullied into taking a settlement offer that doesn’t reflect the cost of replacing my vehicle even though I am insured through AAA. I’m a paying customer. I asked to be switched to another rep who doesn’t deliver ultimatums to complete the process before the agent leaves on vacation and was assured I would NOT be getting another person to assist me.
Just another insurance company scamming it’s customers.

Edited to add that the people who I have dealt with in the office have always been amazing. It’s a shame the people administering the products they sell are not like them... at all.< /text>< pictures>

Okay. Confusing. This office does not have it together about addressing you when you first come in the door. There is no obvious go to waiting line if there is one. One guy at a front podium (start line?) does not acknowledge you while talking to another to have you wait. Then waited in a seating area right there while he saw 2 other people after I came in. Apparently I am invisible. 1st day of it's opening around 4 pm. I only wanted a new DMV booklet, or ask about when it's available. No help. I walked out.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>All the reviews prior to January 30th are fake. I just stopped by the branch to use the DMV service and there's a big banner that reads "opening January 30". I talked to a friendly guy who works there and he said they would be open on Monday (today is Jan 27) and he'd be happy to help me then.

It forced me to put SOMETHING for a star rating, can't honestly give it a 5 since I technically haven't dealt with them yet. I'll rewrite this after I work with them.

In short, and review posted prior to Jan 30th, 2017 is fake. Funny how they are like a month old. Fake people suck, makes it difficult to trust reviews. 😒

*******UPDATE********
I went back now that they're open, and these people are definitely worth visiting. Everyone is super friendly and helpful.
5 Star service!!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>This is a great a convenient place to store your stuff. The place is very clean and well-maintained. And the lady Robin that is running the place I don't think you could find a nicer sweeter person if you went out looking. Overall I would recommend this place to my friends and family to store their stuff. If you're looking for a place to store your stuff give Robin a call I'm sure she can help you out and do it with a smile on her face. Very sweet lady. I am a satisfied customer.<//Text><Date>1601714280234< /Date>< Response>

Always clean and they make you feel secure having your items stored here. There are 16 cameras monitoring at all times. The people who work here drive around on the little carts checking to make sure everything is picked up and safe when the office is open. Very friendly staff.<//review>

Prices are great locations great,  but the manager comes off very rude and will stop renting to you for any little mistake.  I was very calm and respectful and apologetic during the time mrs robin was yelling at me infront of other renter's  as if i was a child because i left 1 of my belongings  infront of key  pad  no longer then 40 second's to run back to back and give my father his key and because my dad steppd in.and said you dont have to apologize to her.   Over all the business is good but i think its time for a new manager a younger one perhaps that isnt so mean.< /review>

It is an actual small market too. They have absolutely everything a gas station store would, but they even have a really big wine, liquor, drinks, snacks, coffee and even smoke selection. I've never seen another Shell like this one. Also, it's big, nice, super clean and OPEN 24 HOURS! The guys are always pretty cool too.<//Text>< time>

Beware. They are price gouging during the state of emergency.  $4.99 for a gallon of water and will respond with they can do what they want and don't like it, don't buy it. If you explain there's a law during state of emergencies, they then change the story to they're paying more now so it's ok.<//review>

<Review>Traveling through - stopped for diesel. C-store was well stocked.  The soda fountain Coke tasted great. Ladies bathroom was sorely in need of cleaning -Not up to the Shell standards that I have come to expect. The man running the cash register was apparently not having a good day - not the best customer service.< /Review><user_name>Morna Stout<//user_name><resp>None<//resp><Date>1543299828284</Date></record></dataset><record>

This place just opened so far so good, has a nice selection of alcohol to choose from (beer, wine, spirits). Gas is not too expensive here. Personally would've liked if the air was free like in other gas stations, had to try to find $1.50 in quarters only when I needed to refill a flat but other than that decent place</Text>

Very dissatisfied in how they are handling this pandemic they do not practice social distance...I was in the store and a customer was hacking and sneezing with no mask I always came here but because there is no regard for life and you should require your customers wear them this thing is not over yet untill you get it...make you store safe for you customers not just YOU!!!<//Review>

Went to buy a pack of cigarettes, a soda, chips and a ice cream they tried to charge my husband 37 for something that would cost less than 20. When we brought it to their attention they got mad and rang it up again and said 35 we disputed it again then he rand it up and it was 18 which made me sense. They will RIP you off and its not the first time this happened to us. Be careful</text>

<Review>Ok,  we ordered two dark roast coffees.  They were served luke warm.  Asked for a new hot coffee and server said,  “well, you will have to wait while we make a new pot”.  That is their only job....make and serve hot coffee and be nice to the people that pay their salary.  Not serve cold coffee and be rude because the four people working there could not be prepared with hot coffee.  Not one thank you from any staff.  I ate the sandwich,  drank my coffee ,  and went back in for a glass of water and the guy looked at me like, “go away”.  Again,  not one thank you.  Just go away looks.  That is why this company is turning into a place that we only go to when traveling and no where else is available.  The barista handed me my water without even looking at me.  All of the four robots were very rude.   Get it together Starbucks.  I manage customer service in a busy company and can tell you that customer service is pretty much non existent at this location .  They all get a score of zero.zero.   Have a wonderful day.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Over-roasted coffee which only brews their cheapest grind. You don't come here for brewed coffee, so you gotta order the more expensive espresso drinks. But then those aren't very good either. Why they don't brew decaf coffee (you can only get decaf Americano) in the afternoon is beyond me. If you just want a coffee in the pm but don't want to stay up half the night, you can't get it at Starbucks. A Specialty coffee place should have better standards.</Review>< user_id>

<Text>Love the coffee, not this location so much...dirty tables inside and out, staff running late to get in and prepared. This location has a fireplace and @ 38 degrees this morning would have been nice but like I said , staff probably is so unaware of finer details that conveniences noted are ignored or simply overlooked. Patrons don't really have a choice in this location, not much to choose from which may also be the reason this Starbucks doesn't care to be better.<//Text>< Pics>

Four people behind counter, one making drinks, one taking orders, one changing trash bags, one looking at a book.  Line had 7 people waiting to order.  Staff was unfriendly acting like they did not want to be there.  Yes, I get it on a Sunday morning but a simple smile would have been nice.<//Review>

< review>
I deleted my 5 star rating to give a 1 star because of being refused service.
The past 2 years, every single morning, I come here to indulge in my venti blonde roast coffee appetite, order a breakfast sandwich if I like, and take advantage of the free wi-fi.
Now, with no warning or heads up, I am refused a fifty cents refill because of the barista who served me was no longer at the cash register. This is not the way you do business or treat customers, a regular customer, at that. My feelings are hurt.
This is an establishment I have become loyal to. I do not go to any other coffee shop, until now. I am taking my $350 Starbucks monthly budget somewhere else where I will not be offended.
This experience is not going to stop at this Google review.  I am taking this further to corporate office, yelp, yahoo, etc...

I, now, understand why Starbucks is closing 500 stores nationwide because of business lose.</review>

First time eating at this restaurant.  Loved it.  Very clean, very friendly and food was reasonably priced.  The food was delicious. Come from out of town, will definitely be eating here again< /review>

Tried to give me the wrong drink 3 times then when I finally was handed the correct milkshake, it was more milk than shake. Handed it back and left without it and without a refund. Won’t be returning. Rude employees as well. The Assistant manager was of no help.</Review>

During this pandemic we have only tried outside food while we are out and that's Burger King. I have been a fan of their junior whopper from Toronto, Canada to California,USA.<//Review>

Usually when i get fast food, im nice to the staff (because they’re the ones making the food after all), but their quality service is off the charts. Super friendly, loving people, and are willing to take any challenge that manifests their way. Man, this place is life</Review>< Pictures>

I came around 9pm to this BK and I had a big order when I got to the window to pay I got my order and I was handed my bags by this girl and never said a word to me except for, do you want some sauce, after she handed me my food she never said thank you or anything and I thought I still had more bags coming as I had a big order. I waited and stayed on drive through until she looked out the window and I said is this all my food and she notted her head to say yes and I said well I thought I had more food because you didn't say thank you I thought I had more bags and she replied with a humbling saying "ahu" and I said are you kidding me what do you mean "ahu" and she said OK and closed the window slowly. And to top it off the person on drive through sounded irritated because I kept ordering more than one meal. What kind of managers are managing these rude kids these days. I had to drive to prundale because the BK closest to me was under remodeling. The only good part they did this time is that they didn't mess up my order.</review>< Rate>

Really undertrained staff, from not knowing how to handle a mistake expiditing food, almost every other car is parked, & employees eating in the kitchen. The manager was like "yo I'll be you in a minute". This used to be a great burger king.< /review>

We drove through prunedale after hours of driving coming home and my kids were hungry thinking we should just stop by burgerking and grab a bite to eat. It was 11 and I know they close at 12 but as in pull up there was no one around tending the front of the resturant. When after 10 mins a young black hair short gentle came out very aggressive and as I asked if there still open he stares and try to act as if I'm trespassing through his propperty. Then he does the chop hand signal through the neck to say as if there close when it's only 11 an hour earlier then usual. My kids were complaining thinking they were going to have something to eat so I insisted and ask why and the man puff out his chest and served at me. So I told the kids let's just leave while backing up the other workers came out and started to laugh just standing there. I don't know who or why the management hires these kinds of thugs but for paying customers like my family and i who use to like coming to this burger King location but sense that experience I'd rather go eat elsewhere. As for the gangster who worked on 7-19-15 at night shame on you displaying those actions in front of my kids now they ask why people act like that when all you ask if there open when they should be.</Review>

Consistent quality, bold flavors, decent price for the ingredients. Tostadas are always a favorite.  Just as good as when it was a pop up.<//Review>

One of the best vegan tacos I ever had! Either you eat meat or not, you would love it! This is not a restaurant but rather an expensive kind of joint but I still definitely recommend this place. Here is the picture: sorry, it was so good, you will not see the full tostada! Had to stop myself to share a picture!< /text>

I often find that restaurants' vegetarian options are not as good as meat options, but I am blown away by the thought and care they have put into their cauliflower and squash tacos. They are out of this world and I've been dreaming of the cauliflower ever since!</Text>

I will do whatever I can to support local small businesses in this  economy that the coronavirus has ruined. But above and beyond all that, Tacos Oscar makes wonderful food, comfort food. We all need comfort now.< /text>

This is a spot that never disappoints, the flavors combined with the texture and ingenuity of each taco variety is out of this world. I have trouble not ordering 1 of every flavor every time I go here. And the Monday crunch wrap? Incredible!< /review>

This was such a great dinning experience with good food. They have such a creative menu I got egg, cauliflower, and pork tacos (each seperate), they change the menu every once in a while so you can always go and be surprised.  The atmosphere is casual outside dinning and all the staff are very friendly, they have many dietary friendly options on the menu.</review>

I walked up to the window and asked for 1 each of the cashier's 3 favorite tacos. I was blown away. Fresh made tortillas and amazing meat selections (the vegan options looked SUPER good as well). All-in-all best tacos I've had in a long time.</review></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely stunning. There is nothing like Oscars in the continental 48. Everything on the menu is special and surprising. We are lucky to have the hidden gem that is Oscar's in the Bay's backyard. Literally the best in the land.</review>< pics>

This place is amazing! The front of it is a refurbished storage container where they prepare all the food and take orders. Go behind for some outdoor seating. Fun music tasty beers, and tacos are out of this world good. The prices are incredibly reasonable and the staff is kind. I will definitely be back!</Text>

Wow wow wow. Amazing and creative tacos in a cool hidden outdoor space. The egg and cauliflower tacos were my favorite; the seitan (“asada”) and beef were great too, though the seitan had a surprisingly strong kick. The outdoor space has heat lamps but bring warm layers anyway. Will definitely be back.<//Text>

BEST TACOS EVER!!  I've been a "stalker" for a few years now, going to every pop-up I could and devouring 3-4 tacos.  Now I can eat them every week.  :)

Best Vegan tacos I've ever had.  I've taken carnivores and inevitably the Vegan one's turn out to be their favorite.  But seriously, everything is delicious.  From the fresh hand pressed tortillas to the sauces, to different options every week.  It's so d@%mn good!</review>

<Text>The tacos are to die for. However, my low rating is because I placed an $80 take out and when I got my credit card bill, I learned they added an 18% tip without my knowledge. I've heard of automatic tips for large parties but never for take out. I've tried to call and get it corrected but Tacos Oscar never answers their phone!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1559282435000, 'text': "Hi Laura, I'm sorry this happened. When you pay, you are left with the option to tip 0%, 15%, 18%, 25% etc... For some reason our POS System has the tip set at 18% with the option for customers to adjust. Please email us at tacososcar@gmail.com and we can reimburse you whatever you'd like. Again, sorry, in the future, the tip window always  pops up. We never add tips to anything, it is up to the customer to adjust the tip before the signature screen appears. I'm assuming you paid in person.

This is not your average taqueria.   The handmade tortillas are freakin' fantastic, the ingredients are seasonal, creative and high quality.  Great chilled out back yard for your casual dining moments without pretention and without big prices.   This is an excellent addition to the neighborhood.</Text>

<Text>Awesome spot, a cut above your average taco. Ordered the menu, it might rotate. I had three tacos, chile verde pork, chorizo, egg and potato, and mushroom plus the squash quesadilla. The pork was juicy with a mellow sweetness, and the egg/chorizo was dope! The mushroom also had an amazing flavor with a bit of spice, and the quesadilla, forget about it! That cheese is sooo good! A bit messy but delicious. Food came quick, patio has heating. Everything was awesome! Can't wait to go back! Chips!!</Text>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Dr Nasser Antonius is a compassionate & wise healer who provides  exceptional care.
I called late on Friday afternoon with a dental emergency & was accommodated immediately by
his assistant, Jessica, who went out of her way to make me feel at ease & fully supported.
Dr. Nassar thoroughly explained my options, & offered superior expertise in solving a difficult problem.
I offer my sincere gratitude to Dr. Antonius & his knowledgeable staff, & highly recommend his
services to all.<//review>< pics>

<review>Sunnyvale Dental Care is an amazing dental treatment provider. Jessica at the front desk is extremely caring and has the best interests of the patient in mind. She ensured a quick treatment timeline based on my specific needs as I was transitioning between two jobs. Dr. Antonius is a great dentist with a good sense of humor and I loved him too.
Overall, I highly recommend the place.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I lived 50minutes away from here and i still come to this dental because this is the best i can find near my place. Please at least consult with them. you wont regret!</Text></record></dataset><record>
<review>Very professional and experienced. Dr. Antonius and his assistant were so calm and confident while extracting my impacted wisdom tooth. He knows what he’s doing and explained everything step by step, before, during and after the procedure. Jessica was very accommodating and makes sure to find schedule that is convenient for me. Met Julia once and shes very cheerful and gives good advice - like a mother would. I give 10 stars.⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I never thought I would say that I had a wonderful visit at a dentist office. Once you walk into the office you get a feeling of calmness. The lady at the front desk her name is Jessica and she is the sweetest thing ever and good at her job.The x-ray technician Julia was the first person I ever had to take my x-rays and not cut my gums. And the dentist by far did an amazing job. Thank you so much DDS Nasser Antonious.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

His assistants are very kind . Dentist gets mad if you don’t understand what he says and reminds you that he has a ton of patients waiting and he has no time ...
So if you are not-fluent English speaker ,,,think twice !!</Text>< Pictures>

Really I recommend doctor Antonious. Before I came here I was suffering from my molars. I can’t sleep at night. I call the staff here and they help me to have quick appointment with doctor. In one or two weeks he resolved all my pain. He is very professional and nice.<//Text>

This is my first time visiting a Dental Clinic in the U.S., so I was a little nervous. But the front desk staff Julia and Jessica greeted me in a well-organized manner so I was somehow relieved. Dr. Antonious is very professional and experienced with more than 30 years' practice. They also explain procedures and expenses clearly and know big tech firms' insurance policies pretty well. Special thanks to lovely Dr. Antonious's help with my tooth cavities!</review>

<Text>Extremely helpful. They go out of their way to make sure you are helped in best way possible. Affordable too. We needed an emergency root canal and they made sure they had some time for us. I called so many other dentists who disappointed us. Sooo glad I found Sunnyvale dental care.
I would come here again. Highly recommended!!!</Text>< username>

Would definitely recommend Sunnyvale dental care! Couple of things that stood out for me:
- very professional and courteous front office staff. Julia was amazing ... she understood my concern and helped fit an appointment on priority instead of just saying “appointment not available “!!!!
- Dr. Antonio’s is very experienced and knowledgeable. He is direct and says as it is with no nonsense attitude! The way he handled my case shows he loves his work and is focused on giving the best treatment:) this definitely helped build trust and authenticity!

Thank you Sunnyvale Dental Care!</Review>

I needed emergency dental work done and my dentist office wasn't open. Sunnyvale Dental Care has a 24/7 number I was able to call to leave a message with and once the office was open, someone called who knew what the situation was and booked me an appointment the same day. The availability and speedy response made all the difference in reducing my unbearable pain! The office is clean, following all the COVID protocols, and the staff is kind.<//text>

My husband and I chose this dentistry two years ago and were not mistaken.  We have successfully treated several teeth.  The work was done super professionally! The doctor is very kind and explains to you that he is going to do. Administrator Julia is also very nice and patient.

Dr Antonious and Carla were wonderful!

Sunnyvale Dental has a great dentist and staff. The Dr. fixed a tooth that other offices could not. He explained everything with all the details I requested. In his work, he found two unexpected problems and fixed them on the spot. THE MOST IMPRESSIVE POINT:  The dentist personally called me on a Saturday to ask me if all was good and asked if I had any problems!  If you want it done right, go see them!</review>

He is always on time and efficient. The staff are all super friendly - particularly Julia who is very organized and kind. The office as a whole is very clean and welcoming. I can't give a stronger recommendation.< /text>< gmapID>

Dr. A and his staff are the best in the business. I've gone to many dentists, and only Dr. A has been able make my teeth healthy. He is up to date on all of the latest techniques, is very detailed and most importantly, uses only the highest quality products - even if he loses money on the transaction. My parents, who has to pay out of pocket, are happy with him. My young children are happy with him, always looking forward to see the dentist. Every one I've ever recommended is happy with him. There are multiple rooms in his office, the reason is he constantly spends money back to the business to renovate to the latest, fanciest equipment.<//text>

Had a bad experience at this office. The staff was nice enough, but the dentist was very blunt and rude (not only to me, but to his assistant as well). He was noticeably put off by me asking questions about the root canal and I was treated like I was stupid for wanting to know what was being done to me. It was very uncomfortable to have the procedure done and I am not sure about the quality of care they provide.  I wouldn't recommend visiting this office.<//text>

Oh wow! Fast, friendly and three perfectly matched fillings! I can't even count the number of dentists I've seen in my (middle-aged) lifetime or the amount of money spent on fillings, crowns, root canals, etc. Three fillings on the top of my bottom teeth wore/broke away so I checked google and found Sunnyvale Dental Care. The staff is genuinely friendly-not that fake LA friendly-and Dr. Terry is super! I can't recommend Sunnyvale Dental Care enough. And the best part? It only took an hour!<//review>

<Text>I had a broken tooth and it was very quickly addressed. I ended up having too much damage and the tooth had to be removed. I have severe anxiety and the staff were kind and gentle with that, but they ALSO told me the truth and what I would feel so I could prepare myself.

Thank you!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Dr Nasser Antonio's is by far the kindest and most attentive dentist that I have ever had. He replaced 3 aging fillings and walked me through every step of the process in a very clear way. He was exceedingly aware of how I was feeling and very careful and precise. He made sure the fillings fit perfectly and didn't cut any corners. I am tremendously pleased with his work, his demeanor, his attention to detail, and his attention to the emotional well being of his patient.

Also Julia at the front desk is a sweet :)<//review>

I came in with an emergency broken tooth and the dentist stopped his work to help me and fit me into his packed schedule. Words cannot describe the amount of joy and gratitude I have for Dr.Nasser the fact that ill be able to smile again, eat, drink function once again. This dentist office offers reliable and professional work, they take well care of thier clients and are very reasonable to discuss the problem you may have.< /text>

Dr. Antonius is the best dentist I have ever had. I had a large lapse in dental insurance, and as such needed a lot of work with an emergency dental visit being my first contact with his office. He quickly had me scheduled to fix the broken tooth, and built out a very detailed prescription of work to fix the other neglected teeth. What made Dr. Antonious different is that he brought me into building out the prescription making sure that I had an educated and active role in the work that needed to be done.

Dr. Antonious is very detail oriented, precise, and matter of fact in his dental prescriptions/assertions. He will then freely provide you with any information you need to make an informed decision along side him.

The receptionist treated me warmly from the first visit. This woman is a miracle worker when it comes to handling insurance, and works closely with the doctor to ensure you maximize your coverage. She would go so far as to build out different dental work schedules based on the doctor's noted priorities, and yearly coverage limits. She also handles scheduling and is proactive in all communications related to your upcoming procedures and any information related to your insurance.< /review>

I went in the chair with fears of pain. After the Doctor asked me what I was afraid of he explained to me all will be ok. And I must say he was 100% correct. He made me feel like I can do better the next time.<//review>

When I entered the door and signed in I was greeted by Julia, a very friendly, caring person who explained how to fill out the forms. The x-ray technician and dental assistant, Veronica, was very patient and thoughtful regarding my x-ray questions. Dr. Antonio was very thorough and also answered my many questions. All-in-all, this is a very professional and considerate establishment. You can tell that they want to do their best because it's noticeable in everything they do.</Text>

I went to Antonious Nasser because I read all of the great reviews. In hindsight, I believe many, if not most, of these reviews were paid for and not left by real people who went to Nasser for dental care. It started off with an excessive number of x-rays - nearly 20 when previous dentists I have been to never took more than 4 to 8. Then, Nasser did the actual cleaning instead of leaving it to a dental hygienist - presumably because he doesn't employ any hygienists. I didn't think he did a very good job and several times he seemed to get my gums as much as my teeth. There was also no fluoride treatment which is pretty standard at a regular trip to the dentist.< /Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I have been with Doctor Antonious for over  a year with several different dental conditions. His office arrangement, is in perfect  arrangement and spacious enough . The personnel  were pleasant ,  resourceful  and the perfect nurses when duty was called. Price arrangements were reasonable and the doctor was considerate enough to allow me to make a payment plan.  I was appreciative of that factor.!
When the doctor had to perform several difficult dental conditions his patience, professionalism were very evident. IF in the future calls for another appointment or other he's my first choice, and highly recommend him to anyone else.

Dr. Antonious has been my dentist for more than 9 years now. I find him very proficient and highly professional interacting with his patients. He is very honest and accomplishes his work with art. I also highly trust his technical opinions. I love the overall spirit of the clinic, clean, quiet and organized.

I would highly recommend him to anyone having trouble finding an exceptional dentist in the area.<//review>

I have been visiting Sunnyvale dental care since I was 11 years old... I love Dr. Antonious!! He has been taking care of my dental care and I would not want it any other way! My parents bring me here as a child and now I bring my kids here and I hope to continue on with the rest of our generations to come! Along with his expertise in the dental field he is polite and generous. Julie is also very welcoming and has been with him since I can remember. The office is always clean and very put together! Thanks for all you do!!</text>

<Text>I’m writing about our experience. I hope to be helpful to others. Long story short: Don’t Go to this place. He is not good neither technically nor  socially. I and my wife chose this place like everybody else from nice reviews. The place was nice and clean as was mentioned in the reviews but what matters most to me is the technical skills. None of us knows what a dentist does in our mouth unless we get a second opinion. My wife did a filling and I did two crowns and two fillings with this dentist. I went to visit one of my family members for Christmas. He is a great dentist and I asked him to check Dr. Antonio’s job. You cannot imagine how BAD the result was. There were gaps and partial cavaties in the new fillings of me and my wife both, and one of my crowns was short and its color was unmatched with the rest of my teeth and material wasn’t the one he promised. Having color images and Xrays, I disputed the fillings and my crown. What bothers me most is that Dr. Antonio is nonstop talking about how good his job is. He is so arrogant that you don’t dare to ask questions about what he is going to do with your teeth and he doesn’t explain either. I asked him once but he said I am wasting my time explaining details to you, I am an ARTIST and I am better to use my time for my art!!! Another thing that didn’t look right to me was putting my head position lower than my body when he was working on my upper teeth. I was upside down for 2 hours. Anyway, working with this dentist was a nightmare for us and I hope you guys not make the same mistake as we did. I did my job to warn you...< /Text>< pics>

Dr. Antonious had been taking care of my family and me for as long as I can remember. He is always kind, friendly, and makes sure  you always know what is going on when he speaks to you. I am almost always seen within 10 minutes of checking in. I have had teeth cleaned, fillings, and wisdom teeth removed by him. Always flawless processes with very little pain after he is done. He always prioritizes the care of his patients. Easily one of the best dentists I have ever met, both for patient comfort and his impressive skill.</text>

I have been going to this dentist for two years, and he does amazing work! He always cleans my teeth personally, and has pointed out directly what is going on with my teeth on the X-Rays in an open discussion. He is fast and the hours are convenient for the busy Silicon Valley professional. I highly recommend this dentist!< /review>

Definitely the best dentist you will ever find around the area that will accommodate all your needs. He is a friendly doctor who does his job professionally; while being determined and skilled in the simplest to the most difficult procedures. His office runs smoothly from first scheduling an appt (even if they are short notice), to the friendly staff and outstanding assistants, to short waits, regular checkups, and an extremely clean and profound clinic. His advice is guaranteed and he is driven to figure out the best solutions possible to make his patient comfortable and ease anything with no pain.<//Review><GmapID>0x808fb6615888c36b:0x1fc2a9452c53a679< /GmapID><rating>5< /rating><Date>1507532846489< /Date></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I don’t know why I was treated so poorly compared to others but I have an idea...I just moved to the area from Minnesota to start a great job next Monday.  Obviously I don’t have dental insurance at the moment because I had to quit my old job to take this one.  Thank had to make an emergency appt because an old filling fell out   If I hadn’t been in an 8 out of 10 in pain, I would have held out to see a dentist until I got the insurance.  When I saw the dentist, his first question was “why didn’t you see the dentist when you had insurance?”   How does a person answer that question?   Because I’m an idiot?  That’s what the question implies.  He said I need a root canal. Okay, but can something be done in the meantime for the pain?   Tylenol 3, which makes me nauseated and an antibiotic.  He showed no sympathy or caring, just cold judgment.

I have two stars because of the wonderful front desk person.

I left in tears and in pain. I won’t be back.<//Review>

The friendly staff and quality expertise of Dr. Nasser really set me at ease with each visit I had. Quick and precise work is what I've come to expect and its always delivered. Highly recommend for quality dental care.< /Text>< response>

I have been a patient at Sunnyvale Dental Care for a long time since about 1998 or so.
Service is always excellent.
I have a extremely low tolerance for pain and Dr. Nasser makes sure no matter the procedure he is performing on my mouth I am comfortable.
I would highly recommend if you are shopping for dentist to call for an appointment.
The service is great!
Oh! Did I say no pain?
Tell Julia and Dr. Nasser  that I highly recommended them to you.
I honestly give Sunnyvale Dental Care top rating of five stars out of five,< /Text>

Dr Antionous is a friendly and easy to talk to dentist.  He took the time to explain all of her dental procedure and work with patients on their dental issues.  All the procedure from him was quick and painless.

I hope the doctor doesn't retire for a while. He is pleasant, caring and enjoys his work.  He is helpful and make you feel comfortable.</review>

I have been coming to Dr. Antonious since I was a kid and my parents have been receiving his services for even longer. I think that's very telling of our experience with him. Personally, I can't imagine having any procedures done by anyone else. I have never had an issue with anything he's done for me--in fact, all his work is truly exceptional. He's one of the most meticulous and gentle dentists one could have and I would strongly recommend him to anyone.</Review>

<review>We have been going to this Dentist for the last 20+ years and our entire family is extremely pleased with his services, entire process, ease of making appointments, follow through, analysis, explaining treatment plan, costs and most importantly he always gets it right the first time . We get proactive phone calls every year for our annual cleanings. My most recent trip was last week when my tooth was wiggling and felt it was going to fall off. Dr. Antonious stayed late that same day to see me, then after x-rays and evaluation, he prescribed antibiotics and assured the tooth was safe. He called me twice this week to ensure I was doing fine. He treats his patients like family, he is caring and absolutely awesome.< /review>< userid>

I love the staff, very friendly, considerate, and thorough in explanation. The office itself is modest, but we all know how expensive property is around here.

Complimentary drinks to quench your thirst, free gas for cleanings (although I've always opted out), and a generally relaxed vibe.

Cleanings are pretty quick, about 45 minutes for me. If you are in the Sunnyvale or Mountainview area, I recommend this place.<//Review>

I called them for an appointment yesterday and wasted an hour giving all the info. promising to call back for somewhat of an emergency.
Today they didn’t call me and when I called after few hours they acted like they couldn’t be more bothered and didn’t even bother to check with insurance.

Completely unprofessional, rude and waste of time.</Text>

My dad came here to get some work done on several occasions by Dr. Antonious and the staff has always been kind, courteous and professional. Dr. Antonious himself is a fantastic dentist and really makes things quick, effective, and painless for his patients.

I absolutely recommend him and his entire clinic to anybody who has a fear of the dentist. They will alleviate your fears and get the job done with quality and caring precision.<//Text>

I just started seeing Dr. Antonious earlier this year and he is my favorite dentist so far. Over the years I've moved quite a bit and have had some different, and not always positive, experiences with dentists making me a bit wary of the dentist in general. In the past I have had dentists who have not done the best work and were dishonest and others who were just rough on my mouth making me dread visiting the dentist. Dr. Antonious is extremely honest and very gentle. He, along with an assistant, does the cleaning and is very considerate and gentle. His office is clean and his staff is professional and kind. While he identifies necessary problems that need to be fixed he also does not take advantage of patients by suggesting unnecessary procedures. His work is impeccable as he is extremely careful and detail oriented. He took his time when creating a mouth guard for me and when he covered some exposed dentin on my teeth he did such a good job that I couldn't even feel the difference in my mouth and my teeth looked better than they had before. The office is also very honest when it comes to billing. They do a great job of working with insurance and they are quick to inform you if a particular procedure will not be covered under your insurance. I definitely recommend Sunnyvale Dental and Dr. Antonious.< /Text>

Dr. Antonious has been my dentist for the past 7 years.
I'm very happy with all the help that the doctor and the staff have given me.
Dr. Antonious always took proper time to complete a job, with expertise, patience, and care.
There's never a sign of hurrying a job. High quality work is the order of the day.
The staff members are very friendly and efficient.
Great work all around. I highly recommend Sunnyvale Dental care.<//text>

The whole staff at the Sunnyvale Dental Care is great! Doctor knows for sure his work, and he was patient with me as my teeth are super sensitive . I remember, the first day I came there I was all crying and shaking. Ms. Julie assisted me really well, and doctor started to work on my tooth right away.< /text>

Dr Nasser Antonious is very professional, He always provides excellent advice and service. His staff is very courteous and very accommodating to my work schedule. The office is very tastefully decorated in a central Sunnyvale location. I always recommend Dr. Antonious to my friends and coworkers with confidence in his experience and great service.< /review>

<user>115268401456235470568<//user><review>Dr. Antonious has been my dentist for more than 15 years, and during all this time, he showed excellent professionalism, and great care for me as a patient! I have only good experiences with Dr. Antonious and his friendly staff, who work with you to make sure that everything is taken care of, and that you are in good hands. I appreciate his honesty (he's explaining all the pros and cons of the steps he's going to take), and his follow-ups after more complex procedures (there have been many times when he called me during his off hours to check how I was doing after the procedure). All in all, I would highly recommend this dental office anytime.<//review>< username>

<text>I have been visiting Dr Antonious for almost 3 years now, first for root canal and then for regular checkups.
Hes is the best there is.
He has a state of the art setup, is very patient in answering all questions that you have and explains all procedures in great detail and always puts you at ease.
His support staff, Julia and others, are also very friendly and genuinely care for the patients.

Thank you Dr Antonious</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I moved to Sunnyvale from San Francisco in 2008 and needed a dentist. My farther-in-law said he went to Sunnyvale Dental Care and was very satisfied. I made an appointment and have been a client ever since. Dr. Antonious is very caring and has kept my teeth is excellent shape.</Review>

Dr. Nasser Antonious was my dentist for 14 years and he did everything from cleaning to fillings and crowns, all still in good shape today.  He is a very skilled and knowledgable doctor, he is very meticulous, always up to date in his field and he has a great sense of humor. Just the way I like my dentist. Thank you, Dr. Nasser!
The staff is always courteous and nice, accommodating when it comes to appointments and insurances. I never had to wait longer than 10 minutes nor felt I was rushed. A special thank you to Julia who is always kind and makes me feel comfortable .
I definitely recommend Sunnyvale Dental Care to anybody who needs quality dental care.</review>

I have been a patient at Sunnyvale Dental Care for a very long time.  Dr. Antonious is one of the best and most professional doctor I have ever met.  He and his staff always go above and beyond their duty to make patients feel welcome and comfortable.  I am a very demanding patient and when it comes to my oral health and dentistry needs, I only trust is Dr. Antonious.< /Review>

I will remember Saturday, 7th July 2018 forever. I was on a flight from Atlanta to San Jose and was in excruciating tooth/jaw pain, almost on the verge of crying. I was unable to speak or drink water on 5+ hours flight. I got WiFi and texted my cousin asking her to immediately find me any Dental Surgeon. Somehow she found Dr. Antonious, and he agreed to see me, although his office was closed that day. I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful he and his staff were. He treated me like I was his long lost brother. His professionalism, his mastery in dental surgery and treatment, the love and care that he showered, his attention to detail, the quality of his work - I really have no words to explain. At the end I hugged him and said "You are God sent".  By the way, the experience has changed me as a person and how I treat others.< /Text>

Sunnyvale Dental Care is a great find!! Dr. Antonious, and the rest of the staff take great care of me each time I go.They're all super friendly and accommodating, always going above and beyond for their patients comfort. I'm always nervous before visiting any dentist, but Dr. Antonious was super nice, efficient, and gentle!
Dr. Antonious is very friendly and experienced. He takes the time to do a  complete examination, to give an accurate  diagnosis.  He makes sure you fully understand and invite question so that you feel confident.</text>

<Text>I have had the priviledge to work with Dr. Antonious for many years now.  He has always been very accomodating but most importantly, has taken care of my dental needs  with a great level of integrity and quality.  I know he will get to the point, explain what I need done, why it is needed without me worrying about unnecessary procedures...  I enjoy the light banter during the visit although it is very difficult to reply when a mouth piece is preventing you from talking properly...<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I imagine that many people are afraid of visiting the dentist (at least I was), but visiting Dr. Antonious is actually a pleasure.

He is polite and friendly with his patients (sometimes not so much with his assistants, who BTW also do a great job). He listens to all your concerns, but only carries out the interventions that he considers absolutely necessary. (Told me there was nothing wrong with a tooth that I was concerned about, and indeed the sensation went away in a few days.)

Overall, very professional, and in decades of going to dentists, this is the first one I go to without dreading it. :-)

[Note: After the last appointment Dr. Antonious requested writing a review. I don't think it's biased what I wrote above; just mentioning it for full disclosure.]< /text>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr Antonious for over ten years now and he has done everything from cleanings to root canals and crowns. My experience at Sunnyvale Dental Care has always been great. He has always been really good at explaining all procedures and has made me feel extremely comfortable and relaxed through my dental treatment. I have sensitive teeth and during cleanings Dr Antonious offers free laughing gas which makes my cleanings completely pain free and since coming to him I don't feel apprehensive towards having dental work and have full trust that the recommendations he gives me are sincere, professional and necessary. Dr Antonious is very knowledgeable, professional, gentle and  I would recommend him for all dental needs.</Review>< Pictures>

Like most people, I'm never too happy to have an aching tooth or know i might have a cavity- but having Dr. Antonious at Sunnyvale Dental Care as my lifetime Dentist- I never dread my appointments any more.
Dr. Antonious is very gentle and always makes the experience a good one. He takes care of the problem tooth and I get the best cleaning after. I would recommend Dr. Antonious over any other dentist I've ever been to.</text>

<Text>I am very happy with Sunnyvale Dental Care. The office always explains clearly what procedures are going to be performed and how much they are going to cost you after insurance etc. The appointments are always on time and Dr. Antonious is very professional and respects your opinion and decisions.</Text>< Name>

<review>Dr. Antonious is AMAZING!! I switched 6 years ago and couldnt be any happier! Amazing work with crowns, root canals, cleaning, and fast relieve. I have shown my crowns and work to other dentists and they are amazed. Dr. Antonious is the Picasso in dentist work. He does masterpieces in your mouth. Many many years in the field. My whole family now come see him. My sister lives in LA and come to Dr. Antonious for any work. And the price is great!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I know Dr. Antonious for at least 10 years, we crossed upon him because of a dental emergency with my father-in-law who was visiting us from abroad. I close friend personally recommended his dentist and said that I would be in good hands.  I got into his clinic with a non-English speaker father-in-law and was not only well received but cared for.  Dr. Antonious was throughout and very interested in helping and extremely patient since there was a language barrier and my father-in-law had very limited English. I remembered that Dr. Antonious allowed me to stay in the room while he was giving care and treated my father-in-law.  Amazingly, a few days later he personally called to check how he was doing.  For sure Dr. Antonious care goes beyond his clinic. He is passionate about his work, enthusiastic about dental challenges and highly motivated to solve them.
I am so grateful that since that unexpected visit to his office he became our family dentist.  He is reliable, perfectionist, knowledgeable and very direct about what need or don't need to be done.  I am so grateful that I have found Dr. Antonious and as my friend once told me, I tell you: You won't be in better hands!</Text>

<text>What I like about Dr Antonious is his honesty and Integrity.
He was my dentist and my son’s dentist for many years till I moved far away and started seeing another dentist who told me that I needed a couple of fillings, which I found odd because I’ve never had a cavity before.
So I seeked  Dr. Antonious as a second opinion and told him about my dentist’s findings.
Dr. Antonious did a thorough examination including x-rays and he assured me that I did not need any dental treatment in his opinion, he didn’t even charge me for that visit.
So it goes without saying, should I need any actual dental treatment rather than my usual teeth cleanings, I would definitely see Dr. Antonious for that. He is worth the drive.< /text><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I've been a patient of Dr. Antonious since 1996. Over the past 20 years I've been going to this clinic for my regular 6 month cleaning as well as the few dental emergencies that I had to go through.
One of the most things that I will never forget, When I had my wisdom tooth severe pain that kept me awake all night and I end up calling Dr. Antonious office number at 2:00 AM (I did't know what else to do), his answering service took all my details and to my surprise I received a call from Dr. Antonious at 6:30 AM to check on me and he got me an 8:00 AM appointment to take care of my emergency.
It's very rare to find someone committed to his patients like I felt that day.
Needless to say, Now that I have a family, we're all patients for the same clinic as I would not trust anyone else to take care of my wife and kid's dental needs.
Very quick notes,
- Very prompt appointments.
- Staff is friendly (specially Julia)
- The place is very hi tech in every corner (whether its the waiting area or the check in rooms)
Thanks much Sunnyvale Dental Care for the excellent service we've been getting for the past 20 something years.< /Text>

Dec 1999.  I had not been to a dentist in several years.  I found Sunnyvale Dental Care in my insurance booklet, and it looked like they could do most every procedure I thought I would need without my having to call other offices.  I was already embarrassed about my teeth, and I didn't want to have to call all over explaining how I let them get so bad.  So I nervously called Sunnyvale Dental Care, made that first appointment, ... and I have been going back ever since, including two weeks ago when I needed a routine cleaning and exam. That's almost 17 years as a patient.

Dr. Antonious is extremely talented and conscientious.  He is qualified/trained for most any procedure you might need, and if he thinks you should consider a specialist for certain procedures, he'll let you know.  I know, because he's done this for me.

Dr. Antonious has tried for years to help me hold on to the teeth I have remaining.  He has never recommended procedures I have not needed, and he is very aware of my desire to minimize costs while maximizing care.  And he lets me know if/when the choice I make is not the one he would make and why.  He'll also talk with me about alternative treatments.

Dr. Antonious has seen me in off hours for emergency situations, too.  He always makes me feel comfortable with the work he is doing, and he always takes pride in doing great work.  Sound like I'm happy with my dentist?  I AM.  And with all of his staff, too.

I hope you will not need any of the work I have needed, but if you do, you can feel good about trying Dr. Antonious/Sunnyvale Dental Care.  I attest to his abilities, and I recommend him to friends who ask.<//text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Hi Neighbors,

I was asked to enter my review here and I said - "Of course!". I know Dr. Antonious for many years, I think since 1998 and he has been our friend and doctor for all that time. My kids are now grown ups but they haven't changed their dentist provider regardless of the insurances offered within their new jobs.

I enjoy visiting Dr. Antonious office. I feel very welcomed, comfortable and safe every time. He is a person of trust and thanks to his professional recommendations I have been enjoying an excellent health for many years now. It's suitable to say that his personnel follow the same culture and they are excellent professionals, making this place even better.

It's fun to listen Dr. Antonious stories while I'm sitting on the dental chair which makes me laugh loud but since I can't, then I just make a thumbs-up.

The office and labs are very comfortable, neat and clean. You can even watch the game, your soap opera... :) or your favorite comedy show while the doctor or nurses are working on your teeth.

In short, Dr Antonious and his personnel are great people that make you feel like they are your extended family. I hope you enjoy this review and decide to visit Sunnyvale Dental Care in Sunnyvale.

Best regards,
Ronald Robles< /Text>< Pics>

I've been going to Dr. Antonious for my dental work for the past 3 years. Everytime Ive had dental work with him, its pretty much painless. He's always making sure that your having no pain at all. I just had a broken crown replaced by him and the time went by quickly. All the rooms have big flat tv screens to get your mind of the work being done. I know he is very detailed with his work so I know that whatever I get done, won't have to be done again. I would highly recommend his work. If you want quality dental work, he's the guy to go to. In the past, my previous dentist seem to always be on a rush, seeing 2 to 3 patients at a time. Totally different with Dr. Antonious, only takes one patient at a time and that's a good thing because hes been careful with what he's doing. One of the best dentist in the bay area.</Text>

< Review>
I learned of Dr. Antonious/Sunnyvale Dental  Care, after relocating back to the area after many years.  I searched the internet for a Dentist in the area. After placing telephone calls, searching the internet and speaking with numerous dental offices, I decided to try Sunnyvale Dental Care.  My decision and choice to try them first had alot to do with the first impression, the attitude, and personality of the front office staff.  His staff was very professional and welcoming.  Once I arrived there, my first impression proved correct.  The office was very clean, calm, and serene.  I noticed that the office wasn't crowded or loud, it was very peaceful and professional.  They seem to schedule appointments in such away where patient's scheduled time never over lap, and they call you back either early or right on time.  The staff was extremely professional and appeared honest, made me feel welcome and at home.
His staff will call you and confirm appointments, and appears to carry the same high professional standards as Dr. Antonious.  As I have learned now being a patient of Dr. Antonious, is that he's an AWESOME Dentist, one of the Best.  He really takes pride in his work, he is thorough, detailed, and hold high standards in his work.  He is very meticulous, detailed, careful, cares about his work and the job that he does. You never feel rushed, he takes his time and does the work well.  He appears to strive for perfection, is warm, knowledgeable, explains and informs while staying professional at the same time.  I really like him, and trust his work! If you want a dentist, who is warm, caring, does awesome, EXCELLENT WORK, Dr. Antonious is the Dentist for you!< /Review>

It's been a few years since I've been here. The food took a little longer than anticipated but it was soooooo good once it came out. My personal favorites were the Cucumber Skin roll & BSC roll. The monkey ball was also a pretty good appetizer.
Inside & outside dining open.< /Review>

<Review>Went in to order takeout.  Staff was friendly and food was ready within estimated timeframe. The sushi we ordered was phenomenal! Super fresh and tasty! (Try their Cucumber Skin Roll - it rocks!) Not a big fan of their dumplings...a little too doughy and the ginger was a little overpowering. Also ordered beef teriyaki don, chicken teriyaki don, cucumber salad and mixed tempura.  Those were super yummy as well! Looking forward to going back for a delicious dine-in experience!< /Review>< pictures>

Good sushi and other Japanese foods here. Tasty and nice presentation. Tempura and unagi are also pretty tasty and well prepared (compared to the ones I've had in Japan), as well as well priced. Great service too!< /text>

The service was  slow,  they seem to forget what tables order the food. We order sushi rolls. The rolls were small,  for the price.</Text>

< review>
The place wasn't really all that bad. I was in town on vacation from Arizona. I was there Tuesday night celebrating my  50th Birthday along with my Sister and 2 very close  friends from high school. These 3 have visited this establishment several times for they are from the area. At first, upon walking in, they  made us feel welcomed and were attentive to our needs and answered my concerns for I have food allergies. Our server, don't recall ever getting her name, at first seemed like she was happy to have us. We 4 can be a very lively group. Well the moment a large party walked in, she was more attentive to them even though their group wasn't all there. She never came back to check on us. Never asked how our food was, nor if we needed anything.  We were avoided as though we had the plague or something. Which turned turned my exciting time with friends and sister into a somber one. Teach your employees how they need to treat each of their tables with equal amounts of time and respect.</review>

If I could give this place zero stars I would. The food was not worth the price or the wait. After waiting for what felt a life time the food the finally arrived was small and didn't look good.</Text>

<Review>If you want good tasting sushi, dont come here. Not sure why, but seemed like imitation crab meat was their 'go to' ingredient. The seafood in the sushi bar wasn't displayed to see freshness like in other places. We visited on a Saturday night and there were only 4 people in there,  that should have been a sign for us to walk out.  Won't be returning.</Review>< gmapID>

The food tasted good, but the texture of the rice was off. More like basamati than sushi rice. Also, the service was extraordinarily slow. It was 45 minutes from when we placed our order till the food arrived.< /review>

Had a dish with chicken and beef. Both meats dry. Sushi rolls ok. Sashimi halibut, yellowfin and bluefin tuna good.  Toro tuna good. Might go back. First time experience was better.<//Review>

Great place. always good service and great sushi and rolls. My wife isn't a fish lover so she gets the chicken and its always good too.

I eat here once a month, my guess is the negative reviews don't represent what most of us know which is this is one of the best sushi places in southern california and I've tried a lot of them.

happy eating!< /Review>

<Review>Sushi is my favorite food and I eat it often from various places so I know my sushi and this place was bad. It’s nothing to do with the staff its just low quality sushi. I got a spicy tuna roll, spicy tuna crispy rice, and gyoza and I disliked everything. The spicy tuna tasted off and left a funky after taste. The spicy tuna crispy rice was sticky and got all stuck in my teeth and since it had tuna as well it also had that weird taste. Then the gyzoa was mushy, watery, and hardly cooked. I certainly won’t be coming back.</Review>< Rating>

We were allowed to sit anywhere we liked at lunch time and the chef made our sushi within 5 mins! Needless to say I will be coming back because everything we ordered was delicious (I had a surprise birthday lunch planned for my boyfriend but our original plans fell through at Kuma Sushi) and we got our to-go bag packed for us!  Their portions for size is incredible and they gave us a complementary Edamami with my order. My only negative is I wish I had more tip money on hand! :)
Try their hot soju!</Review>

Worst ever service seen in years. Waited for 20 minutes even two tables were empty. Requested server to please clean them up so we can be seated. She cleaned after multiple requests, and then made somebody else seated (who came after us) and started taking their order. Will not go to this place again. They don't know how to do business. Please avoid.</Text>

Good neighborhood sushi, everything was fresh, standard sushi rolls, the sushi/sashimi/handrolls are competitively priced. For grilled fish tell them not so blackened otherwise it'll come out blackened.<//Review>

<name>Elliott Park<//name><date>1477076697268< /date><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>**Salmon skin hand rolls are now $1.50 no longer $1.00**

I tried a variety of nigiri and also the lobster feast roll and fried jalapeño roll.
The fish was good--I've had better but no complaints.

I enjoyed the fried jalapeño roll! A must for cream cheese and jalapeño lovers.

Salmon skin hand rolls are a bit salty, so you probably don't want to dip them in soy. Otherwise are tasty and worth the $1.50

Staff was on point and food was served quickly.< /Text>< Pictures>

But when she did she was awesome and ended up taking our table because our server was MIA. I wish I had gotten her name because she was so sweet!

Jack's is absolutely phenomenal. I go here regularly and I'm never disappointed. Obviously because of covid we have to eat outside But they have tons of outdoor heaters and plenty of seating. Staff is great and very attentive. Literally everything on their menu is amazing. I also love the cocktails they have here. You really can't go wrong with this place</Review>

Jack's is just what the doctor ordered for main Street in Templeton.
Lots of room for outdoor dining, very effective heaters to keep you toasty as you toast with the best mixed drinks and cocktails in North Slo County!
From the bartender, to the hostesses,  to chefs and wait staff, EVERYONE is consistently on their A-Game, and sooooo friendly and fun!
The food  is amazing, prepared perfectly, served impeccably, and portions are a-plenty ++
Anytime  is a good time to head to Jack's,  my favorite is night time, the glowey, ambient light, fun and friendly energy make the experience that much more enchanting!
Head Jack's , you'll be glad you did, it will brighten your day, and I guarantee you will return for more at your next chance for dining fun!
Oh, and one last thing, all this, comes at very reasonable prices!
Even better!!!<//Text>

Jack’s has great food and a great bar. The servers are friendly and fast. The atmosphere is for the young and old. There’s a live band from time to time. They have indoor and outdoor seating.
They are also being safe during Covid 19</review>

<Review>Well, some places can handle this Covid thing, and some can't. Jack's can't handle it. I was given a 15 minute wait time - it took 45 to seat me. Now I'm sitting here 30 minutes after being seated, watching other groups get served, and I haven't even been asked if I want a drink. Get it together Jack!</Review>< GmapID>

We have eaten there several times. The service has always been excellent and the staff is attentive. The food is outstanding. The bloody mary’s are to die for. You can get then spicy or mild. Will continue to go to Jacks.< /Text>

< review>
Worst service ever and the place wasn't even busy. We only ordered appetizers and drinks, took forever to get our drinks and another 10 minutes before waitress took our order. When the food arrived it was cold and greasy. Never came back to see if we  needed anything and fi ally had to go ask for our own check. Don't know what happened to the owners who called it Ninos, but wish they were still there.<//review>

Great service, large menu to choose from. My friend had the Rueben and said it was great. I had the Ahi Poke bowl. Very little Ahi  and the rice was horrible for $18 dollar dish.</Text>

Didn't get to try the food - gave up waiting to be served ... felt like we were invisible, and we were sitting in the very front at the counter. Probably won't try again.< /text>

<Text>My wife and I have tried several of the menu items now, and the generous portions, the excellent quality, and the reasonable prices, are truly impressive.  There are many fine restaurants in the North County, and this restaurant is quickly becoming our favorite go-to place to eat in this area.< /Text>< username>

As always,  Big Tuna has my vote of confidence!! They always have great service! The food is delicious and I've never had a problem with a server. Although today my order was wrong(  I've never had this happen here), they made it right and then some! The second pic is from a previous visit<//review>

<review>Found hair on my sushi roll!! That’s extremely unhygienic and gross. They are service is very very poor. Everytime I ordered something they are always missing something even though I specifically mentioned to give the wasabi on the side. They always forget to give chopsticks. I went to pick up and the lady was on her phone the whole time and I had to wait forever even though I placed the order an hour before and they said it will be ready in 20 mins. Very disappointed. They were good once but now they’re just reluctant.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>The best option for all you can eat sushi in the Antelope Valley. Chefs and servers are swift and courteous. The food is presented well and they allow "easy rice"and half-roll ordering which let's you sample a broad array of their offerings. Price is on the higher end of the spectrum for lunch in the area but is worth spending for the unhurried AYCE dining. A top of advice, the waits to get seated at the bar on a popular night can top 45 min so if you are headed out on "date night" do yourself a favor and call to have your name put on the list in advance.  Enjoy! Tell them Patrick sent you. 😉< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMQL_PgX0TJxy72TwFBNMGOW6jrjPzyRxt46NW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxahgYA57eNPIOPGp-UH497475VZYWJVELlSCE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKg0a-JIi9DxPf1aO-XvZKyrKncZNmAdjznHsP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDi9lI6nJF9-SRXL23eZYgbCkzvHT5yo2JJdBD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfZRdG4SHmrLfhIDl_NgTSW45BUNe4EE4y12pa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwtFOJisI9SWOctUAPq8mPXzUU_5zdXOGI2RAN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVn-VOgVtmsmVGx1JncVYmfk0_1nFBMlI_LAed=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxajE60p9QyngzMAX645MBKldwM0gXpcv1bRd4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsxSaAnoPzlVOOAc3PcZo7L2N5tHjmCCkSpP9J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFq7rkGln_GxxyZZKNFVsuHcg6B_Ix0-KT3dPi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHmlmXwE0oHznEhFfDXRXd3ri3XH8EEjTUtxPi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGPXgtwJK-xu2NMgzpcXMyGtLJM7_dBdW0L05k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK8nxScG9dL592svr4-wZJCWMdJyeMVqHWA2Sz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkfNVJkmEmZARIcIeM9h7PFWdfHga7Jpaso3XR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmPKuWh4mBCzqXkX4Lw4PgSnvvUKnp2yUbDk50=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Working in the mojave area and came to town for groceries and stopped at big tuna. Big tuna is BOMB A/F. $29.95 all you can eat is well worth it (every penny). It’s hard to find good sushi 🍣 restaurants, I had several different rolls, sushi and appetizers and they were all good. I will be back and with friends who also like sushi.< /review>

Sushi is all stale rice and barely any imitation meat or fish. Soup is lukewarm and quality is overall just bad. I get rolls from CC hawaiian on the east side that are fresher and more consistent.

They are always busy and clearly have customer's but I think it's only because people don't think there is anything better but I am positive that there is

Food sucks. Sorry but it does. Chef's are lazy.</text>

<name>Luis Alvarado</name><Text>This place is terrible! Save your money. I left red salmon to come try the all you can eat. Worst decision I’ve ever made. The fish was good, but the preparation of the rolls was trash. The servers were great, I had problems with the chef’s attitude. This guy literally forgot my order more then once and still told me he forgot and ran out. Went on a smoke break more then twice. 😂 seriously this place is a joke.

<review>Hubby and I had originally went to the closeby Chili's for dinner. But, service was pretty limited and we left Chili's. The people already seated looked miserable 🥺 Best decision was to go to Bigtuna. Very modern vibe ☺️ Food quantity is worth the price. Excellent customer service! All around great experience 👍</review><rate>5<//rate>< date>

We like this All You Can Eat Sushi restaurant the most compared to others in the area, the staff are polite and accommodated to our needs. Sal was our chef at the bar and he was very busy with a large party order but still found a way to prepare our orders in a timely fashion. Price was typical for dinner and the restaurant is usually packed especially on prime nights. Food was delicious, fried foods were crisp, portions of rolls were just right, 1/2 rolls are available, the only complaint I had was AYCE Sashimi is extra but other then that I definitely recommend this place!<//Text>

Good food. All you can eat is expensive compared to all the other places. The guy making the sushi talks way too much so that’s the reason for 4 stars. I was satisfied overall with the experience< /Text>

Then handed my cup back to me after she hand washed my same cup and didn't discount me for the inconvenience. Our food we ordered was $35 and not filling at all. Large x box roll was not what we expected. All of the chef's were great and really nice. Thier owner or main manager who ever she is needs to have a better attitude. Not satisfied!

My girlfriend and I come here once or twice a month. They have great service and the guys at the bar are always fun to listen to. The place is clean and the food is always fresh, with tons of options. I normally get the lunch/dinner combination depending on what time it is, which I find to be a great deal. We've tried other sushi restaurants around the AV but this tops them all. Always leave feeling full and satisfied.
I recommend the Good Choice Handroll!<//text>

honestly right off the bat im not gonna lie it was ok. i mean its a buffet for $30+ dollars what would you expect, some of the waiters are rube but i understand  you are rushing to get things done. if u want to enjoy the atmosphere and have someone prep you're food its fun. but thats all fun. my sister and her Bf love this kind of place for me i rather eat a little less or less but better food taste. sacrifice taste for $$$ its hard but hey if u wanna stuff you're face come on in<//review>

Not what it used to be.  Horrible, horrible service!  My family and I love sushi and big tuna is always our go to for sushi in the av.  However, the last few times we have gone service has not been the same.  Decided to go yesterday and our server clearly was not happy with servicing us at the all u can eat bar.  The experience went down hill from there.  Therefore, we have decided to frequent another sushi spot!!<//text>

Tried their all you can eat bar for my birthday. It was phenomenal, and well worth the 28$ for a treat. Also had hot sake for the first time, only 3$ for happy hour. Tasted great with the sushi -- a bit like vodka with a fruity hint. I've had their dinner combo before too and never been disappointed: I will be back.< /Review>

Best sushi I ever had, bar none. For the Antelope Valley, it's crazy that we find a restaurant this good when about everything else is garbage. Even on an international point if view, it's litterally amazing!

The fish is fresh, delicious, tender, buttery and their interpretations of the classics are phenomenal. You NEED to try the "Maine Roll" (a baked lobster sushi concoction that's just demented).

They have a "all you can eat" sushi bar and happy hour saké, so bring your appetite and enjoy sushi after sushi until your belly pops.

I much prefer the ambiance of this small restaurant (compared to the Palmdale location) as it feels more Japan-typical and cozy.

Definitely a 10/10 for me!</Review>

Best all you can eat sushi bar I have ever been to.

Best part is you can get all you can eat 1/2 rolls. This way you can get a bigger variety of rolls during your session.

If all you can eat sushi is what you are looking for, nothing will compare to this place.</Review>

<Text>Bif flavor. One of the best. There are several choices nearby and a little farther away; all within the AV, but Big Tuna is very consistent with their sushi and rolls. I can't wait until the new location is open since it is closer to home.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

The sushi and the service is pretty good normally, but I've been scared to come back after sometime last summer; when their air conditioner was out or something and they just had standing fans blasting everywhere. It definitely smelt like a rotting big tuna inside the dining area, and that was enough for me to turn right around and walk out.<//Text>

Service was superb and the sushi was fantastic. I suggest trying the Lemon Zinger. It is a treat and full of flavor. I know for a fact I'll come again. One of the best sushi dinner in California hands down on that. *Cheers*< /review>

I used to love going to Bigtuna. I've gone here for years. However, I've always avoided one of the chef's for good cause. He's an Asian man in his mid 40s (just a guess). Every time I've had him I get poor service. He's always in a crumby mood, etc. Last night I had him again and he completely ignored me and my fiancee. Another couple sat down (I'm guessing they new him) and bought him a beer. He then gave them his full attention. Another one of the chef's saw this and then started to prepare a few things for me. I'll buy my chef a beer if they are being good to me. It's a reward for being a pleasant person, not a debbie-downer.

The younger chef's are awesome, and the waitresses are always very sweet.

Just avoid the chef I spoke of and you'll have a fantastic time. I honestly don't plan on going here anymore.< /Text>

Just got back from taking my son, two friends, husband and myself out for our son's birthday celebration.  We all sat at the sushi bar, and being that my son is a vegetarian, I didn't expect to see too much variety come his way. Boy, was I wrong!  The gentlemen behind the bar are true artisans! The assortment of flavors, colors, and textures that they offered him throughout the evening was something to behold.  Almost made me wish that I had chosen vegetarian fare, as well.  But don't get me wrong; the baked salmon roll and 69 roll were the best I've ever had!  I just wish that I had made more room for all the other enticing delicacies .  Service was great, as was the friendliness of the staff. Will definitely be going back!< /Review>

All you can eat at the bar is $26.99 and worth every penny of you are hungry. Fresh fish, friendly service, attentive chefs at the bar. If it's busy order two or three items at the once so you don't have long waits for your next item.< /Text>

<Review>Pretty sure the sushi they serve here are drugged because I can’t stop coming back. I don’t even live in the area but I find myself making the three hour drive... I think I might have a problem.

But seriously, the baked rolls here are to die for. Savory, smoked flavor that enhances the already delicious rolls they make topped with pieces of bonito flakes. Delish! I’ve come here several times and sometimes, the wait is long but totally worth it.

If I could inject this stuff into my veins, I’d do it.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>To be honest the sushi was not great. Our rolls were served with quite a bit of sauce on them, and the fruits/vegetables used weren't as fresh as I am used to.</review>< Pics>

Mitch's review should be ignored! We went here last night. It was wonderful. I know what kind of person Mitch is, how pathetic! You're mad because you didn't get more sea urchin or fish eggs. You picked the two most expensive things on their menu and got mad cuz he didn't give you more what did you want to do eat 5 lb of each!</Review>

<text>I wanted to treat my Wife to some sushi so we came here for the lunch special. the waitress was very kind and attended us quickly! we waited for the food and when it came...it was kinda horrible. i know this is strong to say but the California roll that came with the lunch special was old, and rough like rubber...super chewy and what would make matters worse the wasabi was really dark close to black dark, like if it was also very old. we couldn't eat anything and when we told them that, they didn't seem to care. they literally came said "oh sorry about that" picked up the plates and left. i was aw stuck, not only did i pay them for the lunch special they came said sorry and took it back. when i asked for the manager they said his name was nick and is not available, i have called twice within 4 hours apart from each other and same response. feels like a sick joke! if anyone with common sense came to this place and saw this...THEY WOULD NOT EAT ANYTHING! im very angry about the response of this establishment and i hope they get investigated by the city's health inspector.<//text>< pics>

<rate>2< /rate><text>I haven't been here in a while and likely won't be returning to the Lancaster location. This is a photo of their Ultimate Shrimp Roll. This place used to have large, fresh rolls. This roll is not fresh at all and its tiny.  Even their rice was old and dried out. Also, the service left a little to be desired as well. I asked for wasabi 3 times before it finally arrived and we were in on Saturday with plenty of staff conversing about.  Not to discredit a of the food though. We ended up ordering a bento box instead as it seemed like a safer bet today, which was pretty tasty.<//text><Time>1541883454957</Time></record>

Don't go here.  The receptionists are incapable and the service is good SOMETIMES.  I called before i came in to make sure i could eat on my break.  I get there they sit 8 ppl in front of me then tell me there's a 20 minute wait after i already waited 10. Better places to take your service it here are red salmon,  harbour and love sushi.  Won't be coming back here again since tgis is the second tine they've done this.< /text>

I've stopped going there because the teriyaki chicken was NOT properly cooked or maybe it was just bad meat..felt raw and could not possibly eat it. It was the same for a few times. I came back today and still the same issue. Its either they don't let it defrost, whatever but, its just awful.< /Text>

Low quality sushi and extremely rude service. They offer all-you-can-eat but I'm not sure why since you can tell that the staff absolutely despises it. Chefs will ignore you until they decide you should have another roll. Waitresses act annoyed if you stop them to request an item. The staff couldn't make you feel more uncomfortable for attempting to eat in their restaurant. I asked for easy rice and they completely ignored the request. I ordered a green dragon roll but the chef made a totally different one and when I pointed it out he just looked at me, nodded and went about making a different order. Some of the sashimi was tasteless and rubbery which I assumes means it wasn't fresh. Literally every other sushi place I've been to in the AV is better.< /Text>

<date>1466903861441<//date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>First time I've been in here in about a year and it was not worth it. I took my girlfriend out for all you can eat on her birthday and got served lots of room temperature sushi, which is very unappetizing. On top of that, aside from a few rolls, every roll is the same and tastes like it. The cherry on top is that they now charge 27.50 for their all you can eat, which is hardly a deal, especially at the quality you're getting. I'd much rather have Harbour Sushi in Palmdale, which has many many more creative rolls. They also give you thicker portions of fish so that you're not eating primarily rice. The staff was alright, but I'm not going back for the price and lack of quality you get in their sushi.</text>< pics>

Nice chefs :) if you sit at the bar it is all you can eat; sushi+appatizers for 30 $. if not you can sit at the tables and have menues. Dont reccomend going after 5 pm it will have an hour + wait. The waitresses are always very nice. Great place for date night.</review>< user>

For the longest time I was afraid to try this place, sticking to my usual sushi places thinking that this was just a knock off of all the other ones, but one day someone brought me here for a work lunch and I fell in love with it. This is the best sushi place in Lancaster! It can be a bit pricey but all in all great quality food and very quick!< /text>

Their food is decent but a lot of their staff are rude. I have been coming here for years and they get more and more rude as the years go by. I feel like because they are a popular restaurant they think they can be rude and people will still come back. A smile on your face while saying something rude does not make things better.< /Text>

I went here with a friend of mine it was my first time. I had ordered the shrimp and crab roll. They came back and told me that they gave me the wrong roll and then when they came back with my plate it was still the wrong sushi roll. I told them that I ordered the shrimp and crab roll not this cooked chicken roll. I don't know if I would ever come back to this restaurant again.< /review>

Terrible service. Here now, my wife and daughter got their food, my son and I have been waiting for over 15 minutes for our 3 rolls. No longer kids menu. Took a table instead of all you can eat because we didn't want to wait for the bar. Horrible.< /text>

<username>Ralph Garcia< /username><text>The food is to die for, wish the all you can eat was also at the table.
The chefs are great Danny, Max, Melvin, Sinh (sorry of is misspelled) are awesome chef's.
The only downside is the waitress Fawn, Phan (not sure how to spell it) always has an attitude, over charges for anything she can, I share some edamame and miso with my daughter and she said it wasn't part of the menu.
I believe I will not eat ever again whe she is tending.
Best spicy tuna in the Av.
The wait is well worth it but sometimes to long.

Wish they had  baby changing tables in the restroom.< /text><Rating>3< /Rating>< Date>

<Text>A friends couple invited us to lunch. They go there every Saturday religiously. We were seated, drink orders taken, and we waited patiently for our appetizers. Our wives got their salad and soup in a timely manner, apps arrived in a decent amount of time. Then all he'll broke loose. My wife received her entree, then 5 mins later our companion's wife got her entree. Then 5 mins passed. Then 10. Then I had to ask for a refill after my waitress walked by 3 times. Still no entree for me or my friend. Finally asked the waitress where our food was.  She apologized, and went to check. 4 mins later a different person brought my roll out, dropped it in front of me, and walked off. I said "About time", to which he replied back, mimicking me in a sarcastic tone"About time". I stood up and went to the manager, filed a complaint and left.

4 tables were served their entire meal while I waited. I was offered little apology.

First and last time I go there.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c25afaa923c815:0x501f883618162642< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place has some decent options for sushi, my biggest surprise was that they offer fatty tuna
Not a bad place to stop for a bite, but expect an average 15 min wait</Review>

This place is always packed. I've never been able to get a seat. My boyfriend hates it, but I've never been able to judge it for myself. Thankfully there's another place like two blocks down the street. At this point, I'm just irritated at how many times I've shown up at this establishment just to be turned away.< /review>
