<review>Best Pho in town! Kim has been here the longest and it comes through in the traditional dishes.. authentic and fresh. I have been coming here for years and I have never been disappointed (I’m pretty picky when it comes to pho). Family owned and operated! The way the broth is made is levels above all the new places that have recently opened. Support this local gem and eat at Kim’s.< /review>< rate>

Fantastic, elegant, highline Vietnamese cuisine, and also Pho. 35 years in Encinitas, same family, fantastic food the whole time.
If you haven't tried Vietnamese food, this is where you should go to start. Ask for suggestions and prepare to be amazed.

Great service, great price, large portions, fast, remember, they are Vietnamese, they don't want you taking your "sweet time" on the table to eat your meal, that's their culture, if you can handle that and don't get offended by getting your bill before you ask or finishing your meal, you will enjoy this place.

<text>The key point about Kim's is that they adapt traditional Vietnamese cuisine for healthy eating. For example, they offer steamed spring rolls in addition to the traditional fried spring rolls; they offer brown rice in addition to the traditional white rice; the lemon grass wrap is packed with raw, fresh veggies; and so on. It's a little expensive considering the ambiance, but it does fill a niche for health conscience people who want Vietnamese food.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Try the tomato sauce chicken and Cashews, it's not like what you would think of tomato sauce, it has much more flavor and is so good.</review>

<Text>Pretty disappointed in this place. Used to eat here quite frequently, the last three times have been progressively worse. The food is alright but the service is horrendous. We keep wanting to give it "one more chance" because it used to be so great, no more chances...We went back to eat this last time, our appetizer took forever to come out. The food was good. We waited. And waited and waited a little bit longer for our entree. I looked around, still no entree. With four people in the restaurant I thought we could have a quick lunch. Still waiting, finally someone comes by and puts a check on our table. They even had our entree on the check, just not on our table or in our stomachs! We told them to forget about it and we'll close out. We got a sorry, but in the industry this is just down right wrong. I would give this a one star if the food wasn't good and since we used to have a good experience here. I believe the original owners retired and their kids took it over, I hope they own the building, because then at least there is an asset. Disapointed to say the least.<//Text><rate>2</rate><username>RepublicOf Encinitas< /username><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dc0c4194034d17:0x275d4d04e8349caa</GmapID>< userid>

I was so disappointed they tried to rip us off and over charge us for everything we ordered. Also charge us for things we didn't get. So sad at one time I liked this place. Now I will tell everyone I know to never go to this place. Bad bad people then they try to play stupid like they didn't understand😖😡 never again.< /Text>

This place is not authentic and terrible. Price is on the high side. My bowl of pho was smaller than normal and just ok. Hot and sour soup had too much vinegar. Egg rolls were more on the Chinese side than Vietnamese.</text>

<review>May 27, 2019 (Memorial Day).
The last day Black Coffee Draft House will be open.  So apparently our First... and Quite Sadly our Last Time here.  Food was Excellent!  Service by Jamie and Patricia were On Point!  Chef Shayna is a True Master Chef!!!
And the current Entertainment provided by Gil K. And Ali Jo IS Phenomenal!!!
Owners of Black Coffee Draft House, if there is ANY Way to stay open, PLEASE Consider It!!  Even though we're 50+ miles from home, we WILL make you Our Spot!

Donna and Clayton, I'd Your Place Rocks!!  👊😉🤘<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Great place to eat in the Frazier Park area. Worth the small detour off the 5 freeway if you’re passing through. Good selection of food, extremely friendly staff, fun decor and seating areas, live music upstairs. You will pay slightly more than other places in Frazier, but it’s worth it. House made sodas compliment their meals nicely. They roast their own coffee and have bags for purchase. My only small issue was the coffee - I would have liked it to have more developed flavors for being freshly roasted. But still, a great little restaurant overall. If I’m ever in the area again, I’ll come here.< /Review>

<text>Last night we went for the entertainment, Samantha was singing upstairs. My tiny human had the chicken basket, my husband and I had their special event plates. He had the steak and I had the salmon. DELICIOUS! And the Black Coffee Stout is out of this world. Can't wait to go back. This was our 3rd time there. Staff is excellent as well.<//text><name>Jessica Valenzuela (Jessi)</name><GmapID>0x80e9f39471942d67:0xc85508352f2fb942<//GmapID>< Rate>

<Review>This is the most amazing coffee house I have been to. I am currently visiting from Dallas, Texas. I had their cheeseburger with fries and a nitro brewed coffee. It is the best coffee I have had during my visit. The owner, Clever, gave us a tour of his facility & explained how he produces their own coffee. You will love this business & the staff.< /Review><GmapID>0x80e9f39471942d67:0xc85508352f2fb942< /GmapID>< userid>

<Review>First time going in today and it was FANTASTIC! I had the chicken blt sandwich and the BEST sweet potato fries I have ever had; and fries are my life.

I don’t drink coffee so I never thought to go in, assuming it was just a coffee shop. If it wasn’t for my boyfriend that would probably have stayed the case.  So glad I went, and I will go back.

Support local business and eat at the Black Coffee “cafe”, and coffee house :)<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80e9f39471942d67:0xc85508352f2fb942</gmap_id></record>

Food was good, coffee was good, service needs work.... owner was really sweet other lady was terrible. Completely ignored us there is one member of the staff that needs to be fired. Clean house, get friendly helpful staff, treat people like they just dropped 40 dollars on lunch cause I did. The owners seemed legit but if they take there business seriously they must get rid of the middle aged lady working behind the counter. She needs an attitude adjustment. I never give reviews, but I think the owners need this information. I drive by there all the time and now I won’t ever go back.< /text>

Late night taco run?! Los Tapatios got you covered. Make a quick stop to get your tacos de asada, al pastor y lengua. Takes cash only but the environment with la radio on and the lively chatter makes up for it. Un taco de asada con todo por favor!< /Text>

The tacos and service were excellent. You can find the best tacos Mexico city style here. Also they have burritos, tortas, mulitas and quesadillas. I totally recommend this taqueria ( mexican food) for taco lovers.<//review>

<text>Fantastic service at a great price! The spring on my garage door broke and I called a few places on a Saturday at 4 p.m. Some wanted to charge me an exorbitant emergency fee, and I was ready to wait until Monday.  These guys said they could come out within an hour and wouldn't charge me anything extra. Their price was fair and communication excellent. The technician was professional and finished the job promptly.

Bottom line, excellent service, great communication and fair pricing.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< pics>

They described what I could look for myself and try to fix, but also offered to schedule a service call.  I followed their recommendation and fixed it myself.  Not many companies are willing to teach/empower potential clients how to fix problems themselves instead of charge to come do it themselves.  Well done Garage Door Experts!</review>< user_name>

<Text>I called at 10a to get a quote and to schedule, having been ghosted by a few other vendors.  By 330 I had an app enabled garage door opener and everything working.  This was efficient and easy - these guys are awesome.< /Text>< pics>

Joshua answered the call in the morning and made an appointment between 12 and 1pm same day.  At first I thought something wrong with the garage door opener.  Joshua pointed to the broken hinge at the side of the door and advised to change the torsion spring.  The repair was done within an hour and the price is fair.  Highly recommend Joshua for any garage door repair work.<//Text>

<Review>I’ve used Garage Experts twice (broken spring and new lifter), actually had the same person come both times. They seem pretty popular so scheduling issues may occur, but they communicated and tried to find other people to cover if possible. The work done both time was excellent.<//Review><Time>1579547022120</Time><username>Chris Chua< /username><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This was an awesome experience with Joseph G. from Garage Door Experts.  He communicated with me about arrival time, and called to revise the time as he was even able to come EARLIER than scheduled.  He listened carefully to my concerns and thoroughly examined all 3 of my single garage doors/openers.  He examined all 3 doors and showed me why certain repairs were advised, and was totally professional!  EVERYTHING got done in less than 2 hours, and my 25 year old garage doors open like they are new! I would call them back in a second if I have any need for repairs to my garage doors/openers!  THANK YOU JOSEPH!!!!!!</Review><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

<review>Joshua was prompt in giving me a quote and answers all of my questions.  Joseph was the actual person who came and did the work.

A five star for this company because of the professional attitude and work they have done to my garage door. The door was buckled due to backing up with my car while it is still close. I cannot put it to to work just to remove  my car but the Garage Door Expert has done a wonderful job. The door is warp but functional. Thanks to Joshua for job well done !!!!<//Text>

<Review>I happily give this company, and Joshua, who provided the service, the highest rating.  Tops in multiple categories: promptness of responding, depth of knowledge about garage doors and trouble-shooting door problems, absolute professionalism (backed up by quick and thorough text and e-mail communications).  So glad I chose this company to repair my door, would tell anyone to do the same.</Review>< pictures>

I appreciated that he inspected every portion of the garage door to ensure all the components were still in good working condition. Pricing was very fair too! Very pleased with the quick replacement, it only took an hour!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Thank you Joseph for once again providing trustworthy service! This is the second time I called Joseph, this time for my GF's garage. Again very punctual, great communication and most of all trustworthy. On my previous job I was quoted $800 by another firm. Joseph fixed it in literally minutes for $85. This time it was also a quick and economical fix. No sales BS, just getting it done. That's why I trust these guys and have recommended them to friends that also use them. Will never go with another company. Thanks again.</Review>< user_id>

I was so impressed with this team.   They were responsive to an urgent situation late on a Saturday afternoon.   The technician, Joseph, was professional, thorough and comfortable to have around our home.  He was here into the evening in order to fix our door, and prevent future emergencies.   Their prices were reasonable, and the service was excellent.</Text>

Garage door Experts are great, I would highly recommend them.  We had another company install our garage openers and just yesterday our garage door went off track and I couldn’t close the door, so I tried to call the other business  but never received a call back so I called Garage Door Experts and had some one out to fix the problem in about an hour.  Joseph, the technician arrived and was very friendly and professional.  He gave me what my options were and explained everything very well. He got everything quickly back in working order better than what it was before.
We will definitely Garage door Experts when we decide to upgrade our garage doors in the near future.</review>

<Review>I had a great experience with Garage Door Experts. From the moment I called I was given flexibility as far as scheduling, which i appreciated. I also really liked the fact that I received text messages to see how far away my technician, Joseph Greer was and what his ETA was. Upon arrival, Joseph was excellent in diagnosing the issue, ordering the part for repair, rescheduling the repair and finally repairing the issue while addressing a few other small issues. I highly recommend them!</Review>< pics>

<text>Tech was straight forward and knowledgeable. Joseph made everything work with my old garage railing and tightened everything down. It's very stable and operates very smoothly and quietly. He made sure I got the best price available as well. I love the fact that they provide same day estimation and install. Definitely recommend.<//text></record>

<review>Our garage door spring broke on Saturday night, and we were lucky connected with Joshua next day on Sunday. Joshua provided his professional advice with reasonable price for both the top rating springs with 9 years warranty. Detail quote over the phone and came in the afternoon the same day.

When I watched on and enjoyed his work, I could simply tell what does it mean by the skill set. Joshua replaced the broken springs, checked the door alignment and balanced the door, lubricated the joints, reset the door opener. Awesome work! I'm highly recommend Joshua to all home owners who need a garage door job.</review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

<Text>Joshua was fantastic.  Our garage spring broke on a Sunday afternoon the day before I was headed out of town.  I called to see if I could get it scheduled for my wife to handle while I was out.  I expected Tuesday at best but Joshua was able to come the same day (Sunday) with in 2 hrs and knocked out the whole repair.   He was extremely courteous, explained everything and did a very quick and clean job.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  I was so appreciative not only of the efficient and professional manner in which my garage door was repaired, but I was assured that backing into your garage door was not as uncommon as I convinced myself that it was.
It really looks great and, more importantly, works great!  Thank you again!< /Text>

<text>Joshua is so professional. He identified the problem quickly after checking and provided recommendations. He has the parts right in his truck and can solve the problem immediately. He also explained to me why it happened. After work he actually cleaned up every single piece of residues out, also helped me to fasten every bolt of the door. I am so impressed by his professionalism. Would recommend to anyone looking for professional garage door service.</text><Rating>5<//Rating>< userid>

They did a great job installing a new garage door for my mom.  I did all the communication by phone and the install went exactly as they said it would.  They even came back the same day when my mom had questions and couldn't get the door to work.  Thanks for all the patience.</review>

Garage Door Experts have repaired my garage door twice in the past 6months once at my residence and second at my temporary residence I have a bad habit of rushing and backing out the garage before the door is completely up so you know what happens the panels get knocked off and garage door is off track. Both time garage door experts have came out were reliable and did not charge me a lot of money or tell me I needed to replace my entire garage door unlike other garage door repair business. My garage doors are still operating perfectly and look like nothing happened to them. Thanks< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I called Garage Door Experts when my garage good refused to shut all the way down. It was a Saturday and I want very sure if any repair establishment would be open. Joshua responded and promised to check in, and he was true to his word. Our garage door was old and before fixing, he provided a detailed estimate and explanation as to the source of the problem. Not many people do that. Needless to say, I am happy with his work and recommend his services.< /review>< pics>

A great company. Very courteous, they take the time to explain things, and always tell you if they're running late.

This job was a challenge. The opener had to go into an awkward space, and other companies had suggested a solution that would have forced us to buy a much more unit.. Garage Experts saw right away that with a few minor adjustments everything could be made to fit -- top marks for creativity and thoughtfulness. Then they did the job quickly and right. Real pros.

I recommend them with no hesitation at all, and will use them again when the time comes.</Text>

What a great company. Joshua said he would service my house right away. Joseph Greer fro m the company texted me and called to say he would be out within a hour. Joseph was very professional. He looked at my door and said he would fix it that night. He quoted a very fair price before starting and said I would be able to use the door in a hour. I am very pleased with the service, communication and price from garage door experts..I highly recommend this company.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Called on Saturday morning and made an appointment for that afternoon.   Josh called 20 minutes before he arrived.   I described the problem and he offered a couple of solutions.   He made the necessary repairs and also lubricated the door and tightening all of the bolts.  Throughout the process we talked about the door and the garage door opener.  He shared a lot of information specific to our setup and things to look out for.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><date>1525548115346<//date><Text>My house is in escrow.  I needed to replace my garage door before we close.  Josh came out to give me an estimate (at no cost to me), had the replacement door in no time, and Juan came out immediately to install it.  In the middle of the install, my agent called and said we had to replace the old door with one identical to the original (ie: not the one in the middle of being installed).    Needless to say, drama and a major headache ensued.  Josh helped me work out a (staggeringly fast and fair) compromise and fix.  Long story short, my ordering mistake is going to be rectified in record (again) time and in a fair manner. I cannot say enough about Josh Doughty and the way he runs his business.   Also, his technician/installer Juan is the epitome of professional, knowledgeable and methodical in his installation. Do not look elsewhere for your garage door needs!!</Text>< Rate>

This restaurant started from a food truck. Now it's found a permanent home in Pomona. Chef is taiwanese, food was mixture of asian influence, easy finger food that's gourmet. Was able to try top selling items for the last 8 years. Tasted lobster corndog, hamachi tartare taco. This was my favorite. All the sliders were great kobe beef slider, pork belly asian style slider. The meat melts in ur mouth. The fried oyster taco was interesting and different. Walnut shrimp taco was another favorite. They have spring rolls here too, will come back and try other breakfast and lunch items.<//review>

<text>Very good place to eat. It's somewhat of asian & comfort food, mixed together. It's a very hip place to eat. Very well set up and located in downtown Pomona. You spend 10-$15 to eat, unless you get soup. Everything is picture perfect food when you receive it and the taste is very good. Also, the bread pudding is amazing!<//text>< time>

<text>Went for the first time today with my mom who goes a lot! I had the lobster corn dogs they were so amazing the lobster is all tails and cooked just right! My mom had the dan dan noodles I thought they were wonderful but on the spicy side for her. She still really liked them. We also had the fried banana pudding with ice cream OMG amazing first of all I hate banana pudding but this was so wonderful I could not believe it. If you are not sure if you want to check this place out I must say go you won't regret it!<//text><Date>1552940355465</Date>< response>

Right now (Nov 2020) The Slummin' Gourmet is only open for pick-up or delivery. We've mainly had their burgers and sandwiches, and enjoyed them all immensely. Everything is cooked perfectly and full of flavor. I am really fond of their chips and their chicken club sandwich, which is the best I've had in a very long time.</Text>

Excellent food, very clean. The Kobe burger is delicious.  Menu changes regularly.  Walnut shrimp tacos, grilled chicken sandwich, salads. Great pastries and breakfast items with stumptown coffee. Vegan and vegetarian choices as well. Very friendly staff. Great addition to downtown where everyone keeps opening up Mexican food restaurants this is a nice change of pace. Closes at 3pm so breakfast and lunch only.<//Review>

Total fan of this place! The food is top notch without the crazy prices. You can definitely tell that this used to be a food truck. The flavors are on point and the turn around time is fast.
The restaurant is clean and the kitchen is open so you can watch everyone prepare your upcoming delicousness.
Side note: don't skip the bakery items.<//Text>

I had the egg muffin and it was delicious! It had applewood bacon, a fried egg, and arugula on a fresh made english style muffin. The flavor was superb. The cold brew was good, but expensive at $5 for a 16oz. with no flavor added.<//Text>

It used to be that Pomona was a place to avoid but thanks to locations like "Slummin' Gourmet" you're able to enjoy a delicious meal with the easy going environment. It's definitely worth stop and trying a few random plates.<//text>

<Text>This place was really good, but just barely missing the mark with a few things. My chicken sandwhich and my husbands shrimp tacos were great, but the chipotle maple sweet potatoes didnt even have a hint of chipotle and the better than oreo cookie was just meh. Overall I would definitely go back and would probably give 4.5 stars if i could.</Text><UserId.>113907072910965558817<//UserId.>< user_name>

This is probably my favorite restaurant in the whole city. If you don't know this restaurant you go there for Americanized tourist food. But if you know, you go there for one thing and one thing only--clay pot rice. My favorite is the one with sausages and smoked ham. And I'll tell you a secret: after you finish the rice, tell them to make a soup for you with the leftover rice stuck to the clay pot sides.
I've had same dish in China and Hong Kong and nothing compares. I've had this since the current owner's mom was making it. It's still the best I've ever had.< /Text>

<Review>Don’t waste your money. Salty food. Small portion. Low service. They also expect tips(15%). I felt as though my service wasn’t good enough for me to tip (I ALWAYS tip) the only host/waitress will demand you to pay tip. I, on the other hand felt as though $30 worth of salty food and small palm portions wasn’t worth what I paid. The host had the audacity to demand a tip so I gave her .75 cent. Her response was “Oh my god”.

I am a waitress myself and if you want good tip then you give the best service you can give, not by giving low services and demanding tip from EVERY CUSTOMER.</Review>< pictures>

Really enjoyed the food. Pork fried rice and beef chow fun were delicious and not overly greasy. Big portion sizes. I could see how people thought the waitress was rude but pretty sure she doesn't intend to be. She remembered everything we asked for and brought food out in a timely fashion. She is hustling to try to get people in, seeing as there is limited space. Could use some redecorating  but all in all I liked it.<//Text>

<Text>Guys, this is not a place for dim sum, orange chicken, spicy and sour soup.  This is a truly Cantonese Chinese restaurant; they are good at home/village food.  They don't make dim sum here.  The dim sum are brought from next door (surprise to hear it is microwave or frozen; never ever had this issue before).  What you should order here are steam live fish, clay pot rice, etc. Go with a Chinese friend.  The English level here is low, so miscommunication is bound to happen.  My parents only liked eating here and so my family eat here when we go to Chinatown; we have been coming here for over 20 years.  Never had an issue but I have witnessed frustrated customers because they did not know what to order and the waitress were awkward.  But since I understand how their body language can be misunderstood, so I understand all the negative experience as described here.  And they are extremely understaffed.  If I were you expecting spring roll and dim sum and in a rush and attentive service, don't come here.  If you are not judgmental about eating fish with a head on and don't mind the floor is sticky, and water may spilled out by accident, the food is great, if you know what to order.  $60 for 3 people is not expensive in SF.  They only accept cash.  I give a 3 star for lack of polish in service.  The food deserves a 4.<//Text><username>Alinna Lee<//username><Time>1474067212534< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I usually don’t write a review but to my experience, I felt it was important for me to give a review about Bow Hon Restaurant. Firstly, sure, this place is a great place to eat…for those people who don’t mind frozen-to-microwave food which I wasn’t expecting from this restaurant.

My friends and I decided to go there because there was an old lady giving out a sample of tasty chicken and convinced us to go into Bow Hon Restaurant. We looked at a menu and ordered some food by writing (my friends and I are Deaf). My friends and I got savory chickens and rice. I had an orange chicken but their dressing are on bottom, the size of chickens are ridiculous small.  I took a bite of it - it is bland… It doesn’t taste like fresh chicken at all. So I requested them to replace the place and they refused and augured with my friends and I. I was embarrassed by their actions. Luckily, my friend’s friend was in a town and was able to interpreter for us. He told the EXACTLY SAME THING to waitresses and guess what? They agreed with him and give us a replace plate.

WHAT IS THIS? It is not fair to us deaf people who have to deal with this craps. I personally don’t know why others people are giving this restaurant a 5 or 4 stars I’ve been to Downtown China before and I’m telling you this restaurant does not meet the standard of tasty and delicious food…I’ll not come back at all.< /Text>

Please check the bill before you pay. The waitress increases the final amount and very agressively demands the tip. The service is totally poor.<//review>

<text>Their specialty is the chicken or duck claypot rice cooked from scratch.
I had the chicken claypot rice (portion is big enough for 2) which in my opinion was very decent and well made. Chicken bits were well seasoned & savoury
The stired fried beef with kailan has the “wok-hei” and tasted really good.
Service was prompt and courteous

Be careful with what you order! Some dishes don't have prices on the menu but only tell 'seasonal'. I explicitly asked the waitress for the price of a seafood dish in advance. Food was okayish, but they charged double the price for the dish in the end! I was finally paying the money...still they approached us asking for tips when leaving, leading to another 5 minutes discussion with the staff.<//Review>

We ordered dim sum...it was a mistake. Most likely frozen and reheated. The onion pancakes were deep fried? and greasy. Service was slow. Nothing to recommend. Best avoided<//Review>

The service lady was quite unpleasant, we did not receive everything we have ordered and it was included in the final bill. At the end she insisted on the tip of at least 10 to 15 percent, not less, stating that it is the law. Have not experienced such a rude behavior anywhere else. Meals very average.<//text>

<rating>3< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) I stopped by this restaurant to taste the famous Chinese steamed dumplings.
The restaurant is spartan, but has free Wi-Fi for guests.
I liked the prawns because they are made and because they are very tasty, although I can't consider myself an expert on the subject.
I found the bill a bit saltier than expected.
The lady who served me was not the greatest sympathy, but she supported my requests to ask for the entrance door to avoid a draft.

Mi sono fermato in questo ristorante per assaggiare i famosi ravioli cinesi al vapore.
Il ristorante è spartano, ma ha il Wi-Fi gratuito per gli ospiti.
I gamberetti mi sono piaciuti perché fatti espressi e perché molto saporiti, anche se non mi posso considerare un esperto della materia.
Ho trovato il conto un po' più salato del previsto.
La signora che mi ha servito non era il massimo della simpatia, però ha assecondato le mie richieste di chiedere la porta di ingresso per evitare corrente d'aria.<//review><gmap_id>0x8085808b4dc16cb5:0x4016b58e846063fa< /gmap_id>< pictures>

Today, I am curious to explore, go to this restaurant, and order a 2.95 leek dumpling at the gate. When I received the bill, the leek dumplings became 3.95 (night market price lol). I asked the boss what the other knife was. The boss said that I watched you charge the mobile phone when you were eating dumplings. This is the electricity bill! Hahaha. The boss is talented!

(Translated by Google) We have been to so many restaurants, and we have always enjoyed ourselves. Here, on the other hand, it was the first bad experience abroad. The problem is the waitress, a rude and spoiled one. We paid the bill and the rest didn't bring it and pretended to be busy to not give it to us. When we asked the rest she became aggressive, saying that we HAD to leave everything tipped, with a tone of command and anger. Being afraid of arguing in his area, we had to give him a nice "tip" that he didn't deserve and go out. It spoiled our day.
Be careful when you pay, you must have the precise money that otherwise does not give you rest

(Original)
Siamo stati in tanti ristoranti, e ci siamo trovati sempre bene. Qui invece è stata la prima brutta esperienza all'estero. Il problema è la cameriera, una maleducata e viziata. Abbiamo pagato il conto e il resto non l'ha portato e ha fatto finta di essere impegnata per non darcelo. Quando abbiamo chiesto il resto è diventata aggressiva, dicendo che DOVEVAMO lasciare tutto di mancia, con un tono di comando e di rabbia. Avendo paura di litigare nella sua zona, abbiamo dovuto dargli una bella "mancia" che non si meritava e uscire. Ci ha rovinato la giornata.
Fate attenzione quando pagate, dovete avere i soldi precisi che altrimenti non vi dà  resto<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) On 28/06/2019 on the way back to the hotel more or less by chance came into this Chinese restaurant / bistro and it was NOT GAR! It sat many people, including Asians, in it, which made a good impression. This was from the somewhat rough service (trademark pink streak) and that other guests (also German) complained about their food, clouded. We ordered Orange Chicken twice (about $ 12). The rice you had to buy extra ($ 2 per small bowl). We had eaten orange chicken both at the "Panda Express" chain and at another Chinese restaurant in a small town after Death Valley. So we knew what to look like and taste like. Our meal arrived after 10 minutes (not a good sign). We got small pieces of chicken with a light yellow / white breading in a transparent sauce with orange slices inside. The chicken was lukewarm and tough. Acted as warmed up and thrown into the sauce. The waitress did not want to see the complaint of the food. There was a loud dispute between her and me in the small guest room, which was uncomfortable for me. In addition, she fumbled around on our plates and tasted even the chicken pieces and said that this is just "their" orange chicken. Honestly, now that she had her fingers in our food, I really did not want to eat it anymore.
I showed her pictures on the internet how to make Orange Chicken look like. Then she said that was her sesame chicken and offered to bring us this dish. However, we declined with thanks and returned our food, which was reluctantly accepted by the wait staff. When it came to paying, I should not only pay our two ice teas, but also the two bowls of rice (garnish). Sorry, but that should be a really bad joke! The rice was ok, but the main course was not edible. Should I eat the rice dry now or what ?!
In the end, I only paid for our two drinks and we disappeared quickly.
From the other guests who complained, we learned on leaving that the pork was cartilaginous and a woman got as vegetables only a few Kolhlblätter. So you should NOT EAT here on GAR!

(Original)
Sind am 28.06.2019 bei dem Weg zurück zum Hotel eher zufällig in dieses chinesische Restaurant/ Bistro gestoßen und es ging GAR NICHT! Es saßen viele Leute, auch Asiaten, drin, was erstmal einen guten Eindruck machte. Dieser wurde von der etwas ruppigen Bedienung (Markenzeichen rosa Strähne) und dass sich andere Gäste (ebenfalls Deutsche) über ihr Essen beschwerten, getrübt. Wir haben zweimal Orange Chicken bestellt (ca $ 12). Den Reis musste man extra dazu kaufen ($2 pro kleine Schüssel). Orange Chicken hatten wir bisher sowohl bei der Kette "Panda Express" als auch bei einem anderen chinesischen Restaurant in einer Kleinstadt nach dem Death Valley gegessen. Wir wusste also wie es ungefähr auszusehen und zu schmecken hat. Unser Essen kam nach 10 Minuten (kein gutes Zeichen). Wir bekamen kleine Stücken Hühnchen mit einer hellgelben/ weißen Panade in einer durchsichtigen Soße mit Orangenscheiben drin. Das Hühnchen war lauwarm und zäh. Wirkte wie aufgewärmt und in die Soße geschmissen. Die Kellnerin wollte die Reklamation des Essens nicht einsehen. Es kam zu einem lautstarken Disput zwischen ihr und mir in dem kleinen Gastraum, was mir schon unangenehm war. Zusätzlich fummelte sie im auf unseren Tellern  rum und kostete selbst die Hühnchenstücken und meinte, dass dies eben "ihr" Orange Chicken sei. Also mal ehrlich, nachdem sie nun ihre Finger in unserem Essen hatte, wollte ich das erst recht nicht mehr essen.
Ich zeigte ihr Bilder im Internet, wie Orange Chicken auszusehen habe. Darauf meinte sie, dass sei ihr Sesam Chicken und bot an, uns dieses Gericht zu bringen. Wir lehnten jedoch dankend ab und gaben unser Essen zurück, was widerwillig von der Bedienung  hingenommen wurde. Als es ums Bezahlen ging, sollte ich dann nicht nur unserer beiden Ice Tea, sondern auch die zwei Schüssel Reis (Beilage) bezahlen. Sorry, aber das sollte wohl echt ein schlechter Scherz sein! Der Reis war zwar ok, allerdings war die Hauptspeise nicht essbar. Sollte ich den Reis jetzt trocken essen oder was?!
Schlussendlich habe ich nur unsere beiden Getränke bezahlt und wir sind schnell verschwunden.
Von den anderen Gästen, die sich beschwerten, erfuhren wir beim Rausgehen, dass das Schweinefleisch knorpelige war und eine Frau als Gemüse nur ein paar Kolhlblätter bekommen hat. Also hier sollte man auf GAR KEINEN FALL ESSEN!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Insgesamt würde ich 3,5 sterne geben.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8085808b4dc16cb5:0x4016b58e846063fa<//Gmap_id></record>

I went in for a Brazilian wax and was very disappointed because there was several hairs left in different areas. I feel she wasn't careful enough or was just in a hurry.
I guess I'll stick with Montebello.<//text>

However, on 4/6, I  showed up for my confirm appointment and the site was closed. No one there and lights off. There wasn't a sign on the door explaining why it was closed. I rushed over after work and nothing. My time waisted. Why would you confirm an appointment and be closed? Why not notify those who made appointments?<//review><user_name>Vanessa Diaz<//user_name>< Rating>

Went here for the first time to get my eyebrows Arch. I got them threaded and they did a great job. The Stylist was very gentle and it was not painful. She did a very beautiful job and I'm looking perfect for my wedding tomorrow.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have been going to Zibas for almost 10 years now and they never fail to amaze me every time I go in to clean up my eyebrows. I am always satisfied with how my eyebrows turn out in the end. Not to mention, I have been going with Savita every time because in my opinion she is the best ! I love her ! She always greets me and asks me how my 2 boys are and just is very friendly.< /review>< pictures>

The lady that works on the second chair declined to do a full face on me because she said I had complained the other time to her about bleeding and she said it's normal. I only mentioned that to her no one else and I asked for tissue. Today, I went to get a full face, she said she would do my eyebrows/ upper lip, but not fullface. She said she didn't want to get in trouble. It wasn't a good experience. Not going back there again.< /Text>

I had an exceptional experience here at this Zibas! All of the staff was very professional, but Ms. April was sooo sweet, kind, and helpful she went out of her way to make me feel comfortable. I haven’t had my brows done in quite some time and was pretty nervous; all I could think about was how bad it hurt before. She assured me that her brow specialist would take good care of me which put me at ease. Sometimes just a few words of wisdom can go a long ways. She ensured everyone was being treated with respect and remained close by just to check on me afterwards. Thank you so much by far this is the best eyebrow experience I have ever had. I will definitely be returning to this Zibas from now on for recurrent brow services.< /review>

This place was terrible honestly I will never come back, the lady at the front desk doesnt even smile she said "20 minutes" I ended up waiting 45 and to top it all off my eyebrows look like rainbows. Don't goto the lady second from the back. Lesson learned👿😡<//Text>

Small space, but great service and amazing food. It was my first time trying Cuban cuisine, and now I'm sorry I didn't try it sooner! We tried the sampler platter and a couple other dishes, and everything tasted fantastic. I will be back.< /review>

Three stars because the folks running it were super polite and it's nice to get someone that genuinely cares about your order.
The yucca fries were good but I can say I wasn't a fan of the cubano or lechon sandwiches.  I guess I was spoiled having my first cubano at the #1 Cuban restaurant in Miami but this sandwich had too much mustard and the meat was soggy and for $8 didn't contain enough meat.< /Text>

<username>Mari M<//username><Time>1565586268496< /Time><rate>4<//rate><Review>Sol Cubano is like a little hole in the wall burst of flavor. It literally is the only caribbean restaurant in Sacramento. If only we had more like Miami but who am I kidding :o .. I do love the dinner plate Ropa Vieja,(shredded beef in a sauce) however, the times I've come it has tasted different each time. Some really good, some not the greatest. So I have now been ordering the Carne de Res con papa (beef chunks with potatoes) so far so good. I always order an order of Tostones (fried green plaintains) y Maduros (fried sweet plaintains)  & my dinner always ends with a Cortado ( cuban espresso) & un pastellito de guayaba (guava pastry). Being a Puerto Rican/Cuban in Sacramento is so hard because there literally are NO restaurants with our food. So when I am feeling homesick I always drop in! Give it a try! The downfall is they are ONLY OPEN 4days/wk (Wednesday-Saturday)

This place was great when they first opened. Probably the next best thing to Florida, but today when I went, everything was flavorless except for the Cuban sandwich.

The beans and rice were definitely not cooked with the bay leaves. Meat was sour and not because of the onions.

Coming from true authentic Cuban food this was a disgrace.<//review>

From the papa rellenos to the ox tail stew good stuff all around. Haven't had a dish that was bad or tasteless yet.

They have many good choices. I have tried the breakfasts, the sandwiches, the stews the pork plates and many appetizers and even the salads.

They have a great variety items so much to choose from.

Parking is pretty good. Decent amount of spots and even on the side of building too.

Inside has cuban pictures and art work all around.<//Review>< pics>

Wonderful, authentic Cuban meals. Servers are friendly. Servings could be a little larger, but for the price they are currently sold at, it is vaguely reminiscent of dining in the country of Cuba. The decorations are wonderful as well!<//Text>

Was really happy to find this place in my neighborhood. Was really sad to find that there Cubano sandwich wasn't even as good as the one from Trader Joe's that's pre-packaged. But the yucca fries were amazing and I will go back simply for yucca fries< /review>

<Review>My first time here. I order a garlic pork dish and cuban rice and a fried mashed potato ball with ground beef in it. The potato item was excellent. I really like the pork dish it was full of flavor and the meat had very little fat. I had a choice of white rice and a cup of black bean soup or the Cuban rice which is basically the two items put together. It was good but not my favorite. There was also a salad with tomato cucumber and lettuce. It had a little bit of weird dressing and I didn't like it all. There were a few other dishes that I would like to try in the future.</Review>< UserId.>

Great food my wife says the flan is made perfectly. Would be a four if the place was open more often. It seems to always be closed during it's open hours when we go.</Review>

Fast friendly service. I had a beef sandwich & rice with beans. The beef tasted old and the rice was flavorless. The restaurant is in an inconvenient location. There aren't many parking spaces and it's difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. Plus there are a lot of sketchy people who hang around that particular area.</Review>

Great customers service! Great food! Been dying to try this spot!!! Would highly recommend. Very hard to find a Cuban restaurant in Northern California. There was one in every corner in Miami where I used to stay.</Review>

<text>This place is a hidden gem, very good food at an affordable price, small restaurant and is closed at odd hours but if you get the chance to go the food will not disappoint you. I usually order the fried pork and plantains which in my opinion are the best things on the menu lol. The staff is very nice and if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them as they are very helpful.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Sol Cubano is hands down the best Cuban eaterie outside of Havana.   The owners put in the work and provide amazing food and I have yet to have a mediocre meal.  I Love Cuban food and going to Sol Cubano is a regular stop.<//text>

The oxtail had flavors, but everything else, empanada and the potatoes meatballs were dry. Tasted almost like it was left out awhile and then deep fried again. It's very dry and the empanada had a small amount of dried ground beef w barely any flavoring.<//review>

Ordered food to go. Not a fan of #20 which was simply not good, the Cuban sandwich was nicely pressed and was tasty, the shredded pork and Moro rice was good. Reminded me of Cuba, can’t wait to go back and experience the real thing.</text>

< Review>
Highly recommend getting a fresh coconut. They bring it out with a straw and after you finish drinking it they will cut it open for you to eat! I had the ropa vieja with the moros y cristianos (black beans and rice mix). I thought that the beef could have been more tender / less cooked? But the flavor was really good. Next time I hope to try the croquetas but they were out when I came. Also the plátanos maduros were really good.<//Review>

<Text>I love this Cuban place. Over only been here a couple times, but I haven't had anything I didn't love.

Their oxtail is rich and tasty, their ropa vieja is exactly how it should be and their fried pork is awesome. I definitely would go here again, and recommend!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809ad8ec0aa4d7b7:0xe0b46085e1e8314e<//Gmap_id>< time>

The staff is great, the food is amazing! Small but popular so make sure that you come hungry and have a little patients because it gets really busy. My new favorite place!< /Text>

<Text>This place never disappoints me. Even though they have a small menu, it is delicious, authentic  food. The Cuban clack rice is my favorite. Each time I go, I try a different plate to see which of the selection is my favorite. Always have Papa Relanos as a appetizer as it goes well with their own-made hot  sauce. The only down fall is the limited schedule as it is only open from Thursday to Sunday, but it is due to family issues. But it is worth waiting for.

The wife was so hesitant of trying out Cuban food as she has poor variety taste in food. But after a few minutes of convincing her with the waiter, she has been in love with Sol Cubano.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad8ec0aa4d7b7:0xe0b46085e1e8314e<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Sol Cubano has authenticity cooked dishes like oxen tail which is stewed to where the meat falls off the bone and has reduced wine sauce that just melts in your mouth. My personal favorite is the Vaca Frita which is finely shredded beef that has been fried to a slight crisp along with some red onions  topped with a little lime juice. It's truly and experience. Though I will admit some days have better food than others; there have been times where I have visited and the food was less than satisfactory but it still deserves a 5 star rating due to the price. Overall, Sol Cubano is a small "hole in the wall" type restaurant and if your aching for Cuban food this place will hit the spot.< /Review>< user_id>

My first time coming here, and the Fricase de Pollo (spelling?) with Cuban black beans and rice was incredible! Very reasonable price. I have a new hang-out now.  I'll try the oxtail next time.  Good job!< /Text>

I have had better Cuban food.  I don't usually write reviews. But I felt I needed to do it this time.
I had rabo encendido...i had never had it the way they prepared it.  A totally different sauce that seemed similar to Mexican style.  If I go to a Cuban restaurant, I want to taste cuban food.  I have had Cuban food since I was little.  I love Cuban,  but unfortunately,  this was not my favorite...
The black beans had no flavor to me.
We ordered stuffed potatoes and they could have been better.
One thing I really loved was the fresh coconut water.
Now, the service was great...i cannot complain about the service.  Our waitress was very helpful and nice.  But unfortunately,  this is not authentic Cuban food!!!</review>

<text>Food is great. Nice place inside but small. Sadly they were out of flan.
The menu has a good selection of dishes and sides. Had ropa vieja with cuban rice and the potato ball. The ropa flavor is great, the potato was great especially with the hot sauce. Happy I found this place< /text>< Pictures>

<Time>1519347343398<//Time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>Their appetizers are the reason I go here. Their tostones, mariquitas and platano frito are the perfect items for when I am craving plantain. I have tried their cuban sandwiches and ropa vieja and find the food really satisfying but feel that they are missing flavor at times.

I have never had to wait for my food and the servers are always attentive. The location is very neat and orderly and they have a wall dedicated to pictures of their customers over the years which shows how much the establishment cares about their regular and new customers. I would highly recommend this place.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I went here with the family today for lunch and it was delicious!  I had the Lechon Asado and it was so bright and flavorful.  The Cuban rice complemented everything perfectly.  We also had fried plantains and we had the Papas Rellenas, which were both delicious!  Great little place and very friendly staff.< /text>

Good service but the food is nowhere close to a Cuban food has to be. Las croquetas they were horrible small old meat tasted more like beef jerky the stuffed potato or La Papa rellena was the only food that tasted right but they were too small to be called Papa rellena. El rabo encendido overcooked overspiced very spicy and burnt The Boiled Yuca look like the boiled french fries thin and short too many shortcuts that's making the food tastes horrible I owed you to revamp your menu and to cook the food properly without burning it<//Review>

<Text>Great gym, in a number of ways. The coaches are very experienced, the workouts are dynamic and fun without compromising intensity, and the community is fantastic. I started going to this gym about 4 months ago and I enjoy it now even more than when I first started.

Overall, the amazing experience I've had at this gym cannot be overstated. I would highly recommend checking out their website and signing up to meet with one of the coaches.</Text>< date>

This review is long overdue! I've been going to IronFire Strength & Fitness  almost a year. This  place was incredibly fun and they have  amazing workout  schedule. Instructors are professional , motivate each and every one of us to work hard and push ourselves to get the most out of the workout.</text>

< Review>
Having been an athlete my entire life, but stopping partway through college like many do,  it was hard to get back into a fitness routine that gave me the same motivation and drive like sports did.

Enter Ironfire. They've managed to satisfy all my needs when it comes to training. From the intensity and diversity in programming, to the amazing coaching staff, and strong community, Ironfire has reinvigorated my love for fitness.

Hands down the strongest I have ever been!< /Review>

It is a perfect mixture of training, community, and fun! I have never looked so fit (ok well I still love ice cream) as now. I used to think I knew how to work out but I was sooooo wrong.

It seems the community of gym is very supportive of one another. I didn't make an appointment to be able to join the class that I had hoped, so that really wasn't too great. I wish that the Yelp page would have said Yes under appointment needed.< /Review>

<user_name>Santino DeWreede< /user_name><Review>So I try to drop in at CrossFit Poway, and when I was "greeted" I was asked if I could be helped as though I just took the jelly out of his donut. I informed him that I was there to do a drop in and that we are from out of town. I was harshly told that they only do appointments because they need to inform other trainers and get everything set up. Even though we let him know that we have been doing CrossFit for a while he said that we couldn't be helped. Didn't know I was wasting his time, but his short answers and negative attitude made that very evident.

yes, I arrived at 4:31pm. Wasn't trying to be late. And you were not involved in the conversation & did not hear it. Short, rude answers from someone acting holier than now is not being treated with respect. I've dropped in to many Crossfit boxes & never had to check in prior. It wasn't that we weren't allowed to drop in. It was how we were turned away.</Review><Rate>1<//Rate><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbfbbca9f9591f:0x2da7158dc8ab50e9</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've been going to IFA for over 2 years, and still love it as much as when I started. With help and programming from IFA and coaches/owners Jason and Alfia, I worked through an ACL injury, and am now stronger than before. All workouts are scalable to your ability and fitness level. But more important than even the great workouts is the community of people that work and work out here. Everyone supports, encourages, and challenges each other, regardless of skill level. They all know each other by name, you are not just another anonymous person at the gym. Love IFA!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

So, this is a long overdue review.  I started my journey at Ironfire Athletics in October of 2012 and never turned back since.  In 2012, I was in constant lower back and hip pain. Of course I was super scared too, but I was ready to try something different and was hopeful it would help with my back and hip issues.  So fast forward to December 2017…. I have accomplished many personal records (PRs), competed in a few competitions and a powerlifting competition.  All of which I never once imagined I would ever be able to do.  OH…. I can do a handstand and other movements I would have never imagined too!  If you are looking for a gym that truly cares about you, your safety, movement and your goals then IFA is the gym for you. If you are unable to do a specific movement then there is always a scaling option.  IFA is good for anyone at any age.  Both my children, ages 10 and 8 also do it and absolutely love it.  Jason and Alfia are amazing owners and coaches and know how to help you reach your goals and get you very strong.<//text>

Great gym, in a number of ways. The coaches are very experienced, the workouts are dynamic and fun without compromising intensity, and the community is fantastic. I started going to this gym about 4 months ago and I enjoy it now even more than when I first started.

Overall, the amazing experience I've had at this gym cannot be overstated. I would highly recommend checking out their website and signing up to meet with one of the coaches.<//Text>

$3,540 for 1 year is the only membership now for new members, seriously. Was a member for a year and a half.  Out of the 3 crosstraining gyms that I've been a member at this was the least fun. Nice equipment though<//review>

Having been an athlete my entire life, but stopping partway through college like many do,  it was hard to get back into a fitness routine that gave me the same motivation and drive like sports did.

Enter Ironfire. They've managed to satisfy all my needs when it comes to training. From the intensity and diversity in programming, to the amazing coaching staff, and strong community, Ironfire has reinvigorated my love for fitness.

Hands down the strongest I have ever been!<//Text>

I've been part of IFA since 2014.  The trainers provide a well-rounded program building strength, cardio, gymnastics, and flexibility into each workout.  The emphasis is on doing movements with good form and scaling the weight or movement is always an option with each workout.  The gym builds community and the owners and trainers encourage personal improvement for each athlete.   Great way to start each morning!< /text>

<review>I joined IronFire after moving to San Diego almost 3 years ago.  Having done crossfit in the past, in my neighbors garage, I felt I knew what to expect. However, the community of trainers and fellow athletes here far exceeded my expectations!  Not only do they cultivate a great peer community of support and friendly competition, but I've also learned MANY new techniques and hone countless others every week!  IronFire athletics is my fitness home, and I recommend them highly!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1517105052718, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Matt!

It seems the community of gym is very supportive of one another. I didn't make an appointment to be able to join the class that I had hoped, so that really wasn't too great. I wish that the Yelp page would have said Yes under appointment needed.< /text>

So I try to drop in at CrossFit Poway, and when I was "greeted" I was asked if I could be helped as though I just took the jelly out of his donut. I informed him that I was there to do a drop in and that we are from out of town. I was harshly told that they only do appointments because they need to inform other trainers and get everything set up. Even though we let him know that we have been doing CrossFit for a while he said that we couldn't be helped. Didn't know I was wasting his time, but his short answers and negative attitude made that very evident.

yes, I arrived at 4:31pm. Wasn't trying to be late. And you were not involved in the conversation & did not hear it. Short, rude answers from someone acting holier than now is not being treated with respect. I've dropped in to many Crossfit boxes & never had to check in prior. It wasn't that we weren't allowed to drop in. It was how we were turned away.< /Text>

I've been going to IFA for over 2 years, and still love it as much as when I started. With help and programming from IFA and coaches/owners Jason and Alfia, I worked through an ACL injury, and am now stronger than before. All workouts are scalable to your ability and fitness level. But more important than even the great workouts is the community of people that work and work out here. Everyone supports, encourages, and challenges each other, regardless of skill level. They all know each other by name, you are not just another anonymous person at the gym. Love IFA!</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>So, this is a long overdue review.  I started my journey at Ironfire Athletics in October of 2012 and never turned back since.  In 2012, I was in constant lower back and hip pain. Of course I was super scared too, but I was ready to try something different and was hopeful it would help with my back and hip issues.  So fast forward to December 2017…. I have accomplished many personal records (PRs), competed in a few competitions and a powerlifting competition.  All of which I never once imagined I would ever be able to do.  OH…. I can do a handstand and other movements I would have never imagined too!  If you are looking for a gym that truly cares about you, your safety, movement and your goals then IFA is the gym for you. If you are unable to do a specific movement then there is always a scaling option.  IFA is good for anyone at any age.  Both my children, ages 10 and 8 also do it and absolutely love it.  Jason and Alfia are amazing owners and coaches and know how to help you reach your goals and get you very strong.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1514498477339, 'text': 'Thank you, Rachele!

<review>The SSA website and phone line both say appointments can be made to come in during the pandemic if they are necessary. What they don't tell you is that those are ONLY if you are applying for a new card. Legal name and/or gender change? Tough luck.

Not only did the employee on the line misgender me multiple times, I was also told I would have to wait two weeks or more just to drop off my documents, including personal identification THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT TO HAVE MAILED BACK TO ME. It's pretty flipping NECESSARY to have my driver's license with me, guys!</review>< pics>

I applied for retirement benefit and have provided all necessary documents. The SSA website says it usually takes 2-4 weeks to process. However, my application has been more than 10 weeks and still pending!<//text>

No one pick-up the phone for more than 30 minutes hold time. Not even a hold music, not sure the phone even work, then the line just get disconnected. Most of the phone system would update you the wait time or call back option.  This is the worst customer service experience ever.<//review>

I went in without an appointment at the height of the day and was seen in one hour by an extremely kind, gentle and professional person named Rich. He got my replacement social security card ordered within two minutes and even unblocked my online account and set me up with one since the site was having issues with setting mine up. My card arrived in approximately three business days after being quote 2-3 weeks! A blessed experience and we are praying for all those that are withering and ignorant of the healing and eternal life that is in Christ Jesus that we saw in the office.<//Review>

the office and its employees seems to know what they are doing; in reality they don't, this applied to both the local and general office.
my mother passed away  late last summer of 2019; the social office took both my mother and living father from the face of this earth and consider them both dead, creating a big mess for may father, stopped his medicare and medical, i called at visited the local office in Fremont more than 7 times, every single time they take more info and told me not to worry the issue is fixed.  The medical bill kept going up. then i went to social service office and spend another day to correct the problem from that end; i was SS office  often makes these mistakes, but i was assured this time the issue has been resolved. Two weeks i receive a notice that my father was taken off the medical insurance completely. I now have to start all over again, with "ZERO" confidence the issue will be resolved. This agency deserve "ZERO" star for the stress they created for my father and my family. We are good citizens serving our country, and we deserve to be treated likewise. I hope someone higher up in this agency read and investigate these public matters and fix them.</Text>

<userid>107960768216084974821<//userid><Text>Why is there no option to give a 0 star? Because of the lady from window 1, who messed up with my last name after my marriage, I had to wait for 3 months and spent $800 for the whole process in the court to receive the order for a name change. And guess what? In 3 months she asked for my immigration document and after making the copy of it, she decided to submit for the verification of my status from the immigration office. My questions are:
1. Why didn’t she ask for the verification when she made changes for the first time? BTW, I already had my SSN card with my old name and all the info regarding my legal status in the US had to be in the system (they asked for a proof during my very first visit).
2. Why did another representative tell me that after I bring the court order of the name change, they would quickly make changes with no additional headache during my next visit and I would receive my card in 2 weeks?
3.  If the lady from the same window 1, who I saw during my third visit, found all the info in the system and had the original document from USCIS, why did she decide to make me wait from February? And again, there is no progress by now. And it’s almost June.
4.  How the hell should I live knowing that I have my SSN card with invalid name especially during the pandemic period?
5. And who will be responsible for the miscarriage that I had a month ago because of the stress that she gave me?

And the worst thing that NOONE from the Fremont office can do anything to resolve the issue that appeared by their mistake. I am broken.<//Text><response>None</response>< user_name>

Today i visited this office around 9.45am in the morning. My waiting time was about 15 mins and then i was called. The gentlemen provided the service for us was really nice and friendly. He was really calm and asked me my requirement and proceeded from there. So, within 45 mins i could complete my total requirement. It was really nice experience for me. I did not hear any rude conversations at all on this office and every body seemed to be nice.</Text>

<Text>Me and my son was just there today , we waited for almost 3 hours and when it was our time the clerk who help us in window #12 was not helpful at all , she did not even look or read what we have on file .
She just dismiss us just like that . The other clerk listen to what I have to say took the file and come back explain it to us why she can’t give us the social number at this point of time because of “locking papers “ she was polite enough but I just feel like she went and talk to the other co-worker because she asks us who was the girl who help us I did not get her name but describe her so that they will have the same answer .
The lady in window number 12 is plain rude and lazy. The world is round , you will get yours one day .

It should not have been this difficult to process a duplicate card for someone who already had a number assigned; they seemed to enjoy telling us to “come back again” - I believe there is some additional training required for your employees to minimize the number of visits needed for this very simple and straightforward request for a duplicate card</text><username>Suzette Swanson</username>< rate>

<Review>When they said something, don’t trust it, go to ssa.gov and find it yourself. Then throw the official doc to their face and let them know that they are doing things in a wrong way.

But I think I still need to be polite. So I tried to smile and said thank you. And then went out and had my stuff done in another SSA office very quick at the same day.

Still feeling sorry and disappointed because I met an unprofessional stuff</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The experience overall was as any other government office. What made my experience deplorable was the security guard. He is abnoctious, presumptuous, and loud. Not helpful at all.<//review>

<review>If you're looking for a dealership to buy a Nissan, Nissan of San Juan Capistrano is definitely the way to go. This dealer is large enough to have what you need but small enough to be personable. I tried several other dealers, (Irvine & LA) and they're just too big. Takes the fun out of buying a car. Also, Marco was nice and extremely helpful. Appreciate this dealership alot!<//review>< pics>

I spoke with David over the phone and told him what I was looking for and how much I was willing to pay. He was able to get me the best price possible! When I showed up to the dealership David was with another customer but he quickly assigned Ashton to help me out. Ashton was amazing and answered all my questions. I definitely recommend this dealership. Ask for David or Ashton!<//text>< pictures>

<review>I want to give a shout out to Nissan of San Juan Capistrano for the respect and listening to my wants and needs in the right car for me. Robin the sales girl listens to me she did not pressure me into purchasing a car I did not want she listened to what I wanted and found a 2 cars in my price range that would work good for me. Marcos the sales manager he went up and beyond to help me get financed. He listened and worked with me being I have no credit and just starting to reestablish my credit. Alex the financial guy got me the lowest interest possible with the hardest of circumstances. They have been nothing but helpful since getting my car. You want the ultimate car buying experience go and speak with them. They will treat you with the respect you deserve and truly listen to your wants and what you can afford. Thanks I love my car.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Never did come to a completely amicable conclusion here, so I will still recommend going elsewhere.

Final Update:
I received a call from Nissan Corporate this morning, and unfortunately they will not be able to help, as they will take the dealer's side on this.  The issue is, the dealer is communicating my concern to them incorrectly.  And even when I tried to explain to Nissan Corporate, they will defer to what the dealership is saying.  Oh well.  I cannot recommend anyone shop here for anything.  These situations are probably only going to resolve themselves with class action litigation.  Just Beware!

Update:
I received a call from the dealership saying that the scratches were fixed, along with the dents. The area that was scratched does look repaired. That's great. Unfortunately, the dents that they claimed were fixed are mostly fixed, except for the largest and most obvious one to see. Needless to say, I will be contacting Nissan corporate tomorrow, and likely filing a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs. Nobody should endure this type of runaround when they purchase a new car. I have not had my van for more than half of the time I've owned it over the last 3 weeks. This is just unacceptable. With that said, everyone at the dealership has been very nice, including Liza and Evan. I'm not sure who "Nathan" is, that the manager mentioned in his response to my review here.

I would stay away from here at all costs. They say one thing to your face, but they don't respect you at all. We purchased a brand new 2019 NV Passenger from them on April 21st. We purchased the perma plate option, for paint and exterior protection as well, because it's always nice to have extra coverage. Fast forward to today, and I have had the car at the dealership since Monday, waiting for the "sales team" to decide what they want to do with a bunch of dings and a couple of deep (to the metal) scratches. I don't understand why my vehicle's fate is in the hands of sales people, but it is. I will be calling corporate promptly, but I want everyone to know that you better keep your guard up here. Do not accept any of their sales tactics as truth.

I will edit this review as things progress. Currently, we are being helped by their customer loyalty team, after contacting corporate to get involved in the process. I still cannot recommend this dealership at all right now.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzV7xEUFfMgAXRaFka-_aWVJ8-rqxcWjgpPv5H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYCwWL1Bgbn_q9CSTn4iqytitv72VQD_zi5VaD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1557124350736, 'text': 'Douglas we are sorry to see that you left this review when Liza, Nathan and the crew have been working to get this all resolved.

Absolutely bar none...the worst experience I've ever had at any dealership! The salesman Matt's negative  energy about his previous employer adding extra charges at signing is exactly what was done to me by them. The got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the finance team effort and energy 👏👌🙌</Review>

I am a 55-year-old woman and I have gone to the many dealerships several times to change and buy different cars during my life!  To be honest, I did not have much faith in the promises of the sellers, I always went and unfortunately most of the time I came back because of the situation without making a deal!  But, this time I am very happy that I drove 52 miles from San Diego and came here to change my car.  The staff there were very polite, kind and helpful and helped me with a lot of patience and information and finally I was able to find the car I wanted and they also paid a good price for my car. I really thank them all.  Thank you Nissan🙏❤️🌺< /Text>

<Text>I have brought my Rogue to San Juan Capistrano Nissan for all my service.  My last visit was for oil and oil filter change. When I pulled up, Angel met me at my car and immediately started the check in process! After checking the mileage, Angel expedited the paper work and I only waited about 30 minutes! Angel is very courteous and professional! He made sure I was kept informed by visiting me in the waiting area.  Thank you Angel and thank you Nissan for taking good care of me and my cars over the past 9 years!<//Text>< Pictures>

Just had a great experience.  We leased a LEAF, and hammered out all the details through email.  Car was ready when promised.  We just went in, did a test drive, and filled out the necessary paperwork.  Quick and painless, as opposed to languishing at a dealership for hours dealing with price and other things.  Ashton really delivered for us.</Text>

Then when I tried to clean my windshield I had no liquid. Then come to find out when my car was in the shop someone changed the nob for headlights etc, so from after the shop to last night I was driving without break lights, I guess someone forgot to put the lever back I’m glad I wasn’t in an accident because ppl didn’t see me well. Also no one from the warranty place call me yet about the (break alert).</text>< pics>

Congratulations on your vehicle purchase and thank you for your kind words about Tyler  &  Aydin.'}</Resp><Review>By far THE BEST car buying experience I have had!  What began as a casual browse online, I was contacted by Tyler Sherman’s team. After a few months contemplating, I reached back out. I explained my current situation - unsure of what I can qualify for as I have run into very difficult times. (As with so many during this pandemic) Tyler was reassuring, and invited me to come and view the inventory.
After having to reschedule our appointment due to work obligations, I finally made it to the lot.
Upon arrival I was greeted warmly. I was directed to Tyler and with a calm, confident greeting I expressed again my concerns and my needs. Without any hesitation he provided a tour of the cars that fit my criteria and brilliantly provided details, facts and information on each.
Took a drive in the prospective car I was looking at and once we returned, Tyler made me feel comfortable covering the next steps. Once the application was complete, the manager Ayden introduced himself, asked a few questions and went to work to qualify. As we waited, Tyler answered all of my questions with ease. I never once felt pressured, never felt the need deposit more than I felt comfortable to or agree to higher monthly terms.
Ayden returned with my approval and negotiated the terms effortlessly, assuring that I was completely satisfied with all of the terms-which I was!
Both Tyler and Ayden went above and beyond to make me not only content but absolutely thrilled about my decision to get into a great Nissan Rogue-a killer deal at that!
Thanks guys, I really appreciate it and will return along with referring anyone looking to purchase without the cliche “sales-y” experience.

An automatic five star review for Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Thank you to my salesman Juan Torres for your kindness and undivided attention to my car buying experience. Juan answered all my questions in a very honest manner, he worked closely with Jon in finance to help me get my payments that worked within my budget. And a big shout-out to Jon in finance, even after it was all said and done and I had left the dealership Jon contacted me the next day and was able to reduce my payments.Jon contacted me again 2 days later and was still continuing to work on my loan and was able to reduce my payments even more and also reduce the length of my loan. Never ever have I been to a dealership that once I left they continued to work tirelessly on my loan to reduce payments and make life just a little bit easier during these uncertain times. Thank you again Juan Torres for being my salesman I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you Jon and the finance team for all your hard work. Stay healthy and God bless Patricia Arnold.</Text>

If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Don't ever go here. They lie to you and tell you prices and then corner you. "I'll go talk to the manager" 4 times and lied every time about what was available.  We wanted the 50 dollar promotion for the test drive and was denied. Don't ever go here.< /review>

Would not recommend shopping here.  I inquired about a used Nissan Titan Pro-4X the have on their website for the price of $37,690.  I started to negotiate price and they said that with the dealer add ons that they could not work with price on it.  They gave me a list of the add ons, I told them to remove them, they then proceeded to tell me that the advertised price does not include the dealer add ons.  They have a disclaimer on their site that the dealer can add those add ons and to them this seems fine.  To me it's a shady way of doing business, the advertise the truck for a certain price and when you arrive they give you a higher price.  They need to be upfront and list those add ons with the price they are looking to get out of it.</review>

I have been paying a $12.00 ‘rider’ insurance police on my Nissan finance. It covered little things like cracked rims and lost keys.

8 months ago, I lost one of my two keys and finally went in to replace it. Although the service tech was pleasant and verbally helpful, he had to contact the claims dept. Because it was a Saturday, he could not contact them until Monday. That was a week ago. He still has not contacted me.

He did find me in the computer files. He has my address, cell phone number (and email address, I believe).

I’m planning to call him early next week with a follow-through call. If I can’t get a new key, I will cancel this rider policy. $12 per month is $144 per year and $720 total before the car is paid off!</review>

The service department is amazing! Honest, friendly, and professional every time I get my vehicle serviced at Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Gary, Tim, and Jeffrey thoroughly inspected my vehicle and provided the necessary services to prepare me for a cross-country trip. Gary always takes great care of my vehicle; he personally checks on the service progress and gives me updates. I know I'm in great hands at Nissan of San Juan Capistrano because of Gary and the service department team!  Thanks, guys, and I'll see you next time!!</Text>

My fiancé and I met with Lana yesterday. Automatic 5-stars for her walking up to me to firmly shake my hand! We've been to a few dealerships and most times, they've blatantly ignored me...leaving me to be the one to introduce myself and shake their hand. 🙄
She was very informative and honest.
Lana and Marcos gave us some numbers without playing any games. I do hope we'll be doing business. In the meantime, I wanted to share my experience there. Wonderful customer service!<//review>

Marcos gave the best customer service I’ve ever experienced when getting a car. He gave the exact info I needed and asked for, and had everything ready for when I came into the dealership. All I had to do was sign and was on my way!  He was with another customer when I got there and apologized and said he would be ten minutes, he was back in less than five.

I stopped by Nissan of San Juan Capistrano to see what they had and what I qualified for with my not too pretty credit.  I met with Lana who was very helpful and not pushy.  We looked over the inventory and decided on just the right vehicle.   Then to Ali the finance manager that also went very smooth.  Ali was friendly and professional.  I drove away in a very nice vehicle and a fair deal for my position.  Thank you both Lana and Ali it was a pleasure doing business with you and Nissan of San Juan Capistrano.<//Review>

Not everyone is quite as candid about their situation when they come in let alone on an online review. If you scroll down you will see other reviews with Lana and Ali that are positive as well. Both of them really do step foot in this dealership and try to work hard, treat people with respect, and value the time one takes to even show up at all at our dealership. We know you have many choices for Nissan in Orange County and are glad you picked us. Lana and Ali look up the reviews all the time so they will surely see this today and will put a smile on their face! -DM'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>One of the worst experiences I’ve ever come across not only for a car dealership but customer service prospective as well. Head sales manager attempted to hit on my partner, sold us a car which in return would have received 40,000 dollars worth of interest. Rude throw out the entire process. Just a horrible experience all around. I wouldn’t recommend this location if it was the last place to buy a car.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Our experience with Nissan of San Juan has been nothing but great. From Brian Escobar in service to the mechanics to mention a few Mario & Q are always very professional.  Our prior experience with other Nissan Dealerships (Nissan of Costa Mesa) horrible, service dept not willing to help and always trying to sell unnecessary services. That is what drove us to Nissan of San Juan, excellent customer service and they don't try to sell unnecessary services.  I highly recommend Nissan of San Juan.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
I am very happy to now have a reliable, honest Nissan dealership near my home.  When I purchased my Juke, I did so from the Carson dealership which is over 50 mi away...but they promised me a good deal and delivered the best service I've ever had for a car.  I originally went to the dealership in San Juan in 2014 (they were under a different ownership at that time).  I was disappointed in their high pressure salesmen, and they actually were crooked and tryed to 'take me to the cleaners'.  My experience at Carson was a pleasant and above average experience.  I feel that way about the personnel at San Juan now, and am so happy to be able to have my car serviced close to home now.  Thank you!< /review>

I went in for an oil change and tire rotation. They held off on the rotation because they said I didn’t need it. That saved me money which is awesome. Lots of service centers try and up sell or are pushy, Nissan of San Juan Capistrano isn’t. They did a great job! Thank you!<//text>

They didn't try to sell me a vehicle that I couldn't afford and in the end there were no unexpected dealership fees or charges.

Repairs seem to be excellent. They also turned off light on dash even though there was no explanation of what that was about. Team was slow to acknowledge me when I entered for service. Then we never received a call when the work was finished. This was our first time to your location, so I did not feel welcomed and helped very well. Repair service rep has yet to report results and or concerns  They had car for a week for major repairs, it would have been nice to have more communications.<//text>

Easy to schedule maintenance and service with their user friendly online experience. Had a scheduled appointment and was assigned a random service rep., as it was my first time there, but instead of making me wait (he was tied up with another customer), Matt Barr walked up and offered to assist me so I did not have to wait. So far the experience is good...ask for Matt Barr in service,  if that dept. is what you need.<//Review>

Brian went above and beyond in assisting me with trying to get my car to work again. I have not had the greatest service since purchasing  my car in 2014.

<time>1447543625730<//time><Text>We went there this morning to buy a Honda Civic EX 2006. The manager named Karl and Kacey were so nice to us. And we finally closed the deal with a very decent car. The car itself is still very well maintained. It was cleaned up again both the exterior and the interior. Then the porter actually drove us back home as an additional service since we hadn't bought a car insurance. Overall, this is a very recommended car dealer.. Although we didn't actually buy a Nissan. :P< /Text>< name>

It’s not how a business treats you when you buy, but when you don’t buy. When a company helps to empower your decision and then respects that decision it addresses something missing from so many dealers, integrity. It’s easy to build a culture of immediate gratification, but the real value of a business isn’t the $$ they make on a deal but the loyalty they build. I don’t know what my next car purchase will be, but I will 100% visit Nissan of San Juan to start that search.< /review>

Level of service has declined since the change in ownership - came in for their oil change special when I asked for it the service tech said he was not familiars with the specials I showed him the website and said I had to have it printed - not indicated on their page asked about their free check engine light scan and said that was not to identify what if there is any issues - quiet a joke I only drive from Anaheim since this is where I got my car but last time I drive all the way done here for poor service and to be talked to in a condensing manner. He offered a free was but made it all point to tell me it would take another hour just for the wash, I passed.</text>

If anyone else has been subject to their bait and switch tactics (not honoring the internet advertised price or claiming the advertised car was already sold), please contact me at ruthperryman@gmail.com.  It's time to band together and stop this fraud in its tracks.

Another Nissan dealer just told me that they also try to charge you an additional $1500-$2000 over and above the advertised price for accessories they install.  This is also considered bait and switch so if this has happened to anyone please contact me.</Review>

< Review>
I do not know where to start.  I came in with my truck having a loud knock/clank in the undercarriage.  A friend mentioned it might be the passenger front axle.  Dealership looked at it, couldn't find the actual issue, replaced the axle anyway (after asking me if that's what I wanted them to do; I didn't know the true cause until later).

I had a friend come take a ride with me, and after 5 min, we diagnosed the issue to be the rear differential.  Gears are completely ground down.

How on earth did someone at the dealership drive this vehicle and not notice is beyond me; there were 25mi on the trip odometer when we opened up the diff cover and discovered the damaged gears.  These gears were beyond repair and were DEFINITELY that way when the truck was in the dealerships hands.

I may never take my truck to Nissan of SJC again.  I cannot be any more disappointed, and I wish there was something more I could do than just post this review.

One star because I cannot leave zero.< /Review>

<Text>I was told the car I wanted was already installed theft recovery, protection package and dealer warranty, etc. and these items cannot be removed. Okay, very good negotiator.

The funny thing is I got the exact same car(yes, same VIN) from another Nissan dealer who transfer this car from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano with 11k less out-the-door price, without those fancy options.

My lesson: Do your homework and ready to walk out.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Gary Linendoll is one of the many reasons why I always return to Weseloh Nissan.  He is extremely attentive and friendly.  His assessment of the needed repair or service have always been right on.  Unlike other garages, Gary never tries to push for any unnecessary services.  I appreciate his honesty and professionalism.   Oh yes, the waiting area is very nice and helps making time pass especially during some of the longer waits.< /review><user_id>112745740167462617296< /user_id>< Pics>

<Review>I have been in the auto industry for over 30 years. My family and friends usually call me to assist them when going to a dealership for a new car. My wife researched a deal for a CPR car and chose a vehicle with Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Her sales agent was Lana Fallah (please forgive the incorrect spelling).  She gave my wife trade in value numbers and what they would offer her on the 2018 Nissan Rouge. I meet my wife at the dealership, reviewed the paperwork, and was pleasantly surprised. The numbers were clean. The offer was great. The vehicle condition and financing were perfect. I didn't have to haggle to beat the price down on the front end. Above that, Lana was great. She was straight forward, professional, caring, and respectful. So much so that I told the sales manager that my next Nissan would come from his dealership. When we got to the finance manager, Ali Fallah he didn't try to upsell to bring the price up. He showed my wife what he believed was necessary and what she was getting. There were no games, no ploys, and no tactics. Excellent service, great information Ali explained everything. This experience is how sales should be conducted and how consumers should feel. Thank you Lana & Ali Fallah. Thank you Nissan of San Juan Capistrano.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

He really was very helpful in answering all my questions over the phone and in email before I even came into the dealership. Once I was there, he again answered all my questions and was very honest about things he didnt know but got the right people to answer those questions. Truly a great buying experience from him and the rest of the staff at Weseloh. I even traded in my car and got a good deal for it.

Beware beware beware when you sign your car contract with them: They charged us (my mother and I) $995.00 for GAP insurance, they also told us that our credit union wouldn't go over 60 month payments on our new car. (That was a lie). We refinanced right away with our credit union, they charge $299. For GAP. I'm not sure what the average cost is for GAP but to charge that much more is a rip off to me. Now let's add more proof of WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AT NISSAN. DAMIEN their finance manager and Jonathan (their former sales manager) were in it together and illegally changed our contact. I actually have both contracts to prove the fraud. They are crooks and should be audited.<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1541726378214, 'text': 'Sandra we wanted to let you know that we hear you and wanted to explain that GAP insurance can vary depending on who is offering it. We go through a different company that charges different fees and has different requirements. Your personal relationship with the credit union and the history doing business with them puts you in a special place. That special place most individuals would not get including longer financing time tables and lower costs for insurance through their brokers.

I drove 1-1/2 hours from San Diego, only to be shocked that the price they promised on the phone and written via email was a total disinformation. The sales lady on the phone sounded polite and courteous and she confirmed both via phone and in writing that their advertised price was valid  for my case and I specifically asked if there were any hidden charges and surprises, and she strongly advised no. But when I got there, they just said she was wrong.< /Review>

To be honest and not try to diagnose a problem without checking first... btw the dealer respond back to this comment saying this “We have to trouble shoot first in order to give a customer all the information they need to decide if they want us to continue on the repair. Depending on the issue with the vehicle if we did not fully trouble shoot and you drove away with the issue it could cause more damage. ”.  but sorry to still complaining but actually you guys didn’t do this at this first time they let me go without giving me a solution, saying I’m
Going to check this lady and you can go home and we will notify you, I have to ask before they checked me out what was wrong and they have to go and ask the mechanic... so pls stop responding because I have prove that you guys didn’t do a good job.... so they said I’m contradicting myself haha so that o why the dealer contacted me and apologize for not doing a good job you probably contradicting yourself for not having all the problem documented in... Nissan of Tustin did a better job diagnosis and fixed my problem.<//review>

< Review>
Readers, I'm not sure how to rate this dealership yet, but I will update this and other social network reviews as time progresses. The experience my wife and I had 2 weeks ago in leasing a 2015 Nissan Rogue at Imperio Nissan was great. The salesman (Roy Sudip) and his boss were both friendly and helpful in working out a deal, and we love the car so far. The problem I have is with the cash back involved. The deal called for Imperio to send me a check for $1,000 as part of my trade-in, and to date that has just not happened. I have sent e-mails to Mr. Sudip twice on this matter. He responded on the first, but is no longer responding to my inquiries, leading me to believe I may have to take other actions.

As I said, I will update this as time progresses, and let everyone know the outcome. If this becomes a legal problem (hopefully not, but I'm losing hope), I certainly wouldn't want other customers to have this problem. To be fair, if Imperio resolves the problem, I will certainly revise all social media posts to reflect that and an improved rating. BTW, I have the promise of this payment in writing from Imperio; I'm not making this up.

Sincerely, Dr. Kevin Buck</Review>

Worst car buying experience I’ve ever had. I purchased a vehicle and it took them over 2 months to register the vehicle in my name as well complete and submit all paperwork for the car. Every time I called I either didn’t get an answer or they just didn’t give me the information I needed and left me wondering when I was going to get what I needed. 3 months later I got what I needed. Not good business. Totally unacceptable. The manager was pretty pushy as well. This is only my experience however I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened in the future.</Review>

Rob Chianese helped make my experience at Weseloh Nissan. A great person who made every part of car buying easier and more enjoyable. He aided me in getting my first car and made it a great life time memory!< /Review>

Their online prices are FALSE, advertised prices are FALSE, phone prices are FALSE and emailed prices are all FALSE. Their call center people are very polite but once you get there, you'll get the real deal!
I believe most posters with 5 stars are employees or family/friends of employees trying to jack up their rating FALSELY as they lower prices FALSELY.<//review>

<review>If I could give a Zero, I would. I was treated like dirt. Showed up for an appointment and Ariana easy even there. So, I talked with the 4th person to help me. I was home and he said he would call me back after he checked on prices. Not only did he never call me back, but the next day A friend of mine who worked for Nissan called to find out what was happening and he was told about the customer relations person that she would look into it and give me a call. She never called me back either and when my friend called she said she passed it on to someone else and I should be receiving a call. 2 Days Later I did get a call asking me what my decision was and when was I coming back to choose a car. I went to Nissan in Tustin California, and they rolled out the red carpet for me they do nothing about my horrible experience with Capo dealership, and they were the kindest nicest most thorough people I've ever worked with. I didn't have time to go over my car when I pick it up so one of the salesman called me to ask when I wanted to come in to learn about all the features. they reached out to me and didn't have to. When I brought it in I was helping mediately even though it was a Saturday they were swamped. I'd only had the car for 3 days and they even rewashed it for me if you want great service and a great car, go to Nissan in Tustin and avoid Nissan Capistrano like the plague!<//review></record>

I got totally taken to the cleaners by this auto dealer.  Our lease was up on a  2013 Nissan Altima and we brought it into Nissan San Juan Capistrano.  We decided we wanted to buy it.  If I hadn't wanted the car so much I wouldn't have paid the price but they kept telling me it was the lowest they could go.  Now a few months later I have to sell the car and I will loose $2500 on the price I can get for the car now compared to what I had to pay for it.  Steer clear of this auto dealer!!</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Horrible customer service! Employees walk by as if there aren’t any customers waiting there, and with no offer of assistance unless you chase them down as they go to make a cup of coffee. Evan was particularly rude and should not work in the service industry. I asked him a simple question and he responded with an unprofessional attitude that was unnecessary. I should have been the one with the attitude since I was waiting 30 mins past my appointment time and I arrived early.

5/7/18
I inquired into leasing for credit challenged customers online.  I was bombarded by calls from Nissan of SJC to come in as they specialize in that type of auto transaction.  I was pleased when they approved me and provided a lease contract to drive the car off the lot. The rate was very high, but I know my credit justifies paying a premium.

5/14/18
Here’s where the lack of experience and hard selling kicks in. I received a call a week after I took possession of the vehicle telling me that Nissan declined my application (I’m not in the “misleading my car purchaser” business) but I do know that responsible/ethical finance managers provide their lenders a complete application with support for a final approval before they execute a binding contract and send their customer off the lot. NOT THE CASE!  I listened to the bad news and was told they had alternative financing lined up. I was told that they have an approval with worse terms, but it was a done deal. Having spent 20 years in finance, I learned that resolving a problem was more productive than focusing on who caused the problem. I agreed to the terms and quickly drove back to the dealership to sign the new contract. Upon reviewing the contract, I realized the rate was 2% higher than I was quoted an hour earlier when they broke the bad news. I realized this outfit was no less crooked than the slimy car salesman up and down Harbor Blvd.  knowing I was had, I signed the new “binding” contract and vowed to do more research next time!  Sit tight....it get’s worse!

6/12/18
I received a call that I needed a co-signer. I laughed a bit as it was a month after they bait and switched me into the higher rate loan.  I listened to their explanation and offered to provide a larger down payment. It was a Sunday and I was told they may not have a solution until Monday. Several days passed and I received a call asking for a co-signer again.  That said...I don’t think my offer to increase the down payment was considered or noted in their system?  For the 3 weeks after I signed the 2nd contract, I received multiple declination letters in the mail from banks. I didn’t think much about it because I had finalized the car purchase. Although they were submitting my application to a plethora of banks, they never asked for my approval to run my credit over and over, nor the fact that this deal was not finalized. My credit scores plummeted and I received notification from one of my current credit card companies that my account with them was terminated due to the decline in my credit scores (I wouldn’t have known of the massive inquiries had it not been for my creditor calling me to tell me my credit line was closed).

PLEASE know this is the culture at Nissan of SJC. Review your contract, look for misrepresentations and don’t be afraid to walk from the deal. There are many other Nissan dealerships close by......I can’t imagine they all conduct business this irresponsibly!<//text>< rate>

I cannot believe this place. I called ahead to ask about getting two recalls on my car fixed, they searched my VIN and told me what the recalls were and that I could come in at any time to get it fixed. I showed up the next day on Friday and after 3 hours, they tell me I have to come back to get one recall fixed. They already ordered a special part and it will be there by Tuesday. I waited until Thursday for a phone call, didnt get one, so I called them. No one would answer on the service team so I kept being rerouted to a receptionist asking where she could transfer my call. Then. I found a direct number, called them, and they said the part was on back order and they might have it in on Monday. Then sounded irritated when he said "We will call you, don't worry about calling us". So, they call me that following Tuesday, they say it is ready, I show up Wednesday and they fix the recall. They hand me a receipt and I say "do i just show this to the dmv, then?" They said "YES". I go to the dmv to renew my registration and get told I need an orange slip, all dealerships know that, so now I am playing phone tag again and no one is answering. I am in Oceanside, 45 minutes, away and all I want to know is if they can email or fax it instead of me going to them a 3rd time.. This is the worst service I have ever received and I am beyond annoyed with them.< /Review>

I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle here. Once they make the sale the customer service in the sales department is nonexistent. They pass you around from person to person and can never give you a straight answer. They never call back when they say they will. This is the worst place to purchase a vehicle.<//text>

I come to Weseloh Nissan to get my 2011 Juke serviced. For this particular visit, I dropped in to get a part number. Someone hit my car and took off; fortunately, all that was done was that the fender flare had been torn off. My son works in the industry, so he was going to order the part through his work and put it on my car.

I usually deal with Dustin, Sabina and Gary Linendoll. Gary was gone that day, but John Arnold was very friendly and helpful, as well as Dustin and Sabina. As it turned out, Weseloh had the part in stock! I got my son on the phone, figured how much he could get the part for, and decided to get it at Weseloh for convenience sake. The tech assigned to the job even put it on for free! Everyone from Parts to Service could not have been more friendly or helpful with my need.</review>

<text>Buyers beware....if you have your own pre-approved financing for a lease buyout, don't go here! They will give you the runaround for a week, and give false purchase payoff information directly to your lender, then receive the check via FedEx, take the check to another dealership they manage (Irvine), and you will have to track it down because they didn't disclose, and will refuse to disclose all applicable taxes, title / registration costs, purchase option fees, etc.  in order for you to complete the vehicle purchase and take ownership of the leased vehicle. In their actions (which they will later justify when you complain), they will sit on your lender's check that they received from your lender, allowing you to incur finance charges, loan closing costs, etc., and there is no accountability for their sales persons mistakes. My husband actually had to go in person to get the check back from the dealership, and was then told upon arrival that the GM was in possession of the check at the Nissan of Irvine location (which he also manages). This was after the GM already knew of the escalated issue after being notified directly by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp and me personally....

This dealership pushes the purchase option contracts, so that they can use their dealership financing (which they won't fully explain to you why because they think you don't know what they are doing). They did this with me multiple times in one day, and then on later days, even after I told them I just needed the dollar amount they needed for the purchase because I had my own financing. They think with this option, that since you have the 10 day window to then get them the payment for the vehicle, it shouldn't be an issue. When in reality, it's an extra step and unnecessary when you can just get them a check, in the amount that they need from your lender that same day so that you facilitate the purchase. The GM will tell you that you need to provide your social security number for identity purposes to complete the purchase, even if you have the payment in hand. After this incident, I checked with the DMV on the title and registration process along with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp, and there is no need for you to provide your social security number to facilitate the purchase when you have your own financing….

The whole situation was very odd and a complete waste of my time that I can never get back. Save yourself the headaches and stress and go somewhere that is fair and honest, and provides full disclosures for such a large purchase. A dealership that doesn’t discriminate when you have your own financing, or intentionally make the purchase process difficult because they are making no profit in the lease buyout transaction. Sales managers that can talk and treat you with respect, and not refuse to calculate additional purchase costs to complete the transaction at hand. A dealership with a GM that actually helps to resolve the escalated issue, with a definite solution and immediate course of action when an issue escalates to his level and when there have been so many negligent actions by his management and sales staff during your transaction request. My requested lease buyout transaction should have been very straight forward, but they over complicated it to the maximum extent, and I lost money in the process. After multiple trips, I'm just thankful we were able to get the check back from them....

In reading further reviews and doing additional research on this dealership, I see that this is not the first time there has been an issue with them placing road blocks for this type of lease buyout transaction. This dealership is under new ownership and name, with the DBA being filed in March 2017. What happened here is not okay and has been escalated to the highest level with multiple reporting bureau’s to prevent anyone else from going through this.<//text><gmapID>0x80dcf1a519707de1:0xda7aabd62323ec94<//gmapID><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

I had the pleasure of purchasing a used vehicle from Rob Chianese at Weseloh Nissan.  I had two recent experiences with dealers that were so discouraging I nearly gave up on finding a new vehicle.  Then I called Rob.  He was not only respectful of my budget, but of my time.  He never tried to push me beyond my means and had everything ready for me when I arrived at the dealership.  I loved the car and was out of there in 2 hours and actually enjoyed my visit.  Thank you Rob and your management for making this experience so positive and reminding me that not all car salesman are out to dupe you.  I highly recommend the Weseloh group and Rob Chianese.  Very professional, thorough and respectful.</Text>

Just bought 2018 nissan rogue SV (feb 26 2018). But when i went home just got the car the same day i noticed the other key fob doesn't working. I sent email or send message on the contact web but no answer. I called them they put me on hold then they hang up the call. I called again they said they will notify jake and jake should call me (thats what they said). But i didn't get any call back. I called my sales broker because i made my deal with them (car specs). They said i can change the battery by my self. I did that but still the key fob didn't work after i put new battery. To many hassel for brand new car. This is Nightmare for me. And worst experience.< /review>

There was only one red stick shift Xterra within 75 miles when I was ready to buy, but when I showed up I still got a very fair price without haggling.  The finance process was clean and no hassle (especially compared to other experiences where I've had to walk out) and I managed to leave with a good deal on my car in 2 hours start to finish.

I normally think people that only take 2 hours to buy a car are getting ripped off (my last purchase took 2 weeks and 8 dealer visits to get my price), but they proved me wrong.  I did my research before I went and they came in just $300 (1%) over my target price right away (more than 10% lower than sticker).  I chose not to haggle for the extra price, but it's always nice to know that we're starting from a very reasonable number from the beginning.

I highly recommend the fair and friendly buying process at Weseloh Nissan!< /review>< userid>

They damaged our cargo van
We sent our company cargo van Nissan NV
To Nissan of San Juan Capistrano 33633 CaminoCapistrano, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 On August 12th 2017 around
9:30am To fix a suspension manufacture defect , Brian from Service department called me around 4:30 to inform me that the service is done but there is an accident happened to my Van I went back to pick up my company Van and Brian and his manager Hernandez showed me a strong damage to the side of my van , and they explained that the service mechanic was testing my van and he hit my van to the wall and damaged the driver back side of the van , Brian and his manager offered me to fix the damage but they have to take the company van for about 9 business days to be fixed
> They offered me an open  truck or small van during the period of fixing my van but we are a heating and air conditioning company,so the rental van has to be same size as our van
I took our van to a three different collision centers for an estimate price to fix my van is
$5000 and it will take 15 business day to fix plus the company logo will cost $1400 plus the resale depreciation value of the van
plus renting a cargo van for three weeks $1500 I talked to Hernandez the service manager about His options to us , he said his collision center will take 9 business days to fix the van and they will charge him $300 to fix everything on the van , and Hernandz is willing to pay me $300. It is ridiculous that big of a difference
between his cost to fix and the other body shop cost.
> How can I trust Imperio Nissan to fix my van for $300
My van is 2014 cargo van has 32000 miles since day one the van has a lot of manufacture Defects, starts with the back up camera was defected also
> the van battery was defected and the front suspension was defected,also the  USB is defected and they can't fix it until now
I'm taking them to the court ,

Rob Chianese is the man!  He and all the other associates made this a process that is not nearly as scary as I thought it would be.  They helped get me financing that was better than my bank or anywhere else I looked.  My 2011 Nissan Versa Hatchback feels so reliable and safe - I love my Nissan!  Thank you Wessloh Nissan and Rob :)<//review>

I purchased 3 new vehicles from this location and for my last Nissan Murano the CVT transmission started to show failures, I took the car to the service while in the manufacturer warranty and they told me nothing was wrong with it or at least they can't read anything (after charging me for the computer reading etc..). After another 500 miles I took the car back for another review as the problem was getting worse and then of course this time they found the problem and then just to be told that I'm out of warranty now being at 61000 miles and there is nothing they can do about it. This after I've being a loyal customer and servicing my car at their location.

(Update 09/09/2016)
My experience gets even better as I took my car to a local mechanic who found a problem with a defective tube that was providing air to the engine. This piece was replaced with under $200 and all seems good with my car now where the Nissan certified professionals from this location quoted me a full replacement of the CVT transmission for 5K.
I can't imagine how these people can still be in business to rip off people that have no idea whats happening with their cars. Lesson learned and good luck to those who dare to use their services.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My mom and I made an online appointment to test drive a used Hybrid Altima. We were greeted right away by a tall light haired older gentleman at the parking lot and asked if he could be of help. It was nice and friendly welcome. He directed us to Washington who he thought was the right person we were looking for. That was very helpful of him to do that. Washington was very professional and quick to get the keys for us to test drive. He showed us 3 other cars very patiently told us their differences and features. He was knowledgeable about the Nissans and Kia Optima.  I liked the 2010 Nissan Altima and decided to make an offer. The application process for financing was easy.  I did not get the deal I hoped for but $14/month more than my target. Signing the papers was fast after that. This car was for my son, he said it was a nice experience, I would go there again to buy another car someday.</Text>

An honest review means a lot to me and I think it helps any business or organization to achieve it ultimate goal. Also from the customer perspective, a review helps others to understand what they are likely to expect. Here is my review for Ocean Nissan based on my recent business with them

Sales Department
----------------

1. No one was pushy (A typical sales style that possibly most hate).

2. Right from the moment you park your car and step in, people are happy to see you and willing  to help you. Always expect a big smile from most of them.

3. Hooman Keyvan is an amazing person and man who sticks to his words.. Always a winner for me in any profession. If you want your next Nissan talk to him. A genuine person.

4. The Sales Management team is very good and would tell you what they can and what they cannot do.

Service Department
------------------

1. The service department was responsible for applying the Enviroguard and they took some time as a loaner was available.

2. They service quality was good and I am hoping to get outstanding service as I step in to get my servicing in the future done.

3. I wish they have more loaner, so that customers donot need to wait for longer to get their work done.

Dealership
-------------

1. Clean and nice ambiance.

2. I heard that the owners visit it regularly and that I am sure shows their passion in the business.

3. Good selection of vehicles to choose from.

4. Car Doc and Enviroguard are good options that not many dealerships provide.

5. They want new and existing customers to come to them and that tell me that they take pride in their service and customer.

6. Personally would have loved to see some more tea options in the waiting area.:)

Hope what I have written helps others and hope the dealership and its people exceed my expectations all the time.<//Review>

I recently bought a "cream puff" of a Honda CRV-EXL (07) and dealt with Rob Chianese, the salesman. He did a terrific job, encouraged me to make the 40 mi drive down from Long Beach to see this CRV after I inquired on an internet search. EVERYthing he told me about the SUV was right on target. It was a beauty, and even though hi mileage, he worked a deal for me that included assurances (a drive train warranty - in writing!) even though it was advertised (quite appropriately) "as is".  Rob was a straight talker, no pressure, guy, and made the difference in getting me into the car that I love, in just a couple hours - test drive, lots of questions, dealing with my car insurance, etc. Oh, and thanks to his excellent deal, they threw in tax and title at the price I could afford. Amazing.  I didn't think they could or would do it at my low price offer. They found a way. So I highly recommend Rob and the dealership. If you go see him, I think you'll agree.   -    John E.

< Review>
This is my second purchase from this Dealer and both times I was VERY pleased.  I bought a pre-owned Kia Soul a year ago and traded it in yesterday for a Nissan Juke!  It was a pleasurable experience all around.  David Martinez is an excellent &quot;specialist&quot;.  He knew his product and he made me feel comfortable and I felt that he was truly there to help me make the best deal.  I wanted to keep my same car payment on the new Nissan Juke as I had on the pre-owned Kia Soul and I guess that was rather unreasonable of me.  After the back and forth between David and Bill Taylor, I was pleased with the offer and I'm only paying $95.00 more per month for a brand new vehicle!!  Weseloh Nissan makes buying a car a great experience!  They even gave me a sandwich when I said I was hungry!  I would recommend this Dealer to everyone who wants a good deal and a extra friendly experience!</Review>

If you don't have a personal service manager for your vehicle that you trust 100%, I would like to introduce you to you Sabina Heineman. She is THE most trustworthy service manager in the industry. She makes recommendations for her customers as if their vehicle were her own, never recommends unnecessary services, and is honest and thorough, every detail is taken care of. She is friendly, sincere, asks about our other family members (remembers everyone's names!) and is simply a good person that looks out for your best interest. You will never feel like she's trying to "sell" you something, you will feel like she's making sure everything is taken care of as quickly, inexpensively and thoroughly as possible. She applies any discounts available, without you having to ask, offers a shuttle or free rental car services (the rental car counter is literally a few feet from her desk, how convenient!) for major services to your vehicle so you're not out for a day or having to arrange for someone to drop you off/come pick you up, and keeps you up to date if there is a new findings with your vehicle during servicing (I recommend replacing this - our technician found that it is damaged/needs replacing.) I LOVE that she simply says "I recommend" rather than "do you want us to" - I have no idea what a car needs, and when other dealers ask you if you want to pay for something, you feel like they are trying to make an extra buck, while Sabina tells it to you like it is. She serviced my previous Nissan (1991 Hardbody) when it was 18 years old, and told me truthfully "this is damaged, but replacing it will cost (X amount) and nothing bad will happen if you wait in it or just ignore it - it will just make noise" - then left it up to me. She saved me $1800 for a service I would have done with another dealer worried my truck would fall apart if I did not replace the part. Honesty, integrity, and sincerity - Sabina is the best. We take our 370Z to her to be pampered, and after being disappointed by countless other dealerships servicing my Toyota truck (literally 4 other Toyota dealerships who tried to sell me services that the next one said were unnecessary, and having repairs cost way more than quoted without any communication from my service manager there, the leaving me with a feeling of distrust), I began taking my TOYOTA to Sabina at Weseloh Nissan. She said they will service ALL makes and models!! She took extra time to call the Toyota dealership, make sure she had all the info as to what services were factory recommended for my milage and vehicle use (we use 4WD a lot in Big Bear and Mammoth (yay!), then made sure they had all the specific  tools to service my specific model, then even went down the street to Toyota for the parts they needed without a markup! Awesome! In summary, Sabina is the best, you will love her, appreciate her, and be surprised that you finally found a services manager you really trust. Thanks, Sabina!!</Text>

<Review>Horrible service.

I call to schedule a service and I am told to show up the coming Saturday before 2.00pm, and I am scheduled for 2.00pm. I do that: the coming Saturday I drive 45 minutes to get there and the service guy says there there is no service scheduled for me, that service is going to close soon and all I can do is leave.

Clearly the guy could not care less.

It's the second time in 1 year that these guys do something like this to me: obviously they will never see me or any of my friends again.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1516602226532, 'text': 'We are sorry that you had a poor experience with the previous ownership of this dealership.
