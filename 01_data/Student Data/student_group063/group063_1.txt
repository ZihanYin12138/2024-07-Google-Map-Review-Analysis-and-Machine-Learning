<Text>Incredible place. My taste buds are SO satisfied!! I have been to many sushi bars in & around San Diego & then some but these guys killed it on the presentation & there was a way better taste on the classics. The service was beyond amazing as well. Hannah greeted us right away & served each dish in an appropriate manner, I can really appreacite that in a waitress. If this place could have more stars I would give it. We will be back! & more often. Thank you!!</Text>< Pictures>

This is the best food joint in Ramona!! Hands down some of the best food. they cover every need, from deli sandwiches and burgers for a quick lunch bite, to all things sushi. And Mr. Tuna(Ken)cuts sushi like no other! His dishes look like what you see on a TV show! Sam my waiter was amazing! My drinks never hit the bottom! Everyone here is just cool. Even the cook Hoss has a bomb burger on the menu. They make the vibe here perfect! This pick is the "big O fish" sandwich! Ahi tuna with soft shell crab! It is a must try! From bomb beer selections to sake and wine. What are you waiting for? Go!!!< /text>

Wow. We heard a lot of good things about this place, and finally broke down and and came in. Really, truly impressed. Even Wolfie like it. It is really hard to impress a picky, 8-year-old.</Review>

<Text>Wasa has re-opened under new ownership. The sushi is great, the fish is fresh and delivered daily in the morning, and many of the sauces are made from scratch.  The fish is fresh and flavorful, the rice is perfectly cooked for sushi, and overall the place is great.  It's a much needed break from the all the taco shops, fast food and diner style restaurants in town. Definitely recommend this to anyone that appreciates sush. I also added a picture of their current menu.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Excellent food, exceptional service by Hannah.  We're glad to have a local sushi restaurant here in Ramona.

Edit:  I've been thinking about our experiance today, and I admire the tenacity to have a soft open during the covid pandemic.  Our food today was excellent, and service was impeccable.  Our server Hannah was attentive and cordial.  The new owner was present and keen to see that we had a great experiance.

We're glad to have good sushi restaurant in Ramoma, and wish them the best.< /Text>< pics>

I have to shout out to SHELBY the sushi roller the past 3 times I've gone. THANK YOU for letting me customize my rolls. She smiles and greats us when we  come thru the door (me plus my 4 year old) picking up to go order. I feel like it's a touch pricey but a great deal during happy hour times for discount.maybe be they will add a locals discount dor people who walk to get their food to go :) I'm not sure if all servers are aware of happy hour deals... BUT REGARDLESS I am so happy to see this place back open!  Please keep the doors open!</text>< pictures>

If Hells Kitchen is your idea of a night out this is the place. 100 degrees or hotter inside. Sushi was warm almost hot. Katsu chicken burnt. Cucumbers warm. This is the worst food we have ever had, ever. None of us ate our food... We considered telling the employees but if they truly cared at all they would not have served this slop. Absolutely the worst. We really should have known with only 1 other table occupied on a Saturday  night. Gross. Never again.<//text>

< review>
Service was great very friendly staff. I tried the calamari which was amazing. Unfortunately, this was some of the worst sushi I've ever had. My roll had so much eel sauce that the integrity of the entire roll was compromised. The roll was falling apart because of how soggy the rice was from the sauce. It was very price for a roll I ended up throwing away.<//review>

Food is yummy (and pricey) but the new ownership is disappointing. Menu is almost exactly the same. Wait staff stood around chatting instead of attending to tables. Took almost 30 minutes to get our appetizer. I know this was completely out of their control but someone from the smoke shop a few suites down was smoking and the smell permeated the restaurant for a good 15 minutes which was nasty.</review>

<Review>I reccomend this resturaunt. The food was wonderful and the portions are very large. The quality of the fish was extremely good for an inland resturaunt. Meals are on average $12 per-person which was very fair becuase we both had leftovers.</Review>< pictures>

My daughter has gone twice and nothing was done. The second time she could not breathe and they did not give her oxygen or anything. We went to the pharmacy to get the medicine over an hour later, and nothing had been submitted. Tried to call and there was no answer. Completely Done. I can't wait until October so I can switch insurance!!< /review>

s nice to everyone who comes to the door.  The doctor, who said his name sounds like Corona, was very knowledgeable.  He explained all my x-rays to me and I was very comfortable talking to him. He has excellent bed-side manner.  The x-ray technician John was very professional and gentle. I could tell he really knew what he was doing.  The office staff is very nice.  This will be my first choice if I need to go to urgent care again even though I'm a bit far from it.  Thank you Saint Mary's Urgent Care Apple Valley.  I appreciate everything you did for me today.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I am very disappointed in this place!
I went to urgent care on Friday and today is Sunday and still haven’t got my medicine. Called urgent care a few times only was able to get through twice and was told that they would fax it over never did get to the pharmacy. Then decided to go back to urgent to see what was going on and was told that they would fax it over and to go back to the pharmacy. So I go and nothing yet. So two days after I have no meds yet! In pain. Very very disappointed!<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>I brought my son there with a sprung ankle the size of a tennis ball. He waited for 2 and half hours to be told to go Victorville urgent care  for xray or come back Tommorrow even though they do xray here no explanation
After sitting in a room in extreme pain hearing ppl laugh and talk. To be barely examined and having to walk back to car. No one offered him assistance like a wheelchair  to get back to care. I was told I had to wait in car upon arrival because he was 18. Horrible service I must say put yourself in the shoes of a patient that is in pain. You should go over and beyond to make that person comfortable.  After getting xray at Victorville urgent care no call on results I had to call for almost 2 days to get results. Its should not be acceptable when ppl fail to do there jobs. I should of just went to emergency room.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3630ed426c049:0x725a498dfd1e81a5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's $130 to see the doctor for less than 5 minutes, they refuse to let anyone but the patient in (even if the patient needs your help), and the doctor just prescribed antibiotics and said "come back in 2 days if it's worse". 2 days later, I'm now at the hospital because the other urgent care said it was "too bad for them to handle", and we were previously told to wait. What a joke of a "doctor" this place employs. Go to Meridian, or anywhere else. They don't want to help you, just to take your money.</Text>

<Text>Had a great experience the first time i went a couple months ago for a bad cough, went back for a sprained foot this week and I was in and out, the Nurse practitioner looked clueless how to treat me. And prescribed me some Ibuprofen, but never called in the prescription. Now 3 days later i still cant get someone to answer the phone to see whats going on with my meds.<//Text>< pictures>

Rude and unprofessional office. They made me wait for over an hour to be seen then to just tell me that they weren’t going to see me because they didn’t want to treat a work injury. They abandoned a patient in need.and their office manager does not even know their protocol! She checked me in I told her I was hurt at work, she made me wait an hour just to have nurse tell me they can’t see me and that the office manager could explain it all !!! Why did she not tell  me at check in they would not see me?!?   Again unprofessional and unorganized. They need better management.</review>

Brand new facility. No waiting time. All immaculate and clean. Quick and easy to get in and seen. The staff are really pleasant and treat you well. If you want to get fast treatment in a modern place then this is the place to go. It’s located just past the hospital- drive past the ER entrance to the parking lot at the end.

<text>I went in around 9/10 am for a large open puncture wound on my calf, and this place is by far the best medical services I've received in my 20 years living up here! The wait was Hardly nothing and the doctor who saw me was totally amazing! Friendly, professional, and very thorough. He actually took the time to explain to me everything and anything I was concerned about. Unlike most doctors whom don't even stay in the room long enough to hear what you have to say and are just quickto pull out their prescription pads and hurry you out the door. Anyway. Great service and doctor! 10 stars!</text>< gmap_id>

<gmapID>0x80c3630ed426c049:0x725a498dfd1e81a5< /gmapID><Text>took my daughter this morning, it wasn't a bad experience. I've gone to urgent cares where they act like they have better things to do with their time, i did not get that feeling from the staff here. The woman at the front desk was very thorough and friendly, had us checked in within a couple of minutes, our wait time wasn't too bad. The nurse who took her vitals was very sweet and friendly, my daughter loved her! and the doctor who saw us was very professional and friendly. He took a moment to shake my hand and introduce himself as if we were to be friends. He didn't seem judgmental or rude, nor did he seem to rush us out of there. Overall I'm very happy with this urgent care center, I'm glad it's an option now, I would highly recommend to others and I will likely return should the need arise.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I requestest the female doctor for woman problems I was having. I waited in the back room for over 45 minutes while I hear them calling multiple people who came after me to come in the back and the Male PA is helping them pretty quickly. But I was a patient who was there before all of the other people I was some how skipped? They treat you very unfairly.</review>< Pictures>

Dr. Was a lot quicker than I would have like when I was trying to explain issues. Took me about an hour to been seen but they were busy when I showed up.

<pictures>None</pictures><Date>1583094100469</Date><Text>Update: I took my son to be seen he’s had cold symptoms for a couple days but yesterday he spiked a fever. This morning his throat was hurting and the fever was still there, so I brought him here since we’ve been there before and had a good experience. A PA by the name of Micheal Jasso zoomed in, zoomed through evaluating my child (no bed side manners) once he found out my son has a history of asthma he attributed all of his systems to asthma and allergies, even noticing some dog fur on my sons sweatshirt and trying to place blame on our pets. So I spoke up and said my son is not allergic to our pets. If this is in fact allergies, then what about his fever? I had been alternating Motrin and Tylenol for the past two days in order to keep his fever at bay. So at that point he says well he may have a cold but this is allergies. I told him my sons pediatrician would of probably swabbed his throat to be sure it wasn’t strep. So this man says ok well we can go ahead and do that but it’s negative. I looked at him and was thinking wow. This guy is rude and cocky. I said oh you know that without the test? He said yea I do and walked out. I asked the girls in the office for his name. This was my 3rd time there for my kids and one time for my husband. I left three stars because our previous experiences were good. Previously, everyone we’ve dealt with was super nice. Until today. One person can make an entire place look bad.</Text>< gmapID>

I’m highly disappointed I’ve been here twice and both times they forget to send my prescription to the pharmacy. I go to urgent care because I clearly don’t feel well and there is no excuse on why their Medical Assistant can not complete their job I’m a surgical coordinator I definitely know how important patient care is very unacceptable.<//review>

Went in for swelling and a red ring around my knee, only thing they cared about was if the injury was work related. Told them I wasn't sure if the injury happened at home or at work because they don't do the paper work for work related injures. Stated to both individuals I talked to that if my injury comes back as something I could have contracted at work than I'll go see my primary to handle all of my workman comp claims. As soon as I said that they refused to see me. DO NOT MENTION WORK OR YOU WILL BE SOL!!!<//text>

Sooo, I was here  not because I like going to urgent care for everything but I couldn't get in to see my doctor for a month and a half. I was seen by NP Patrick. I do not recommend him to anyone.
He made me feel like I was wasting his time and was very rude.
I explained I think something is wrong with my thyroid.
I was soooo tired all the time and my memory was slipping away from me (at 31)
I was having heart palpitations, coarse voice,  swollen hands and feet and my neck was swollen at the bottom.
He felt my swollen neck and said he didn't feel anything and proceeded to tell me he will do a ekg for palpitations but non of my symptoms are associated with the thyroid and  I have allergies ,so I was prescribed allergy medication.
Anywho I get in to see my dr and I find out  I have hoshimotos.
It would be nice to go to a place to get help where they actually care not disregard your concerns.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Both times I've been here I’ve been impressed by the short wait times, the friendliness of the staff, the general cleanliness and pleasantness of the building, and especially the professionalism and caring manner of the staff.  They will even make an appointment for you if you call ahead.< /text>< rating>

<review>My friend went to visit Urgent Care as her finger was swollen and she was scared. Instead of answering questions for us, Dr. Peter and staff were very unfriendly and were quite condescending and defensive. I was blown away by the poor bedside manner, as my friend was just hoping to have a better understanding on what she should do, what to keep a watch out for, etc.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

The office is very clean and reception staff is friendly. However I waited over an hour for the dr to come in and dismiss my knowledge that I have a sinus infection. He said "You think that's what you have?" Because I didn't have a fever he told me to take saline spray and allergy pills, but didn't listen when I said I have had sinus infections before. He was in the room maybe 3 minutes before telling me I could go. I went to a different dr as soon as I left there and was diagnosed with a sinus infection and received the antibiotics I need.<//text>

After my visit I was waiting in the lobby for my ride and overheard the doctors mocking me and the reason for my stay, which was a severe panic attack. Very unprofessional to be putting my info on blast and mocking it loud enough for the whole lobby to hear. Will not be returning.</text>

This is by far the dirtiest place I've been to the paper wasn't changed dried fluid on the floor pieces of trash just nasty.The floor was dirty.To top it off they are not Dr. They are D.O. in other words didn't complete schooling.If your really sick seek help else where because they don't really diagnose you they treat you for whatever they think.Kinda scary.....</review>

Absolutely the best, freshest donuts around. I just tried their sandwich too. It is a basic sandwich nothing fancy. But, when I say it was good it's an understatement. Try it.</Review>

< Review>
This has been the local "starbucks" long before Starbucks owner was most likely born. Lol The local hollypark veterans go there and talk about sports, news, local info for over 40 years. I have childhood memories of my grandfather walking us here with our saved up pennies to cash them in for donut holes and cola in the glass bottle. They are remodeling the entire corner after 35 years. Change is good but I wonder what took it so long. Donut hold come free now with the purchase of one donut ranging from $1 and up. Wish I would have saved my pennies. Lol< /Review>

This doughnut shop has been around a long time but its extremely mediocre. There is nothing wrong with being a shrewd business owner but this place won't give you an inch, extra pickles on your sandwich? NOPE. Want a bigger cup for your double scoop ice cream? NOPE you have to get this tiny Dixie cup or pay a dollar extra. Skip this place. They will try to squeeze every last penny out of you for a mediocre product. No WiFi, No electrical plugs, and if you go before 12noon the place is filled with retired racist old black dudes who have nothing to do but play the lotto and complain about Mexicans stealing jobs. SKIP THIS PLACE.< /text>

<name>The Mighty<//name><Review>I tried to use the business twice but was turned away by the owner. I drive a Dodge Charger Scatpack and was hearing my front brakes squeak a bit. Without looking, the owner says “$1000 to fix it.”… really dryly. I asked if he even wanted to look and he just said “$1000.” So I left… not big deal.

About a month later, I had what I thought was blown head gaskets. Walked to the shop and explained the situation. Told him I could bring the car over so he could look, he said no need and to “Replace the engine.” Refusing to even look…

Had he just looked, he would have found that it was just a radiator leak and was an easy fix. It’s like he was too good for my money.

Good thing better shops are around.< /Review>< Date>

Wanted to go to a local mechanic, so visited Andrew's Auto Repair in my Inglewood neighborhood. What a great surprise!

<review>Wayne has been the local mechanic for my elderly mother-in-law for several years and has always treated her and her Camry fairly.
Most recently we took car in because were told by tow truck driver (needed for dead battery) that alternator was bad. Wayne checked car with new battery installed and foynd no problem with alternator. A less scrupulous mechanic would have been happy to install a new alternator. Thanks Wayne!< /review></record>

This is the best auto service shop I've ever been to. Honest, Professional and Reasonable prices.  I've had my transmission done on my 2000 Honda Accord here(was done on time as promised) and it's running like new after the repair. Wayne will tell you if you really need the repair/service or not and will tell you how much time you have before it actually broke down on you. Totally recommending this shop to anyone. Thanks Wayne!</Text>

Over this time I've got to know the owner Wayne very well. He kept my 91 Pontiac running for years and now he's taking care of my 2000 Isuzu Rodeo. I guess pretty soon I'll have to let him start taking care of my Hyundai's too. If you're having any Automotive issues I recommend you take your vehicle to him. He's fair and he'll let you know exactly what's wrong and how much it'll cost.</Text><rating>5</rating></record>

<text>Wayne is not a mechanic he’s a Shade tree mechanic if you want to be lied to and pay for your car not to get fixed you found the right place .My car was running hot I went to Andrew’s auto they charged me 87.50 for a  diagnostics I told Wayne I think my water pump maybe going out. Wayne calls me back and says it’s not my water pump but my antifreeze/coolant tank bottle supposedly had a hole in it I was charged $211.00 for the replacement. I woke up the next morning and I noticed antifreeze/ coolant had leaked in my driveway, I returned my car to Andrews auto & explained the issue Wayne shade tree mechanic ass calls me back and says my water pump is out and the cost will be $687.00 to replace. I’m like when you did a  diagnostics of my car the other day which I was already charged for  my water pump was supposedly ok but today you know for sure its out .My question to Wayne at the time was did you actually do diagnostics of my car??? Because if y’all did you would’ve saw that was the issue Originally. Wayne responded by saying he’s been a mechanic for 25yrs and he knows what he is doing. I responded by saying you’ve been hustling people out there money for 25yrs you’re not fixing cars your working people’s pockets and forcing people to go to the dealership or a real mechanic to actually get their cars fixed, beware of this Shade tree mechanic and his  minions.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>I tried to use the business twice but was turned away by the owner. I drive a Dodge Charger Scatpack and was hearing my front brakes squeak a bit. Without looking, the owner says “$1000 to fix it.”… really dryly. I asked if he even wanted to look and he just said “$1000.” So I left… not big deal.

About a month later, I had what I thought was blown head gaskets. Walked to the shop and explained the situation. Told him I could bring the car over so he could look, he said no need and to “Replace the engine.” Refusing to even look…

Had he just looked, he would have found that it was just a radiator leak and was an easy fix. It’s like he was too good for my money.

Good thing better shops are around.</text>< Resp>

I just moved to Inglewood and my car was not acting right. I picked this place because it was walking distance and I'm so glad I did. The owner was polite, very thorough and reasonable. He has my 2001 Toyota running brand new. He advertises by word of mouth. If you need your car fixed right come here. (Black-owned business)< /Text>

<Text>I and my family have been coming to Andrews for years now. It's always a great experience. The prices are reasonable and you never feel "taken" once you get your car back. I love this place, and don't feel the need to go anywhere else.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2b76ca91fd899:0x54543214849d4847</GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< rating>

<text>My 2011 Jeep does not need repairs often, so I was surprised to discover a "check engine light" issue that persisted.  Wanted to go to a local mechanic, so visited Andrew's Auto Repair in my Inglewood neighborhood. What a great surprise! Wayne and his excellent team were exceedingly attentive, concerned and diligent in resolving my engine issues. Very expedient and affordable too. I highly recommend this repair shop the next time you need an important fix!< /text>< pictures>

It seems that finding a trustworthy mechanic has become increasingly difficult lately. Luckily, Wayne and his team are a rare breed. They are expedient, efficient, and competitively priced. I'd recommend anyone check out the shop, whether you're in need of a long-term mechanic or a quick fix.</text>

<review>Wayne has been the local mechanic for my elderly mother-in-law for several years and has always treated her and her Camry fairly.
Most recently we took car in because were told by tow truck driver (needed for dead battery) that alternator was bad. Wayne checked car with new battery installed and foynd no problem with alternator. A less scrupulous mechanic would have been happy to install a new alternator. Thanks Wayne!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

This is the best auto service shop I've ever been to. Honest, Professional and Reasonable prices.  I've had my transmission done on my 2000 Honda Accord here(was done on time as promised) and it's running like new after the repair. Wayne will tell you if you really need the repair/service or not and will tell you how much time you have before it actually broke down on you. Totally recommending this shop to anyone. Thanks Wayne!</review>

<Text>I've been dealing with Andrew's Auto Repair for 17 years now and have yet to have one complaint. Over this time I've got to know the owner Wayne very well. He kept my 91 Pontiac running for years and now he's taking care of my 2000 Isuzu Rodeo. I guess pretty soon I'll have to let him start taking care of my Hyundai's too. If you're having any Automotive issues I recommend you take your vehicle to him. He's fair and he'll let you know exactly what's wrong and how much it'll cost.</Text></record>

Wayne is not a mechanic he’s a Shade tree mechanic if you want to be lied to and pay for your car not to get fixed you found the right place .My car was running hot I went to Andrew’s auto they charged me 87.50 for a  diagnostics I told Wayne I think my water pump maybe going out. Wayne calls me back and says it’s not my water pump but my antifreeze/coolant tank bottle supposedly had a hole in it I was charged $211.00 for the replacement. I woke up the next morning and I noticed antifreeze/ coolant had leaked in my driveway, I returned my car to Andrews auto & explained the issue Wayne shade tree mechanic ass calls me back and says my water pump is out and the cost will be $687.00 to replace. I’m like when you did a  diagnostics of my car the other day which I was already charged for  my water pump was supposedly ok but today you know for sure its out .My question to Wayne at the time was did you actually do diagnostics of my car??? Because if y’all did you would’ve saw that was the issue Originally. Wayne responded by saying he’s been a mechanic for 25yrs and he knows what he is doing. I responded by saying you’ve been hustling people out there money for 25yrs you’re not fixing cars your working people’s pockets and forcing people to go to the dealership or a real mechanic to actually get their cars fixed, beware of this Shade tree mechanic and his  minions.</text>

Horrible experience with canceling! If you call to cancel, Do Not believe it when they tell you that it’s cancelled. Follow up! It took over a year. And when you dispute the charges that kept occurring for a year after my initial cancellation date, they claim they can’t find where you cancelled (even though the telephone representative was able to tell me exactly). It’s just form, after form, after form AFTER you’ve called to cancel. Then you have to dispute the over $200 in charges (which is yet another form), then you get an email saying they are giving you a partial refund and that “Your case has been reviewed in detail and all decisions are final. No further consideration will be given to this claim.” Not happy!< /review>

<review>If I could give them zero stars I would. I had to cancel my Shakeology and On Demand at the end of last month. However, I was charged a service fee of $15.95 on May 13 when I wasn't receiving anything from them. So I called Customer Service. That is, I had to wait 15 to talk to someone named Nicholas. He should be fired. When I told him what the issue was, he said "it's ok" and I started to say I just waited 15 minutes and I'm wasting my time calling for something I shouldn't have to call about because it should have been cancelled along with the other 2 things. Guess what he did? He hung up on me! So now I have to sit on hold again and hope someone can help me. I can't recommend BeachBody to anyone. Buyer beware!<//review>< pics>

<Text>this place ruined my life. fraud. inefficient management. very poor leaders - they care for themselves. Never work for them. Pyramid scam. No business plan. Bad Politics & lots of hate story.
I feel sorry for the owners. They are relying on wrong set of people. Complete management is sucking their money out and not delivering anything back. Hope John & Carl will understand soon. Laying off 100+ people every year will never bring business back.

John & Carl.
You need to get right leaders who can give you out of box thought to make your business successful again. Its clearly visible that you guys are out of ideas now. And your inefficient management is not capable to deliver anything to help you out. Else, this ship will go down slowly</Text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>About a year after cancelling the program, it started up with requesting it and without our knowledge.  I only noticed it after 6 quarterly payments when I was reviewing my credit card charges to move recurring charges to another card. I disputed through my bank and got 1 payment back.  I called Beach Body and the promised to give me another 2 back--I have yet to see it hit my account. I pushed to get a full refund of all the payments and when they declined, I filed a complaint with the BBB.  They called me and then told me that only 1 payment had been approved and that they were willing to give me back 2 more for a total of 4 of the 6 payments--none of which were requested or authorized.  Given the fact that the app is unstable and streaming unreliable, I suspect that these folks are a little technically challenged--to include a possible problem with their online security. Either that or they look through their dormant accounts and magically sign them up for services un-requested and then refuse a full refund--how's that for a business model.  Better to find a more ethical and secure alternative.< /review>< Pics>

<user_name>Jōjia Momo< /user_name><time>1570551311922<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This "company" is an MLM pyramid scheme.

The average income per year for a person that is only retailing Team Beachbody products is $500 per year.    The cost per month for Shakeology is $129.95 which is $1,559.40 per year.

44.73% of Beachbody coaches do not receive a bonus or commission.

69% of Beachbody coaches make $500 on average per year.

91% of Beachbody coaches make $3,454 or less on average per year.

Team Beachbody is a great way to make less than part time minimum wage.

Team Beachbody is just another business opportunity recruiting scam.  Their coaches have almost no requirements and are MLM sales people. They require increasing personal volume as you advance in rank in the compensation plan.  Recruiting is required to advance in rank in the compensation plan.

There are many reports of difficulty in canceling your auto-shipment orders and monthly coach fees.  There is little opportunity to make a significant income retailing the Team Beachbody products.< /text>< Pics>

I am returning my first and second order and canceling any future orders.  I had ask the person I called with when I placed my first order not to send any other orders until I tried the first order.  They sent it any way.  I have asked them to please refund my money.</Text>

I ordered CIZE and it came with the vitamins.  I paid the $89.36 at that time.  I did not know they were going to keep sending the vitamins.  That was on March 22.  When the shipment of vitamins came, I immediately cancelled them.  So, on 4/20, they charged me $42.08, on 4/21  $65.26, on 5/20 $59.90, on 6/20 $59.90, and on 7/20 $59.90. so, 4 months ago, I stopped getting vitamins but they keep getting money!  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was forced to give one star.  They should get none.  I am so concerned I will never get my money back AND they will try to keep charging me!< /review>

<text>Great products that work and I am not a coach; however I ordered two programs so far and lost 20 lbs following the nutrition plan and workouts (21 Day Fix and Hammer and Chisel), and I must say that this is easiest way to lose weight without complicated moves and diets. As far as other poor reviews I ignore them because when I ordered Shakeology first time and communicated to my coach that I need to cancel autoship she immediately stopped and I never was charged further. Each customer works with his/her coach so bad reviews are due to misunderstanding of either coach or a customer. You just need to work with reliable person because each coach is on commission. :)</text>< Name>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I have purchased DVD's  from your company many time in the past with Shaun T, Charlene Johnson, PX90. I recently purchased your latest DVD piyo. Only to be terribly disappointed with the quality  of the DVD it's self.
I called customer service twice in two days, the first rep told me to go threw each one to make sure the all worked properly, that is not my job.
The second rep told me he had receive 3 calls that week with complaint about the DVD it's self.  Then he asked me what he could do to make it better I said send me good quality DVD he said he could not do that and I would have to return my purchase and reorder again. I'm returning with no intend to purchase from your company again.

Thank you for your time,

<review>I was on the phone with a representative of Beachbody for more than 50 minutes this morning for something trivial. The credit card I had on-file with Beachbody was canceled after card company discovered some suspicious activity. A new card (same card different number) was sent out but has not yet arrived yet. Since I'm signed up for monthly shipments of Shakeology, an automatic charge is placed on my card monthly but the transaction was not successful this month for that reason. An "action required" email was sent to me which included a number I was supposed to call and so I did. At the very beginning of the conversation, I made it clear that all I wanted was to update my credit card info, so that I can continue to receive my monthly shipment of Shakeology. Any other company would have done just that in a matter of seconds and I'd be off to work on time. For some reason, this representative kept acknowledge that he understood what I wanted but kept trying to solve problems that didn't exist. We went through different sections of membership - reinstatement/cancellation and I just kept repeating that all I wanted was to update my credit card information. At around the 48 minute mark, I think he finally did what I asked. My fingers are crossed that he actually successfully completed the trivial task, so I will be watching my credit card transaction history very closely in the coming weeks!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>I have had a terrible time with this company.  I had my account paid in full with them, and cancelled my subscription to their vitamins (very expensive, by the way, and I noticed no difference in how I felt or my ability to lose weight).  SIX MONTHS LATER I was contacted by a collection agency via e-mail, out of the blue.  I called Beachbody, and they assured me I owed them nothing, and they would correct the problem with the collection agency.  Now, three weeks later, I have gotten a letter from the collection agency.  Upon calling Beachbody again, they have told me that they will take care of it, and that I should not answer any future letters from the collection agency.   I hate to think what this is doing to my credit score, and all over a bill that was paid.  Also, it is very hard to get a real person when you try to contact Beachbody, so it is hard to even attempt to rectify problems.<//text><Name>Margaret Black</Name>< response>

They have been charging me for 3 years after a “free” trial with multiple phone calls to cancel. Finally escalated to the corporate office and they say they can’t do any refund unless I fill out a form for their finance team. Look at their BBB rating! Over 500 claims.<//Review>

< Review>
I am not writing this review on the companies products (created OUTSIDE the company).  I am writing on their customer service.  Terrible customer service.

I placed an order on the 21st from their website (rather than Amazon, etc) due to their promotion of free Express Shipping of 3-5 days.  Was told I would receive and email within 24 hours with my shipping information.  I received a DELAYED shipping email on the 28th (7 days later) due to them "moving warehouses"...yet they contract their warehouse to Intellisource in OH and NV.  They had sent an email to customers on the 17th due to the "same" thing - so KNEW WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER on the 21st that 3-5 business days would be IMPOSSIBLE to meet.

If you do choose to purchase the wonderful products they have..... I would suggest you purchase from an OUTSIDE provider such as Amazon.  At least they have some integrity.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>After losing 2 1/2 hours of my life trying to deal with your call center which was worse than calling Comcast, I give up. When there is a "difficult" question, your awful call center automatically transfers you to the beginning of the call tree after 30 minutes of hold if they are calling over to technical support to fix your account. This happened to me THREE TIMES. Of all the millions you people make, you need to do something about this. Seriously worse than Comcast.

I tried to reactivate BBOD. I cancelled after the quarter because I wasn't using it. Apparently the account went "inactive" and when trying to pay to start up again it kept looping to my payment over and over again. An hour and a half on the phone and nobody could get it working and I kept getting sent to the beginning of the call tree again after 30 min.

Sick to death of this and wanting to get back to my life, I simply created a new account and paid with a different credit card.

At this point all I want is for them to transfer my purchases and I've spent hundreds with BeachBody and have a big spending potential if I stick with them. But after this?

This was so awful if there was someone else who provided the service I would have changed to them in a heartbeat. I think the only way to make this right would be a bag of Shakeology but that still wont get the day I spent on the phone being bounced every which way and still no resolution back.<//review>< time>

They will Bill you every 3 months even if you say "NO" to membership!  I just wanted $50 in product not additional $41.98 quarterly sneaky membership fee they hope you do not realize.. Liars, liars, liars, I called and Heidy said they would send me email of our recorded message, never got it or, my $125.94 unauthorized charges back. Watch out... keep an eye on your credit cards.< /Review>

They exceeded our expectations. They always kept us informed and they work so fast. Our car looks amazing. The best part of all the experience is their customer service. Free pick up and drop off and the follow up call is a great plus!!! I thought this only happens in a health care setting. How awesome is that?!< /text>

I’ve had to take my corolla here twice in the past year & they are truly amazing. They have great customer services, friendly and efficient plus their communication is wonderful. Mike is also so nice when speaking to him over the phone and gives you a call to update you as the process is moving along. I highly recommended this shop.</Text>

The front receptionist was very friendly and helpful. Rick was very professional,informative and thorough, detailing the repairs required. The workmanship was excellent and the cost was very reasonable. I was given daily updates which was a plus.I highly recommend this body shop and will recommend it to both friends and family.< /review>

<Review>I absolutely loved my experience here. The front desk receptionist was extremely friendly and all staff treated me with respect and maturity even though I am young. Victor was very professional and ensured my car was left in impeccable condition and even had it cleaned! Would definitely recommend as they also have great prices!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

My car was rear ended and they did a great job with the repairs. We loved the text updates which included a link to the progress of the work, as well as an estimate. They were able to give me a new bumper and everyone we encountered was extremely professional. Chris, our primary contact, was very nice and extremely thorough. I will definitely take my car back if I ever need work done in the future.<//Review>

My highlander had major damage on front driver part because of collision from side. Mike's auto body was quick to provide estimate in a day and started working on it immediately. The vehicle was repaired to look as new with OEM parts as promised in 10 days. When I took it back to Mike's because of low battery indicator, the manager Shawn Marsh told me that it might have been damaged inside because of collision and offered to contact insurance to pay for replacement battery. Though I was busy on week days, Shawn followed up with me 3 times and replaced the battery by himself. Shawn understood the pain of bringing the vehicle back to his shop and promised to take care of anything else that comes up. From talking to Shawn, I understood that as part of repairs, they get surprises and it takes a little longer than they estimate. I highly recommend Mike's!!<//Text>

I had a worst experience ever in my life. They almost kept me waited for one hour. As i was watching them there was no rush. she had attended only two to three customers who came after me. The front desk staff was so rude and disrespectful. They have no proper guidance how to operate with customers. After one hour when I approached her she took my appointment seriously. I don’t even want to give one star. But there was no option.< /Text>

<Text>I heard this place was getting rave reviews, however I was unsatisfied with a lazy, unprofessional estimator.
I took my business elsewhere and am very satisfied with the professional estimate I received from another body shop.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Good service and they call you with updates and try to serve you in everyway possible.

They have drop of service after 9 am but schedule the drop of if you are hedding there before that time . They will try to accomodate.

They will work with most insurance companies and once you sechedule body work they send you reminder and help you through out.< /text>< Pics>

Anthony at Avo’s Body Shop is the best. Some clown hit my car and their insurance company went to Avo’s and gave Anthony grief and then called me and gave me grief. Anthony stood his ground and fought them for me, so I didn’t have to. Because they wanted to fix my car in a substandard method and Anthony wouldn’t allow it and the girl had hygiene issues and was difficult to be near, I decided to call my insurance and they took care of everything. Because the other clown’s insurance took all responsibility, I didn’t have to pay a deductible and Anthony even fixed a few minor things at no extra charge for me.
If I could give him more stars I would have, but I recommend everyone take their car to Avo’s. They will make sure it is right and they won’t let anyone take advantage of you.
My Uncle was a Body Shop foreman many years ago and he told me what took look for. You can't see where the car was damaged, it was so clean and well done, I was amazed. Thank you, Anthony<//text>

They just find different ways to make money out of you, and they are very  greedy and dishonest. I gave them car to fix but after 1 week they said it cannot be fixed and you have to pay the assemble fee to get the car back. After I got my car back engine light came on and when I told them about the engine light they said they cannot do anything about it because you signed a release waiver.</Text>

We camped here in our fifth wheel a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday and really crowded.  We were half an hour early before check in so we needed to just wait. We saw a sign that said RV parking only. No vehicles. Perfect! A place we could hang out and wait. I jumped out to get food. Soon after my husband called and said he had to move the RV. I walked over from the cafe to see if our spot was open and it was, so I texted him to drive over to our spot. As I was helping my husband back in the RV, a woman walked up to me and pointed her finger at me and sternly said, “YOUR HUSBAND PARKED IN SOMEONE ELSE’S SPOT!” Confused, I replied, “what”?  She repeated the same thing, pointing at him and then pointing back at me for some reason. I said, “who are you?” She said she was the camp host. I was so confused because I had no idea what she was talking about. I explained there was a sign that said RV parking, and we were just waiting 30 min. for check in.  (See picture) It doesn’t say campsites. She didn’t care and said, “At least you actually do have a reservation because most people lie about that too!! So obviously you have never stayed with us , so let’s go over the rules!!”  She didn’t introduce herself when she walked up to me, just pointed her finger and yelled, was never friendly, and talked down to us the whole time. I’m pretty sure her name was Beverly. Then, the next morning at 5 am traffic began, since the RV spots are actually on the road, you hear everyone driving to work. We will never camp there again.< /Text>

<Text>I love this town and beach!  We are locals, lived here in SLO County from birth. We have always wanted to camp by the ocean in Avila but have never been able to get in. We have managed to stay at the RV camping up on the bluff. So, I was so excited when I managed to get a site at the Nobi area! Campsite #5 was the only site I could find available. For 4 nights!  Not over the weekend, but we were super happy to get one at all. The day we were leaving to come camp I checked the website and found out that Nobi 3 was available for two of the 4 nights we were there!  If you’ve been to Nobi, you know that site 5 is directly behind 3 and a camper in 3 can pretty much totally block site 5’s view of the ocean. Well, it was too late to cancel our original reservation without full penalty. But to us, it was worth it to pay for both sites to be able to have the unobstructed view of the ocean for two of the days.  I quickly reserved #3 and we were on our way. We stayed the first night with a small motor home between us and the ocean. The second night, the view was ours and we enjoyed it immensely. On the 3rd day the camp host texted me and asked when we were coming in. I responded that we were there already, parked in space 5. A few minutes later the camp hosts drove up, we had an issue and that we could not occupy 2 spaces unless we had another camper in the other one. We explained what happened. Their only response was, see the port for reimbursement.  We’ll we didn’t mind losing the money, especially if we had unknowingly broken the rules. The next day a huge Tiffan motor home with a full size Jeep pulled in, right in front of us. Gone was all of our view.  We were so disappointed. If we’d known the hosts were going to cancel one of reservations for that day, we would have chooses to move into the view site. But we had been told nothing about opening one of the sites we paid for to another camper.  My husband went to talk to the office the next day. They basically said, tough, you broke the rule, it’s too popular here for someone to have two sites and not occupy both. No refund. We ended up enjoying some days and hours with the spot in front of us empty. But the whole experience with the hosts was so negative it took a lot of joy out of our vacation. It could have been handled so much better, we are generally rule followers and would have cooperated with the rules, we just would have liked to have more friendly understanding conversations with the representatives of the port.<//Text>< Pics>

Great stay, best dog beach ever!!  We were on Nobi Point, site 5, which is right next to the road.  The site is really just a dirt pad, but the location was great.  We really enjoyed ourselves and the dogs loved the beach.  We’ll definitely be back.  4 stars because the road noise was rough - the first night there was what seemed like about a one - two hour parade of trucks at about 2:30am.  The next morning about 4:45 - 6:00 seemed like the shift change from the power plant and maybe some fishing folks.  That said, I’d come back - we really did enjoy ourselves.</text>

Never realized how much traffic is on the road here, at all hours.  Just happy to be next to the beach and the fact that it's not the weekend.</Review>

<text>Camp host was very friendly... Called to ask if they could give our reserved spot to another camper. That earned them a star.

But then they tried not to refund our payment.  Really?  Wow.  Ungrateful and greedy. Getting paid twice for the same spot.  Amazing how unethical some people are.</text>< pictures>

Traffic goes all night long. Every shift change at the power plant brings hundreds of cars within a few feet of your camp site late night and early moring. $23 dump fee. They even charge for water. No refunds if you decide to leave early. Would not stay here again.</review>

<review>Some of the best views for camping. It's within walking distance to the Port & services. They have showers and laundry services for quarters. The downside is it's all first come first serve with no reservations. It fills up fast so come before the weekend and holidays or you might not get a spot. It also pretty experience for camping and a 14 day max</review>< pictures>

$50-70/night?! That's insane. That's like $2000/mo, for a place to park. I've lived in houses and had apartments in SLO for less than that. That's the price of a hotel with room cleaning services daily. Is there staff going to come and clean my parking space every day, or at least between guests? nope. Ripoff.< /text>

It's right on the water so that is amazing. But no real infrastructure so you should be very self contained.< /Text>

This is our favorite place! The only thing is that the shower rooms are getting run down. Otherwise it's dog friendly and we love the beach. There is also so much to offer out on the Old Port.</review>

Campsites are bare minimum. Very strict on no generator rule, although the guy next to us ran his most the night. They do not allow campfires of any kind, even a little Weber BBQ. The camp host was angry with the way my husband deposited our payment in the box and came and berated me for a good 15 minutes, even though I clearly had no idea what he was talking about and stated that to him numerous times. The only plus is it's an ok "staycation", and you wake up to beautiful views and easy access fishing, boating and swimming.<//Review>

Roadside rip-off :(

52 USD for dry camping in January, this place simply offers some roadside asphalt.

Showers were old and dirty, this place hasn't seen any love in a long time. Instead you get a rap on the door in the morning to remind you that checkout is at noon.< /review>

Best Fedex in town! Customer service is above and beyond!! And parking is everywhere, no homeless, cleaning street and piece of mind to print. And all next to the freeway, print and go for real.</Text>

I would not recommend this place to anyone.

Put in a print order and paid online for a time sensitive deliverable and guess what? Their "system" has been down and couldn't even tell if there were any print jobs sent to them. No one told me. I still got a confirmation. I was expecting to show up and pick up my print job but when I called to confirmed they literally told me to go else where "maybe another FedEx printing location can help" it's almost 5 PM..... this is horrible customer service.<//review>

<Review>Closes at 5 and I got there at 4:55. Understandably, the employee was annoyed they I showed up right before close, but he started huffing and puffing and saying how he already shut down the computers and said “I mean do you really want me to turn it back on? It’s going to take another 5 minutes” like uh maybe don’t turn it off early<//Review>< pics>

Poor packers and service. They returned a package that they had packed and broken that had my handmade ceramics in it. Also made me wait in line, then told me they wouldn't send my packages after "thinking about it". Stay away and use another business.<//Review>

I had to ship an item and was looking for boxes. She stated that I needed to use an electronics box and proceeded to pull it out and package my item. She never once said that there was a charge for that Fedex box she pulled from the back. I didn't find out about the cost until she rung everything up. The box was the same cost as the shipping cost. At this point, it's not like I can remove my item from the box. She should have said something. I felt very deceived.<//Text>< Resp>

I have an awful experience at this place EVERYTIME I go, without fail. These people are BY FAR the most unmotivated, stupid, disrespectful people I've ever seen. They consistently act like they're doing YOU a favor by helping you.

These shipping companies need more competition.</review>

< Review>
I've been shipping boxes for the last two weeks and there are two women there that are so kind and they are fast and do things at a good pace. The "manager" Omar is theeeeeee slowest and seems to be unintelligent person that I have ever met to be named a manager. He asks the same question numerous times. When I asked which scale to put my 52 pound package on he tells me one scale then after I lifted it tells me "oh sorry I meant the other one". I'm sorry I'm a small woman and to lift that large of a box is a task to begin with. That's why I wanted to do it only once. I'm a very productive person that appreciates consolidation and this man lacks all of those characteristics. He seems to lack energy and focus. And I am amazed fedex has someone like that representing their store as a manager.<//Review>

<Review>We asked for a package to be sent next day to Napa Ca. The sales person was more concerned with selling us a special box for our items and instead rung transaction up as ground shipping, which was not received the next day. I had to buy replacement items to be sent to our client cause 4 days later they had not yet received our original item.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Had a great time staying here. It was $10 extra for another car since our friend joined us. It was no problem! There are lots of campsites but they do fill quick and it was busy even on a Thursday night. Close to town, the rock, places to eat, and the water! Highly recommend!< /text>

Loved staying at Morro Bay State Park Campground. Beautiful location just off the bay in eucalyptus groves. The bird estuary is right across the street and the trailhead to Black Hill starts in the campground. Just a short drive into town and Morro Rock. Loop 118 - 135 is the best section of the campground.< /review>

<time>1621433952443< /time><Text>Camping spaces are too close together, so one inconsiderate camper can ruin the trip. Might be ok if you're in a well-insulated RV with blackout curtains, but the noise and lights well after "lights out" made for a difficult night.

I think the only way I'd return is by getting a group together and using the group camp. It's up the hill, separated from the rest of the campground, and seems very nice.</Text>< resp>

I got an ant infestation in my RV that lasted a month. I had to take it to a place to put a tarp over it and exhumed it. I was given my money back for what I paid for the reservation, which I appreciated, and I am pretty sure that this was a one-off type of thing, as I have camped a lot and have never had this happen. They should really check the grounds though. As far as the campground it's not that great. The ocean is really not accessible to walk from this Campground. There is an area across from the campground near a marina that you can walk, but it's just a boardwalk and not very long. It's very beautiful though, but there is no Beach. The campsites are close  and a lot of campers are noisy even after 10 pm.< /text>

Decent campground, decent price, lovely setting.

Pros:
- Lots of trees; an actual campground type setting (not a parking lot)
- Significantly less expensive than the privately owned campgrounds nearby
- Accepts reservations
- Quiet/peaceful
- People staying in the campground are generally friendly
- Dogs allowed
- Camp sites each have a table, fire pit, and a BBQ (bring your coals!!)

Cons:
- Not near the beach or downtown
- Campsites are right on top of each other, so you hear and see everything the neighbors are saying & doing, and kids have no place to play without being in another camper's space
- Overzealous park rangers (caretakers?) - we were told we couldn't run our RV's heater overnight because of it being outside of allowed generator hours. (No, we weren't running the RV's generator or engine.)
- Reservations are site specific, and no site switching is permitted after check-in, even if the site is empty/unreserved.
- Drive-throughs not allowed, to check it out before you reserve. (This*may* be Covid related)

Overall decent experience, just be sure going in that you are ready to be patient with the other campers, as it's frequently full to capacity (and that means you'll have very little wiggle room).< /Text>

One of the best public campgrounds in California.  Nicely shaded spots with community water near every spot. Within walking distance of town. Wine country nearby.<//text>

<Text>One of our favorite campground on the Central Coast.  Great camp hosts too!  Luv the peacefulness of this park as the rules don't allow generators except for specific hours which are less than other state parks! California Quails, Wild Turkeys, California Condors and Perrigrin Falcons all nest in the area, so much beauty to take in! Support your State Parks!!<//Text>< Pics>

We camped here in June, 2 years ago. This is one of my favorite camp ground and it is great for biking, hiking, bird watching, walking on the beach. The Museum is just across the street. There are also a lot of restaurants and shops nearby, just a mile away from the camp. Facilities are well maintained. They have private bathroom and showers. Showers need token though. One token is 2 min each. Each camp is spacious has picnic table and chairs, camp fire bins and barbecue grill. During the night, it is really cold and you can hear the waves crushing to the rocks.<//text>

Excellent stay at Morro Bay camp ground. The staff were polite and helpful. There was a mix of RVs, trailers, trailer tents and tents. There's a good family atmosphere. Plenty of drinking water.</Review>

The campground is very close to the hiking trails and kayak shack. We took a walk from this place to the museum and bay. The sites are a bit too close but amenities are good. The flush toilets and showers are available.<//Review>

hike&bike campground available here for 10$. Quiet place with a golf place next by. Hot shower by coin works well and toilet is nicely maintained. There’s a cafe & restaurant by the sea within 5 min walking.< /text>

<review>Lots of level trail walking, huge golf course next to camp ground.  Beach with ocean across from camp ground, not a ideal place to Wade through or to swim, Kayka boats available for rental. Lots of public bathrooms,  pet friendly,  check out Bayside Cafe, Morro Bay National History museum self tour , $3.00 entrance fees.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp9xwRpblGYzGmq0IjFmL1ZcaC7wN6SFkIbGfS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiyDIM4S_mBBW7VHy-5qZoTcB_L6VcS1AKpYjE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGEygTEgnjn273oIVnqBdrTNYSRguEHsld9QSQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHfQY8INUsCosn29issCo9uBOilMQ2nSAnWXVF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU4yr9KWeIxtCABYkZ9EgiSxM3Ut5A2PguAfqb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

1st time here. We were rv/ dry camping. Family of 5 plus Grandma, so 6. Very quiet and beautiful camp ground. Far enough away from the main, street/town but also VERY close! This is now our favorite camp ground and will return on the future. They had tables, camp fire bin, and or rock bbq.</Review>

<Review>Excellent! We come every year about this time...nice days and cool nights for a camp fire. Plenty of outdoor things do...hiking, kayaking, mountain biking, charter fishing and beautiful scenery. The back bay is a few hundred yards away.

Facilities are cleaned daily, firewood on site and they'll deliver it to your spot if needed.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Generator apocalypse!  This site would be nice if not for the constant generator noise. State parks should either put in rv hookups or ban generator use. Totally unpleasant in the evenings. Completely unnecessary with current battery and solar technology. The front gate person was nice so there is an extra star for them.</review>

<text>Great spot with the beach just feet away (depending on you site). It is a parking lot turned campground bit they have full hookups if you have a trailer/RV. There are no showers at this site but being on the beach makes up for it! Also, there is a trolley that runs through the site going to the 'downtown'. Will be going again!</text>< Name>

An easy walk to the ocean, great wildlife. The showers were clean.  Be aware that the showers require tokens.  50 cents buys 2 minutes of shower time.< /review>

<Review>Nice location across from the Bay. Water and 30amp only.  Coin showers are ice cold. Toilets need repairs..broken valves.. drains plugged. Tight spaces. Can only stay 10 nights must leave for 48 hours. Max 20 nights per year. Moved to MB Strand. . .a parking lot on the beach with full hookup. Both often full on weekends. No showers at MB Strand. Stayed February 2020.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Well maintained and large campsite, variety of said available from almost full hookups (no sewer, but there is a dump station), to large tent sites, to hiking/biking/walk in only sites, and day use picnic area.
All rv sites are pull throughs.</Review>< pictures>

This is one of my favorite camp grounds.  The sites toward the back are less cramped and have a lot of space to spread out.  There is an abundance of things to do in walking distance from the camp.  Kayak rentals in the bay and you can hit the sand dunes, hike the peaks just East of the camp, visit the museum across the street, fish in the bay, golf, explore the marsh, just to name a few...<//text>

Camp sites tent to flood when it rains fyi but there is high ground in most for tents, but this is a RV Trailer spot. I am a car and tent site, had no issues that didnt involve me booking week before stay and getting the scraps as far as site pickings. Great sunset within a short walk. Showers and toilets are some of DPR's finest here.</text>

It's OK in a pinch.

Cons: Noisy, crowded, smokey, very small spaces, nearby electronic foghorn sounds all night. The "fire rings" are like half-height barrels and ruin any campfire experience because you can't really see the fire. If you're used to clamping in nice spots, Morro Bay SP Campground is sure to disappoint.

Pros: Very nice bathrooms with flush toilets,  convenient to nearby sights.< /text>

<text>One of our most favorite camping getaways, weather is always great, there are trails everywhere, the museum is on the property and better yet, the trolley comes by to take you to the embarcadero...does it get any better than that?<//text>< pictures>

You must make reservations 48 hours ahead of time online if you want a guaranteed place!
But they do seem to have several cancellations if you are patient and check in a couple of times a day.<//Text>< time>

The camp site was clean and the people were nice they planted trees in between the spots which is nice. The bathrooms were not very clean and the shower was questionable. I hate that charge for the showers and there is only 2 spots to change your money into tokens.<//review>

We love tent camping here.  There are lots of trees and a great view of the estuary and mountains.   We use the fire pit to cook or just sit by at night.  Fire wood sold at the campgrounds.  Bring along a couple of chairs for sitting by the fire. Bathrooms are available and cleaned daily.  Showers take tokens.  Peaceful atmosphere where everyone quiets down by 10pm.
Restaurant, museum and beaches nearby.  Going into Morro Bay for fresh fish to cook at the campsite is a treat.  Cambria is about 20 minutes away.</text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>We have been camping here for years. It's a beautiful place. Things have been changing for the worse. They have new policies, and none of them are good. You used to be able to pay $10 for an extra vehicle at your site; Now, you still have to pay, but you are not allowed to park at your cite. You have to park in an overflow area, and if that's full, you have to park at a nearby marina, where your vehicle is susceptible to theft or vandalism. Also, we were told we weren't allowed to bring our own firewood, leaving only the option of buying it at the campground for a very high price. The campground also switched from using Reserve America to using Reserve California.  Not a goid choice. Reserve California is very unorganized and has illogical rules.</review>< pictures>

Basic spot with hook ups for 50 bucks.  Around the park there are nice areas to walk around.  Nice shopping about a mile away.  Overall a descent place.  Good Verizon signal.  I would go back.< /review>

<Review>Very friendly staff and perfect location for hiking, golfing... Sites are a little close together inviting conversations with your neighbors. We like privacy, but we met wonderful people! We will come back based on the location. My only general complaint about California State Parks is that the reserve America system left us with some pretty awful sites that we were stuck with because you cannot change even though there are many better sites available. Reserving may not be the way to go.</Review><username>Quiteria Perreira<//username>< Rate>

First time tent camping so I don't have much experience but it was a nice place. Plenty of tall trees (though if you're allergic to eucalyptus beware- I survived on allergy pills). The bathrooms were kept clean, my biggest complaint is that the sites are very close together and privacy is non-existent.</text>

I like this place. It's a bit crowded most of the time, but never been bothered by that. Staff's always been friendly and helpful. My old undergraduate home, Cal PolySLO is right down Hwy. 1 from camp. Can always drive into SLO town for dinner and a movie if desired. Or do the same around the corner in downtown Morro Bay.< /Text>

Beautiful location. Some sites have hookups, ours didn't, but we are equipped for boondocking. You can run a generator 10am-8pm. Solar panels are a plus. Lots of people coming and going. A very popular place. We had sunny weather most of the time. 60's days, cold nights.<//text>

The lawns were all Dead, the smoke was rather overwhelming because many people were burning their trash along with fire wood. Kids were being kids riding their bikes through other people's campsites, but it is a public campground at the beginning of the summer season. Lastly a lady and her kids were beginning to leave the campground and tied their dog to the left side door of the car and forgot when she left the campsite and the dog was pulled under the rear wheel breaking the dogs neck and it took 10 minutes to die violently in pain screaming. Oh what fun we all had at this campground!!!</text>

Like any other state park it is not much more than a parking somewhere of the beaten track. Where national parks overload you with information, hiking trails etc. also this state park is just interested in receiving $35 for a small dry standing site.....and that is it. Location close to a marina with a restaurant (only open for dinner in the weekends) and a golf course.< /review>

< Review>
This place is great for the whole family. If you like hikeing there are lots of trails around the park, all with stunning ocean views. Restrooms could be cleaner and if you need to plug in your electronic devices, good luck finding a plug. Have a fire if you like, they sell wood on site. The campground is right next to Morro Bay Golf Coarse and the ocean so there's plenty to see around here. It would be smart to call for a reservation, just in case.<//Review>

This is a great place to walk the estuary boardwalk, explore the tide pools and see the boats in the harbor up close. Spend the day and leave relaxed and enlightened.<//Review>

By far my favorite campground of any I have visited. Getting reservations is difficult and must be done far in advance, but it is worth it!< /review>

Great location with trees and short walks to town and/or nature trails. Kayak rentals across the street for the bay which is also across the street. Pricey. Extra car is an extra $10. Towed or not!</text>

Beside estuary - migration spots for birds. Also sea mammals
Camp is well run. Is often fully booked at weekends 6 months ahead. Go Sun thru Thursday if you can.<//Text>

<review>I enjoyed my stay at Morro Bay State Park. I camped at the Hike-Bike campsite. It's tucked away between the standard campsite and the golf course, no vehicle accessibility. I met a couple of bikers over there, we had a good time chatting next to the campfire in the middle of the woods far from the RVs. Hot shower, running water, close to the bay and the natural history museum. 2 nights max for hiker bikers.</review>< Pics>

Great location only minutes away from the beach/shops. The campsite is well kept, amenities clean and all staff friendly. We thought $35 was a reasonable price for a tent site considering the location. We would definitely recommend this campground.<//text>

Recently camped here with 11 people so we had two sites. One of our sites in the middle of the campground was taken over by others by the time we got there so the rangers were accommodating and let us all stay at our bigger site at the end of a row. My only complaint was that the larger shower facility was closed.</Review>

Beautiful place and a lot to do..but honestly we were 2-3 feet from our neighbors in all directions. Stay away from the sites in the middle if you prefer a view other than the inside of your neighbors RV.  They would be great for family reunions though. To top it off we paid 7 dollars for wood that was too wet to burn.< /review>

<Text>What a place! Situated in the midst of one of the most spectacular nature viewing areas, this state park is high on the list of our favorites. We launched our kayak at the free California state park launch site across the street from the campground entrance and paddled up the estuary past harbor seals, hundreds of pelicans, blue herons, egrets, and over a hundred other species of shore birds. Visiting the Bayside Cafe, steps from the campground in the marina, with views of Morro Bay, is also a must.< /Text>< time>

Morro Bay State Park has been my favorite campground for sixty years   My dad introduced us to the park when I was eight years old.  Over the years the campground has gotten run down, bathrooms and showers closed due to needed repairs, and those that are open are deplorable, sharing your showers with ants, spiders, mold, doors that won't lock,  and occasionally cold water.  At $38.50 - 50.00 a night it should be better, but unfortunately the powers that be have decided to continue to let the park go downhill.  The hookups are generally always full, and the rest if the park is too in the summer.  I am wondering where the money is going, certainly not being put back in this campground.< /text>

<Review>Wonderful and laid back. The summer months let you take the trolley into town. But year round, your moments away from a great city, beautiful hikes and relaxing strolls.

You'll not go wrong picking this as a camp ground.< /Review>< gmapID>

It's a nice and very clean campground. The campsite was a tad tight but we still had more than enough room.

If you've been camping at shaver and Pismo then the size of the the Morro Bay site seemed larger than shaver's but smaller than pismo's.<//Text>

It is a nice and well located California State Park.
We regret the lack of supervision!  In mid-June many camosites were overcrowded and the noise level was very high!!  We never saw a Park Ranger or anyone checking the number of campers in each campsite or the noise level.  The bathrooms were overcrowded and 2 were not in very good shape!  Saw cars double parked instead of being in the overflow parking. Better supervision would help!  Thanks.</review>

Very close together tent camping spots. Does not appear that the campground host or employees enforce the "quiet hours". Many different groups talking loudly enough at 1 am to be heard several sites away. Quite a few bathrooms and showers are tagged "Out of Order". Many sites are so small that a 10 x 10 tent would be all that will fit without being on part of a neighboring site.<//Review>

It's a nice place to camp right on the bay and less than 2miles from the embarcadero/downtown Morro Bay. The only negative for me is that the campground is laid out to get as many campers as possible in there kinda like sardines in the can. They have hot showers and flush toilets as well as boat launchs and there's a golf course right next to the campground<//Text>

Friendly staff, kayak rentals close by and same price as other campgrounds with no showers e.g.
You have to pay for warm water in the showers like the other state parks.< /text>

<text>Used to be a great place!

Showers are out dated and filthy and your sharing them with spiders an bugs. Campers are loud and disrespectful they walk right through your campsite some ignorant people just drive right through them.  Oh, and you get to buy tokens to take a shower TOKENS Seriously? WHICH MACHINES TO BUY TOKEN ARE DOWN A LOT!

<review>Pretty good campground, although fairly open.  The staff were quite helpful, and regularly made rounds to clean the washrooms which is much appreciated.  Not as nice as some of the campgrounds we've stayed in (you need to take your own soap or hand sanitizer to the washroom) but overall pretty clean.  Fire pits and picnic tables on each site were well used but nice and solid.  Lots of owl activity at night, and birds during the day with a few monarch butterflies flitting through and with it being not too far from the beach it was a nice escape to nature for the weekend.  I would stay here again, but definitely bring something freestanding for shade in the summer.</review>< pictures>

Its like this place is run by FEMA. Overcrowded spaces, horrible bathrooms that are prison like and filthy most of the time. The rangers are big whimps and don't enforce the parks quiet time rules, or the maximum number of vehicles or people allowed on any one campsite. Because of the blatant over crowding the bathrooms become completely blown up and in many cases non operable. They only clean and stock the bathrooms once daily. Its a horrible, dirty, disgusting place with wet floors and clogged toilets and sinks! If I could give minus 10 stars it still wouldn't be low enough.
The entire grounds are covered in fox tails. There is no sign of any sort of grounds maintenance or weed control around the actual camp sites.  This place should be sold and privatized so that the  over due maintenance and overall park  cleanup could be done.
What a shitbox!!!<//Text>

The campgrounds was ok, but I felt picked on by the rangers. Bought a generator from camping world and they said it was to loud. Yet they let some people ran they're generators before and after hours. Some things not right.</Review>

<text>We arrived at nighttime, easily found our spot #103, set up our tent, gathered our towels and toiletries to go take a shower.  I was dismayed to find that we had to pay for a shower.  Especially since we payed $43 for a tent site that was nothing more than a powder dirt pad, that clearly had not been groomed in ages. There was also residual dirty underwear lying on the floor of said shower.  There were weeds everywhere.  The site we had was really close to other tent sites as well.  There was roughly 15 feet between our tent and the others.  So, long story longer, we never were able to shower as we werent aware of the token needed.  We then went to the restroom, and were horrified. It wreaked of stale urine, the toilet didn't flush, and it had the appearance that if you walked in, you'd contract multiple infections, aka, a cesspool of bacteria.  There was wadded up toiletpaper that had the appearance of pranksters wetting it, to create massive spit wads, that were splattered on the ceiling of the bathroom.  They'd been there awhile, it was obvious.  Some suggestions:  When your campground is full, and you're charging tokens to shower, utilize those funds to provide hourly rounds to check cleanliness and debris pickup.  Disinfect your bathrooms, take a hammer and chisel, and remove the cement like spit wads from the ceiling.  I can see where this campground might be appealing, especially if you have your own camper (which we unfortunately werent able to bring ours do to distance), as you can use your own facilities.  There are alot of majestic trees, with a beautiful golf course nearby, not to mention the coast line.  We were highly disappointed given the cost of our "dirt pad", which is normally what you'd pay for a full hookup RV spot.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Needs a little tlc.Tokens for showers now not a good thing, the machines to get the tokens are out a lot of the time and you have to have small bills for them. Half the bathrooms are out of service and showers. Full just about every night a120 spaces where does all the money go if not back into the park for repairs?( Still nice)<//Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><time>1522120103159<//time><Resp>None< /Resp><Review>It can be very crowded and tightly packed with noisy, unsupervised younglings, but it always has some stunning vistas.
It can be quite chilly waiting for the campgrounds shower water to warm up, but if you thought ahead and brought more than enough shower tokens into the shower room with you, that shower can be renewing.
Now, regarding proximity, this Park is very conveniently placed within a short drive to a whole lotta good places to visit: Morro Rock, the MB Embarcadero, to Los Osos and the Grocery Outlet there, to an indoor theater in MB, and to a drive-in theater in San Luis Obispo, to The Brickhouse BBQ restaurant on Main St. in MB, to Albertsons grocery store, to Morro Bay Propane & Moving, and to the Mobil Station on MB Blvd. for good prices on 22oz. craft beers.
But whatever you do while here, don't pass up your opportunity to rent a kayak at the marina across from the park. It's inexpensive, low impact, easy rowing exercise that even old people can enjoy. And wear a coat, it's Always cold on the water here.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80ece3d1daa29209:0x6d14a7ae46d3ba9</Gmap_id><UserId.>105534322592561887458<//UserId.>< pics>

The only good thing about this place is the showers get hot. The camp sites are right on top of each other (about 8 feet). There's no brush or shrubbery in between them so absolutely no privacy. I was awoken by someone snoring several times and once by a fart! Stay away from this place, it was the worst camping experience I've ever had.< /Text>

Yeah it’s gorgeous but she slept to the soft putter patter of pooping bats and birds- tent was covered in the morning- and it’s mesh ☹️<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
This campground has very small campsites, very close together. We had a hard time sleeping due to neighbor noises just because the tents were so close together. The campground is very close to the beach, we were the only ones at the beach when we went. The air is very wet in the morning, anything left out, and the tent were soaking wet.</Review>

Very green, roomy non-hookup campsites, there are pull-thru hookup sites, next to Morro Bay Golf Course,  beautiful area.< /Review>

Right across street from a harbor and next to a golf course. Very nice "suburban" campground. Worth the price because of the location about three miles away from the downtown Morro Bay area. A trolley runs there in the summer (starts roughly late May / Memorial Day) park has wifi, works decently when I tested it. Not a ton of privacy and mostly frequented by RVers. Some tent sites have shade, otherwise sites are in rows out in the open. Some sites have views of harbor. Yeah it's expensive but the people with the $200K RVs don't seem to mind, I suspect this campground is generally free of rowdies and homeless types because of / justifying the cost. The presence of CA State Park law enforcement types keeps this and Montana D Oro relatively pest free :)<//text>
