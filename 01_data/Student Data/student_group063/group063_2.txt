<review>Only place in a 3 hour radius to get me the tires I wanted. They gave me a good deal and a warranty. Can't ask for anything else. Very knowledgeable and patient sat down with me to get rims to match. Also installed a 4in rough country lift.

There are so many tire shops in lodi and after talking to a few of them I'm happy I ended up here. The employees are super friendly and actually knew what they were talking about, got a great deal on a new set of tires and had my front struts replaced. The Toyota dealership wanted a fortune and I saved a ton by coming here. They weren't busy and I was in and out quicker than I expected. Friendly people and great service.< /Text>

I had a wobble in my tires over 65 mph and I wasn't sure if it was just balancing or what it was. I brought it into these guys Adam and Abe were very helpful and professional. They were able to address my issue in a very quick manner, the price was fair and the service was great. They provide services for suspension alignment and tires and rims. I would recommend them any day.<//Text>

<text>This place is the best! Adam who works there was super super helpful!! I was dealing with a bunch of run around from AAA on trying to get my RV tires fixed... it took over a week and in the end AAA didn’t get the job done, Adam at Dave’s shop did. He turned my frustrating AAA experience into a helpful process through great communication, helping find solutions, and really caring about the customer, not too mention, super fast and efficient too!</text>< Time>

I was looking for used tires to use temporarily until I had my suspension repaired next week. A young man came out and told me they have 245/45/20 that would fit the front of my car, I told them I'm not sure if that would fit. They guaranteed it would.
Here's where it gets pretty scary
They told me it would be 160 dollars.
I've never paid more than 35 to 40 dollars for a used tire.
I asked to see what tires they were planing on selling me.
They rolled them out and I was offended. The front tires were around 3 or 4/32nds of tread left The rear was offensive. It probably had 1 or 2/32nds of tread left.
I told them I am not okay with these tires. They rolled out new ones that had slightly more tread.
But then preceded to tell me these cost more valued at 170!
At this point I'm blown away. They started telling me I had to pay disposal fees if I use my bank card but if I pay cash I would not have to pay them.
Unbelievable.
I've never paid disposal fees on any used tire. Ever.
They changed their price after I started to walk away to 140 even. I said fine because I had to leave to Vegas that night and my time was running thin.
Now it gets even worse.
I drove home and I was getting all kinds of dashboard lights on my car. So I get out and inspect the tires.
MY STRUTS WERE RESTING ON TOP OF THE TIRE. THEY NEVER TOLD ME IT THEY DONT ACTUALLY FIT. NOW IM HAVING A TON OF ISSUES. I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM THIS SO THEY SAID I HAD TO PAY MORE TO SWITCH IT TO THE TIRE SIZE I ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR!!!  NOT TO MENTION THEY PUT MY DIRECTIONAL TIRE ON BACKWARDS!!!
NOW I AM HAVING ALL SHORTS OF ISSUES WITH MY CAR AFTER GETTING MY TIRES INSTALLED HERE. THIS WAS THE ONLY TIRE SHOP I HAD SHOPPED AT THAT MADE ME SIGN A WAIVER WHEN I PURCHASED FROM THEM. If they make you sign a waiver you should be concerned for you safety..
I'm not happy about this.</Review><Date>1589671159776<//Date></record></dataset><record>

Conflicted in my review. Staff was great but to get a price for what I want is hard. Had called, told me they would call me back. They texted. Sent pictures of what I want. After giving me several prices, they said it would be better if I took my truck in. I did. Again told them what I want and said they would call me with a price. Gentleman was helpful and nice there. But I still have not received a price. Going somewhere else.< /review>

Bad service and poor work ethic. After replacing our front ends steering and suspension components on a company vehicle we took it  into David's tires on Friday to have an alignment done to not only ensure the alignment was done properly and the vehicle was safe to drive but to also support local small businesses being we are a local small business ourselves. Over the weekend there were some loud noises coming from the front end and the steering wheel became off center. When we brought the truck back theywere very short about the whole situation and refused to address the issue saying "we didn't touch anything on that side of the truck" this was clearly an alignment issue. Now after years of service we will no longer be returning to David's tires . Were currently at les schwaabb and they will be our new gk to guys.<//text>

Let me start with this place is awesome with some great guys. They really went beyond what they do to make sure I was happy. I did my 2020 tundra 7” lift with 37” wheels and tires. The truck looks amazing. They even washed my truck for free just as courtesy. Great guys! Great shops! Definitely my place to go to if I need any work done on my truck. Thank you Dave!</review>

<text>I thank GOD for these guys. They have saved me on numerous occasions. I have no problem driving all the way from Elk Grove to them because they are IMO by far the most knowledgeable and honest tire shop I've ever dealt with. Now that they are doing alignment and breaks they are my one stop shop. I would highly recommend them to anyone.< /text><Rate>5<//Rate><date>1603238068940</date>< username>

I typically don’t write reviews for tire shops but this place really took care of all my cars needs. Not only did they get me reliable tires; they were the best price out there and best quality as well. While I was there I seen they work on things other than tires and hooked up a lifted tundra truck. Will be bringing all my cars here for all my car needs.< /review>

<date>1596850529752</date><Text>I recently visited David’s Quality tire because my back two tires were completely bald and wires were showing. They checked out the front tires and to be honest I thought like anyone else would at a car place they’d tell me i needed new ones but they didn’t they were up front and honest and told me that I could rotate those to the back. They then made sure I had a nice alignment so that it wouldn’t happen again. As I was leaving they heard my brakes squeaking which was an annoying problem I was having and they gave me a really competitive quote to have them replaced. I came back a few days later when my brakes came in and again was greeted by Abed and he was really cool and made sure that I was taken care of properly. His dad did my brakes and I haven’t had an issue with them squeaking since. They have definitely gained a lifetime customer for all of my car needs.< /Text><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

The new owners of David‘s Tire Shop had the 13 inch tires that we needed, and couldn’t find anywhere else.   They were polite, friendly,  honest, and incredibly helpful.  The price was reasonable and they guaranteed their product and work.< /Text>

Had a blow out on my car looked up for a place close by found David’s tires. They had multiple choices for new and used which other shops I’ve been to in Lodi Barely have any. The guys who helped me were very kind and respectful. Got a killer deal on some new tires and brakes. Will Definitely definitely be coming here for any of my tire needs and recommend them to anyone who needs anything tire related. One thing forget to mention that I liked that they were very honest and upfront about what they were selling. They show you everything not like other shady shops in Lodi. Best place in town I repeat don’t go anywhere else< /Text>

You are the one that should be educating customers not the other way around.
I did not specifically request that size. I asked the employees if it would fit and they guaranteed it would fit. I believe the gentlemens name was Adam  he kept telling me how much extra space I have in my wheel well
When I got home my struts were resting on the tire and according to davids tire and wheel, that fits? also incorrect, A1 makes me sign no waiver, Firestone, America's tire, Bridgestone  all no waiver
ive read the fine print on yours the fine print that doesn't exist on any other shops receipts . Because they know they are going to do it right with the customers safety being the number one concern. And if they do something wrong they are ready to deal with the ramifications to make it right.
Not to mention I dont know How can you even justify your crew putting a DIRECTIONAL tire on BACKWARDS,  you simply just look at an arrow to on the outside of the tire to know to which way it goes on. Complete disregard. THESE ARE PEOPLES LIVES YOU ARE PLAYING WITH.
Not to mention I had to have both of the front tires you sold me repaired the next day because they both had leaks!<//Review>

Don't know why I wasted my time driving with a way out to the shop to get a set a used truck tires they were pretty bald to begin with but I needed something quick got home tried to mount them and there was a few nails in the tires that I didn't see, That part is my fault but why when I called him and told him about it he said just bring them back and he'll refund me... Seems to me that he knew that they were in there and he should have never sold the tires to begin with.</review>

BEWARE - Using these guys is a gamble..These guys sold me a used tired that went flat because of a nail - not their fault.  I couldn't get the tire off using a 130lb torque wrench because the lug nuts were on there so tight - their fault.  When I towed it to David's, they told me they weren't responsible and couldn't help me in Lodi but I could have it towed to another one of their garbage dump shops in Elk Grove where they could chisel it off.  I can do that on my own!   Not to mention that during a previous experience I showed up at 4:40pm because the other used tire they sold me wouldn't hold air and he said I'd have to come back tomorrow!  I drove to and from Tracy that night having to stop and put air in the tire.  The next morning - you guessed it!  They told me the tire was no good, didn't have a warranty and had to be replaced!  I immediately took the vehicle to Pep Boys and bought new tires there because I was so p****d...It's my own fault for going after a good price but hopefully someone else will learn from my mistakes. This is the second shop that I've had shady issues with and there just certain people that should be avoided when getting automotive work done.  I'd been going there for years and none of that mattered.  Nickel and dime con-artists that won't get another dime from me...< /review>

We were given a gift card to Heavenly Freeze and tried it out today. They have a good assortment of ice cream, Italian ice, and sweet drinks. The Italian ice my daughter got was my favorite - I’ll be getting that next time!<//review>

I was in the mood for something sweet, so I came here for the first time. I had no idea what to get, the owner was very helpful with suggesting popular items & flavors. I got the “heavenly combo” a good mixture of self serve vanilla ice cream, & Italian ice cream of your choice. 11/10 recommend this place. The ice cream is very satisfying & not overwhelming with sweetness. This is definitely going to be my new go-to place for my sweet fix. Would give more stars if possible.< /review>

Amazing Italian ice.  Honeydew is the best! The boba tea is also very good. The Taro one is definitely a favorite.  Can't wait to try matcha next time.  Customer service is 10/10.
Can't wait to go back.<//review>

<review>Second time coming in! First time, I got a Concrete with soft served vanilla ice cream, chocolate chips, and peanut butter cups.. it tasted like horchata.. I don’t know how to describe it, but just know IT WAS THE BEST SOFT SERVE I HAVE EVER HAD, and soft served is my absolute FAVORITE! This second time, I went with the Italian Ice option, when I tell you that it is 10000xs better then Rita’s Ice, you can’t even compare it to this, THAT’S HOW AMAZING THIS IS! I got mango and peach, the portions were HUGE!!

I am not affiliated with Heavenly Freeze, I do not work nor own. I decided to post this because it’s not everyday you find an AMAZING small ice cream shop that is actually really good and well priced. I will be coming again, next time I think I’ll try the famed Heavenly Freeze, half-soft served, half-Italian ice!< /review>< Pics>

<text>When the kids deserve a treat,  or mom is just craving the best ice cream around, this is our go to spot. I always change me flavor so I can try them all, but it's always served with vanilla soft serve. The kids love the blue drink. The owner is super nice. Definitely our favorite Ice cream place!!!</text><user>118370816072083797240<//user>< rate>

Heavenly Freeze is the BEST!!! I’ve had it 3 times now and it never disappoints. Super delicious and yummy. The Owners and employees have the best service. They are so loving and caring for their customers. I also bought a shirt because I want to help get the word out. Can’t wait to go back again</Review>

Heavenly freeze is a great addition to our area!
The owner is a really nice guy and values ALL input - good or bad(not that we've come up with one). I first saw their truck this summer visiting the local food truck stops and one day coming home, i see their truck! I was super ecstatic to know they were having their brick & mortar spot right by where we live.
We've gone multiples times since they've opened and we've always had a great experience.
My favorite flavor is watermelon. On the hot summer days it had the right amount of sweetness and cold that just hit right.  My kids ALWAYS order blue raspberry.. and my husband gets cherry & lime.
We have tried other flavors and combos, but this is what we always come back to.
I'm still waiting on that sugar free flavor Issac!

Oh and while youre there. Grab a cookie to go! They make them in house. So yummy.</text>

<text>Heard about this place shortly after they opened a few months ago. My girls like it and my youngest can’t get enough. The flavors are great and the employees are courteous. They also give generous portions. It’s getting cold, but it’s still worth it. Definitely have to stop by whenever we’re in the area 👍🏽👍🏽< /text>< user_id>

Heavenly Freeze is now probably my FAVORITE ice scream stop! We first tried it as a food truck and was blown away by the deliciousness of both the ice cream and the Italian ice! Jump forward a couple of months, and they opened up their store just down the street from my job!
They have a great selection of flavors, and my favorite part is I get to combine my options! I like to pick out a scoop of ice cream with some of their soft serve ice cream. By the way- BEST SOFT SERVE IVE EVER HAD!  My husband likes to the heavenly combo, which is soft serve and Italian ice. Their prices are incredibly affordable and the staff has always been kind when we stop by.< /text>

Corny pun alert*** This place is truly HEAVENLY 🙌.  Honestly, best ice cream in the valley.  Smooth, creamy, toppings MANIA.... it's truly wild! I would recommend to all friends and visitors passing by. No cap, this place is great and David is the man to ask for. Just ordered a freshly handmade batch of unicorn ice cream and topped off with oreo overload. Great price, excellent service, don't settle for 2 scoops, get the quart! They're even on Doordash. Get it delivered on rainy days like this.<//review>

If you want frozen sweets, just put some sugar in milk and freeze it. But if you want real ice cream, come to Heavenly Freeze. Other shops cater to pedestrian tastes, but this place is for the true connoisseur of frozen dairy confections. Also, the owner Isaac is real cool cat!< /Text>

We hired Heavenly Freeze to come out to my son’s 13th birthday “party” and it couldn’t have been more perfect! Easy, peasy...lemon squeezie! Isaac rolled up in his cool truck, parked and served up the delicious treats to all of our guests.

We had previously tried Heavenly Freeze, so we knew how good it was. Most of our guests had not tried them out and were thoroughly impressed. Generous servings, and plenty of variety made for lots of happy guests.

I highly recommend Heavenly Freeze for parties and events of all ages!< /text>

Hello Central Valley! Just want to let you know that we picked up a Concrete sprinkle Ice cream, a cookie sandwich and an Italian ice this afternoon, and I have to tell you the service and ice cream: TOP NOTCH! 😋🙌🏼

Sólo quiero compartir que hace un rato, fuimos por unos cuantos helados incluyendo postre de hielo Italiano. ¡Se los recomiendo ampliamente! ¡El servicio, al igual que el helado son de primera categoría! 😋🙌🏼<//Text>

<Text>I grew up In the food industry. My family had taco trucks and a Restaurant. This food is by far the closest thing to the authentic Mexican food I’m  accustomed to. The burritos/ tacos / tortas are always packed with food. You won’t find a skinny burrito at Adelitas..<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80ea6ab6decea365:0xa35a2e590afc7982<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

By far my favorite tacos. The tripas are cooked perfectly. The salsa in amazing.
My only complaint is the lady sometimes charges me for salsa. I tip then she charges me after tiping. I would have just gave her the tip rather than putting it in the jar. She only charges me sometimes. No one else charges me besides this lady.</review>

< Review>
Luis and Fernando were incredibly professional and worked quickly and thoroughly. They took great care to protect my hardwood floors, and Luis was very helpful in answering all of my questions. I’m very, VERY pleased with the results and recommend them highly. And I’ve already referred them to a friend who has some pet stains on her oriental carpets. I will definitely bring the Lewis team back to power wash my front walkway and back patio.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Luis Torres arrived on time with a smile on his face. He quickly set up his equipment and began the job of cleaning my dirty carpets. He helped me move a couple of heavy things that I was unable to move when I was preparing for him. He was patient and willingly cleaned areas that I asked him to go over again.   He skillfully cleaned corners and areas that are difficult to access. He asked me several times to access the work he had done.   Luis Torres is an asset to his company, Lewis Floor Care Company.  I recommend them. They are thorough and professional.   Mary Rodriguez</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners is simply the best. With their work ethic, professionalism, and superior work quality, I wish I had more jobs for them, just for the positive experience! Service companies can be disappointing and often over-charge, but Lewis does what they say they will do for the price they state and you can trust them completely.</Review>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners was fantastic to work with. They were prompt, on-time, very communicative, easy to talk with and coordinate with, and overall did a great job throughout the process. Luis Pena was our main contact and he was gracious, kind, warm and very professional. Very happy with our services!<//Review>

<Review>I have used Lewis twice to clean the common area stairs and landings in our building. Both times they were professional, on time, easy to book, and, most importantly, did a fantastic job. There were significant pet stains on one of the landings and they were able to remove the stains and deodorize the carpet. I will absolutely use them again!< /Review></record>

The crew was extremely polite, respectful, professional and hard working. They listened and followed through with all my special requests. This is the 4th carpet upholstry cleaning Lewis Carpet Cleaners performed for us, we are more impressed each time and we highly recommend this business. I sent out 4 rugs to their shop to be cleaned, they cleaned it and delivered on time. There was a minor stain removing with one of the silk rugs, when reported Lewis Carpet took care of it within 24 hours. Thank you Lewis Carpet Cleaners team.< /text>

<Text>Edits:
I initially gave a 2-star rating based on the original review below. Rick from Lewis Carpet Cleaners called and explained that they do not recommend removing the couch covers as they may shrink. The one spot that got left behind was most likely permanent as our couch had a lot of stains. Given how responsive and diligent the organization is, I am conferring the benefit of doubt and giving them 4-stars rather than take their rating down.

Original Review:
I loved the responsiveness and eagerness to help. They even gave me great instructions to clean the couch pillows and gave me a bottle of their cleaner liquid. They are priced very reasonably and offer honest estimates.

But, I had requested the team to take out the couch cover and separate from the sponge prior to cleaning it. I made this request 3 times:
1) Once with the cleaners when they came to our house.
2) When I dropped off the couch at the cleaners.
3) Reminder again via phone.
When the couch was returned it still had a bad spot as is since they did not follow the instructions. As much as I love their company ethos, this is poor quality work.<//Text>< Pictures>

<name>Kristi Shinnick<//name><Text>Such a great experience!  I was in need of a basic cleaning of my carpets in addition to a deep cleaning of an area with some pretty bad pet stains. It started with a brief phone consultation, an appointment made for the following day, a free in home estimate, and the job completely done....all in less than 24 hours!!  From the very first phone call, everyone was helpful and friendly and really made it easy for me. The scheduling was quick and easy, communication was great, and they arrived promptly in the allotted time frame. My carpet was pulled up in the deeply affected area and thoroughly examined and they showed me the spots where they recommended the pad be replaced. The pet damage was worse than what I originally thought, yet they were still able to thoroughly deep clean both sides of the carpet and replace the pad, along with doing the basic carpet cleaning in the remainder of my apartment. Everything was put back together nicely and they were in and out in just a couple of hours! Everything looks great, smells clean, and I would definitely recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaners.  Not only would I use them again for my variety cleaning needs, but I will also be scheduling a future appointment to have my furniture cleaned as well.<//Text>< time>

<review>Poor communication resulting in a waste of time.

After reviewing all details on the website and app, I had two calls with them to schedule my job and we went over what was needed: which was a simple clean of my 2 bedroom apartment before moving out. The day off the scheduled service I go down to meet the person and he says he’s there to give me an estimate?!

First I was annoyed because he showed up at 2:15pm for a 1pm appointment and at the end of it quoted me $250 when the lady on the phone quoted me 55c per sq foot for a minimum 250 sq ft. Totally wasted my time as they could have sent me a quote by email instead of having me wait a few days then a few hours the day off to get basic information down. Wouldn’t recommend.

Update: after all this I was easily able to find another company that cleaned my carpets for $150. They sent me a quote by email and arrived on time.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1591305540786, 'text': 'Hi Abhi,\nSorry I missed you when I called you about your service experience .

I had my white sofa and club chairs cleaned today. The team came in (with booties on which I appreciated) and thoroughly cleaned all of the cushions and the main part of the sofa and chairs. They look so clean and fresh now! After cleaning they turned some blowers on so that the material would dry more quickly (which worked!) Lewis Carpet Cleaners did an excellent job. I have had rugs and other pieces of furniture cleaned by them in the past and will continue to use their services in the future. They are both professional and reasonably priced.<//Text>

I've always been happy with the quality and service Lewis provides. Our latest experience is an example: our rugs were back within a few days, beautifully cleaned and looking like new.

<review>So happy with the job they did for me today.  They were on time, very personable, and the price was reasonable. I wanted to make sure the carpet was "green" for a visit by my grandson.  When they found a sticky spot that required chemicals, they gave me the choice of the chemicals or the spot.  I appreciated that!  I've already recommended them to a friend.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Both gentlemen not friendly when we opened the door to greet them. Didn’t say anything just measured the furniture and quoted us way more than what was provided over the phone with exact measurements of the furniture. Asked us to sign the order without explaining anything. Did not offer the scotch guard or other products for after care. Unfortunately, these gentlemen are reflective of the company so I am disappointed in the service.<//Review>< resp>

Luis, the technician, is just so kind, hardworking and trustworthy where I know I’m not getting ripped off.  We’ve used Lewis Carpet Cleaners twice now and both times have been not only great experiences, but they sure know how to get the job done right.  Their pricing is very reasonable, as well.  Luis was prompt within the time window where I’ve had some technicians come hours past their promised window times with another company (won’t mention who). I highly recommend them for your carpet/rug cleaning needs.</text>

We engaged your service to strip and wax a 700 square foot vinyl floor. Your expert helpers arrived right on time at 9:00, provided an estimate and got to work. They moved the furniture out and in and did a fabulous job on the floor. It looks as good as the day it was installed - 35 years ago. We highly recommend your service.<//text>

Luis Pena did an exceptional job on carpets and furniture today. Little wonder this fine company has such a following with favorable comments and five star ratings. It’s truly remarkable to see a dedicated professional go about his job with so much attention to detail. And oh, did I mention super customer service???

My experience was ok I guess, due to the fact that my trunk was shampooed. I just didn't understand why I was given such a high fee such as 180.00$ just for the back trunk of my Tahoe. Its a rough time with the Covid 19, so you can just imagine how most of our funds are suffering. So much for helping Lewis cleaners right, but in return I feel like that wasn't helpful at all. Thanks for showing how your company shows great customer service. Never again! Stanley steemers all the way!!!!< /Text>

We have been using Lewis Carpet Cleaners ever since we moved into our home. They come once a year and make our carpets look like new— which is no small feat with white carpet that has been effected by two toddlers and a dog!

Always my go to carpet cleaning company.
I’ve been going to Lewis Carpet Cleaners for years and know when I call Rick it gets be booked right away. This time he sent Luis  and he did a fabulous job. I’ve tried Coit  ( in El Dorado Hills)and just never got  my carpets cleaned wish Lewis was up there too. If you need your carpets cleaned I wouldn’t hesitate to call Lewis Carpet Cleaners.</Review>

Lewis Cleaners did an excellent job cleaning our white couch.  They texted me with updates on their arrival, showed up on time, and stayed much longer than I expected making sure they cleaned everything really well.  I'll definitely use them again.< /Text>

I have used Lewis Carpet Cleaners for several years and think they are outstanding.  I have a large long-haired dog and two elderly cats (who have accidents sometimes) and I am always astounded at their ability to return the cream rugs to "like new".  They definitely do a superior job to other companies I used in the house.  And they are a pleasure to work with.<//Text>

They did a fantastic job on our old ass carpet in our rental house. Juan was right on time and super nice. They use a combination of light agitation and a truck mounted extraction system which pulled almost all the water and grime out. They were completely dry in about 2 hours (65 deg outside). I didn't expect half of the results we got on these 10+ year old carpet. I will be using them from now on</text>

After the cleaning, there was a cat accident and they came back out to re-clean at no charge on Saturday afternoon.  I'm always impressed with the quality of service, value and most importantly the timeliness of Lewis Carpet.  If you need a partner in carpet care you'd be well served to consider Lewis Carpets.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I had a positive experience from beginning to end with Lewis Carpet Cleaners.  They are professional, efficient, courteous, do a great job, clean workers, diligent workers, careful workers, considerate workers and go the extra mile.  I've had different carpet cleaning companies, but this experience far surpasses any past experience.  I highly recommend them.  You won't be disappointed!< /Text>

That was a little disappointing, as we could do more frequently if better priced.  Techs were nice enough.  But were about 40 minutes late - no text ( not sure if they called - too many robocalls so I rely on text )   But - i have a clean carpet today .< /review><user>104524851517145814410<//user>< time>

<Text>Lewis Carpet Cleaners was amazing! From the professional person who scheduled the appointment, to the very experienced gentleman that came and cleaned our 2 linen /cotton sofas. They were confident that they could clean the sofas well vs the other competitors that did not have the right tools to clean linen/ cotton sofas. My two sofas are like brand new! Thank you!< /Text>< pics>

Highly recommend Lewis Carpet cleaners!  They have been cleaning my area rugs and wall to wall carpets for years and always do a great job!  Last year they did an excellent job cleaning very soiled leather kitchen chairs.    I was having my hand woven wool Persian runners cleaned at a special cleaners and I recently began using Lewis for them as well and the runners have never had such vibrant colors!  The technicians are professional and very thorough.  Lewis is the ONLY place for carpet and upholstery cleaning!</text>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners does much, much more than clean carpets.  They restored the gleam to our slate bathroom floor, cleaned and stretched carpet in a vacated office, removed kitty odor from a carpet, etc., etc., etc.

They have a heart:  We got to know Lewis Carpet Cleaners when they volunteered their services to Rebuilding Together Peninsula, an organization that rehabilitates and makes homes safe and clean for older individuals on the Peninsula.

Call them, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

Great service.  Arrived on time.  My 8-yr-old carpets look like new!  Cleanup was efficient - and green (put water directly into sewer line).  Highly recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaners.</Text>

<name>Leigh Soutter<//name><Review>10 stars!  I thought we would need to replace our carpets but thought we might try to clean them.  It was a back to back rental and Renatta at Lewis worked with me to get our place cleaned on OUR time (even when they themselves were super busy).  I can't thank her enough. Plus our carpets look terrific.   Highly recommend.</Review>< Pictures>

They have gone out of their way to help us with  various problems  we've had – often at no extra charge.

The guys were awesome.  Very nice and helpful at explaining what was happening with my carpet.  Our off-white carpet looks fresh and new, and any stains previously there are gone.  It dried in less than 24 hours, even in the rainy weather.  I will be using them again.!</text>

The BEST!!!!   I have used Lewis Carpet both personally and professionally for many years.  You will not find anyone else that will make your Carpets sparkle the way they do.  I have also used them for Marble Polishing and carpet stretching.   Don't hesitate..........Use them ..you will not by disappointed.

HOLY MOLY. Lewis Carpet Cleaners did SUCH an amazing job! They were super responsive when I gave them a call and welcomed me "to the family". Such great customer service!

I live in a 2 bedroom apartment on a commercial block of San Francisco, and they found parking without complaint and brought their gear in. After about 2 hours, it was like night turned to day. I didn't even know I was in the same apartment (and yes, it was that gross before). Spick and span -- the absolute best experience. I would not only call them again, but I've already told all my friends. Best carpet cleaners ever!</Text>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners is the best company to do business with.
My recent visit was to clean my heating ducts...and the registers.
Next, I will have my upholstery and carpet cleaned.  I have used their
services for about 15 years and they have always been professional
along with their excellent service.</text>

Lewis Carpet Cleaners are more expensive and do not accept competitor coupons. They did a good job and were quick. Becasue they were so efficient I could continue with my day. They protected the furniture.

We were delighted with their work on our tile floors.  The grout hasn't looked this good since the tile was laid 20 years ago.  We plan to use them again to clean our hardwood floors.

Had really good experience. Carpet came out in great condition (cleaned on both sides), and was ready to pick up a few days before they said it's going to be ready.</Text>

Lewis Cleaners has never let me down. This is why I use them throughout multiple properties and for various types of floors. Be it carpet, hardwood, vinyl they have always approached each job with care a dedication no matter the size of the job. I've even used them for rubber flooring. I value the fact that they are always willing to work with me on scheduling, regardless of how ridiculous the time restraints are.<//text>

Anyone looking for a quality carpet cleaning business - do not hesitate to call Lewis Cleaners!   I was looking for a dry chemical company because I was tired of walking around with wet socks for 2 days... I found a company but after explaining about the stains they referred me to Lewis Cleaners.

I used Coit and was never satisfied - removed stains but 2 days after the carpet finally dried - stains came back.

Adrian and Juan were very professional and explained the entire process to me, they were even able to get out a stain from red wine.

Excellent service!!<//text>

From the person who answered the phone (Renata) to the gentlemen who came and did the work (Adrian, Fernando, Jonathan, and others) it was an excellent experience.  The recent rains caused a flood that did a lot damage and caused a terrible odor in our home.  Lewis Carpet Cleaners came out a few different times, worked around our work schedules and took care of our problem.  They really know what they are doing!!!  Can't say enough.  I definitely would recommend them.</review>

<Text>We have used Lewis Carpet Cleaners a number of times in the past and have been very satisfied.  This last time was a bit different.  We have new carpet that is almost 2 years old. We were scheduled for late afternoon one Friday and the cleaner techs called and said they could come earlier, which was great for me. It was around noon and I suspect, given their surprise at the size of the area, that they weren't so pleased and that maybe they would miss their lunch (just surmising here).  We offered them sodas and water, which they refused.  They were nice enough, but there were a couple red flags.  1) I had called Lewis prior to the cleaning and told him we had 4 FLOR rugs (in addition to some wall-to-wall) to be cleaned and asked if they knew how to do that since they're a bit different from other area rugs.  He told me that FLOR had just indeed called him recently to see if they could refer people to Lewis for FLOR rug cleaning.  I told him I was pleased to know that there would be knowledgeable people cleaning our rugs.  Well, when the tech guys got here, they had no idea what FLOR rugs were.  To their credit, they dug up some plastic tarps from their truck to put under the rugs in case anything leaked through to the engineered wood floor beneath.  They were very careful and all worked out well.  I had to print out the cleaning instructions from FLOR for the guys, but they didn't seem too interested.  Just glad it turned out okay.

2) When I approved the estimate, no other services were explained to me nor was I asked if there was anything else I wanted.  I assumed they would Scotch Guard at the end.  When they were nearly finished, we asked if they would Scotch Guard the carpets, they said they didn't have any in the truck.  ???!!!  The one man, who appeared to be the one in charge, said he was just filling in for someone and had to load the truck quickly that morning and must have forgotten to bring it. No offer was made to go get some.  It can only be done on damp carpets, so there was no way we could wait until the next week and have them come back and do it.

3)We felt that both guys were trying to finish their job asap, especially since they got to us earlier than expected, and were anxious to get off work early on a Friday, although they had one more house to go to after us. They also never left us any spot cleaner.  I only noticed the latter when we had Lewis come back a few weeks later and look at our stairs that still seemed to show dirt.  They did some tests and found it wasn't dirt or carbon emission deposits, and that it was probably just the shadows on the stairs.  We're still not sure about the stairs--but maybe it IS just shadows.They then asked if the cleaners had given us some of their spot cleaner and when we said no, they promptly gave us a bottle.

In sum, it all seemed a bit rushed, and sub-par for Lewis.  No ScothGuard?  Really?  No knowledge of FLOR even though I had stressed that?

I will use Lewis again, but if that time doesn't go better, Lewis is off my list.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fa25627a2d257:0x460d275834270a30</gmapID></record>

<Review>I a very happy with the job Lewis Carpet Cleaners did for me. My hot water heater flooded part of my family room creating quite a mess. Adrian Vazquez and his helper not only were very personable guys but they came promptly, cleaned the carpet, dried them with fans, and then came back to treat the subfloor, install a new pad, and restretched the carpet. I couldn't be happier.< /Review>< pics>

I was surprised how many stains were removed!!!They are PROFESSIONAL! The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they were late for an hour.......</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Two gentlemen texted me when they were on their way which I appreciated. They were very polite and knowledgeable. They suggested moving the rug to the driveway for cleaning which was a very good idea. Spots disappeared and they brought the rug back into the house and carefully placed it and the furniture that they had moved back into place with my approval. I always recommend Lewis Carpet Cleaning.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Absolutely wonderful!  They stock the widest range of fertilizers and ground coverings I have EVER seen!  Prices are very fair.   However the best aspect of this clearly long time established business was how kindly they treated me and ask if the other customers.    They clearly know their product and quickly offered a few suggestions to help fix my problem.    I was very impressed how they are ready to help a little grandma to a full truckload.    I will be back soon, and often!</Review>

The checkout counter is inside, but there's a gigantic garage-type door open, they are enforcing social distancing, and all the employees are wearing masks, so it feels pretty safe. Their selection and prices are amazing, and they sell things in bags, or by cubic yard. If you're going to get cubic yards of anything, bring a truck, or some very sturdy trash bags and tools to bag it yourself. They have gorilla hair mulch, every other kind of mulch imaginable, river rocks, gravel, topsoil, plus they do custom blends and can deliver. If you are doing any kind of real Landscaping, it's worth the trip.< /review>

<review>Great selection of materials. TERRIBLE customer service. I was "helped by an older gentleman named David, who it seems would rather be doing anything else other than helping customers. If I rolled my eyes like he did and mumble back at my customers as he did I'd soon be out of business. Place needs new blood or better management.< /review>< Pictures>

Good place to get what you need.  If you're too sensitive about the way people talk this place isn't for you. You're dealing with guys who know their business. You're not at church so don't expect the same atmosphere</Text>

Great staff didnt know what or how to use their services even though its pretty simple.. roundtrip ticket is better and last for 3 months meaning you can reuse it for later date.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgCLGlUxBhLlouM8Y4HoSLTT4GKvE2aYiR-tyk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1ZZWLxJcfRNBEo0A91rxeM2Klkuyll5GwXBQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

I got to the San Ysidro bus location at 4:00pm only to Be informed that the next bus towards Huntington Park would be at 8pm. This is frustrating and horrible customer service! Also, when I purchased tickets in Huntington Park, the workers never informed me about the new bus schedules here in San Ysidro. It is true what the other reviews say about this bus line, THEY LIE TO THE PEOPLE! The front desk workers here also have bad customer service, giggling to themselves when I was shocked to find out the next bus would arrive at 8pm. I won’t be selecting this bus line again.</text><rate>1<//rate>< Time>

My husband and I bought our tickets at the Tijuana airport. The representative there told us we would leave Tijuana airport at 6pm and cross the border then catch their other bus at 7p.m at San Ysidro office. But we actually left like at 6:15 p.m. from Tijuana airport. Then we crossed  the border within 5 minutes walking then we got to their San Ysidro office to catch the 7pm bus to find out at the office that there was no such 7pm bus. We had to wait for a bus til 9 p.m. If we would have know this we would of paid a little more and catched a different bus that actually left at 7p.m. The staff here at the San Ysidro office have no customer service and instead of being on their phones and talking to each other they should clean the waiting room at least a little also.</Review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

I have been a customer at this location for over 15yrs and am very sad at how the quality of customer service has gone down throughout the past couple of years. I have waited upto 3-4 hours on more then one situation. Therefore I have been forced to switch bus companies.</text>

(Translated by Google) In fact, they have not worked with their own fleet of trucks for many years and to fulfill their mission they rent units and the one that does not lack bathrooms, lacks air conditioning, lack of transportation to places such as: airport bus station and other places in Tijuana that at the end of the day, sometimes they even miss their flight and the only competition they have is the raiteros, for that reason it is the transport that we seek the most; I think they should check and / or regularize that transport company, I hope that will be the case in the future.

(Original)
De hecho ya tiene muchos años que no trabajan con flota de camiones propios y para cumplir con su cometido rentan unidades y la que no carece de baños, carece de aire acondicionado, falta de transportación a lugares como: central camionera aeropuerto y otros lugares en Tijuana que al fin de cuenta aveces hasta pierden su vuelo y la única competencia que tienen son los raiteros por eso es el transporte que procuramos más; creo que deben de checar y/o regularizar esa compañía de transporte, espero que a futuro así sea.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is good to travel, trucks are typical of buses for short or long trips, some more comfortable than others, it depends on the type of bus, the receptionist is friendly, but the central leaves a lot to be desired, there are not enough seats to wait and the Bath is mixed and paperless, there is also no place to change a baby.

(Original)
Esta bien para viajar, los camiones son tipicos de autobuses para viajes cortos o largos, algunos mas comodos que otros, depende del tipo de autobus, la recepcionista es amable, pero la central deja mucho que desear, no hay suficientes asientos para esperar y el baño es mixto y sin papel, tampoco hay lugar para cambiar a un bebe.<//Text>< Pics>

This Italian deli in San Francisco is beyond excellent. It is worth the time and effort it takes to drive from ANYWHERE in the Bay Area for their incredible selection of meats, cheeses, Italian specialties and customer service. Today I had a slice of their meatloaf and (2) Dolmas. Absolutely amazing. I am not kidding. Head to the city, get a sandwich or whatever your heart desires and then head to the park or the beach, eat and dream of heaven.< /Review>

< Review>
This is my first time there and I am completely satisfied. I was looking the soup set(fish head, bones and tail) to make a great plate for my family. I was asking this thing in a regular grocery stores such as lucky or Safeway and always got one answer - we are getting already prepared filet and no fish head etc. at all. But thanks a guy who actually works at lucky for the meat department for advicing me butcher store!!< /Review>

Super high quality deli butcher shop with a lot of Italian goods. Staff is extremely helpful with picking out cuts and recommendations. This is a hidden gem in the sunset. Unfortunately it took me 10 years to find it, like a moron. If you value your meats when grilling and old school real customer service, then make the drive.< /text>

It's my friends birthday in the park and they made each sandwich cut in half and wrapped each half separately for sharing. I've been ordering from here since I was a child and love their sandwiches, but I appreciate them going above and beyond during Covid19. I confirm ordering online with Chownow during covid helps them and you get what you need fast and accurately. I called to confirm this unusual order -Ben</text>

Wonderful neighborhood meat market,deli,and caterer.
Thanksgiving meal comes with  either ham or California grown Diestel free range turkey: juicy and  flavorful. Their own gravy, stuffy cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes round out the meal. Good tasting low sodium meal. Maybe I missed it, no pumpkin pie available.<//Text>

<text>I hate "reviewing" places but here we are.

I am a huge fan of this business and their staff, and today, I have another reason to feel this way.

I ordered a large amount of product via email with a manager and arrived for pick up to learn that, by mistake, it was not available. Mistakes happen, but the way they made it up to me was what impressed me: They took my number and address, drove out to buy my product (no small task), and then delivered it to my address by hand. "They don't drop the ball like this."

Danny Meyer said that "mistakes are opportunities for excellence," and I am happy to report on the grace with which this was handled. Full marks, and great product of course!<//text>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Guerra’s is a neighborhood staple. They actually have a really good produce, dairy, and bread selection, in addition to the obvious meat selection.
Ive never been one for pre-marinaded meat, but they do offer it here and it’s not bad. Otherwise they have an expansive selection of both cold cuts and raw uncured meat.

The one thing that isn’t largely advertised in the name are the incredible sandwiches. They aren’t necessarily cheap, but they are really, really good. It’s worth it, trust me.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Guerra's Meats is an amazing neighborhood asset.  This is the only place I go for meat, cheese, pate, and all of the other accoutrements necessary for a dinner party.  The service is great and the prices are reasonable.  They have the best quality that anyone could ask for.  Very highly recommended.< /Text>

I purchased 2 pounds of beef & paid for the price of 2 pounds of beef. There was only 1.5 pounds in fact.  They refused giving me back the half pound, even showing the receipt.  This is not the way doing business.....lack of integrity.  Never go there again.<//Text>

The quality of the meat is superb, the butchers are helpful and knowledgeable, and the prices are better than anything you'd get at a grocery store for the same quality. One butcher, Efrain has helped me with ideas for recipes, cooking tips, and always goes the extra mile trimming off excess fat or deboning a piece of meat upon request.

Bacon here is exceptional, the Salmon is amazing, and the beef is always high quality.

The quality of their meat makes for the best meals. You really can tell the difference. The people that work there are friendly and incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They'll quick to give you cooking instructions or recipes and always give me just the right amount for my party size.
The deli is also great and they have produce and other groceries and acme bread+. I love this place.</review>

This has become THE go-to place for meat whenever we are in town visiting family. From steaks to lamb chops to rib roasts to pork chops, everything is outstanding and clearly sourced with great care.

They also have a very nice selection of other goodies.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>This place deserves 5 stars for their great (in quality) cheese selection alone!!! They have a couple modestly sized shelves with some of the finest cheeses in California, and some international hits as well. I was so excited to find Cowgirl Creamery's Red Hawk among their selection!!

They also have pates and other great cheese accompaniments. :)

I have not tried any of the meat, seafood, or pasta (yet).< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>This place is the best! Great meat quality, customer service, and an overall friendly environment. It's nice to know there are smaller, local shops I can buy from instead of large supermarkets, and still get good prices.

They have an awesome assortment of meats, including fresh sausages, and cheeses to compliment. Guerra even stocks some produce basics to round off a great meal. I don't think I'll be buying meat anywhere else anytime soon.<//Review><user>112568987179973885230</user>< rating>

Everything I've gotten at the deli has been delicious!  It gets a little busy during the weekend lunch rush but if you go before or after, you should be fine.  The meatball sandwich and the chicken salad are fantastic.  The macaroni salad is perfect with not too much mayonnaise.  Pick up a few breakfast sausages for the next morning!< /Text>

This is not a complain about the food or the servive.  This is a complain about the way I can order food here. I wanted to order ten cold sandwiches for pickup.  No, can't do.  No online order anymore. The site pointed me to Guerra's-to-Go which has hot sandwiches and entrees. Okay, I am open to that possibility.  But orders are now routed through GrubHub which is expensive and has a much smaller and higher-priced menu.  Grubhub charges drivers tips (about 20%) and a deilivery fee (a smaller fee).  What a rip off!  I guess this is a plus for people whol ives farther away and  want delivery but is not conveneint for neighbors who could just walk to pick up.  Store closes at 7 or 6 (on weekends) so no luck trying to order after 6 on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  :-(<//review>

Went out to get their Tuesday special (Tri-TIp). Worst sandwich I've ever had. No condiments, just the au jus from the meat (too red) which made the ciabatta soggy. Lack luster lettuce and tomato, and no pickles! Took it back to my downtown office to enjoy, and was sorely disappointed. Would have taken it back if not so far to return it. Most of it ended up in the garbage. It was busy at the counter, but no excuse.< /text>

That said, the meats here are unmatched in the city.  This is where my grandmother has gone to get all her meats since 1960. If you haven't tried their Center Cut Corned Beef, you need to. It beats every Corned beef I have ever had both in the states and throughout Ireland.  Cook it for 4 hours on a low boil with the cabbage in for the last 4 minutes and let it set for 20 min. You will be hooked. I just ordered 20 pounds for St Pats.

The sausages are also amazing, straight spicy Italian style is my favorite.

All their meats are top notch and you can't go wrong.  Hope this helps.< /Review>< response>

A must if your anywhere near!
We stumble upon this cute authentic deli in San Franscio and fell in love. It's constantly busy strictly   for the fact that they have the most amazing sandwiches around! I loved there turkey and he bf  craves the roast.
They are also a full service butcher so they have tender cuts or meat you can purchase and take home to make your own creation.
We will be coming here and I'm spreading the word on this place<//text>

Fantastic butcher shop with a wide selection of meat, fish and deli items. There is also cheese, organic fruits and vegetables, bread, drinks even gelato. So you can pick up everything you need for an Italian family meal in this small shop. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive.</Review>

I bike half an hour out of my way on a regular basis just because the quality of the meat and prepared foods is so good here. It's like Bi-Rite for normal people prices. Get the Toscano Sandwich. Or any sandwich. The service is great too.</Review>

Great local mexican food! The owner is extremely nice and warm.  They are always willing to give you exactly what you ask for. I love this place and we order from here regularly.  The portions are big and the prices are very fair.  If you are in the area, stop by, you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Very cozy place with excellent food! The wait staff was wonderful! My husband and I were surprised that it wasn't packed. I think they need to dress up the outside a little too draw people in. Once you taste the good, though, you'll be hooked.< /Review>

Amazing, amazing food! The host/server is so kind and the service is fast.

The food is honestly quite impressive, authentic Mexican food done right. The price for quality is perfect, not too expensive and everything is so fresh!!

You've gotta try the fish tacos. blew my mind for sure.

There isn't a crazy drink selection or anything but the food is truly what shines here.</Review>

Small and fantastic. I had the carne asada tacos. They are enormous tacos made with thick, juicy pieces of tri-tip.

It comes with rice and beans, and they were pretty damn good too.

Chips and salsa were fresh. And I ordered a side of guacamole. Polished off every last bit.

Outdoor dining what's a bit cramped. diners were definitely sitting within six feet of each other. Otherwise, this would have been a five-star review.< /text>

Definitely our favorite Mexican restaurant in town. The guacamole is excellent! All the dishes are very generous with food. I can never eat it all. I highly recommend it.< /Review>

Be careful when ordering something off menu for kids. We were grossly overcharged. Our only kids meal turned out more expensive than our meals combined.< /Text>

Great food and great service. I had the burrito with red sauce which was amazing. Everything had great flavor and the chicken was super moist and tender. I would most definitely recommend Habaneros to others that are in the area.</Review>

We had 11 people in our party and most of us sat out in the patio area while others sat inside. The waitress (didn't get her name) was friendly and accommodated us as best as possible. We ordered the trio nachos, chicken enchiladas, cheese quesadilla, taquitos and all were delicious. Would definitely recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

<time>1566851802603< /time><Rate>4< /Rate><text>I had Barbacoa sandwich and mom had fish tacos. Fish was light and tasty. The batter was not heavy. It came with two sauces one was a habanero aioli which was pretty good and not to spicy, very mild. The other was a red sauce not sure what it was but definitely lacked flavor. The sandwich was very good and full of flavor. They used tri tip for the beef, very tender and juicy. I would definitely recommend this place for  the food I tried. I dont know about the other food because I didn't try it. I did see the guacamole and it look chunky and delicious although I did not try it where as most places it's watered down and running and not good this is not the case here.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>Friendly  service.  Salsa and  chips  came  from  a jar & bag. Beer not cold, salad  from a bag. Enchiladas  dry, my husband  didn't  like  his taco salad,  black beans  (not refried ), rice blah.   No  plans to go  back. But we did see others  receiving better  looking  food.</text>< pictures>

I don't believe I can do justice to the fantastic, authentic dining experience. Our party of 11 was accomodated with top level service and hospitality. The food was superb: wet burritos with Carne asada (red sauce was my choice), chicken (green sauce for the wife), and carnitas (green again for the MiL), fish tacos, chicken enchiladas... All superb. No doubt we will be back when possible.<//text>

<Review>A small place with big flavors: salsa with a sneaky hit of habanero, refreshing Margaritas (made with agave wine). We were a trio -- wife, her dad, me -- and all of our entrees were delicious: taquitos papas (potatoes -- who knew it would be so good??),  camarones de la diabla (medium spicy was just right) & Burrito Gordo for Daddy-o. A very welcoming place with warm, friendly service.</Review>< date>

Margaritas were so fresh and the queso fundito was the best I've ever had. We sat outside and our pup was allowed to sit at our feet! It's a small place but worth stopping in!!< /review>

<review>If you like cafeteria food, come here. The chips were stale, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. The tacos were decent, but the beans had a strange after taste. My son spit them out. And they are charging top dollar, $15 for 3 tacos.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I had the chimichanga and it was delicious. My husband had the torta and said it was really good as well. Everything was fresh and homemade. The review about the bag chips and bottled salsa is totally off base. And I thought the refried black beans were amazing. I highly recommend if you are ever in the area.< /text><rating>5< /rating></record>

This is the best authentic Mexican Food in a fun, but refined atmosphere. Everything is made in house and full of flavor.  The Cubano Torta, WOW!  Come when you have time to relax and enjoy. The portions are generous and prices fair. Mucho gusto!  Bueno savor.<//Text>

First place I have ever been that charged for Pico De Gallo (and it was a small shot glass size).

Chorizo Taco= overly salted and not spicy
Carne Asada taco= dry meat and under seasoned
Al pastor taco= no comment

Charged $7 for a children's portion of rice and beans for a 5 year old. The charge was lowered after talking to the lady who stated that she just added a regular "side." $3.50 for  a side of rice at a little taqueria is excessive in the first place.

Also a bean, rice, carne asada and cheese burrito ( as plain as it gets) =$9

I was hoping Paso Robles would have a decent taqueria but I was sorely mistaken.
Try other spots.

On a lighter note The 5 year old did finish the beans</Review>

If you're looking for customer service you're in the right place, Marlene was such a great help. I came in with a needle tension problem that two other shops couldn't help me figure out. I was prepared to look into buying a new sewing machine or been charged for replacement parts. Marlene sat me down and educated me on what was causing the issue and how to prevent it in the future. I really wish I could have paid her for her time and service, but she wouldn't accept. Next time I need supplies of any kind, I will continue to shop here.< /text>

Finally upgraded and got the Industrial sewing machine! Highly Recommend this place for all of your sewing and embroidery needs. Many new and used machines to choose from. I found joseph to be very helpful and willing to help me with my questions and lack of knowledge. I also found many useful tutorials on the website. Happy with the purchase of my first Juki and glad this is the place I got it from. I’ll be back for more! Good Customer service goes a long way!</Text>

<Text>We were looking for a sewing machine for my daughters bday. We actually tried to order one from back east as that’s all I could find. The place was dragging their feet on charging me. I called back two days in a row and still nothing. I just wanted the receipt to put in a bday card. After 3 days with no charge I canceled and found this place. Joseph was really nice and knowledgeable. Spent some time on the phone with me explaining options and why. I ended up buying the machine from them over the phone. I knew we wouldn’t have it in time but he knew I just wanted the receipt. He went above and beyond and sent us these photos. My daughter noticed the card with her name on it! It went so much further than just a receipt and some internet pics. A1 customer service! Would highly recommend< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Andrea Aguilar</user_name><Time>1518829603272</Time><rate>5< /rate><text>Talk about OG customer service!  I came in to have an old sewing machine serviced and it cost me $63.  Joseph, the mechanic, called me up and asked me what I wanted to sew with, essentially setting it up so it could sew denim.  He was honest, saying it would work and it might be a bit much for the machine to handle but to take it easy while sewing such material, as it required more torque and a slower rate to sew denim.  I was promptly  called up a few days latter to pickup the machine. I picked it up, took it home and didn't bother to ask how to thread the bobbin or the needle, thinking I could figure it out.  Steven, his Joseph's brother was there and was very kind when I picked it up.  However, what floored me was when I came back several days latter with my sewing machine.  It was Monday or Tuesday, Joseph and the other employees were swamped with phone calls and customers.  He asked me what I needed and I told him I didn't know how to thread the bobbin.  "Bring it in and take it back here," he said.  Ten or 15 minutes later he happily sat down with me and showed me how to thread the bobbin by explaining how to set the tension on the thread and screw.  Without flinching or a sign of frustration his explanation was great and the best you could ask for as a newbie to sewing machines.  Thanks Joseph and ABC Sewing!  Stay cool and local!.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

He quickly located some Juki parts that I needed and got them ordered. Then he went on a hunt for some hard to find needles for an old Adler, and hunt he did and was able to locate again what I needed. I am very pleased. Steve's follow ups were thorough and fast. His website and ordering system are state of the art too. If ever I am in need of sewing supplies I know who to call. Thank you for your superior service!<//text>< pics>

We came for lunch over the weekend and the place had a few people but was not crowded. The buffet was open and we opted for that. The flavors were good and the food was fresh. They charged around 45$ for a family of 4 (2 kids, 2 adults).< /review>

Very nice Indian place. I would say it is a historic place were top people visited.  I came walking from Stanford university and luckily explored this. Highly recommended Punjabi taste.< /Review>

I come here for the buffet on Saturday a lot. It's always so delicious and the staff are so friendly. I highly recommend this place for great Indian food, and if you're vegetarian/vegan, they have fantastic options, too!<//Review>

Taste of the food is really good. Will get more quantity as well. In order to get faster orders better place the order and go for pickup instead of directly place e order in the restaurant.</text>

Lunch buffet is good with authentic Indian curries. In case of dinner (which isn't buffet), there is a lot of waiting time involved. Nevertheless, the veg-biryani that I tried here is really good. Good place for vegetarians. :)<//text>

<review>We had the lunch buffet on Saturday.

Some of the dishes were very good - the black daal, saag, kadi. Some others were too full of oil and very salty. Also, the samosa was really bad.

However, for the price one is paying ($11) for the buffet, I think it's a good deal overall.</review>< Pics>

Just got a thali take away from this place. Amazing. I went in almost at closing time around 10pm. They still offered me a take away meal from the menu $15. Lot of items with nice packing, fresh and amazing taste. 3 types of curries( aloo palak, mutter panner, dal) 2 naans, rice, fresh salad, papad, raita, jamoon, tamarind chutney and one another green chutney. Can't ask for more.</text>

There is a lady who works here she is rude. 0 customer service that is why whenever I pass by there is hardly any customer sitting inside. Very bad.< /Text>

Grabbed to 2 for $3 breakfast sandwiches with sausage, egg and cheese and 1 with the New Chicken patty. I don't know how much care they took into putting the food together but it was sloppy and didn't taste as fresh as we usually get these. The buns were all soggy and smushed and just the entire order didn't taste good. The other locations in Bakersfield area their food is good. Here in Lamont the food is good when they feel like it. Disappointed.</Text>

Good Jack in the Box location! Gotta hand it to their team for always being on top of online orders. They've also accommodated my order for a meatless breakfast sandwich and made sure I was charged less for having less ingredients. The service is great and speedy 😊.</Review>

< review>
A convenient place to get something  to drink and a quick bite to eat, and visit the restroom if need be. Has never been crowded when we've visited.  We have found Jack in the Box restaurants to be consistently clean with tasty food and drinks.  Speed of service can vary a lot.</review>

Honestly all I enjoy at "Jack In The Box" are breakfast meals; tacos, salads, seasoned fries, shakes & deserts. Well, I guess I do indulge "Jack in the Box" more than I allow to be known. So, as far as the Jack meals I do eat, with consideration of fast-food, yeah I give Jack in the Box my respects!< /Text>< pics>

10-21-2017 1:40am. Although i love jack in the box and will still be a customer in the future, I had purchased a lot of food in the jack in the box on weedpatch highway and after eating my meal i felt very very sick. I threw up about 14 times, i feel super weak, and i cant eat any food because idk why my body doesnt want it, i went to the doctor to ask questions and they said that the worker for gravyard probably did not wash his hands and my doctor told me i need to be tested for hepatitis A.</Text>
