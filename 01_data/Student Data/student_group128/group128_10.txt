There isn't a better Party On Rentals company for the South Bay area than Tlapazola Party Rentals. They are quick, efficient, and friendly. Making my order was a breeze, Aleyda made it so easy. The set up crew were on time and thorough. It made our party a huge success! NOTE: Be sure to tip the guys that do the set up! they go above and beyond it making sure your set up is done quickly and efficiently!</Review>

Got a small Spiderman bouncy house and my kid loved it! Super easy to book! There were a lot of options, fairly cheap, and it was delivered on time! I also love that I didn't have to do any labor myself, as it was delivered, set up, and removed by their team.<//Review>

I hosted a BBQ for my company and we used PartyOn! Rentals for tables, chairs, tents, a boucny house and a snow cone machine. I am SO glad I went with this company. Their prices are very reasonable, they came on time and set everything up for us, and they were right on time for breakdown. We had a wonderful BBQ and I was so thanksful for all of the rentals we had. I will definitely use them again!</review>

Fantastic experience with this company!! Boy was that easy. And inexpensive. They came on time, blew up the bouncy house, secured it, and came back after the party was over, took it down and left. It cost—wait for it—$99 out the door. For an entire day of a bouncy house which was a hit at our 5 yr old’s birthday. I will gladly rent from them every single time.

Oh and I should mention, given the size constraints and slight incline at one of the locations we were considering for the bouncy house, they promptly assisted me, had me email a few pics, and changed the bouncy house conveniently to one that would fit in my backyard THE DAY BEFORE the party. With less than 24 hrs notice. Just great customer service. 👍🏼< /Review>

Came right when they were supposed to and picked up right on time. Fast set up and tear down, very nice and bounce house was clean and perfect. Thank you guys so much for the great customer service as well. I had to change the delivery time a couple of days before and it was no problem. Easy, reliable and will use again. Thank you for the great service.<//Review>

However I didn't like that I couldn't confirm before the week of my sons party, I thought if the bouncer I ordered wasn't going to be available it wouldn't give me much time to try to book from another rental company since my son wanted a car theme birthday if I could only confirm the week of his birthday but everything worked out great. The bouncer I ordered was available and delivered on time and picked up on time. Thank you Party On for making my sons birthday special.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

It was my son's 5th Birthday Celebration this past weekend. I was a lot nervous about putting the whole thing together as it was going to be the very 1st big celebration I was hosting since my husband / my son's dad passed away 2 years ago, to the exact day today. I wanted to celebrate our son / his only son BIG for this birthday. He deserved it / we deserved it. It's been quite difficult moving on since losing his father. But, once the invitations went out I knew there was no way of turning back. So, because I went with a "Splash-Bash" theme, I booked the Lil' Wave Splash Water Slide & other items from Party On.  It was all worth it, just to see smiles on all the kids / guests' faces when they seen it & played made me glad I chose to do this. I chose to rent the items overnight and I was so glad I did. I felt like a kid again when I decided to try out the water slide myself the day after before they came to pick it up. And, I absolutely, loved it - I needed that! Party On exceeded my expectations, they made this celebration easier to get through and just have a great time. I'm so pleased with their pricing, booking / phone service, on-time delivery, products, their drop-off & pick-up personnel, all the way through to pick-up.  I would definitely, definitely recommend Party On to anyone who's in need of a rental recommendation. I would definitely continue to call them for all my party/celebration rental needs. Thank you, thank you, for your awesome service!<//review>

Easy to order and schedule online.  They always call prior to the event to confirm.  They deliver on time and always have correct order.  Very professional.  I've used them for birthday parties for the past 5 years.<//review>

I was able to reserve the jumper 2 days before the party and it was delivered in great time before the party.  The combo jumper was in great condition ( I think it was brand new 😀). The drop off and pick up persons were pleasant and easy to deal with.  I would definitely order from here again.<//text>

<Text>This is the first time I have used "Party On" and it will definitely not be my last. They were very professional, friendly and prompt with delivery & pick-up. The price I was given was extremely fair & quite reasonable compared to many other companies. I have no hesitation in recommending  them for anyone needing party rentals.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Very bad experience with this company's delivery man on Saturday 5/14. 1st he was late and didn't have the courtesy to call. I had to call him 3 different times. Finally arrived and then we he picked up the jumper he was very rude and had an attitude. My nephew forgot his sweater in the jumper and he didn't let him go back in to retrieve it. I called the office on Monday to complain and the lady that took my call advised she would call me back on Monday with an update and today is Tuesday and I haven't heard from her or the company. Will never rent from them again. Very poor customer service. Not worth having to deal with a company with such bad service. Don't waste your money and time with them. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!!! Gave them a 1 star because I had to otherwise it wouldn't let me write my review but they are for sure a ZERO Star company.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Do not use this place. The staff is so rude to customers!  I asked to pay double for them to serve 10 miles outside of their service area and the lady had a nasty attitude and talked to me like I was inconveniencing her by asking. I think everyone so take the advice she gave me and go to someone else.

I plan to tell my friends and family, who all live in their service region to never book them for their events or PTA/school functions.</Text>< Date>

recently had a party over the weekend for my daughters 6th and 4th birthday, and I was very impressed with this company, their staff and their jumper.

The party started off rocky because I did not order a generator to accompany the jumper because I was told that I can use the electricity at the church that is attached to the park. When the jumper arrived to that park, I was informed the electricity at the church was not working. The delivery man immediately got on the phone to see how he can help me set up this jumper before the party started. They agreed to set up the jumper and then send another driver with a generator so that I can blow up the jumper. After the first driver left, I was told that, in fact the electricity doers work, and I plugged in the jumper myself and it worked perfectly. I called the company again, and cancelled the generator.

Through all of that stress and confusion (and me being 8 months pregnant), this company never got irritated or was rude to me. They were so understanding and helpful and did everything they could to try to get my jumper, and my party, up and running.

I was very impressed with all of the staff and with their jumper. It looked amazing and kept the kids happy for hours.

Last year, I ordered a jumper for a park party and they delivered it late, picked it up late, and the thing kept falling over with the kids in it. Not to mention, they charged me double what Party On rentals charged me.

Party On Rentals has the best staff and the best prices around and I will definitely be calling them again for all my future parties.<//text>

Awesome service, friendly, timely arrival and setup was insrant also pickup without hassle. The jumper was clean and had no problems with it despite the wind which was abit stronger than normal.  It was a huge hit with the kids. The adults were able to enjoy themselves while the kids were having a blast. Will most certainly rent from you again.</Review>

PartyOn! makes it easy to browse & order their services, so that's a big plus.  Set-up & takedown are fast.  We had one issue where the rep discovered a problem with the jumper after it was set-up.  He was extremely apologetic, and they had to take it down & send for a replacement.  Fortunately the replacement was the exact same model as I ordered, and they had it set-up before any guests arrived.< /review>

My son loved his Spider-man jumper with slide combo for his 4th b'day party. It was huge, looked brand new and super clean. It accommodated all my party guests from ages 3 to 50 and all in between. I will definitely be using PartyOn Rentals again and refer them to all my family and friends😆<//Review>

We had a party for my niece Stephanie's and Carlos daughter Ava Pena in Rancho Cucamonga in April 2017, Delilah was the one who assisted me.  She is great ! she always takes care of our order's, the rest of the office ladies are great too.  The driver's did an awesome job !!  they delivered on time, very kind.   We ordered a jumper, a popcorn machine, and we also ordered chairs.  Dalilah thank you again for your courteous and professional help ! Party on Rentals is lucky to have you there.   I will always recommend Party on Rentals.</Review>

Good chairs/tables/pop-ups. Arrived almost on-time. Pick-up was a little late. Thought it would be one delivery guy instead there were 3 who set up pop-ups & tables. All in all it was a good experience. We'll call you again next year.< /text>

<Text>I've rented jumpers from Party on for 8 years. They always deliver on time. Not to mention the kids have a blast especially with the obstacle course.<//Text></record></dataset><record>
< text>
I had order a Disney Planes Jumper for my sons birthday. Made it very Clear it was a Disney Planes jumper, the day of the party they showed up with a regular "plain" jumper. I asked them to please bring me what i paid for they refuse. They told me if they were taking the jumper back they were taking everything else i rented. Very very rude. never again renting from this company<//text>

The jumper was clean, set up on time, and picked up on time. The employees that delivered the jumper were very professional and kind. The only thing I can point out is that your prices are higher than your competition<//review>

Awesome service and great prices.  Tried to get some tires at another local shop and I felt like they did not want my business.  Can't go wrong with 530 Tire Pros<//Text>

<Review>This is the first time I have felt strong enough about a business to write a review. I cannot begin to express my thanks to Chris and his crew. They are a throw back to old school business values, HONEST AND INTEGRITY.  They have helped me out so much, have gone above and beyond to do so. You do not find this in auto shops anymore, especially if you are a woman. Their work is impeccable and they go out of their way to work around your schedule. I am recommending them to everyone I know. You will not be disappointed. I will never let anyone work on my car other than them. BEST SHOP IN SHASTA COUNTY.< /Review><resp>{'time': 1471483799324, 'text': 'Deborah strait,  We appreciate the kind words and are very glad to have you as a customer.

This is my 3rd time returning back to them. They treat me fairly and don't try to force a bunch of unnecessary stuff on you. They are honest and fair and will tell you when you need things and when things can wait.<//review>

Tony is friendly and professional in his manner. He kept me informed on the progress of my vehicle and as soon as it was finished, called to let me know it was finished. I would recommend him for all your vehicle needs.This review is for the new shop Anderson Tire Pros and Automotive (formerly 530 Tire)<//review>

Stellar customer service from the whole team!

I was able to drop my car off and go have lunch at Red Robin. They texted me to let me know my car was done before I finished lunch.

The new shop offers oil changes with a full service shop including tires/mounting and balancing with 4 wheel alignment available.

Awesome service

A big thank you to Chris, Laurie & their whole team.

I really appreciate your service!< /text>

Just had my oil changed and tires rotated in less than 20 minutes. Chris and Laurie the local owners took care of my vehicle in a timely manner. They also pointed out a few other issues without being pushy. I am bringing my car here next week's to get those other issues serviced. I would recommend Chris and Laurie they are fair and put service before sales. Will definitely be going back.< /Text>

My wife and I had a set of four tires installed on our Durango by 530 Tire Pros and couldn't be happier with everything.  I was looking for a specific tire which they were able to order and receive in just two days' time!  We needed them at the last minute due to rain and snow storms that we drove through on our vacation.  The service was top notch and the owners are great to work with.  This is a great example of a local family owned business that can truly deliver.< /text>

I recommend there them.  I had a tire go flat, a new tire, and it was something that broke, the something in the tire that let's you know when your tire is flat.  It was diagnosed right away and fixed quickly.

Tony Head at 530 Tire Pros in Anderson was knowledgeable and helpful. He was extremely thoughtful and went above and beyond what was needed. There was one small hiccup with getting the tires to the shop in Anderson but Tony fixed the problem the same day and got me in quickly.

His team works efficiently to get everybody in and out as fast as possible. From the time I got the phone call my tires were in, and the time I left the shop with the tires installed, was one hour. Very fast service without sacrificing quality.

I will be returning to 530 Tire Pros in Anderson for my tire rotations and next set of tires. Thanks Tony!<//text>

I've used 530 Tire Pros since Laurie and Chris opened their Anderson location. My most recent repair I had done at their Redding shop. I don't know of any other shop that would go above and beyond the way that Laurie did to make sure I had my truck back to me in a timely manner, and at a price I was comfortable with.</review>

In order to warranty tires we have to show the manufacture where we purchased the tires and when etc.\nMany times we warranty tires out of our pocket to take care of our customers.

I've left a 5 star review in the past when 530 was located in Anderson, however my experience at the new location wasn't up to par. I ordered tires (via TireBuyer online) for a friend that ended up balding way too quickly and when she brought it to my attention I let her know that 530 should be able to help in regards to checking the warranty and getting replacement tires. She wasn't informed any information pertaining to the issue and was simply told she'd have to pay out of pocket for 2 brand new tires. TireBuyer does in fact honor all warranties, so I'm not sure why this wasn't brought up. After speaking with a TireBuyer representative we now have the information we need to move forward in the future. The fact that none of this was explained though at 530 is disheartening and it felt like they were just trying to make a buck which isn't the vibe I am used to from this team. Hoping this gets addressed for future clientele.

(Updating to respond to owner.)

There must be some miscommunication happening between you as an installer and businesses providing the products (in this case tires) because according to the representative I spoke to there should have been options presented. (I.e. Referring the customer to get in touch with TireBuyer if that's all you could do.) That wasn't even suggested. You mentioned that in order to warranty tires you need to show the manufacturer where and when they were purchased – that is information I believe you have on file. Although, I do understand what you're trying to explain. The rating isn't for not honoring warranties, but for not expressing alternative options as TireBuyer suggested there should have been.</Review>

Chris the owner is worth talking to before taking it to the reviews. I had no idea he was available and acted out of haste. "Helpful in spending my money. Where can I get a fair oil change in Redding that will support my older car?
I feel punished for taking care of my stuff!" Original post.
Upon posting this horrible review done in emotional turmoil, the owner Chris got back to me promptly. He is a very nice person and I will take my car back to him. I just want a shop I can trust and communicate with.
Chris seems like a nice guy who cares about customer service and I will give this shop another try.  Thanks Chris, and I'm sorry, it's been a very trying time here in Redding..</review>

No one told me in order for the warranty not to voided I had to rotate them every 5 thousand miles. Apparently it's somewhere in the depths of my paperwork. I rotated them 2 times in 28 thousand miles on them. They are so bald the shop guy told me it was dangerous to drive on them! Even without rotation ever 5 thousand they didnt even last half of their 75 thousand warranty life. They wanted me to pay money upfront for 2 new tires so they can send my old ones in and POSSIBLY get a rebate for them. I told them I don't feel comfortable with that brand of tire at all. They won't let me get any other brand of tire with a pro rate only thr same kind!!! You think since they DIDN'T EVEN LAST HALF THEIR EXTRA COST WARRANTY LIFE they'd show a little more concern. NOPE!!! Don't buy Hercules tires folks! I don't want this to happen to anyone else! It is a real downer since ive been with them for years. Off I go to America's Tires then 😑<//Review>< Pictures>

They have great prices on their tire. They even do a safety  expection on your car or truck to make sure you are safe on the road. If you want good tire's this is the place to get tire's a lil pricey but worth it.</review>

Love how open and clean it is! They have coloring pages behind the counter but you just need to ask for them and my daughter loved spending time there. They have so many programs available for everyone! Went around noon and the place was not crowded at all. Just a few people in there. Staff is super friendly and very helpful😃<//Review>

< review>
I have been a Palmdale resident since 1985. I used to take my daughter here all the time. We both loved this Branch and lived fairly close. I was out of state for 7 years and when I came back to Palmdale in 2012, my first trip to the Library since my return was not enjoyable. I understand the lack of city funding but this is really sad. There are homeless and street people who are only flopping in there to get out of the weather. Or to sit. I stopped going after my fifth experience of having to sit next to an unwashed person who stank so bad I had to leave. I don't feel safe in there.The mothers don't control their kids. The computers break down. The womans' restroom is horrible.The Library should be a sweet escape to peaceful quiet space to enrich our minds. Please save the Palmdale Public Library!</review>

< review>
I'm 25 years old. I've lived in 4 different counties. Never have I ever been told you have to be older than 18yrs old to get a library card. Not everyone has access to internet. My little sister needs to go to library for school work. My mom works double shifts, including weekends. I'm not my little sisters legal guardian so I can't get a library card for her. Erin explained all this to me on the pohne. She was very polite which is why I gave 2 stars. But this is a ridiculous policy for a public library.<//review>

Thanks for being there, and tell the librarians they are nice, but they sure don't apply even "shushing" among the different varieties of kids. It was a four-star review, but discriminatory librarians are not fun.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I love this library.
The people who work there are super nice and encouraging. And there are so many good books to choose from! I'm always very excited whenever I go to Palmdale City Library.</review>

I liked the accessibility and convenience of the number of work stations available.
Often same work station assigned to 2 people at same time.
Areas not clearly designated on most stations
Woman who works in book return area gave me change and I believe it is was the only woman that was helpful and friendly that I talked to.
If she hadn't been there I would.have walked out in frustration.
Other girl at info desk was basically useless
Hopefully tomorrow will b a better experience than the last.<//Review>

Not the best library in town, but does offer every amenity as any other library to complete whatever library task that you may have. Go get your library card and read some books.< /text>

<Text>New management has definitely stepped in and done some cleanup. However, not the best place for academic study. Loud. Kids section echoes through the whole library. Thin walls allow all traffic sounds to bleed through. Computer lab & tables are more a point of 'cafe discussion' than for research & reading. No one walks around assisting gabby talkers to keep the noise down. A lot of meetings also seem to take place here in the open with various organizations spanning math & grammar tutors to job placement advisors. Nice place, but if you choose to hang around, bring your coffee & donuts, or your earplugs depending on your interests..</Text>< UserId.>

This is my favorite Catholic book store! They have an unbelievable collection and the staff is amazing. My favorite items are the encased Rosary collections. I have two in particular that are just breathtaking. If you're a proud Catholic or someone that needs faith desperately in your life like so many of us do right now, please check it out. I feel great as soon as I step foot in the door. I highly recommend this wonderful store.< /text>

Great small business. The owner and her employees know there stuff. If you need a patron saint for something, they can tell you who it is and if they carry the medal. I went in to find books for my kids with their patron saints inside of them, they helped me find exactly what I wanted. I buy all my rosaries and medals here too. Great store. ❤<//text>

Went there with family prior to visiting a hospitalized member of the family due to a stroke. After browsing and talking with the owner, she informed us that the prior owner had a stroke with the same severity as our family member and the prior owner fully recovered so she was very reassuring to us about our family member making a full recovery. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS.<//review>

My most FAVORITE Catholic store and even though I have moved out of state, I will still shop there when I visit!!!  I never left without buying many wonderful items.  Family owned and operated... everyone is kind, knowledgeable and eager to assist.  Beautiful selection of holy statues!  I HIGHLY recommend this store.</text>

Great owners, a sweet married couple. Offered free Blessed Exorcism salt and Holy water. It is a little pricey with some items, but many places these days need to be to make it in the OC. Nice selection of prayers, books, and rosaries. I will go back! :)< /review>

This store has a variety of items that were perfect for a First Communion. I bought a rosary about a year and a half ago and it's still like new. The service was very helpful and considerate. The store is an adorable little place with everything you could want and what they don't have on hand they'll order for you.

Over all it was a wonderful experience.</Review>

Dr. Gregory is amazing! Her bedside manner is unbeatable- she is friendly, warm, and always willing to answer questions even if it causes the appointment to run over. She is very quick with procedures which I appreciate. Highly recommend this office.</Review>

Mary L. Tindle was delightful: kind, bright and informative. She offered an excellent game plan to deal with my issues. Also the physical exam was swift and highly competent. I’ve got a new Gyno I have confidence in.< /text>

Dr. Tindle was so great! She was so personable and made me feel comfortable right off the bat. Loved that she took the time to really get to know me and understood and listened to any of my questions and concerns I had. Will definitely be back and happy that I have found a great doctor. Thank you Dr. Tindle!</Text>

I saw Dr. Mary Tindle for issues with my irregular cycle and she was amazing! I have a nexplanon that is about to expire so she discussed the procedure process in changing it. She was very friendly, listened to my concerns, and answered my questions helpfully. She also gave me education on alternative birth control methods that could be more beneficial to me. I read a lot of reviews that reflected a negative aspect to this practice however I had nothing but a positive experience. My visit was less than a hour as a new patient. The front desk explained costs/coverage clearly and Dr. Tindle provided follow up information in a timely manner via the patient portal.

Definitely would recommend! Only thing I would say is that you should take an uber because there is no street parking. (Parking lots available but rates are ridiculous)</Text>

I've been seeing Mary Tindle (PA) in this practice for a few years now - she's amazing! Always so patient and thorough, really listens to your concerns and helps you understand what may be going on and is very dedicated to helping you find solutions to remedy them.<//Text>

<Text>This was my first visit at San Francisco Gynecology, INC and let me tell you all of the five star reviews are dead-on. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Mary Tindle was incredible! I felt listened to and they're so easy to reachout to after your visit as well. Best doctor visit I've had.< /Text>< user>

Very little wait time.  Excellent medical care in tough times.  Mary Tindle, N.P.  went through my medicines and covered all aspects of my health without cutting corners.  She also made appropriate referrals.</Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Sometimes this practice drops the ball in a way that is frustrating — but this time it was too much. Last month I was worried about having an ectopic pregnancy (because I had one a few months ago), and messaged Mary for a lab test to check if I was pregnant, so I could know to come in for an ultrasound to check for an ectopic. She said she sent it in but when I got to Lab Corp there was no record of it. Ok... understandable, sometimes people make mistakes.

When I messaged her about it to get a physical copy of the order I could take myself, she told me to look for the lab in the Portal. For the life of me, neither me nor my husband could follow her instructions or figure out where the lab was in the portal. I followed up multiple times asking for an emailed copy, and nobody ever responded. HUH???!

I’m justifiably and not irrationally concerned about a potentially life threatening issue and the office doesn’t care about helping me get ahead of it?? They just... ghosted me about something really important? They really left me in the cold in a dangerous and anxiety heavy place. I ended up calling my old ObGyn in another city who promptly got my lab to the right place.

Won’t be coming here anymore.</Text><userid>116117399538166762959<//userid><date>1608313094019< /date>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Terrible reception!  I got there and they said my insurance was not active, although I showed them that it was, I asked if they could call my insurance and she said “We have our system and we spend a lot of money on it so we don't waste time calling  insurance, I have other duties to perform ”.

Note: I called them to make this appointment and they redirected me to the site, I did everything there until I put my insurance information and received many calls and emails confirming that I was all ready to go to the consultation.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The office was clean, cozy and comfortable. The front desk receptionist was very friendly and knowledgable, as was my medical assistant and NP. The appointment was quick, to the point and everyone made me feel very comfortable for it being my first time here. I would highly recommend this office. Also, the ease of the patient portal is wonderful! Everything was so streamlined and easy.</review>

She was also super knowledgeable on different prescription types and was able to find something that worked for me, which was awesome! Thank you :)< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< resp>

<Text>Dr Gregory (and Mary, her PA) are two of the best doctors I have had. From normal checkups, advice about healthcare options, and even an emergency hospital visit at 1am, they consistently provide incredible care to their patients. They are non-judgmental and treat each patient with kindness. I cannot recommend them enough!< /Text>< user>

Fantastic experience. Mary Tindle is one of the loveliest medical professionals I've ever met and has an incredible, caring and warm bedside manner. From the front desk to the intake nurse to the exam itself, it was one of the best doctor office experiences I've had.</Review>

What's not to love about that Dr's office?! Everyone is so helpful and kind, a definite must at an OB office.
I've been seeing Dr Gregory for a while but lately another Dr has been stepping in, she is wonderful.
The comfort of speaking openly and making sure such intimate places are being cared for is a so rare, this place is like home and I recommend everyone and all!!< /review>

The doctors at SF gynecology are nice, however their billing department is incompetent. I got an IUD in 2017 and continued to receive bills until 2019 and I wouldn’t be surprised if they keep coming. In addition to being billed for longer than the length of my IUD they sent bills to my parents house where I haven’t lived in 10 years. I never put their address on any documents I filled out and yet somehow they still were sent there. The last bills I received weren’t ever billed to the correct insurance. I have no idea how they billed the wrong insurance when I supplied them with all the correct information. When I called and tried to ask for help the receptionist was no help and told me I’d have to call the billing department. Well I wouldn’t have to call the billing department if they had given them the correct information initially. I will never go to their office again. Their billing department is incompetent and now I’ve spent over $800 for my IUD because their incapable of billing correctly.</Text>

I've been going to Dr. Gregory's office for 9.5 years and will continue for as long as I live and work in SF. The office is very clean and the staff is very friendly. Making an appointment is easy and quick. Not much wait time at appointments which is important. Mary Tindle the NP is also wonderful! Highly recommend this office.< /Review>

This review is specifically for Jules. This could have easily been a 2 star-rating due to to scheduling snafu but Jules went above and beyond her normal scope of her job responsibilities and helped me sort out the scheduling mistakes, in addition to accommodating to be seen as soon as possible.

<Review>Don't look anywhere else, this is the perfect gyno office you could hope for! I've seen Dr. Gregory and also her PA Mary Tindle. They both put me at ease, were extremely professional and friendly, did not rush me at all, took the time to let me ask all my questions, and made me feel like they really cared about my health. Call them now!</Review>< Rate>

<Text>PA Mary Tindle was super energetic and friendly, we had some really great conversation all throughout the entire exam! Love using the patient portal as well to see all my lab results AND reads. The portal also provides a direct messaging system so that you can stay in touch with your provider directly (no more going through the front desk/concierge folks)!<//Text>< pics>

Finally found a good gyno in SF. Mary is wonderful. She has the perfect energy for something that *might* otherwise cause someone a lot of anxiety. She’s kind, funny and explains things so well!</review>

<Text>I called several times to her office to make an appointment but no one answered so I left voice messages for a couple of times. After about one week since I hadn't received any call from them, I called again. Somebody finally answered my call after 5 attempts. She was rude and she was not willing to answer my questions and for the whole time she was referring me to their website. I explained to her that the website does not allow me to make an appointment with Dr. Gregory.
Unfortunately, Dr. Gregory was not available for two months. It is so disappointing . If she is very busy with her current patients why she still accept new patients? I met her once and she was very good but making another appointment with her is totally impossible.
The only other option I had was to make an appointment with another person who works in that office but she is not a doctor.
All in all, I don't recommend Dr. Gregory to any new patients.<//Text>< pics>

Right before I moved to USA I was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst so I was scared about the idea of needing surgery while being abroad.
I didn’t know anybody in the city and I did my best searching for the right Gynrcologist and I’m so lucky of finding Dr Gregory. She helped me with the cyst which it disappeared by itself and then with other things and in general she always gave me the best advices when I needed it during my visit or by email. Always kind and priffesional. She was the doctor who really followed my health through out my 7 years in SF.
Now I’m back to my country and a happy mom and I would have loved to have have Dr Gregory here.
I definitely hardly recommend her.< /review>

<Text>I haven't met Dr. Gregory yet, as I saw the Physician's Assistant, Mary Tindle for my first appointment here, a routine PAP appointment. I'm the kind of patient who likes to ask a lot of questions. Mary was very personable; she listened intently, gave insightful responses, and never made me feel rushed.

The office's online patient portal makes scheduling appointments, taking care of forms in advance of an appointment, viewing prescriptions and test results, and emailing the doctor really easy. For any future gynecological needs, I'll be back, and I highly recommend Mary Tindle and this office.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

< review>
I went to Dr Gregory with uncontrollable, extreme abdominal pain that had been going on for several months. Her advice? "Try to relax and email me in a few months." I can't fathom how she gets away with this. Thankfully I kept seeking out specialists. A fibroid specialist from UCSF referred me to an endometriosis and pelvic pain specialist at UCSF (which should have been an obvious place for Dr. Gregory to deduct since I had an extensive endometriosis surgery in 2008). It took two visits but this woman (Dr. Lester) wouldn't give up on me. She located the source of the pain, a nerve that she injected with lidocaine to numb it. I am now pain free after almost a year. She also referred me to a chronic pain specialist at UCSF in case we had more work to do. Ladies: GO TO UCSF! These people know what they are doing! Dr. Gregory can GO TO HELL.< /review>

<Review>I've been seeing Dr. Gregory since I moved to SF six years ago.  I like her very much.  She listens, has good clinical skills, and getting in and out of her office is easy.  There's easy parking just around the corner.

Glad I found her.  What we all need.  A good GYN, and a better hairstylist!!< /Review><username>Jennifer Slepin</username><user_id>103499023169206946411< /user_id><resp>None</resp>< rate>

< Review>
The front office staff is very rude. Over the 3-4 phone calls I have had with them while being a patient they were not helpful and had the most unpleasant short tone.
Example: I was told on my first appointment (annual) by my Dr. that if  I had something minor, like a UTI, I would be able to call in and have the medication sent over to my pharmacy. I called in and now they are trying to force me into an appointment to come in because the Dr hadn't seen me before for this illness. If I asked if I could speak to my Dr, the woman on the phone said no, even if I booked an appointment but was unable to physically come in she would still not let me consult my Dr. She kept pushing me towards a "web portal" which who knows if the Dr actually responds or if it is just her staff.
Very unprofessional and I would highly suggest going to a different obgyn.</Review>

After seeing Dr Gregory for several years, an unfortunate incident occurred which is why I am writing this review. As a practitioner, Dr Gregory was always amazing to me. Her staff however, is quite another story. I received a voice mail while I was out of town on business stating that I had missed my appointment and would be charged a $50 fee. I emailed the practice stating that I had not received a reminder for the appointment and while I was sorry to waste her time, I didn't think it was right to charge me for an appointment I didn't know about. They ignored my first email so I wrote a second. They responded saying they would not charge me the fee... great right? problem solved? NOPE...they then kicked me out of the practice with a terse letter that I received today.
Just thought everyone should know... don't ever miss an appointment or you will be charged, and if you dispute it, you will be kicked out of the practice!!! Cannot believe that people actually run businesses this way.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I rarely write reviews, but this office is so HORRIBLE, I felt it was warranted to stop other patients from making the same mistake. The woman who works the front desk is honestly the rudest person I have ever met at any doctor/dentist I have visited in my life. She is snarky, short-tempered, and condescending to patients that are putting their trust in them. I dreaded having to call the office because she was so terrible. To make matters worse, they overcharged me by several hundreds of dollars, and when I asked for the refund, it took over 3 months to process because they apparently "don't handle any of the billing in the office."

Please do yourself a favor and AVOID this office. I really regret ever going there - it was a huge mistake.<//text>< pictures>

Love this banana republic because the clearance selection is good and the employees are super friendly.

If you buy a 3 pack of masks on the weekend they will embroider one of them or add a decorative patch to one for free (not 100% sure but I think you might be able to get them to embroider or patch a shirt in place of the mask)<//review>

One of the best Banana Republic stores in the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area. This one has great hours, more importantly they seem to always have a fantastic inventory, including items and clothes seemingly exclusive or at least not yet in stock at other stores.</Review>

<Text>Such a pity that they closed men's store. It was such a beautiful big give story store where one could find everything for a man. They did add men's department to the women's building, but it's not the same. All in all I like SF downtown Banana Republic , big selection of clothing, shoes, home goods, etc. Macy's is my favorite store, I hope they will never go out of business!<//Text>< Pictures>

Banana Republic has a flagship stores @the Grove.  Good news -- right now, they're running a 50 percent off pre holiday sale. Special pricing will continue through Monday, Dec 21.
BR clothing tends to have slightly higher price points.  So sale price make most items a bit more affordable.
The clothing, belts, suits and often shoes all
look to be well made.
Men's store takes up the entire 2nd floor.
Ground floor is devoted to women's clothing.  BR's outlook towards men's shirts, jacket, pullovers, trousers, t-shirts is best categorized as conservative w/a flair.
Sales help is well informed, seeks to please.  This location always has a post holiday sale; look for it early to mid January.< /text>

opening ceremony always has very friendly staff, humberto and carol really know what they are doing and that's why they're so successful. but the staff kinda keep a hawk eye on you to be sure there's no shoplifting.< /Review>

Usually never write reviews but unfortunately feel this is necessary. The service at this particular location is probably the worst service I’ve ever had in all my shopping experiences. I understand the holiday season can be stressful for retail, we’ve probably all been there at some point in our lives. But I was spoken to with such attitude from the moment I stepped up to the register to purchase over $900 worth of clothing that it totally turned me off from ever shopping at banana republic again. For certain reasons the items I purchased needed to be shipped to the location I would be receiving them, and I paid extra for expedited shiping because I needed them in a specific time frame. I received the order on time but 6 out of 9 items were missing from the order which I paid for. One item missing can happen, maybe two. But SIX items missing out of a 9 item order?! And the six items were physically in their hands in front of me at the store the day I purchased them. I watched them count them, I watched them swipe the card for them, I had specifically reserved them, and did not get them. When I went to go back and explain and figure out what happened, I was told that the receipt wasn’t enough proof that I didn’t get those items. Since when is a receipt not enough? And why would I want to go back into the store to deal with this? I tried to call the store prior to physically going there, and nobody picked up the phone each time I called. And when they did, I was put on hold for 15 mins and I just gave up at that point and went there myself. Absolutely most stressful experience just to order some nice professional clothing.<//review>

Thank you for accommodating us after hours in the heat of the summer. Your manager Thomas was so kind coming out and opening the gates, even offered to pick us up groceries or ice if we needed! Now that’s service! It looks like a great and clean park right next to the Dunes.< /text>

Our family have had the pleasure of a RV site in the new part of the park for the last 5 years.  The park offers full hook ups, bathrooms with showers and access to some of the best riding in the Imperial San Dunes.  The RV Park is always clean including the bathrooms and showers.  Each site has 30 and 50 amp service as well as a direct water hook up and connection for your black tank.  Each site also has a nice shade tree.  We often follow the shade during the day.  The park is a great place for families.  You'll often see kids riding around the park with their parents.  The park also includes a riding area just outside of the RV park but still within the RV park boundaries.  Access to the park are gated and monitored.  One of the best part of the park is Duner's Diner just a short distance away from the park.  Great meals if you don't want to cook!  During the off season, the gates are locked to limit access to non-guests but can be quickly unlocked with a quick call or text to Thomas the onsite manager.  We're very fortunate to have Thomas as the onsite manager.  He is always just a phone call or text  away if you need any help finding your site, backing in, setting up, providing recommendations for local RV repair services or parts, recommendations for riding areas, or offering recommendations for services or food in Yuma. He is the reason why  the RV park is always clean, safe and fun.  The park is a safe place to leave your RVs, Trailers and Toys.  Don't be surprised if Thomas stops by to ask if you need anything.  Flag him down if you have any questions or just to say hi, you'll often see him driving around the park on a maintenance run.</review>

Sandwiches are good, ratios of meat, cheese, etc are done well. Side pickle have a nice crunch. However when your pickle spear is broken you really should get both halves. Open for indoor dinning and the patio is nice, the option we chose. Nice drink options. Cookies look yummy but I have yet to try them, and of course they have the basic standard chip options as I don't recall any kettle chips.</Text>

He said it was the best sandwich he ever had. Since he has such a great pallet, I had to get one for myself and see what all the fuss was about. I got the garlic pesto chicken today and yeah, it was awesome. I'm not even a big fan of sourdough, but this bread is freaking delicious! Crusty yet tender, flavorful but not overly "sour". The house sauce, and the turkey with that pesto was just perfect. Every single bite I said mmmm. Pricey, yes, but so is Deli Delicious and this place blows them out of the water.  We'll definitely be back!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Thought we would try the place out for dinner, we ordered 2 clam chowder bread bowls, 2 bowls of clam chowder and a sandwich. We drive home sit down ready to eat and the bread bowls are empty, no clam chowder so please chexk your order before you leave. The customer service is terrible, first they ignore you until they feel like helping you then should you have a problem they treat you like you are looking for a hand out. I was charged for our meal and wasted my time driving back and forth to resolve this.<//review>< date>

I ordered a French dip. The sandwich was fantastic. Quality roast beef. The bread was hot and crunchy. The ajus was terrible. It was brown water. No flavor. How could you dip such a wonderful sandwich in warm water. My husband got the clam chowder bread bowl. It was fantastic!! It was pricey. We will return! Best bread ever!</review>

Even during the Covid 19 the staff wore their mask and so did the customers. Everything ran efficiently and smoothly. I have to commend the staff on doing an excellent job! The food was absolutely delicious and we didn't have to wait very long it's made fresh. We ordered the French dip with the salad and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich. The bread is so fantastic! We also bought an extra loaf of bread for $3.99  that you can pop into the oven. I highly recommend going to this little store just because the service was so good. Even the tea was tasty!</Review>

5 for food quality and taste, 2 stars for service
It took 25 minutes from the time I placed my order till the time I received my order. People that placed their order after me, received theirs. My order was messed up, things I asked to NOT PUT in my sandwiches WAS ADDED. I ordered this same sandwich a week earlier and the taste was much better. As long as it took to get me my food, it shouldn't have been wrong, there was not many other customers before or after me< /Text>

<Text>What happened? I go during the week and it's great, my wife and I went on Saturday and the ice tea was weak the music was loud and the bread was a little dry. Last of all they made my sandwich with meat I did not ask for. Plus the service was slow.< /Text>< Date>

Really appreciated customer friendly attitude of staff. Great salad with no scripting on ingredients.  Best quality lettuce, salad specific...not just typical shredded iceberg lettuce. Ill be back! Need to clean table after each use, though.</Text>

The sandwich was good, the soup was old and had been rewarmed several times
Service was also very slow it seemed they were filling drive through and phone orders before walk ins .< /review>

Went there yesterday for the first and last time.  Bread too chewy.  There are plenty of samdwich shops in this town, I would rather go to one that doesn't charge extra for pickles.<//Text>

Not as good as other locations usually are.
The bread was overcooked so it was too crusty and it changed the flavor. I was pretty disappointed because I drove from Stockton to Lodi specifically to go there since I'm used to the sandwiches being better. I'll probably stick with the Sacramento locations.</Review>

Expensive but sooo delicious 😋.  My husband who only tried my sandwich (he ordered from somewhere else) talked about it the next day... I think he wished it.< /text>

Very disappointed for my first time here.  The young lady that went to pick up the food was ignored for around 10 minutes waiting in the online order pick up line until another customer came in and went up the the cashier to pick up an order.  While my tomato soup was good the aus ju for the french dip was tasteless as if I was dipping my sandwhich in water.  The meat was under seasoned as well.  Also the combo said that it came with a drink and I did not get that either.  Not sure if I will be back to give it another try.</review>

Ron was very knowledgeable and helpful. I am just researching how to build my own drones and Ron offered me a lot of good advice. I will be back during the construction phase of my project.< /review>

<Review>this is an easy to find location with a decent-sized parking lot. The staff is pleasant and knowledgeable about their products as well as the local aerial hobby scene. they sell both kits and individual parts, but because they have so many different types of products they don't have a large selection of any one brand or product type. I was looking for a drone shop but they seem to focus more on the plane side. I will probably come back here to pick up some parts in the future.</Review><Rate>4<//Rate><Resp>None<//Resp><username>Brian Atkinson<//username>< time>

<text>Perry is an amazing man. I had not been into the store for about 2 years, he immediately began to talk to me as though I was in there yesterday. He asked me about my  bar b q'ing, my dogs and other topics. I was shocked.

They have a fantastic inventory and are extremely knowledgeable and go out of their way to give you instructions.

This is the best hobby shop in the bay area.< /text>< rating>

Only reason it got 1 was because of selection they have a vast selection. Now why would you have a "drone guy" that wont help anyone out a little redundant. I called tried to see how much they would charge me to swap a Flight Controller he goes on to explain how i should do it but the whole reason im calling "the drone guy" is so he can possibly do it for me. I just found that lazy why say you have a drone guy when he wont do nothing. I wpuld do it but no access to a Pc. I recommend this place if your looking for something from Horzon Hobby other than that theyre no help. I was even gonna buy the stuff there but the "drone guy" musy be too busy. Oh well.<//Text>

Really loving this place. It's now my go-to local hobby shop for RC aircraft (I fly planes and now a quadcopter). For several visits I only purchased small-ish items (spare parts, finally a TX), and they were always helpful and low-key.

Most recently I got a quad-copter there and had trouble getting it set-up with my TX. The staff (possibly the owner - he's always there) was super helpful. It turned out to be 100% my error, but he was gracious about it and showed me how to get everything set-up properly.<//Review>

The review is getting 1 star based on extremely poor customer service.  I visited Aeromicro about a week ago to purchase 50 bucks worth of add-on parts for a quad.  All parts worked out except a set of lock nuts that were off by 1 size.  I went back to the store thinking this should not be problem to exchange but I guess I was wrong.  The guy told me that he could not exchange it because I opened up the plastic bag that contained the lock nuts - for a moment I thought it was April fools day.  I guess they do not appreciate return business.  The sales guy was also a bit rude, not too helpful in any sense of the way.  I will rather order from China than go back to this store.</review>

When I need anything for my crash-proof Zagi HP flying wing, AeroMicro will have it for sure on the shelf.  The Zagi HP is mail order-only, but get only metal gear servos, Trainer Cable and TWO RADIOS, and every other plane here.

I pity the poor person who tries to learn to fly without a Trainer Cable and Second Radio.  Way cheaper trust me.  Fly Baylands Park in Sunnyvale for ultra-safe, wide-open space, with high incentive not to crash "Out there where Geese go, well you know..."  Hmmm, fly well !  :-)<//review>

If you have an appointment for a second dose at Kedren you should show up in the morning anyway. They are not prioritizing appointments. Everyone gets in the same line. Employees are doing their best to manage a chaotic crowd. Please do not be like all the poeple complaining everywhere around me all morning. How hard is it for grown adults to relax and patiently wait?< /Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They give you an hour for your appointment and the lines are huge, you have to ask why there is no one to guide you, there is no accessibility to use bathrooms, waiting time is more than 3 hours.
There is a row for the first vaccine and another for the second.

The aesthetics, vibe, and the eclectic selection of restaurants has it all in this place.

Wow this place is amazing 🤩 talk about having a food variety all in one place what a great idea, with indoor outdoor eating space!! A lot of different food options and desserts too! Nice and big spacious environment this is my first time here and I will definitely be back to try more food options, I mean why not! But on today’s visit i tired Belly Snout, I saw a picture of Guy Fieri 🤩 and I knew this was what I am choosing today!! I will have to review them on their own so check it out, won’t disappoint!!<//review>

It was very clean and organized. It would have been perfect if we could have eaten our food there. Overall highly recommended if you are interested in trying something new.</Review>

Love coming here! There's something for everyone and tbh it makes me nostalgic for NYC. Also, don't sleep on the gelato shakes from popbar or the shrimp fried rice (I can't remember which kiosk it was from). Good food all around.< /Text>

Haven City Market is a relatively new place which is really just a collection of great restaurants with expansive outdoor dining. None of the restaurants at Haven City are massive businesses so if you are looking for a places like that then Haven City Market isn’t the place to go. However, if you are looking for smaller businesses with great food then you’re in the right place. I’ve only eaten at a few places there but they were all amazing. I found the Cauldron to be a great place for ice cream. Overall, a really nice market witch even nicer food.< /review>

A great culinary hub in RanchoCucamonga. I enjoy the diverse food select and open area atmosphere. I highly recommend it for families, and even casual business meetups. Seems great for the casual date as well. Damn, I just realized I'm single.😑<//text>

<Review>It is a very nice place  especially when you want to get out and try something new! Last night my Husband and I were at the little Greek place ( Basha K.. nooot for sure on the name) and we saw a cheerful group of people all sitting and we couldn't figure out what they were doing until we walked up to them. THEY WERE DOING A GROUP PAINT!!! Not your average grub. Not your average experience! YUM!!!<//Review><rating>5</rating>< username>

This place is so cute. The back outdoor seating had such a nice ambiance. They had Brave projected on the screen for the families and plenty of spaced out seating.</Review>

<Text>It was a bit more busy than I am comfortable with, but I suppose that's very good for the restaurants, so that's not a complaint, just a comment. The ordering online isn't all that practical, as only a handful of the stores have it available, and at least one that's available doesn't work. But it is very fun to have so many choices all together, and there was nicely spaced outdoor seating.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Great Spot with great food. The atmosphere is fun for a date night or lunch with the family. I have recommended this place to several friends and family, my kids husband and I love it. It's nice to be able to decide what you want to eat even if everyone else doesn't want the same thing. I like that they offer Apple pay and Google pay which makes it convenient when you have teens who want something different than you want. We can all order our food at the same time a lot of the locations have QR codes so you don't have to wait in line, either way the way is not long. Great selection of food. Really cute patio set up with enough seating. If you check out their Facebook page you will find that certain days they have live music or comedy shows.< /Review>< pics>

Lots of food options! Why pick one when you can pick all?!

Only negative thing for me is that it's usually overcrowded. But that just shows how good this market is.<//text>

A lot of great choices to eat if you don't mind spending a little extra. This place does not cater to big families with a lot of mouths to feed. In my opinion they cater more to adults food-wise. It was very clean, and nice ambience. The outdoor sitting with a DJ was a nice touch. Small pets are allowed from what I seen. I will be returning to try something new at this location. It appeared to get more crowded after 6 p.m. and some places were sold out meat like the BBQ stand with the pulled pork. I was told they sell out by lunch time.< /Review>

Nice place to try different eats, outdoor patio, misters in summer heaters in winter. Native son bar has lots of craft beers on tap and good selection of custom cocktails. Weekend live music and weekday movies. Fun place to hang and chill.</Text>

I enjoyed the Brisket plate I got at Elmer and Jaspers. I wasn't a huge fan of the prices in Haven Market. This makes me less likely to frequent the area.</Review>

This place was so cute! We came here as a big group to celebrate a friend's birthday so it was perfect that there were a million and one options - Everyone could find something they liked!

I wanted to try something new so I went with Taiwanese cuisine. I tried the Dan Dan noodles, which has spicy pork and is served with a boiled egg. Though it wasn't actually spicy, it had a lot of flavor and was really good! I also decided to get myself and the birthday girl a drink from the bar. It was the Big Samurai, I believe. I just loved the adult style capri sun packaging haha and they were fairly strong too.

Our group also took advantage of a lot of the dessert options! We got two different kinds of churros and ice cream, crepes with banana strawberry and Nutella, and mini churros with a chocolate dipping sauce. Everything we had was great, the atmosphere was very nice for either groups or date night, and I definitely plan to come back to try all of the other yummy food options soon!<//review>

It's going shopping for a large variety of prepared food in one central location. The sitting arragement is great, large eating area. It works great for Social Distancing.</review>

With plenty of parking and easy to find made the visit pleasant.
The plaza has many different restaurants available with a variety of foods to choose from.
Italian food, Asian selections, American food fusions, to specialty hotdogs, fresh fruit juice, boba, and much more. Some photos not shown.

With lots to choose from we decided to go with "JoJo's Kitchen" Taiwanese eats.
We got an order of their Popcorn chicken, Dan Dan noodles, and Beef noodle soup photo not shown.
Everything was good and enjoyed our meal outside. Their service was Expedient and polite.
Then went to Acai Life superfoods and got a watermelon juice drink to go which was delicious and quite refreshing on a hot day. Service was excellent.
We'll have to come back one day to check out some other options in the market place.</Text>< Pics>

A lot of great choices to eat if you don't mind spending a little extra. This place does not cater to big families with a lot of mouths to feed. In my opinion they cater more to adults food-wise. It was very clean, and nice ambience. The outdoor sitting with a DJ was a nice touch. Small pets are allowed from what I seen. I will be returning to try something new at this location. It appeared to get more crowded after 6 p.m. and some places were sold out meat like the BBQ stand with the pulled pork. I was told they sell out by lunch time.< /Review>

Nice place to try different eats, outdoor patio, misters in summer heaters in winter. Native son bar has lots of craft beers on tap and good selection of custom cocktails. Weekend live music and weekday movies. Fun place to hang and chill.< /text>

The first time I discovered this place, I was thrifting at the Goodwill next door. I saw the outside so I decided to go in and check it out. The look and feel is very trendy and cute. Super IG worthy. I've only tried Firewings (which was fire), and another place I can't remember, but I plan to eventually try every place inside there.< /Text>

< Review>
We went here tonight for the Taste of Haven event - pay $30 and get 6 vouchers for sampler dishes at the restaurants of your choice. We enjoyed the experience, and it was a neat way to get introduced to the various restaurants and try different options. My favorite was the Baba K chicken shwarma, and my husband's favorite was the Jojo's braised pork belly rice.

However, the items should have mathematically been worth $5 each, but not all of them were. For example, the Vietnamese sandwich from Lantern was tiny, as was the Jojo's pork belly rice bowl. Although the event was a fun way to try the foods, we wondered after if it would have been cheaper to actually buy small dishes at each place, rather than the whole $30.

Also, we were there 5-6:30pm, and Elmer & Jasper's as well as Belly & Snout were sold out of their voucher products. :(</Review>

I've been coming to Haven City Market since it's opening weekend last year. They have a good variety of food vendors to choose from, mostly asian fusion from what I've experienced. It's basically an Inland Empire version of the Anaheim Packing District if you've ever been there before. Same concept of one big trendy place with a bunch of different vendors inside.

Haven City has a real nice outdoor seating area for you to dine out and enjoy the day/evening with some good food. I believe they also do offer movie nights and morning workout classes? Not sure if those are still being offered but I know in the past they have been. Usually during the evenings they have live entertainment in the outdoor area as well.

So far I've tried a few of the vendors: BurgerIM, Fire Wings, Pan Pasta & Ibasa tacos to name a few... all have been pretty good. My favorites are definitely Fire Wings and also Boba time for drinks is the way to go.

I like that they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating because it does get packed on weekends and evenings. I believe they are now open for indoor dining as well so that's nice to know customers are welcome to eat inside (masks are still required though).

Definitely will continue to come back to Haven City because I do really like a few of the vendors they have and the chill vibes!<//review>

This place was so awesome. So many options. It was so hard to decide what to eat. Plus they have an area just to sit back on the couch and chill and a ping pong table. Great vibes!<//text>

<Review>We went here tonight for the Taste of Haven event - pay $30 and get 6 vouchers for sampler dishes at the restaurants of your choice. We enjoyed the experience, and it was a neat way to get introduced to the various restaurants and try different options. My favorite was the Baba K chicken shwarma, and my husband's favorite was the Jojo's braised pork belly rice.

However, the items should have mathematically been worth $5 each, but not all of them were. For example, the Vietnamese sandwich from Lantern was tiny, as was the Jojo's pork belly rice bowl. Although the event was a fun way to try the foods, we wondered after if it would have been cheaper to actually buy small dishes at each place, rather than the whole $30.

Also, we were there 5-6:30pm, and Elmer & Jasper's as well as Belly & Snout were sold out of their voucher products. :(</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Nice place and shopping center. I went for the Virtual Reality place that is at the corner end but ran in to eat. This is a nice size food court with lots of food choices including chicken wings and BurgerIM. They have a huge exterior patio area with live music and the vendors inside sell alcohol. It was packed on a Friday night. They close at 10 pm</Text>< gmap_id>

Love this place to get together with my siblings or friends. There is lots of outdoor seating and a decent variety in food places. I wish there was more variety for dinner/lunch items but there are a few ...and some delicious looking dessert places here!<//text>

<Text>Each time we visit Haven City we are never disappointed. There's so many different delicious choices you can't go wrong. Shrimp Shack and their shrimp boil is delicious and a must try. Don't forget to give into your craving for Mediterranean food at Baba K their lamb shawarma is delicious!< /Text>< pictures>

<text>The experience was amazing. There were so many types of food from all different cultures. The photoshoot opportunities are endless. I went with some friends and we each ordered something to share. We had Shrimp Tacos from Shrimp Shack, Lumpia and Pork belly Sandwich from Belly & Snout and some Hot wings from Fire Wings. They were all delicious and I got to try something’s that were new. We ate outside under an umbrella and seats that were sanitized. They took the coronavirus pandemic seriously and it was a clean and social distancing environment.

This place was easy to find.  There are still a lot of people the parking is full. I had to park far away but it ok. There are a lot of food choices. We tried a couple of restaurants and it was great experience. I saw that there will be more restaurants to come. The place is clean. There are public restroom. There is an outdoor seating area and lots of games for kids and kids at heart. I would recommend this place but don't expect it to be cheap.<//review>< gmap_id>

Great and diverse food court. However, masks aren't strictly enforced and i watched a food service employee prepare poké with his mask below his chin. BobaTime has this drink with butterfly pea tea in it and its amazing.< /text>

Good vibes, lots of options. Room for expansion. It looks like new shops will be moving in soon. Fire Wings has 24oz of Space Dust for only $6!</review>

A bustling hall of food that covers a wide variety of delicacies. I'm sure there's something here that would suit anyone's cravings. The decor is inviting and the inside is spacious, while also offering an abundance of sitting both inside and out. There is also art across the walls throughout that is very cute and sets the mood for the place.<//text>

Great place for new and familiar food places. Not all the venues are open yet but most of them are. The variety is great: tacos, okonomiyaki, sizzling plates, chicken wings, seafood, poke, sushi, burgers, acai bowls and more! There are also dessert shops like bubble milk tea, popsicles and ice cream! It's definitely worth checking out while it's relatively unknown and the lines aren't too long yet. The trickiest part was finding parking out in the front parking lot. There are options to eat inside and there are heat lamps on the outside. A great place if you live in the inland empire and are too lazy to drive out to Anaheim. As an added bonus, there was a live band that did some great covers. There are also places for you to hang out with your friends and family ~ ping pong tables, watching sports and some fun arcade games like basketball and skeeball.</Text>

<review>Nice place. Hardly any traditional food places. I would say on the fringe. I ate at a pork sandwich place. It was 5 out of 10. The place was clean. Lots of empty suites. No indoor seating right now but you can eat outside. There are a few tables with benches. Also most of the places are kinda pricey.  Many dishes over $10. So prepare to drop $30 for 2 people.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Great food lab in Rancho Cucamonga, the coffee at & COFFEE is amazing they make there own in-house syrups using top ingredients. Shokunin has the best sushi I have ever had, blows Nobu out of the water! Everything inside Haven City is great from a fresh bowl from Onon to Mediterranean from Baba k. Always something great and new to try.<//Text>

<time>1594168201037< /time><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>A very cool concept like a hip food court but with a bar!  Very reminiscent of something you would find in Singapore.  Tons of options but mostly skewing twords Asian culture.  Dessert options as well, looks like in normal circumstances they have some arcade games. There is a bar with full alcohol which is really cool a really nice outside seating area with plenty of shade and grass.obviously during covid-19 is not at full capacity. I'm sure once things go back to normal this will be a pretty cool Hangout. I only tried one place which was pretty tasty although the prices are not exactly what I would call cheap, the place I tried I kind of question their for the price but it was tasty.  It's def a foodie place.  Worth anotger visit for sure.</Text>< Pictures>

The Food Court has a great variety of food businesses; Asian, American, Italian etc. Very clean; although with the Covid 19 still around, they have table, but no chairs. Still a good place to get take-out.<//text>

It has free ping pong tables, free wifi, arcade games, and a comfortable outdoor seating area. You could spend hours here trying the different food and drinks.

Looks nice from the entrance. Interior is spacious, but is essentially a white box. Nice variety of vendors to choose from. No new standout restaurants, but good choices, nonetheless.
Would really like to see the outdoor patio area enhanced for night use. Overall, an excellent use of a vacancy, and hopefully will be able to attract more business interest to the area.< /review>

<Review>I'm really enjoying the food and drink choices you can get there.

I do have to point out that some workers at certain restaurants don't care about their masks and wear them under their nose, or even under their mouth. And then they brush you off when you request that they put the mask on. I get it, it's annoying, it's hot, but we all do it. Why would somebody, that serves me food, be an exception?</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Edit
Haven City Market is just following covid protocol. 4 stars updated to 5.<//Review></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>It's finally open!!!
I've been waiting for this market to open for my foodie needs. So far this place impressed me.

Sunday weekend opening was packed so I decided to visit again Monday lunch and it wasn't madly crowded but there were still good number of people.

Here are the food places that are open as of 10/28/19:
1. Acai Life Superfoods
2. Baba K
3. Belly Snout
4. BurgerIM
5. Cauldron
6. Churrobar & Coffee
7. Crepes de Paris
8. Ibasa
9. It's Boba Time
10. Native Son Ale House
11. Oke Poke
12. Oko Yummy
13. ON + ON
14. Popbar
15. Sizzling Place
16. Shokunin
17. Shrimp Shack

Coming soon:
1. HoneyMee
2. Jojo's Kitchen Taiwan Eats
3. Lantern Vietnamese Cafe
4. Pan Pasta
5. Umai Savory Hot Dogs

I glanced at each of the restaurant menus and everything is fairly reasonably priced. Not everything from some menus are available though because they just opened this weekend.

I tried:
1. Belly Snouts' pork belly fries and it was tasty with lots of meats and the fries were crispy.
2. Ibasa's Al pastor and carne asada tacos - they used delicious corn tortilla and both meats were seasoned well... But they didn't have corn yet.
3. Oko Yummy seafood- it was freshly made with lots of seafood. It was good especially the sauce they use.
4. Churrobar's plain churro and one dipped in white chocolate. They were freshly made so it was nice and hot and crunchy. They didn't have ice cream though...
5. It's boba time's Jasmine milk tea was spot on with soft yummy boba.

There are plenty of tables inside and outside which both has their own nice perks:
--Inside: 2 giant white screens where they show NFL games, 2 ping pong tables, some arcade games including 4-player pacman and of course nice and cool indoor AC.
--Outside: play area for the kids, outdoor games including giant connect 4, heaters for cold nights, and fresh air.

I would definitely be back to try more food here.
I'm so glad Rancho now has an awesome foodie market! BUT WHERE'S THE RAMEN AT!?!?!

(Parking is decent size but might be crowded on weekends and dinner time so I recommend parking across the street and just walk)<//Text><name>Sarlyn Palmer< /name><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Well done Haven City Market, well done . This place is beautiful at night when all the lights outside are on. Inside is so well lit and inviting, the space is well designed with what feels like a free flowing layout. There are some free ping pong tables that my son and I enjoyed playing for a few minutes while waiting for food. If you've ever had those nights where you can't quite decide what you wanna eat? Well Haven City Market would be a great place to go, you'll definitely find something here to satisfy those cravings.<//text>

I've tried a few places here. On + on would be one of my favorite. They have clean and healthy options. I like the outside area. It is nice and relaxing. Some of the food options can be a little pricey. It just like a mall set up but with  FOOD!  Cute place to check out, but in my opinion just a giant food court.</text>

This place is great. They have good variety of food choices. Perfect for a date or family outing, they have table tennis available for free and a lot of seating. I highly recommend this place, it's our new spot. Tried a few of the places in here and their food is great.<//Text>

Weirdest place ever. It's just a mini mall but just for food
It's a decent place where young people and single desperate Asian ladies take their overly aged rich white boyfriend's to, for them to be more cultured.
Anyways it's actually a pretty decent place for 15 mins then youre bored< /text>

<text>Lots of different places to eat. It seems crowded but its not too bad. Easy to find seating, lines are quick and food doesn't take too long. Food was great, lots of parking too. Great place to visit on a Saturday night with the family or for a date. Oh and there's live music too!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c3351592ed31d5:0xdbea509c7612ba35</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is such a fun place to grab some great food and hang out with friends! There is tons of open seating, vendor and random things to do. I just know that come spring time their outdoor seating is going to be packed!! Only complaint?? You can't eat here for less than $10. And if you're thinking dessert to? Add another good chunk of change. Not cheap, but oh so delicious and fun!</review>

Very cool place , lots of places to eat and to have delicious desserts.  Very cool place to take your loved one or your whole family. They have a huge projector with football or whatever is trending playing,  2 ping pong tables and a huge outdoor place to enjoy the view.<//review>

<review>It was just okay.  I understand the place is still developing but its really hidden and I wouldn't have known about it if I was driving by.  I was browsing through the selection of food and I missed some because of the construction.  Other than that I was alright.  I would wait till everything is finished tho.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv6Mrl1T6SMsuGG1I1UsoKuDW2Sunr-D3NgAX1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c3351592ed31d5:0xdbea509c7612ba35<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>It's okay for a quick bite but if you're looking for something more quiet, this definitely is not for you. There is a bar and open air eatery. Great place for a friends get together. The restaurants are more Asian oriented but there is a taco shop,  burger place and a hot wings joint.</review>< user_name>

<review>Highly recommended. The only problem is parking and how crowded it is, its still new so its really busy right now. But there's a lot of good choices and different ethnic foods. I personally had Belly and Stout and On + On. Also there's an outdoor courtyard that plays live music and a few games to play. If you're interested i would recommend you check it out</review>< Time>

Its a spacious food lab with several food choices. My son is a fan of Burger IM, my husband goes for the wings at Fire Wings and i try different spots. Like Belly and Snout, love their Belly fries. They have big screens with something always playing, like Sunday football.<//review>

It was super fun. I went with my family my boys were able to play arcade game plus there's a ping pong table that we were able to use for free! There's all kinds of bars and my boyfriend was able to walk around with his beer and enjoy the boys having a blast! I will definitely go back.</Review>

Love the variety of food items available!  It's definitely a crowded locale.  That may die down in a while.  We enjoyed what we chose to eat tacos and crepes.  The atmosphere is very energetic, full of people, noise and music.  I only wish there was more seating.  Overall though very enjoyable.< /text>

This place is great! Multiple bars to hang out at and plenty of common eating areas once you decide from an excellent choice of food. Outdoor area has heated and yard games. Perfect for families, quick lunch break, or meeting your friends to hang out.<//text>

Due to it's popularity, I suggest showing up as early as you can. As the day progresses, all of the vendors start to run out of product.

Otherwise, quite pleased with my experiences and will continue to eat here.</review>< Resp>

<text>This place is like Grand Central Market but with a more family vibe to it. It's was the best idea to develop a indoor place  when there is a variety of reasonably price places to eat. It also looks like most of the establishments are family owned, so if your about supporting that, it a great place to be. They also play sports games on a huge projector and had a DJ playing.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

It was super fun. I went with my family my boys were able to play arcade game plus there's a ping pong table that we were able to use for free! There's all kinds of bars and my boyfriend was able to walk around with his beer and enjoy the boys having a blast! I will definitely go back.</review>

Place is awesome.. All kinds of food from all over.. Seafood boil, sushi, churros, coffee, acai, poke bowls, burgers and famous chef inspired spots.  A must if you are in the area.. They have an outside area for kids.. Outside seating for adults.  Tvs everywhere and games for all to play like ping pong and basketball hoops.. Really fun time.. Check it out..</text>

<Text>It's a big hype. A lot of these places are chains, and a few of them are absolutely dead because prices are 3x more than local competition, which isn't acceptable if you have 0 reputation.

Overall, the three stars isn't a BAD rating. Just needs improvement. Strong point is that it's very clean and there's constantly at least one person walking around taking care of trash and stuff.

Suggestion: sound absorbing material/foam on ceiling/walls because it's incredibly loud and almost impossible to have a conversation when everything echoes in the small space.<//Text>< UserId.>

<text>Haven City is a warehouse of several eateries mostly of oriental cuisine. I went to check it out not eating at any of the places. There were about at least 14 to 15 different eateries with seating available,  a ping pong table, a full screen tv with seats, a popsicle vendor, ice cream frozen while you wait, Wild Wings, etc. Its a place opened once before Christmas. Family oriented, teens, parents , elderly would love to come mingle and eat. Outside patio seating. I observed a lot, huh?< /text>< pics>

Disgusting eating areas, When it gets busy tables trade hands so fast the staff doesn’t even bother wiping tables<//Review>

Thank you for your feedback.\nOur tables get turned over to the next guests very quickly, so it's very difficult for our janitors to know which tables need wiping.\n\nIf you find yourself at a dirty table, please don't hesitate to let any of our staff know so we can get it cleaned for you as soon as possible.\n\nWe hope you give us another try soon!"}</Resp>

<Review>Great new place in the heart of Rancho Cucamonga. Food choices seem to be of premium quality at an average price point. Good alternative to the usual past food variety. Overall good experience thus far.</Review><user_id>110813244126066010385< /user_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

<Review>This place is so cool. There is so many  different types of food.  Baba K was really good. And the ice cream churros. I strongly encourage everyone to try out Haven City Market.

<Review>For the past year or so I've been passing the construction zone of, supposedly, some place called Haven City Market. I never thought they'd actually finish it or get enough places to rent spots. Lo and behold, it's open. I was excited to see what kept us waiting so long and, to be honest, I'm not disappointed. I quite liked it actually. The Chipotle style restaurants with a variety of food types ranging from Mexican to Asian fusion looked cool, unique, and new. In addition, there are plenty of dessert and drink options like boba, beer, cocktails, etc. The aesthetic is industrial mixed with plants which I'm into. I especially enjoyed the "backyard" where you can sit outside and enjoy the weather.  Overall, great experience (especially with the food from On-On Fresh Asian) and I look forward to trying some other places out.< /Review>< Rating>

Great variety of food options! For being a new facility the bathrooms we surprisingly dirty to my standards and the floor was sticky in more than one location.  This is our second visit since they have opened. We went on a Wednesday night and it was not extremely busy.   Our first visit my daughter got sick at Burger IM, it was opening weekend and places were running out of food, it could have been mishandled food with a new place getting slammed so we went again tonight and so far so good.  The wings place and shrimp shack were both tasty, I also tried cauldron which was extremely filling.  Churros are better than waffles in my opinion.< /text>

Great variety of foods here, great place to take your kids. I personally loved the adobo fries and calamanse drink. Kids loved the churros and ice cream. There were also ping pong tables and a open area for your kids to play outside.< /Review>

I enjoy the environment, but this is the second time I've gone and the food was just OK, we did have to wait a little longer then expected even after we walked around and came back we still had to wait. Like I said,  enjoyed  the atmosphere of everything but  it does come down to the food!!!!!</text>

Place is awesome.. All kinds of food from all over.. Seafood boil, sushi, churros, coffee, acai, poke bowls, burgers and famous chef inspired spots.  A must if you are in the area.. They have an outside area for kids.. Outside seating for adults.  Tvs everywhere and games for all to play like ping pong and basketball hoops.. Really fun time.. Check it out..<//review>

<review>Very disappointed with the lack of ethnic diversity at the Market Place. A dominance of Asian food and Asian vendors even if they were not selling Asian food.
Our culture is moving to a more inclusive environment and the market place didn’t reflect that.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Rancho Cucamonga finally has such a food mall like packing district @ Anaheim. I love the diversity of food here. You can have Americans burger, Mediterranean kabob, Taiwanese braised pork in rice, Japanese okonomiyaki, etc here. And the place is clean with lots of seats. Unlike packing district at Anaheim, the parking lot is big so no worry about finding a space. There is kid playground outside of restaurant area. And there is table tennis table inside which is fun. If you like watching some major sport event. They have projector tv broadcasting games. The only thing is to get more restroom. I don't think one for men and one form women is enough</text><Date>1578954502121</Date>< user_name>

A lot of foodie selections. I had some dan dan noodles that was a bit spicy,but it was excellent because of the cold day which lay outside. I also had a watermelon boba which gave my taste buds a rather expressive feeling of relief sotheness. There are coined basketball courts to shoot competing to get high scores. There was a boba milk tea stand for various types of milk teas. They have seats outside to lounge. Many pizza options are also available in the city market. This place is at a great location in Ontario. Parking is available almost everywhere,so there's no problem with that,a lot of access. This is the first time I been here and hopefully the chain keeps on going.</review>

<time>1576343392152</time><rating>4< /rating><review>It's different than what we were used to as far as a food court. The outdoor eating area can't be beat.I would return just to sit outside. Doesn't have the hustle bustle of the mall so that was nice. I'm not real big on Asian food so the selection was not the greatest for me. I opted for Burger IM which was delicious, but the portion size was laughably small. I could have eaten double so for 8 bucks a burger not including fries and drink I'll probably just be headed back to In and Out. I would have given five stars but the selection of restaurants was just not for me. Coming from the supersize  era, gen x'ers will not be impressed. Happy Grubbing.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>This place is a food and fun experience in one building!  There are burgers and fries, poke, crepes, a churro bar, dessert bar, an actual sports bar with adult only beverages, a ton of asian fusion foods, a superfoods spot, healthy asian spot, crab and corn on the cob, burritos and Mexican food, ice cream, and multiple flat screen TVs with sports running, awesome music tracks playing, ping pong table, mini bowling and basketball games, and a ton of places to eat indoor and outdoor. During summers they hold live band music on the patio and Special events.  The outdoor patio has both concrete and grassy areas to sit and eat and there are plenty of opportunities to meet new friends you sit across from during your dining experience.  The parking lot is big but always packed so go early! Handicapped parking is also available for those in need. The building and outdoor patio are  wheelchair accessible but the doors are not automatic so some assistance needed there.  Food prices are pretty reasonable and service is typically quick if you don't go at lunchtime for the local work force from 11AM to 1PM; parking is better too before and after the lunch rush Monday through Friday.</review><response>None</response><Date>1578874873783<//Date><user_name>Tess Reid</user_name>< gmap_id>

Probably best not to advertise hours of 11am when all of the restaurants inside say they'll take orders at 11:30am.  This is a fault of each individual food stall but regardless it would be better to reinforce rules to each food stall.< /text>

It is not bad, but just pricy. If the food/drinks here can lower down 1 to 2 dollar, it would be a great place. But for now, it is super midiocore w.r.t the price.<//Review>

<Text>This place is an awesome addition to Rancho  Cucamonga!!!  I highly recommend checking it out. There are lots of little cafe style foods inside the market place, along with boba, coffee, desserts, even liquor! They also have ski ball, pingpong tables, and an outdoor recreation area. The only downside is having to choose which spots to try first!!  We ate at the Happy Bento next door (sooooo good!) And for dessert visited the market place for delicious coffee and VEGAN churros.  We will definitely be back and I am excited to take more of my friends/family here!< /Text></record>

Nice ambulance, lack of more selection, mediocre food. Overpriced. I really wanted to love this place. We waited for a year a more for it to finally open and...its just ok. I live right up the street so I will continue to visit and support small, local buisness but they have to strp up there game. Lunch truck, gourmet prices minus the gourmet. We need some more street tacos!  BTW...they did a nice job on the interior and patio area.<//Text>

Haven City Market is a popular food court located in Civic Center Plaza, rancho Cucamonga. They have so many options - nitro ice cream, salad bowls, churro in ice cream, sushi, tacos, BBQ and so on. This is the place where you go with the group of friends who all have different tastes. Everyone walks away happy here.  All the ingredients are fresh and the food is tasty. The price of the food is very reasonable. They have sufficient seating (both indoor and outdoor) arrangements though finding a suitable place for parking is challenging when you get there. However, this place has enough entertaining food options for even the pickiest eater.<//Review>

I like the options and the atmosphere, can get a little crowded find seating early if you have a big party.</Text>

It's like a food court without the mall. The Mexican tacos from Ibasa were okay, had a lot of fat. $2 something for 1 tiny taco that wasn't even that good.
A lot of Asian choices.<//text>

Went here the second weekend after opening.  Most places open with more coming soon.  Ate outside because inside seemed much louder.  Parking gets worse later in the evening.<//Review>
