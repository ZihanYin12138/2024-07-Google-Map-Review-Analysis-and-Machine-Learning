< Review>
So disappointed. Ordered tacos and dinamitas. The dinamitas were burnt and greasy. I asked them to separate my food from my friends. They didn't. Next UNSANITARY. They had the salsas placed on the center of 2 folding tables that customers were sitting at with no masks. One guy was coughing, sure he was spraying the salsas. Come on COVID people. Have a separate table. Dont mind paying good money for good food. They fall short in many ways. Won't return nor recommend.<//Review>

It used to be good back when the owner Gilberto was there. The current service it's not the best not to mention the drop in food quality. The consomé was really greasy and lack flavor. The tacos dinamita where burned and not crispy. I also order some birria tacos the meat was really dry and also had no flavor.  I will not be eating here again unless Gilberto is there.< /text>

This place is my favorite. I go to many restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The stuff is very attentive and the food they serve is so yummy. I am always happy to have a decent meal here. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Review>

Very unorganized and unpunctual. Had my family waiting for more than an hour for him to come and set up. The food took forever to come out and didn't even get everything I had asked for. Very disappointed with the customer service and the food in overal, wouldn't recommend coming here. There's a WAYYY BETTER TACO TRUCK, Tijuana tacos !! This is the place to check out instead.</text>

<Review>A full review eventually -- but I noticed while posting a photo just now an absurd review from someone indicating that the meat here has "no flavor." Please ignore this person. Anyone who would state that is either a dishonest competitor or knows 0% about this cuisine if that is his conclusion after eating the food here. This is possibly the best barbacoa de borrego I've had in Southern California, and certainly the rendition that brings the most flavor. Taquizas Gilberto is a treasure.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOexWJjRXOjEkm9s1xoZypONZXXrhPoby7vsdFv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

To be honest only the size of the taco is the difference from other places
The consome is poor in meat, garbanzo,
I think you have to help your self with the cilantro and onion because we ask for to go order and we didn't get any
Good luck< /review>

To taste the dynamite tacos you have to get there early, 7 to 8 am! Saturday and Sunday only. Other wise you only get regular huge birria lamb and consome which any way,taste so good!</review>

<Review>Went there due to the hype of the best birria but was disappointed. The meat had no flavor and was just dripping too much oil. I'm a fan of oily stuff but not today. Drove 45mins to check it out and drove back home disappointed. Definently not going back. To those that love it keep going. To those looking for great birria, stay away.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Finally caught them while visiting LA!  Get there early because there was a line before the truck arrived! The dynamite sticks are a must try.  Squeeze a lot of lime on it yum!</Review>

<text>San Diego is expensive, so Mexican stands like this are a relief from the big receipt meals. It's sort of in the middle of an industrial and residential area.

If you're staying in the Old Town area then this is a good bet. The Old Town tourist traps are pricier. Plenty of parking, on and off street parking. MCRD families, this is a great spot.</text>< pics>

I can go both ways on this. I tried carne asada tacos. Here is the plus, large and the beef is soft. The tortilla is from the grocery store not authentic. But it's filling. Order two of you are very hungry. Rice flavorful. The negative: Now only 4 spots for parking and lady in the front lacks  manners. She takes your orders. I think they have good flavors. But I don't return to places with non welcoming staff ever. Myself and everyone who walks in; we bring business and keep your place open. If we are not treated right, our buck will never find it's way to your pocket ever again. Just how we roll.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Really bad service , I called at 9:55 am for my pick up chilaquilies but when I got there at 10:15 they where still not done so I asked them “what’s the point of me putting ina pick up order if your not gonna make them “ and he said for me to go somewhere else if I can find better service . He didn’t say sorry he just told me he didn’t care . It was the cook who sometimes takes the order in the front . Never coming here again .<//Review>

<Review>We love this place for a quick fresh meal on nights we don't want to cook. They say they have the best soup in town, they really do. We've tried many items on their menu. The a la Carter chile rellano is a fave, their fish tacos are bomb, and the basic bean rice and cheese burrito is a go-to item for me.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><time>1606501106444</time></record>

Food is a 11/10. One of the best small Mexican food establishments in all of old town. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat and want to eat some authentic Mexican food this is the spot.

The tables, however, were uncleaned and a little sticky and the customer service want the best. But the food was just absolutely amazing. I highly recomend it< /text>

Las Brasas is an amazing place for Mexican food. Even though it looks like a hole in the wall, it was recommended to my by multiple locals. They have a big menu. If you have never tried it, have a California burrito, as San Diego is known for it.<//Review>

Food quality has diminished through the years. They use canned beans that were dry upon serving. The Adobada burrito was sweet and gross. Limited seating. Unfortunately they don't offer a public restroom making it difficult to take children. Limited parking</Text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>This is a small, local eatery serving authentic Mexican food. VERY casual. Large menu which includes dinners with rice and beans and a la carte entrees and sides. My husband ordered the beef taco and cheese enchilada dinner with a free small order of chips. He said it was very good and was about $8. I ordered 3 carnitas mini-tacos for $5.99.  The mini tacos appeared to be a double-walled corn tortilla with a small amount of finely cut fatty meat. It had some finely chopped  parsley on it. I would not order the mini-tacos again.

After receiving our order, we ate outdoors at simple tables under an awning. There was also simple indoor seating of about 4 tables.

Our hotel recommended this eatery.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Large servings at very reasonable prices. The food is solid, lightly seasoned, and comes with plenty of toppings. The chimichangas will easily feed two at around $6.<//text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>WORST SERVICE EVER FROM THE OWNER, Went to eat like I have on many occasions and this time they did not get my order correct so I took it back and the owner wanted to argue with me about how I placed my order then didn't want to give me my money back when he said he would not make my order over the way I ordered it in the first place, After going back and forth he finally gave me my money but said and I quote " I don't ever want to see your face here again" NO CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THE OWNER PERIOD! stay away from this place bad vibes and the owner does not care about the quality of his food or the correctness of his customers orders. Just another greedy business owner that only cares about the money not how he gets the money!</review>< Pics>

<Text>I called to order out and told him my order and the guy who answer me was real rude and told me if that was it every order I asked for. Them he said "estoy bien ocupado  eso es todo" I was like, if he was busy, why the hell would he answer  and being rude to future customers...I was going to bring my family to eat here on the weekend. But now I won't order here again. Sad., Because they have good food. For the rest of the place it's good. Just he made it bad.....<//Text>< Pictures>

Very helpful service personnel.  Even in these times of business being handled behind closed doors and over the internet and phone, they were polite, knowledgeable and very courteous.  We are looking forward to doing business here in the next months.  Thanks for working and helping us to get our unit available, open and ready.<//Text>

I have used, as well as my husband, this storage place for almost 30yrs on and off.  Being in the military we have needed it for moving as well as storing extra or seasonal things.  The Staff has always been kind.  Elvira has usually been the person I deal with and she is very friendly and helpful.  My son who is now in the Navy over seas is having his stuff stored here.  I've never had an issue with my things being stored and feel completely safe with leaving my things here.< /text>

We are glad to hear that you have been taken care of for so long by our staff, we do our best to make sure every customer feels important and we appreciate your loyalty to us.  We also support our troops and appreciate the sacrifice your son has given to keep us all safe, we hope you have a great day!'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

Very accommodating, the unit I initially rented was a winding route and slightly awkward with my disability. They were quick to exchange it for one with more direct access.<//Text>

A car ran into the place destroying my artwork and other electronics. They made me sign papers saying I couldn't go after them for the incident that it was a third party fault. My artwork was lost/stolen/destroyed by the construction company or the car. Really bad experience.< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>The place is full of mice so if you're thinking about renting a storage unit in this place DON'T. Management does not hold themselves responsible if your things are damaged due to the severe mice infestation they have, all you will hear is an Im sorry and there's nothing we can do. I give this place the worst rating.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d94eea65f37acf:0x855db9fc292bbfa9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My dog, Chelsea, had knee surgery replacement on both of her hind legs at a different veterinarian in November of 2020. Unfortunately, in late December of the same year, she fell while I was taking her out to do her deeds and she broke her right hind leg. My dog was crying and shaking. I simply could not drive all the way to the initial veterinarian to take care of my dog.

I Yelped full-service veterinarians in the Los Angeles area and found Economico Animal Hospital had 5-star reviews. After reading the reviews and the stories, I decided this was the place to take Chelsea.

Dr. Hwang conducted his veterinarian assessment and was very honest about the procedures, costs and realistic expectations about Chelsea's ability to be able to utilize that hind leg at 100%. He also mentioned the possibility of amputation if the situation got worst. He was caring, honest and his bed side manners where on point. He also tried to accommodate the cost since he knew I had already spent an arm and a leg on Chelsea's prior surgery. I agreed to the treatment and Chelsea ended up getting a metal piece on her hind leg to help strengthen the broken bone area. The healing process has been long but worth it.

As of January 22, 2021, Chelsea is now able to fully walk on her four legs and she is as happy and active as before. The only difference is that when she runs, she sometimes hops. I think it's because the metal on her leg doesn't allow her to coordinate her legs as before. But I take that any day over a leg amputation or her limping. She is doing amazing.  Dr. Hwang is a kind, caring miracle worker.

Please note that although they have tons of customers, they process their customers fairly quickly. All of their staff is caring, loving and honest. You will not be disappointed by their prices and specially their great quality. Can't thank them enough for their work and dedication.</Text>

I had found a stray kitten about 2 months ago, and she had some type of URI. I had called I not lying but I called 6 places to see if they would take walk ins according to the pandemic they were not taking walk ins. I had posted the picture of the kitty and I submitted it on facebook, to see if anyone would be able to help me out.  Some wonderful lady told me about this place and the person who answered the call was really helpful and she was able to tell me that I could go at last minute. I brought her here, and they took us right in & they examined her, and gave her medications. The doctor was really friendly including the staff, they even gave me some toys for her. I will definitely come back here for emergency, & I was able to find the kitty a loving home. Thank you Economico & all the wonderful staff</Text>

1st day shopping around for a new Vet. 1st impressions considering we're in the middle of a pandemic not bad techs take the pet inside while the owner remains in the car. After exam Doctor comes to the car to discuss findings. They didn't seem money hungry their prices seemed fair. That's a good thing because I'm not employed at the moment. Made several suggestions that fit in my budget. Overall pleasant experience<//Text>

Staff was friendly but not as knowledgeable... not even the vet.. what they advised for my pup was wrong...thankfully I got a second opinion and he got treated properly and doing very well!  Two stars cause Steve was super helpful when he  brought my pup out.

Side note: whoever does the marketing for you guys as far as responding to bad reviews they need to be FIRED. Copying a response as far as what was done for ONE client and using that same response to comment under whoever left a bad review is NOT how you improve a business. Im throwing that out there before your marketer gets on here lying.< /review>

Pre-pandemic, I loved this place. Post-pandemic, I love this place even more. They have truly been innovative and thoughtful in how they deal with their customers and their customer's fur children. I couldn't be more pleased with their safe and efficient, yet kind and gentle, approach with my pet. I have spoken with two technicians and a vet, all while sitting in my car. The transparency, care, and time taken is incredible!</Review>

I went to the clinic for an emergency, my dog ​​had a deep wound and was bleeding a lot, I went to this "economic" clinic and since they were going to close they were going to charge me approximately more than 600 dollars to be able to check my dog.  In this pandemic, do you think I had more than 600 dollars in my wallet ,apart from that there is an additional charge for anesthesia.  DISAPPOINTED. I know it's business but come on...  Thank God I was able to stop the bleeding with natural medicine.<//review>

<review>1. Didn’t get results of my dogs tests until days later; when I called. I never received a call from them.
2. Doctor didn’t explain results throughly.
3. Medication wasn’t working, my dog was getting worse.
4. I called doctor back and he said that according to the “most up to date” results that the medicine my pet was taking, the one he prescribed, was not going to work. I understand that results come up after but I wasn’t getting updated of anything. I had to be behind them to let me know what was going on.
5. I had to waste more money on more medicine that didn’t even end up working either.
6. The doctor scared me saying that my dog could die with the virus she had gotten.</review>< pictures>

So my dog was having problems with opening his mouth. I called and they suggested a couple of options, I could make an appointment or do a walk-in. They told me I would walk in from the morning until 1 pm, then they're closed for lunch from 1 to 2, and then opened again for walk ins from 2 to 5. I chose to walk in and signed in at 2 pm. They checked my pet in within 30 minutes and took his vitals. The vet came out to explain the procedures we could do. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. They explained the costs to me and my dogs all better now. I like this place they were quick, caring and effective.< /Review>

Dr.Yoon has seen and treated my cat before. Dr.Yoon knew the condition my cat had was incurable, but gave me false hope. Prescribed harsh medication to a weak older cat without warning me of any possible side effects. I had no idea I was poisoning my cat. 48 hours after giving my cat the medication (prednisolone and metronidazole) he died. Had to rush him to the emergency to be euthanized.

The last two days of my cats life he suffered all because of Dr.Yoon. He should have warned of the possible side effects so I could have made an informed decision. He just cared about making money. I could have made the last days of my cats life better, instead he suffered unnecessarily.

Dr.Yoon is unprofessional, uncaring, greedy and uninformative. He did not think about what I wanted for my cat. He chose what would make him money. After paying $600 for the visit I had to pay $300 for euthanizing and cremation of my beloved baby.

Sofia the manager is also unprofessional and lacks sympathy for pet owners.

Staff also uninformed and does not treat matters with urgency. Communication skills are lacking.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had a nightmare experience with Dr. Yoon. I was new to the area and looking for quality care for my senior dog. The friendly girl who answers the phone and the affordable prices made me give them a shot. They did bloodwork and X-rays and Dr. Yoon Lic #20733 said my 12 year old dog needed to be on pain medication for arthritis. I was a little hesitant - mostly because Dr. Yoon failed to explain any type of care plan for my dog. I didn’t understand if he wanted this to be short term or something he thought she might need to take regularly because of her age. As a naturally concerned customer I tried to ask for clarification because I was unfamiliar about pain medicine for dogs and possible side effects but Dr. Yoon suddenly got very aggressive and raised his voice with me. He actually got so close to me and my vehicle that I asked him to step back. It was very shocking and strange...maybe he thought I was questioning his decision but I really was just looking for him to explain his recommendation. He was aggressive and hostile. He actually mocked me and said “do you think your dog is going to open the pill bottle when you’re not looking and get addicted? I offer you no sympathy.” Bizarre and unprofessional to say the least. He also wanted to do bloodwork for my dog once a month which for a senior dog is unheard of...Unfortunately I believe this place is all about money - I alone would be contributing $180 a month to them for bloodwork and medicine. Every single time I called for a refill I was told I would receive a confirmation in 24 hours and that never happened. My dog ran out of her pain medication once because Dr. Yoon and crew were too “busy” to approve it. Another time I called back because I didn’t get the refill confirmation and was out of medication and was told that I needed to go in for bloodwork - yet I was given NO warning whatsoever - even though I asked him day 1 how often she would need blood work and he said he cannot tell me that. So if I wasn’t able to take my dog in that day and pay for bloodwork she would have been left in pain because of Dr. Yoon’s erratic requests. I felt like I had to chase them down once a week to get her medicine refilled. At one point I asked Dr. Yoon if I could work with another doctor and he said “No - there are a lot of other vets you can go to” suggesting I leave Económico. Dr. Yoon acted as a bully and had terrible communication and people skills. You hear of doctors having a “god” like complex and I think this is the case. Unfortunately he doesn’t seem to be able to distinguish between a customer asking normal questions about her dogs care and someone challenging his big ego.</text>

<response>{'time': 1615331731008, 'text': 'Let me begin by saying that we will accept a negative review from you, rather than having another exchange with you again.\nThe doctor called you the following day to go over the bloodwork results. You were informed about the risks with long term effects that this can have on the patient. The doctor informed you about follow up bloodwork to check vital organs with long-term use of medications. You asked about addiction for the patient; while addiction for humans is based on an inability to over indulge with no self-control; animals do not experience this mental disability. You were concerned about using the medication and the doctor went over the side effects. The doctor gave you his best recommendation and only a weeks’ worth of medication due to your concerns with addiction for pets and long-term usage.\nIn regards, to bloodwork you requested a refill of the medication for longer quantity at a time; due to the longer usage of medication you were informed that you would need to follow up with bloodwork to check vital organs values, such as liver and kidneys. This is something that was expressed to you by the doctor. Erratic behavior is best described as lacking or inconsistent; yet the doctor informed you of the need to be consistent with bloodwork rechecks. This was not a random procedure that was developed.  When you contacted the hospital, our staff would speak with you on the phone for long periods of time, answering your questions and concerns. You requested refills of medications which were given to you within the given time frame.\nIt is unfortunate that you find us to be concerned about money, where we tried to be financially conscious for you in regards to your pet. Based on your previous hospital notes it appears that you were informed about sedation for the patient every time due to aggressive behavior. Which came with additional costs.  We informed you that we think it may be best to limit the amount of sedation for the patient, saving you extra expenses.  We were successful in providing care without having to sedate your pet.  We prioritize care for the patient over any finances.\nWe gave our recommendations and service to the best of our ability. Our staff works long hours to provide care for their patients. We work days straight at a time to always be available to clients.

{'time': 1613522547203, 'text': 'While we do not normally give a response to most reviews, we felt the need to respond based on this prejudice post.\nWe are saddened to be reviewed based not on quality of our services but on a quote. Unfortunately, you judged and created an opinion on a sum, rather than the actual capacity of the staff and doctor. If you compare our pricing to that of a low-cost directed hospital than that of a standard veterinarian hospital than you are inadequately comparing pricing. Our standards are incomparable to that of a “low-cost clinic.” If you compare our prices to private/emergency hospitals within our area then you will find that we are reasonability priced for the services provided. Nonetheless, when we do perform dentistry or orthopedic surgeries than the doctor is considered a dentist or orthopedic surgeon respectively. If you were to want to have a Board-Certified Orthopedic Surgeon (DACVS) then you would take your pet to a Specialty Animal Hospital. The hospital’s mentioned usually use relief doctors to perform surgeries and see patients. When we perform orthopedic surgeries, we use a C-Arm to assist during surgery; which is something that is almost exclusively used at Specialty Animal Hospitals and by Board-Certified Veterinarians use during surgery. This is almost unheard of for a general practice to have let alone offer their clients.  Our doctor very comfortably expressed how he is able to do the surgery and has also had to routinely repair incorrectly done surgeries from “low-cost clinics.” However, if a client does not feel comfortable with us performing the surgery then you have every right to go to another hospital.\nWe stand by our name because we offer the clients high quality services, use the latest technology, a great surgical suite and experienced doctors. We are consistently expanding our skills and adding new equipment so that we can offer more services while being cost efficient for our clients.\n\nNonetheless, we are glad that you found a hospital that was able to treat your pet. We will continue to do our best to provide our clients with the best care and service we can.'}</Resp>
<Review>I am sad to give these guys only 1 star. But that is what they deserve. The staff comes off very friendly however do not be fooled this place will OVERCHARGE you. Please do your own research and do not ripped off. I went in for physical/oral exam for my pet. They quoted me $1,000 for dental,blood, extractions, and anesthesia. Which is not reasonable at all!North figueroa animal hospital, Kinder for Rescue, or Casillas veterinary hospital has way cheaper rates. Economico Animal Hospital please change your name because you do not deserve that name.. I am sorry. To make matters worse when the actual vet recommended my dog to have a FHO surgery and he said he was not a ortho surgeon but he can do the surgery. I was very confused as why he was telling me HE could do the surgery even though he was not an orthopedic surgeon. The vet ended up getting very offended and said " I don't need to prove myself to you that I can do the surgery if you would like to go else where you can". How about the next time you want to do a surgery on a animal you make sure your qualified by the board to do so? That would be a decent thing to do. I found a place that will dog my dog's fho surgery and he is an actual orthopedic surgeon and at a much cheaper rate. I am very disappointed and will not go back to this place or recommend anyone to bring there pets here..< /Review><date>1613403946257<//date>< pictures>

Fast and kind service. The main vet always gives you a rundown of everything your pet is going to need and what they're going to do. Services are decently priced and not too expensive. Best time to come is in the morning, it gets very busy midday.</review>

ok so far so good!  Reasonable pricing, not cheap so they will probably stay open.  Seems organized, alot of help coming in and out making the best of this COVID situation.  I am impressed.  Bringing my other 2 dogs for rabies in a few weeks.  My first dog was diagnosed with Parvo and pulled through, rare but it happened.  They treated him well for being such a big beast baby.</review>

Honestly it’s always about money
Usually people who work with animals are more driven to help the animal but money talks in this establishment
I’m all for paying what the price is but when things go wrong with the procedure or with the after care I felt like I was bothering the doctor with my concerns. My dog is my everything as I’m sure most of you feel the same about your pets.
Thanks for everything but show more love towards your clients that pay your bills< /Text>

I had my baby girl (a chihuahua mix) go in after she was acting weird earlier in the day, i called and spoke with lovely staff and was able to squeeze me in for the next day. Turns out my girl needed surgery ASAP ! And the Dr explained it very well with what he had to do to her, They saved her life and i am very grateful ❤️< /Review>

They were recommended by an emergency physician and I feel truly blessed. My 8 year old cat, BOOTS, needed an extensive emergency surgery that was going to cost $8,000^ to survive. Economicio performed the surgery at a very reasonable price, but more importantly the CARE,CONCERN, GRACIOUSNESS has been above reproach. My previous veterinarian was one of the best I had ever encountered, however he retired in September due to COVID concerns. I was lost at the thought of replacing him. I have found a home for my 5 cats. Thank you, Dr. Yoon and staff,  we love you guys. Darlene Goodwin and Kelsey Jimerson<//text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Our regular vet was all booked up until the end of the month, and this hospital was recommended to us by a friend. I'm so glad we got the chance to try this place out; even with COVID-19 looming, I felt our doggos were still taken care of.

Dr. Yoon, Sofie, and the rest of the team really stepped up and surprised us in handling our pitbull, as she can be a bit aggressive with new people. She was taken care of with no issues!

And of course our husky was just happy to be out and about.

Curbside service is available during COVID-19. We would've stayed inside, but the 2 door coupe was too cramped. Took a few laps while waiting and maintaining social distancing.

Will definitely make this our new go-to hospital!<//Review><Date>1594305532879</Date></record>

<response>{'time': 1590778628502, 'text': 'Let me start by saying that we care deeply for our patients. If we didn’t have “any concern for pets” we wouldn’t provide treatments or services to help them feel better.  Secondly, you came in without an appointment. We took you in as an emergency exam. This is a service that numerous hospitals aren’t even offering clients during this time. However, because we care for the patients and their owners we are willing to take clients in; even if this means the staff has to stay after hours to provide services. In regards to our “overpriced” services. We receive many referrals from other practices, because our prices are a lot less than what most places charge. Certainly, there are other hospitals that may charge less than what we offer and you are within your rights to continue care there. Lastly, you were presented a treatment to help take care of your pet. You declined to do those services and wanted the “minimum that can be done.” We did what we could with the authorization you gave us. Our staff also explained to you the risks of not doing the services as it can lead to further complications. Our VA also highly encouraged you to come the following day to do the services. She was willing to fit you into an already fully booked schedule because she was worried about the pet. Instead you decided to leave a yelp review and not bring the pet in. Nonetheless, we hope that you take your puppy to a hospital that is able to provided the services the pet needs in a price range that is better fitted for you.\n\nBest Regards,\nSofia B. a'}</response>< Pics>

They tried to charge me an outrageous price for an issue my puppy was having with his paw, ended up not doing the procedure and they still charged me $240 for basically nothing.

At a moment's notice I was able to take my doggy here for vaccinations. They took good care of him and did not get mad when he threw up his food from being nervous. He got his shots he got his meds we were in and out in under an hour. That our also included the wait time outside. I don't know if the price was high because this is my first time paying for vaccinations but it didn't hurt my pockets.</review>

<review>Please be warned, this place took our money and did NOT help my dog fully recover. I originally took my pet in because I thought he had an ear infection. First visit I paid almost 1K and the vet said it was something stuck in his ear. Vet then proceeded to “show us the item that was inside his ear.” We left feeling liberated that he was as transparent as we thought he could be.

Since the first visit we’ve taken him back multiple times and spent a lot of money, my pet was put through MULTIPLE ear flushes that made him feel pain, kept being told he had EAR INFECTIONS, but nonetheless my pet would always end up having discomfort in his ear.

This lasted over a year, again my pet still did not recover.

Further, the vet makes you feel like a bad pet parent, he told us part of the reason why he keeps getting ear infections is because we didn’t clean his ear more often.

Took him to another vet today and was told my dog has a RUPTURED EARDRUM.

The vet at económico NEVER gave us this diagnosis.

The only reason we kept going back is because of our first visit, we thought they were being fully transparent with us and we trusted them. Plus we understood that  this issue MIGHT be:
1. Fixed after multiple visits
2. COSTLY

After finding out my dog has a ruptured ear drum I’m left to question if they contributed to his current state by falsely diagnosing him with ear infections (issue went unfixed for longer). I’m also concerned that their attempt to fix his supposed ear infections resulted in his ruptured ear drum.

All in all, I say try another vet before going here.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
One of the doctors is rude! We’ve been there at least 5 times and 3 times one doc was condescending. 3 x they gave my puppies antibiotics and something for allergies as a cover-all without identifying what the puppies had.< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1604362583640, 'text': 'Your pet came into the hospital after 3 months of having an infection in the uterus. You stated that the patient was not eating, lethargic, vomiting, very low energy. We diagnosed your pet with a pyometra. We informed you based on the patient’s current condition, the patient’s age, and diagnosis found and the risk of going into surgery. Pyometra without a surgical approach has an extremely low successful resolution. Without proper immediate treatment the toxic effects from the bacteria will be fatal in most cases. The doctor went over all the risks of surgery, before and after surgery.  We explained the possibility of the patient passing during or after surgery. Any surgical approach always comes with risks, either human or animal. While we do everything within our power to ensure any anesthetic procedure goes smoothly, we cannot give a guarantee that the patient will survive. This is beyond the hands of humans. We are sorry that your pet passed away. We completed the surgery; the patient went home stable and alert. We called the following day to check on the patient’s status and you stated everything was well. Nonetheless, the risks were explained to your before and after surgery and the importance of the next 72 hours and care of the pet. Again, we are sorry that the patient passed away but we did our best and explained the risks of surgery, especially that of an emergency surgery.'}</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b546b53b7b21:0x5759b6727efad7e0</Gmap_id></record>

Best experience here in Economico animal Hospital! I got my rabbits spayed and Dr. Yoon took the greatest care for them. The staff are very kind and ensure the best care for your pet.I would highly recommend this hospital! The staff always ensure your pets are improving in any way,shape or form,by far the best service. Grateful for what Economico Animal Hospital had provided for my little ones. Not to forget the environment is very clean and well take care of. Definitely a hospital your pet would feel comfortable to be at rather than being scared to go to the vet👍< /Review>

I brought my puppy Pomeranian just for a vaccine. The employee who helped me was leslie who was very reliable and knowledgeable. Took good care of my puppy and I was even given complimentary services by Dr Yoon. He even notice anal glands with my puppy and treated it without any charge as well as cutting his hair around his area and cutting his nails, again free of charge. Showing Dr Yoons compassion and care for animals. Especially during this pandemic it’s hard to find a great vet and staff. Their curb side services were quick and efficient . I highly recommend this vet and would like to remind visitors and Future visitors that being an essential worker is already stressful and adding extra stress to the staff would not be helpful to the staff and most importantly to our animals :)< /text>

{'time': 1591863697910, 'text': 'Dental cleaning prices certainly vary depending on where you go and what recommendations and treatments they provide for their patients. We hope that you find a veterinarian that better fits what you are looking for. Recommendations are recommendations take it as it is. Nobody forces anyone to do anything. First, we quote for extractions based on the physical examination of the pet. This doesn’t always mean that you’re going to pay that price, simply because we had not yet performed the dental cleaning and are unsure of what it hidden underneath the dental calculus. Dental extractions are not charged per tooth this is done so we can give clients a break. Most places will charge you per tooth and won’t give you that quote over the phone. We cannot point exactly what tooth needs to come out at that moment; we simply informed you that a major number of teeth need to come out.  The exact amount is given to you with a call during the dental cleaning. In regards, to an e-collar we put a collar on to prevent the pet from pawing at their mouth and pulling out the sutures. In regards to the anesthesia monitoring, pre-anesthesia, and induction are not charged separate this is included with the dental cleaning and must be done during any anesthesia procedure to ensure a safe and proper sedation. (Please ensure that your veterinarian performs all these things.) For injections; pain, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory injections should be given, so your pet does not feel any pain and reduce the chances of an infection developing, as the pet will have teeth removed. We also send home pain, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications to continue treatment at home. Again, these are all recommendations, you do have the choice to decline these services. As far as vaccines go, we’ve had positive cases recently relating to the coronavirus (not to be confused with COVID-19); and we recommend to vaccinated the pet against the intestinal disease. Nonetheless, we hope that you find what you are looking for. Thank you for giving us a chance.'}<//response>

<Review>While I'm sure it is not the most expensive for teeth cleaning/extractions out there, it is still expensive for an average animal hospital. I got quoted/ they were going to charge me a little over $1,000 to get my dog's  teeth cleaned and to do "major" extractions. They claimed extractions were necessary, but I would like to point out that they didn't specify what teeth needed to come out or how they came to that conclusion. In addition, I needed to update my dogs vaccines, so that was also included in the quote. I get it, performing extractions is more involved which should be more expensive. But listen, if you're going to charge for additional treatment (laser therapy), and then a bunch of other stuff (e.g. Elizabeth collar, anesthesia monitoring, anesthesia, pre anesthesia sedation, anesthesia induction, clindamycin injection, ketoprofen injection, oral spray, different kinds of antibiotics) without offering alternatives, options, or even explanations I will start to question how reasonable those charges are. I am not a vet so I don't know how necessary each thing was, but an Ecollar/Elizabet collar?

I declined the dental stuff, but because I had already invested the time there I decided to just get my dog's vaccines updated. This included a 6 month bordetella, a 3 year rabies vaccination, a corona vaccination, and a canine DHPP. Other than the rabbies vaccine, all were $22.00. The rabbies was $15.00. They charged a $5.00 biohazard waste fee. They did give me a $20.00 discount. My total was $66.00. Also, I did not ask for, nor was I asked if I wanted my dog to receive a corona vaccine which from my understanding is not usually recommended. Bordetella, and rabies were the only ones I mentioned to the vet, but they proceeded with the other two without telling me. Some may know that a rabbies shot can be given for as low as $10.00. A bordetella is usually around $20.00. I'm not sure about the other two.

Again, while not the most expensive vet there is, I don't think it is very "economical", and I question their treatment recommendations. Later in the day, I called other vets and got quoted for half the price for my dog's dental work.

The staff and vet were friendly enough which is why I gave them an extra star.

I hope this helps narrow someone's search for a good vetinarian.</Review><Rate>2</Rate>< user_id>

<text>Think twice for what you pay here.
These people at this place always try to charge the most they can when your pet is there .
They try to give you and put things that your pet doesn't need..
Scams.</text>< date>

< review>
I just want to start off by saying thanks to Dr. Yoon for helping out my pup Gordo he basically saved his life! 🧡I’m beyond grateful for finding this place. The lovely staff is friendly, sweet, and informative as soon as I walked in I felt welcomed and they asked how my pup was doing! I definitely recommend this place very affordable and understanding with their prices. Im going to spread the word to my friends and loved ones to come here with their furry friends.🐾 I’ll for sure be back with my other dogs for checkups or shots. 😊<//review>

<rating>5</rating><text>A few weeks ago I woke up to blood all over, my cat, Phoenix, had severe facial trauma and so I rushed him to VCA 24 hour hospital first. After they quoted me almost $7000 (for X-RAY, CT scan, surgery, etc) I decided to go elsewhere because I couldn't afford that. Economico accepted walk ins so we decided to go get a second opinion. Dr. Yoon was so kind and compassionate (I was a hot mess). They took x-rays and discussed what needed to be done  The total price was under $2000; a fraction of what VCA wanted to charge!!! When we picked up Phoenix later that evening, Dr. Yoon explained everything to us about the procedure and after care instructions. 2 days post surgery Phoenix still wasn't eating or drinking so we took him back. They cleaned up his wounds gave us some high calorie food and additional pain meds and showed us how to get him to eat. Although we paid for the medication and food, the re-check was free! You can tell Dr. Yoon really cares about his patients! It's nice to know there are affordable places to go that provide quality care! Phoenix is feeling much better now and after going for a recheck today we made an appointment for one of our dogs to get his teeth cleaned this weekend! I am really SO glad we found Economico and Dr. Yoon!</text>< pictures>

We went there in the eve Wed 2/20/19. Dr Yoon was great.  Receptionist was very nice polite professional.  Place was very very clean and smelled nice.  Very easy to get to and find. BUT.... The skin fungal & bacterial culture test cost way more than I anticipated ($200). Had to go back because they forgot to microchip my puppy when I already paid for it.  Also, it's been 3 days and i dont have the rabies certificate yet....  Maybe because the business is new?? Anyway...That's why I have 3/5 stars.<//text>

I learned of Dr. Yoon and Economico Animal Hospital on Nextdoor. My vet’s office just closed and left town so I decided to give them a try. I'm so happy I did. Dr Yoon is knowledgable, friendly and explained the procedure my kitty needed, the office staff was extremely professional and friendly. The office is very clean. I had a short wait even though they don’t take appointments. My entire experience was positive and I recommend their office to everyone with a furry best friend🐶🐱</Review>

<Review>Brought my English bulldog in because he had multiple health issues, but my main concern was his skin. He was loosing patches of hair and his perfect little cinnabon tail had become smelly, slimy and painful to clean. He's a very fearful dog unfortunately so examining him is difficult. They decided to sedate him, shave him and take skin samples among some other procedures. The bill was expensive (around $1900 when everything was said and done) and they prescribed medication and had us come back for a check up a week later. The next day my dog was shaking his head constantly so I had to take him back. They said he had an ear infection (which they never noticed or mentioned when they had him sedated, and supposedly cleaned his ears) and prescribed more medicine. We went back for our next check up,that went fine, and we were told to come back two weeks later. By that time his slimy butt issues had returned and I mentioned it to the staff and they told me to use Optixcare eye wipes to keep it clean. We did as we were told and returned another 2 weeks later for what they decided was his final check up. Although the butt issues were still not resolved, they gave him a "clean bill of health" and said he was fine and the butt issues were just fecal residue and to keep it clean. Fast forward about 4 more weeks. All of the skin conditions have returned and his butt is so inflamed that he's in constant pain and it's raw and bleeding.  We bring our boy back hoping they vet will continue treatment on the dog and have some answers as to the cause of the problem but what we got in return was him literally telling us our dog is going to die from the complications of his tail and that amputation is our only hope. He continued to say he would not perform the surgery because he wasn't comfortable with doing such an invasive job. At that point I was upset and asked him why he had never mentioned that this was a possibility and why did he take nearly 2k from us without ever mentioning that this was an issue or a probability of happening. He basically told us that it's because of his breed and it's something that's been an issue for him his entire life (mind you he's only known the dog for 2 months and my did has never shown signs of this his entire life) The vet, Dr Yoon, basically just got defensive and blamed the dog for his condition. After getting upset he basically said there is nothing he can do, he denied that he never mentioned the severity of the tail condition and after asking him if there was anyone else who could help us he finally in passing said a veterinary dermatologist might be able to help. Dr Yoon is the only vet at this hospital and I believe he is over worked and incompetent. On multiple occasions he would talk to me about conditions on other animals that he confused with my dog and I will not be returning to this facility. He has no compassion for the animals or the people who own them. On one occasion he intentionally startled my dog by poking him in the butt when he wasn't expecting it and intentionally caused him to scream in pain and fear while we were waiting to be seen in the waiting room. Beware of bringing in a bully breed to this place. I will be letting everyone I know not to come here< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate><name>Erin Bernath< /name>< Pictures>

<Review>I am so happy that we finally have new animal hospital that I can trust in my area and is low priced.  I brought my dog here for some dental issues and Dr. Yoon identified the issue quickly and cheap.  In and out quick and found this place was the least expensive of all the ones I checked with.
I finally found my veterinarian for life.  Thank you Econimco !!!!<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2b546b53b7b21:0x5759b6727efad7e0<//GmapID>< name>

<text>Dr. Yoon is amazing! I took my dog to Economico animal hospital for vaccinations. Dr. Yoon checked my dog very thoroughly before giving him the shots and made recommendations what my dog would need in a few months. It seemed like they were busy, but Dr. Yoon took his time to explain as much as possible. Also, this hospital is the cleanest animal hospital I've ever been to and they are very reasonably priced. I feel like I'm not being nickel-and-dimed for every little thing at this hospital. Best of all is that they have amazing, friendly and professional staffs. I'll definitely be going back. Will recommend to everyone!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<text>I brought my yorkie in for an exam. First visit went great and I was left with a great first impression of the place, Dr. Yoon and staff were just amazing. The facility is VERY VERY VERY nice and CLEAN. Dr. Yoon was so good on explaining everything step by step. Their prices are so resonable and affordable. Dr Yoon gave me estaments for vaccinations, chip, neuter, and dental work. Dr. Yoon highly recommended to do dental work on my Yorkie as soon as possible to avoid any future problems. On this point forward this will be my to go Vet. I highly recommend this place.< /text><resp>{'time': 1564096161599, 'text': 'Thank you!!!'}< /resp>< Pics>

I want to thank Dr.Yoon and his amazing staff for taking the time to explain to me what was wrong with my dog Hercules and explaining to me the health hazards my dog could have in the long run if not treated, My dog is a 2 year old english bulldog that needed a ectropion surgery his skin was so saggy that it was causing his eyelashes to prevent him from seeing and scratching his cornea dr.yoon did the surgery the same day and my doggo was able to go home later that day. We are now able to see his eyes and he is more playful than ever now that he can see better.

I highly recommend this animal hospital very affordable, clean and professional thank you DR.YOON!!!!!!!< /text>

<Review>Most of my reviews are always positive and I try to find the best thing about where I have eaten and or shopped. Although this time my review has positive and negative opinions. Me and my mom took her 16yr old cat to this new vet that we got a flyer for in the mail. My parents are on a fixed income and I on SSD so needless to say money is tight. With that said my mom spoils all 8 of her animals. She spends about 300 to 400 on food and supplies monthly and is a responsible pet parent . We went to Ecinòmico because the flyer said free exam for new clients. We would have gone to the Vet my parents normally went to for the last 40 years but he retired. My moms cat had a rub sore on her hind paw. We arrived at Ecinomico and saw it was a VERY clean and nice new facility. The young woman at the counter was very nice and we filled out paper work and were put in the exam room. Now this is when it took a turn.  the Vet who is the main vet came in hardly looked at my moms cat and seemed to be in a rush he said its infected and couldn't do much till he got her in back. At this point my mom wanted to ask him a few questions about another cat of hers he's a older cat and is my moms little boy and has become incontinent and has hip problems. The Vet had this air about him that he was in a rush and asking these questions just weren't worth his time. He told my mom "I am repeating myself" Now if I or my mom are asking a questioner more then once maybe we didn't understand but how dare you speak to a new client . Then the biller came in and my mom had said to the doctor we didn't have much money ( our budget was $150.00) she told him. Well the biller came in with an estimated total of 178.00 and my mom said that was to much we only had 150. She gave us a look like "ugh why are you here if you can't pay" she went out came back with more attitude and said the doctor adjusted it. We signed and paid. NOW on the flip side when in the lobby when they brought out the cat I tried explaining to the same woman about how these animals are my moms babies and when you talk to a pet parent in a certain way its taken in a way that your in a way calling us a bad pet parent and I did start to cry. She walked off and the main vet came back out and explained what was wrong with our cat and said thanks and good bye. Be back for a bandage change in 3 days. We took her back the biller was working the front desk and when she helped my mom she had the same attitude from before. They took the cat in the back brought her our said come back in 4 days didn't say how it was doing handed my mom the cat and walked away. Now I am no one special but at the previous vet we went to this would never have happened . I hope this place changes the way they handle their customers because after all with out a customer you don't have a business.<//Review>< pics>

He stated that the patient was not eating, lethargic, vomiting, very low energy. We diagnose your pet with pyometra. We inform you based on the current condition of the patient, the age of the patient, the diagnosis found, and the risk of undergoing surgery. Pyometra without a surgical approach has extremely low successful resolution. Without proper immediate treatment, the toxic effects of the bacteria will be fatal in most cases. The doctor went over all the risks of the surgery, before and after the surgery. We explain the possibility that the patient died during or after surgery. Any surgical approach always carries risks, be they human or animal. While we do everything in our power to ensure that any anesthetic procedure runs smoothly, we cannot guarantee that the patient will survive. This is beyond the hands of humans. We are sorry that your pet passed away. We complete the surgery; the patient went home stable and alert. We called the next day to check on the patient's condition and you said everything was fine. However, the risks before and after surgery and the importance of the next 72 hours and caring for the pet were explained to him. Again, we are sorry that the patient passed away, but we did our best and explained the risks of the surgery, especially that of an emergency surgery.\n\n(Original)\nSu mascota llegó al hospital después de 3 meses de tener una infección en el útero.

La pyometra sin un abordaje quirúrgico tiene una resolución exitosa extremadamente baja. Sin un tratamiento inmediato adecuado, los efectos tóxicos de las bacterias serán fatales en la mayoría de los casos. El médico repasó todos los riesgos de la cirugía, antes y después de la cirugía. Explicamos la posibilidad de que el paciente falleciera durante o después de la cirugía. Cualquier abordaje quirúrgico siempre conlleva riesgos, ya sean humanos o animales. Si bien hacemos todo lo que está a nuestro alcance para garantizar que cualquier procedimiento anestésico se desarrolle sin problemas, no podemos garantizar que el paciente sobrevivirá. Esto está más allá de las manos de los humanos. Lamentamos que su mascota falleciera. Completamos la cirugía; el paciente se fue a casa estable y alerta. Llamamos al día siguiente para verificar el estado del paciente y usted dijo que todo estaba bien. No obstante, se le explicaron los riesgos antes y después de la cirugía y la importancia de las próximas 72 horas y el cuidado de la mascota. Nuevamente, lamentamos que el paciente falleciera, pero hicimos todo lo posible y explicamos los riesgos de la cirugía, especialmente el de una cirugía de emergencia."}<//resp><name>Flor Santamaria< /name>< Gmap_id>

El letrero de económico?? Para mí es lo contrario es muy caro 🤷‍♀️y más por la pandemia que esta ahorita y no es justo que cobren tan caro<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1595987849918, 'text': "(Translated by Google) To begin with the situation that brought your pet was very serious. You gave her the pet medication that was purchased from a location not recommended by a licensed veterinarian. This caused the pet to develop seizures and tremors. This is an emergency situation and we started emergency services to start stabilizing the patient. We let you know how much it was and you agreed. You said you didn't understand when we informed you of the prices, so we were willing to help you by doing everything at a single price, but you said you couldn't afford this. We understand that there is a pandemic, so we are ready to help you. We gave him medications free of charge since he said he did not have all the funds. We did what we could within our reach. We also inform you of a place where you can take your pet so that they can help you. We are a small company, which means that we are also affected by the pandemic. If we do not charge for the services provided, this could mean the closure of the business. This will leave staff out of work and there would be no hospital for pets to receive the treatments they need. We hope you find a hospital where the pet can continue to receive the necessary treatments.\n\n(Original)\nPara comenzar con la situación que trajeron a su mascota fue muy grave. Le diste el medicamento para mascotas que se compró en un lugar no recomendado por un veterinario con licencia. Esto causó que la mascota desarrollara convulsiones y temblores. Esta es una situación de emergencia y comenzamos los servicios de emergencia para comenzar a estabilizar al paciente. Le informamos cuánto fue y usted estuvo de acuerdo. Dijiste que no entendías cuando te informamos sobre los precios, así que estábamos dispuestos a ayudarte haciendo todo a un precio único, pero dijiste que no podías pagar esto. Entendemos que hay una pandemia, por eso estamos dispuestos a ayudarlo. Le dimos medicamentos sin cargo ya que dijo que no tenía todos los fondos. Hicimos lo que pudimos a nuestro alcance. También le informamos de un lugar donde puede llevar a su mascota para que puedan ayudarlo. Somos una pequeña empresa, lo que significa que también nos afecta la pandemia. Si no cobramos por los servicios prestados, esto podría significar el cierre del negocio. Esto dejará al personal sin trabajo y no habría hospital para que las mascotas reciban los tratamientos que necesitan. Esperamos que encuentre un hospital donde la mascota pueda continuar recibiendo los tratamientos necesarios."}<//response><GmapID>0x80c2b546b53b7b21:0x5759b6727efad7e0<//GmapID></record>

We understand that you and your family are going through a difficult time.  ACCESS is a 24 hour hospital. Whereas, we are operational during our posted business hours.  We provided assistance to you with only a limited amount of time. Our staff stayed behind their scheduled time to provided assistance and care to your pet.\nIn regards, to “only matters money.”  Our primary goal is to provide the best medical care and to our patients. With this being said, we are a business and in order to continue providing care to our clients/patients we do need to charge for services rendered. Because the doctor wanted to begin ruling out a prognosis we recommend diagnostics. You expressed to us that you did not have the funds to move forward with the diagnostics. However, because of the severity of the patient we offered to assist you by providing then at a lesser rate. Our staff also offered to help you with your technical issues. Our staff stayed past business hours waiting for you to return to move forward with the procedure. When you did not return, we closed and ended the day. We found out later from our friends at ACCESS on the patient’s status.\nOur staff helped and assisted you and your pet and offered services beyond what is expected. It truly hurt the staff to hear that you felt they did not care for your pet when their actions showed the care and compassion they provided. We are glad to hear you found a hospital that give you what you were looking for.\nBest Regards,\nSofia'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This place is fantastic. Eureka is a town that straight up pays little attention to customer service.  Christie & Jennifer are the Exception to that.  Every time I go in, they go out of their way to ensure I'm taken care of.  If you're looking to get a loan or just cash a check, as long as you have your paperwork in order, this is the Only place you should go in town.  Many times I've watched them handle difficult customers ahead of me, and they really do take the time to explain their policies in a clear way.  I used to use services like this in the LA area, and none of them are as patient and goodwilled as Check N Go Eureka.  Thumbs up.</Review>< user_name>

Never experienced her forcing a card down my throat or misrepresenting ChecknGo. Keep doing your thing Tui. Checkngo is lucky to have a dedicated employee like yourself. You represent the company well. About time they found you some help. Cause everytime I've visited store you're the only one working. Positive vibes and welcoming attitudes keep me coming back.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
It was a quick and painless process to get a storage unit for myself the day that I needed to move everything into it. Super accommodating and friendly staff and I like that you can pay the rent online. Also the hours that you can get to your unit are a lot better than some other storage unit providers I’ve had in the past. Definitely a big reason why I chose them also.< /Review>

<Review>Dean, at the Huntington Beach; Gothard location, was awesome. Set up our unit for us quickly, got us logged in and to our unit in no time. Dean is very friendly, and a happy guy, he answered questions for us and gave us the run down of how the storage facility works. Thanks Dean for all your help! Definitely recommend if you need a short term or long term rental, the property features several types of units,  secure entry, and 24/7 video surveillance.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This is actually the second review I've given since I've been here at A-1 Self Storage. I can't say enough about Dean the site manager. Dean always goes out of his way to make sure he explains everything and speaks to everyone in a very genuine, calm and considerate manner. And all the while being a professional, authoritative and exemplary employee. The property here is absolutely the cleanest facility I have ever seen. Everywhere you go in this entire place smells wonderful. The way the property and security system is set up, coupled with the eagle eye of the property manager... Feeling safe and secure for myself and my belongings is never a question at A-1 Self Storage. I would highly recommend this location specifically, to everyone  and anyone. I would like to add that anyone giving a review of less than five stars desperately needs their head checked.<//review>

<review>The storage facility is clean, well lit and in a very convenient location. I was looking for a storage facility that could accommodate an 18 wheeler truck and this is the one.
Dean the manager made the signing up simple and easy.<//review>< pictures>

I stopped in to get a small storage unit. I walked into the office and was greeted by Dean. Very friendly and thorough. He toured the grounds and quoted the price accurately. Got a great deal. The grounds were very clean, safe and easy to navigate. Would absolutely recommend.</Review>

<Text>A-1 Self Storage on Gothard is a 5 star ⭐️ storage facility! The on-site management team is second to none. The facility is always clean, well lit and safe.
I really felt secure with each unit having an alarm for added security. It’s the best storage facility in H.B. hands down!</Text><gmapID>0x80dd268c6c464697:0x4f1a6f6099efa8e9<//gmapID>< resp>

<Review>I have never been a happier or more satisfied customer then I am renting with  A1 Storage in Huntington Beach. Dean, the Store Manager is amazing. He is so wonderful at performing a variety of duties. Without fail I can rely on immaculate facilities and everything in working order. Dean is often always seen around the grounds working on a large variety of projects that make renting there a more pleasant experience. He is professional, friendly and dedicated to serving his customers. He is devoted to making the facilities the best that they can be for all of his customers. Thank you Dean, for being so great at your job!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The site manager, Dean, provided outstanding, thoughtful, and timely service throughout my 45 months of storage at the Gothard Street location.  From paperwork, to account set up, to billing, to close out, everything was handled promptly and professionally.  I would give my highest personal recommendation to Dean and A-1 Storage in Huntington Beach.</Text>

I wanted to take some time out to write a review for A-1 Self Storage in Huntington Beach, and to acknowledge the great service that it provides to it's customers.  First of all, I am a returning customer with the last 10 years.  I recently sold my house and needed a storage unit.  I drove to A-1 on a Sunday and was able to rent a unit via the kiosk.  I had remote assistance from the San Diego office where the customer service rep helped me through the process.  The very next day, Dean called me to see how my experience was.  I replied "AMAZING!"  I remembered Dean from the first time that I rented space and he was just as kind and courteous from my first experience.  I truly believe that A-1 Huntington Beach is clean, secure and the rules and guidelines are straight forward.  I feel like I can get to things whenever I need them.  These types of things shouldn't go unnoticed; from my opinion, its clear that customer service is Dean and A-1 Self-storage's number one priority.  Thank you so much for protecting my valuables! 5-STAR *****<//review>

<Text>I can not say enough about this facility and especially the property manager, Dean. I moved to the area not long ago and needed a storage unit for my job. Not only did Dean help me find an affordable option with everything that I needed (climate control and reliable security) but he has been there for me every step of the way since. He goes above and beyond to help me and always treats us as tenants with kindness and genuine care. He is one of the best people I know and makes storing at A-1 a very satisfying experience. I hardly ever write reviews, but I feel very strongly about recommending this option to anyone searching for a storage unit!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1462216332000, 'text': "Thank you so much for sharing your experience, Austin!

I don't think Dean could have made this process any more easy. I had signed up, and paid, online so I just needed to go sign my agreement and buy a lock. Dean walked me through the coding process, walked me to my unit, and even swept it out. I would highly recommend A-1 Storage for any of your storage needs!!< /text>

Dean, the manager, goes above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable and help you. The storage is really clean and has great security. All my storage needs will always be with A-1 Self Storage after the great experience we've had!< /text>

Super clean, well kept facility. The reason I chose this storage after checking out others in the area is because of Dean. With over a decade of working there, he makes the transaction very smooth. He is informative, knowledgable, accommodating and pleasant. Thank you so much!</Text>

After calling and visiting several facilities, I came upon A-1, and found a pleasant difference. Manager Dean was extremely professional, informative and flexible to my needs & the type of storage I needed. The location is very accomodating, well maintained/clean and has all the proper technical security to keep me feeling safe about my stuff being safe.

I would recommend this A-1 to anyone looking for the peace of mind of safely securing their belongings.</text>

I'm only writing this review because the storage unit manger, Dean, is that good. Dean loves his tenents and it's obvious to see. Dean will go out of his way to make sure you have everything you need and then some. We had a piece of furniture break on us and we needed to throw it away. Dean helped us break it down and dispose of it properly! Such a nice guy! Thanks Dean!!!</text>

<text>I don't know about office managers at other A-1 Storage facilities, but at this location in HB, Office Manager Dean, truly cares for his customers and their experience. The facility is always clean and everything functions perfectly from gates opening , lights working, to carts rolling smoothly, which meets or satisfies my expectations. However, Dean goes beyond that and finds ways to create customer loyalty. I don't visit to often but he always seems to know who I am and treats me as a person and not just another monthly rental. I've unknowingly tripped the alarm in my unit and he professionally and respectfully informed me of the procedure. He has also gone the extra mile to help me resolve billing issues and Ive seen him passionately handle special request from other long time tenants. The way Dean takes care of his clients is what has kept me here for many years.<//text>< pics>

I also shopped around for a good deal and I have to say this was the best one and the facility is great, fully secured and well maintained, on-site restroom and the office area is comfy and nicely air conditioned, with coffee and cold water :)< /text>< pics>

I didn't want to move our belongings into storage. But, since I had to I'm glad I found A-1 Storage. The place is clean:) Dean is diligent at his work and made it a pleasure to store with A-1.</review>

Service here is friendly, KNOWLEDGABLE and POLITE!
The price was.....ok, but insurance? Not really wanted.
The unit is clean, quiet, and SMELLS GOOD (Like a "smell-good pluber" harp music please)
Thanks for the good business experience Dean!!!  :)</Text>

I see all the 5 star reviews and am sad I didn't get the same treatment. Such a strange experience, too. He lost my business today.</Text>

I was in a tough position but Dean the Manager from A-1 Storage helped me out tremendously. I did not like the fact that it was mandatory to buy a lock, when I had 3 perfectly capable ones.<//review>

Our first visit was on April and were hoping to be a cold day as the zoo is by the beach. However, the weather favored us and we had a great time. Our 2 year old niece loved every section of the zoo specially the penguins. Agree with everyone here- it is bigger and better than Oakland zoo. Also you can park on the streets but be careful while crossing the busy street.<//text>

I had the best wedding here thank you to Kelli who made the booking extremely easy and catered to my every need! This is the spot for your next party. My wedding was perfect and I had my wedding and reception here! Everything was so perfect and beautiful five minutes drive max to the beach for photos and close to good hotels! I’m definitely going to rent the venue again for future parties</Review>

< Review>
I have to give 4 stars just for the animals. Although when I pass some animals I feel truly sad as they do not look happy at all (such as the polar bear, it is just too hot).

But all in all it is beautiful zoo near the ocean.

I am just deducting a star because even with the membership they charge you for parking which is 10$ and everything in the zoo is just way overpriced (drinks and food). I know it is a zoo but in comparison to Oakland zoo it is very expensive.

I love that there are many volunteers stationed in most of the points and giving your fun facts and information about the animals. Really bless their heart!</Review>

My Brother catered for Mr and Mrs. Ramirez the pork was amazing and he made his own home made bbq dressings and salad dressings as well. I liked the Champagne dressing he had. He had Ranch and Strawberries dressing.</Text>

<Date>1576443645285<//Date><Name>Charles Salyer</Name><review>This a great venue for a party, wedding or other event.  Large inside area with a bar, stage and MC/DJ station.   Multicolored lighting.  Sound system.  Beautiful huge surrounding patio area.  Two doors that allow easy access to the inside area for great flow.  Tables and chairs to handle sit down dining or cocktails. Onsite and offsite parking. Kelly is a dream to work with arranging catering, dj, bands and oversight.

Easy to find near downtown Ventura.  Check it out.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

The rooms are extremely clean and the place is extremely quiet. The staff is excellant. The restaurant on premises is fantastic! We stay in the "Family unit", it has a king and a separate bedroom with bunk beds and T.V. for kids! Its $99 a night and you cant beat that, fridge and microwave too.</review>

I was so disappointed in the peanut butter ice cream which had ice chunks, more of a sorbet texture, and a bland flavor (I had a hard time figuring out which was peanut butter and which was vanilla). Vanilla was very okay-ish (also icy) at best and chocolate was fine, with a smoother and denser texture than the three. Eveb though I'm lactose intolerant and appreciate the effort, I still wouldn't eat here again.
Update:
Adding that I'm even more disappointed to find out that all the ice cream flavors were less than satisfying, and two of them were made from cream and milk-- I don't think there's a good excuse for messing up ice cream made from heavy cream< /Text>

Plenty of flavors. I can’t even describe how perfect and creamy the ice cream is here. Not to mention the presentation of this joint is flawless. Black owned as well. Just love local diverse businesses. Better then the other two local dessert spots (both excellent tho) but this place has ice cream made with THE MOST LOVE</text>

<Review>Ice cream is delish, not sure why they only had one girl working there by herself. She was working though a busy evening and held it down pretty good. She also had a great attitude despite of it all. The place is small so when 3 or 4 people line up and most tables are taken it becomes crowded so it would have been nice to get more help to move people along. Also they need more flavors!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1529994264168, 'text': 'hi chelly - thanks for your review. mondays are usually not too busy so we try to get by with one server - hope you didn\'t have to wait too long!  we start each day with 12-14 different flavors, but since our ice cream is freshly made once a day, we cannot "refill" when we to sell out of certain flavors. that\'s the paradis concept - fresh every day from fresh natural ingredients. it differs from more "industrial" ice cream that is produced to last several months, with various additives and stabilizers. i apologize for the inconvenience, and hope you will stop by again to try other flavors!'}< /response><GmapID>0x80c2b378ebba6a83:0xcfb3389f18ab44e7< /GmapID></record>

Omg, ice cream macaroon sandwiches?! I'm sold. My favorite is the red velvet one

This is a great place for desserts. Lots of ice cream (including the ice cream macaroon sandwich mentioned above), cupcakes, cakes, etc.

Service is good. Lines can get a little long if you go at a busy time. Parking is street parking where you can find in the area.

You also might run into some celebs here, which I did! I ran into two people from Desperate Housewives, which used to be one of my fave shows. It was seriously so cool!<//text>

Awesome place to grab some tasty ice cream that's just steps away from the beach. Pretty small inside, with only a few places to sit, but there is outside seating as well. They have old-school board games you can use for free (Uno, Connect Four), which is awesome. The staff are very patient and offer up tastes without batting an eye.<//review>

< Text>
hated this place. First of all before going i called them 3 times and nobody picked up. very bad impression on their first opening day. then i reached the store and asked for 2 scoops of ice-cream. serving was very small barely even a scoop. The cup was really small. Other places i have ice-cream their double scoop is enough for three people to eat but this was barely a scoop and the ice-cream was melted. Felt like i was having milkshake from a spoon. Oh and the guy didn't even know how to use the credit card machine. disappointed as their first day did not impress me and i wouldn't go back to this place ever.</Text>

<Review>This is the best ice cream around. Soft, creamy, and super flaverful and good serving sizes and the best service around. Worth the trip to Hermosa Beach from anywhere around just for the ice cream. I never go to LA without a trip to Paradise!</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b378ebba6a83:0xcfb3389f18ab44e7<//gmap_id>< Pics>

Paradis is a perfect example of the old, beach city Hermosa vibe where unique and original characters throve. The shop is a classic ice cream shop. Simple selections of cones and a respectable range of flavors. It''s a cool change from the mix-ins and boutique shops that have been popular in the past few years. It's good, old-fashioned ice cream and gelato. Every time I go they have something new.

Some of the non-custard flavors come off a little light, but are super refreshing on a hot day. The creamy custards just can't be beat though.< /Text><username>Sergey Evangelista< /username><Time>1527611744211<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The quality of ice cream was excellent. The Oreo was to die for. Portions sizes are good.

Best ice cream on the strip.

Went there the other night, and the girl who worked there was giving as much ice cream as could fit into the cups for the customers ahead of us...then when it was our turn, she barely gave us just a couple scoops...

Also, there was this weird old woman who kept trying to cut us in line and trying to rush us during our order, and the girl working behind the counter did nothing to keep the other customer in check.<//Review>

3 reviews outta 5

Ordered menudo to go and it was actually good! Ordered Chilakiles and were good No complaints....

But when it was time to get my food after waiting 20 for it ($50 Worth of menudo) the owner only gave me a small bag of onion cilantro and half a lemon! (STINGY)

and the worst part about it she asked me if I wanted to buy tortillas like wow ot should be included not sold!< /text>

< Review>
Had Menudo here on Wednesday. It was delicious!  With homemade corn tortillas!  My grandson had 2 tacos and a burrito. He loved them. It was Taco Wednesday so they were 99 cents can’t beat that so I took a dozen mixed for dinner. People here are really nice. I was very impressed with their kindness toward an elderly gentleman who was having problems walking. The young lady came outside, moved a table to the sun and had him sit down. Now that’s impressive so I will definitely be coming back!<//Review>

The food is alright the prices for the food are ridiculously high for what was given. When I saw the prices were high I though maybe the amount is good at least but... was I wrong. The plates were foam which shows a lack of respect towards customers. It is a restaurant not a street stand.<//Review>

2 years in MoVal and this is the first place that I've found that the food is delicious and actually makes me want to crave it.
The sopes are delicious, personally I get chorizo and asada and sometimes mix it
Their menudo is so good that I've ran into family from Orange County here before.
It's a well known hole in the wall type of place.< /text>

<Review>I was taken back by the how much a burrito is at this place, they charged me over $9 for a burrito that I asked to add rice! But I wasn't having some of the other ingredients that it comes with!! I have never paid that much for a burrito before. On top of that what Mexican place doesn't carry avocado?? I highly recommend La Traspasada on California, Elston and Belmont. Super friendly and super clean. Their food authentic and more reasonable than Zacatecas place. Businesses that are cash only, I wonder if they are paying their taxes???</Review>< gmap_id>

****** EXTREME RUDENESS *******  The food is OK however the service is horrible. What makes it even worse, is you can’t even complain to the manager because it’s owner operated and 99% of the time, the rude one are the owners themselves.< /text>

They claim it’s broken but when you complain then they turn it on. They refuse to give you an extra plate when you ask for one.

Great menudo and home made tortillas.  Though the place is small, the food is worth the wait for a table.<//Text>

Food was ok, nothing to make a dedicated trip to this out of the way so called restaurant. We had the carne asada and chicken tacos. The meat was a little tough and too chewy, nervy. We got there around 7:30 pm and the one employee / cashier was already sweeping up and putting chairs on top of vacant tables preparing to close.  Yes, I said close.  They close at 8:00 pm during the week?! With so many food options in Moreno Valley they need to be open to accommodate customers.  As it was,  we were rushed to finish eating.  We were very disappointed, we will not spend our money there again. We are not gong back there.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The food is good but the prices are very high for the portions so small that they serve, but what is really terrible is the cervisio that they offer, and those in charge all the time are in a bad mood and treat you as if they were giving you the food, For example, if you forgot to ask for something or simply and simply the tortillas or the drink did not reach you, you have to make another line to buy them because they think you are going to run without paying a simple tirtilla order that costs you $ 1 dollar. By the time you return from buying your food, it is already completely cold. The Cervisio is truly pathetic, orrible, it shows that they do not know how to bring the Jamaican clientele back !!!!

(Original)
La comida esta buena pero los precion son muy altos para las porciones tan pequeñas que sirven, pero lo que verdaderamente es terrible el cervisio que ofrecen, y los encargados todo el tiempo estan de mal humor y te tratan como si te estubieran regalando la comida, por ejemplo si se te olvido pedir algo o simple y sencillamente no te alcansaron las tortillas o la bebida tienes que hacer otra vez linea para comprarlas porque piensan que vaz a salir corriendo sin pagar una simple orden de tirtilla que te cuesta $1 dollar. Ya para cuando regresar de comprarlas tu comida ya esta totalmente fria Verdaderamente el cervisio es patetico, orrible, se nota que no saben como trar la clientela jamaz regresere!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) Delicious authentic Mexican food, it looks like home-made food straight from Mexico and not to mention its handmade tortillas or delicious coffee. All their food is delicious, the only problem is the price $$$, as a family we realized that we spend there the same or more than what we spend in the IHOP or Olive Garden.
I wish the prices went down, so we could go more often.
= Your fifth star would give them if they had a good price =

(Original)
Deliciosa comida de verdad autentica mexicana, parece comida hecha en casa directa desde México y ni se diga de sus tortillitas hechas a mano o su delicioso café.  Toda su comida está riquísima, el único problema es el precio $$$, como familia nos dimos cuenta que gastamos ahí lo mismo o mas de lo que gastamos en el IHOP o Olive Garden.
Ojalá le bajaran los precios, así podriamos ir mas seguido.

<text>I have two nephews (twins) with birthday’s coming up and my brother told me they are on a Van’s kick so off to Van’s I went. I had no idea what was in these days so I leaned on the guidance of Trevor, my awesome shopping guide who pointed me in the right direction. I didn’t buy anything for myself, but decided to try on a pair of shoes to see what the Hype was bout and I must admit, very comfortable!</text>< pics>

Not as big of a skate selection as the Beverly Center branch, but they have a better shoe selection. They have that wall with all the custom shoes, and there's 2 iPads where you can make your own customs. Nice looking store and cool people, so a good store overall.< /review>

(Translated by Google) What about this shop?
An amazing shop that offers a huge selection of products and shoes in particular.
Comfortable for long walks but also aesthetically beautiful.
I advise.

I love this place. It's got the fried zucchini I love.
Sometimes the zucchinis are better than other days, but all-in-all, I think it's a good value and they have a good variety of items on their menu.< /text>

First time here. Ordered my usual burrito: bacon breakfast burrito, add grilled onions and sour cream. Burrito was very good and very big. If I had to offer any constructive criticism, I would say to cook the potatoes a bit longer to get them nice and browned. The salsa is absolutely on point, had to have been one of the best that I've had with a burrito. The employees were friendly and polite. Overall, a very pleasant experience. Left very satisfied and would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a good spot to eat.</text>

Gold Star Hamburgers is one of my favorite fast food places to eat.  They have homemade albondigas soup that is amazing that is served Thursday through Saturday.  I love their fried zucchini with ranch dressing.  It is cut thin and crispy.  This evening I had a steak sandwich that was very tender and well seasoned. All portions are extremely large.< /Review>

Nice family restaurant in Jurupa Valley. Serves breakfast all day. Very good French toast. Professional and friendly staff. ?Take out or indoor seating. Favorite for locals. Nice American and Mexican food . Went for business lunch, had avocado burger. Would prefer burger patties to have more meet though.<//text>

The burgers are amazing here. I would probably go as far as say they are better than In N Out burgers in my opinion. The fries are huge but still really good. Clean and maintained restaurant overall.<//Text>

<review>This probably one of those places that you go just because is there.  I've tried their sandwich club which is pretty good.  Their breakfast burritos are probably the best food on their menu.  You got to order the chorizo burrito, one of my favorite burritos from this area.  The reason why I give a 4 star is because the drive thru speed is really slow.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I did not care for my hamburger one bit I asked for it to be well done and it was still pink inside I took it back and I asked to be for it to be cooked longer and they refused. I am a hamburger as is and ended up feeling sick because I'm not used to eating hamburgers that are still slightly raw will not be returning<//Text>

This place has a chill atmosphere that you can enjoy with friends. Whether your truly hungry or want to just sit and chat, this place has a good vibe to it. Food is ok and price is typical for a burger joint. Overall I'll be back. I took a date here and we talked for a long time without being disturbed. :)<//Review>

Let me explain a bit more about my food experiences.... so my food experiences must be memorable like giving birth to a child or getting married, only then is it worth me paying for fast food. Also since I can eat for a family of 6 prices need to be extremely reasonable for me to afford it, anywho there you go hope it helps explain having memorable food experiences.</review>

<text>I love these truck stop, greasy spoon, mom n pop places. It's a guilty pleasure. And this place is a personal favorite. The double cheeseburger it's good and the fried zucchini is good when it's fresh out of the fryer. It doesn't do so well to go unless of course you're eating it in your car (ask for extra ranch, the cup they give you isn't enough for the portion they serve). I still have to try their pastrami.<//text>< Pictures>

Pastrami is killer !!   You can’t find a better one any place on earth.  I had to write this review up to show my support, and always pick an extra one up for my dad. My mom and dad split one and call me later raving about them.

If ever in the mood, help contribute to this fantastic place. It’s a gem, and nobody should take them for granted.

Cheers and Happy eating!< /text>

A fairly decent family style restaurant. The kind you used to go to after church when you were a kid (assuming you're old enough to get that reference). It's clean, fairly priced, with a overly robust menu. Things to be on the look out for include the Patty Melt, Family Meal Deal Combo which included 4 burgers, fries, and drinks, and the homemade Albondigas. They give you fries by the boatload too! Customer service is lacking to be honest but the food makes up for it. I'd come back if I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.<//text>

I got an omelette and asked for an extra egg since I wasn't getting toast or hashbrowns.  Was told they could substitute the has brown's to fries and toast to pancake only.  Not the most accommodating to those avoiding carbs.</text><time>1572837558095<//time>< Name>

The drive thru speaker works great, they let me finish my order before asking questions. That way I don't forget anything. Chef salad and fried zucchini are my favorite.<//Review>

<Review>I've been there twice the first time I would have rated at 5 Stars the last time my friend and I had to wait for over 20 minutes just to bring our order to their attentions they took the counter and they said that it was coming up but I think they placed it that time so really it took us about 35 minutes to get our food and that was fast food. :-(<//Review>< Pictures>

Food was good but the staff were not very friendly. When I said hello to the cashier he did not even respond. Then when I said thank you after he took my order he again just pretended that he did not hear me and did not respond.<//review>

<Review>Came in here 2 nights ago (9/5/18) at around 8ishh and they were completely rude and unprofessional. Too bad I didn't get their names but it was as 2 young Hispanic girls. My friends card was not going through and after they degraded him with their comments trying to make it seem like we didn't have money I tried my card which also did not read. We ended up paying cash. My friend noticed that the charge went through! They double dipped , took his cash and his debit. These girls continued to laugh throughout the time we were there it was really uncomfortable. Needless to say we boxed our food and left.</Review>< Pictures>

<date>1534209827748< /date><rate>1</rate><review>So today was my first time trying gold star hamburgers I decided to stop off on the way home from work after a 17-hour day in a hot Warehouse my daughter wanted some pastrami chili cheese fries and and she wanted me to make sure it was finally chopped pastrami because then she chokes she's 10 so I tend to ask for this usually I go down the street from my house but because I was there and they look good I get home in the Pastrami and whole pieces I call back the place and the rude lady who answered the phone the cashier she says that she put it on the receipt and I said yes I see it on the receipt but now you made my job more difficult know I got to pull off this Pastrami and chop it up I said for the first time going there I said I'm not impressed I should have just went down the street from my house she said maybe you should have so maybe you guys should not stop and eat here they don't know how to take orders and apparently the Kooks can't read and when you call back you get a lady on the phone who is rude so just go to the hamburger joint near your house as long as it's not gold star</review>< Pics>

<rate>3<//rate><review>I came here for the first time today. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a double cheeseburger combo. The burger as good but the fries are unsalted and tasteless as for the burrito was packed with meat but the meat was subpar and the rice wasn't good plus the beans weren't that good either. Come here for the burgers only. Also the drive through attendant wasn't very friendly.<//review>< pics>

Great food cannot knock it it is roughly $8 more on average for a burger meal with the burgers are four times better than a typical fast food restaurant the old saying is you get what you paid for it and it is worth spending that extra buck< /text>

<Text>Just tried this place last month and ordered a double cheese and fries with a soda... will go every other week now. It has great taste and the size is just to the tip of getting food coma! They give you alot of fries... Alot! And they are perfectly crispy! If your wanting to get that mom and pop vibe you'll get it here. The ranch is also delish! Can't wait to go again</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>
