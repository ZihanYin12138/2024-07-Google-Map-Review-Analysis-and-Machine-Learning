<review>We got lucky and didn't encounter huge crowds, tho I can image this hike gets a lot of traffic.  It's shaded, lush, gentle at the start with a nice climb down to the waterfall and back- nothing too hard so good for all ages - although some parts of it are narrow with a steep drop. Hubby went swimming in the pool under the waterfall- too cold for me!<//review>< pictures>

I really enjoy this magnificent trail. It was a short moderate hike. On your way to the waterfall it's easy however on your way back you'll encounter a few inclines. Other than that a beautiful trail. The best views of the Angeles Forest mountains</Review>

< review>
When I went, it was a bit busy. I arrived around 7:05am and the gates were closed to the trail entrance parking area, or picnic  area, it just closed for the cars,  so  I had to park at the parking spots by the road and walked down to the tail entrance, which is around the picnic area,

If you see the sign “Switzer Picnic Area”, there is a pathway that takes you down to the trail entrance.
Also you will walk next to the creek no against the  creek, however you will cross the river and you will face (2)trails  I will recommend the top trail, if you're a beginning hiker, is so much easier eventhough have some inclination but you wil be able to do it. , but if you desire to take down trail  becareful you will have to climb a rocks ddownhill.
If You took top trail After 2.5 miles you will have to take downhill you will see a sign that said falls, follow the sign and you will face the waterfall so you will walk against the the creek.
Note : Important  you can go back the way you get in there or you can go back by hiking by the top of the of the waterfall but is so hard you will have to climb a rocks uphill, there is water on the rocks I will no recommend.

The trail is primarily used for hiking and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.

The way down isn’t too bad.  I did 5 miles , Returning was more strenuous than going to the falls.. The waterfall was beautiful and the trail was mostly shady and cool breeze made our hike more enjoyable.

smooth walk it’s just only the way back that there’s inclinationat the end.  River crossing but there big enough rocks to make it through just fine! Enjoy!  PLEASE KEEP IT  CLEAN THIS TRAIL , PLEASE DON'T SIGH YOUR STUPI NAME ON IT ROCKS , NO GRAFFITI PLEASE< /review>

It has something for everyone !
First part of the trail is easy but as you start going up, you go up for a while and then down on a busy and narrow trail till you get to waterfalls.

Many people with 🐕  and seen many without a leash. Is a trail for all ages.
Beautiful place.<//text>

Great hike to the falls. Both lower parking lots are unaccessible so you need to walk down and ultimately back up. 😢 Super views! Dress in layers since you don't get sun in the canyon. The wind chill really gets you. Many clean bathrooms (open). Tons of benches and BBQ grills (closed at moment). Don't forget your Adventure Pass.<//Text>

<UserId.>108918157378791722773</UserId.><Name>Ruchit Gandhi< /Name><text>We went on a Trail to Switzer Falls during February. The experience was very good. The weather was cool during this time of the year and the trek was also good owing to the numerous streams we had to cross to reach the falls. There is a well defined path for the Trail which makes it easier to reach the falls.
To park the car near the starting point, you need to collect a Parking permit which is available at a Shell gas station before the upway road starts.</text></record>

I love the trail that is 75% covered in shade by the surrounding trees and the sound of the rivers that are close by throughout the hike is so calming.   This trail is fun to bring kids along and also I have seen dogs along the trail enjoying splashing water to cool off while hiking.  There are bathrooms next to the parking located at the bottom next to the starting point.<//review>< pics>

< review>
The trail to Switzer fall for most part is easy. Lots of water crossing and rock hopping back and forth. At about 1 mile in before you begin the the incline, you can follow the stream to get a view of the top of Switzer fall. Turn around and go back up the trail. Once you get to the top and start your decent down the trail to the fall, more stream crossing and rock hopping. you will see your first fall. This is where most people stop have snack take pictures.  But it's not Switzer fall. If you are adventures you can clime the right side of the fall and keep going up stream for about 5 minutes hike and you will be at Switzer fall.<//review>

<Review>It’s a well maintained beautiful trail! Not so much elevation, perfect for beginners! The true falls, however, is not the first one most people stop—you can find the taller one further down. A bit rock climbing, but not too far from the first one! Very refreshing!<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>The beginning of the trails was nice, lots of rocks. It starts to get a little narrow after you go up a hill. Only one person can walk by. It can be scary if you don’t like heights but it was worth seeing the falls. Going back to the entrance was easier until you have to go up that hill. I was literally dying. That was work out of a lifetime. 😂😂< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Excellent easy trail to a small waterfall.  The hike follows the creek and then climbs up the side of the mountain for a bit before descending to the waterfall.  Most of the trail is nicely shaded with lots of vegetation.  Several water crossings depending on how much rain there is.  Get there early for parking down by the picnic area.  Pit toilets at the picnic area.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBcK5ghUJt2AtMwb26qypocJYUjcCHNrnheWwS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPV1c5DJcvIe9DoKq6dAPwEw7H6qk1lduxCj1wc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCCUhHbQplY15FwN5MGAVfmu3j5mW4oyBX57LU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ-hsSgA-znS33DSM33nxFS1f4vmitIB22K0p7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOC4jgMeIhS6Je4Q09xSo-3fk2iNQ4u_4NkLY0J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDHmCmTzWiSR-h39KTuK4QZIxzZ02MZ3l79J1s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< username>

Been here before, it was awesome. I was planning on going again soon and seeing as there are current comments I am assuming this trail is open? Also is it super crowded?<//Review>

<review>Although it's small it's a big waterfall in LA county already. The water is super big in winter and beginning of spring. It’s challenging even to cross the river at that time. In the beginning of winter, the water is almost dead. Easy to hike<//review><userid>116195846997239439991< /userid>< time>

This place is amazing. Be ready to get wet! Due to the rainy season there is absolutely no way to get to the waterfall without getting wet. There is also some ice on the trail so be extremely careful. Other than that it's a beautiful hike with amazing views.</review>

Quick drive up here to take the family for some outdoors. There is a trail that leads all the way down to JPL, and is a really good hike. There is water at the station near JPL, so I suggest hiking from Switzer down, then refill on water and hike back instead of the reverse.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Go to the intersection of the first waterfall and the second waterfall, there is no sign.
The water in this stream is not suitable for drinking, and washing hands can hurt your hands.
I have passed the stream many times along the road, and the scenery is beautiful.
3.5km one way

前往第一個瀑布與第二個瀑布的叉路口, 沒有標示.
這條溪的水質不宜飲用, 洗手也感覺會傷手.
沿路過溪很多次, 風景很美.

Wendy was the sales rep. She was terrific. Explained everything I wanted to know very patiently, and helped me narrow down my choice with respect to options I wanted. Buy all my appliances at Manuel Joseph. Love that place.</review>

First off, this may not seem like a fair REVIEW because, I was given their name from a competitor.

As I recall a salesman that I had dealt with for years told me they didn't have what I wanted. He referred me to the company listed above.
He said, they were honest, maybe slightly more in costs but great service.
I purchased a refrigerator and freezer many years ago and am extremely happy with the outcome.

The owner recommended that I purchase a larger freezer but I did not take his recommendation and regret that decision since. Our dryer broke down after many years and I decided to purchase another one instead of repairing it.
It's a HEAVY DUTY model similar to the ones used at the laundry mat.
We purchased a model similar to the one that broke down.
The service provided has been perfect so far and we don't expect any different in the future.</text>

Purchased GE Double Oven from Manuel Joseph appliance. The oven never worked from the first day. The bottom oven would not turn on. GE  technician came out to repair the brand new oven.  He had to order parts for a brand new oven. Totally dissatisfied with GE products. It’s been three weeks and the oven is still not repaired.</Review>

I show we set up a service call for you but I wasn't aware of any delays that GE had in repairing your oven.  Please reach out to me and I'll see if I can expedite the repair.  Thank you, Jay Joseph"}</response>< gmapID>

<text>I bought a GE refrigerator 1 1/2 yrs ago from Manuel Joseph Appliance Center.  I try to do business locally, so even though I pay a bit more than I would have at Sears or Home Depot,  I thought I would get better service.
Boy was I wrong!!!  Refrigerator stopped working after 1 year and a half, and guess what.  The warranty is only good for one year and the person that answered the phone wasn't the least bit sympathetic to the fact that it is 100 degrees out and the fridge is cooling and I am losing $100 worth of food.  Back to Sears for me.<//text>< user_name>

{'time': 1465341996097, 'text': "Hi Patricia,  I'm very sorry for the trouble you're having with the refrigerator.  We have set up a service provider to look at your refrigerator tomorrow.  (We utilize GE Factory Service and unfortunately this was the earliest time slot they had available.)  We have called GE to add you to a priority wait list in the event that an earlier service call becomes available.\n\nI'm truly sorry you didn't get the service from us on the phone that you needed. Please call me directly and I would be very happy to help you with this problem. I can be reached at 916-923-5646.  Jay Joseph"}< /response>

Go to this store for all appliance needs, you won't be disappointed.  They really are there to serve their customers.   No pressure sales.  And they stand behind their products.<//text>

This place has awesome customer service!! I called inquiring about my washer that would not spin and Jay Jospeh answered the phone and really went above and beyond to help me remedy the issue. I would definitely recommend and I will continue to purchase from this store.< /review>

Buy your appliances here! The sales people know what they are talking about! They match the big box store prices, are extremely helpful, and are very loyal to their customers. Let's keep local businesses alive.< /text>

At its peak, this was one of the coolest spots in Sacramento to kick it. When I first heard this place was closing, it made me feel sad. However I realized that times have changed. Hopefully one day they reinvent themselves and reoccupy this cool location.<//Text>

<Date>1455505706898< /Date><text>It's is a bit pricey for the location. It used to be a very good place too eat. The restaurant has really gone down hill. The rooms have sleep number beds which is nice, but, if you get a room on the back side of the hotel, Costco is on the other side of the fence and you'll hear trucks coming and going all night. The rooms walls are very thin as well. They have a small casino on premise and the hotel lobby and common areas are very nice.</text>< user_name>

Grounds are beautiful, very expansive.  Our room was clean, outside noise was not at all an issue.  Food was very good.  The only negative is the location of ice/vending machines, but if you don't mind walking a bit, not a big issue.  I would stay again.<//review>

Very old rooms, not good service at the lobby, carpet stained, paint peeling.  The room was clean.  The bed was comfortable, but it was an air mattress and the pump was not working right.  Very small room also.  Not worth the price.  THE PROPERTY IS CLOSED<//Review>

Attended a meeting here and the staff was very attentive to our group.  For about 200 people.. the ballroom worked well. We were provided wireless mics that worked great and a sound system to plug our devices into. Some attendees complained after a whole it was too cold in the room with the AC blasting and soon after..it was turned off and the rest of the meeting the temperature was good.<//text>

The staff was nice a friendly, our room was "okay" we had to ask to switch rooms because didn't seem they cleaned out our room. Again, staff was kind and friendly to move us to another room (which we appreciate). This room was clean, our kids had fun swimming in the pool and we enjoyed walking around the entire property (huge property). Really liked walking to the Koi pond and taking pictures. Will stay again.< /Text>< Pics>

For the price this hotel provided a great experience which could not be beat. All rooms faced a lovely lake, pool and courtyard. There was a large out door hot tub by the pool as well.  The food I took out from the restaurant was fresh and well prepared... Caesar salad, cheese quesadilla and burger. We ate by the pool in a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Rooms were clean and staff was sweet,professional and helpful.  I will be back on my next trip to Sacramento.<//text>

3 star to 3.5 stars if it had room service runner  on golf cart be nice. On-Site laundry would be nice or Pick up room runners and press and foild service. Your guys listening up date plugs, patch wholes correctly and update lighting this place is an easy 4 star hotel</Review>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>The rooms were musty, nasty, and dingy overall. I got sick just breathing in the room. The place really needs to be torn down as the real estate could be used to build a good hotel or something. I understand that investors want to monetize as long as they can on their properties but in the hotel industry where folks health and well being is at stake, its better to rebuild or try another method other than just milking all you can out of a property when its long been time to shut it down.Eventually the word will get out and most people will not want to stay there …well Quality people anyway.< /Text><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Do not stay here. Our room was back in the dark creepy area. We all saw spiders, there was hair in both the sink & bath tub,  causing water to pool & the maid 'missed' cleaning our room. There were rat droppings in the other room. While the staff was friendly &the pool is nice, the rooms are rundown<//Text>

This is an OK hotel. You can tell it used to be really nice in its hay day,  but has since fallen to age. The pond is pretty cool, but you can hear the fountain all night and it's not the usual pleasant sound of water.<//Review>

I would pay 60 dollars a night, at most,  for this hotel. The lobby is nice, but that's it. No refrigerator, bag of trash left outside our door, showers rusty and out of date, sleep number bed remote had no batteries, not all of the outlets worked, front desk button on phone didn't work so I called using my phone and got put on hold for a long time. Service, quality, and cleanliness were all lacking for the price paid. This is an economy class stay, think motel 6 or super 8.<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I have been to the hotel on several occasions.  The front desk staff is exceptional.  I do not understand how anyone can rate them rude.  Everyone you meet has a smile upon their face from the front desk to the house keepers to the grounds keepers.  I have over heard if a guest had a complaint while waiting, they quickly addressed the problem to the appropriate solution staff immediately to ensure a guest satisfaction at least to my satisfaction that I would expect an immediate response. The private conference rooms are clean and set appropriate to any business meeting needs.  The outside lake setting with the water spouts is comforting to sit by and relax for meditation or a moment just to breath. The pool is crisp and clean. They have a nice little shop, and coffee shop.   The hotel is beautiful,  They have a very romantic, comfortable setting night club and lounge.  The food is beyond exceptional.  I feel they go beyond the call of duty to make your stay enjoyable.  If you smell chemicals know you have a clean room!  Some people have allergies like myself and appreciate no sprays to cover up as it saves on my senses.  I rather know a room is clean.< /Review>< Pics>

This hotel seems to be run down,  much renovation needed. It does serve the need for my venue though, just wish it were in better shape.< /Review>

Close to the Sacramento Expo right off Exposition Blvd. Reasonable rate (discounted because it was the sponsored hotel for an AMA race at the track). Believe me, all the hotels within a 20 minute drive were completely booked that weekend and very expensive because of the MX race and Flat Trak race. Don't wait until the last minute to book reservations and check the events calendar for the days you'll be staying in the area.<//text>

First at check in I change my mind about my two day stay to one, was very difficult and confusing finding place, the man a desk said when I check out tomarrow they would just bill me for one nite.  As I check my bank balance during that same afternoon they had billed me for two notes and plus $75 deposit that is would not get back until 3 to 4 days later... Unbelievable, place is old and dirty, I was given a room in the back bungalows 😡< /Text>

Have stayed here before, it's an older hotel but fairly well kept up. However this time have runbinto some issues, a broken button on the thermostat, power strips that have gotten blown fuses (after being Daisy chained together), as well as the room being rekeyed during the evening causing all our keys not to work in the morning.<//review>

This place is a JOKE!! The pictures online are soooooo different from what it really is!!  We made reservations for 2 nights, 2 adults 3 kids we requested 2 beds.  First off we thought it was all in close proximity to the pool, boy was I wrong it was a 1/4 mile away from our room!  You hear Red Lion and think nice hotel, no no no not here. The room was so dated the inside of the door was dirty it was so gross!!  The beds were not double beds at all twin maybe!  It smelled so bad like smoke I couldn't even take my kids in there.  We drove back to the front desk (the only nice thing there) because walking is out of the question we asked for a different room they said they were booked and had nothing else. I said it smells like smoke I can't have my baby in that room. The lady said oh I can cancel your room , we did just that .  I then called the credit card company just to
Confirm and guess what charge is still on there thankfully our card company is dealing with it.  We went to the Hyatt which is soooo much better !! If I could give them negative stars I would stay far away!!  And there is no fridge!!! Even cheap hotels have fridges!!< /Text>

<review>This is a wonderful hotel with a beautiful view of a lake.  The staff is very friendly and the cleaning of the rooms are daily.  The rooms are spacious and business grade.  You have free wi-fi, ice, central heating/air, clean linen, adjustable beds (sleep number), coffee maker, alarm clock radio, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap.  The view of the lake was grand with a fountain, geese on the water, a Koi fish pond with it's own fountain and a nice pathway.  The hotel also has a swimming pool with a safety fence a small amphitheater area with soft music coming through speakers when not in use. There are ice rooms located around the property with soda machines.

The convention rooms are elegant and host many events. There is a Grill that serves and offers room service, a Bar but my favorite is the dining room.  The breakfasts were fresh cooked daily whether it was served or buffet and refilled often.  The morning servers along with the chef and cooks were very friendly and personable. They were my favorite part of the experience not excluding Sylvia at the front desk.

The rooms are very clean along with their bathrooms. Because of the fear of bed bugs in some of the local motels and extended stay hotels this was a pleasant experience. alleviating those concerns. All concerns are addressed immediately (not that there should be any but things can happen).

Do be aware that during the wet season it tended to flood in front of the entrance to the hotel's property. (This might have been addressed by now)

This hotel is a definite Yes and a Must Try.< /review>< Rate>

The hotel is somewhat dated but has a lot charm. Most of the rooms are facing a large lake with a large water fountain in the middle. Rooms are reasonably large with sleep number beds and the standard ameneties. Good front desk and huskeeping staff. They need to infuse some cash to upgrade it to competative hotels in the area. The hotel is in a strange area but it very close to to downtown, Arden Fair, business 80 freeway and lots of restaurants and shopping. The hotel is a good value, but needs some work.<//review>

<review>Ok first I don't know where some of these nut jobs were staying, but I have been at this motel for 4 days for work. I am from San Francisco. I have been in construction for most of my life and even a building inspector at one time in the city of San Francisco. I have not seen any evidence that this is anything but a lovely place to stay. There are hundreds of units on the property, so maybe it could be true that there are a few bad ones as the odds are in favor of that. However my co worker who is staying at the Marriott nearby says she wants to stay here  instead. In fact we do work in many high end Hotels for a living. And from what I ave seen, this place is a 3-4 star depending on your taste.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>4<//Rating>< username>

The staff is very friendly but this place is old, not maintained and not clean. .  My room smells so it was sprayed with Febreeze.  The beds are very hard, like the beds use to be in hotels 20 years ago.  With the conferences on weekdays you cannot even park by your room some days.  No refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms unless you want to pay and extra $25/day each.  Not recommended at all.</review>

Dated is an understatement.  Switches, plugs, coffee maker and the sleep number bed sucked... every plug and switch! Room smelled like cigarettes,  and the shower was equivalent to the bathroom sink water. Paid for the "breakfast buffet", was behind someone else getting food and the attendent comes out and says it's not open yet. She says it opens in 10 minutes, and proceeds to give more attitude?<//text>

This place is terrible. My husband and I were paying for my sister-in-law and her daughter to stay there after their house caught fire. We got our original deal through Hotwire for $68/night. Once that reservation was up, we weren't able to extend at that rate and from there, everything went horribly down hill. They changed the rate every night, ranging from $120 to $165, always with a different excuse. Their website said $79/night weekdays and $109/night on weekends. They explained with different reasons each time why we could not get those rates. The staff was the rudest bunch I have ever encountered and the manager was even worse as we over heard her telling the trainee she was working with "And that's how you do it" after charging us the highest amount they had so far. The morals that staff has is shameful and the Red Lion should be ashamed of this location to the fullest, taking advantage of people the way they are and finding it humorous. Shame on them. We moved our family members to the Best Western HOTEL (not a MOTEL like the Red Lion) in a much nicer neighborhood, much better reviews and a much nicer establishment for $110/night. I'm not sure why we didn't go there first since we travel often and usually stay at one of their establishments, it is the LAST time I will ever go there, I wouldn't stay there if they gave me an entire month free and that is the absolute truth. By the way, I forgot to mention the man a few doors down that had quite a few street prostitutes come back to his room and the cleanliness of the room was sub-par at best.</Review>

What a dump.  Checked into my room and immediately visited the front desk to get another one.  When I pulled back the covers I found hairs in the sheets and the mattress was a mess.  A sleep number with no working numbers.  This room should have been condemned not rented.  With there was a way to rate this place zero stars.< /Review>

<date>1468648859626<//date><review>I reserved a room that would sleep two adults and three kids.  They said "no problem" my room had two full beds in it.  I dont know in what world three kids (two nine year old and a 5 year old) could fit on a full bed.  So i called down to ask for a roll away bed....15 dollars a night extra, and if the room has two beds already, we cant have a roll away bed too.  Are you kidding me? So one of my kids has to sleep on the floor now.  So we unpack our stuff, no fridge! Thats another 15 bucks a night. Ive stayed in tons of hotels in my time in the service, this is the first place ive ever been to that didnt have a fridge in the room, let alone have to pay for it.  I will never stay at one of these places again.< /review><Name>matt detzel<//Name><gmap_id>0x809ad7525386930f:0x1ce2d320129712b8< /gmap_id><UserId.>107002016340894590810<//UserId.>< Rating>

<Review>my husband and I were there last week and our experienced to that hotel was a nightmare.   The room we got smelled so badly, it was dirty and filthy.  I wasn't able to use their towel as it seemed it was already used and never been washed.  They even asigned us way at the back of  the hotel where noone had checked in.  OMG that was scary.  If you are trying to check in to Red Lion in Sacramento, think twice!  Don't be deceive by the picture only or the front building because because behind it is so ghetto.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I stayed at Room 106 and paranormal activity went on at around 12-2 where the phone would ring and nobody was there, and my door would open around the same time, some friends also stayed over at Room 105/107 and their TV would turn on randomly, nice hotel, creepy things going on.  dont recommend</text>

<Text>The place is a bit dated.  We were in the conference rooms and the place was extremely cold.  The restrooms were all the way in the lobby unless you count the 2 single person bathrooms near the conference area, for which you had to stand in line for.</Text>< Pictures>

The staff are super nice, which is why I feel bad giving it only 1 star, but my god this place is a dump. The rooms smell of mildew, they face the outside (motel style), and some of the other guests are a little unsavory. I walked around and smelled a couple people smoking pot and I was driving all the way around the back of the hotel to park next to my room, I saw a couple shady people just loitering...

The pictures look nice and the prices similar to other hotels in the area like the Double Tree by Hilton, suggest it may be nice...but this place is GHETTO!!<//text>

Please do not go to Kaiser on Ave S and 40th East!
The imaging tech Janelle Carr will really make you wait if you happen to show up early because you never got a reminder as to the day and time of your appointment.
She really singled me out made me come back in one hour and then made me wait almost four hours for my exam instead of having me come back at my appointment time 3:15pm
I have been here since 11:30
What a witch.< /text>

This hospital it is great for blood test, medical appointments like check ups, pharmacy, flu shots, paper work etc. If you have an emergency or need urgent care you must go to the Lancaster Kaiser. The staff here is very friendly and the pharmacy is small but nice.</text>

< review>
My family sees Dr Cho. We are seen on time and in a timely manner. Any outside supports are arranged in a timely way, sometimes faster than I'm ready for. I prefer not to miss work, and I like using holiday time for physicals, etc. I wish I had switched to Kaiser a while back. BC doctors would have you waiting for an hour in the waiting room, then an additional hour in the patient room, then almost an hour to check out. Who has that time?! I always wondered who these people were who were not waiting 4 hours or more to complete a scheduled visit, 5 hours for urgent care.  I like that all my care is in one place and that my Doc recommends anything I might need. There was no advantage to BC/PPO with such long wait times for anything.< /review>

< Review>
I had the worse experience yesterday. I suffer from Panic Attacks, haven't had one in a long time. but was heading home, and took the Palmdale way from LA, I got sick, asked to be dropped off at the nearest Kaiser, and was refused service, because although my blood pressure was high, they didn't want to see me, and instructed me to go to another hospital. and provided me with the address. I could not breathe, but they didn't care. I had to call 911 from there lobby, because they would not call them for me. the Security called 911, I was transported to Palmdale Regional, and that was worse. I had to call family and have them to drive like a bat out of Hell to get me to Victorville Kaiser before Urgent care closed at 9pm. What happened to me was not acceptable. I have been on my job for 22 years, and have paid into Kaiser the entire 22 years, with no breaks. I have had my co-payment increased, several times, and I hear others who pay $5 or nothing. and this is the treatment that I get. my husband don't like Kaiser, and I'm on his insurance, I promoted them so much, after many years he changed our insurance, and now we have dual insurance (Kaiser) and this is what I get in return. as soon as open enrollment comes, I am disenrolling from them. I'm unhappy with this.</Review>

I came in today for my first check up in years, I arrived 30 minutes prior to my appointment with DR CHO. I was seated in both the main waiting room and exam room for about 30 minutes before being seen, to begin the check up she wasn't in communication with her nurse that I was gonna have a phsycal performed. Then thru the physical she was spread thru it and seemed to be in a rush; 2:30 is her last appointment. But I proceeded and had to have a chest X-ray, she let the nurse and myself know I needed to return immiditetly after my exam, I must admit it was no more than 15 minutes from leaving her door with paperwork to leaving my yellow sheet in the Dropbox, 2 minute wait time in the lobby and I was led into a exam room. Hour later in the room a nurse comes into check on me and is amazed to find me there still waiting. I am new to the health care field but if this is a common or simple mistake I don't wanna return or even reconsider having kaiser as a provider. I wish I could have Pleased Ask for the doctors resume before choosing them all jokes aside</text>

<Review>We found this beautiful little restaurant while searching locally in Chino for a place to eat and what a gem! The service is superb and the food excellent! The roasted cauliflower and free range chicken was delicious! My girl had the shortrib plate that was also so good! Well be back soon!</Review>< user_id>

A Gem in the Chino Valley that you must visit. Location is not your usual "restraunt" property but once you enter the doors your experience will be an excellent one. Starters please try the Mushrooms and Bone Marrow, winning is all I have to say. Entrees I have had have been the steak fritz and scallops, both amazing. You must pair your dinner with their wines, and you'll have a great meal.</text>

Must come try this beautiful restaurant!!!  The food was outstanding, the service was just as good (ask for Mary, she was great!) and even the owners came over to chat with us.  They have wine tasting as well which we will do the next time we go.  We had the chicken parmesan and pasta, the brusschetta and tomatoes bisque and it was all delicious! Reasonable prices and generous portions.  Can't wait to go back!<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Came here after searching Yelp for a date night  in the area. Glad to see this place lived up to the great reviews. We had the wine flight and loved all the wines. We also shared the cheese plate for appetizer it was great would definitely recommend. The chicken parmesan was delicious as was the spaghetti and the salmon dinner. Our server was friendly and attentive. We loved the vibe and the live music. Great relaxing place for a date night or just to catch up with friends.<//Review>< user_id>

If you are in Southern California, you should check this place out.
Words won't do justice to describe how great their wines and foods are.
People here are the pros of pros, they are very nice and knowledgeable of their craft. We live in CARSON, CA , 30 mile drive, but this place just became our go to place if we are in need of great wines with awesome foods</text>

Atmosphere was nice and quaint, but overall pricey!
My Cesar salad, well, their presentation to me was very odd. Let me just say croutons were the size of a golf ball and just as hard, not edible. Served with a whole stem of romain lettuce.  So after I cut up my romaine stem, my Caesar salad was lettuce and dressing!  Let me add, others in my party enjoyed their dinner selection. My salad was the talk of the table and we, I just laughed it off!</review>

An unexpected but pleasant little restaurant located on the side of a quiet stripmall, Vinter's Tavern creates a rustic and cozy environment, perfect for groups or couples looking to enjoy a night out. As soon as we entered, we were greeted by our friendly host and serenaded with live music coming.

We were seated in the smaller alcove sectioned room with only 3 other tables which was nice. I don't think that room is normally open because there was air conditioning parts laying around but it works out because the main area was quite loud.

We ordered a flight of Wine and for starters, we ordered the bone marrow and the mussels, for mains we tried the vegetable melange and Vinter's Burger and finished the meal off with the. Creme brule.  The food was good but it doesn't match up to other fine dining restaurants. The Creme brule was the weakest part of the meal.< /review>

1 star on the wines.didn't eat the food so I'll give them 3 stars and the benefit of the doubt.we tried both wine flights and didn't like any of them at all. Our tastes are more towards Napa, Sonoma, Santa Barbara, Oregon and Washington wineries. These are nothing like that. Nice looking place though, weird location in a plaza that gets few visitors.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Literally stumbled across this place while on an evening walk with my wife. On impulse, we went inside for a glass of wine and a nosh -- we were VERY impressed!  Wound up trying several very tasty small plates and a flight of four wonderful red wines, including an excellent Tempranillo and a truly exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon. Service was friendly and attentive, never rushed yet never an unfilled water glass or empty plate left on the table. We will definitely be going back again!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Time>1515813197889< /Time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Really enjoyed an evening at Vinters. Restaurant is the brainchild of Emeril a lovely gentleman who owns his own vineyard. He showcases his wines as well as a select few others. This is strictly a wine bar. We only had a few items from the menu. All were very good. Hamburger featured on an Amish bun was lovely. The bun is slightly sweet similar to a brioche. Burger was topped with a little blue cheese, caramelized onions and truffle mayo. Absolutely fantastic! I liked that the salads could be ordered as a half. Even as a half it was huge!! Unfortunately, I can’t drink red wine and the 2 whites they offered didn’t work for me. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is so delightful (did I mention the guitarist? Fabulous!). Take your best guy or girl, hire a babysitter and have an adult evening out. Go visit Emeril, have a great dinner and enjoyable glass of wine..you’ll thank me!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Great restaurant (albeit scary from the outside)
The owner of the restaurant comes to every table and communicates !!!
The owner has his own winery and offers a wine menu 👍👍👍 ..
The owner is Filipino, his last name on every wine glass !!

If you buy 5 bottles of wine here, you get a member sheep with a 20% discount and everyone who has a member ship-owner invites you to his home !!!
Bowl Soup bowl is a very large portion.
Oooch meatball pasta large portion

(Original)
Отличный ресторан (хотя с наружи страшненько )
Хозяин ресторана подходит к каждому столику и общается!!!
Хозяин имеет свою личную винодельню и предлагает  wine menu 👍👍👍..
Хозяин филиппинец ,его фамилия на каждом винном бокале !!

Если купить здесь 5 бутылок вина -то получаешь member sheep с 20% скидкой и  все ,кто имеет мембер шип-хозяин приглашает к себе домой   !!!
Суп bowl ооочень большая порция 😁.
Паста с фрикадельками оооч большая порция<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPuLgkLhbMz-3ILUzRL5L0LQBDfwmxwSKlJKOp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmIqFgSEupbwO3PYHTJb58X71hDg63KT8b_DU3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I researched for a place to do service on my road bike. Mark's bike shop had
excellent reviews so I gave this place a try. They provided excellent service and they went way above and beyond what they needed to do to fix my bike. They have great knowledge and are very friendly. My bike is better than it was when it was new. I give thanks to everyone who works there, they were very helpful. If I could give them 10⭐'s I would.<//Review>

This place is great.  It is right off of the Pacific Electric Trail which is very convenient to all who bike it!  The customer service is awesome...i was helped by a Lady who was courteous, knowledgeable, and super kind and friendly.  I picked up a nice little seat storage type pouch.  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL ECONOMY...this place is awesome!<//text>

Lately I've been to shops in 3 counties and 3  shops just in Rancho alone. I can say each shop has their own vibe and none of it was good. Each shop seems to tailor to specific riding and if you're not one of them you're not welcome. Mark welcomes everyone, his shop feels like a real bike shop, he has everything and takes his time to give top notch service. I will gladly spend my hard earned money on a local business like Marks.< /text>

<review>Called today to get my rear hub adjusted/fixed. Mark stated he was backlogged for the next two weeks but offered to take a look at my bike nonetheless as I had my bike with me and I was in the area. He wound up stopping what he was doing to work on my bike and fix it on the spot at a very fair price. Not only is was it totally unexpected but he was genuinely cordial and a did a superb job. Thanks Mark. You’ve got my business for life.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I recommend Marks shop to anyone who appreciates good, old fashioned customer appreciation and service.  EVERYONE in the shop is personable, techs are amazing, prices are great, and you will always be treated as though you are family.  I wish every company, organization, and just person in general were REQUIRED to conduct themselves as the staff at Marks Bike Shop does.  Thanks To everyone at Marks for being THE BEST BIKE SHOP AROUND!!!</Text>

Dropped off my bike was told it would take 1 to 2 weeks (I guess it takes a pandemic to get people on bikes) but 2 days later it was ready. Great pricing, friendly service and my bike rides like a dream now! Thanks so much!<//Text>

They are polar opposite to Roy's Cycler in Upland, California. I will always go to and refer friends and family to Mark's Bicycle Shop and NOT Roy's Cycler who denied me service as soon as I walked in the door without knowing what I wanted done on my nephew's preschooler bike. Mark fixed it quickly and went the extra mile in shinning it up. Thank you so much Mark and staff. You are the BEST!</text>< userid>

They did an excellent job on repairing my classic Electra beach cruiser. They went the extra mile for me in all the details. I'm glad I took it to them. The bike means to me.

As always a place that makes you smile all at the same time inform me about my recumbent tire stems. Was told have to turn them to fill and close to not release the air. They are European stems. So in saying this, another cycling shop charged me for tubes, said they were punctured. I then drove my bike to Mark's Bicycle Shop and learned this at no charge and since I'm disabled they never ever hesitate to take my three wheeler out and put it in. Mark always smiling, asks how your dogs doing.
In my home town - Rancho Cucamonga, CA.
Go see them for any and everything!< /text>

I needed an old MTB shock rebuilt.  Mark got that done for me at minimal cost.  Eventually I bought another bike and crashed it a couple of times.  Mark fixed it right up. Mark and his guys do great work. It's nice to be able to support a local small business and get awesome service and really good prices. I also bought a Kali helmet, at Mark's suggestion, and I put it to the test by crashing and cracking the helmet in three places.  It saved my skull.< /review>

Best Bike shop ever......awesome customer service, high quality bikes and tune ups/repairs! Great prices! I bought my son a BMX bike and had my specialized Mountain Bike serviced and had new tires and brake pads put on....when I picked it up it was like a brand new bike and it was over 10 years old! My son loves his BMX bike too.....High Quality Bike!
Small business like this is leagues above the box stores!!< /Review>

I have been cycling for several years now.  And, I am definitely NOT a cycling guru.  So, I shopped around and had a ton of work done at different places over a span of about three years.  Then, after many hundreds of dollars and several different places later, I found Mark's Bicycle Shop.  It was  recommended to me by a friend.  Although prior recommendations about other bicycle shops never panned out, I thought, what the heck.

Let me just tell you, Mark and his staff are by far the best and most attentive staff of any bicycle shop that I have ever frequented.  It's got that "mom and pop" feel, but is very professional, and competitive in price and selection.  I have done everything through this shop concerning my bicycle, and riding, from purchasing gear all the way to having a yearly full service done to my bicycles.  I am never unsatisfied, even one bit.

The best part is, Mark takes pride in everything that he does.  This definitely rubs off on his staff.  All of the personnel that he hires has extensive knowledge about cycling, and treats customers with the utmost care and respect.  If you were like me, taking your bicycle to a larger chain store, and have been dissatisfied, my recommendation would be to try out Mark's shop.  Far and above one of the best businesses in all of Rancho Cucamonga.

They have a loyal customer in me, that's for sure.<//Review>

I've purchased a number of bikes from Mark's over the years.  It's always amazing how well they ride after an overhaul.  They ride like they are new.
Great locally owned and operated business.  I completely recommend Mark's Bike Shop.<//Review>

It's no surprise why Mark's bike shop gets a high rating from reviewers.  They do not disappoint when it comes down to bike repairs and certainly great advice.   I put my bike through 22 miles of gruelling territory that burned my front tire totally beyond repair.  I'm so glad I decided on Mark's & thank God right before they closed.   My Bike ended up getting an upgrade; love my new high performance tire & heavy duty inner tube.
Everyone in this shop were so very friendly.  I enjoyed our conversation & much needed information to keep my bike performing at its best for years to come.
The shop is stocked to the fullest with not only nice bikes but some of the best accessories.   I ended up buying more than I expected and glad I did.  I've learned my lesson, I rather be 💯% prepared than not thanks to Mark's.< /Text>

My opinion is tougher than others being I worked in a family bike shop for 10years. Mark and his team remind me of exactly that, family. Not many places great you with a firm handshake and warm welcome.  He sized my wife and I up with a glance at our exact height And showed us options based on what we were looking to do. I already had a set mind on what we were looking for going in but he made a recommendation and 2x bikes that were actually cheaper on the tag but better value for the riding we want to do. I can't stress enough on how awesome this place is! Great staff, great bikes, and a shop above the rest! Make this your first stop when wanting a bike!</Text>

I am so impressed with the amazing customer service in this shop.  The help and support provided to us and our grandson was over and above anything they were required to do.  They make supporting small businesses VERY easy!  They have a customer for life.< /Text>

I had a luck to have MR mark work on my wheels. He did an awsome job. Very affordable.  Didn't offer me anything that I didn't need. This will be my home shop.< /text>

Best bike shop ever! Super nice and very helpful. I have an old schwinn that I had gone to other bikes shops that just blew me off. They were great!! Not only did they have the parts they fixed it for no problem! I’m riding again and will never go anywhere else again! Can’t wait to go back and buy my 6 year old new bike for christmas there.<//Text>

I like that they have a great assortment for the benefit of their customers. Those options are helpful whenever you are a little out of a band, they will find what suits your bike most.<//text>

Excellent work. Very professional and nice guys too. They arrived early and took great care wrapping my heavy items in blankets and saran wrap. Upon arrival, they used creative thinking to fit my items where they had to go, which was not simple. Took great care to make sure they didn't scratch my floors or walls. I would use them again Ina heartbeat. Hire these guys!< /review>

Very impressed, we already referred to 2 of our friends. Fast, efficient and professional. Very dedicated and committed to the service they provide and the clients they serve. The best moving company ever and the least expensive. Simon and Daniel were very friendly, knowledgeable and very passionate about what they do and it really shows!!! They arrived on time, fulfilled every promise they made. Would use them over and over again. I highly recommend if you are moving that you use Fast and Easy moving Company. You definitely will not be disappointed!!!!!!! Bill and Michelle (2 very satisfied customers)< /Review>

These guys are simply the BEST. This is the second time I have hired them and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use any other moving company in the future. I manage a French Restaurant in Central LA and needed to move the entirety of our business. I was happy to be greeted by two trucks to help expedite everything and employees that are concerned with the care of all items as well as speed. Their pricing is beyond fair and as opposed to other moving companies I have worked with in the past these guys work fast to help keep the overall cost down for me.</review>

The name stands up! It was truly fast and easy! Really glad i went with these guys for my move. The flat rate makes it  simple, no hidden fees.  Showed up on time, and wasted no time getting the job done. It went faster than expected! They were also super kind and went over the top helping my husband and I move. I will definitely be using them again and will recommend to all I know. Thank you for taking care of us!<//review>

Einars and his team were awesome! They were very professional, friendly and efficient. I was especially impressed with their problem solving abilities and their tenacity - they were hired to move a soundproof meeting pod that is oversized and heavy (approx 1000lbs). Every roadblock encountered was easily resolved, and the pod was removed and delivered with no issues. I love their teamwork and can-do attitude - I would highly recommend anyone moving to use their service!< /Text>

<text>The last time I moved was from LA to Little Armenia three years ago, and I did not have a good experience with that moving company. This time, I spoke to friends who suggested Fast & Easy Moving because they were professional, gave the best quote, and got the job done quickly.

I am so happy that I followed my friends’ advice because Einars was amazing! When he says “everything is included,” it is not a joke! I have a rather large wardrobe, and they packed it in seconds. My things were taken care of in the transition from one home to another, and I felt a huge wave of relief as he was working.

If you’re like me and working in the industry, you don’t have time to do all of this yourself, and if you find the time, you are probably exhausted from your long working hours. Treat yourself to a move that happens so fast, you’ll blink and be in your new home. I promise!

Happy moving, and thank you, again, Einars!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuz8kqJt1kSNl7bYFZtBFnDn99Z1mKXKET5eYL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkP_siAEoXJS4jiiMRRZNiPW5Wm6LqqxnWPY5l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621223682546, 'text': 'Appreciated your review'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

This company is great! Super fast and efficient. I love Einars, he’s amazing! He was so quick and had his technique down to a T.  He wrapped all my stuff and made sure nothing got damaged!!! I’ve had experiences with moving companies in the past and they’ve damaged furniture. I was skeptical using another moving company but this place was amazing!!! I will definitely be hiring them again, hopefully not anytime soon but if I do or when i do move again haha 😂</review>

<review>A great experience! Einard and team is the best. Very professional, respectful and courteous with my elderly mother who was moving, and so good with communicating times and details even throughout the move. They moved everything so carefully, left the storage unit clean, and not a scratch on any walls or a single broken item. We were so pleased with the service and will definitely recommend Fast and Easy Moving for anyone who asks.

<Review>My friend referred Fast and Easy Moving to me for a very stressful situation.  The owner was one of the fastest and professional person I have ever dealt with in my entire Moving situation. I definitely would also recommend his services to anyone who depends on the best price and experience 😉

Awesome service, awesome people. Very professional at what they do and how they approach every move. A piece of furniture “not fitting” isn’t in their vocabulary. They lifted and wedged my new couch through my balcony to make sure the job got done. A+</text>

Lucky you! You are reading a review for a stellar moving company. What qualities are you looking for? They’re fast, efficient, fair rates, accommodating — simply put, just competent. Isn’t this what you want for your precious belongings? I was apprehensive in hiring someone to move my items from LA to Austin, and I am so grateful that I found Fast and Easy moving. Einars was incredibly accommodating when I had to change my date and arrived promptly when I was ready to schedule and survey the job. I had fun chatting with him as well... he’s incredibly intelligent, personable and funny. He made me feel secure in sending my items with him across the country. I’ll update with more when I’m moved into my place in Austin, Texas!</review>

<Review>This company is a 10/10!! They went above and beyond and were working hard in 80 degree weather to get us in our new place as fast as possible. I'm very particular about how people handle my belongings as I have expensive furniture and they really took my concerns to heart when they wrapped every piece and communicated to each other my requests. They don't slack and do the best they can in the time given...they dont try to scan you for any extra time. I would use this company again any day and am recommending them to all my friends and family. Thank you!< /Review>< user_name>

<date>1592759476338< /date><rating>5</rating><Text>Fantastic all-inclusive service at a great price point! They came early, prepared well and executed the job with great precision.

I had a difficult job of moving a 400 pound treadmill from an old gym into my condominium, which involved going through very tight spaces and corners. My thought was that they would only be responsible for moving the treadmill, which was a difficult enough job as is. However, when he said this was an all-inclusive service, he really meant it. Einer and his partner literally took apart the treadmill and the associated electronics outside of my unit, brought the whole thing into my unit, and then re-assembled the whole treadmill again - piece by piece.

Overall their attention to detail and prompt service was impressive. They did all of this with masks on. I would not hesitate to use them again for any moving job.

<rating>5< /rating><review>A+ service. And all with a great attitude. I had quite the job and the 3-man team that helped me out did everything with the best attitudes and did everything efficiently and quickly. Made a stressful situation for me very easy and relaxing. Would 100% use them again and highly recommend them to anyone who has a move job. They disassembled and reassembled my furniture, packed up some small things I didn’t get around to packing up yet, my very expensive tv was delivered with the utmost care, they treated my items with great care. Just an all around great experience.< /review>< Pictures>

I was planning to move my stuff to Texas by myself, but glad I didn't! I hired Fast and Easy Moving, and Einars was in and out in less than 30 minutes. The service was right on time and professional. To top it off, I received a ridiculously good rate for a move to Texas compared to all of the other quotes I received. 5 stars!!!< /review>

Einares was great. Kept in touch prior, announced his ETA,  was punctual and boom!, he went into action.
Moved me from Long Beach to Bakersfield. Crew boxed up our smaller boxes for efficiency and disassembled mu queen electric bed & moved my piano. Got to Bakersfield  and the house (and impressively without getting lost) and set about unloading, reassembling and boom!, gone. I can’t thank Einares and crew for making my retirement and relocation easier.
I’d recommend Fast and Easy to anyone. Oh, my daughter Eryn says Hi!</Text>

<text>They did an excellent job helping move a fridge for me. So much so that when it wouldnt got through the door they were able to take down the door to make room and put it back up afterwards. They're hell was greatly appreciated because we couldn't do it ourselves and they charged the lowest hourly out of anyone I could find. They were extremely easy to book as well. I would highly reccomend then to anyone looking to move anything from even one item to their entire home.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2bf3e4d1f6419:0xdd5b590e38c380bb< /gmapID><resp>{'time': 1621223705856, 'text': 'Appreciated your review'}<//resp><UserId.>108405105245807260354<//UserId.></record>

<text>The best movers I have ever used and I’ve moved a lot! I couldn’t be happier with the service I recieved. For the owner of the company to
Come out and assist me on an extremely short notice same day move... they were fast, no
Hidden fees and so so so nice. I will use them for every other move I have ( which hopefully won’t be for some time)

You will not at all regret using this company for your moving needs. The best experience I had. My initial mover was unprofessional and cancelled on me and fast and easy was able to quickly get my booked and showed up within the hour! Words can’t express my gratitude for their help as I would be in a horrible
Position without them.

Thanks guys!< /text>< Rate>

Had a great experience with Fast and Easy Moving!!  I moved a few months back as well, prior to finding Fast and East Moving and was totally ripped off by another moving company in LA.  This time I made sure to ask the right questions and understand how they charge — it’s so straightforward and fair. They move fast and carefully with your belongings! I definitely recommend!< /text>

I rescheduled  due to some last minute changes and he was very accommodating and understanding. I recommend also putting down deposit for the blankets incase your putting things into storage. Nothing was damaged, lost, or mishandled. 5 Stars to a “get it done” type of company without any headaches.< /Text>< user>

<review>I moved from L.A. to Palm Springs.  I didn’t have an excessive amount of items to move, but I was quoted $2400 for door to door service from another company, which didn’t include packing (I prefer to pack myself).  Einard and Pavel arrived early and brought everything, including boxes I didn’t need. They wrapped everything and handled delicate stuff with kid gloves. They hustled and gave me door to door service charged by the hour.  All said and done, it was four times less than the other place, $600 total. On top of it all, they were really friendly guys. I actually feel badly that I gave only $100 for them to split as a tip. I should have given them $100 apiece.  I would recommend Fast and Easy to anyone!<//review><Time>1595452122639< /Time>< user_id>

<Text>Fast and Easy Moving is the perfect name to describe their service and I couldn’t be more happy. They were on time and in communication with me and my furniture was set-up beautifully in my home. They were courtesy and most importantly, there were no hidden fees. Thank you very much!!< /Text>< Pics>

This Moving company is the best!!! It was fast and easy move for sure! My family was moving from big 3000sqft to much smaller size house. We were very stressed out and worried but movers Einars, Oleg and Valery was very professional! Everything worked out better than we could have ever asked. I highly recommend this moving company for your next move. They are not just movers. They take great care of your stuff, also give you emotional support and make some jokes to make it easy. Definitely go with Fast and Easy!!!<//Review>

Fast and Easy Moving is the way to go if you're relocating in Los Angeles!

I sent out a request for movers and they were one of two companies to respond with reasonable accommodations and pricing. I was won over because of their locality. Einars and Vavo were prompt and ready to help us with whatever we needed. I was very pleased with the amount of wardrobe boxes provided, along with their response to any special requests I had.

Einars is a great businessman with one hell of a personality. It only made the move more enjoyable to have such good energy around. Vavo was a wonderful accomplice as well!

If you're looking to move in the L.A. area, please give these guys a try. They won't let you down and will be hard to beat in terms of efficiency, friendliness and a good experience all around.< /text>

I absolutely love this restaurant! Melanie served us this evening, and she was attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond. The fish tacos and creme brûlée are out of this world. Nice, relaxed courtyard atmosphere, stellar menu, ceiling heaters, and lovely view of the hills. Thank you, Melanie and Sea Fresh, for a delicious, fun, relaxed evening!<//Text>

My hubby and I were out to have a fun time  and we decided to try Ojai it's a cute little town with friendly people.  Driving looking for a place to eat we chose seafresh we are glad we did. The server we had was Shelby she is an awesome  server and deserves a raise she delivered ("stellar customer service!") Iam impressed. So" kudos double snaps" to you Shelby, keep delivering your stellar  customer service you rock! The food totally rocked our lunch,clam chowder ,was awesome and so was the halibut and the shrimp.(kudos and double snaps to the entire restaurant  you rock!< /text>

I should have taken a picture. My friend took me here for dinner a few days ago. I've been here for brunch many times but never for dinner. I had the small Sashimi salad. It was so beautiful I was hesitant to touch it with a fork or chopsticks. It was also almost too much for me to eat. Needless to say, but I shall, it was wonderful and the miso dressing was surprisingly perfect. I find so many restaurants wash out the Miso so I can hardly taste it. I will definitely return to have that salad again.</review>

Service was great in spite of the fact that they were understaffed. We forget sometimes how challenging covid has been for restaurant owners and their staff. Sea Fresh has lovely outdoor seating with plentyofspacebetweencustomers. 'm grateful they're open so some of us may have Birthday lunches and other special occasion celebrations.< /text>

Visited Ojai this afternoon and enjoyed a lovely lunch at Sea Fresh.  Loved my ahi sandwich!

Plenty of outdoor dining here, masks required until your at your table.<//Review>

I appreciate your input about posting the sushi hours on our platforms, and I will do that.  But just close our doors?  A bit harsh.  Clearly you have no idea how hard it has been for small businesses.  We have over 40 employees, so for them we just keep trying.\nFYI - I have changed our hours on Google to the new 8:30 PM closing, at least 5 times,  and magically they change back to the 9 PM closing.  I was just changing them again and saw your review.  So wish me luck on changing the Sushi Hours.\nAgain thanks for your input.'}< /resp><review>...apparantly sushi is available but during select hours. Why advertise that you offer sushi at all? Perhaps this should be noted somewhere on your website, on the menu, on ANY online platform really.

Twice I have talked myself out of trying this place, today was my third and final time.

I ended up spending $200 on our meal at Ojai brewing Company and it was so worth it.

Just close your doors. PLEASE.< /review><rating>1< /rating><pics>None<//pics></record>

Absolutely delicious!! I had their ahi tuna poke bowl and it was so good, the tuna tasted so fresh. Definitely one of my new go-to seafood places. They have always had outdoor dining so the place is very accommodating for COVID-19 restrictions<//review>

First time there.  It was around 2 and service was scarce.  Took 45 minutes to get our food and after I had to go up to the server and asked why it was taking so long.  She then brought out our food .  The meal was like warm like it had been sitting there for a bit.  I had ordered an appetizer which came after the meal. I would have ordered another glass of wine but she never came back to see if we needed anything else.i wont put anyone on the spot but just a good idea, when u work as a server within a few minutes after serving the entree check back and see if everything is okay. I had to go find her and ask for our check.  She did take the appetizer off the check.. just check on ur people .< /review>

The pricey scallops were not well seared, a bit flavorless and chewy. The ciopinno had a lot of fish but the broth had an odd flavor that was not enjoyed.<//Review>< Pics>

We enjoy going out. Yesterday we went to this magnificent place which friends told us about. We spent a beautiful time there with very good dishes and a well-trained stuff and  a professional cook. We put this fine restaurant in our list  and we will no doubt go again very soon.  Highly recommended.</Text>

<time>1602138066536<//time><review>It was just ok. Wait staff was solid and on it. The food was ok. I always judge a seafood place on the clam chowder. This chowder was loaded with potatoes (gasp) and hardly any clam. After that everything else that came out was as expected. Side dish was only partially heated, the Fish was bland and flavorless but cooked well, just no flavor. Bleu cheese dressing had no cheese, salad had more cabbage and carrots then lettuce, Drinks were ok, but for the price I thought I’d be getting a craft cocktail. Service was 4-5 stars, food was a 3. It could have been way better, especially for the price.<//review>< user>

Oyster and mussle appetizers were fresh! My Snow Roll and my wife's fish and chips were great too. Normally, when sushi is an addition to a restaurant's main menu, I'm used to it being subpar, so the quality of this roll was a surpassed expectation. My favorite part of the meal ironically though actually wasn't the food, but this fantastic beer by Figueroa Mountain. If the Mosiac Ale is still on tap when you come, try this beer. It paired well with everything and as a whole, I just love the taste of Mosiac hops with their addition of Amarillo.< /text>

Being an ex pat from the UK, I love my fish & chips and in the last 15 years have tried this dish in many, many restaurants in California.
Each time I have visited Sea Fresh with my wife, I have always been hugely impressed with the food and the service.

I'd like to give a big shout out to our servers - Shelby and Jackie who were very attentive and always did a great job in making our dining experience highly enjoyable.

Looking forward to returning soon.</text>< pictures>

<text>Very nice seafood restaurant with excellently prepared food at reasonable prices.  Inside and outside seating with limited free parking in a lot as well as free street parking.  Attentive service.  I enjoy the fish tacos and the clam chowder.  My brother particularly likes the fish and chips.  There is a fresh fish market on site.< /text><Name>Jeff LaBarre</Name>< Response>

All seafood all ways. Sushi is good. Oysters are great. Chowder has unique flavor with lots of clams. Tacos are great, especially the mango mahi.</text>

This place has pretty good food but.. the service... like come on people. We just want to order food. It's been like this forever. They take your drink order and lag for a little. then take your appetizer order and don't bother coming back for your order until you get your appetizer(if you order one). We got up and walked out cause we waited 50 min to order. That's how it is everytime and they say its cause they're understaffed but they aren't... just lazy. If you want a 3 hour dinner come here but if not don't bother.< /Review>

The wait was short, only a few minutes and this was at peak time. The staff was nice. Food was decent quality for the price. My only complaint would be the time it took for everything, for our server to first see us, the time to bring drinks and the time to bring the food, it was all really long.</Review>

I heard this was the best place for seafood in the city so we tried it. I guess my expectations were a bit biased because of the claim, but that's my mistake. For a small town, I think the food is ok.</text>

The seafood at this restaurant is awesome. So fresh hence the name. Service is on spot and they also have excellent sushi. There happy hour is excellent. The prices are great for the quality of fresh fish and the drinks are a great bargain as well. Check them out if you want a nice time and great food.< /review>

We came in Sunday March 17, 2019; late afternoon. Food was amazing. I had the alfredo angel sea food pasta. Loved it loved it. I would have given 5 stars but service was very very slow. We were seated and we waited for our waiter, who did not bring water, for about 15 minutes. She did not even introduce herself or apologize for the wait. Made me a little upset that people kept coming and getting seated and here we are still waiting for at least water. I really hope this was a once in blue moon thing because i really enjoyed  the food.< /text>

I've had wonderful meals here, but last night was not one of them. The Wasabi crusted Ahi was overcooked and both vegetable dishes were so undercooked that we could not get a knife through them. Not sure what happened there. The Bloody Mary was good!<//review>

<Review>We have been going here ever since they opened, 30+ years ago. This is the go to spot on Ojai. Every time my family comes home to visit we always end up here. We have celebrated many special occasions here and love to come anytime. The breakfast is great too!
We have always been partial to Seafresh, not just because we have known the Sutton's for so long, but because they have their own boats and do their own fishing. That's some mighty fresh fish that makes up the bulk of their menu. By the way, you have to try the sushi 🍣 They have so many delicious rolls and it's inevitable that you will smell the amazing aroma of garlic when they serve up "Chris's famous Garlic Tuna roll". So yummy!  For me, I love that I can still order veggie based meals too.
This is an Ojai favorite for locals and travelers alike. There is a reason that they have been able to have such longevity in the restaurant business... It's because they know what they are doing. If you find yourself in the Channel Islands Harbor, you have to go check out their restaurant on the water. Great location and totally different vibe.
Keep up the amazing work my friends. We will continue to support you.< /Review></record>

Just got into town and we were hungry. Walked by lots of places and then decided to stop here. Ordered the clam chowder bread bowl, fried oysters and seafood co salad. Everything was fresh and tasted quite good. We sat on the patio outside and it was perfect in the 90 degree second coming of summer here in Southern California. They also have a seafood market with quite a few choices as well.</Review>

A great spot for some seafood in town, with a variety to choose from on the menu.  There is also a section off the back entry area where you can buy seafood to take home yourself to cook. I love coming here with my friends for lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly, the ambiance is low-key and pricing is reasonable. I also enjoy their mixed drinks.<//Text>

I agree it was better at one time.
Clam chowder is mostly potato’s.
No clam flavor at all.
We asked for some pan fried scallops since they do make a pasta dish with scallops. That was flatly declined and when we got what they dictated...the scallops were like rubber, way over cooked.
Fried clams were also like trying to eat oily rubber bands
The costs were way high for what we received.
Well drinks are small and pricey too.
The patio heater was broken.
Etc, etc.</Text>

Everything was perfect. The happy hours portions were massive and very tasty. The owner actually brought a customer a lap blanket because she was cold. Now this is Ojai service at its finest. KUDOS.< /Review>

I enjoy the food. Their menu has a wide variety sure to please everyone whether you like sushi, fish and chips, pasta  or catch of the day.
My only complaint is that it's noisy.
If you sit inside at least there is climate control (air conditioned for summer and heat in winter) but sitting outside downright unpleasant not only  from all the traffic noise but the exhaust fumes as well. We showed up last Easter for lunch without a reservation and when we asked to sit inside the hostess was almost indignant that we would even ASK for such a privilege without a reservation and seated us as close to the road as possible<//Review>

Keep trying. We use to love Sea Fresh but there food has gone downhill. Husband had oysters Rockefeller but only ate half because he said they were not very good. I had tuna on fire and the tuna was cooked all the way through. It is meant to be seared. Nice patio. Service o.k. but not great. Had breakfast there and it was good but dinner I would go somewhere else for the money. Sad we use to go there once a week.< /Review>

<Review>Went there for a quick bite to eat with parents.   Boy were we  greeted by a  warm & friendly staff.  Not only impressed withe service, but the menu plates we ordered wasn't over salted, greasy, burned, and was very delicious even to my father who's also a diabetic.  There's a belief in our family:"You can tell if the food is great, because no one was talking, so the food must be right. We brought more of our family members back there to dine...and again Not one word when our food was brought to us.   A W E S O M E ! ! "</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< review>
I have spent milestone Birthdays at Seafresh so I thought since it was my 40 something's bday I would go I joked with the owner Gus about a free bday drink no intention of actually accepting more just wanting people to acknowledge my day I had the money in my hand enough for a few drinks, but to my dismay The owner very rudely scoffed at me and said "we don't do that here" a litte hurt and completely embarassed I took it further trying to get him to see that I was kidding so I poked funand said what about a price cut laughing as i said it he very disgustedly said " uhhuh no" and i said well what about happy hour then even more sickened looking not looking me in the eyes actually rolling he said" Monday thru friday 2-6" this happened on a Satuday approximately 4 pm. At this point he never once looked me in the eyes never said happy bday have a nice day nothing that's what I guess I wanted like I said I wouldve declined any price cuts if offered but he was shockingly unnerved by me. It was humiliating the bartender was so taken aback that she hadn't even started making me my drink she looked like maybe I would tell him off or he would kick me out but I laughed it off and she slowly started making my drink wished me a happy birthday which Gus still didn't get that that's all I really wanted and she and I started talking and she was glad to see I didn't flip out and leave another waitress saw how badly I was treated and went and sat with my mom as I drank my first drink at the bar then ordered a beer for the table she even said shocked looking "you're staying and you want to order a beer oh good" so I think she thought that the way he treated me should've been brought to his attention and by some reviews on different sites although they are doing very well I am séeing a huge popularity decline for there policies and slow service bad customer service over priced food and drinks for non garnished undesirable looking but still good food although he did end up even ruining the food that day because I have a nervous condition generalized anxiety disorder and I was so upset that when I got home my hair was drenched in sweat and I used the restroom more than once with my guts hurting and cramping now I don't think it was the food but the service the way I was treated is what made me sick. There is a policy that if your not sitting at the bar for happy hour the drink specials don't apply to you so even though they have a dog freindly open area outside if you have a dog and just go for drink specials because your not at the bar you cannot get the discount many people have stopped going because of this policy so basically only 4-5 people that choose or can sit at the bar cause thats the only room they have they are not really giving anyone a happy hour cause the bar area is too small and no one else is eligable and they told me one time that they wer going to add the dollar back on my bill if I walked my drink out of the bar area to go sit with my family and had the nerve to ask why do you want to go over there anyways i said because im here with my mom and dad and we are still going to order lunch I just wanted to get a beer first they said well if you take your drink to the rable its going to be full price even though I drank halgh of it at the bar and already paid for it they were going to put the dollar on my parents bill so I downed the rest like a teenager at a kegger and put it down and went about lunch with my family there customer service sucks and now I know why Gus is a really tightly wound guy that doesn't respect the customers so neither does the staff so last bday anyone in my immediate family will be spending there and I know that wont make any difference in there business but if enough people get treated this poorly his business will suffer I for one will not feel bad about that......</review>

This amazing establishment when confronted with my unreasonable group requests handled us with Grace and kindness. The staff is truly professional an exceptionally tolerant of special needs situations. The dining room food is delectable and happy hour becomes a joyous respite with close friends.

Food was good but service left a lot to be desired. Once ordered which took a while food was delivered and never saw the server again drinks went unfilled and once done took flagging someone down in order to get the check and they weren't very busy.</Review>

The patio at this place is absolutely gorgeous and huge!

The food was all very delicious, albeit overpriced. My biggest gripe would be the laughable slices of sashimi, which were the thinnest I’ve even seen. I’d never even really thought about the thickness of my sashimi until I ate here! 😂
The only other thing I’d add on is that the drinks are very reasonably priced, almost cheap, but it did take quite a few of them to get the job done.< /Text>

It was ok. I used to wait tables and do not typically send any food back but the waitress took the wrong order(nice lady bless her heart just not her gig) then I had to send back a cocktail and shrimp cocktail cocktail was not good and shrimp was gummy and the presentation was a cup of them in melted water and a blob of cocktail sauce on top. For the price point it was not impressive. They may want to simplify the menu to what they are good at.<//review>

Well I just finished up my first experience here & unfortunately it will probably be my last. It was slow when I arrived but so was my lack of reception & service. The food was good but not excellent. While I had enough to eat I still somehow felt cheated. The worst part of my experience was watching food being delivered as servers ate. I know we all get hungary but how can it possibly be correct to still be inserting & chewing your food while taking someone else theirs?<//review>

I'm not a huge seafood person, so when I'm going against my will with friends to such a restaurant, I hope under my breath that I can tolerate something. 5 stars for Sea Fresh, since they were able to exceed my expectations and I was able to enjoy great seafood.< /Text>

Decent food but even as locals the service is terribly hit n miss. Just tonight, they werent even busy, my mother and sat down and after 15minutes of waiting for a server to look our way to place a drink order we left.  Highly recommend the new place in town Sakura Ojai, much better service.< /Review>

<rating>4<//rating><Name>Brian Smith</Name><review>We've been here twice, and the food was very good both times. The cioppino was amazing! However, the service can be slow, and the second time our server spent a LOT of time with the big table of six next to us and neglected us to the point where I had to remind him to bring water, etc. I ordered a second drink and it never arrived. The staff needs work, but overall it is worth a little frustration.< /review>< user>

You get what you pay for here.  The chicken piccata tastes fresh and NOT frozen.  My food was hot, and the sauce was made as I would expect a piccata.< /Text>

Except the poke, enjoyed that.  Buttom line,  I should have made mac and cheese from the beginning. Would have saved time and a lot of money. As a single mom, just want a break from cooking and treat the family with a nice seafood meal. Jokes on me. Never again!</review>< Pictures>

Food was so - so.  Service was not good.  Our waitress finally appeared after 10 minutes and they weren't busy.  To get the check I finally had to get up and find her.  She never checked back to make sure we were okay.  A bus boy kept the water glasses filled.  They didn't seem to have sections for the waiters and waitresses.  People coming seated after us with other waiters were served long before we were.<//Text>
