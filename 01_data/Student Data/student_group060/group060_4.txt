<rate>5</rate><Text>Very nice and clean space, I felt safe visiting as all equipment is thoroughly sanitized. I have very sensitive gums, it runs in the family. Deep cleaning procedures are usually very painful for me, Dr. Miller was gentle and carefully performed the cleaning and I barely cried this time! Happy with my experience, will come back for more.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Miller and his team were incredibly warm and accommodating, they made me feel comfortable and were very helpful. Especially as someone who has always been kind of scared of dentists, Dr. Miller did a great job of assuaging my fears, and was gentle and thorough. Thanks!<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Miller and the staff were very welcoming, helpful, and kind. I’ve been going here for a while and the practice is beautiful, modern, and clean. I used to be so nervous going to the dentist but Dr. Miller was very gentle and the work is outstanding. Even the front office helped sort out insurance issues for me. If you are in need of a dentist or any work, I highly recommend this office and Dr. Miller.< /Text>< Time>

First class modern equipment and technics provided.  I needed a crown and they scanned my teeth and had a 3D printed crown made.  While waiting for the crown to come in my temporary crown came loose.  It is very rare to have one come loose; however the office responded to my message within a few hours and arranged to have a employee meet me at the office.  This was on a Sunday on Memorial day weekend.  This is a testament  to their dedication to their patients.  The lady who showed up was apologetic about my situation and was friendly and professional even with the fact she had to come in on a holiday weekend.  She quickly made some adjustments to my temporary crown and securely placed it back on the tooth.  This is truly  a dental office that puts their patients needs first.< /review>

<text>I had such an amazing experience at Ivory Pointe. From the first phone call with Teresa who is amazing and guided me through all my insurance documents. Dr Miller was really attentive and addressed my issues without trying to sell me a whole lot of services I don’t need. I’m so happy to have my dentist in Vista and highly recommend Dr Miller and his team.<//text>< Pictures>

Thanks especially to Kyla for the care and attention, you made me feel so at ease especially as I am a nervous patient. I had an implant placed in my upper molar and Dr Miller took out my tooth and put the implant in at the same time- absolutely amazing. I had no pain and swelling and will be getting my new tooth soon. Thanks Ivory Pointe Dentistry and Dr Miller for restoring my faith in my dentist.<//Review></record>

<Review>Just like anyone else, I’m not a big fan of visiting the dentist but, Dr. Miller and his staff have made all my visits exceptionally pleasant. The entire crew is friendly and upbeat despite how busy they always are. Nothing ever feels rushed and I respect their need for perfection.
This location is new for them, equipment is all new and high tech. Lots of extra sanitation precautions due to Covid are taken before you even come through their door. I never felt anything less than comfortable being there.
Most insurance is taken and they do try to work with you on payment plans. I wouldn’t have been able to get all the required work I needed without their assistance and generous payment options.
I highly recommend giving this place a try if you’re normally less than excited to visit a dentist.</Review>< pics>

I never thought I could be happy with another Dentist after Dr Witmer left.  I had been with him over 25 years.   ... I was so resistant.

But I am thrilled to say Dr  Miller is wonderful!!  He’s kind and attentive... very very good at his work.  I’ve been seeing him for over a year now.    I have gotten implants and crowns and regular work.    Thank you Dr Miller so much !!

The office staff are so great too.  Especially Sue and Carmen.  They are the best ❤️

I highly recommend Ivory Point Dentistry 🏆👍🏼</text>

Felt like I was at a used car lot with a high pressure salesman. I stated on my call and several times I had been to a specialist and did not want implants just extract the tooth. My reasoning was financial for the most part my second reason was life expectancy which in my case is not good the dentist or staff never asked why my life expectancy was low. I listened to there quote and it was more than a $1,000 more than a specialist had quoted. I said I would like an appointment for extraction after some hassle the office staff made the appointment only to call me later and say the dentist won't do just the extraction and they were cancelling my appointment.<//Text>

<Review>I had a chipped front tooth that I went and had fixed at another dental office. I was very unhappy with the way it looked and it chipped again.

I made an appt at Ivory Pointe Dentistry after searching for cosmetic dentistry in my area on google.

I am so so happy with what Dr. Miller did for my front tooth!  I now have my confidence back to smile and show my teeth!  I highly recommend Ivory Pointe Dentistry and Dr. Yaron Miller! 😁</Review></record></dataset><record>

I first came to this office by chance, and while many of my on a whim decisions end in regret, I am happy to say this one did not. They have exceeded my expectations at every appointment!  Dr. Miller’s bedside manner is as exceptional as his technical skills. Never before have I had such easy experiences at a dental office. His staff is both knowledgeable and friendly, from the front of the office to the back. Giuliana helped me on my visit a week ago. Her upbeat, positive attitude put me at ease when discussing my implant that was to be put in the following week. I have to say, I was initially disappointed when Kyla greeted me on the day of my implant procedure, I had been hoping it would again be Giuliana.  I saw right away, though, that Kyla had the same ability to calm me when I began to panic (I’m a bit of a baby). She was so kind and knowledgeable!  How Dr. Miller has found such amazing people to fill his office I will never know.  I have read some comments that say he is not cheap, and yes, I would agree. I am a bargain shopper as much as the next person, but for me I will save my deal hunting for handbags and clothes, not permanent dental work!  As they say... you get what you pay for!  Thank you, Dr. Miller, for your expertise!<//Review>

So I have been in San Diego county since 2004. My old dentist in Colorado made dental care something I didn’t even have to think about. Very high standards. Since I moved here I have been to 6-7 different dentist and have had TERRIBLE experiences at all of them. No scruples, no compassion or empathy. No willingness to have actual conversations or the ability to work out a plan or options. The worst part besides the rudeness is they all seemed to think I had a garage full of Ferraris. I have good insurance yet they ALL wanted to charge way more than my insurance allowed. They also would do the consultation thing with a $10,000.00 estimate. Some wouldn’t even contact my insurance to see what they would pay, would just give me a crazy high estimate with no insurance participation.
Then I found Ivory Point.
After one phone call I felt like this was the place. Theresa is amazing not only at making you feel welcome but immediately generated a “trust factor”.
The office is state of the art and high tech yet inviting. The initial consultation began with Kyla. Very nice and professional. The I met Dr Miller. I could just tell he was way different than any other dentist I’ve met in California. I explained my situation to him and he eagerly had a game plan to fix my mouthful of bad teeth according to what I could afford. Since my insurance allotment expires Dec 31, I wanted to get as much done this year as possible. This morning Theresa called me (WOW) to fit me in. Then Michelle the hygienist did an absolutely amazing job. These folks won’t allow pain, suffering or discomfort at all. After I was done she was great with tips and advise etc...
On my way out I stuck a conversation with Theresa again and before I knew it I was scheduled back in again today. They were busy when I came back yet none failed to offer apologies for the wait and true caring for their patient. Again with Kyla and Dr. Miller. Within an hour I am half way done on my road to recovery.
I expressed much appreciation to all and told them how good they really are. Dr Miller has amazing skills in his profession but beyond that he has really earned my respect and that of his amazing team as well. My experience here gives me faith again at how professionally and compassionately a business can be operated. They will have my business as well as anyone I can refer to them forever!!!!
SO IMPRESSED

Beth did an excellent job, cleaning my teeth and explaining in detail proper hygiene. She was genuinely nice and heart felt in remembering my adult son whom is also her patient! Julianna was very energetic and positive and took a quite of time making me feel comfortable understanding the dental implant process. Feels good to finally take care of myself especially with this team of professionals!!!< /text>

<Review>Staff is incredibly nice and so was Dr. Miller, DDS!

A very nice experience and the facility was impressively clean, neat and organized.  I am also highly impressed at the technology they provide for X-rays and photos.  I’m a happy patient and feel I have found a wonderful practice for all dental needs.  😊<//Review><date>1603838548135<//date>< Pics>

< Review>
Before Dr. Miller a visit to the dentist was a daunting experience ... filled with apprehension. Seven years ago I found Dr. Yaron Miller and now I can finally completely relax knowing I am truly in competent hands and a caring environment. Dr. Miller always finds the time to explain a procedure and makes me feel totally at ease in his care.  His new facility Ivory Pointe is state of the art  with the latest dental technology and a super friendly staff.  Now I look forward to my dental appointments not to mention the confidence I have in my new sparkling smile!</Review>

<Time>1617967962443<//Time><resp>None<//resp><Text>Dr Miller and staff have provided necessary procedures to correct some old dental issues that I let go due to the pandemic and a caregiver of mother.  I had significant decay in a cracked off molar as well as decay as a result of a bad veneer job on a chipped tooth 25 years ago.  The surgery was very successful and extractions and a rebuild with implant performed in an efficient painless matter for me. I am very protective of my health.  I do take care of my teeth but by missing four years of routine visits as well as cracking molar from stress apparently in my sleep. Dr Miller is highly skilled and has expertise which was displayed to me and convinced me through education to understand my needs.  3 days out and I am doing great.  Looking forward to completing the healing period and installing the two new chompers in four months.  With any surgery there is risk of infection however those risks were eliminated by staff and I was prescribed gold standard prophylactically and feel confident of a good healing.  I have over 30 years in the healthcare industry working with 1000s of healthcare personnel and am pleassed to say the office is excellent all around.  So if you have an issue know they can help and dont be afraid (Covid) all processes and procedures were performed well and that also outs my mind at ease.  Its a serious issue, dental disease, and cannot be ignored.  We now know there is strong correlation with dementia and poor oral health.  So take care of your teeth.  If you dont, costs will be higher if you wait.</Text>< pics>

I have never thought i was ever waiting too long to be seen. I have had some really awful dentists in the past so I'm hanging on to this one! He fixed a very poorly done implant. He actually had to start over. It has been trouble free since. Love this dentist and staff, cant recommend them enough.< /review></record>

Outstanding services and the most customer oriented, friendly staff I have ever encountered.  Dr. B (Hannah) is the most knowledgeable, caring dentist I have ever encountered.  She always is concerned about your comfort and welfare and her knowledge and professionalism is amazing!  Job well done Hannah - off to Hollywood now😊.  Sue, her assistant is awesome, knows her job extremely well and always puts the patient first.  She has ALWAYS been the greatest dental assistant I have ever encountered.  Theresa and Carmen at the front desk are always helpful and considerate.  Theresa worked wonders with my insurance company to ensure they covered al much as they could!  I now have a complete set of crowns (top and bottom) that feel great, work outstanding and look amazing — at an amazing cheaper price than implants would ever cost.  The whole office (and I know I probably forgot a few folks) made the difference - I wouldn’t hesitate one second to go back to get anything else done from cleaning to implants.  “Bravo Zulu” to Ivory Point Dentistry ( BTW - if you are unfamiliar with “Bravo Zulu” ask  Theresa when you go in😊.< /review>

Anybody that needs dentistry, please i beg of you!! Go to Ivory Point in Vista. I give them A+ on every aspects of dentustry. In my 71 years of life, Dr. Yaron Miller, is by far the best of the best. Especially now with covid, he us the cleanest, most disinfected place ever. I felt safe and secure. He also does the best dental work ever. His dental Hygienist is the best ever. I am very picky, and i love this place. Trust me you will never go anywhere else, once you try Dr. Yaron Miller. His cosmetic dentistry is superb. The best.<//review>

I have been a patient of Dr Miller for 10 years and can only rave about him and the practice. The new office is beautifully remodeled but the amazingly helpful and friendly staff have remained the same. I had a dental implant placed yesterday with a sinus lift and the whole process was fast and painless. I was so surprised as I was expecting it to be painful. Dr Miller is so skilled at what he does and kept me constantly at ease. Thanks again to everyone at Ivory Pointe Dentistry.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Miller and his staff are the nicest and most professional hands down. They don't make you feel uncomfortable or invaluable. I had two crowns being put on and one was not fitting. Dr. Miller knew that I was leaving the state and didn't have the opportunity to come back. He made sure that all my dental needs were met. I hope I can find a dentist like this in my new state!< /review>< gmapID>

I am a return patient of Dr. Miller. Recently was in for a deep cleaning with the hygienist. First of all, the remodeled office is immaculate, beautiful and comfortable. The separate hygienist area was grand.
I felt well taken care of, was given full explanation of what I’m doing wrong and how to correct it, was not pushed into additional services & Michelle and Michelle was isuperb. TY Ivory Point</Text>

<text>My family and I have been going to Ivory Pointe Dentistry for over 20 years now and I always appreciate the warm, friendy, and professionalism of all the staff from the front desk people to all those that work directly with the Dentists along with every Dentist in this practice. One big difference with Ivory Pointe compared to other Dental offices I have gone to in the past is the fact they do not push or pressure you on other services and inflate your costs. They only show thoroughly on your xrays what truely is needed to keep your teeth and gums healthy. They have just recently finished the remodel of the entire building and changed all the landscaping that has made this a crown jewel in this area. They have also up graded all the equipment and machines to the latest and most advanced technology, They take the current situation with COVID-19 very seriously with taking your temperature at the front desk and filling out a COVID-19 questionnaire at every visit. They have a special HVAC air purifier system to take out any harmful impurities floating in the air and also follow the strict CDC guidelines to keep their employees and us patients safe. I strongly recommend Ivory Pointe Dentistry.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I needed quite a bit of dental work done that I'd been putting off after some bad experiences, I did a lot of research on local dental practices near me that accepted my insurance and I wound up at Ivory Pointe.
From the get go - discussing my treatment plan with Teresa was like chatting with an old friend. She makes you feel so comfortable and takes a lot of the anxiety out of the numbers you're looking at.
Dr. Miller is more professional than personable, but he is very knowledgeable.
Dr. Belhorn was astounding. She did some fillings on me and was so accommodating, informative and really took her time to make me feel comfortable. You can really tell she's passionate about what she does. She even made sure I was alright with all the work I was getting done in such a short period of time.
Carmen is always so welcoming and creates a great atmosphere.
Everyone I've had the pleasure of working with here is fantastic. I wish I could remember everyone else's names to make sure they're in the spotlight too- but the staff in its entirety is phenomenal.

I've had a lot of work done in just a few short weeks and even though dental work can be very expensive and nerve-wracking, I'm very pleased with the experience I've had here.< /Text>

I’m injured and very afraid of these people. They mishandled and manhandled me and I have pictures to prove it. They tried to do the same X-rays again until I flat out refused then was told “oh yeah, we already have them.” Very unprofessional. They knew I had a narrow mouth but attempted to use equipment that didn’t fit and hurt me trying to force it. Then they used some other device that didn’t protect my lips from the bleach and I got a severe burn on my lip, not my gums like they kept saying is normal. I have a very clear and painful blister. Why didn’t they just wait until they had the proper equipment? Why trying to take unnecessary xrays? Why did I have to hear clearly every single word from the other exam rooms? Where’s the privacy? No HIPPA in Dentistry? I’m appalled, I’m infuriated, I’m injured and they have my money.<//Text>

< Review>
The team at Ivory Pointe Dentistry is the best! I thought there might be a problem with my temporary crown that was put on two days ago, so I thought I'd drop in first thing this morning (Friday) to try to have someone take a look at it to make sure all was ok. The door was locked at 8am so I knocked, and Teresa opened it. I told her my situation and she said that the office is only open Fridays for Admin, but she let me come in and she called Sue to see if she could come help me out. And she did! She happily came in on her day off to make sure I was good...and she had a smile on her face the whole time. Both Teresa and Sue went above and beyond to help me out and I truly appreciate the awesome "customer service"! This is the best dental office I've ever been involved with....thank you Ivory Pointe!<//Review>

<text>NO PAIN!  I’ve hated the dentist since I was a kid (60 years). I no longer hate one dentist, Dr. Miller. He was very caring and explained everything.

Now Julie is another story. She is Great and makes Dr. Miller look good.

I will return often</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc769c563c99ab:0x8cd98cb7fa13b992< /Gmap_id></record>

Very helpful knowledgeable people and willing to help you find the correct items and show you them not very many places do that service anymore . In other places they just point here they take you to what your looking for and make other suggestions and that was an awesome experience< /text>

Absolutely love coming here for vitamins, to pre-work out and protein shakes and also to skin care and hair products! They have a large selection of products at good prices along with great customer service. They help guide you to find what your looking for with patience and knowledge of the product. Definitely recommend coming here!</Text>

CALLING OUT THE MANAGER....I had the worst experiences in my entire life visiting this location yesterday 6/30/2017, between 3:45 pm and 4:07 pm. This is the only Vitamin Shoppe I shop at and refer people to. I was charged $103.18 by a rude Black female employee. Never once did she offer me or my wife help, she walked around giving us the cold shoulder and would look at us with this constipated look on her face. At one point while looking at the magnesium, she even went out here way to dust the shelve behind me, dropping all the dust on my legs and shoes! When I pointed it out to her, she said "oh, I'm just try to get things cleaned so I can get out of here." I'm calling out the managers to pull the stores cameras and review that women's behavior, to see that I am not just some angry guy trying to get something out of this and to mainly PROTECT customers from employees like her. On my receipt her "employee" number: 020621<//review>

Great fun for ten bucks! Came here with the boys and we had a lot of fun playing nerf. Felt like we burned a decent number of calories and the games that the staff moderated were fun<//Review>

A nice place for a nerf gun battle. A nice size for larger parties but the obstacles in their play area is a bit sparse. You have 75 minutes of play which has a good amount of time but it's mostly free play. There was one game between teams with scoring and that was really fun. A bit more "organized" play would have been nice but the kids didn't seem to mind.

Although you can upgrade the party for $4/child so they can try out a larger variety of guns I would recommend you stay basic. The larger guns tend to jam more and take longer to load.

You can bring in water and a fruit plate platter but food and drinks for a party needs to be ordered thru the venue.</Review>

Kids had a great time, their only complaint was they wished they didnt have to play by the house rules. They broke them down into teams. Kids preferred to play against each other. Everyone against everyone. No teams. But overall kids had a great time<//Text>

<Text>This place rocks! The staff was so nice they handled everything from start to finish. Even went outside and grabbed a case of water from our car so that we would not miss out on the fun with the kids. The way they set it up is great free play for the majority of the time then they have two set up games, team death match and capture the flag. The kids loved it and can't wait for the next party there.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dd33b2f1c1179b:0xf434fa11fb07f031</gmapID></record>

Tag and Target was a great birthday party experience for my son's group of friends.  They have a great open setup for the kids to play various NERF games.  The staff was friendly and was able to organize a bunch of 5-6 year olds.< /review>

<text>Great for kids that want to blow off some steam and shoot each other with Nerf guns. There are games that are played like capture the flag and others as well. If you do the party pack, you can shoot and play different games led by an instructor for 75 minutes. There is an eating area for 24 people after games are played, you bring your party food/drink/cake.< /text>< Rate>

The variety they had was amazing, and the fun of shooting was great! You're more likely to spend most of the time reloading, but a game of target was fun and tiring.<//review>

Jenny is the best, request her for your kids haircut. You will not regret it. I totally recommend. I've been coming here for approximately 2 yrs now. My son enjoys the race car seats and the little play area while we wait. There's even a small gift for the kids at the end of there haircut!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Unfortunately we won't be back, the staff is wonderful but the cost is not (19 bucks before tip, or 20 if I use my card). How am I supposed to tip your staff appropriately when my kid's college fund just paid for one visit? This is Whittier not Bel-Air.<//Review>< pictures>

Took my 11 month old son to get his 1st haircut. Nelly cut his hair. She was so patient & my son was being fussy. She did such an awesome job. Haircut was exactly what I had wanted. I loved our experience there. He received a certificate for his first haircut & a lock of hair. So happy. We will be coming back!< /review>

Really depends on which stylist you get. From my experiences, the younger ladies care/pay attention a tad more attention to details.<//text>

GREAT GREAT GREAT!!! I LOVE it here!!!
I took my daughter here for the first time this week, for her first haircut. They cater to chilsren specifically, but also provide adult services as well! They have been guests at the Nickelodeon kids choice awards for being recognized for their skills! They have a lot for the little ones to do while you wait, t.v.'s at each station, car chairs, and regular chairs, toys, and their own line of hair care products. I like that they offer the different options for services. They have single services, or packages to choose from. They have Good prices and their workers do quality work! My daughters haircut and style came out great! She made sure to make my daughter feel extra special too, and gave her a bow to keep for her hair, and sprinkled pink glitter in her hair as well! Highly recommend! And they only accept walk-ins, so show up early!< /Text>

I'm sorry but they really don't know how to cut hair. The only reason why I bring my 3 year old here, is because he won't cut his hair anywhere else. He likes the fact that he gets to sit in a lightning McQueen Car while getting his haircut.< /Text>

<review>Oh no honey! After today I won’t return! And I’ve been taking my toddler there since his 1st haircut !

Young mom stylist “Lupita” is her name she also  had her 2 minor daughters in the work area that looked from the ages 5-8 years old....she had the oldest vacuum the buggy for her next client ! CHILD LABOR LAW Lupita!

She pissed me off because after the cut my toddler went to get his toy...he grabbed a cheapy figure that was probably 10 cents worth  then he grabbed 4 more only because he liked the colors so I was looking for a lil ball that lights that the owner usually has ...when the hairdresser yelled out “YOU CAN ONLY TAKE 1!”

I said oh hell NO! she is not yelling out in front of the 3 other clients waiting to be attended ...mind you I was already correcting my toddler and looking for that ball that lit ....she didn’t need to cause a scene ! So already PISSED off! I just offered to pay for the 4 of 5 figures that my baby got JUST to get out of there! I was dealing with my toddler didn’t want to deal with Lupita...

She freakn charged me $1 for each of the extra figures! So I ended up paying $4 extra on top of the $19 for the hair cut which was an abuse !!

I said never again! As it is the haircut is terribly over priced and the establishment doesn’t even have air conditioning why be so petty!

I can go elsewhere for a lot less my baby doesn’t need toys he just likes going there to play and for the gesture if the free toy which helped me taking him to get his haircut even though it’s hot and stuffy there but I rather go elsewhere.

OWNER, educate your employee and go over the child labor law with her.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1511811742362, 'text': 'Hello Maria, our regular haircut price of $18.95 is posted all over our reception.  We understand our prices are not for everyone.  If you thought the price was an "abuse", why did you still requested us to cut your toddler\'s hair?  As a suggestion for next time you get any type of service anywhere else and in order to avoid any misunderstandings, you should make sure what the price is to see if it is within your budget, otherwise it looks like you were coming in for a free haircut.'}</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d3d1346178f7:0x73bc10981bb5e302< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very upset. My nephew goes to get his cut there. He cries during the haircut which I get is difficult to cut a crying kids hair but it’s a hair salon for children. I would expect they accommodate crying kids a little better. They even felt the need to ask for him not to return. How can they deny a child at a children’s salon. I would also like to add that they didn’t do the best job on his hair cut and the salon OVER charged five more dollars than the actual hair cut. He came home really upset after his hair cut, sad a three year old can tell when someone is giving him a negative vibe.</Text>< Pictures>

I would definitely recommend this place! It was my first time here and I will definitely be coming back! The place is clean, beautiful, and relaxing! Selena is great, made me feel very comfortable. I got the half and half(sugar and wax) I never had wax before, everything was painless, I was very impressed!< /text>

<review>This was the most pleasant and amazing hair removal process I have ever gone through! I booked my appointment while abroad and it was definitely worth the trouble to connect to them!

Scheduling: Scheduling was super easy! Schedule online through their website or call ahead.

Service: I scheduled a Brazilian sugaring and full-leg sugaring. The process was NOT painful, especially compared to my previous hair removal processes at other businesses. This time I was seen by Kristyn, but I've also been sugared by Danielle, Mimi, and Jillian. I asked Kristyn about any suggestions for my ingrown hairs and she helped me get rid of as many as her time allowed. She gave me suggestions on exfoliating tactics!

Decor: The center is extremely clean. The rooms were lit and decorated very nicely.

I am so sad I do not live around Claremont but this my go-to spot for whenever I'm back in town. I wish I could give more than 5 stars and will recommend their services to anyone interested in hair removal.< /review>< GmapID>

<UserId.>103797255940690689221< /UserId.><Review>I was terrified to get my first ever body waxing done, a Brazilian no less, but I booked an appointment at the request of a good friend. I couldn't have asked for a better experience, nor have I had one since at any other place. The place and staff are warm and inviting, the workspace is super clean, and I've never felt in better hands for such a vulnerable experience. I highly recommend this place. The only reason I haven't been able to go back is transportation issues, otherwise you wouldn't find me anywhere else.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Since the beginning, Danielle has been amazing at trying to get me an appointment. She took time from her day off to help get in.
I only go to Danielle every two week. I’ve referred family, friends and co workers.
She’s amazing and so great at what she does!< /text>< user_name>

DO NOT get your eyebrows waxed at this location. The aestheticians and the owner at this place were not only very rude to me but left me with a terrible eyebrow job. I had an eyebrow appointment here and the first lady that assisted me did not remove my eyebrows properly. After she applied hard wax, cleaned with sugar wax and then tweezed, the bottom of my eyebrows had a lot of hair to remove and left with a BALD SPOT on the top left eyebrow. When I confronted the lady and requested a second lady, they denied that there was a bald spot and then proceeded to continue to tweeze my eyebrows. After this, I was still unhappy with their work and proceeded to tell them to stop anything they were doing. After much arguing, they offered me a discount for the eyebrows. However, even the owner DANIELLE, after taking a look a my eyebrows denied that she saw a bald spot. I was just so upset I paid the rest of the services I received that day and left. Extremely disappointed to say the least.<//Review>

Awesome place to get pampered and get the perfect eye lash extensions! I needed to get my lashes done and last minute the owner, Danielle, went out of her way after hours and booked an appointment for me! Customer service was exceptional! Sara did my eye lashes hybrid -volume and they came out perfect! Though I spent a little more $ then I normally did, it was so worth every penny! They lasted for 4 weeks! Perfect for our vacation time! Thank you so much! I can’t wait to come back!</Text>

<Review>Love getting my lashes here! I usually ask Danielle each time I need my lashes done for special occasions. She does it so well! With her very friendly personality, I’ll never look elsewhere to get my lashes done. I got just the natural lashes and they lasted me a whole month without retouching! Went to Bali, Indonesia with newly lashes, went swimming, walked under the rain, and with the humidity got my skin sweating my lashes were still intact up to when vacation was over! Mind you, we were there for about 2.5 weeks! So if you go to her, you wont be disappointed. I highly recommend her! ☺️<//Review>< pics>

Danielle has done hybrid lash extensions and two fills for me so far, (I go in every two weeks), and I love them!  She transformed my sparse, stubby lashes into gorgeous, lush lashes that still look natural! Now I don't have to spend time layering on mascara in the morning trying coax my shy lashes out of their shell, so that cuts about 10 minutes off my makeup routine!  My eyes even look good without any makeup on now! The salon is clean, has a peaceful atmosphere, smells yummy, and plays good music too! I highly recommend Danielle, but I'm sure everyone else is wonderful too because of her high standards.</text>

I have been coming to OWC for a good two years or so. I received my first facial from Lauren who was absolutely incredible and I haven’t stopped coming here since. Danielle the owner is absolutely amazing she does it all! The entire OWC team is so talented and extremely caring. I always enjoy coming in and pampering myself from time to time. Also most if not all their products are vegan, clean and cruelty free if i’m not mistaken! Grateful to have found this place. Definitely will continue to keep coming here and looking forward to doing a workshop once Covid is under control.</Text>

This is my go-to spot for lash extensions and facials! Danielle does the best job with my lashes - she is always very attentive, knows the style(s) I like, and makes sure to keep my natural lashes healthy. I always get compliments on my lashes when she does them - and I love that it saves me so much time getting ready in the morning!

I also recently started going for acne facial treatments. Danielle is super gentle (until it's time for extractions!) and really got to know my skin before doing anything too drastic. She has helped me with a lot of adult hormonal acne issues, and also made some recommendations to move to green beauty products. My skin has not been this clear in the last 3 years, and I'm finally comfortable wearing no makeup.

Go in for the love and pampering, and leave with a confidence boost!<//review>

After having a lash lift here at Sugared and Lashed Studio the ambiance was very relaxing and this place is quite beautiful. I had my lash lift and eyebrow wax done and I can't wait to come back. The esthetician gave her best effort to make my eyebrows look amazing. I'm definitely trying sugar wax and eyelash extensions next time!<//text>

To call Danielle at OWC and the other staff amazing is an understatement. I have never gotten a Brazilian or any part sugared. I was extremely nervous to go anywhere especially since I have really sensitive skin but after reading all the great reviews this place had, I gave it a try. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I was kind of nervous and uncomfortable but Danielle rapidly helped me relax and made the process easy and fast. Sure it’s a tad painful but nothing you can’t handle. Also the prices are the best in the area and it’s close to my home. I have become a regular because I wouldn’t trust anyone else. I’m also looking into getting my lashes done but that’s for another time.<//review>

Sugared and Lashed Studio in Claremont is such a nice Spa/Studio.
I was greeted by a lovely woman who offered me tea, water, cookies! My esthetician, Jillian greeted me and walked me back to her room. I had an appointment for just my eyebrows but needed some other sugaring done on my face. Jillian was able to fit in my different needs into one appointment, which saved me another trip. I love my brows they are perfect for my face. The other services were done flawlessly, as well. I'm so happy with the results. Jillian was so gracious and friendly; she made me feel relaxed and comfortable. Everyone I came in contact with from the receptionist to the owner Danielle were so welcoming.< /Text>

<Date>1567185803596<//Date><Text>I have only the best things to say about this place and the staff. I got a Brazilian sugar wax done by Danielle and a facial done by Selina. I grew up in Claremont and never had a great experience with waxing services in the area. I have gotten facials and sugar waxes done at a plethora of different salons throughout Orange County and San Luis Obispo county.Of all the places I have been, Sugared and Lashed offers the highest quality services and staff. My recent facials with Selina have completely cleared my acne and I have gotten so many compliments on my "glowing skin" since I started getting these facials. Danielle's Brazilians are quick and painless but she is so efficient and makes you feel very comfortable. I will never go to a different person for my Brazilian hair removal, she seriously works wonders.</Text>< rating>

<Text>Sugared and Lashed Studio is Claremont's *newest* hidden gem for wellness & beauty. Unlike many small locally owned businesses, the prices are VERY reasonable and the owner, Danielle, is almost always on-site. Additionally, the environment is very welcoming, there are always complimentary fresh organic teas, juices, infusions, cookies, etc. waiting for you when you arrive, and the products used don't contain many of the harsh chemicals used at other studios. The treatments I receive here completely changed my lifestyle and the way I look at myself. I will definitely continue booking treatments at Sugared and Lashed Studio.

Being a natural blonde, I also have the joy of light brown & blonde brows, and lashes with blonde bases and tips... *sigh*... This doesn't exactly make for a stunning bold brow & lush lash effect. Moreover, I don't like wearing a lot of makeup because I have extremely sensitive skin. However, when owner, Danielle, recommended I try a keratin lash lift paired with the henna brow and lash tints, it was a total game changer!

Danielle has been working with my brows, allowing them to grow out fuller than what was typical for me in the past, then with the henna tint she can incorporate all my "little blondies" (which used to just be wishful thinking, but ultimately nuisances) into the natural brow. Once the whole brow is the warm shade of brown I like, Danielle uses hard wax to gently clean and shape them for a full, but polished look. The result? Fuller/thicker brows than I ever thought possible! Plus, without all the extra synthetics and chemicals, I never experience any irritation after treatment. (See henna brow and lash tints + brow hard wax before & after photos below)

While I follow up on my lash henna tinting maintenance just as often as my brow henna tinting (about once every two to four weeks as needed), I *do* have to wait longer in between keratin lash lifts. The lash henna tint Danielle uses for me comes out as the jet black color I look for when I used to wear the occasional mascara. I love how much length is "added" to my lashes just from the henna alone, but when paired with the keratin lash lift (last one done before these photos was 3 months ago) it looks like I'm *wearing* lashes even though they're all mine and all natural. Every morning when I wake up after one of Danielle's keratin lash lifts + henna combos and look in the mirror I think to myself, "So this is what Beyoncé was talking about: 'I woke up like dis; flawless.'" 😂

Needless to say, these treatments from Sugared and Lashed Studio truly cut down on the morning routine, and 100% elevate your inner self confidence. All natural. No makeup required. Grab your deodorant, and walk out the door: flawless. Carpe diem!</Text>< Pictures>

Came here one day to do a personality test. Next thing you know I scored so low on their markers and scored above average IQ. Tried pressuring me to buy a book and paying for one of their courses when I can get a free course elsewhere and not pressured. Stay woke and beware<//text>

Awesome place that runs Scientology churches all over the world, these people dedicated their life to helping others, how much cooler can you get? Scientology can help you study better, understand yourself and others better and pretty much with anything that has to do with life. There is no downside to getting better, after all that's what everyone wants, unless they are an antisocial psychopath. P.S. I looked at a few negative "reviews" and frankly, none of them make any sense --<//text>

<text>The Church of Scientology is doing so much good for the world at a time when the world needs it the most. I am grateful to see the work they are doing to create a sane civilization. I wouldn't listen to hate about Scientology or Scientologists. You can see for yourself the positive changes they are making in the society. These people genuinely want to help, and are one of the few groups who have been (and are) effective in their humanitarian goals.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I Answered a phone call from the church when I lived in LA in 1990(I use the term loosely) and somehow landed on their communication list.  I have moved more than 5 times including out of state and I receive glossy magazines regularly as well as many mailers.  I feel that I need a restraining order.  Each time I have called to politely ask to be removed I am met with little tolerance and no action.   I have many words for an organization such as this but will refrain for now.

What a great exhibit at this building --been through it twice!  The staff are so friendly.  And the history of this building is non-par, what with Charlie Chaplin's office & it's right in the heart of Hollywood.< /text>

<Review>My family and I visited the Church of Scientology International over 2 years ago. Were we greeted with the upmost respect. We were taken on a tour of L.
Ron Hubbard's Life Exhibition (museum so to speak) and I couldn't believe that everything we were seeing was ONE mans Legacy??!! I came to find out later that what we saw there that day was only the tip of the iceberg. My adjudication, something this awesome and a man who took this much responsibility to see men free, and is SO attacked, must be worth looking into. I was right!</Review><Date>1514020378389< /Date><rating>5< /rating><userid>102545374099163740050</userid><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf39687dc3ed:0xa1066f6f3866e69c<//Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

If you have ANY family or friends, don't join.  I was raised in this cult and I can tell you, there is nothing of value here you can't find in books, temples or therapy (which is where most of their beliefs were taken from) and at no cost of losing your family and friends.
Freedom and enlightenment doesn't cost $</review>

I visited Scientology International a few years ago.  I quickly started to figure out that they cared about the people of earth like their own family members!!! They were very friendly and paid 100% attention in explaining about things to me.</review>

This is a stellar group of people who want to make possible a better life for everyone. They run the various Churches of Scientology, which is a huge job requiring dedication and know-how. I am one of those whose life has been improved, many times over, over the course of 50 years.<//review>

There's an extraordinary exhibition where you can learn about both Dianetics and Scientology.  You can also find out about the worldwide humanitarian actions being done to help mankind.  Inside the management building area, I have only received fast, courteous and professional help.  The staff there are friendly and very helpful.< /review>

It seems there are many bad reviews from people who have never actually stepped foot at the Church, I bet so many just got paid to write these bad reviews.... I personally been a member for over 20 years and love every minute of it. The Church had saved my life so many times over! Without it - I can definitely say I wouldn't be alive today....<//review>

My friend and I were treated very nicely. We were shown a video and they were quick to try and answer our questions. Then towards the end we began getting pressured into buying several books, books that I believe were about $20 a piece. I didn't like that. As a former missionary for a Christian church, we would give away as many books as people would take. We didn't mark up the prices of the books to try and make a buck off of investigators. I absolutely would've taken a book if they would've freely offered me one.< /review>

Having worked there myself and know many people there, I can say from first hand experience that these guys work very hard and are very dedicated to helping improve mankind.

The fine people at this organization implement global programs that teach your children to read, get your friends off drugs, and lend a helping hand to you and your neighbors at major disasters.

<Text>Most of the negative reviews here I think are from disgruntled people who never gave these guys a fare shake or are influenced by media outlets who post stories of a ridiculously slanted view in favor of the controversy.

In my honest opinion from what I know about Scientology and the men and women who support it, they are some of the nicest people out there who's only flaw is that they care too much about trying to help a decaying sinful planet earth.

As for this location particularly its a beautiful well kept building and is home to the L. Ron Hubbard Theatre. The man in his earlier years was a prolific writer and they showcase old radio theater style performances at this venue. A very entertaining way to spend a Saturday night I think. It's worth a visit. At the least it will be if nothing else an eye opener.</Text><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have been a Scientologist since 1968 so I know a good deal of our history.  Under current management we are expanding far faster than ever before all over the world.  More newcomers do Scientology services in one year now than in 50 years in the past - and the earlier 50 years were quite expansive.  Far more people are getting released and going Clear than ever before.  The only thing people really object  to about Scientology is when someone says they are doing it and in actuality do something else or inject some slant.  The current management is very careful to administer Scientology the way Hubbard intended and when that is done the public are very happy.  These men and women work very hard, really care and are doing a great job.</Text>

<review>They are very professional, friendly and have a purpose to help mankind. They attack the harm psychiatry does to the planet by drugging so many people and children, and so they are attacked by the media which receives so much advertising revenue from big Pharma. But the point is that if you ever had any trouble with stress or you want to help yourself or others, they have answers that work and rather than reading what other people say about them, the best way to find out is to read one of their books or do an online course - only that way can you find out for yourself what Scientology is. Personally it changed my life much for the better in many ways like increased memory, confidence, communication skills, and much more.</review><date>1445789855814< /date><UserId.>116095807234047028668<//UserId.></record>

I find it funny how passionate the reviews are on this building. Besides the museum on the first floor it is just an administrative hub for the international outreach programs for the Church and has just has various office spaces, conference rooms, files, etc. so wouldn't be of general interest.

If you want to see what they do, just go to the 8 story information center they put just a few blocks down on the corner of Hollywood and Mccadden. (As a trivia fact that is the same corner where the first LGBT Pride parade was held in LA over 40 years ago!).

You can also go to the next street over on Franklin, or the the next street over in the opposite direction on Sunset Blvd, or a little further down on Hillhurst or just over the hill in Burbank.

Scientology owns more real estate in Hollywood than anyone else for the last 30 years or so, and wont be leaving anytime soon, so you have plenty of chances and locations to explore if you are interested.

If you don't want to leave the house you can tune in anytime to their just- launched TV network broadcasting from Hollywood to Direct TV Channel 320, all online streaming platforms including Apple TV or on the Scientology Network App for Android and I-phone.< /Text>

This is totally a positive place to be, I’ve noticed time and time again that it is places like this one, ones that are working to tell us all about the real deal in our society that often get mistreated.

If one is wise and able to see and experience for one self, one will look!

Many who are fearful and simply unable to experience will say many things but it’s a sign that they can’t look.

I learned a lot about their social betterment activities and they are simply something to admire and support.

Their life improvement sessions and trainings really cover some of the coolest and most basic life issues we all tend to have in this society.

Dianetics was a subject that answered many of my questions on the subject of the mind and behavior.

So yes, recommended!!!!</review>

The people here are very friendly and ready to answer questions.  And you can get a tour of the L. Ron Hubbard Life Exhibition.  The man was really a polymath (person of wide-ranging knowledge or learning), probably with a wider range than Leonardo Da Vinci, and he lived a very active life—very interesting tour; unlike any other.

There are a lot of malicious people in media ready to denigrate ANY religion as long as they can "get away with it."  Don't listen to propaganda; go visit and talk to some actual Scientologists and make up your own mind.

By the way, I just looked at there are several hundred fake one-star reviews from six years ago that are pretty obviously all from the same disgruntled person using a bunch of fake accounts (they all are from "A Google User" and most are completely non-sequitur or empty).  Whereas the five star reviews seem to be written by people like me who actually went there or who know something about Scientology...so, yeah.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been receiving junk mail and magazines from this organization for about a year and finally called them to get removed from the list. Very very rude people.  I will just keep throwing the paper and magazines in the trash.  What a wasteful company. I have no idea how they  an got my info.</Review>

<Review>I really enjoyed some of the 1 star ratings, especially ones that said things like they thought it was a Steak & Shake restaurant,  or they were chlorophormed & robbed by guys in Guy Fawks masks. Very creative.
I've been a Scientologist for 25 years, & never once heard reference to anyone named Xenu, btw. If you walk into a church, you'll see a wall of books and courses, with titles like "How to have a Better Marriage. "
I won't say my Church is all wonderful and perfect.  It's like any group: you get all sorts of people,  from kind to rude, smart to dull. But as an overall,  this group is kinder than any other I know. They greatly value health,  & it shows as you walk around. People look healthier & smile more than any other group I know. Test it. Walk down L Ron Hubbard way, just look, nothing else, and you'll see. People, smile more,  walk with confidence more... We're not perfect,  but we care, & we work hard to make our community better< /Review>< user>

< review>
I've been to a few to check it out. I'm a very bright individual myself, so there is nothing actually useful that any church or organization can teach me that I already haven't learned on my own. All my lessons from life and experience itself. I agree Scientology's presentation is silly and feels fictional which makes it hard to take them seriously, but they do make valid points if you understand what they try to explain, but fail to present it to others who aren't already part of their groups. I can see the founder had good intentions, but now passed away. Who ever is now running the show seems to be using this more as a mean to gather money than to focus on the individuals, hence why it feels like a bunch of cheesy advertisement about their books, with fiction novel covers. They are like any other religion and church I've come across: "Support us, buy books from us, donate what you don't need, so we can give it to the needy and take credit for it that we did something, but never really waste any money and rarely out our way to truly help someone." That seems to be many church and religions' golden rule. I don't have a problem with Scientology other than them following that same rule. Their teachings are in ways accurate and sincere but misrepresented and feel like bullshit, due to poor management and communication. I would however deem anyone as mentally confused or lost, that attacks this belief system but believe in an inaccurate, heavily edited and mistranslated 2000 year old book about a man who believed himself to be god and freed the men in this world of their sin but left the world to continue in conflict. Scientology is silly, but doesn't go out their way to push bullshit down your throat or completely misguide already lost individuals, like other religions do, unless you walk into their buildings, but still more tolerable I'd say. I put good in quality, but I actually consider my experience and their quality as Fair.

ONE IMPORTANT NOTE TO REVIEWERS:

The founder is dead, do not blame him for your bad experiences. Judging one's beliefs due to being Sci Fi writers is as low as you can go. I am a Sci Fi writer myself, and I implement many of my beliefs and feelings to my stories, just as many writers, artist, and cultures do to their forms of arts. Just as fiction was implemented to many religions, the bible, and is even incorporated with science to prove what may be possible. Sometimes implementing beliefs, knowledge and advice in entertainment is the only way to pass it on to those with short attention spans or lacking interest in raw information. Lets agree that we all need to learn respect, and reflection, to understand one another better in life. - Avenx<//review>

This is the Church Administration building for the fastest expanding religion in the world. Finding out for yourself if Scientology is for you is what anyone can and should do, instead of believing bigots and hatemongers.< /review>

This place does so much for Clearwater!  When the hurricane came the boarded up all the downtown stores without being asked too, and after they provided water, shelter, food and helped with the Clean Up more so than any other group I saw!!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a magical place where you can find yourself and the answers to the questions that inevitably we make as human beings. A tip? Do not listen to anyone go and find out for yourself!

It is the seat of the Church of International Scientology, the only religion where you learn to know for yourself.

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) My parents lost 3 children, they were broken, the company was bankrupt. My mother had been listed (a psychiatrist) as a case of "chronic depression." He did therapy in the Organization and left the well, life came back. My dad on the other hand, following the path of education, I take the company forward and today is one of the few manufacturers, developers in Argentina. Thank you very much to all the scientologits and hopefully more people can get to take advantage of the knowledge and therapy they provide! (Oh and my parents did not return to Scientology after this, not because they had been in bad relations with the organization, but they did not need more, by my side, I continued !!) :)

(Original)
Mis padres perdieron 3 hijos, estaban destrozados, la empresa estaba en la quiebra. A mi mamá la habían catalogado (un psiquiatra) como un caso de "depresión crónica". Hizo terapia en la Organización y salió del pozo, volvió la vida. Mi papá por otro lado, siguiendo el camino de la educación, saco adelante la empresa y hoy en día es uno de los pocos fabricantes, desarrolladores de Argentina. Muchísimas gracias a todos los scientologits y ojalá más gente pueda llegar a aprovechar de los conocimientos y la terapia que brindan!! (Ah y mis padres no volvieron a Scientology luego de esto, no porque hubieran quedado en malas relaciones con la organización, sino que no les hizo falta más, por mi lado, yo seguí!!) :)< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I used to order every week and thought the staff was wonderful but I don’t know what happened I ordered and they were clearly busy the pizza took a long time to get delivered and both pizzas were burned. I called to let them know to slow down because they were sending out burnt pizza and they only offered to replace one pizza next order, so that was not cool to leave us hanging like that. I ended up giving them another chance after that and ordered delivery again and this time as I was eating a slice there was a hair baked into the crust and it was so gross it still makes me sick to think about it and I haven’t ordered since. I don’t know what’s going on there but I no longer trust their sanitation or that I’m getting properly prepared quality food and it’s a Bummer because I really liked this place.< /Text>

Tried this pizza for the first time about a month and a half ago, been there 4 times since.  This flavored stuffed crust satisfies every taste bud my mouth has to offer.  It even kept my kid quiet for a whopping 11 minutes. I've been eating pizza professionally now for over 37 years and this one is a close second of not tied in the lead.  I'll leave that up to you.< /text>

< Review>
Walked in and placed my order for a personal pizza and a drink. Paid cash. She told me it would be about 15 minutes. When 15 minutes was up I still didn’t have my pizza. Upon asking they told me it would be about 30 more minutes. What!!! Yes, see supposedly a bunch of orders came in via not walk in and they got priority over mine. Sad way to do business in my opinion. Yes it was not a large order but people who walk in and pay cash deserve to be served in a timely manor too!! Management only said sorry and gave me my money back.<//Review>

Definitely better than other two big pizza chains in terms of taste. The price is quite competitive or even better with their coupons.  Just place order online, double check everything before clicking order confirm button, drive there to pick it up and enjoy!<//review>

I love hungry howie's! Their pizza is awesome, and you can choose from a variety of flavored crust. My personal favorite is either the garlic and herb or the buttered crust.  Their pizza rolls are also really good!  Another thing I love about hungry howie's is their dessert options.  They have brownies which are delicious, and you definitely can't go wrong with the cinnamon howie's bread!  This hungry howie's location is carry out or delivery only, no dine in.< /Text>

I’ve been a returning customer now for the last three years and always find the best deal possible from Steve and The personnel are very professional and knowledgeable.

Thank you.

I definitely do not recommend purchasing a used truck from Penske Used Truck Sales in Torrance. My company purchased a 2016 Freightliner in February and was promised in writing that multiple different issues would be fixed, prior to taking possession,  which took almost one month. These issues included most importantly some major rust issues throughout the frame and other areas.    When I went to take possession of the truck, absolutely none of those problems were fix. So I refused to take possession of the truck until these issues were resolved. Well almost one month later I went to take possession of the truck and it still has multiple issues wrong with the truck. Basically all Penske did was paint over the existing rust.  The associates at Penske will not respond to my emails and/or calls the majority of times and are not helpful or professional. Once again, I would not advise anyone to purchase a used truck at Penske Truck Sales in Torrance.< /text>

<review>I have been in the transportation business for 26 years I have purchased several vehicles from Penske due to their high maintenance standards and great deals. My sales rep, Nina Villegas from Penske Torrance, CA  has truly taken my experience to another level. More than helpful to get me the lowest price on several vehicles I purchased. Her customer service has exceeded my expectations during and after my purchases. I would gladly buy from Penske again thanks to Nina.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><user>109966882118698608752<//user><username>Abel Aranda< /username><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd354e22eb31db:0x677d0d152edb29be</gmapID>< time>

After shopping nationwide for the best truck at the best price, we chose Penske Used Trucks in Torrance, CA! The customer service was outstanding, the truck met all of my expectations, and the purchasing process was so easy. If I need another truck, Penske will be the first place I go!<//Text>

<Text>We are a Local So Cal Transportation Company that in the last Decade have had the need to acquire newer Trucks to comply with CA Regulations. I highly recommend Daysi Vargas to be your point of contact when in need of additional trucks in your business. She is an amazing person, always willing to help and clear any questions before and after the purchase. We have acquired over 10 units from her and all i can say is that she has been always honest, helpful and committed to provide the best service possible. She always goes the extra mile. Thanks for all your hard work and dedication. Please don't go any where else, we still need to acquired a few more units in the up coming years.

penske used trucks are very hard to do business with.

<date>1619040720695</date><Review>So I have purchased a couple trucks from this location and while I cannot speak for everyone there I will say that Nina Villegas is the absolute best. She follows up to make sure everything went well, she has the customers best interest at heart. The last reefer truck I purchased the price went up online before I could make my deposit and she reached out to the manager out in Arizona to get me back the price that it was listed at before. Also on the first truck I had a couple issues and they set it up within the first couple weeks to be checked out at my local Penske yard. Only regret is the 3rd party warranty NTP is a waste and the don’t cover anything, the say the truck wasn’t maintained properly and deny the claim so if you want to waste $6600 like I did go ahead and buy it.</Review><user>104909255063692508672< /user><gmapID>0x80dd354e22eb31db:0x677d0d152edb29be</gmapID><name>Andy Mohammed< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rating>5< /rating></record>

< Review>
In all 20 years in business I have never had to deal with such unprofessional behavior!! I purchased a $40,000 Freightliner from Penskee with home warranty at premium level. The sales management as well as reception team were all very dismissive and not willing to take any kind of action to resolve the situation . The manager Paul, refused to even speak to me , Victor Bruno was my salesman, who promised me everything would be on the up and up, and when nothing was as promised he simply prolonged talking to me and began ignoring me.  Amber J. everyone blamed as well as another ex manager that had quit .

-I received a truck with a check engine light on and a multitude of issues.
-The turbo is failing-
The tires were gouged and worn down not to -Department of transportation standard-
-The truck didn’t even have mudflaps-
-The brakes were rusted all the way down-
-The rollup door will not roll up in the back it’s corroded corroded and rusted-

Upon arrival and detection of the issues and hundreds of emails and calls to Penske. There has been no results and Penske has continually shamed me off for up to almost 4 months now.
I asked for a simple diagnosis and to resolve some of the issues clearly that were not premium and the mechanics at Penskee told me “they were too busy to fix the issues” and Penskee was not able to get me in for a few months.
I made it clear to Penske I could not have a truck sitting for months after it had been sitting for months without being resolved, I had paid $40,000 for a premium running truck.  I now have lost approximately $30,000 in rental fees and job loss due to Penske‘s inability to keep their promises both vocally and contractually.   I requested to take the truck to a certified Freightliner mechanic so they could resolve the issues and Penske can pick up were they promised via premium and under their warranty. Their response to me was they would get back to me and when they had a slot open with their mechanics they would let me know which is months away.  No business is able to run with their truck sidelined for months.
I have no choice but to take  The responsibility for Penskee and fix these issues and present this to Penske in court.
This is a warning to anybody buying from Penske!
They do not stand behind their product they will ignore you and sell you something completely aside from what they’re promising you!
I have asked simply for what Penske has promised they would do for me from the beginning signing the contract.  This is by far the worst experience I’ve ever dealt with in my whole life.</Review>

<gmapID>0x80dd354e22eb31db:0x677d0d152edb29be</gmapID><Text>We went to into Penske looking for a used truck. Daysi helped us out. She sent me information of the inventory they had there in Torrance and some other trucks they had at other Penske locations so I had more choices to look thru. We purchased a 2013 Hino. They had the truck ready for pick up in a timely matter. So far we are happy with our purchase and our experience at Penske. At no time did we feel any pressure to rush into buying just any truck they had available. Daysi was there to answer our questions by either email or phone. We will definitely be contacting Penske and Daysi when it comes to buying our next used truck. Keep in mind they sell the truck, but we had to take care of all the paperwork at the DMV.</Text><user>108158673957170311478</user>< Pictures>

<Review>5/20 Update: Another month has gone by and they are still charging me for the truck that they are supposedly buying back. I am livid! Not to mention I still have yet to receive the refund that was promised for the registration amount of almost $5000! I was told this process would take a few weeks and it has been months!!! Everyone involved has to be chased down and when they do respond they blame the other people involved. I can't express how much inconvenience and stress this whole thing has caused. On top of it the one Penske truck that I did keep has already needed the liftgate repaired after 1 month of use, to the tune of $750. I can't say it enough. Stay away from Penske Used Trucks!!!

4/15 Update: Liftgate on the one truck I do have stopped working and communication is still terrible. Cannot wait to be done with this. Very frustrating experience.

4/2 I do not recommend purchasing from Penske Used Trucks. I purchased two trucks one of which was fine. The other one had significant issues with the box and was unsatisfactory at the time that I came to pick it up. It's been over a week and I have no information as to how or when it will be taken care of. I've been paying for a truck for two weeks that I still do not have in my possession. The communication between the local dealership and the corporate office is terrible and I've dealt with 10 different people during the process. Sloppy communication and very poor customer service. Stay away!</Review>< date>

They sold me 3 trucks in the past 2 years and all 3 trucks broke . First truck engine died in the first 2 months after purchase . Second truck lasted only for 1 year and 5 months and third truck I just bought and I cane to pick it up at their Torrance location as soon as employee of Penske pulled up on this truck the check engine light came on after I inspected the truck I learned that lift gate is not working and there is a hole in the roof of the box . All trucks were bought in premium conditions . The truck were no near premium condition. DONT TRUST THIS COMPANY THEY ARE LIERS , THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THERE CUSTOMERS ONLY ABOUT THEIR PROFIT. During process of my purchases no one even called me to give me an update on anything I had to call everyday myself. Horrible customer service .
P.S . Also be very careful with their contract they are not liable for anything , not for loss of work or for your time . I paid for the truck and waited for 3 weeks after the payment for them to deliver the truck they lied to me all this 3 weeks and I had to pay my loan for this time they still had the truck.<//Text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The best experience that I have in the past, the best customer service, is with Ms. Daysi Vargas, from the beginning to the end, in the search and purchase of my trucks, really if those 5 stars take them as 10, they elect me, people like Daysi Vargas, they should have that they do not forget their clients, they are at pending from the beginning to the end of the process, and I still had a problem with the 2 trucks, and she continued to help me, because where they delivered the 2 trucks they had said that they had done the test drive and that everything was fine, and when they I picked up, I immediately felt the problem, I contacted daysi, at the same moment he made a copy of the email he sent, to the person who is in charge of contacting the shop, and that person never answered, then I sent him the information on the problems, and I never answered, and then Daysi told me to go to the nearest Penske there was, and to ask for the code of that place and send it to her by Email, and she was the one who helped me a lot, very bad experience with the rest of the penske staff I don't know how penske has become so popular, but with the service that Daysi Vargas gave me, finally, I give it 10 stars.

Daysi Vargas, de el principio al fin, en la busca y la compra de mis camiones, en verdad si esas 5 estrellas las toman como 10, me elegra, personas como Daysi Vargas, deverian tener que no se olvidan de sus clientes, estan al pendiente de principio al fin del proceso, y aun tuve un problema con los 2 camiones, y ella me siguio ayudando, porque donde me entregaron los 2 camiones habian dicho que les habian echo la prueba de manejo y que todo estuvo bien, y cuando los recogi, inmediatamente le senti el problema, me comunique con daysi, en el mismo momento me hizo copia del Email que envio, a la persona que se encarga de contactarse con el shop, y esa persona nunca contesto, despues le volvi yo a mandar la informacion de los problemas, y nunca contesto, y entonces me dijo Daysi que yo fuera al Penske mas cercano que hubiera, y que preguntara del codigo de ese lugar y se lo enviara por Email, y ella fue la que me a ayudado muchisimo, muy mala experiencia con el resto del personal de penske, no se como penske se a echo tan popular, pero con el servicio que me brindo Daysi Vargas, difinitiva mente, le doy 10 estrellas.</review>

(Translated by Google) The service from Daysi Vargas, is the best, she is very friendly, she helped me a lot when it came to getting the truck, she is an excellent saleswoman, and if I got 10 stars I would give it to her for the attention she gave me as a customer ...
It is something that I cannot say regarding the shop area I have a lot of disagreement in that area very bad customer service ... from the people in charge ...

I've been visiting Wess's through at least the last three owners. For almost 50 years if you are set up for keeping chickens, ducks, bunnies or various ruminants  this is the best place for beginners, and hobbiests. The newest owners are knowledgeable, and great natured, plus the prices are competitive. There are two other  fees stores within a few miles, but for my needs, Wess's is best.< /text>

Wes's has great prices on feed/by the pound for all sorts of animals. They actually have goats, chickens,  and farm  type animals unlike most pet shops in the area. They tend to be more affordable than the major pet chains and have knowledgeable staff as far as raising animals goes.<//Text>

We went on a Sunday I walked out with seven chicks and plenty of great first timer info. The young lady that helped us was amazing.

I have also gotten chicks at a different store and they r Ill and one has passed. I will only go to Wes from now on. Not one issue with my girls.< /review>

I love this Barn Yard and Averie,  Pet feed store. Store is run by Mario, the nicest person you will run across. The prices are very reasonable, lowest I have found. You will also find farm Animals here for sale.</text>

Their store is very interesting and welcoming. They are never obsessively breathing behind your neck, they give you a chance to look around first. The only upside of this store is that they can’t really tell the gender of chicks. We went to get two roosters and a hen and ended up with all hens.< /Review>

Please please please do not go here. Save yourself. This place has gone downhill rapidly.  The shelves were empty, there were dead chicks with their faces completely decomposed in the cage with live chicks.  They had no chickens on site but he "knew a guy." I had heard nothing but good things about this place but something must've happened recently. I would suggest San Dimas Grain, it's about 20 minutes away and everything you're looking for.  Clean everything, helpful people, lots of variety, reasonable prices, and a large selection.<//review>

This place has changed ownership so some of the past reviews might not be so good. But the new owner has turned Wes's back around to what it was years ago. I love this little feed store. I  go  when I need things like hay or Timothy Hay or some feed for wild birds or chickens. On this trip I went for hay dor my manger scene. I was able to buy part of a bale, (one bale would have been $8, not a lot of money but I didn't need a whole bale of hay) While I was there I noticed he didn't have any chickens for sale. The owner told me that a disease has hit the southern California area, Virulent Newcastle Disease (VND) (it is deadly to birds especially chickens and is very contagious) so he can't sell chicks until December. Great service, friendly people, small and interesting. It's local kind of business that I really love.<//Text>

<review>I spoke with the owner and gave him a list of chicken breeds I wanted, five in total.  He said he could get anything, and said most likely the following week.  This went on for over 9 weeks, being told it would be the following week.  And I had to contact him each week, never rec'd a follow up call.  I never ended up getting the chickens from him.  He never got them in and never called me to keep me updated.  So as far as I'm concerned, I've now been waiting twelve months.  (I did end up buying them elsewhere after the 10th week, but I'm making a point).<//review><rate>2<//rate></record></dataset><record>

The only things this place should sell is cages and feed.. Supplies.. the animals are al mal kept/maintained. Poor things I	felt like buying them all and setting them free. The birds pluck their feathers in distress.. Chickens pigeons and misc feathered animals in the same cages.. almost puked..< /text>

There was a dead chick inside the cages and most of the other chicks look really sick. The ducks, pigeons, and chickens in the back of the store were also in horrible condition and acting aggressive toward each other. Also, the water for many of the birds were filthy. I feel sorry for those birds and how they are probably suffering.😔👎< /review>< pics>

Bought a vape and it had a burnt coil and tasted like absolute nastiness and they said there's nothing they can do about it. STAY AWAY. Clearly they have no interest in ensuring customer satisfaction. Literally got ripped off for 13 dollars.</text>

Spent only a short time at The Cave, but that's all I needed to be able to say it's one of the best vape shops in the area. For starters, their prices are very fair -- far from the disgusting gouging going on at places like Voltage. As with any brick-and-mortar shop, prices are always going to be higher than they are online, but you also get your product right then and there. I visited the Cave to pick up a new pod/pod-mod device, I was interested in checking out the RPM80 but they didn't have it in stock. The staff member helping me gave me some recommendations and I was surprised to see their prices were so close to online prices... I noticed the Novo X was in the $20-$30 range -- Voltage sold me one for $60 (before tax) about a month ago. So after seeing this, I felt comfortable just comparing features and asthetics and choosing a device that way, rather than worrying about price. The staff member recommended the Nord 2 and I went with that. Love it so far. Another great thing about vjsiting the Cave was, unlike Leeland's, they were actually open during posted business hours. Will definitely be coming back here soon to pick up some coils! The Cave's professionalism is a breath of fresh air after dealing with subpar shops recently.  👍👏💯< /review>

If I lived closer I would be in this shop twice a week, the only thing that was better than the price was the outstanding customer service. Looking forward to coming back soon.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>The people who work here are fairly knowledgeable and extremely friendly. They have a fantastic selection of liquids and filters, and spend a lot of time with me every time I go to make sure I get exactly what I'm looking for. They are also diligent about matching the name on your card to your ID, which is uncommon these days and very much appreciated. This is now my sole source for vape liquid purchases, and they're open late which is ideal for those of us on swing shift that often don't get a chance to go shopping until most places are closed.

This is a fantastic shop. I can't express how happy I am that they opened this shop out here. Their main shop in San Mateo is one of all time favorite shops. They have a great selection at this location along with very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. I can't stress how hard it is to find a shop that has knowledgeable staff for the item's I'm generally searching for. Highly recommend stopping by< /review>

<review>Excellent customer service. I had a minor problem and Ryan fixed it immediately with a kind word and a smile on his face. That, on top of their good prices and excellent selection, has earned them a customer for life.  You rarely find service like this anymore. I'm telling all my friends to check this place out.</review>< userid>

Incredible service from all of the employees I've had the pleasure of dealing with. Super knowledgeable about all the glass and attachments. Awesome prices on vape gear cheaper than my local spot. Honestly just a dope convienience store attached to an art gallery run by dope people who are super friendly.< /Text>

WORST STORE-rude and inexperienced and overpriced. i went here out of desperation because my usual store was out of my atomizers. asked for a specific dual-CORE atomizer that i have been using for years. the name and ohms is on the box! i went to show the worker and he grabbed my gear and broke the seal so now i have to buy a new tank! no apology or offer to pay for what he broke. Then went on to lecture me on how i was wrong about asking for a dual-COIL atomizer. Core- not COIL you geniuses. Then another woman behind the counter marches over to use a nasty tone to lecture me some more on coils. i said fine & that i didn't want to argue THREE times. Then they would not give me a receipt until i insisted. What goes around comes around.< /review>

Very friendly, patient and helpful staff. They've done their research. There isn't one staff member at The Cave  who has ever said "I have no idea." They know their merchandise.< /review>

Place look like your average Smokeshop, looks like a decent number of pieces, but they didn't have the one I was looking for. Nor did the to Stoner bros who worth working in the shop seem to really care to find something that would work as a stand-in.< /text>

Went in for a vape pen, to be sold a battery charger claimed to be a vape pen. Upon return was told have to contact third party for refund.   They smile and said my mistake since they do not sell vape pens.  Funny, that is what I asked for.  It is too bad.  Service used to be good.  Guess they hit bad times.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Best Sandwiches I have ever had. The bread is lightly crispy and on the outside and soft and tasty with every bite. Perfect amount of meat and condiments. A big crunchy bite FULL of taste each time. I am originally from San Francisco and have moved to Sacramento in the early 2000's. I will drive there when I get craving for a perfect sanwich. I have loved their sandwiches for like 30 years or close to it.<//text>< Pictures>

Roxie Food Center is incredible. Junior size is just right but if you have bigger appetite then order for bigger, still excellent quality! Highly recommended!<//review>

Roxie sandwiches are well made to how you want it.

Soooooo delicious!!!!!!!

Buy two, one for your girlfriend/boyfriend and switch halves.

Tony runs a happy crew and clean environment.

Who says that you can't eat a sandwich for dinner? Stop by Roxie's after work and get your jumbo sandwich, chips and drink....then settle back to watch your favorite movie, sports or tv program.

Relax and enjoy your Roxie sandwich.<//text>< UserId.>

<Review>Had been here 40 yrs ago. Going to memory lane. After swimming recreation time with all my friends on the wkends. We as friends would put all our money together & buy a long sandwich & have them cut it for 5 of us. Also purple licorice was our favorite. Great times!! I did buy potato salad. Which was delicious also. Then waited for my Mortadella w/everything on it except jalapenos..it was b4 12noon. I looked back.There was a long line. Owner came out & handed me my bag.
Very polite & humble.. went back to sit at the park.
Couldn't wait to start on half of my sandwich.. so delicious added with a sunny breeze of nice weather.. Happy 2021 you all<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>I just had to change my 5 star rating to 2 stars. My order said microwave meat and cheese, no onions, no mustard they sent it like this. And to make matters worse this was my birthday dinner request. For years they were great. Since pandemic they have declined in customer service. I'm deeply disappointed. 😔<//Review>< userid>

<review>Prices have gone up 3 to 4 dollars based on their menu prices. They got our order wrong when we came home and no one would answer the phone. 4 sandwiches for 52 dollars. Totally not worth it.

This place is a hidden gem! They have the best sandwiches on Dutch crunch bread.  This is not a typical sandwich spot as it also doubles as a liquor store, but do not let that scare you.  Try any one of the specials on Dutch crunch bread you won't be disappointed!< /review>

<Text>Roxie's has the best sandwiches in this side of town by far. I recommend calling in your order prior to arrival since it's kinda cramped.
Their sandwiches are huge, even a junior sized one. I usually order their veggie cause it one of the most complex veggie sandwiches in the city. They include pickled artichokes, tri colore salad, avocado, lettuce, red onion, pickles and jalapenos. It is hearty for a veggie sandwich.
If you're afraid of green food the tritip and the pastrami are tasty. They have several yummy sandwich combos to choose from.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

<Review>Great Sandwiches and great people. I've been doing to Roxies since o was a young child. My friends and I would go swimming across the street then get a cheese sandwich heated up for 75 cents when we were young. It was the greatest and to this day it's still just as good with  even better memories!!!</Review>< Pics>

The bread is just crunch and light, not like any sandwich I’ve tasted. The filling is good too, simple and fresh. Two of us shared one big long sandwich.

Will come back here if we ever come near this part of SF, to try all the other flavour.</review>

Been going here since 1995. Makes me kinda like a newbie. Met  Simon and Pete when I lived in mission terrace. Kind of guys who know everyone's name. Make you feel like a regular in no time... Like "cheers" lol. Bottom line... Best Sandy's in town. They do good biz, but you never have to wait more that 5 minutes. I usually call ahead and then just grab and go. Try supreme roast beef, toasted.
OK not the best pic.. What can you do?< /review>

I've been meaning to get a sandwich here for all of my adult life, today I finally did.  It was a solid, old school, deli style sandwich, done well.  For the price, definitely worth it.  Great customer service, too.< /Text>

Absolute best sandwhiches in California hands down. They are known for their Dutch crunch. The Turkey club is one of my favorites. This is a must try and is definitely worth an hour drive if needed. Owner and his wife are both amazing people.< /review>

<review>BEST SANDWICHES IN THE CITY THEY SMOKE THEIR OWN TRI TIP. The owners are wonderful neighbors, will usually let you try the tri tip and it will convince you. The Roxie is also a good Italian style sub with mortadella. My husband loves the crab salad as a side. The chip and candy selection is pretty slick lots of rare finds like voodoo chips and international candy.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Small grocery store, but they shine with their deli. Lots of options, including vegetarian. You can call in and they will have your sandwich waiting when you get there, although we usually just show up and order--it doesn't take that long.

Great family vibe from the folks working there. They are always friendly with anyone walking in.</Review>

Very nice, gave us cash for the bus even without us having to buy something.

Then he drew us in by giving sandwich samples. It convinced us to buy one it was so good.< /Review>

I heard about this place from my storage place. I figured why not, it's on my way home and I haven't had a really good classic sandwich in a long time. Upon arrival I knew this was going to be an awesome place just on the smell alone. A complete hole in the wall spot where everyone knows everyone. The options were simple and straightforward, I got the roxie special. I decided it was too nice of a day to eat this hunched over my laptop trying to work. So i walked across the street to Balboa Park and ate this beauty. I cant remember the last time I had a sandwich this good!</text>

<rating>4<//rating><text>I tumbled upon it and I was pleasantly surprised. They offer Roast Beef as a meat choice and it is pretty darn good. The sandwich is fairly thick, the ingredients taste fresh and they balance it well compared to the meat, the bread they use is good (I order Dutch crunch anytime I can) and the sandwich is properly toasted. They go for "Junior" for the smallest size, note that the "Regular" size is quite filling. It does get soggy pretty quickly due to the mayo/mustard so either you need to eat it right away or ask them to be light on those two.<//text>< Pics>

Love this place so much, we ate here twice during our 4 day visit. Houston has a lot of great food, but we don't have sandwiches like this. And Simon is so nice. I'm gonna crave this place when we get back. Pro tip: If this is your first time, order with the people cooking,  then tell Simon what you ordered when you pay.<//Review>

Small grocer with food options including salad, spagetti and pasta, alcohol etc.
Tried the Simon's special sandwich, slightly pricey but good. Recommend to add on avocado as well! Please note that there's no sitting area provided.<//Review>

Easily my top 5 sandwich place in San Francisco. Toasted salami sandwich is a hit every time. The regular size is enough for two to share, but with their options you'll find your partner wanting her/his own.< /text>

Simply put, they make the best sandwiches with the freshest ingredients!  The bread is ALWAYS FRESH, and makes the sandwich.  Try the Tony Special which is delicious!<//Text>

Hand down, BEST Sandwiches in San Francisco! I'm so lucky to live in the Excelsior and have Roxie's just a hop, skip and jump away! My go to is a Regular Mortadella on Sourdough, everything on it, toasted. Some people think the bread to meat ratio is 60:40 but I think it's perfect. The guys that run the place are hilarious and never fail to make everyone feel welcome.

Although getting in line can be a bit confusing for people when they first come here, it's totally worth it. (For those who haven't tried Roxie's yet: When you come in the front door, walk along the drinks and sodas, and the line starts at the first deli case)

Keep up the great work, Roxie's</Review>

We stopped in here to get a couple of sandwiches and a bottle of wine for a hike. We chatted with the owners for a bit, and they were friendly enough to give us a corkscrew when they found they didn't have any screw top wine bottles, as we had forgotten ours at home.

And the sandwiches were fantastic as well.<//review>

<Review>A local favorite. Appearing simply as a corner store, the sandwiches made behind the counter have the quality equal to nothing less than an established Deli. The toasted Roxie special on dutch crunch bread is a hefty lunch and a safe choice for newcomers.</Review>< Response>

<review>Hole in the whole sandwich spot. There's no place for you to sit but there is a nice park across the street.

The sandwiches are bomb. There's plenty of chips and beverages to choose from.</review><user>100833624587775032833</user>< rate>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have always really liked sandwiches. But this last time I went they weren't the same. Besides, they did not make them to me as ordered.
