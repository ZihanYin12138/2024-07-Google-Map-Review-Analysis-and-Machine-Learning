I love this place. The women here and friendly, professional, and super amazing. My dog always comes out clean and cute. Be advised, they are going to cash only starting 2018. Worth it<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80c25b0b8141a743:0x883255a31f9d5bba<//gmapID><text>I took my seven month old kitten here, and absolutely loved it! I just needed her nails clipped, and places like Petco were way too overpriced and didn't have any cat groomers, so I turned to this place upon recommendation. I'm so glad I called here! I didn't have to wait weeks for an appointment, I just had to come during their hours, which I loved thoroughly. And the woman who took in Chloe was so nice! I had to wait outside due to the virus, and I expected it to take a lot longer than a few minutes, since I didn't know how my kitten would react to this sort of thing, but about three minutes later they were already coming back out! Now I don't have a kitten who gets her claws stuck in blankets and her toys xD
I highly recommend this place, and I will definitely be back again!<//text></record>

Outstanding grooming. Jen is the best. When my rescue dog started going here for grooming,  he was in a muzzle & cone. Now he loves going there. No more muzzle or cone. I won't take him anywhere else.</Review>

Brought my English Bulldog in who is 10 years old and they took great care of my old man. He was so relaxed and happy when I picked him up. Will never go back to the big box pet stores for grooming again. The staff is loving and caring.< /Review>

<review>Thought we were doing a good thing by following our groomer from PetSmart over to here. Very bad mistake. Our dogs came back traumatized with bad cuts and bumps all over them that didn't go away for months. Found out that they use very bad practices here like putting more than one dog in a cage at the same time, not cleaning or sharpening there equipment, and not following the basic guidelines to grooming. NEVER AGAIN WILL I PUT MY DOGS THROUGH THAT TORTURE AGAIN. Since being back at PetSmart, our dogs look beautiful again and they aren't terrified to go to the groomers again.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c25b0b8141a743:0x883255a31f9d5bba< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I bring all my babies to Baxter’s! They are clean and very welcoming everytime I bring all three in! Brianna has been grooming all of them since they were puppies! They’ve become used to the area and get excited when we pull up! They always come home with the cutest bandanas and she does an awesome job at keeping my girl dogs’s always colored and beautiful!</Text>

Always a great experience there for my Dog. They are very good at what they do. My dog always looks and smells great!!!! I would and have recommended Baxters to all my friends and family for their four legged family members. I just love the people that work there too.<//Review>

Jen is so rude. She needs to learn to be more professional. I asked a business in her same mall if they ever used her services and the lady told me that the owner Jen attacked her on social media once for no reason at all. So its clearly she has some anger issues. Please learn how to be professional since you are representing your brand.<//Text>

We had a small fire at our house the day before and to sat the least the were no way any where near white they were more like soot babies which was making me sick. They took the challenger even though they were booked already. And WOW I really just wanted them bathed but they got the whole works and the looked great. Thank you so very much. I will Always remember your kindness.

I have a trusted friend who had a very negative experience. She says she took her dog in for grooming and they released the dog back to her without her collar and dog tags. Then sh had a very difficult time reaching the groomer to get the collar back. And on top of that the dog seemed shell shocked for a couple of days trembling. My friend thinks this might be an isolated case since other people are quite happy with this groomer and like the owner. However, there is very little chance she will use the groomer again.< /Review>

Upon entering this location it is kind of dark and drab, but you are greeted warmly by the staff.  The ambience is a little bit too dark for my liking. Nonetheless the staff is attentive to your needs and is quick to come take your order. When you place your order it will give you an egg drop soup to go along with your entree and water of course unless you would like an additional or different drink. They offer many types of different drinks fruits and teas. Since I am vegan I did not get the soup so they brought me a house salad the dressing on the salad was delicious to say the least. The fact that they provided me a substitution from their normal side dish accompaniment was a plus for me. I ordered a vegetable udon and the Dr. Pepper as well. They offer many different vegetarian and vegan dishes. the server did not know which were which so he quickly went and found out which I greatly appreciated. As I was enjoying the delicious salad my food arrived nice and hot. Not only was this young man very niceit was not shy to check on me to make sure the food and everything was going well. The pitfall to this location is that is close to UCR so many students flock to this location as they are also open until 2 a.m. making it prime location for students to eat late night. The downfall for most customers is that the students are quite loud and I could hardly hear myself think. They tend to come in flocks so the volume level inside the restaurant without any music or anything playing is way above par to say the least. They do offer a happy hour as well. You can also get food delivered from this location via one of the platform ubereats doordash or GrubHub. Lulu the hostess was extremely nice and always has been when I come here to pick up food. Brian my waiter was exceptional as well. I would highly recommend this place if you can deal with the loud noise from all the patrons that visit.< /Text>

Staff is always super even when they have a full house. Definitely worth a return trip. The prices are fair for the quality of food. They have so many good reviews for a reason.< /review>

This location serves, in my opinion, the best hot pot in the area. If my friends and I really want good hot pot we normally have to drive far (about 45-60 minutes) towards Chino or Rowland Heights. I honestly have not tried any of the items on the menu except for the hot pot. I always get the beef pot with spicy miso. I cannot recommend the spicy miso enough.  The broth has the perfect level of flavor that makes all the vegetables and meat just the right level of savory.< /Text>

<review>Love this place, great for late nights when everything else is closed.
I'd suggest the spicy miso soup with pork. Or, on the happy hour menu (10-midnight) the teriyaki chicken and the popcorn chicken basket is great as well.<//review>< userid>

Was pleasantly surprised by this cafe! Was craving shabu shabu and there aren't that many places in the IE with good shabu shabu. They have a great selection of broths and I particularly enjoyed the curry broth. Their boba tea was also very good - better than some of the local boba shops even.</Review>

It's ok. Taste is average. Decent portion size. Friendly staff.  Price is between $3-15. Service is fairly slow.

They don't do happy hour on holidays.<//Text>

It reminded us of our college days when we loved places that would fill you up on the cheap. The spaghetti is definitely "you get what you pay for". You're not getting the Italian style gourmet spaghetti here. It's bland. Hunts tomato sauce out of a can. Spaghetti was a bit over cooked, but hey, it was an appetizer & cheap (under $5), but we wont be ordering it again. We shared a curry soup based hot pot and ordered beef as our protein. I wish the broth had a stronger curry presence. It was watered down. No coffee of any kind served here (bf was hoping for thai coffee). I ordered an Almond Milk Tea with boba & pudding. Ok this came in a huge glass mug, approx 20oz. (I have one at home!) This was the highlight. I liked it, pudding was more of a jello...hmmm... boba was really good. <sigh> We both said that it is what it is & being so close to UCR i can see the allure. I had hoped to be back to try other menu items, but with some of the reviews... I'm hesitant. So sad, i wanted to like this place. Assessment of the service is pretty spot on. We got there when it opened & we saw our waiter when we ordered and again when we were almost finished. Nothing spectacular. Again... im from the SGV, we have hot pot places everywhere. The IE is pretty scarce. Hope they up their game.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The buying and selling process this time around was much more complicated but they continued to surpass our expectations by making it as seamless as possible.  Their expertise and knowledge was so impressive and we were able to get far more for our home than we expected.  And thanks to their guidance, we were able to find a home we are absolutely in love with.  They are simply the BEST.< /review>< Pictures>

Words cannot express how impressed I was with Nadia and her team.  Nadia went above and beyond at every turn, and I couldn’t be happier with the end result.   If you are considering listing your house, I would 100% recommend Nadia and North Compass Realty, you will not be disappointed.    Hands down, best realtor in San Diego County.<//Review>

We are very pleased with the level of service and professional expertise we received during the entire process of purchasing our home in La Mesa, CA.
The attention to customer needs and the personal touch they offer make them special.
They came highly recommended from our son who bought their home with their help as well.

We would not hesitate to highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell their hones.< /Text>

<text>Highly recommend! 5 STARS! From loan approval to closing they help guide you every step of the way. I never thought I could own a home in San Diego, CA. With the talent of Nadia and Anne they helped make my dream come true. They are professional, knowledgeable, patience and held my hand through it all. I recommend all of my friends and family to Anne, she is absolutely amazing. Words can not express how great the experience was to work with North Compass Realty. I am forever grateful to them both. I will be sending pictures of my house after my upgrades are complete. I am a very proud homeowner and it wouldn't have happened without North Compass Realty.

WOW! Working with Anne and Nadia was nothing short of 5 stars!! Being First Timers for selling a home, Anne and Nadia were a wealth of knowledge and made the process seamless! They had our best interest at all times for coordinating the close our home in California with coordinating the close of our other home in a different state!! Anne and Nadia always are quick to respond to any question you may have and provide honest and concise feedback. We were honored to work with them and highly recommend them. Thank you Anne and Nadia for all your hard work!!< /Review>

Nadia and Anne are amazing realtors and such a fantastic team! Their professionalism, knowledge of the market, personal service, and overall performance was hands down the best realtor experience my wife and I have ever had. They used cutting edge marketing and video presentation that sold our house above asking and before the competition. We both sold and purchased our homes with such a smooth transaction and transition. We could not be happier and would use them again if we ever move or buy another property.</Review>

<review>Nadia and Anne are just the best Agents I have worked with.  They are actually more than your real estate agents, more like experienced consultants and friends. They are very friendly, extremely knowledgeable, efficient and confident to get your transaction completed. We saw this house Nadia was listing, we met her and made decision on the top of purchasing. Nadia worked with us and the seller in a lighting speed. Along the way She provided timely check ups and followed up at all important junctures until the escrow was closed. Anne was also such an sweet person to work with. She graciously offered help showing the house to potential tenants before it was closed.  Nadia and Anne are an excellent team together and they will have your best interests at heart. I will certainly work with them again for my next real estate transactions, buying or selling, I am more than confident that they will be at their best!</review>< pics>

This is the second time we’ve used Anne and Nadia and we couldn’t be more thrilled with the outcome. They helped us buy our first home in San Diego and we loved working with them. When it came time to sell we knew exactly who to call! Anne and Nadia made the entire process of selling an absolute breeze.
We were moving out of state in short notice, so when the house was put on the market we were unable to be present during the process. We were a little nervous to be away while selling our home, but Anne and Nadia took care of absolutely everything. Per their recommendation, we decided to have them stage our place and I promise you, it’s the way to go. Their style and  attention to detail made the home look stunning. When Anne sent us the listing we couldn’t believe it was our home! The marketing was incredible and we quickly received an abundance of very competitive offers, as a result of their amazing work. It was on the market for less than two days! We were thrilled with how quickly they got everything moving.

Anne and Nadia made themselves available to answer any and all questions we had and were extremely patient with us first time sellers! If you want an amazing experience buying or selling your home, Anne and Nadia at North Compass Realty are the ladies to call!</Review>

As a first time home buyer, going through the process can be very overwhelming. Nadia and Anne made this experience wonderful. Not only were they prompt at returning messages but they were always one step ahead of the process. They helped my fiancé and I find our dream home on the very fist day of looking! Not only that, they helped us get the home amongst 14 other offers. They are both very personable and we had a great time working with them through out the whole process.< /review>

Nadia and Anne are a professional and hardworking team who made selling my condo a hassle free experience. My case was exacerbated by the fact that I had to be out of town most of the time when the sale process was underway. It worked perfectly after all, and it was all due to Nadia and Anne managing the whole process and being hands-on. They were quick to respond and negotiated hard for me. I strongly recommend Nadia and Anne for your real estate needs. You can be assured your interest will be given top priority. Even after the closing they were ready to help me with my questions, so I felt I was taken care of throughout the entire process. Great experience and great results. Thank you!<//Text>

Anne and Nadia of North Compass Realty were nothing short of amazing.  Their understanding and fine tuned sense of current real estate market conditions enabled them to coordinate a contingent purchase and sale of our house in less than a week and well above asking price.  The above would be enough to warrant a recommendation from me but it is their level of attention to detail, assertiveness on behalf of our interests and customer service that makes me want to post this review.  I give Anne and Nadia of North Compass Realty my highest recommendation.</Text>

I bought my first home with Nadia as my agent. I loved working with Nadia for several reasons. Not only is she very knowledgeable about the real estate market, but she also has such a positive outlook and is so innovative that she makes looking at properties a joy! One of the things I really like about Nadia is her door is always open – she answered all my questions, always made sure the entire process was understandable and easy. Nadia has a genuine passion for taking care of her clients…and it shows!
I have not only recommended Nadia to my family & friends, but have returned to her to help me purchase a couple of investment properties as well. After patiently working with me to find the perfect property, our offer was accepted just as I was leaving the country on a business trip. Nadia took care of all the details and kept me informed as if I was right there the entire time. It is one of the many reasons I cannot say enough about her ability, professionalism, and genuine caring of her clients!< /Text>

She was very knowledgeable and explained things to me in terms I actually understood. She was able to handle any situation that came up with expertise and ease. I was amazed how quickly she sold the properties and was able to get a price that I was very happy with! I intend to use Nadia as my realtor when the next set of properties are for sale. I would refer her to everyone I know with confidence that she would treat them as wonderful as she treated me! Out of a 5 star rating she deserves all 5 stars.”< /Text>

< Review>
We met Anne at an open house and she was so helpful right from the get go. We came down from Orange County a number of times to look at houses with her so she always had at least 5-6 lined up to make best use of our time. We had a four month old at the time and Anne was completely helpful and willing to take breaks when we needed to take care of the baby.  Anne helped us find the perfect house for our family and either though the seller wasn’t quite ready to show it yet, Anne was able to get them to show it to us and then she hand delivered our offer the next day! I highly recommend North Compass Realty!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>As first time home buyers, we could not have been luckier to have been referred to Anne & Nadia. They are the definition of teamwork! Through the process they were very responsive, attentive, and they always made themselves available - seriously even at 10 PM. Together, they walked us through every question to ensure we felt comfortable, and were confident in the choices we were making. Outside of being fun, honest and easy to work with they really went to bat for us – they fought for our best interests when we really needed it - and didn't always know we needed it! We had an incredibly short, 17 day, escrow paired with some hurdles to close on time and they leapt over them and represented everything we wanted. They are truly invested in their clients, and continued to help us out after closing to ensure we have the best experience in buying a home. Over a year and a half later Nadia & Anne stay in touch and genuinely care  about what's happening in our lives. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them and would buy/sell my home with them again.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1580496819149, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your amazing and thoughtful words.

In July we traveled from out of state to sell my parents home.  We were blessed to work with Anne and Nadia.  It had been years since we had bought or sold a home, and coming from a different state we weren’t familiar with the details for selling the house.  Anne sat down with us and thoroughly explained what to expect, timeline, and offered suggestions for making improvements such as a little painting and gardening.  She’s knowledgeable, personable, and very generous with her time. Anne kept us informed of potential buyers, worked very hard and sold the home in a short time frame and for a little higher than the asking price.
At the end of the sale, Anne sent pictures of the garden.  My mother loved her garden and we cherish those pictures!  I can’t express enough how much that meant to all of us.< /Text>

Anne and Nadia worked together as a team to help my family buy a new home, and sell our old home. They both had a wonderful way of keeping us educated, in the loop, and one step ahead of the process so my wife and I felt in total control at all times. The process of buying or selling a home is very complicated and can be emotional but we did not feel overwhelmed with Anne and Nadia on our side. We recommend interviewing this super-team if you're shopping around for a realtor to represent you. You'll likely stop your search when you meet them.< /text>

<review>Nadia was the realtor for the sale of my first home. She made the entire process seem effortless. She was extremely communicative throughout the entire process, and never did I feel out of the loop or unsure of decisions that were made from beginning till end. A great real estate agent is like a doctor on call... and that’s really they only way I could sum up her work ethic. She is driven, intelligent, and has a genuine knowledge of the market. I feel fortunate to have had her on my side during the selling process, and look forward to using her services again.< /review><pics>None< /pics><rate>5<//rate><time>1578616044481</time><name>Denise Memory<//name>< userid>

“Nadia was the absolute best we could ask for! It was our first time buying a house and she was very patient with us. She was our proverbial tour guide, taking the time to walk us through the intricacies of buying and making us feel comfortable with our decision. From putting us in touch with a great lender for our loan, to being there when the appraiser showed up, she continually minimized our effort to keep the ball rolling smoothly. We cannot imagine going through any real estate transaction without Nadia by our side, protecting our interests and fighting for us. We will sing Nadia’s praises from Chula Vista to Oceanside for anyone who is smart enough to listen.”</Text>

We have sold quite a few houses in the past 5 years with multiple realtors, Anne and Nadia by far have exceeded all expectations. They go above and beyond to make you feel at ease with the sale and the purchase of your homes. They are upbeat, positive and willing to bend over backwards to make you feel content and relaxed in the very stressful process. They never said no to us and were constantly making sure we were comfortable with everything. They are thorough and detailed in the explanation of every step in the way. We couldn’t be happier with the experience we had with North Compass and will continue to spread their name and only hope to use them again in the distant future. If you are looking for exceptional realtors that will not let you down, please look no further.< /Text>

<Review>We loved working with Anne and Nadia to find and purchase a home in North County! From the outset, Nadia and Anne were caring and open about our family and our wishes for a new home. They are knowledgeable about the area (super helpful since we were relocating from the Bay Area) and about the housing market here (so different than the Bay). Plus, Anne and Nadia are great communicators and so positive and fun to be around, we had so much fun throughout the process. Nadia and Anne helped us buy the first house we put an offer on — almost unheard of — and they helped us celebrate with a welcome package! Throughout our first year in the home they have been a local resource, sharing their tips for what to do in the area and referring services when we ask — so helpful! We will definitely refer them to friends and family in the future.</Review>< Pictures>

Choosing North Compass Realty and working with Ann and Nadia was one of the best decisions my fiance and I made when buying a house in Southern California. Having moved recently from Colorado, we weren't too familiar with North San Diego County and had to find a house pretty quick.

Anne, who we primarily worked with in our search, was so great in showing us as many houses as she could in two days and made it a smooth,  comfortable process! She was also so sweet and made a spontaneous trip to show us the house again so my parents could check it out!  In addition, both Anne and Nadia were  so helpful on the back-end, helping us negotiate with the seller to get the right deal. Working with the two of them together with their experience combined is definitely a real bonus that you probably don't get elsewhere. Overall, I would highly recommend this company!<//review>

We never had to wonder about anything because before it even became a full fledged thought Nadia would beat us to it by bringing it to the table.

<Time>1578615836575< /Time><rate>5< /rate><review>Working with North Compass Realty was a breeze. We never thought we’d find our dream home so fast and would have such a seamless process.  Not only were Nadia and her team fast, efficient, and honest; they LlSTENED to all of our wants, needs, and questions. They asked questions about the home and property that we wouldn’t have thought to ask and they negotiated items into the contract that we are sure, saved us a lot of money. They always had our best interest in everything and they made us feel as if we were their most important client. We will definitely use Nadia and her team for any other buying or selling transactions in the future.</review>< Pictures>

Our move was especially difficult due to the fact that I was nine months pregnant and we hadn’t found a new home to buy!

<text>We have been looking for the right coastal home for quite sometime.  We were introduced to Nadia by a friend who said she is such a "go getter" and is definitely "in the know" of properties on the coast.  Our friend was so right.  Nadia helped our family find the perfect home for us.  She was with us every step of the way working with the builder and ultimately finding us the right fit.  We couldn't be happier with Nadia:)<//text>< time>

<Review>“A lot goes into home buying, who knew!? Nadia Colucci & Anne Benitez - that's who! Nadia came highly recommended from some friends of ours in North County. We met with her and began searching for our first home. She helped us sell a condo we inherited and made the transition to buying our first home very smooth. We felt so lucky to have her and Anne available to answer our many questions and address both my wife and I’s individual needs throughout the process.
We always felt that they did a great job with negotiations and thoroughly explained the many facets of the process to both my wife and I. Our new place in Cardiff is exceeding our expectations every day and we look forward to raising our son here in the North County at last!”</Review><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

Anne and Nadia are nothing short of a dream team! I can’t express how much easier they made the moving process for us. We had contingencies, young kids, and very specific needs that they accommodated and worked around, all while getting us top dollar for our property. If you want realtors that you can trust ethically and professionally look no further. And the cherry on top? You’ll actually have a lot of fun with them along the way!< /text>

Some of the most knowledgeable and hard working realtors we have ever come across.  Our first experience was so great with North Compass Realty that we didn’t even think twice to contact them for our second home purchase.  They always make themselves available to assist you (even months after closing).< /Text>

Amanda and I could not have been more pleased with the advice, accessibility, and professional service provided by Anne and Nadia.  This was our first home purchase and we had a million questions about all the mysteries of real estate.  With such a large investment, we really had our guard up, but quickly realized that was not required with Anne and Nadia.  At every step, their advice was in our best interest.  They gave us honest feedback and supported us when we had to lean hard on the sellers to meet our purchase needs.  Having them both work in tandem was great, we never waited more than a few minutes for an answer to a question.  We cannot wait to recommend Anne and Nadia to friends or to hit them up for our next purchase.< /Text>

The circumstances of my first home purchase had me making the decision to go with the same realtors chosen by the seller, North Compass Realty. Nadia and Anne were great...knowledgeable, attentive, available and persistent in getting me through my short escrow. Most importantly, I felt they were looking out and working for my best interests as well as the sellers.< /Review>

<review>They are horrible, they ask you to sign in , told you are second in line, and then people walk in go to the front desk.and they took 4 people in front of my fiance when we were here just to pick up.shoes.. very poor customer service and attitudes.. highly do not recommended. All young people with no manners. Go.elsewhere!

Friar tux was incredible!!! Theyve never failed me from the very first time i used them for my highschool prom til now my wedding. We told them what we were looking for in terms of color scheme and style and they hit the nail right on the head. Took care of my groomsmen and myself very well. Everything was in order and their process made everything much easier. Thank you friar tux once again look forward to using you guys again in the future.< /Review>

The Torrance Store was super quick getting my son fitted for his tux.  When he went to pick it up, the shoes were too big and they ordered another size for him.  I thought that was really nice with one day to go before prom.  Then, my son left his wallet in his jacket when we returned the tuxedo.  Friar Tux called and let us know that the wallet was there.  And, they kept it in a drawer with other "found" items.  Very impressed.</review>

If I could leave zero stars I would. This is the worst experience of my life tied to the most important day of my career. 5 months in advance my 2 sins and I were fitted for tuxes for my first red carpet of my film making career.  2 days before the event I go in to do the final fitting to discover they have lost both my sons measurements, so they don't get the tuxes they ordered and my tuxes was completely sized wrong including children's pants. What a joke! Thanks for ruining the best day of my life!!!<//Review>

A solid place for tux rentals. It was truly a painless experience getting ready for my friend's wedding. I arrived, gave the store clerk my name and the wedding couple's names, and they were able to start my fitting immediately. They knew what they had specified, and had me try on the appropriate items. I paid up front, but I think you have the option to pay later as well. 3 days before the wedding I was able to pick up the Tux, it fit great, and I was ready to go for my friend's wedding. I had to drop it off the next day, which was a bit of a hassle because I had to work and have someone else drop it off. Otherwise they charge a hefty late fee.</text>

I normally rent a tux/suit 2-3 times a year, primarily for school functions (I'm a teacher) However my last visit was for my impromptu wedding near Las Vegas. I  rented two suits for my wedding but also needed to stop in the Las Vegas branch to pick up something for my son. This is where I noticed the difference between the Torrance shop and others. While the Torrance branch may not be the most energetic (reason why I rate a 4) they are highly competent in what they do. I have never experience one error or false expectations from Torrance.</text>

We ordered and paid a few weeks before the date and picked up the day before and dropped off the day after. The building is really small but they have quite a lot of merchandise and since they are a chain they can get whatever size you need from the other stores if they don't have it in stock.<//review>< Pictures>

Had the displeasure of going into this place today to get myself and all my groomsmen fitted and measured for suites for my wedding in April.  For whatever reason all my groomsmen including my soon to be father in law and my own father were called ahead of me as well as the people that walked in after I did.  The manager/employee who’s name I can’t remember but she has short hair and glasses, looked at me and asked have you been helped yet when she knew I was the groom and had to be taken care of first since we are paying for everything, but no!!!!

I’m 6ft tall and have a bodybuilders build, broad shoulders, big chest and a wide back.  She looked at me and said

“we don’t have anything that fits you, we will have to mix and match”.

Are you jokIng!?!

“come back on Wednesday but in themeantime I’ll measure your neck”  then she hands me a dirty shirt which is 3 sizes too big to try on like she’s doing her job or something.  I wanted to put a stop to everything right then and there.  I told her I’ll never do “suit separates” mix and matching for my wedding isn’t something I would ever do on a regular day much and I for sure don’t plan on starting on my wedding.  Now I have a sour taste in my mouth and have to go to my regular suit place in the valley that actually makes quality suits and doesn’t brush you off especially when you brought them 10 people in 1 freaking day!!!!

I honesty don’t want anyone getting suited here from my party but it’s too late to mess around now.  Big dudes beware of this place..  call ahead to find out if they have something for you before you make the drive from the valley to deep Torrance for over an hour in traffic< /review>

I've been renting Tuxs at least twice a year in more than ten(10) years here for my singing recitals. All employees have been nice and friendly. They kept all my records here, so I have no trouble renting what I need and they have a lot to choose without repeating same outfits. Thank you very much.</review>

We loved the suit we rented for our wedding and the ones our wedding party bought. They were easy to work with and the prices were posted, not a negotiation trick like others.</text>

I went to Friar Tux with my son for his prom rental. Time is short so we were hoping that this place is going to be  a breeze. It was... but only because the sales guy (with beard) was not in the mood to help us. Even my teenage son recognize his poor customer service . He tried to defend him that he looked sick... Sick or no sick he has to do his job. I was not happy to be let out the door without even trying anything....
We got the Tux rented an hour later at the competitor in Redondo for  half of your price.<//Text>

They handed us chips and we waited about 30-40 minutes total while another guy, who showed up 5 minutes after we showed up, ordered his food from scratch and left with a good sized bag of food (And no, this guy didn’t call ahead of time.

This spot is an absolute gem. The most delicious, authentic food. Worth the wait and the staff is so friendly.

I ordered the shredded beef enchiladas and they did not disappoint.

10/10 recommend.<//text>

We eat here too much. Lol. I always get the fajita style burrito and my husband gets the mojado burrito with shredded beef. The kids get tacos and enchiladas. Their delivery is surprisingly fast too! And the size of the dishes are incredible! We always have leftovers! Highly recommend!</Text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I use to have decent service there, but the food made up for that decent to below average service. But the other day ago the service from at least 3 employees was horrible. I'm very easy to be satisfied in restaurants but they really were bad the other day. My wife and I were waiting for our food outside and we had to go get out drinks, needed some extra salsa and had to ask the waiter 3 times for it and we finally had to go get it ourselves. All the while another customer who came in after us had a waiter come back and forth to them multiple times getting them everything they needed, I think they knew one another. I'll try them one more time because I do like their food but if the service is the same I'll stay away. It's funny how not to long ago I was doing orders on the phone for take out as that's all they could do because of covid19 and they thanked me over and over for helping them  keep the business open from my patronage on take out orders. How soon they forget about what keeps them open.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I’ve been here thrice and we all love them. Quick service, friendly staff, homey ambiance, and very awesome food! Their fish and shrimp tacos are to die for. They’re reasonably priced. Also, if you ever decided to get a burrito, be prepared to devour a massive one or have another meal the next day if you take it to go. I highly recommend their tacos.< /review>

We used to always come here for the amazing service. Who ever made changed here recently made the wrong ones. Lack of service girls are always on there phones instead of helping customers. Food lacked any flavor and way way way overpriced. Heed our word and go to a food truck for good food.<//text>

The food is amazing.  Got the carnitas plate and it was absolutely delicious.  Very generous portions (I'm taking some home from work) and very quick service.  Was greeted right away by friendly staff and a warm environment.  Absolutely making this place a staple.<//Review>

I've been to this place numerous of times usually get the bean and cheese burrito combo to go. Very good quality food. Tortilla chips and salsa are addictive. The cook greeted me when I entered. Also got my order started and was finished by the time I paid. Very welcoming. I appreciate places like this. Thank you Burrito Grill staff for making my day.<//Review>

This is our go to Mexican restaurant, even though we now live a ways from it. The food is outstanding, the service excellent! We have eaten at this site, the Seal Beach and Long Beach one-all are great! The quality of all they serve is outstanding! We also often order their long burritos for parties and are always a great hit!< /Text>

Nice little place. Great food. Prices are okay. Food is always fresh. Parking can be a little rough to get into since it is right after a streetlight but once you find it you'll always be prepared to head off the greenlight slow to immediately turn into the parking lot right across the street.</text>

<text>Disregard all the negative reviews this place somehow acquired.  I was hungry and looking for a nice place to eat. You can take my word for it this place is exceptional! I am an American Soldier,  and throughout my travels there is no finer place for an authentic Mexican meal.  The service was excellent.  I was greeted fast and with a smile.  I received my meal and the portions were big, and I can eat too, so the sheer fact that I could not finish it all was amazing. Usually places that serve large portions, it's of lesser quality.  I assure you this is not the case here.  The rice and beans were delicious. Come here to stop your hunger!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Crazy selection! I recommend the avocado burrito. Yum! The place could use some sprucing up, but it's otherwise good eats. One tip: Don't wait for them to bring your check or you'll be there forever. Head to the register when you're done and they'll have it there.</review>

Staff is very welcoming,  even the kitchen staff says hello.
This place has my family hooked, they request El Burrito at least once a week.
Call in your order and pick up in 10 minutes.
Excellent Food.</Review>

Authentic Mexican food. Owner is nice and inviting. Chile Colorado is one of my favs for dinner. Bean and cheese burrito is also good for  lunch.<//review>

SO GOOD! Only down side is the fact that they serve the plates SUPER hot. It always burns my fingers and by the time I'm ready to leave, the plate is still lukewarm. Other than the hot plates, I love the food and the people are nice.< /Review>

Asada burrito was tasty, chunks of steak were cooked well, bit messy and less firm than most places (mine came with guacamole). You also get some tostados and salsa which are also fresh and delicious.  My only critique is no red sauce, limes, and pickled carrots, onions, etc. you get standard at most places.   Can't wait to try out the rest...<//text>

<review>This place used to be real good, but their service and food was so bad. I got a shrimp burrito and the shrimp was gritty and tasted like it had sand in it and was under cooked. I couldn't tell the waitress because she was never around. I finally told the server at the counter and he made a stupid joke and started laughing! Eating bad food is no joking matter! It is a good thing I didn't get sick off of the shrimp. I have never encountered such poor service.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>5 Stars for food quality and price.  The waitress / hostess / Uber eats order fulfiller had way too much work to do. She was constantly building orders 4 food delivery or pick up and barely paying attention to customers inside the restaurant. This is just another way for a restaurant to make an extra buck and abuse their employee. Expect the same amount of service as you would going to Togo's or McDonald's.  It's one thing to have a hostess also be a waitress, and have downtime when the internal customers are all gone. It's complete other thing to ask the only hostess / waitress to also fulfilll pick up orders when she's got a full restaurant to tend to.</text>< Pics>

<Text>Went out on a limb with these guys and I can honestly say not happy at all.. their hours say theyre open at 9am but they didn't open until 10:15 this morning, service is less than desirable as they aren't friendly at all.. ordered a breakfast burrito with no chorizo and it came with no chorizo but also no bacon!!! Salsa was good with the chips they give but overall not much better than Del taco to be honest.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Sorry but this is one of the worst places I have ever eaten. Hands down The most tasteless tacos ever. The salsa is mild ketchup tasting and no flavor at all. Big clue to FAKE mexican food is any place called "Grill".
My wife is Mexican and we eat only real food. This place is one step above the worst of the worst places I.e. Pokito Mas, Baja Fresh etc..</text>< Pictures>

<Text>I would say that El Burrito Grill is right on par with other Mexican food places of similar quality and price range (Super Mex, Baja Sonora, etc). While I did thoroughly enjoy my food, it's not the closest Mexican food to my house so I wouldn't go out of my way to get some, but I would absolutely consider them if I'm out and want a really good burrito.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>This is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food. When I worked nearby, the Special C (2 bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, plus a medium drink) was a lifesaver, at only 5 bucks. Their burritos are great and a good size, but what keeps me coming back even when I live half an hour or more away is the shredded beef tacos. I'm not sure what it is, but every time I want tacos, El Burrito Grill's are the ones I crave. Also, the owner's usually there, making sure people like the food and are enjoying their meals. He always seems like he's working as hard as his employees are, which gains a lot of respect from me.
Oh! The chips and salsa are also amazing; for takeout orders they give you an amazing amount (like they don't want any empty space in the bag, even on the cheaper orders), the chips are tostada style, and their salsa is hotter than most other restaurants yet so good I'd rather finish my drink than stop eating it.
Overall, this is where I go whenever I'm in the area, and even still I'll sometimes drive out to Long Beach just to go here.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Sean S</user_name></record>

The food here is really good, but the service is awful and the pricing is a bit much. Like they charged me extra for extra meat they didn't even give me and charged way too much for an addition of verde salsa.<//Review>

<text>HORRIBLE customer service! The person behind counter seemed irritated that I asked for help with locating an item.  Needless to say, I'm able to buy the same item at a different store with better customer service.

Business owners need to remember that the customers keep them in business.< /text>< Pictures>

THE BEST INDIAN GROCERY STORE. I love this place. It is clean, nice, and the owner is very friendly and helpful. All the stuff is fresh and nicely setup. The range and variety of products is big. The prices are competitive and some items are cheaper than the bigger stores like walmart, winco and costco. We shop atleast once a week from this place. It is right in Roseville near my home so I don't have to go too far to do my groceries. Overall it is a great place at a convenient location and the staff is wonderful.</Text>

Meat was good, price fair and friendly service. Bbq sauce tasted like pancake syrup. Very strange. Will probably go here again but definitely try different sauce choice. They have a few varieties. Don't choose sweet!! Gross<//Text>

<name>Justin Sweet< /name><Text>I placed an online order at 615 PM, they said it would be done at 630, showed up at 630 and was instructed to sit and wait. At 645 an employee came out and asked what order was mine, I told him and he then started making my food. During that 15 minute window three other customers that were walk ins were helped, served, paid, and left. At 655 they handed me a greasy bag (because they didn’t change there gloves from making the food to bagging it, or between orders) without my drinks, no plastic ware, no napkins, no sauce that I ordered, and missing an item. The food was gross as well. The worst $28 I have ever spent on food. I never leave reviews but this experience blew my mind. Also the ice cream machine didn’t work, and none of the sodas worked either so the only option was the tea or lemonade.< /Text>< GmapID>

Sunday's kids eat free with a purchase of a meat plate. This is something that is great for parents. Kids can enjoy mac and cheese, nuggets, and a diverse selection of sides.  Plus free ice cream for the kids too. My main reason for the low review is because i was not impressed with the quality of the food.  I admit my opinion is biased. I am from North Carolina where I've had some of the best barbeque, sides, and sauces. Not to mention I've been to Kansas!  Personally, I would spend $12 somewhere else to enjoy a better meal.< /Text>

<Text>3 times in a row we have gone into Dickey’s at around 8pm and they have been out of something we wanted to order. First time, it was no fries, no pork
Second time it was no brisket
Third time it was no chicken, no chili beans, no mac n cheese.

Each time it appeared as if they were getting ready to close and were getting a head start on washing dishes by placing products in disposable containers. It seemed as if they just didn’t want to cook more because they just wanted to get out early upon closing. I highly doubt that a BBQ restaurant would frequently be out if main dish products.

This gives such a bad image to such a great company with great food. The one star rating is for the disappointments we have experienced. I almost don’t want to go back because it will most likely continue to be a recurring issue.

The restaurants down the street never have this problem, so we went to one of them instead.

Good luck and wish you the best Dickey’s!< /Text>< Pictures>

About 2pm, Monday: after lunch time, so the restaurant was nearly empty. Had charred brisket, which was tender, juicy, and delicious. Sides of cabbage slaw, pretty good, and mac and cheese, flavorless. Would I go back? Absolutely, just wouldn't order mac and cheese. Great value; great service. Could hardly finish the brisket. The barbecue sauce was also very tasty.</review>

Came in after being disappointed in the past thinking we would give them another chance being this is the only bbq joint in Hanford. Food quality definitely needs to be reevaluated as my husband got a two meat plate and his meat was cold. I got a sandwich plate and had more fat in my pulled pork than meat and the bun on top was full of grease which im assuming was from the greasy glove from touching the meat...gross!!! BBQ sauce station was dirty and sauces were almost empty at this was at 6pm peak dinner hours</Review>

I have been to this place at least four times to make sure I didn't just catch them on a bad day. No matter what I ordered each time it was a disappointment. The brisket was way too fatty and chewy, and just no flavor. I tried the trip tip with the same results. Not sure if they are using low quality meats, or it is a cooking issue. Their prices are not cheap, so one would expect some quality, but I will not be returning.<//Text>

Food was ok but the restaurant was filthy and was quite disorganized.  No ice cream either, one of the main reasons for going there. I highly advise anyone to think twice before eating here.< /text>

Ugh. The food was cold. Not worth it what so ever. Maybe it's because I'm from the south. But don't waste your money. If you want good BBQ make the drive to Fresno, hit up famous Dave's. It's well worth it. It was pathetic how bad the food was<//Text>

<Text>Good food with a variety of sides. Love the ice cream machine! Can make a Root Beer float with the on-site soda machine :) The Giant Baker (a huge baked potato with all the toppings) is to kill for!

Wrong order. The employees don't care about  quality  as they filled up the new BBQ sauce in dirty container that had dirty water in it from the warmer. Had to tell them 3 times that it was not acceptable and a health issue. Very unhappy this time.</text>

Its a okay place to go,its pricey but what can you expect when your trying to eat pull pork  etc ,the meat tasted good the biscuit was cold and and fries tasted oily like they were recook, the floor look a bit dirty like it was sticky,also what's up with the workers on the phone next's to the soda machine i dislike the fact they are on the phone cause they are dealing with food,the ice cream machine looks really really questionable it looks unmaintain and dirty i got a potato with meat and sour cream and in some parts it was good some parts it was crumbly like old or not cook right other then that i will not go there again will just not the one in Hanford 2 stars only< /Text>

My first time here. Smelled good. I ordered the 3 meat plate. It was good till I started biting into fat. A third of the meat that I got was fat. $19 with a drink. It's overpriced I definitely won't be back< /review>

Nothing out of the ordinary. Pretty much your standard pulled pork or BBQ beef. The sauces are not my style so I just used my own at home. And I definitely do not like any of the sides. I'd rather go to Pismo Beach  for great BBQ and sides.<//Text>

The deals they text out and the military discount are amazing. I have been from south Florida all the way out here and this is the best BBQ I’ve ever tasted. The brisket and ribs are to die for< /Review>

Placed a large order and did not receive two of the items ordered. The staff was other wise friendly and helped with making the order transition smoothly.<//Review>

My husband visited this store today, 12/17/18 at 5:55pm. My husband ordered his own meal and he bought me my own meal me with pulled pork and a side. He brought our meals home and honestly I have NEVER been to an establishment that is so careless when it comes to not only their quality but their customer service. I am beyond baffled. In my pulled pork I found a huge piece of rapped surran wrap and wasn't paying attention and put this piece of plastic in my mouth thinking it was a normal piece of pulled pork. I ended up calling Hanford Dicky's and the man I was on the phone with put me on hold for OVER TEN MINUTES. ARE YOU KIDDING ME ANNND HE DIDNT EVEN TELL ME HE WAS PUTTING ME ON HOLD. ARE YOU SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME?! It doesn't end there. Since I had to hang up, I tried to recall but the phone was off the hook. So I drove myself to the location and unsurprisingly was face to face with the man who carelessly ditched my phone call and put me to the side. TO TOP IT OFF he tried to make an excuse as to why he didn't get back to me on the phone. He claims to have been busy with his whole 5 customers in the entire store. He was unapologetic AND he was also unprofessional AND RUDE. Instead of actually being genuine, he decided to treat me like I was a nuisance. He refunded me and rudly placed my reciept on the counter and rudly walked away. I used to really enjoy coming to this fast food business; however, this will be the LAST time I will ever set foot in this disrespectful, careless and poorly ran business.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I just went to Dickeys to get a rib plate. Almost noone was there. When I came in there was a caucasian Male who walked up already looking upset and tired. I asked for a rib plate. He told me there were out. I replied aw man really and he looks me in the face and  in the most disrespectful way say YEA. I wouldn't be this upset normally but everytime I come to the dickeys restaurant in hanford I deal with his bad customer service and this is the last time I will be visiting this establishment. I'm a military man and i even if i wasn't people deserve more respect than that!< /Review>

<text>A great playground for children of pretty much all ages. The park has something for everyone, from a little but still fun rock climbing wall with spots of various difficulties, swings (for much very small children and normal swings), sand, structures, slides and more.< /text>< pics>

On the weekend, families are BBQing on the grills and having a family event at their tables .
Usually on the weekdays in the mornings you will see Nannies and children on the playgrounds. Its a safe area.
There is a school across the grass area also. Hope you all come out to enjoy the beautiful family friendly park soon. Thank you</text>< Pictures>

Food is pretty good, prices not so much. There are plenty of great Pho restaurants in the SF/East Bay offering fare of equal quality and far greater quantity. Spent $62 on two clam shells of noodles, half a container of calamari (a $10 container of calamari cleverly packed with wedge of lime INSIDE the box) and three beverages. Not particularly budget friendly -- head up the road to Super Super Pho for great food, relaxed atmosphere and awesome staff.<//Text>

Got two bowls of pho and it was rough. Meat was super tough, oxidized... smelled funny. Broth was good but that was a total deal breaker for me.< /Review>

<Text>I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and vegetables, and honestly it was kind of a bland, soggy mess.
The pan fried noodle came to me as an enormous patty, cut into quarters that were each as big as my hand. With no knife at the table or provided with the meal, I basically set those aside and ignored them. It's probably just as well since they were dripping oil.
The broth and meat were amazingly bland. I could not detect flavors of herbs, meats, spices, or even salt while eating. Considering how amazingly fresh the place smells when you walk in, it's kind of a shock that they could make such lifeless dishes.
The wait staff was friendly enough.

Not going back.<//Text>< Pictures>

The person at the register didn’t know the menu, I specifically said well done brisket and well done flank and he gave me something completely different and said that the well done brisket and well done flank were not on the menu. They were unable to change it because they closed right after. Now I have rare meat in my food (which I can’t eat) and the money I spent is wasted. Next time study your menu.</Review>

<Text>Had a great experience the Pho was delicious, staff is very kind and friendly. One thing that stood out to me was the size of the bowls. The offer large or small and I could not tell the difference between the two. If you want to save 1 Dollar and get big meal, just go for the small one. I think the staff even get confused by the bowl size cause I swear it was a large one but I paid dollar less.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

Extremely flavorful and delicious Pho! The only con is I always have to order 2 Large bowls to feel satisfied since they give such small portions of noodles.

Attentive and nice servers! Overall 5 Stars.</text>< time>

<review>This is my favorite Pho restaurant. I come here at least once a week and get #67 vegetarian pho. It's absolutely delicious and the broth is subtle but delicious. And I love the staff, they are always so friendly and welcoming! Highly recommend!<//review>< rating>

<review>I've eaten here several times and brought friends. The food is very good. I like the broken rice dishes and the vermicelli salads. I especially like the fresh-made drinks, such as the carrot-orange juice. This last visit made me wonder about the Asian middle-aged male waiter, whom I don't think I've seen before. He hung around the table next to me, where 3 men ate lunch. He asked them whether they worked at a nearby tire store, whether business was good, whether they were working especially hard now, etc. It seemed a little forward. When my bill arrived, I remember thinking about how I'd pay the $22.94 owed. I thought I won't leave $25 because the change would not be enough to cover a tip. I decided to leave $40, two $20 bills. I definitely looked at the two bills (I keep $20 bills together, $10 together and $5 together). The waiter scooped up the money the instant I put it on the little plastic tray. He gave me $2 and 6 cents change. He left, so I frantically talked to a waitress who was eating her lunch. I explained I was given change for $25, not $40. She very nicely gave me $17 to make up for the missing change. Then the middle-aged guy returned and said assertively, "You left a $20 bill and a $5 bill; I double checked.'" I was sure I hadn't made such a mistake, but he insisted I did, so I felt resigned to losing $17. When the guy left out the back for a reason unknown to me, the waitress who had reimbursed me $17 said all was fine and I could leave. If that middle-aged waiter takes your money, be sure you get the right change.<//review>< pics>

Blown away!! Swung by for a quick bite and it was ready in no time.  Service was welcoming and no nonsense. Best Pho I've had in a long time (maybe ever). Good beer on tap and good prices. Nuff said.< /text>

I eat there almost weekly. Best pho I know. Great appetizers and a variety of mains to choose from. Friendly familiar staff. Great drinks. Really nothing bad to say. It's exactly what I'm looking for when I go for Vietnamese.<//Review>

I love this place. The large is only $1 more so I always get it. Sure it is a little difficult to pour it into the to-go container, but so worth it. The pho is delicious and fresh and the staff is friendly. There is not a whole lot of seating or street parking so I always get here before noon to beat the rush.

If you leave early and beat the rush, this is a great lunch option that is super reasonable for the area!<//Review>

Solid basic Vietnamese and Southeast Asian food. Very good Pho soup, which is mostly what we go there for. Nice large, open space, good to bring the kids, and they always have had tables quickly available.< /review>

<Review>This is a family favorite...one can relax and enjoy your delicious fried noodle salad, amazingly filling soups (and yummy!), and so far, anything else ordered from the menu!  Service is VERY polite and courteous...and parking is...heck be patient and drive around the block a few times, its worth it!  Thank you people at Le Pho!  😁😋< /Review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Had the catfish spring rolls and no 27 chicken pho. One of each is enough for two. Excellent. Highly recommend and I give out very few five star reviews.</Review>

Pho at Oriental on Shattuck at Delaware heaps better. Cheaper, much more generous with all veggies. Tastier broth. So if pho is your thing go to Oriental. Don't know about other items on the menu here. Also constant blarring TV.</Review>

Probably the worst Vietnamese food I’ve had. I split two vegetarian dishes (Hu Tieu and the pho Chay). Maybe it was just the vegetarian dishes, but the flavors seemed off and muted/bland. Also game show playing on the tv worsened the atmosphere, which is otherwise nice.

However service was very quick, the vegetables were good quality and the fresh spring rolls were great.</review>

The people are really friendly and I wanted to like the food, but that was not to be.  I only ordered the pho, but if that is any indication, this restaurant needs to fix its cooking or it will die.  I hope the manager or owner is reading this and will take action.  The pho broth could not in any way be called a beef broth.  It looked more like chicken, though weak even for that.  The flavor was utterly bland, and lacking the traditional pho flavors of burnt onion, burnt ginger, anise, clove, and good fish sauce, not to mention any hint of beef.

It's not that hard to prepare.  Boil beef bones, preferably marrow bones, for a couple of days or in a pressure cooker for half a day, add the ingredients described above except for the fish sauce, cook an hour or two more, get rid of the fat, strain, and you have the broth, ready for fish sauce to be added to get just the right salt balance and the final secret weapon of flavor.  Wild fennel is sprouting up around here all over the place now, and the fresh new greens add wonderful flavor for savvy cooks who want to reap the seasonal rewards nature offers up gratis.

Serve with plenty of fresh basil, cilantro, sliced onion and green onion, and sliced green fresh hot peppers for the heat lovers (traditionally, bean sprouts are served with pho too, but I think they detract from the flavor and so I feed them to my dogs, who are very appreciative).  So easy, really.  Most places around here make nice pho broths (check out, among many others, Phuong Nam, Mekong, and Le Cheval, all in Oakland) but Le Pho needs to learn.<//Text>

Very stingy when serving foods ordered with meat. They will sprinkle just one or two morsels of it on top of the rice or noodles. A rice bowl with 1 sliver of chicken is not worth $12.<//review>

Staff was super nice, friendly and attentive. Food came out rather quickly and was hot. Lots of good choices on the menu which made it hard to decide. Lasagna was uber good and everyone else enjoyed their dinners. I recommend Viney's if you are hungry and in Sonora.</text>< pictures>

We just stumbled upon it while visiting sonora. It was so good. Nice wait staff. Pretty and relaxing atmosphere. Delicious food. And even had champagne. Will definitely go back.</text>

<text>I was really excited about their Greek pizza and curry chicken pizza. It was a bit disappointing. The sauces for both didn't really pop. Greek was pesto. The ingredients didn't really pop either for me. I honestly preferred their cheese pizza more because the red sauce was actually pretty good. I would suggest trying their red sauce pizzas<//text>< Name>

However, my mom ordered the TURKEY panini and the meat smells and looks nothing like turkey i don’t even know what kind of meat it is 🤢
I ordered baked ziti, it was ok. But the real issue is with these tiny little pieces of cakes that cost $7 each! I will never order from vineys again.<//text><rating>1<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Terrible service with DoorDash. They gave me boiling hot tomato sauce in thin plastic container and thin paper bag. Once I arrived to customer I took the bag out the lid was not on and it spilt all over the car and onto myself and burned my skin. When I called this restaurant to try to get another order or something, they claimed it was my fault as a doordasher then hung up. When I called back THEY THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE. I was completely calm when talking to them, but my voice was shaken because of the burning mess all over my lap.
Never again 👎 😡😷</review><user>112748960790602472500<//user>< Response>

You were using F language with restaurant staff and threatening them to comeback and break the door, thats when staff decided to call the police. You made 9 calls to the restaurant staff cussing at them. The customer was a regular customer and we called and apologized.\nIt was soup not tomato sauce.'}< /Response>

<Review>What's not to love about Vineys. The food and service is great. I was on vacation and stopped in and was happy to find this little place. Our waitress was Brianna. She was so sweet and such a great waitress, very prompt and helpful. we had the Saffron Salmon Picata. WOW. Delicious fresh and tasty. We will be back.</Review><gmap_id>0x8090c5dea0525901:0x6e19570559c810bd< /gmap_id>< response>

Check your items before you leave. The cook burnt our pizza and knowingly still sent it out.  When we called the cook said quite loudly in the background it was only half. They offered a discount for the next time. But the fact that you knowing did that was disappointing. You have to turn pizzas in the oven to avoid burning them. Please choose quality, your customers deserve that, and I believe had we eaten in the restaurant it would have been approached differently.</Text>

I felt Viney's is more of a pizza kitchen than a restaurant as compared to other Italian restaurants. Staff did a good job serving the large party. I'm not familiar with what other options are available in Sonora.  Probably a place I'd recommend for having a pizza and beer vs an Italian dish with fine wine. Atmosphere was more pizza parlor than restaurant.</text><UserId.>105364190034336086821< /UserId.>< Pics>

I’m really sorry to say but my meal was revolting. I ordered spinach ravioli and Alfredo sauce. Which sounds lovely but was so so full of garlic it made it inedible. My husband swopped his pizza with me as luckily he smokes 6 cigars a day and has lost most of his taste buds. There was only one other couple in so I can’t put down the food to being overwhelmed or super busy, I won’t recommend it.< /review>

WOW! I just found out about this restaurant today!  My friend had told me about Vinny's so we met for lunch and I can say: the Pizza was awesome,  the wine very nice and the service is 5 star +.  I highly recommend Vinny's! They have Lasagna and other Italian dishes and everything looks incredible!  They have an area to seat a group. They MAKE their own Pizza Crust...no preservatives...you can taste the difference.  I can't wait to take my Husband to Vinny's for bite!  It would be a great for date night!  YES! I reccomend Vinny's ❣</Review>

This place has a good variety of dishes. There are many options for vegetarian diners and also some gluten-free choices!

I ordered a build your own pasta with penne and a garlic pesto sauce. It was pretty good, but I'll request more sauce next time. It reminded me of Olive Garden a bit. I went late in the evening and have a feeling that earlier would have been better/fresher. The breadstick that came with my meal didn't do anything for me, but maybe I'm just picky. It was a bit dry.

The prices seem a little high, but not unreasonable. I expected a larger portion or higher quality for the 14.95 price. There are refills given on the fountain drinks (which include non-sodas like the delightful pink lemonade I had).

Overall not bad, and it's nice to have an Italian place nearby. I do plan on going again earlier in the day and trying the pizza or calzone.< /Text>

Waited for 45 minutes for a half burned stuffed pizza. No apology, no drinks comped for our time. I wish I had taken a photo. Will not be returning.</Text>

I was told about this place by a good friend of mine ...they just opened a new location in Victorville California and we are sitting here at the table now and I couldn't wait to make my review because everything she told me about this place was exactly as she described ...amazing food and amazing service if you haven't tried them in Rialto but you live in the high desert  or on your way to Vegas you have to stop and try them on 7th Street...

<review>The BEST meat ever!  I have consistently visited this location in the last year and they have not disappointed. The customer service is wonderful, the efficacy of delivering my order as requested is always on point. And the flavor of their tortas ahogadas is superb.

This is a really great Mexican restaurant. Inside is beautifully decorated with lots of new and old pictures of Mexico. The waitress is extremely friendly and very efficient. When the food arrived we were blown away. The fajitas combo was excellent! The tacos were great and the lighter-colored red salsa is smoking good! I would highly recommend to my friends and family.<//Review>

Salsa did not taste/look fresh.  Chips did not taste fresh (a bit chewy).  They store salsas in squeeze containers which makes me consider how often they actually clean those things.  I’ve being a customer for around 10 years or so and I’ve Seen a decrease in quality, significant increase on prices and less friendliness from the owners.  Fontana location is better.<//Text>

Good spot for a quick bite. The place is small so be Willing to wait for a table it gets busy sometimes. The service is good And fast. My kid got the pozole it was good not (made by my mom good though) lol I got the torta ahogadas which was fire in flavor and spice I recommend getting the salsa on the side cause it was so hot. . Will definitely be back it's close to home. Great service and very delicious food. There tacos are great. There Birria and breakfast platters are very flavorful.< /text>

<review>Awesome place, food is amazing if you’re looking for authentic Mexican food. I’m Mexican and stay away from Mexican restaurants because they do not meet my standards of good homemade Mexican food. But this place definitely meets my standards it’s the only Mexican food restaurant I go to. They specialize in the Torta Ahogada and it’s delicious. The pozole is really good too and also try the tacos de chicharrón amazing. Also the tejuino is really good, it’s a traditional Mexican drink. Finally the staff is super friendly and humble, they alway make you feel welcomed. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//review>< GmapID>

You want authentic Jaliciense cooking,  then you found the spot. The carne en su jugo is like your grandma made it. The birria is always on point, and of course the tortas ahogadas are perfect.  They use the salted rolls, just like back home❤. I've had tortas at other places,  but they are lacking.  I can eat here without worrying about heartburn or weird additives. Everything is fresh n delish<//Text>

<Text>Omg... this place is so good. My parents found this place and they loved it so much they brought me. I've been a few times now and everything I have had is delicious! Staff is great! Always welcoming. Ask for Brenda! I highly recommend the carne asada burrito with the red sauce. Be careful the sauce is very spicy!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The food is delicious. Good flavor and the customer service is great, they always check if you want something else with a smile. The location is too little and sometimes people have to wait to get a table. They have tacos, tortas, and weekends they have barbacoa, posole and menudo. Also the parking could be trouble because is on a busy place with many businesses around.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

The burritos are (i think) 5.75 each, but should cost 7.75 for how big they are! The cashier was really nice, and extremely beautiful. If i didn't live in Vegas, i would definitely come here for lunch everyday for the burrito, and cashier. Definitely recommend coming here for the burritos, but come early because the place is a little small< /Text>< rating>

Great experience. I felt very welcomed here and the food is delicious. I had a steak quesadilla with horchata on the side for a drink. They don't skimp on the cheese and steak and the horchata was a nice blend of sweet and mellow. Would come here again.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) For not being a culero I give them 3 stars. I wanted to give 1 star but they do ok I guess. The best cakes are in Los Angeles in the city of Monte Bello to be exact. CHAGO DROWNED !!! The best, the birote / bolillo 1000 kisses better than here, better meat, more flavor. Here they put very little beans, the bread gets soggy to the touch of the sauce, meat has no flavor, and just a disappointment. It is very sad that they lose the basics of the most basic food.

(Translated by Google) The corn tortilla should be stored in cloth pins and in an ice box and thus they will be better for reheating to go out to the client's table
Beans should have a little more flavor

(Translated by Google) Amazing people, amazing food. Authentic home style flavor from Guadalajara, Mexico.

The food is very good, its popularity says it all. The cakes are very rich, with the authentic salty roll of Guanatos, this place is like going to eat in Guadalajara without being able to leave the country, the mere net.

(Translated by Google) The service is fine, but they don't add enough beans to the drowned cakes, I know that if you want extra you have to pay and even ask for it, they don't give it to you every year that I come with my family on vacation to this state, we come but this is the last time I come to this place the next time we will go elsewhere.

(Original)
El servicio esta bien, pero a las tortas ahogadas no le hechan suficiente frijol yo se que si quieres extra tienes que pagar y aun lo pidas no te lo dan cada año que vengo con mi familia de vacaciones a este estado venimos pero esta es la ultima vez que vengo a este lugar la proxima vamos a ir a otro lado.<//Text>
