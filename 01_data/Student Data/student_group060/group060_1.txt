<Text>Cream was excellent! Great service on a busy summer night. Vegan options were plentiful, this was the Fudgin awesome sandwich with Mint Chocolate Chip Soy ice cream and Oreo crumbs. SUPERB! Best concept I've seen in awhile, they even changed gloves for my dairy concerns. 10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>They have a lot of different options for toppings and ice cream. And they had 2 lactose free options which was appreciated. Would be nice if there was a 2-3 more of those flavors. Staff were friendly and helpful when me and my friend were asking a million questions about the menu.< /Review>< Pics>

Ubered all the way down here because Google and Yelp said they close at midnight. Got here at 11:30pm Open sign is on, but no one is home... Guy outside said those are summer hours??? Yet it's Nov 30th, so plenty of time to update their hours.... Pretty lame</Review>

They've got ice cream in cups, build your own ice cream sandwich, waffle cones, waffle bowls and more.

< review>
Been to the Walnut Creek one. This location is not as nice. Maybe it was because it was close to 10 pm. The chocolate chip and the Mac nut white chocolate cookies were not warm and kind of tough as I bit into my Rocky Road ice cream sandwich. Plus, the Rocky Road was hard. Had to chew because the normally warm cookies would have soften the ice cream to bring out the flavors. Couldn't really taste the chocolate, marshmallows or nuts.

The price is the same at $3 without topping which is a great price if the custom-made ice cream sandwich was great.

Hubby liked his Banana Fosters ice cream sandwich. He could taste the bananas and caramel. His Mac nut cookies were barely warm too. Only saving grace - there was no line - since we were there late.</review>

< Review>
Fun idea of ice cream sandwiches where you can choose your cookies and ice cream. Liked that you can have different cookies on either side, and the cookies were pretty good, especially as they warm them up so the ice cream sort of melts, which is messy but delicious! Normally I find ice cream sandwiches too solid as the cookies are frozen too, so these were very good. The one negative of this store was the service though. One staff member, who took her sweet time about everything... It took us almost 20 mins to get served, and there was only one family in front of us. So while I like the idea of made to order ice cream sandwiches, I'd suggest they find a more efficient delivery mechanism!<//Review>

<review>I liked the variety of mix. However the staff were rude and hurried to take the next order before we got to choose (or even try a different flavor).

Also, if a sandwich ice cream wrapper falls off the hand on to the floor, please use a new one rather than dusting it off and using the same.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1531707269915, 'text': 'Hi Sridutt, thank you for the  3-stars rating.

<Review>I give them credit for the concept plus the smell of the cookies travels about a block each way so it is extremely tempting.  However, they have a few design issues to address.  The cookies are too hot and the ice cream too soft and it ends up being a mess by the third bite and only getting worse.  You cant really enjoy the experience when you are trying to eat and not have everything drip on you.  Perhaps, scoop the ice cream and give it a quick freeze and then place in between cookies or perhaps, lower the temperature of the cookies.  Just some thoughts.  Good concept, execution needs a little improvement<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Great cookies and ice cream. A great selection and it was quick as well. I got the Turtle Cookie (chocolate and peanuts... whole peanuts) and salted caramel ice cream. I loved the warmed up cookies and the icecream was good as well.

To the critics:

If it's too sweet, you're eating ice cream between two cookies. Enough said.
If you can't bite ice cream, man up (or woman up).
If the cookie flavor overtakes ice cream flavor, you chose the wrong combination. Try again. They didn't choose that combo for you.

To start, I can't really understand how anyone can give a place that serves cookie ice cream sandwiches less than 5 stars. So clearly I am biased. However, this place is not dishing out anything low quality - the cookies as amazing and super fresh, and the ice cream is top notch. Highly recommend the mini sandwiches so you can try a bunch of flavor combos. Or better yet, just eat a ton of full size ones... I am not going to judge you.< /text>

But the ambiance is great, especially later in the evening when there is often a decent sized queue.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1449561945762, 'text': "Hey Simon, thanks for sharing your recent experience with us.

<Review>With all the fuss that I have heard about Cream, it took me almost four years before I finally had my first.

Things to know,

It is now $4 for one ice cream sandwich and one topping is no longer included (will cost you $.75 each)
You can mix and match your cookies before they warm in the oven + 1 one ice cream choice
Suggest you split in half and share unless you have a huge sweet tooth

Overall Thoughts

While I am glad to have finally tried Cream, I do not forsee myself going back especially if there is a line</Review>< Pics>

The cookies are really soft bc they keep them half baked and then finish them in the convection oven when you order. The ice cream is really good and they have a variety of unique and classic flavors< /Text>

They only problem I had is the window cling for the store was advertising the Pina Colada combination that showed the coconut ice cream and fresh pineapple chunks. When I ordered it inside I got dried pineapple so they were just very sweet pieces of sugar. It would have been nice to have real, unprocessed fruit.</review>< rate>

<review>This was a fun place to go. The cookies used to make my sandwich were warm which was nice but also meant they fell apart while trying to eat the ice cream sandwich. Also most of the toppings added to my ice cream also fell off while eating.

So many choices, I was a bit overwhelmed.  I had churro flavor in between two brownies.  Very good.  I will definitely come here again to try'em all!< /Review>

The cookie was solid, but I can't say the vegan ice cream was that great. However, the rest of the family absolutely loved the standard cookies and cream w/ chocolate chip cookies as the sandwich.</Text>< Pics>

<text>They offer custom-made ice cream sandwiches. The cookie itself was nothing fancy. The ice cream was good, but not really up my alley, as I generally prefer my ice cream to have a melt-in-the-mouth feel. I guess that's just not possible with an ice cream sandwich... the ice cream would melt too quickly and it would just be one big mess. So Cream's ice cream is probably thicker and less melty on purpose.

I wouldn't wait in a long line for this, but I do love ice cream, so I might wander back in here sometime again.</text>< pics>

Heard good things about CREAM so I decided to try it and I was just around the area so decided to try it! Now for parking, you most likely will have to pay for parking as there are no free parking. Came in here and it was really beautiful setup they had. Felt like a ice cream parlor! Smelled like fresh baked cookies and that just made me want to eat my ice cream right away.

I ended up ordering the cin-ful churro and birthday cake ice cream after I tasted tested like half a dozen different flavors or course. Don't judge me! Also gf ended up getting cup of joe ice cream. Had to order some cookies also so I got Creamfetti (birthday cake  with confetti ) and double chocolate chip.

Now these flavors were so awesome I had to get the Cin-ful churro instead of my usual double birthday cake scoops so that means it was REAL good. It tastes just like a churro in ice cream form! Birthday cake was made correctly and just how it should be! Creamy and cake flavored!

Of course cup of joe was just like coffee and gf really liked it!

The two cookies I got was really good. Creamfetti was something I've never tasted which was birthday cake and made really well! Double chocolate chip was actually really good also. The best part of these cookies were soft and chewy and they were not hard at all. Don't forget to ask them to warm the cookies!

I would definitely come here if I had the chance to! fantastic place to come and have dessert! I'm just thinking about it at midnight when I'm so far away from it! Sad face</Text>

You know that irresistible aroma of fresh-baked cookies that flows in the air and wafts past your nose making you stop in your step and wonder, "where is that delicious scent coming from?" Yea, that's how Cream entices you into their store. I was able to resist the first time I came to the area, just buying Gong Cha and leaving. But when I came with my family, my sister was unable to resist the tempting aroma of cookies and made it her mission to get an ice cream sandwich cookie before we headed back to LA. And I followed her inside since the smell of cookies was just too amazing.

So Cream has a wide assortment of freshly baked cookies as well as a good number of ice cream flavors and toppings to do any sort of combination/creation that your heart desires. You can get cookies by itself, ice cream by itself, make an ice cream cookie sandwich, add toppings, make a premium ice cream cookie sandwich, make sundaes, make a taco (3 ice cream flavors and 2 toppings), purchase brownies, buy milkshakes, or get a coffee drink. Yep, the menu is pretty extensive. So if you want to make some sort of ice cream cookie concoction, chances are the workers at Cream will help you out.

I tried the butter sugar cookie on its own while my sister got a snickerdoodle salted caramel ice cream sandwich. The cookies individually weren't too expensive - like around a dollar or so for each, and they were taken right out of the oven! The butter sugar cookie was a bit of a let down in that it was way too sweet. I couldn't finish the entire cookie because the flavor was a bit too cloying. It reminded me a lot of the sugar cookies from Ralph's, which .. meh, are decent but not the best.

The moment I heard my sister order the ice cream sandwich, I knew she wouldn't finish it. And I was right! The combination was way too sweet. The snickerdoodle cookies were amazing. Still warm from the oven, it tasted like cinnamon and sugar - bliss! The salted caramel ice cream was also good - by itself. It's definitely nowhere near as good as Bi-Rite's. Mixed with the cookie and it was really sweet. And I like sweet things, but this was too much. We couldn't finish the cookie sandwich and had to toss some of it in the trash, which was really sad. However, price for this wasn't too bad - around $3-$4 and I think there was a check in offer.

tl;dr - Workers are fairly nice. This shop is definitely a good place to go if you're in the mood for a quick dessert or treat. Everything is clean, there are plenty of tables, the storefront is amazing, and the smell of cookies will draw you in! I would recommend trying the flavors of ice cream first before combining it with a cookie because these concoctions can get super sweet! I would just order cookies and ice cream separately, but that's just me. Glad I got to try Cream and it's good to know that there are locations in SoCal that I can easily visit. I rarely get a craving for ice cream, so if anything I will be back for the cookies!< /text>

<review>Tried for the first time today and my teenage daughters and I were impressed. Quick Burger is a healthy alternative to typical fast food and we didn’t feel that heaviness we do after eating the typical fast food. The sweet potato fries were delicious — crispy and flavorful. The russet fries were also crispy and the seasoning made them super tasty. The grilled chicken sandwich tasted homemade. Would recommend getting sauce (the guiltless aioli was yummy and lighter than expected). We’ll definitely be back!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

First of all it’s not quick at all  ( not even close )  super slow service and the burger 🍔 was horrible ( tastes like ampm’s burgers )  the fries 🍟 are pretty good ( kinda of limp ) but good flavor.  So anyways I ordered a double bacon cheeseburger 🍔 only got a single. And they forgot my drink   ( had 2 ask for it )   Really Bad customers service
They really need to find some people who know how to do their job. Definitely won’t be back.   Cool concept. Awful execution. Only reason I gave 2 ⭐️z  is because the fries 🍟  had a good taste</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfDdIDLDHv1wO20hnc1AeAieAe2CYYDjS3E2UW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLE6Bhia17AHWkwpkyM2jTDl0Dyz8fdf92-Cbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2S38LO8BiqCp5uJJCJDC7Uh86lA5UqW9wXxKj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcgidMGWJRz4og2i1fpbNoq6xqvzmO8Bj4ErMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6Prwjp1pMWXTVAU9C5LspOLKECZnzWSe_HVK0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpJEYD6U4xE6MklXYfbXTuMF5NNMQL0cFYeV7d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMolgWWlz4uF1fhMKAHD2REDQPq-jyUIEogMS0d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPenvZc5Ert2UTKR1GYdGt6T8sVKhbErmsfa5ku=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKz5iKnPLhq976z0cEVW1_6JVAVe7Yrl9E01B8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Rate>2</Rate>< gmapID>

Delicious Burgers, French Fries and can't forget the chocolate shake!

The ordering process is simple and you order/ create your own burger, recommend the sweet potato fries with the Aoli sause!

Customer Service was the best and can't wait to go back to Quick Burger for a delicious snack, definitely recommended ordering 2 burgers!< /review>

Just tried QuickBurger for the first time and LOVE it! I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was really great - super tender and juicy, and the fries were perfect. I can't believe they're cooked in an air fryer. I love that their food is healthier and fresher than other fast food places but tastes just as good, if not better. I also love the order system. I'll definitely be coming here often!<//Review>

We liked it.  A decent, inexpensive burger.  I used the walk-up kiosk and it worked very well (unlike some other places I've tried).  We'll definitely be back.<//Review>

it's not a dine in restaurant... NO CASH.. it's modeled after a Sonic.. drive through or walk up. patio dining or stay in your car..  Family owned and operated.   Nicest gentlemen you're ever gonna meet...  seriously  NO CASH.. its pay by card only.  ATM or Credit Cards.

I HIGHLY recommend trying this place...<//Text>

<review>The people who work here are just the nicest! The food is amazing every time we go. Yes, the ordering is different, but I think it’s fun to find new things! The French fries are air-fried and are honestly some of the best I’ve had. And the burgers are always made perfectly, especially with the aioli sauce. This is a great place to get a good meal, cant wait to go again.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Wish it had fresher lettuce. And, maybe more lettuce? I had 3 small pieces the size of a quarter. Overall the taste was okay. Will try it again just to see if maybe I was there on a day the cook was mad at someone? Not sure.< /review>

Their fries were actually pretty good and had a nice seasoning to them. The burger was a decent size and tasted really good.

I can’t believe how anyone could give this place a good review. It’s the worst burger I ever had. I don’t even think it’s meat. It was grey in color and I’m sure it was microwaved. I get sick just thinking of it and wondered how I ate it. Only because it had a tomato and mayo on it. Just close your eyes if you want to eat it.< /text>

<Review>PEOPLE THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST LITTLE BURGER JOINT AROUND!

I get it, people are gonna have opinions, they're gonna have their own experiences, and I have my own, and I just want to say regardless of the little things that people have experienced negatively that should not stop you from visiting this place.

I'm local and I have seen this place numerous times, I decided to stop in the other day and I must say I'm very impressed. I'm surprised it's not a little bit more popular sure the fries are a little interesting tasting, something to get used to, but everywhere is gonna be different, and for good reason, I was very impressed by the burger, the drink and the fries, and even the service

Don't just take my word for it and look at the other reviews I'm giving a 5 star review for a reason, and I'm telling you that I would recommend this to a friend and I recommend you give this place a shot, even though I visited one time, I would be a little sad to see this place, go out of business, so please do us all a favor and visit the joint?

I hope my review helps who ever sees this in the future, and if so, leave this comment I like 💜< /Review>< pictures>

Good food good prices. No cash accepted, no dine in. Drive through or take out only. Build order on the screen and pay by card, then pick up food when ready. Lettuce wrapped option, no gluten free bun.<//Text>

In line...  Everything is ordered by touch screen, seven burgers total...  Cash or card walk up kiosk...  Card only in the drive thru kiosk...  I get it, new place but they are not proficient on the register to handle cash transactions...  Was given the wrong change back and had to prompt them they owe me more money with no receipt...  The wait was very long and short of living up to the name Quick Burger... Still waiting...  Finally got my order...  Oh but wait, where is my shake...  SMH...

Food taste:
The burger was an alright burger for dinner...  A burger with all the fixings you can get... You'll have to try their fries and judge them for yourself...  Read the fine print how they cook the fries and have at it...  Must have them with an Aioli sauce or lite ranch or something to enjoy them...

Would I go back...?  Sure, why not...  Hopefully the cooks and register will have it together by then...

But would I ever crave it again to go back...?  Probably not, but worth a try...

All I can say is there's a new burger place in town...  Try it for yourself...  Good luck Quick Burger...</Text></record></dataset><record>

Excellent double hamburger!  Fresh and hot.  This is my second time here I really like it.  Got the fries this time and didn't like them. Im glad they don't add salt to the fries but they put too much of their spice mix on them.  I'll be back for more hamburgers!! Good prices also.</text>

Loved it! I built a cheese burger with the aioli, russet fries and vanilla shake.
Everything tastes fresh, not at all overly salty or greasy. I didn’t feel like I was in a bloated food coma afterward.

The shake was great, not too sweet and on the thinner side in consistency so easier to enjoy in my opinion. The fries were seasoned well and again, not salty or greasy. I’ll be back for sure!<//review>

We were excited to see Quick Burger is open so we stopped today to try it out. The touchscreen ordering and payment scheme were easy to use; offering many ways to satisfy individual preferences for this restaurants two offerings- hamburgers and grilled chicken sandwiches with French fries or sweet potato fries.

Service was good. When we took a few minutes to order; the staff came to the car to see if they could help. We ordered two burgers and two chicken sandwiches. Both were very good. The sweet potato fries were yummy but not hot or more than slightly warm. The cheese and sauces weren’t exactly as we ordered so only FOUR stars.

We’ll try them  again.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely no wait on a Sunday evening.  Ordered using a touch screen in the drive thru which isn't a problem if you understand the process. Paid there, too. Burgers were great according to my kids. I got the veggie burger which was also great. It was almost $5, while the regular burgers were less than $3. It's crazy how smashed beans and seasoning costs more than dead cow still.  I believe the owner was there to help out.  He let me know they use no plastic in their packaging.  Everything is plant- based.
All in all a good experience.< /review>< Pictures>

Was pretty excited to finally try this place out . When I arrived a gentleman came out to show me how to use the kiosk and make sure i got exactly what k was looking for . After a little conversation i realized he was one of the owners of the new establishment,  i dont remember his name but i commend him on his customer service . We made my burger exactly how I wanted it with all sorts of options.  I made a double bacon burger with pepper Jack and all the fixins and. a large dr pepper.   My total was just over 6$ I think . I was definitely pleased with the food .. it's not a 5 star restaurant as far as the menue goes but it's a good old fashion burger joint and a great cheap lunch.  We will definitely be back</text>

<text>I thought this was going to be good but I was wrong. The meat did not taste like meat it was way over seasoned and it was not quick. I thought it was called quick burger for a reason. 1 star.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

Also, the line was pretty short, 3 cars between me and the order station, but it still took over 15 minutes to get my food. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Quick Burger.</review></record>

OMG EVERYONE... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!

the fried are made in an air fryer and have a killer blend of garlic and spices...

Burger was so juicy and we'll made..

YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW GOOD IT IS... FOR $3 THE BURGER WAS AWESOME!

Drive thru has touch screens, and it was super easy..

Ordered 6 DIFFERENT burgers and all were made correctly.

GO TRY IT!< /Review>

<review>absolutely amazing customer service. best i’ve ever had. the people that work here obviously care deeply about giving the best experience possible. obviously a nice family owned business!

any bad reviews about this place are by people who clearly have zero respect for good and honest work. the food is cheap and very very good.

these people are just trying to make it, and  i’d rather give them my money than some other cheap nasty fast food place :)< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Not impressed. Burger was marginal at best. The vanilla shake was funky, almost like it was made with frozen yogurt or something like that. I'm about 90% sure the Coke is not actual Coke but an off-brand.

There are tons of good choices nearby that are pretty much the same price.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80db7fddf6c4d479:0x313a8a157e79d4e5<//Gmap_id></record>

Very nice food, fast and great service. They did get my order wrong, but I went back and they fixed it up for me, and were very happy to make amends. Noah was very delightful in helping me fix this issue. Will definitely be my new go to burger joint.</review>

Carl's junior burger is way better in taste. Vege burger is horrible. The Bun i think they can order from a better place. There was no line therefore I pulled in the drive through.
After tasting beyond burger n vege ...nothing special...menu as well..once they go out of business here I think if Aztec Tacos move here the line will be seen from street. I wonder what kind of state would like this chain...in southern California we take our food seriously...</review>

The concept is neat having the ability to custom order your burger or chicken sandwich the way you want it. My wife & I saw that this place finally opened so we pulled in today. I ordered a burger and tapped the add on option for bacon AND WAS CHARGED FOR IT.. yet when i opened my burger up..no bacon & we were miles down the road..so 3 stars.
Food was ok otherwise for me. My wife complained her burger was soggy & watery. Fries were NOT hot..barely warm. Theyre gonna need to tighten it up<//Review>

I ordered a double cheese burger, chicken sandwich, fries, and a vanilla shake. Basically, build your own sandwiches. Overall, 4 stars. Chicken was a bit overdone, but still very good. Real beef hamburger (there is beyond meat available) was delicious. For those that like crispy fries, these are not for you. Fries were really good and not salty at all. Vanilla shake was just ok.< /Text>

Worst chicken sandwich I have ever had. Ordered 3 chicken sandwiches and all inedible. Customer service was okay, fries were not bad but chicken was so rubbery you could not eat. If this is the norm this place won’t be open long.</Review>

<time>1599613423563<//time><user_id>118133936986782764436<//user_id><Review>Interesting idea. This place seems to be very progressive. Health conscious. And environmentally friendly.

First thing I noticed is you order on a touch screen (normally might be a good idea but now since we have a pandemic, I wish there was better reassurance that it was a clean screen.)

Second,  it's completely cashless. No cash. That does hypothetically cut down on a lot of potential problems including sanitation, robbery, and it could also hire people with low credit (most businesses won't hire people with bad credit when there's money handing involved.)

It is a very simple menu (almost too simple. I'm thinking they will add things in the future but for now...) I just ordered a burger. But they also have a chicken sandwich and an impossible burger. You can choose between regular bun, whole wheat, or a lettuce bun. Then you choose every topping. There's nothing unique for toppings. Very basic. Ketchup, mustard, onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles mayonnaise, an aoili, which I'm guessing was some type of hot sauce or Chipotle possibly because it was orange red colored. Nothing too crazy. And a few types of cheese. Just very simple choices.

I added air fried fries but they also have air fried sweet potato fries. It is healthier eating without using oil to fry but I might take awhile getting used to this type because they do not stay warm for long and the texture is slightly pasty and limp. It is satisfying knowing I didn't eat fried foods. I guess...

Finally, I added a chocolate shake which was basically a Wendy's frosty. Except it had a little more of a homemade feeling to it. Really good. I love frostys. (Straws are paper)

Overall not bad. The positives are the health conscious and for fast food, I do like the cashless checkout. The negatives would be the selection. I mean, if it's just a burger on the menu, I want the burger to be extraordinary. It was very low price and fast and friendly but I'm almost wishing it was a seasoned slider or 3. I do like simplicity and I can see the direction they are going is steering away from junk fast food and making healthier fast food but I just think that with so much competition, I need a little more of a signature on it. I almost feel guilty for saying that because to agree would be the problems that other countries see with Americans about how good, decent, food just isn't enough. Everything in America has to be kicked up a notch.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80db7fddf6c4d479:0x313a8a157e79d4e5< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

<text>Can not be beat for price per quality. Some of the cheapest food around yet tastes as good or better than ‘premium’ burger eateries across town.

Pros :
Cheap
Lots of taste
Was relatively quick
Meant to be health and environmental conscious
Customer service was excellent for a brand new place

Cons:
Very finicky and laggy touchscreen operating systems for ordering
Never actually knew if my order went through or not.

All in all a great addition to a really competitive food segment but makes its own name with environmentally conscious and delicious food at a crazy low price.< /text><rate>5</rate><Time>1594781220012< /Time>< GmapID>

Quick Burger basically means "microwaved burger". The cheeseburger was microwaved with the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on it which were hot and mushy. The burger patty was a gray color and flavorless. So much of the condiments were put on that the burger basically slid out of the bun. The fries were also microwaved,  mushy and limp. After 2 bites I threw the bag in the trash. Never again.</Review>

Came here to see what it was all about.  Got a burger but did not try the fries.  It was delicious and I will definitely be coming back to try the fries.  Touch screen drive-thru had gloves for you if you are concerned.  I'm curious as to what the prices will become and that will tell if I am a forever customer.< /Text>

I was quick to place my order but to be polite I let the two cars ahead of me approach the window first which led to my order sitting for several minutes. When I got to the window my order was placed in a microwave and what was handed to me was a 200+ degree chicken sandwich that burned my mouth. I won't be back unless they eliminate the microwave ovens.<//Review>

The beef burgers that my husband and I had were great, the aoli is probably my favorite part of it. It really sets them apart. The fries are ok, we tried the regular and sweet potato fries. The flavor is great, but they weren't warm. I know they are cooked in an air fryer type oven, and we appreciate that it's healthier, but it seems that you can easily get cold fries if you don't time your visit right.

They didn't have chocolate shake when we went, but my husband liked the vanilla. He said it was frothy, which sounds good to me! We are glad a place like this opened and they'll need a little time to perfect the business, and we will definitely come back and have it again</Text>

I never give 5 stars to anything but this place had me satisfied from the beginning. I had the meatless burger, amazing and the sweet potato fries were my favorite part as they were NOT overpowered by SALT.<//review>

< Review>
I went there hoping for the best but was completely disappointed with burger and fries . Fries are ok nothing to get excited about and I tried both the Russet and sweet potato ones they were both not worth having more then a few of .. as far as burger goes I had a double and single for kid but meat was pretty flavorless not warm and dry  hate to say it but even bacon was blah and of all things the darn bacon  and my kid even said it tasted dry. Someone will like them but to each their own it's just not great at all or even worth going back with all the better options out there .. maybe they are slowly getting things together but I wouldn't even risk it going back.<//Review>

The burgers were really nice and juicy!! The only disappointing part was this was my second time coming in and I had to come twice to get the remaining stuff from my order. Other than that it was pretty good< /Review>

Horrible experience. From start to finish 45 minutes through their self-service drive thru. Multiple people had issues with their kiosks not working correctly. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told there is no manager and I had to look it up online. I asked what the hold up was and was told they were having issues with their impossible burgers, whatever that means. Another employee didnt have their hair pulled back and hanging in their face. I said I better not have a hair in my food and of course I did! The food was of course cold, fries were soggy. Just overall horrible. Waste of money.< /review>

<Date>1602560400677<//Date><rate>3</rate><Review>Randomly found this place looking for a place to eat.  It is burger joint that reminds me of Sonic or Rally's but a whole lot better.  Place is strictly drive thru or walk up service.  No inside seating.  I do not remember seeing any tables outside.  You pull in and place your order via touch screen.  Pull up close to the curb or it is a little hard to reach.  I love how you can customize your order without worrying if the server can understand you over the speaker phone.  It is strictly card only.  You pay at the kiosk and remember the number that flashes on the screen.  The kiosk is very similar to what many of the fast food locations are adopting.  You pull up, state your number, and they hand over the food.

The night I stopped in, the gentleman checking the kiosk was very friendly and helpful.

The burger was really good.  It is not huge but very good.  Fries were ok.  Compared to my ideal fry, it was a step up from ok.

I was really impressed with the set up.  It is set up to be quick and efficient.  One hick up I fore see is large orders where you have to manually enter multiple entries, some one who is not familiar with touch screen, or some one who is very undecided on what they want to order and just stares at the screen.

Overall, well worth it.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

You have to order on a touch screen, no one to help or answer questions. Food was not quick, hamburger bun was stale and dry. The only upside is that it was super cheap so I didn’t feel too bad about tossing it. Save your time and money and go to Five Guys or in and out!</review><Rate>1< /Rate>< Name>

<Review>Both the customer service and food were great! Love that we have a place that doesn’t over load their food with unnecessary salt. Tried the burger and fries and can’t wait to try the chicken sandwich next. For a brand new business opening during the middle of the COVID pandemic I am sure they have a few extra challenges and kinks to work out but I am so happy to have them as apart of the South Temecula family!</Review>< pics>

Went today for the first time and had a good experience. No wait for the kiosk. Love that we could take our time to order for our family of 5 without having to yell through a speaker. It was a little laggy and I think they could streamline the process to make ordering a bit quicker. I appreciated that they provided gloves. They didn't have some items, no POG or shakes or guacamole yet. Our food came out quickly, but like others have said, the fries were cold. I think they need a way to get their food hotter. I thought my burger was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but I like the eco-friendly attitude of the company and the low prices so I feel it was fine for the money. I wish their website had nutrition information. My daughter didn't like the bacon she had on her burger- said it was too "smoky". I hope they take these criticisms and improve some of their processes. All-in-all it was a good experience for a new fast food place and I'm sure we'll be back.</review>

I am 11 years old and I love Quick Burger. I love how healthy they are compaired to other fast food places and that their prices are resonable. The hamburgers are char-boiled, and the french fries are air-fried. Every time I have been there, they've never let me down on the quality of their hamburgers and french fries. When I was there last, Quick Burger's owner was outside helping other customers with their amazing touch screens. I also noticed that they are taking all precautions due to COVID-19 like wearing face masks, gloves, and staying 6 feet apart. I like how they have vegan options because my sister is vegan and it's her new favortie restaurant. Please go to Quick Burger whenever you can for the best food ever!<//Text>

<Text>They have the most affordable Black bean burgers and Beyond Burgers!

I understand Quick Burger is still new, so they still have time to perfect the menu!

My only real complaint was my fries were not hot or "fresh".

Please add:
- app to order
- Guacamole
- "Guilt-Free" Cheese (Follow Your Heart)
- "Guilt-Free" Shakes! (Oat, Soy, or Almond)
- "Guilt-Free" Ranch
- "Guilt-Free" Bacon (SweetEarth)
- "Guilt-Free" Fried Chiken Sandwich
- "Guilt-Free" Fried Chiken Strips
- "Guilt-Free" Breakfast ("JUST EGG")< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

This library is awesome and a good place to study and read. they adjusted very well to curbside pick-up and It is very straight forward. If your looking for a fun place to stay and read this is the place. Some books I might suggest for you to read are, The Land of Stories Series, The Sisters Grimm, Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus, The Kane Chronicles, Magnus Chase, Harry Potter, Wings of Fire, Fablehaven, Dragonwatch, The Candy Shop War, Beyonders, and The Five Kingdoms, The Hunger Games, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid.</Review>

<UserId.>103627373352548677612< /UserId.><Text>This is a delicate subject to bring up but this morning a gentleman brought with him a special needs individual and sat at one of the tables in the back. Unfortunately this individual was making these loud noises during his two hour stay.and I mean loud, I could hear him through my headphones. This went on without staff addressing the issue, it wasn't until another patron approached and asked politely if they could lower their voices and that individual was met by a rude response by the person that was taking care of the Special needs person. Two hours and thirty minutes later a staff person finally approached the two individuals and asked them kindly to lower their voices, since it is a library. Due to the slow response by staff personal, it might have taken a turn for the worse, glad things did not escalate any further.

I will say this is one of the most beautiful and cleanest libraries I have ever visited...< /Text><gmap_id>0x80e835d8fe687da3:0x3bc22788c0488f04<//gmap_id><rate>2<//rate>< Response>

Really love this library that the city had to offer. It is a very unique building with an awesome pirate ship room and looking very clean around the building. The computers are very cool to use too. Great for after school hang out. Sometimes the books can be a bit harder to find sometimes. Been here since the opening of the library.</Review>

You have a good library and everything, but your IBM Selectric II is in pretty bad condition, you screwed the ribbon cover on, and will not replace the ribbon.</Review>

A really beautiful library with a lot of resources and many public events. I have lived in Camarillo for 24 years.. The old library was quite small and plain.  The residents care enough about having a great library to put their money where there mouth is.  Concerning some people who object to not being able to bring drinks in, would you like it if people came into your house and spilled drinks?  Respect the library, there is a cafe and seating just outside the library where you can eat and drink.  Don't be selfish.</text>

I love the building. People are so chill. Especially when you walk inside, a simple yet elegant architecture that makes you want to come back. This is not the most beautiful libraries I've been to but this library is very homey.</Review>

Wonderful library , helpful staff, quite upstairs. An amazing kids area shaped like pirate ship. The selection is good but if you don't see it you can generally order it from there Website it takes 1 to 2 weeks but how can you complain it is free.<//text>

I love this place don’t get me wrong. This is a lovely clean library, but I just got here and I found out that they close at 5 on Fridays? I mean I get closing earlier on Saturday and Sunday, but it’s a weekday and school just started for many. I drive 30 mins to this library because I love the atmosphere but these hours are ridiculous. It’s not even 5 yet and they’re pushing people out and turning off the lights. It’s not like this place was dead, I saw a lot of people (especially young kids) studying, reading, or on their computers working. Libraries are the some of the only places left to promote a learning and safe environment for everyone. Please consider extending your hours on Friday, it’s still a weekday and students do come in here after class to work.< /Review>

Wonderful library, great to get work done however I have never encountered such a strict library. People go in there to get work done and usually spend hours if not the whole day in there, cut us some slack let us bring in just a cup of coffee...or in my case don't make me throw out water in a Starbucks cup because it's not bottled -__-</Text>

<text>A beautiful library with a fantastic children's section. Everytime I go, there are always many tutors to help with your child's school work, and loads of activities during the summer time to help stave off boredom.

The audio visual library is always growing and being updated as well.<//text>< Pics>

<text>This is such a beautiful library with many amenities and events for the community.  I attended the Author Talk yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed Reyna Grande's discussion about her memoir, The Distance Between Us.
Grande had the audience captivated as she explained how she formulated
her book and the message she wanted to express.  The librarian host was very gracious - the author talk was outstanding - the whole program flowed
beautifully.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Kudos for pushing 6-8 cars through the drive-through in about 15 min. This is consistent over a few visits so far. (Kudos for even having a drive-through to begin with and for a location near the I-5 in north county!)  My recent order contained tenders instead of chicken pieces (disappointing for me) and the itemized receipt in my bag was for another person's order (with tenders) instead of showing my own meal deal. The other items in my order were correct though. Probably a simple mix-up. Other recent trips were error-free. They are working very hard to meet high demand and doing quite well, but I hope mix-ups don't become a pattern.  If you're looking for a Popeye's fix, this location is a good solution.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

They were not equipped to handle a lunch rush.
If they can't open the dining room they need to remedy the drive-thru delay.
The chicken is great though.
The associate at the window was great.<//Text>

< review>
I recently visited the newest location in Oceanside, CA (Oceanside Blvd) with my Autistic daughter, who had been talking non stop about placing her order. She had memorized the entire menu and knew exactly which sauces to try.

We order through drive through, and confirm which sauces we wanted. Drive up window I encountered 3 employees with theirs backs facing me while waiting to be acknowledged for 2-3 minutes.

Get home to enjoy the meal and no SAUCE was provided in our take out. Not that it’s a big deal but it kinda is because what makes these different from every other place serving fried chicken is there special Louisiana sauces!

If anyone has met an Autistic person you can feel my pain about trying to explain why there is no sauce :( and yes I could have drove back, walked in and complained but I went through drive thru for a reason!

Disappointed special needs Mom< /review>

<Text>I have now tried twice and im done. The first time, the wait was 50 min. This time my car and one other car were in line at 945pm. We ordered at 947 and waited until 1005pm. They came back and said " your order is going to 10 min". We were already waiting for over 15 min for absolutely nothing and already paid. They offered to give us some other kind of chicken instead but we opted for our money back. This was my second attempt and i live extremely close. Will not try again.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This Popeye's Louisiana kitchen recently opened. I have never eaten a Popeyes so I figured I'd give it a try. I had the classic chicken sandwich which I found to be pretty darn tasty.<//text>

I waited fourty minutes to give my order, 8 pcs. Spicy thighs with a side of coleslaw. Waited out front for 20 min. for all thighs. When I got home I found four legs and fries.  I know they are new, but they have to at least get their order right.< /text>

I don't usually rate or post but this was so unacceptable . My spicy chicken sandwich was RAW , it can give me salmonella/ food poisoning. The ladies in the drive thru were so rude when ordering . 2/16/21</Text>

Been there 3x and everytime they forget some thing (biscuits, sides, entree) after calling to tell them about it they blame me for leaving without it and really speaking unprofessionally to their customers. When I have a toddler in the car so I get my food and drive home i can’t really just wait another 30 minutes in line for this.< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>There's no such thing as fast food when it comes to any Popeyes that I've ever been to in Southern California; especially this location. This place has lines as long as In-N-Out, and this place is about 3x slower than In-N-Out. Expect to wait 30 to 50 minutes for your order, even without tons of cars in line. Ive gone multiple times because I do love the food and price; however the wait is extremely frustrating and many times I still find myself thinking that it wasnt worth the wait. Don't think that Im being just unreasonable because this location is new...they pulled staff from other Popeyes who were already trained up and it's still unacceptably slow. I dont understand why Popeyes cant keep up with making a lot of food in advance and keeping it warm and fresh (somehow?) in order to keep cars moving through the drive-thru at a much faster pace. KFC can pull off faster cooking so why can't Popeyes? I get that KFC isnt as high quality as Popeyes, but still...there has to be a way for these guys to get orders out faster. If I owned this business I'd be looking into ways to drastically improve production, because it should be clear to any business owner that frustrated customers leads to a decline in repeat sales, and long-lines scare people away, and this means LESS SALES. Popeyes slogan of "Louisiana-Fast" has me thinking the phrase is more of an ironic joke than anything truthful. Louisiana-Fast must mean "half-speed" for the rest of us... Do I expect McDonalds speed? No. But do I expect to wait in line for 50 minutes when there's only 6 cars ahead if me? NO. If great tasting and affordable food is worth it to you and you have no place to be while having no idea how long you'll be stuck in line without being able to quickly leave if youre running low on gas or need to use the restroom...then try it out! It honestly is great food. They really need to fix their production time though; and that's an issue for every local Popeyes around this area. I've been to Popeyes in other states and they're super fast...so maybe its a regional training issue that badly needs attention.</Review>< pics>

Absolute garbage. Long wait, no online ordering despite the fact that it's brand new. The sandwiches are not fresh and have no sauce. Get it together.</text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service and to top it off the drive thru is very badly located.

I got a nice grilled veggie wrap and delicious side salad for a late lunch for only $7 (lunch special). Listened to great beats while waiting. Fast, friendly service and lots of choices. I recently switched to vegan, and they were willing  to accommodate me.<//text>

<review>High quality food freshly made for your order. Family owned. I was waiting on a huge Postmates order and they offered me the sandwich and fries. So good turkey, avocado, tomato, pesto, balsamic vinegar plus more all put in together to make a taste to touch type of sandwich. Exploding your mouth with so much flavor. They have a lunch special for half sandwich w/ your choice of either fresh salad or cut fries. YUM! Defiantly Coming back as a customer.</review></record></dataset><record>

Probably one of best salmon sandwiches I've had, along with the tasty truffle fries. Good customer service. I was surprised they had infused mint and cucumber water! Overall very satisfied with this place and right next to my favorite brewery</review>

<review>Had the curry chicken croissant sandwich. Was expecting it would be like a curried chicken salad, but it was actually more like curry seasoned grilled chicken breast strips. It was topped with coconut, lettuce, and tomato, and was pretty mildly seasoned with a bit of sweetness. Really delicious. Salad was great too. The dressing tastes homemade. A great stop for lunch!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I ordered the turkey panini and asked for a different cheese than Swiss cheese.  They had burrata cheese as an option and it made the sandwich amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the turkey panini. And with the sandwich comes a side of either fries, a side salad or roasted vegetables. I chose the healthier option of the roasted vegetables and loved them. They were nice and warm with this delicious sauce coated over the veggies of bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, corn, and onions. The sauce had a little black pepper flavor with some sweetness.
The two times I've gone, there's never been an issue finding parking during lunchtime hours. And there's a lot of businesses in the shopping center.<//Review>< pics>

Gourmet Artisan has the best burgers in San Diego! Their prosciutto sandwich is great as well, as are their frys and veggies.

Reasonable prices, huge portions, and a great staff that's super accommodating.

You'll want to call ahead if you're in a rush since the food can take a while to come out, but the food is so worth it!</Text>

Friendly service, fair prices, and high quality food. A perfect lunch location, or great for a fast and healthy dinner.

The chicken pesto sandwich was portioned well and tasted great.
The almond croissant was very good, too.
As a side, the shoestring fries are fine and plentiful, but I'll get the mixed veggies when I go again. I had some froom my girlfriend's plate and they were seasoned perfectly and had a nice variety.< /review>

<review>Unfortunately, there are many mediocre places to dine in the Miramar area making it challenging to find good food. Fortunately, if you are reading this, you need to look no further for a tasty sandwich! The sandwiches are fresh and healthy. You can tell owner has pride and is not out to make a buck by reselling Costco after school specials like so many others in the area.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Absolutely amazing sandwiches... The ingredients are as fresh as you can get.. the breads used are also freshly baked which really lets this place stand by itself among many competitors.

The chicken pesto sandwiches are enough to feed two people..  for the quality and quantity you are getting, this value proposition is amazing..

It's a family owned and run business and the faces are friendly.. I'd definitely give them a try and I promise you'll come back again..

I'm going to start ordering lunch atleast one day a week until I try out their entire menu.< /text>

<review>Very tasty sandwiches! I love the turkey, swiss, avocado sandwich, it comes with a basil-type of sauce that is delicious. Their fries are also spectacular: thin, crispy, and addictive! I also had their squash soup once and it was very good. Highly recommend this place!< /review>< user>

Food and service were great. It happened there was an ingredient that my son did not like on his sandwich that was not listed, and the owner quickly remade food without any issue. We are planning to return soon< /Review>

The sandwiches were excellent (although it was a little pricey for counter serve).  I would have rated a 5, but the service was sooo slow.  There was nobody else waiting for food when we ordered and it took over 40 minutes to get sandwiches.  And the music was awful - normally I can deal with just about anything, but it was blaring saxophone turned up really loud.  We chose to sit outside and have our ears physically hurt from the fighter jets training at Miramar.</text>

I was at Gourmet Artisan Fine Sandwiches on April 12th. I had the Blue Burger which came on a tray with a cute newspaper deli wrap. The food was great but the newspaper wrap was atrocious.

The paper was dated November 19, 1989 and on its front page boasted the following articles:  The Berlin Wall Falls, Remarkable Upset in Olympic History, Titanic Found, and a crossword puzzle.

The only event that happened in November of 89 was the Berlin Wall falling. US over Soviet Olympic hockey game was in 1980 (Olympics happen on EVEN years), The Titanic was found in 1985; a little late to the party on these stories. The crossword would have been fine except for the following clues: Across 11: "____ Doubtfire" and Down 18: Sandler of "Big Daddy" Surely they could have come up with more appropriate 1989 clues to get us to the answers "Mrs" and "Adam".

Gourmet Artisan Fine Sandwiches is Fake News!< /review>

I waited 40 minutes for a sandwich. To top it off there was meat in my vegetarian sandwich. Bummed I didn't have a good experience like others, oh well.< /review>

< Review>
Eddy did a great job re-fitting two hose bibs to accommodate new irrigation. We have used EJ Plumbing multiple times and will continue to call them for all our plumbing needs! Prices run a bit higher than other shops, but their employees are professional and the work is great. From the admin side... was able to get appointment quickly, received “heads-up text” Eddy was on his way, and got a detailed invoice via email after the job was done. Highly recommend!<//Review>

I had a need for fast plumbing repair in Cupertino and had searched across the internet for the right agency.  I was very pleased with all of the responses but somehow the contact w EJ felt right.  They weren’t the lowest bid nor the highest but in my interaction made me feel the most comfortable performing the work.  They were professional, efficient and found a great alternative to what could’ve been a lot more work.  They are C-19 aware and slays masked.  The repairs were done by Gavin and Ivan and an excellent teamwork between them.  Highly recommend EJ plumbing and if these two dudes are Available for the work, make sure you ask for them.</Text>

Scheduled an appointment with the company for afternoon hours. Mid morning sitting in a meeting got calls and messages from company management that technician was dispatched right now to your property because he has time to do it now! Got a ball park estimate that was absolutely unreasonable. Value of visits like this is ZERO.< /Text>

< review>
pipe camera inspection.
Basically did the job right (after I requested further push the camera pass through the city's clean-out).
The explanation is good enough for the person without knowledge, like me. However, my friend is plumber, discussed with him after inspection and found out inspector can provide more information.
Clear and detail information should help customer make the right decision quick.
OK work but could be good/great easily.</review>

Recently, I recommended them to a friend for small plumbing job and 2 of their plumbers showed up and asked for 1200 for the job.  which my very unhappy friend refused.  luck had it that I have the need of plumbing repair and decided to call them for services.  Again 2 of their plumbers showed up.  From watching them, one of them is still in early stage of apprenticeship.  They also quoted me for a lot of $$$,  I was in a very tuff situation that I did not think I can get someone to help in a hurry, I bargained for 10% off.
After talking to other plumbers, I realized that the other experienced plumber actually did not know much about how the plumbing is done for situation like mine.
Anyway, if 2 plumbers show up for you small to medium job, it is more than likely that you are being bilked.
I strongly recommended that you don't hire them for you job.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great service (and price) from start to finish.

EJ plumbing just finished replacing our main sewer line today. Everything was AMAZING. From the initial phone call to schedule the estimate, through the quick estimate by Daniel the owner (will today afternoon work for you?), the quick scheduling (within less than a week) and the quick installtion( they started work before I even noticed and were done with city inspection before noon). Every one in the process was super pleasant and helpful. Thank you EJ Plumbing and Daniel for the wonderful, AAA service!!!<//text>

I'm very happy with my experience with EJ Plumbing.  Chris took care of us (our original installer - not EJ - did not install it properly and it never worked right.)  Once Chris figured out the problem - all went well.  The owner even stopped by to check on us!</review>

EJ Plumbing came in a knock my job out cold. They were amazing. They replaced water heater, gas line, moved washer connection and drainage, sink connections and drainage, connected up both of my fridges to water and ran a gas line to my stove. The were on time everyday and left my home looking like they had never been there. I have been using them for years and the continue to raise the bar on performance standards.

Thanks Manny and Danny!<//text>

I highly recommend this plumbing company.  They are a family owned business and it shows!  Owner Danny is honest and fair and Eddie and his crew were professional, competent and did a thorough job replacing my main sewer line, all with a smile.  If you are looking for a qualified plumbing service, look no further.  This company knows what they are doing and will treat your business with respect!</text>

EJ Plumbing came and saved my day! Found out we have a Hydronic Heat Pump & had never even heard of this thing...i called about 18 different HVAC and plumbing companies & all of them turned me down & said that they don't service these type of heaters.  I finally got to EJ Plumbing & called Danny. He came out the next day and took one look and knew what the issue was! He literally "flipped the switch" and my heater was working again! He charged me nothing to come out for his time. Highly recommended & will definitely call them again for any future plumbing/heater problems! THANK YOU DANNY!<//text>

We had a problem with water constantly running on one of our toilets and the water shutoff valve not working.  I called EJ Plumbing at 9 AM and they sent Victor, a great technician, out within half an hour.  He was a friendly guy and had both the water shutoff valve and the fill valve replaced in under an hour.  The total cost was $275 which is well worth it for such excellent work.< /text>

Over charge for a small job.
I would NOT recommend these guys. Job quality was also subpar.  All they want is to take advantage of somebody's situation.  A leak in the shower tub cost me over $1300.0 which is more than I expected.  the only thing they did is open up the wall from bedroom and replaced the pipes.
Plus, they did not leave me any receipt of the work.   Shop around before you hire these guys.< /text>

They replaced my water heater 6 years ago, and did it quickly and well.  When it started showing rust in the line, they talked me through how to flush it out - no charge.  When that didn't resolve the issue, they replaced it under the manufacturer's warranty.  The new heater was so effective that I had a bit of heat coming in the cold supply.  They came out the next day and resolved the issue with the quick installation of a check valve.  I've found the plumber I'm working with, as long as I live in the south bay!< /text>

I called EJ to have a blocked house sewer drain opened. The plumbing technicians arrived on time. They were courteous, professional, and very knowledgeable about all aspects of plumbing. Once they reviewed the drain layout they went work, quickly opening the blockage. I felt the cost was fair, and will use again.< /Text>

<review>I oversee several rental properties and haven't found a good, reliable plumber...until now! EJ Plumbing is going into my contact list. I run several businesses myself so I understand the challenges of overseeing staff, schedule and pleasing customers. Manny, the owner, and his team are rockstars! Everyone I talked to was professional and diligent. They did a gas pressure test and repaired several valves, explained things without being patronizing, and was clear on pricing. They were on time, GREAT about giving me a call or text update to keep me in the loop during the process, and their rates are very reasonable for the quality and timeliness of their work. I am using them for my next project and recommend EJ Plumbing highly!< /review>< pics>

<Text>E J Plumbing was so responsive to the fact that I needed a water heater right away.  Mel was very professional and accommodating and was able to replace my water heater within a few hours of my calling.
I highly recommend E J Plumbing and would certainly use them again.</Text><Name>Judy Poutre< /Name>< Pictures>

<Text>We had a really good experience with Robert and Javo! They were on time, very friendly and wore slips on their shoes so they wouldn't track dirt inside. The job was a little bigger than they had anticipated but it only took them a little while longer than their original estimate. We can't thank them enough and will definitely use EJ Plumbing again in the future.</Text>< Gmap_id>

EJ Plumbing fixed my mothers leaky shower plumbing issue.  Although she phoned several other local plumbers and set up appointments (none of these plumbers showed up) only EJ Plumbing actually called 20 minutes before their arrival and were early for their appointment.  EJ Plumbing is the BEST..  Give them a try if you need a plumber...< /Review>

I was referred to EJ Plumbing by my neighbor when I was looking to take care of a toilet leak issue in my crawl space area.
Ray Sanchez showed up and inspected the area and proposed a fix. The total effort took about 2.5 hours and the work was done in a very professional manner.
They didn't try to up sell and the price was very fair and competitive.
The work came with an year warranty for any future issues.</text>

They were promptly there at the scheduled time and were able to quickly replace the leaky bibs. Price was fair too.

<review>Daniel was very professional and went over the top to access and help the situation.  Had several other companies come out and when they left my loading docks were still full of water and the quotes for work needed was over double what EJ Plumbing quoted ...... and Daniel got the water to drain out of both docks before he left. They will be getting this job and all future work needed!!!< /review>< Name>

<text>Jess and his team did an amazing job with our place, starting with a small repair and ending with two much larger jobs.  The reason for providing them more work was simple - the quality and attention to detail was exceptional.

I will be honest that the work they do seems expensive - however I really don't know so this is only my feeling and should be taken as relative.  What I can however say is that the outcomes exceeded all of my (admittedly very high) expectations and there was not a single flaw in their work.  So really, what I paid was a bargain price for amazing work.

In a couple of years my wife and I intend on building an extension to our house - you can be assured they will be the only people I call to do our plumbing work!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
4/16 Victor came out for a clogged floor drain but could not find the access point behind the washing machine.

4/23 the owner Danny came out  and found the access point behind a washing machine and sent a plumber to snake the line from the washer to the curb- but not the floor drain we told Victor about 4/16

After they left on 4/23 we found the floor drain problem was still clogged after we paid  $250.

5/4, today,  Danny estimated another $250 to repeat the snake, this time through the floor drain. We declined the new estimate and will hire a plumber who does the work properly the first time</Review>

<Text>Manny and his team are the best in the biz! I've used them for two jobs--the first was to fix a major clog in our main shower. They had no hesitation to get on the roof to remove the blockage directly. For the second job, I needed a video inspection of my sewer line outlet in connection with a remodel. They were efficient, professional, and thorough. Their fees are also very reasonable. I would highly recommend them for all plumbing needs.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Excellent customer service.  EJ Plumbing quoted the lowest prices prior to arriving givien the possible scenarios.  Showed up on time.  Quickly diagnosed the problem.  Cleared the bathtub clog.  Aleksander left the bathtub cleaner than when he first arrived.  I will definitely use EJ Plumbing again.< /text>

First let me say I am a very meticulous and picky customer. I respect service providers whom say what they are going to do and indeed do it!  I have absolutely "no" tolerance for incompetence, nor will I compromise on quality, responsiveness, or customer service.   That being said, EJ Plumbing is the only company I used for my personal (my unit) and overall condominium property.   They have done several major plumbing projects for condominium property.  They have also done many projects for individual owners including myself.   I generally don't write reviews (good or bad), but I felt compelled to write today after the outstanding service I received today from Ray and Mel.   Special mention as well to Mike and Manny. Thank you guys .. you're the best.   PS, I reserve the right to provide future reviews (good or bad) as applicable.</text>

I've been using EJ Plumbing for several years.  They show up on time, communicate changes extremely well, provide great advice on-site, and work very efficiently.  What would take me an entire day, I have seen them complete in less than 20 minutes.

I have never been surprised by their fees - they explain all work (and the associated costs) up-front and communicate potential variables/over-runs clearly.

The services I've had them perform come with a 30-day callback warranty - and I've never needed to call them back to rework something.

Probably the best thing I can say about the company overall: they feel honest.  I have no worries when I call them.  Do give them a try if you're in need of a plumber!</Review>

I have used EJ Plumbing for years, and have never been disappointed.  They always exceed my expectations.  Usually Gregg helps us out, but today I needed to get a hot water heater working again.  I looked online and although Google said the place was closed today (Sunday), I placed a call, and they picked up right up.  They had Jairo and Sam come out in about 90 minutes, and they fixed the problem extremely quickly. They even waived all charges because it was under warranty.  I could not be more pleased with EJ Plumbing and will always use and recommend them.</review>

Our water heater was leaking pretty bad and despite the fact that they don't service customers on Sunday, Manny at EJ Plumbing (owner) returned my message a few minutes later and told me they could send someone over.  Luis was very professional, assessed the problem at hand - the heater was over 11 years old and was on it's last leg.  He didn't upsell anything and he gave me a fair price on a new water heater.  To be honest I was expecting an upcharge for the Sunday service and the fact that he came over so quickly.  Turns out he was coming back from church and he was in the area so it was good timing for everyone.  We've done several callbacks for drain cleanings as well and I've been extremely satisfied by their professionalism and fair pricing.<//Review>

EJ came out to fix the pipes under a master bath for us. The day we scheduled was the day of the "mega storm" here in the Bay Area. Power was out and there was quite a bit of flooding going on. I was worried that EJ was unable to get to our routine job and I had no way to communicate with them. Not only had they gotten in early and finished the work, but they didn't track mud or water all over the house either. They also checked a water line for the fridge ice maker and gave me an honest answer regarding putting in copper. I had a good experience considering I randomly called them off of the internet. We will likely call them again and I would use them for my place if I needed to.<//review>

Lifesavers!!! I've been using EJ Plumbing for many years. I have an older home, originally built in 1906, so the plumbing can sometimes be both mysterious and difficult to resolve. EJ Plumbing has gotten me out of some tough jams and have proven to be more of a partner than a service provider. They are relentlessly professional, conscientious, honest and fair.

Today I called them about a problem another repair company couldn't / wouldn't resolve over the weekend and rather than back away from a potentially tricky repair,  they jumped in, rolled up their sleeves and got to work.

Its not often you run into service providers with this level of obvious care and concern for their customers and customers property. I simply can't say enough good things about them. I recommend them  HIGHLY. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would.< /Text>

<text>Great COVID procedures, horrible employee harassment. I went to shop at Sephora with hundreds of dollars in my pocket and I was also waiting for a friend so I was texting and wanted to look around for awhile and replace a lot of stuff I really needed. I had a jacket on, a fuzzy mini backpack as a purse, and a bag from Starbucks across the street because I had just purchased two nice tumblers. They insisted I used one of their carrying bags to shop so I took it and used it. I started adding items I wanted and I like different brands so I was in different areas. I’d also take longer to decide so I’d eventually put something back and pick something else. After about ten minutes it started. The employees constantly asked if I was doing well and if I needed help which I didn’t mind. It got more and more frequent. Within half an hour to 45 minutes, I had multiple employees following me across the entire store, into every single aisle I went into. I tried to ignore them and focus on what I was deciding to buy, but it was so obvious and I have chronic bad anxiety and I couldn’t handle the stares. I kept walking around in hopes of being able to review the items in my bag alone. But it was never just employees. There were also 2-3 officers in full uniform dressed in a white button down black pants and wallow talkie visible on their shoulder. Several took turns following me. I got so uncomfortable I just sat on the floor pretending to look at something I didn’t even want. I didn’t dare even adjust my outfit or touch anything in my own bag. Just getting out my phone felt scary. Finally I heard them say (3 of them, ten feet away, staring directly at me) said that I had been in too many different sections on the store, that I had been walking back to the same spots (because I like certain brands the most and kept returning to my go tos when I couldn’t think anymore) and they mentioned to each other my little backpack, my jacket, and my Starbucks shopping bag. After hearing that I was furious because I had a lot of money and wasn’t planning to steal a single thing. I got up, walked very fast so they’d pay attention and follow me to the first aisle, stopped. Of course two employees and two officers directly behind me. I reached into my front pocket of my shorts and pulled out $600 in $20 bills and proceeded to pretend to count it right where they could see it. Instead of any apologies I heard an officer say “must be a valley girl” I put the bag of makeup I would have purchased right on the floor, and bolted towards the door. When the lady at the front(who was very kind and it wasn’t her job to go anywhere else) when she asked me why I hadn’t decided to purchase anything, I immediately told her that it was because everyone had been following right behind me the entire time and treated me disrespectful and like a complete as**ole. Then I pushed that door open HARD and stomped out. I will never shop at this Sephora again. Shame because I really wanted the makeup but I’ll buy it at Ulta!!! AWFUL LOSS PREVENTION AND EMPLOYEES, RUDE, ACCUSE INNOCENT PEOPLE!!<//text>< Pics>

Had my makeup done at this location today and it was by far and away the worst experience I've ever had. Im a rouge member so get my makeup done often. Knowing I was attending a wedding and staying on El Paseo I figured why not get my makeup done. I always request a senior artist as I've had a couple bad experiences in the past, and todays appointment was no different. The artist I was matched with was lovely & so nice, but you could tell she had done maybe one appointment in the past. My eyeshadow was up to my eyebrow, and when I arrived home my husband said it looked clown like. She also didn't really have an idea of how to do the makeup, and you could tell she felt a little lost. I'm normally easy going when it comes to my makeup and always tell the artists to do what they think is best, but this was THE MOST amateur artist I've had out of 100 appointments at different Sephora's and immediately went home, washed it off & did my own. Unfortunately I won't be back to this location<//text>

Never in my life have I felt so unwelcome or discriminated at a store. I was not greeted by any sales associate when I first walked in, which I found strange because when I shop at any other Sephora location I'm immediately approached. As I was looking for eyeliner I wasn't offered any help either. Once I was ready to pay, I was "helped" by two different cashiers who were both extremely unfriendly. Luis was the name of one but unfortunately I did not get the girls name (had both sides of nose pierced.) Both made me feel like I did not belong there, they did not appreciate my business. Once the transaction was finished and I did not receive a simple thank you by any of the employees, even as I was walking out. I'm not one to write reviews, or take surveys but the way the employees made me feel was definitely not okay. Everyone customer deserves to be treated with respect.< /text>

Not sure why, but I have never been a fan.  Every time I walk in there I just feel overwhelmed.  Have bought a couple of things over the years, but I never think, "I need to run to Sephora to get _____."</Review>

<text>This Sephora has to be the best one in this valley. We only have 2 Sephoras, the other one is just...uninviting. i walk in there and get rude looks, dont get asked if i need help 90% of the time, the other 10% is with luck. They dont smile and they have this snobby vibe. Now, the one in El Paseo they all greet me and they welcome me with a big smile and friendly faces and they ask me right away if i need any help. Thats how it should be especially in the make up industry, they make you feel valuable.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dafe7a944efe81:0xd8d2e3489997a0d8<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Sent hubby in to pick up a particular lipstick which is showing as in stock and is available to order from both sephora and huda. Sales associate apparently couldnt take the time to look at the picture he was sent with and told him "it isnt released until the 15th" which must the make up retail version of the lie told in sales when the actual answer is "I don't know or don't care to actually do any work". Perfectly fine taking my business elsewhere if doing their jobs is too hard for these ladies. (Its also worth noting that absolutely no one greeted or offered any help) whoever manages this store needs to get it together, customer service isnt rocket science and these products are too expensive to not offer high quality service at these stores.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I have  mixed feelings about my visit today. I did not receive a hello from any of the employees I brushed it off and then I went about my shopping experience and they gave me odd looks and when I would smile at them, I would not get a smile back I think the only positive experience I had was with the cashier. Will not be returning to the store and I will continue to shop at their smaller location in the  Palm Desert mall<//Review>< pics>

Love the selection of perfume. Very happy this location carries Gucci Rush (1999 juice edition) and Juliette Has A Gun rollerballs. The lovely ladies are helpful and even got me hooked on Marc Jacobs enamored lipglosses.  Dior makeup selection is vast; so is Armani. Lots of brands to play around with and cute selection of Korean skincare. Anchored by Saks and Wilma and Friedas brunch spot: so perfect shopping for high end shopping and lunch!<//Text>

< review>
Was passing by this place and wanted to stop by for a drink but saw these lovely plants just sitting there in this awful state!!! This negligence made me stop and I went to another bar. Makes me wonder how they handle their cocktails and dishes... This is the face of the store, after all. The management obviously does not care, which is very sad and unprofessional.<//review>

Neighborhood bar that has a pool table and a few TVs. It's in the city so finding parking is a little tricky. You'll probably need to park a few blocks away on the street. They dont have a kitchen but they share a wall with a restaurant that you can order from. The vibe was sort of aloof towards "outsiders". The bartender seemed more interested in finishing his conversation with a couple of regulars than serving us. The smoking area is out the back door and was very cramped and dirty.< /Text>

The bartenders there are rude when the place is full. They will ignore your requests and tell you things like " money talks." I spent $200 in the 2 hours I was and the people near me spent about the same. If you aren't spending hundreds don't expect them to be nice and respectful.</text>

We ordered a party box. 16 burgers but our order was totally wrong. Wrong patty on two of our styles and one style burnt beyond recognition. Got served hockey pucks. Im sure if you get a two burger meal it may be better but check your burgers for quality assurance before consuming.<//Review><Time>1545025774480< /Time><Name>tipsey chef</Name><Resp>None</Resp>< pics>

Stopped in to get a bite while waiting for a tour shuttle. I felt bad because the guy working was literally alone. He was taking orders (phone and counter) and cooking. He worked that place like  boss and did so with a pleasant demeanor! I had no expectations, but this is arguably the best burgers that I have ever had. The meat was fresh and well seasoned. The fries....OMG the fries! I had half sweet potato and half burgerim fries which were sliced like chips. They both were the perfect texture. I would love for this place to branch out to Texas (specifically Austin 😁).  I would plan a day just for the burgers and fries.< /text>

Wow! Super surprised with the quality of meat, flavors, and service.

Walking in a I didn't expect much from this strip mall set up.  Place was pretty empty besides the fact that there were plenty of workers.

I was perplexed with the menu ordering. 2 burgers for $6.99? Or three for $9.99? But my questions were answered when I received my order and found that they were sliders.  At that moment I felt annoyed and disappointed at the same time.

First slider up, the Murguez. A beef slider seasoned for various spices topped with pepper jack cheese, salad and jalapeños. Bursting with flavor I was ecstatic on how juicy and delicious this little Burger was. Suddenly, I felt slightly less annoyed.  Second up, the 28 day dry aged beef slider. Again, this little slider surprised me.  The little twang from the aged beef and California toppings ( Swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato) adds the perfect touch to this Burger.

Added bonus: buy $10 worth of food and get 4 delectable pieces of chicken wings/Nuggets with your order. Trust me. These chicken wings can stand on their own vs any chicken wing joint.  Don't know  how long this is going to last. Come check them out!!<//Review>

<Review>Gourmet burgers tasty awesome shakes. Once you get any service and do not bring a gift card they make a big stink and make it very difficult to use. But a half an hour later great munch on.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Best burgers on Sunset. There is a parking lost in the front of the store. Burgerim is hands down my most favorite burger restaurant in Los Angeles. Trust me, the food at this place is great tasting. Being a fan of burgers and fries, I am very picky about it. The classic beef burger, turkey burger, lamb burger, and veggie burger is absolutely delicious with the right amount of flavor to it.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

For what it is, I enjoyed it. I'm a fan of sliders, so, getting to choose different ones was good. I'll stick to the beef though, the lamb didn't taste like lamb, so kind of a wasted opportunity.  The guy behind thr counter was super nice and helpful. Unless you're supremely hungry, two of the sliders is sufficient especially if you're getting a side of fries.  I was SUPER full.</Text>

By far the best burgers we have ever tasted. We are from England and visited 3 times as they do really great gluten free buns and our son has coeliac disease. Staff very friendly and nothing is too much trouble<//Text>

<Review>Ashley here ! I work at Pink Dot and I always go to this place for lunch. Everything is fresh. The environment is friendly and the staff there is super nice. I always get their chicken it’s super juicy savory and has the right amount of spices to it. They have the best coupons and promotions to keep you coming back for more I’m on the path to a free burger . And you can get one too ! Just ask them for a punch card. You must purchase a combo : burger, fries and drink . Every time you go they punch your card but only for a combo. It’s fabulous darling ! Fabulous ! ❤️<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>5<//rate><time>1544559709608</time><GmapID>0x80c2bebddbb95e43:0xa135086616fb20f3</GmapID></record>

when for 1rst time to try several burgers....at last all meat taste the same n burgers build the same..when personal ask me how was the experience...said all burgers no Difference...on flavor n build..answer...oh yes..all meat taste basiscly same...but on how build burger its up to customers choise....😕😕 i believe if u are the expert on 🍔 u should offer it the best to the taste to distinguish meat and or meat flavors...</Review>

<review>Excellent place to shope for gifts for others and yourself.

After coming here for years, the shop does a fantastic job of keeping the shop feeling fresh, and up to date. Merchandise and the layout of the shop changes throughout the months, which is very nice.

Best of all, my favorite, is the coffee shop. It's so delicious. Sweet Bee is my favorite latte. The vegan donuts are surprisingly delicious.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Lovely small business with an excellent coffee shop towards the back of the store. Enjoyed a matcha latte and then admired everything for sale from fabulous books, super soft t-shirts, and colorful soaps. A great place for local holiday shopping. Bonus: discounted coffee drinks on early Monday mornings!< /Review>< pics>

I like it,fun hip environment with seating outside too,but the merchandise is unique. From jewelry to gift cards to candles its lovely here. The doors are wide enough for strollers or wheelchairs. There's limited parking out front,but you can absolutely park in the two story structure out front as well.< /Review>

There is also a section for costume jewelry to sunglasses and scarfs.  If thirsty try the coffee and tea bar and did I mention the wide selection of hydro flasks.  The employees are also very helpful and courteous especially the one singing or harmonizing as she tends to the customers needs.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Can't say enough about local fixture.  I'm in here pretty much on the daily to pick up a drink at the coffee bar.  Their coffee is on point.  They also do some workshops to talk about freshness and different types of coffees. But beside the coffee they are a cute little shop with giftables, clothing, bags, books, kids clothes and items, jewelry and much more.  Since I'm here so often it doesn't get boring...they are always changing the merchandise and updating products. They are part of the five stars app. Which helps you earn points to free and discounted products, special rewards and events.   Staff are pretty frendly as well.  Hope they keep it up!<//review>

Really cool stuff for babies and star wars stuff and great humorous stuff and good coffee for decent prices. I had a soy latte. Chill workers too. The men restroom IS for singleperson use despite two urinals, i think. The toilet has no door for itself. Cool, i guess. Has poopouri.</Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) A store that mixes sale of various items: plants, soaps, clothes, books, gifts, souvenirs from the city of Whittier, jewelry, and much more, delighting the buyer and visitor!
There is also the Patagonia brand inside the premises and of course a good coffee with a variety of drinks and sweet pastries.
A beautiful environment, very cozy, super recommended, well located and with excellent service, smiling and friendly people!
I would also recommend it for an appointment where you need good atmosphere and something to drink, you will love it !!!
They let dogs in, which gives many additional points!

Una tienda que mezcla venta de artículos diversos: plantas, jabones, ropa, libros, regalos, souvenirs de la ciudad de Whittier, joyas, y mucho más, haciendo las delicias del comprador y visitante!
También está la marca Patagonia dentro del local y por supuesto un buen café con variedad de bebidas y bollería dulce.
Un ambiente hermoso, muy acogedor, súper recomendable, bien situado y con excelente atención, personas sonrientes y amables!!
También lo recomendaría para una cita dónde necesites buen ambiente y algo para tomar, te va a encantar!!!
Dejan entrar perros, lo que le da muchos puntos adicionales!< /Review>

<Text>I took my truck to the Lancaster Grand American Tire (GAT) to get new tires, shocks, and upper control arms put on.

The truck is a 1995 Dodge 2500 4x4.

The tires and shocks were provided by GAT, I brought the control arms because I could only find one company that makes them cnc bent to clear larger tires without rubbing. I put the lowers on myself.

The upper bolts were difficult to remove so I supplied new bolts and nuts in case the old ones had to be cut out. Ramsey, the service advisor, told me they had to remove the lowers to get to the uppers and would charge an extra hour of labor, I understood, that was fine.

After GAT had the truck a full week I was told it's done. When I arrived (Friday 3/16) the control arms were installed with the bend pushing out so that the tires rubbed even more than stock.  When they took off the lowers that I already did they didn't even put them back on the same way. I was asked to take the truck and bring it back next week to be fixed.

Unfortunately I was moving that next week and I did not get the impression they would be able to fix it in time so I took it upon myself to flip all four control arms that weekend. Which I did. Ramsey also told me they had quite a bit of trouble installing them, but I was able to do it with a pair of jack stands and a basic tool kit without trouble...

What I found was disappointing to say the least. The upper control arms had been considerably damaged by what I can only assume was an incompetent mechanic.  They had sustained numerous heavy blows from a pointed object leaving the surface heavily pocked. I don't see why this was necessary when a rubber mallet or dead blow hammer would have done the same job of maneuvering the control arm without damaging it. Each control arm also used to have a grease fitting at each end and three out of the four on the uppers were sheared off. I'm surprised that this was not mentioned to me upon delivery of the truck and even more surprised that they were not replaced with new fittings after being broken off. I also found that the nuts I supplied were not used. The drivers side at least had the old flanged nuts which is good, but the passenger side had a regular nut with no flange and no washer. So they seem to have lost enough nuts (at least 6) that they had to dig a couple out of a bucket somewhere, but to use a regular nut without a washer is unprofessional. I would have rather been told and charged the $5 for new nuts that were correct.

I have attached pictures of the control arms how they installed them, and the damage I found when I took them off to flip them over correctly.  The last picture on the tailgate shows them with new grease fittings that I had to go buy and install.

They did check the alignment for me after I fixed their botched job.  I asked them for a refund for a portion of the labor I paid for, since I didn't get what I paid for, but got nothing.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhWWyBsgttlP7N7zoELixqgMYs8tK3vXaZ8RGa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg6KTdlES7BdxBoVdRPbG6hwDqL3hq3vYylopj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs24pJfxwWvRiJDBNB3cbD1rr7tf5p4tkPwwsV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN331k9t6ce256WA09x_PnF5CDtawUysrnUHLwg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuL1l8qaXCFaLEgvBUERYED420ISfPVRyoILZH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8f9jDPwaVBPdCn24RWH4usgFecvyxqhD9CKMh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c25ac10bc08f79:0x2da490231b302bdf</gmap_id></record>

Amazing service! I am new to the area of Lancaster and service guy, Duke, suggested a really great price for a 4/set. I had the incorrect size and they accomidated the new size immediately. They guys were all friendly and inviting. That meant a lot to me since I don't know much about tires.</review>

The very next day I looked for a tire shop in the area and found Grand American Tires. I went in without an appointment and they were happy to help me right away. They did wheel balancing and alignment for me and made sure it was safe to drive. Great customer service and fair prices. Thanks for all the help!<//review>< userid>

I went in to get a new set of tires and the guys were super helpful and professional! They followed all the covid safety protocols and did the tire mounting in a heartbeat. I had a few questions about the different kinds of tires and they answered them all. Overall, this is a great tire shop that I’m happy to recommend.< /Text>

Always a pleasure doing business with them.  I’m always treated in a professional manner, never upsold or pushed to buy anything I don’t want.  Although they do let you know of things that should be changed, it’s never pushed from my experience.  Great attitudes from everyone, and jokes all around! Amazing company will always come back!</review>

I would recommend this shop for all your vehicle needs. Their service is fast friendly and affordable. I walked in off the street explained my problem and I was scheduled the very next morning as this was the only day I had off and then they went ahead and fixed another part on my car and included the cost in the original quote.</Review>

If you are looking around for the best deals for tires I highly recommend you to check out this tire shop. You can browse their online catalog, they have a search bar where it’s pretty easy to find the exact type of tires you are looking for and they also do tire mounting, wheel alignment, and more. Everything for affordable prices.</text>

They always do a great job on my ford focus and I would like to highly recommend this auto shop to everyone. I purchased a set of tires here almost a year ago and today I went in for an oil change and they got me in and out in no time! They are efficient and detail oriented. Thanks for the hard work and keep it up.</review>

The team I met today were a great group of guys. Samuel is very quick and great with customer service and satisfaction. Abraham has a good sense of humor with good customer service skills. Thanks for your service today. I’ll be back for the wheel alignment/air conditioner guy and will get his name on my next visit. He’s very knowledgeable in what I explained going on with the vehicle 🤗 sorry I couldn’t remember his name but he’s a very nice man overall with the salt & pepper hair. Very distinguished gentleman 🤗🌹<//text>

I take all of my cars and my families cars to this location to get fixed. Today was the biggest purchase I’ve ever had to make. Brought my car in for diagnostics on my coolant system. Ramsey and his team got me in and got my car looked at in a timely manner and then notified me of what all the problems where and also forecasted things that he saw that would require work in the future. He gave me expert advise on the immediate repairs needed and informed me of all the warranties and cost associated with the repairs. He gave me an awesome unbeatable price on all the parts required to fix my car and after I agreed to the price he instantly got to work. My car was in and out of the shop within 6 hours.

Ramsey and his team completed AWESOME work on my coolant system (new radiator, new upper and lower hoses, new thermostat, new housings, full system flush, and OEM fluid replacements) that doesn’t even include the cost to pressurize and test the coolant system (if you try to rent the test parts from an auto parts store it’s $250 rental fee)

I highly recommend!!!< /Text>

The kind gentleman that helped me choose the right tires for my car was very professional and polite. I felt like I could trust me and he even got me a deal for the 4 tires. He explained everything to me clearly and when they did the mounting it only took them a few minutes. I would definitely recommend them to others.< /Review>

<Text>After calling every other tire place in town to get new tires for my truck, they had a price over $150 cheaper than the other guys. Not only did they have my order placed the same day, but had the tires installed the next day!! Also, they found a problem that I had told my other mechanic about 8 times and they said it was balancing, nope! A bent rim!! Defiantly bringing my Mustang next!</Text><gmap_id>0x80c25ac10bc08f79:0x2da490231b302bdf</gmap_id></record>

Been a customer with lancaster Grand American Tire for now over 8 years.
Ramiz is the go to guy. When I show up he gives me priority service. I use my vehicle for business and Grand American tires makes sure I keep moving. Please go there and show they your support.
Prices are very fair and work is excellent
Due to their head mechanic David) A+ props to him.
Trust worthy, Honest, and most of all they care about you and your vehicle
Thanks

<review>I didn't know where to go, to get tires out in Lancaster, but I have a Friend works for AAA and he'd worked out a deal at two different tire stores for me with friends of his and I still went to Grand American I got what I wanted, my Goodyear tires, I got great service and I had fun with Abraham, The only thing that was lacking was a soda machine for the long wait.
Since I used to work in the industry I don't give my recommendation or approval very often I'm more often critical than I am complimentary but I don't have anything to complain about down there and the service I got was great I got what I wanted when I wanted and I paid considerably less than I paid the last two times I bought the same exact tires.
The only thing that would have made it better is if they paid me to take the tires<//review>< Pics>

My dad recommended me 3 years ago Grand American Tire and I must say that I am very happy that he has done that. I always take my car to make repairs or replace some parts there, and I must say that all the materials they use are quality, the parts they replace as well. When I take my car to replace some parts, I have no problems with these times. I have no complaints about this spectacular company.< /text>

Grand American Tire is a great company. They have a lot of experience in repairing cars. They treat your car as if it were their own. The results are impeccable and their prices are very reasonable. Whatever the inconvenience in my car, they have always been there for me. That is why I do not hesitate to recommend them. His staff is very friendly and professional. The perfect combination to provide good service to its customers. I'm grateful.</text>

I feel they choose nothing but quality products and tools so I feel that I can trust them. The've also done wheel alignment and rotation for me and they are so efficient!

These guys put on the wrong size Roter.
It caused my break warning not to go off. When I took it to a shop. They said I was lucky I still had a break. It was hanging by the threads. Be careful with this place they make you think there taking care of you. The guy showed me the right size and there size. It was a big difference.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>They're honest, knowledgeable and friendly. It happens that they also carry the best tires available and have quite affordable prices. They usually have a promotion going on so its worth to ask. I drive about 35,000 miles a year on these great tires. In the last five sets I've purchased new from them I've never had a flat or slow leak. I highly recommend.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Ramzi took such great care of my car. Luis and Sebastian are wonderful and all work so hard to make sure you’re happy with everything your car needs. I have a Fiat 500, so it can be tricky. They always know what to do and do it professionally & honestly. You have a great team here! :)<//Text>

If you are looking for a reliable tire shop with amazing deals and prices look no more. In grand American tire they have high quality tires and the best staff in town. Everyone is super helpful and friendly. I was looking for some tires that many other places did not have. I recently recommended a close friend of mine to give them a try and he is also very pleased with his experience. I will definitely come back when needed</Review>

I recommend this business. Earlier this week, I was on the way to drop off a friend and I had a rear flat tire. No worries, I have a spare. I started driving again and… FLAT TIRE!  Luckily I was only a couple of miles away from their shop and managed to get there. I bought a new tire for a and they fixed the spare. Great staff, quick turnaround, and good prices.<//text>

Great service. I brought my vehicle in they assessed the proper alignment that it needed, repaired it in no time and now I’m considering buying new tires from them. I mean, I don’t really need them right now but they have such good deals going on that I might be back in a few days to get those tires!<//Review>

When the dashboard alerted us to a low tire pressure sensor malfunction, we stopped at Grand American Tires Physical Stores in Lancaster  because they were the closest tire shop to us at the moment. The manager there was incredibly helpful. He pulled a nail from the tire and plugged it! He also mentioned the tires are kind of old and gave us a good deal for a new set for whenever we decide to change them!<//text>

My son got his first car and I wanted to make sure he understand how important is to service the wheels and tires properly. It was a used car so we took it to Grand American Tire to get brand new ones. They went above and beyond explaining everything to my son. They talked about wheel alignment, wheel balance, the different types of tires and how everything affects the safety and performance of a vehicle. They deserve 10 stars!</text>

Once again Grand American Tire has helped us with our tire needs. This time we went in to get a set of tires for our daughter. They even had a promotion going on.  This is a professional, honest and knowledgeable crew that delivers beyond expectations. In the service industry where quality and experience are inconsistent, they never let us down.< /review>

For over five years, we have only taken our vehicles to Grand American Tire and Auto Repair whenever they are having a problem. Ramzi is always respectful, helpful, and fair. Repairs are completed in a reasonable amount of time, and there are never any surprise costs. I am thankful to have a trustworthy mechanic!< /Text>

This place is not a good business to buy your tires. I purchased a full set of tires and when I went back for service, they told me that I only purchase one tire for a trailer, bad business not recommend this place. Beware of this business they take your money and then they scam you.</review>

<review>There are plenty of tire shops in this area and I keep choosing this one because they have cheap tires without compromising quality. They also have great customer service. Last week I had hit a curb and my tire had a huge bulge and didn't want to drive on it, I went straight to their shop and they were more than happy to help!< /review>< pics>

The power steering pump quit on pickup truck that I use for work.
I took my vehicle to Grand American they gave me a quote which included the new part and the repair.
They had my vehicle up and running within 24 hours after dropping it off.
I have had no problems with it since.
I'm grateful for the great and quick job they did on my pickup truck.

I will be glad to revisit them again when the need arises.< /text>

I have used Grand American Tire for a while now and I can tell you this shop provides timely, fair-priced quality service. They are honest and professional. Not many places like this one! I’ve trusted Grand American tire and ther team with all of our vehicles because these folks know everything about cars and tires! I truly value their service and expertise. They are simply the best! If you haven't give them a try!</review>

Leaving work, call Grand American Tire, on the recommendation of a co-worker. They went to my house to verify the problem. They replaced old parts with new ones and left it working perfectly. I truly recommend them for the good service they offered me, it's a very good company!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Took in my car for an alignment after installing some top notch suspension.  I had ran over a nail on my way there from rosamond so I also needed a tire patched.  Both of which went really smooth.  This is the only place I will come to for alignments.  Been to them numerous times with civics and other cars.  Being lowered I’m limited on where I can go.  Thankfully these gentlemen always take care of me and give me nothing but top notch service!  Highly respectable group!  Thanks for always taking care of me and my wife when needed! 10/10 recommended!< /text>

This is the only place I will take my care for service.  They are very professional and understanding.  They go that extra mile to help.  My most recent experience was on Monday of this week.  I had an extended warranty on my car and was having a hard time getting through.  Mr. Ramsey{not sure of spelling} step right in and made the phone calls taking time out of his busy day.  Even if my warranty doesn't cover the service I will still have the work done there.  I recommend Grand American Tire to anyone who needs service.< /text>

This has got to be THEE BEST mechanic shop I've been to! I've been coming here for about 4 years about once a year, always for something different, but one thing that remains the same is their Tremendous customer service!!! The tire guy is great, I don't remember his name.. My Absolute Favorite though is definitely Ramesee!!! He is excellent! So thorough! In everything he does, and explains! The only slight downside, is the prices, but that's only to me, being a single mother of 4.. But the experience and the quality is service, is with every penny!! Awesome job, Grand American Tires!!</Text>

.I had a really good experience at Grand American Tire. Buying new tires can be exhausting, you can never tell if they`re giving you the best deal or just trying to sell more than what you actually need but I had a really smooth and different from others’ experience at Grand American Tire. I`m really satisfied with my new tires, my ride is very different now, no more weird noise while I`m riding.< /Text>

I always go to Grand American Tire when I need to change tires because it has a wide variety of brands of which I can choose which one is the best for my car model. for example, it has Goodyear, coopertires, Bridgestone, among others. In addition to that, it has low prices and offers such as the one I used recently to buy 4 coopertires tires and they gave me a $ 50 repaid card. they do a great job because they see that everything is according to the driving regulations. Thank you for everything Grand American Tire.< /review>

They took care of me immediately and diagnosed that my tires were outdated and for security purposes, I had to replace them. I barely had time to sit down and they had already changed them with new ones! The price was super decent, and they didn't try to upsell me. What a relief! Guess who I am calling first when it's time to change my tires again? Thanks for treating me right!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I had an accident recently and I needed to buy again all the tires for my car. As you can imagine, with all that I had to pay with the accident, I didn’t have now enough money to spend but I went to Grand American Tires and the discount tires are just as good as the others!<//text>

Awesome place my grandpa is a loyal customer of Grand America Tires, and it was enough for me to pay a visit. Reliable and honest staff who really do have your best interests at heart. That's hard to find these days in customer service. Need tires? Have questions about parts for your car? Give these guys a chance you wont be disappointed!</Text>

These guys are honest people! A different tire company showed me I had a nail in my tire and said it couldn't be repaired. They were going to charge me a lot for another tire but I checked around and Grand American had a better price. Then when I get to Grand American, they show me the nail hadn't even penetrated my tire! The other place was just trying to scam me. I fully recommend Grand American Tires and will be using only them in the future.<//text>

I will go to Grand American Tires from now on and encourage all my family and friends to go as well.  I needed four new tires.  I called every tire store in town.  Tim at Grand American Tires was exceptionally helpful.  He answered all my questions plus gave me added info on the quality and necessities of the the tires I needed.  His customer service was outstanding.  When I went to the tire store to get the tires put on, I was in there and out of there within an hour.  It was great.  Oh by the way, they had the best prices and warranty in town!!!!!
Thank you everyone at Grand American Tires</text>

Very nice. Excellent customer service. Prices are good. Stand by their work. I'm pleased and they also have a payment plan no credit needed but there is 50dollar initial pay to company that finances you. Fyi I don't work here or nothing, I'm hoping this can help someone who needs it. God bless<//text>

A few days ago I was driving on the street and when I stopped at a traffic light, a car drove over and crashed the taillights, causing them to break. Grand American Tire is my trusted car service, and I took the man who crashed my car there. They took care of painting the back of the car and replacing the broken glass. The man was impressed with the prices, he thought that the repair would be very expensive, and even he took advantage of the offers offered by the company and also repair his car. We were both satisfied with the results.< /review>

03-18-19 Purchased 4 Yokahama tires 235x65x16 seller ordered tires and called me when they were in, same day as ordered.  I arrived and seller was able to start immediately.  Install may have been 30 min and the tires were ready to go.  I had the wheels aligned that may have been another 30 min.  Seller pointed out other repairs that were not immediate but would be something to consider next visit.  Very happy overall, with the tire and service, seller help with financing and other advice.  Would recommend to friends and family.</Review>

<Review>Their Advertisement says it all. Best Price Anywhere...Why pay more? They really work  with you. I have never had a problem with any of my vehicles. I truly feel they take care of you the best they can. Or else they wouldn't have been in business so long. You ask they answer. If you don't like the answer well that's a different story. Thanks for taking care of my car.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>If you decide to choose this tire store , I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND  that you only ask for TIM!
The others especially Duke are a bit rude , & have issues if you show you have any automotive background. As to mean these other individuals can't pull a blanket over your head & feed you a bunch of non related repairs. If you have no clue what so ever about automotive or what their about, well Dukey is YOUR MAN!
PS when I had a set of tires put on my BMW, somehow the battery went DEAD, well I purchased a battery $200.00 mind you, and they made me install it! I was even on crutches with a broken heel! Again if this sounds like a Professional work ethic? Dukey is your MAN!
Want a honest professional with many years experience in all areas of automotive? Again TIM IS YOUR GO TO MAN!!< /Review><user_name>Scott Whitmore<//user_name>< time>

<Text>My tires were mounted backwards, (The inside label on all 4 tires were on the outside.) which caused my car to hydroplane excessively a month after I got them. When my mechanic noticed my tires were on wrong I called Grand American right away.  They tried to tell me it didn't matter, but according to the manufacturer's website it does.  They did correct the issue,  but never apologized.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>500 miles from home, the end of Thanksgiving weekend, about a half hour of daylight left, and I shred the oversized rear tire on my F150 truck.  Change to the spare and Palmdale for the night.  The next morning, first place I called, Costco, they have to order the tire.  Second place, had to order the tire. Third’s a charm, Grand American Tires in Lancaster had it in stock and Tim told me to come straight over.  When I arrived, I asked for Tim who was currently helping another customer.  I thought I was going to wait for Tim, but Duke told me to pull my truck into the bay, these guys actually talk to each other and they were ready for my arrival, tire and all.  Luis had the tire on in less than 20 minutes and even put the spare, not an easy task, back in the cradle under the truck bed.  These guys were professional, courteous, expeditious, fair, and funny to boot, exceptional customer service.  You’re thinking “dude”, nope, a female traveling with her elderly mother.  Sure, I can hold my own, but it is so very refreshing to find this level of respect and service in today’s world.  The kicker, I went to Costco first out of familiarity, the second choice was recommended from Costco, Grand American Tires, strictly out of reviews and ratings.  They deserve 10 stars and the patronage of every person reading this review.  Thank you gentlemen.<//Text>< pics>

<text>I am always taken care of I've been getting tires from grand American for 20 years from Mel at the newhall store when I lived down there. I was worried the first time I went to the Lancaster store because Mel always took such good care of me but he suggested I talk to Duke since he was closer I still stop and say hi when I'm down there but Duke is the man when I need tires or anyone I know needs tires I won't go anywhere else. You guys are the best thank you for everything.< /text>< Date>

Ramsey tried to sell us service we did not need and we watched has he made the same pitch to several customers who walked out.
