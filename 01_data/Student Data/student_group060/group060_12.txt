The store is big and allows ample space to move around comfortably using a shopping cart. They carry high end boutique items like Louis Vuitton, Michael Kors, Betsey Johnson just to name a few. Those items are kept behind the check out. The store is very organized and the staff is friendly and helpful.  Wednesday's are Senior citizens Day. 50%  off for Seniors 55yrs and older. So bring your mom, grandma to do some shopping.<//Text><userid>109576212273682947711< /userid><time>1611086726795</time></record>

<Name>Krista Lane</Name><time>1611956512977< /time><rating>5< /rating><review>I have found my experiences at URM Thrift quite favorable. My friend introduced me to URM this past summer 2020 . I have found some great finds.  From the boutique items, vintage pieces, toys, children's clothes, beauty items, clothes, to the  home goods.  The staff is professional and courteous.  A hello goes a long way and they are willing to speak to you when spoken to all socially distanced of course :)

Some items I do find with small holes, however it is easier to justify the purchase when you are paying at such a discounted rate (especially when they are having a 50% off sale).

I do enjoy listening to the Christian music (Hey I love KLOVE :)) I find myself singing while shopping it puts me in a good mood. The music may not be for everyone.  The music is positive and uplifting to me.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Due to the Covid-19, face cover is required. All the aisles are marked one-way to keep social distance. Floor of the checkout line is marked six foot apart. They do have some good bargains, like straw bag , 99 cent each. Some shoes are $14.99 if you can find your size. Ladies short boots $7.99.<//review>

< Review>
My daughter who is turning 3 on Tuesday found a Harley Quinn playhouse she loved. We took our daughter there allowing her to pick any toy she wanted, she was so proud of herself when she found the Harley Quinn toy. She proudly walked around the store with it; smiling and laughing. When we went up to the register to pay for it the price sticker fell off the toy RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WORKER! When we put the toy on the counter the worker said because the price tag fell off she could not allow my daughter to have it even though my husband found the price tag on the ground and gave it to her! The price of the toy was $4.99, we even offered to pay $10 for it but the worker said “sorry can’t.” And took the toy OUT OF MY CRYING TODDLERS HANDS! This store is absolutely ridiculous. We asked to speak to the manager and was told the manager was out of the store at that moment due to a personal issue. We will not be returning to this store. I do not recommend this store to anyone! A manager should be at the store while it’s open! Zero rating! My daughter did not deserve to be treated this way.</Review>

<text>BEST THRIFT STORE I'VE EVER FOUND!!

PLAN TO SPEND SOME TIME HERE AS CLOTHING ITEMS ARE SORTED BY TYPE NOT SIZE-
YOU WON'T GET THROUGH A FRACTION OF IT IN ONE VISIT..
INVENTORY IS WELL ROTATED AND HUGE!!

**50% OFF ENTIRE STORE, EVERY OTHER  WEEKEND**

CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!!
A+++ FOR QUALITY & QUANTITY</text>< pictures>

<Review>Went here today with my brother and niece. She picked out a $4.99 toy and it HAD the tag on it. She was playing with it and the tag accidentally fell off over by the register and the lady said “no tag, we can’t sell.” We told her that they tag was on it and we turned around and it was on the floor, we explained that and she still wouldn’t sell it to us. We got their policy but it had the tag on it when we first got it! It’s not our fault they put the tags on bad. Maybe get better tags. My niece was crying and saying “I picked it out myself” her heart was broken and so was mine and my brothers. We asked for the manager to explain and there was no manager. What kind of place is this?! I hope they fix future problems like this, to where it doesn’t happen again. So disappointed and will be taking our business other places. Never coming back!!!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I asked 3 employees if a certain item was on sale, all 3 answered "probably".  The discount signs on the wall did not specify which tags this sale applied to so I wanted to be sure. Other guests were also discussing amongst themselves that none of us could seem to get a full or courteous  response out of any of the employees:(  Not much more luck over the phone either.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I'm not sure if I was given the right name but she is on the thicker side and about 20 years old Hispanic with glasses . 10 minutes before closing as I'm looking at some things because I've never been in the store before. Young employee rudely tells me twice to head to the front of the store. She said sir go the other way toward the register when I was looking When I was just told by security I told her to calm down their store closes in 10 minutes. I did not raise my voice but she continued to argue back-and-forth with me. I told her I'll be sure to give her a good review sarcastically. She says "go ahead " rudely and I  asked her what's your name she says I'm not gonna Tell you go ahead tell my supervisor there right there. She follows me up to the register continue to argue with me and smiling like if it was a joke and she had nothing to worry about with her supervisors. I had never been so pissed in my life By an employee.  she said I wish they had audio tapes because I didn't do anything to you when we get to the supervisor and I told her why would I lie about you being disrespectful to me and arguing with me back and forth. She tried using reverse psychology with me In front of the supervisor after arguing with me saying go and tell the supervisor. It was so childish she was not apologetic or fearful of an supervisor or reputation  and I cannot believe the way she talked to me I told the supervisor that she should hire someone that's not going to fire at customers she's taking up space of someone that could be much sweeter and that really needs a job. It's  Union rescue Mission I don't know why she's working or a company that contributes to a good cause. The supervisor did give me 50% off and handled it professionally but the employee did not seem fearful at all or apologetic<//Review>< UserId.>

<username>Jeanine Zimmerle</username><text>Love this thrift store they always have cheap clothes. And some days they have brand new stuff
For example slip on crocs, Steven madden heels, Madden girl shoes
Just love this thrift, and for the people that really don’t have much money for clothes they can find them self a decent outfit. The only reason I didn’t give full stars is because I wish they had better furniture and more arranged kitchen supplies. Everything is just thrown in the back. It’s really nothing anyone can use.<//text>< Gmap_id>

It's a nice place. They are open 7 days a week. They have street parking out front and a parking lot in the back. There is no sales tax. It is clean and organized. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a restroom and a fitting room inside. They also have a lot of new items all the time.</Text>

Shoes for $29.99 even with the 50% off day their old worn in shoes are NOT worth it.  Zara shoes for $49.99. Steve Madden for $29.99 what the hell!? No name dresses for $16.99. Outrageous!  They seriously need to get a grip! They are a thrift store earning for charity.  They need to realize that.  I know my brands I realize that Zara, Jeffery Campbell, Steve Madden, etc are “name brands”.  But they need to realize they are selling used items and the scuffs and foot odor depreciates the value of their designer shoes.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I have been to a number of other thrift stores in the area and this is by far the best. You can tell the quality of merchandise is better.  It was started to create jobs and support the programs of Union Rescue Mission.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Well idk when to start , the people who works here thinks they’re supposed to be the customer’s parents because if you’re u see something u really like but it doesn’t have a price on it don’t bother to try to get it cus they won’t sell it to u because they said is fair for everyone but it isn’t and you’ll see when it happens to u. The manager is also really rude and so is everyone in this store</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Great place to view nature and bring your dog. If your into skateboarding there is also a skate park to skate or just watch some real talented skaters. Its a great place to walk and get in some exercise. Also to take pictures of the out doors if you your into that. There are bathrooms and a couple tables and bench to maybe enjoy a lunch outdoors . Over all its pretty safe and relaxing. 😌</Review>

I walked the trail behind the park from one end to the other. Lots of greenery and the creek made it perfect. The trash made this 4 stars. I don't understand why people think it's ok to just dump their waste wherever they want and not carry it to a bin of some sort. Their mothers are not going to pick it up after them.< /Text>

It's a great place to tire out your little pal. There's 2 sides, the big dogs and the little dogs. It's also very secure.< /Review>

Huge dog park with large separate spaces for small or timid dogs vs. Large dogs. Benches and chairs for humans, water for dogs, even a sandbox. Free parking and a skateboard park next door. Excellent facility!</Text>

Better than any other dog parks within an hour or twos drive.
Wardlaw is just a gorgeous park. I almost always end up chit chatting or in conversation with other friendly dog owners. It's not snooty as far as I can tell, people often clean more than their share, no one has gotten upset at barking dog's.
It's a very nice place to spend a few minutes or a few hours with your four legged bark buddies.
Bring your own sanitizer spray. Bags are biodegradable but dificult to open, one kind lady taught me to rip open a small tear at the top to find/create a separation point.
Lots of regulars seem well aquatinted with each other and even if they don't know the humans names, they'll know each other's dogs names.
It's ideal for me as I cannot walk them due to physical limitations.
I can make it walking from one chair location to another and thereby get in a little extra exercise myself. If you don't have painful limitations that doesn't seem like a big deal but it is a great set up for me and a perfect match for my needs. I'll get some better photos, these are only by the very front in the small side. It isn't an accurate representation on how nice it is.<//text>< GmapID>

Friendliest dog park yet and very beautiful. We stopped while traveling and found a large group of happy dog owners enjoying themselves as if it was a party. Easy parking, separate entrances for big or small dogs, poop cleanup stations, in park water station, lovely green grass, shade trees and clean benches<//Text>

Since I've moved to Vallejo with my dog Lil'Buddy, finding a dog park has been hard. Till I came across Wardlaw Park. This enclosed dog run is amazing! I've never been to a dog park this clean and grassy before! Lil'Buddy made a lot of new friends on our first day there and I met many new people too. :)<//Review>

I just recently relocated from Southern Oregon, my dog has grown up running around in the woods, dog parks not so much. I love how tidy it is with its green grass and nice fencing and just how dog friendly it is! You can tell the people that use this park care about their animals as well as others. I don't know who's more excited about this new found pet playground, myself or my pooch?!< /Review>

<text>Nice big dog park. My only complaint is that owners could pick up after their dogs better. They provide everything you need to do so all around the park. It's unfortunate that some people make it unpleasant for all by their lack of respect.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

On-leash nature trail nearby. Notes: Parking can be problematic around 2:30-3pm as parents park illegally here instead of picking up from the school lot, and the park is closed for maintenance until 2pm on Weds, But otherwise its excellent.< /text>< Date>

Great dog park! Just a suggestion here but don't come in the park with a dog in heat and take them off the leash before you enter the park.</Review>

<Text>I have been to a LOT of dog parks, and this is one of the nicest I've seen. I stop whenever I'm in the area, and it's always in excellent condition. The surface is grass. The large dog park is built on a gentle slope, which I think helps it drain so the turf doesn't get muddy and torn up from rain. (And then patchy and dusty in summer.) The slope and irregular shape make it more interesting than the typical flat rectangle, and there's a path around the perimeter. The people and dogs I've met have all been friendly. Plenty of parking, double gate, small & large dog sections, water, poop bags, and good fencing. Just a pleasant place for your dog and you.< /Text>< pictures>

Park is well maintained.
People are very friendly and most dogs are not aggressive. This dog park has two sides, one side for small the other for larger breeds. Lots of trash can located around the facility to drop off your dogs waist. The park is closed on Wednesday AM till 2PM for maintenance.<//review>

Best dog park in the area. Two sizable areas, one for larger dogs and one for smaller and/or timid dogs.
There is also a VERY nice skate park for young and old.  Good crowd there of all ages and genders.
The walking trail is nice and scenic too!<//Review>

<Review>So there are a few things going on here that everyone needs to be concerned about. This is a local hangout for drug dealers. They are always right next to the state park prtion of the park. Also the dog park and restrooms are very poorly kept up. In very poor condition as if no one ever cleans or manages them at all. If you need a dog park there is a better one right inside American canyon by McDonald's.<//Review>< Date>

<review>Nicely maintained dog park, especially for Vallejo.  Lots of space for your unleashed dog to play.  Busiest after 5:00 on weekdays, and 1:00 on weekends.< /review>< Response>

Cute and big enough for any dog. I just thought it was weird how all the humans just sit in chairs all lined up.< /Review>

The best place to hangout with your four-legged freind! A good mixture of like-minded people along with a couple of occational crazies (not talking about the dogs). On a nice day you could easily be there for hours. Dog watching is so much better than people watching.</Text>

<Review>This dog park is great! There's two sides, one for the big dogs and one for the small. Both sides are very spacious! There's chairs for the humans to sit. Lots of people bring their dogs everyday, I've never seen it empty! Heads up though, once I started bringing my pup here she came home with lots of fleas. Just make sure you have your furry friend on some prevention!< /Review>< time>

Great, well maintained dog parks (one for little and old dogs) and a big one for larger dogs.) Also creekside walking trail and skate park nearby.</Text>

My son and I love this skatepark but it is not swept much and not given as much attention as the dog park. This is tragic. The children are the future. Act like it.< /Review>

This park is actually really peaceful, it has nice trees with lots of shaded benches, it has a skate park, a dog park, and a trail that runs through hans park. I go here almost every day.</Review>

<Date>1481394615673<//Date><Rating>2</Rating><Text>I used to go there a lot but the last few times I've had bad enough experiences for me to make the decision not to bring my dogs there again.

As with any dog park there are rules. These get broken. My biggest problem is when intact males come in. This causes aggression of that dog and other dogs causing fights. My neutered dog was attacked.

When my friendly, submissive, socialized (SPCA), puppy was attacked that was the last time I ever went there. This huge  Malamute/Great Pyranese looking dog attacked him. Where was the owner? As my dog is on his back in a completely submissive posture this big Bear of a dog is biting his private parts (1 part) as he was neutered. My dog is crying in pain and I'm screaming for the owner who finally walked over and stood there not reaching to grab his dog. Finally with me yelling for him to grab his dog he did. Then he walked back to his little group as if nothing happened.

I was so mad everyone heard me as I was leaving. I now go to a different dog park with no problems.< /Text>< Pictures>

I get to eat here a lot since I work in the area. I must say their service is always awesome and they keep the place well kept constantly. Pricing is fair and they serve generous portions.</Text>

Great place for parties, large event center, you can rent out whole saloon or sections, large restrooms for multiple people at one time, very clean, kitchen area, large windows, gas stage down the street, variety of restaurants next door, large parking lot.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food was very tasty but more employees were needed, there were only 2 employees when I went and they were in charge of living people, attending the tables and charging

The service and good were awesome.   It looks like a pretty small place from the outside, but they have a lot of seating, even on the patio.   They have a great selection of Mexican and American food.    The food was delivered to our table quickly and had a fresh flavor to it and a good serving size.    This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant in town.   Great beer selection also.   Beer is only in bottles. But reasonable prices.< /text>

The garlic fries were awful. My shrimp is over cooked. My fries are All stuck together. My beef taco and pork burrito is EXTREMELY salty. I ordered from you guys before so this is just disgusting.</text>

The chamoy around the rim was homemade and licking the side of your cup was irresistible...I seriously couldn't get enough! Add the shrimp to the micheladas es muy rico!  Patio seating was nice TVs and music were great. Shrimp and fish tacos were cooked to perfection.<//Text>

Unfortunately I can only give a 2*. This establishment cooks every thing with pork and lard. I can't eat either 😔 However they were incredible in service, humble with an apology, and held no grudge as I lift. For those who can eat food with pork or pork byproducts I would recommend this place on character alone 👍😇</text>

The food was amazing & great flavor! I will most definitely be coming back. The only thing I was concerned about was the birria taco, it  was a little heavy handed on the salt. My kids enjoyed their meals they wanted to come back again!!! Thank you so much we had such a blast here!! 😇🤩🤩🤝🙏<//text>

There have been recent price changes to the menu on DoorDash. They are not intended to be consumer friendly. It seems the intention is to clear out anyone who isn’t willing to spend an average of $20 through delivery services. It’s also disappointing to see their more affordable options such as the burrito and fries be removed from the menu.
Anyways, If you’re looking for a place to eat and can afford it I definitely recommend it.
Delicious food and respectable portions!< /Review>

The chicken mole was ok,  the mole sauce was very tasty with the fresh made corn tortillas, however, the chicken was very dry. In my opinion if they used thigh meat the chicken mole would be 100% delicious. The service was good very nice waitress.< /text>

I go almost every Tuesday. They offer great service and you really can't bear $1 tacos. If you like frescas, I recommend the green one. Always great.<//Text>

We got there a half hour before they closed but the waitress Jocelyn treated us so nice. She was friendly, sweet and paid great attention to us.

We would go back just for her! She said they have an excellent breakfast so we'll be going there Saturday. Can't wait to try the chillaquilles and the Nutella French toast!</text>< Pics>

We were referred to try this spot by Javier at R&B Auto Center Fontana! I’m so glad we did. I had the Quesabirria tacos and they were delicious! There’s a very nice private outdoor patio with big TV’s so we got to watch game 3 of the World Series. We will be back.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>This place is VERY expensive. The food is decent, however their prices are very high for not being a restaurant. Spent $60 one day and another $40 another day. I mean, $14 for chicken enchiladas that comes with no drink? I would rather drive further down to Miguel's Jr, which is a lot cheaper and their combos come with drinks. I could have gotten the exact same thing for under a lot less! Never coming back here again.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Love this place! The food is fantastic. Everything I've ordered tastes homemade. Everyone is friendly and the service is top notch. I've been there with just my wife and been there with a group of ten and the service is awesome. This is one of my new favorite restaurants.<//Review>

Unfortunately our visit wasn't great. Heard a lot about this place, and decided to celebrate my birthday here. Bad choice as far as service. Food was great, and price was also great. They only had 1 waitress for 10 tables. Felt bad for the lady<//text>

I'm glad that I found a place near me that serves breakfast all day. It was a simple burrito but the melty cheese brought back a childlike joy in my heart. I did the takeout option but I got a decent look at the place. Smallish restaurant and the atmosphere didn't wow me but it was nice enough and I liked it. Will definitely come back to try out new things. Also bonus points for giving me mini salsas and ketchup to try with my burrito. I didn't even know that I wanted it but I was glad when I found out. :)<//review>

The food is great. They do need an extra waiter. The girl there was alone with 20 customers. Torta cubana was good. My wife tried the Torta Milanesa and was really happy with it. The cook's really put there heart in to it.</review>

My friend and I rolled up not knowing they were closed. Even though, the 2 guys there who were in the process of locking up decided to stay and agreed to at least have our meals made to-go.

If you have a special occasion or you just want to be treated to the best meal of your life visit Fleming's. We love this place. The service is amazing. The steaks are cooked to perfection and the sides are delectable. I love the Fleming's potatoes!< /text>

It was decent.  I got the mild chicken wings and fries. The wings were breaded, and the food was hot. It was decent. I don't think I'll go back, but not because of anything other than I don't live in the area. It's not worth my time to go out of my way to get there.
My husband got street tacos, and those seemed to be pretty good according to him. I tasted the meat, and the chicken and the asada both tasted good to me.< /review>

This place is amazing. First of all their customer service is outstanding, they have the best actitud and make you feel welcome. Now the food was hoot. I had a shrimp cocktail that was one of the best I had in a long time. My husband has some asada tacos. He enjoyed them to the point that he wants to come back Soon!!!!! Now I wasn’t expecting that a Mexican food place can make good hot wings but they where absolutely incredible. I also had the michelada with the two beers OMG!!!! We are definitely coming back. Love this place.< /Text>

<Review>This place is a go to when I'm in a mood for home style Mexican food and I don't want to bug my mom. I've brought my dad here before (the biggest critic of Mexican food) and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Their chilaquiles in particular is one thing I regularly crave.<//Review>< pics>

I've gotten a carne asada burrito many times from here. Today i order a carne asada burrito. First bite, got meat... The rest, just a rice burrito with a bit of beans. No asada what so ever!! 3/4 of my burrito was rice! Completely disappointed.</text>

Wonderful service. Food was pretty good. Definitely earned the name. The shrimp diablo quesadillas were spicier than expected but sweet at the same time. Salsas could use a lil more flavor. Micheladas were great<//Review>

The food and service were great.  We had a little bit of everything.  The portions were big and filling.  Tortillas are freshly handmade and delicious. Refried beans were seasoned almost like charros.  They start you off with chips and salsa.  You can order appetizers ranging from hot wings and supreme nachos, to queso fundido.  Good selection of sea food.  You can get plate combos or a la carte items like tacos.  The tacos are pretty big too.  Cleanliness was good, plenty of seating, four TV's playing sports.  Family friendly, they provide a kids menu.  Great flavors, I'm coming back.<//Text>

Place was nice and clean, attentive personnel that took our order, Cynthia. Food was pleasing to the eye, and pleasing to the palate. I had the carne asada torta, does not come with any hot sauce, you need to ask for some to give it some spice. I asked for the green hot sauce which was tasty. My daughter had a grilled chicken sandwich and she enjoyed it. My husband went for the wet burrito, which tasted ok, but the red sauce used to "wet" the burrito was a bit on the strong side. Not hot spicy, but just a bit too much.  I feel that the deeper the color the more heavy on the taste. It kind of gave it a taste that it came from a powder chili...not necessarily fresh chiles.  My husband stated that the beans might have been from a can, but he might be wrong.  Don't get me wrong, it was ok, but probably will not be ordering the wet burrito in the future if we return.
Prices were average for the food compared to Mexican restaurants. Fountain drinks we're a bit on the flat side.
Other than that place was ok for our first time trying it out.< /Text>

I called around 4pm and the woman who answered spoke so quickly I couldn't understand her. I asked if I could place an order and she just hung up on me without a word. Very rude. I've never tried the food, so I don't think it's fair to leave 1 star for that.< /Text>

<Text>Food is okay but the young waitress is horrible. Had to ask 3 times for more salsa and 2 times for more lime. As soon as i asked she went to go pour herself a cup of water and then got on her phone. At that point  i felt like getting up and leaving.<//Text>< Pics>

<rate>3</rate><review>We walked in just before the lunch hour  (on a Wed) the music was a bit too loud and to carry on a conversation, you have to speak loud! Went to wash my hands and the trash can was full (it's the lunch hour, how busy have they been!)... So we ordered their spinach and pineapple water and it was deliciously perfect!!!  Then we ordered their Chile Verde (salty, very salty) it was sent back and ordered Huevos Rancheros, once again super salty.  We kept the ordered but basically just ate the beans. Their Chile Relleno plate was good, the next plate was an Enchilada Verde and Chile Relleno, still too much salt but we did not send the plate back, once again, the beans and rice were good.  Last plate was an order of Chilaquiles Verdes with scramble eggs and beans.  Surprise, they were extremely SALTY!! Send them back because they were super salty and they served me Chilaquiles with red sauce, when we ordered the green sauce.  They replaced the Chilaquiles with their Torta de Carne Asada and it was delicious!!!  When the bill came, they graciously removed the plates that were sent back.  Other than that....they get 3 stars but more than likely will not return to The Hot  Spot.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>“Corky's is Ummm Ummm GOOD!”
When we first visited Corky's in Fontana, we were not sure what to expect. We thought that it was just another small franchise in Fontana. Well, were we pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is all down to earth family. The restaurant décor adds to that atmosphere. Corky's also specializes in "Home Made Pies". They offer a variety of pies. My favorite..<//Review>< date>

Service is ok. The food is about average nothing crazy. They did how ever take a while despite there being no one at the location. Yelp reviews may be a bit misleading just a heads up.< /Review>

<name>Elisabeth Campos</name><Text>We are moving across the country to Irvine in a little over a month, and found a great listing at Avella earlier this week that we knew would be perfect for us.  Melissa at in the leasing office set up a virtual tour for us, met us on FaceTime, and gave us a thorough tour of the home and showed us around the community.  She was so wonderful, and even gave a great impression by staying masked the entire tour, which helped us feel more confident that Avella is a safe community to move into during this pandemic. In 24 hours, Melissa had our application approved.  What a smooth, effortless process!  All thanks to Melissa being so open to help us and being so prompt with communication. We are relieved to have a great place waiting for us when we drive out to California next month!  Thank you again!</Text><userid>102399146204149829005<//userid>< rating>

I've lived here a little over 2 months and have no complaints. I looked at a few Irvine Company apartments and one of the main reasons we went forward with a lease at Avella was due to Randy. Randy was amazing throughout the whole process and staying in contact every step of the way. He made moving in (especially during a pandemic) so incredibly easy.

In regards to the community itself-it is so nice! The community is quiet, friendly and well kept. I have never had any issues with parking no matter what time of day I return. We've had minor maintenance issues but  everything was completed within the same day. Avella is a really enjoyable community to live in.</text>

<text>This review is mostly about David in the leasing office! He helped navigate us through a transfer to a different unit within Avella mid-lease. What would have been a very long and complicated process, David made so easy and pleasant by being so attentive, high-spirited, and knowing just the right amount of support to lend. He's also extremely responsive to emails, which is a huge plus. He gets back to you really quick, answers questions thoroughly, and just has good overall energy! :)< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We had the pleasure of working with Megan Ryan from Avella Apartment Homes. Although we ended up moving to a home, our experience with Megan has been nothing but awesome. She is very professional and detail-oriented, and her communication is excellent. It is unfortunate that we didn't make Avella our new home, but we were very happy with the service given to us by Megan. Thanks, Megan for all you did for us during our home search! Much appreciated!<//review>

<username>Robert Vargas<//username><time>1572113972949<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>I have lived at Avella for almost 4 years. I have leased a 1BR, 2BR and their “Condo” unit. Although I am one that is attracted to cost savings and being conscious with my spending, I have never thought twice about renewing my lease nor paying higher than the “market rate” for similar properties in my area. The value at Avella far exceeds the cost. The service is also something that you cannot buy or replicate at Avella. Maintenance technicians have always been attentive and made minor repairs in a very timely manner. The leasing staff is also well trained and I know many of them on a first name basis. Sandra’s leadership as the assistant manager has definitely set the tone of service in the community. She has been there to support me as a resident as I have undergone many life changes and has proven to me that she cares! You don’t often find that at apartment communities. Luke is a newer representative in that office and he is another rockstar. I have made several inquiries through my stay at Avella and he has never let me down with follow up correspondences and has always followed through. The amenities sell themselves...take a look at Avella and then take a look at the apartments down the street (you will understand what I’m talking about).< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We’ve lived here for three years and from the moment we walked into the leasing office we were welcomed with such hospitality especially coming from a different area with a different culture. Sandra has been such a gem to work with, very knowledgeable and personable. The overall Avella community is well put together from the front lines of the leasing office and maintenance crew, they have all been professional and take care of any situation in a timely manner. Can’t wait to see what events and new additions are in store for our community!< /Text>

This is my first experience of living on my own and Randy Martinez was able to help me through the entire move in process and make it so easy and not stressful at all, which is amazing with everything going on with COVID right now. Great community and conveniently close to Irvine Spectrum, Costco, 5 freeway, and a great shopping center with many food places and grocery stores like Nekter, Chipotle, The Counter, Ralphs, and Trader Joe’s!

<Text>DO NOT DEAL WITH ANGELICA NAVARRO.

My 1 year lease there was great all the way up until the move out process. It's hard to speak about anything positive about this place when you are left with a bad taste in your mouth upon leaving.

My lease was up on 3/13/2020. On 1/22/2020, I signed their agreement to continue month to month as I was in the process of purchasing a home. The Avella team mentioned that in order to NOT incur any costs, that I'd have to provide a 30 day notice. I formally emailed Avella on 2/13/20 letting them know that I will be moving out on 3/14/20 (which was a complete 30 day notice given that February had 29 days). Angelica emailed me back inquiring whether I wanted to move out on 3/13/20 which is my "original/initial" lease end date. This was the start of COVID-19. Due to high stress from the uncertainty of this pandemic, I didn't pay attention to whether she was trying to manipulate me into a rent responsible charge.

Upon receiving my move out statement, I noticed I was charged 1 day rent responsible which almost amounted to $100. I was shocked and appalled! Never had the leasing team mentioned that I would incur these costs and based on the 30 day notice contract, that option was not selected. I attempted to come to agreement with Angelica when this was realized and she was completely unpleasant and unsympathetic stating that the leasing team does not have time to notify people of this charge. How is that even possible? Every time I go into the leasing office, I see each member of their team on Google Hangouts. If they have time to chat amongst one another, they should have time to ensure their tenants know the costs that will be incurred. Not to mention that their move-out inspection WAS A JOKE. I scheduled my move-out inspection immediately when I received their notice to schedule and they had to reschedule on me. I had to take time out of my work schedule to make sure I was home for the move out inspection. Once the move out inspection was completed, I was told I would be sent the inspection document when the person gets to a place with wifi. THIS NEVER HAPPENED. I actually had to email the leasing office to get a copy of this. Imagine how shady this place feels?!

I would never recommend Avella to anyone. In fact, I've recommended them to Cadenza or Amalfi as they seem to care more about their tenants. For those interested, my lease at #1817 was $2,150 for a 1 bedroom apartment. At my lease renewal, they increased it by 6% or to $2,280 (12 month) or $2,360 (16 months). That's a huge increase for just 1 year. Their community is not worth that sort of increase when their amenities are just OK, when they don't keep up with landscaping, when they do not acknowledge you when you tell them that specific tenants do not pick up their dogs sh*t, or when there's a ton of construction being built for low income families causing noise during times that they are not allowed to do construction.

Save your money and go down the street to Cadenza. I heard that Sandra is now a manager over there and she was a pleasure to work with while she was at Avella. If you're a person that loves amenities and to want a bang for your buck, I'd check out Amalfi in Tustin.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>I’ll start off this review saying that, until recently, living at Avella has been a fantastic experience.  It’s quiet, clean, well kept, has fantastic amenities, maintenance requests are taken care of in a timely manner - everything you could ask for in an apartment community/home.  However, the reason for my less than favorable review is because our lease is being terminated due to our building being re-designated as “not pet friendly.”

All of this would be understandable if Irvine Company/Avella would be more accommodating due to the nature of the request.  The only thing the Irvine Company will help us with is by waiving the “transfer fee” for moving to either a new unit or a new community.   There are currently no other open apartments that are of the same floor plan as the one that we are on.  We also love our location and there doesn’t appear as if there’s another unit on site that is comparable.

Furthermore, there are a handful of other locations that have availability with floor plans we like but we were told that if we want to move to an entirely new community (even though it’s an Irvine Company owned property) that we would have to wait until our lease expires.   It feels like we are being forced to pick a less than favorable location so we don’t end up without a place to live after our lease expires.  You would think that a better plan would be in place when forcing tenants to move to an entirely new location than waiving a transfer fee and acting like we are being done a favor.  Unacceptable.

Avella/Irvine Company Apartments this is extremely disappointing.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

We just moved out of Avella and how glad we are in having done so.  I will say first and foremost that maintenance at Avella is great.  No complaint as they do a great job.  Perhaps "management" should take a cue from the maintenance team.  After move out, we got a bill for 500+ dollars for replacing the cheap plastic flooring they put in this place.  There were about 12 pieces that were defective and curling up.  They pinned it on us and said that 54 pieces had to be replaced and charged us for it.  We asked for proof but they never sent any pictures documenting this ruse.  What a joke!!

As this is a non smoking community, I complained several times about neighbors who are habitual smokers who disregard the non smoking aspect of living at Avella and each time they got a slap on the wrist...."Don't do it again!".  If you are seeking a non smoking community, don't move here!!!  More people smoke here than at the no preference communities.  It is absurd that non smoking is not enforced here but it seems like the rule here is that as long as Avella is getting paid they don't want to rock the boat, but if you owe one dollar or management wants what it wants then you are bullied into immediate action.  We originally signed here because they said and promoted (during initial leasing) that they were going to have a dog park.  I spoke with several other (NOW PAST) residents who said they signed because of this too, yet no dog park ever showed up.  I was told by Cassie about 6 months ago that indeed the dog park was in the works and that was a big lie!  I will tell you right now to get everything in writing from the Irvine company as they are liars.  I have been lied to by the management of two communities now.

We did enjoy our apartment aside from the (undocumented, no photo proof given to us) plastic flooring charge that they stuck us with to cover for the poor quality workmanship on this apartments.  Some neighbors we got to know told me they peeked into their unit before it was finished and saw a tequila bottle on the counter.  Nothing says quality work like drunk construction workers.  All in all, I would take a pass on this place!!  Although it is a shame that some people don't feel the need to pick up after their pet, apparently management didn't see fit to have someone keep the community clean either.  Completely unsanitary!!  And many residents just left trash by the trash can instead of putting it in the receptacle. I will add, three kids are frequently unsupervised in the pool areas, screaming and carrying on and nothing done despite this being a liability for Avella.  These same boys getting free hot chocolate and spilling in on the sidewalks and staircases, and being generally dirty and unruly. Yet no action taken whatsoever!

The only good thing I can saw about Avella and its management team at this point is that I don't have to see or deal with the problems of this place having left it. Having spoke to about 10 residents who got nominal rent increases at lease renewal time, the Irvine company definitely targets some they want out with complete and utter inequality of rent increase price gouging.  No matter, we weren't interested in staying anyways and seeing how many people are leaving here this like the place is emptying out so people aren't taking the bait.  I guess this will give management more time to do nothing in running this place properly.  Good luck and good riddance!!

P.S.  ANTS EVERYWHERE!!!<//Review>

< Review>
This place is great. It has a sprawling junior Olympic-sized pool, in-door washer and dryer, central air, an ant infestation, thin walls (use your imagination), blind corners, no parking for residents, garages that aren't used for cars but offices or play areas, front seat access to road-side audio (if you're lucky you can catch one of the 2am Irvine gang super-car races), residents that don't respect lease agreement terms, and a corporation that refuses to enforce them. I felt so welcomed, my first week they unjustly threatened to evict me with over a minor payment error in the initial signing phase. After putting me through intense stress they offered a pittance ($10 vouchers and cookies... I'm not three) and continue to address concerns in this insulting way. This will be my last Irvine Company apartment. The apartment complex reflects Irvine's Company's appreciation for the city--everything is for show.<//Review>

<rating>3</rating><review>It's convenient and not really busy. The customer service has been good but the location is a little creepy. It just attracts homeless people but they do try to chase them away. Never been inside but usually the trash outside is always over flowing when I've been in the drive through.<//review>< Pictures>

First time I ordered a cheesy core box, only to find my cheese core burrito was a beefy crunch burrito. The second time my grilled stuffed burrito ended up being a burrito supreme. Maybe it's a sign I should go somewhere other than Taco Bell, but you guys just lost a loyal customer. Go to Arsenio's for your grease fix, unless you like paying a premium for utter crap.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1472194553513< /Date><user_name>Bryan Pretzer<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Was driving  through and needed a restroom so i stopped here, I was greeted by a pleasant man named Richard who also served my Fruitista... You just don't see customer service like he gave me often!  Great employee!< /review>

Staff is really nice and will help you with your trash -almost like table service. The mono rail will be forcing them to close at some point.< /review>

My husband and I were very pleased with the cleanliness of the property as well as the way management is running that particular office. We were so comfortable with everything that we paid a couple of months in advance. If you are looking for somewhere to safely store your belongings...this is the place!!< /review>

Lacy went the extra mile and saved me a ton of money.  I wanted to pay for a year up front to park my sons vehicle and she assured me to just pay a few months and that was exactly all I needed it for. Her customer service is amazing and she is definitely in the correct business and cares about her customer's!! Thank you for your amazing service!<//Review>

Lacy does one heck of a job running this place. It’s clean, well-kept, well lit and safe. Every time I talk with Lacy she gives me the best customer service ever. The sizes of storage units are good too, and they’re affordable. You’ll like how tall the ceiling is. I give this place a 10!</Text>

Last minute reservation , unlike these other storage facilities who need 48hrs to get you a spot , Lacy at this I-Storage literally went above and beyond for our family and took care of us and our belongings within a few hrs. Hard to find a good manager like lacy who keeps her property clean and secured. Plus they are going High-Tech to make our experience at their facility a great one. You will NOT find any other storage facilities in town with the gate hours they have which make it easier for any schedule you have to get in or get out especially if you keep your hunting/fishing vessels in  the yard<//Text>

Super friendly, fast, great rates. Definitely came through in a pinch. Would have given 5 stars but the advertising for 1st month free turned out to be 50% off instead...Went to pay the next month and was greeted with a smile and helped to set up auto pay.<//Review>

Total hands on and always there to make sure I get what I need done. Thank you for the help. Clean and tidy. Great lighting and security cameras. They will work with you if you need help. Best place in town. Never any problems here or with people who rent here. All around great place.

Lacy was the lady who helped us with our storage rooms.  She was helpful and easy going on which size of room for us.  The price is fair and the first month is free of charge.  For sure in the future, an upgrade to a bigger room.  I recommend anyone who was or is thinking about renting a storage room.</text>

<Time>1548800356303</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Nice and clean place. After the fire we needed a place to put some belongings we were able to take with us as well as all the donations we received and this place had a wait list. The manager on site was so friendly and comforting for me and my family. Felt like we knew her for awhile. Very sweet and nice. Lindsey said she would put us on a list and call us as soon as she had 1 open. Took some time but she kept her word with us. She called us as soon as a unit opened up and my husband came down and did the paperwork and we got a unit. Thank you. Thank you for helping us in the time of need and thank you for keeping your word. That says a lot about a person as well as a manager. You guys are lucky to have her. Thank you again and god bless.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809cb5985d436975:0x62aff2e2f2f4e1df<//gmapID></record>

Clean and tidy facility. Property is always clean and well put together. Yes a little pricey but worth it. You walk in and they have their cameras right there in the office which makes you feel safe. The staff is friendly and the manager is awesome. Lyndsey is very professional and kind. Very knowledgeable and not pushy. Makes you feel comfortable and welcomed always. I will continue to rent here. Thank you<//Review>

Lacey is a great professional and an asset to the company of a magnitude that will probably be unrecognizable unless people like myself express this.
I just cannot tell you what her helping me and my wife made, because of her efforts we have faith that we can have our belongings without losing our things.
Thanks for your help Tracey<//text>

<review>Lacy is the best Property Manager ever! She helped my family find the perfect storage unit. We had a unit at this location already and needed a larger unit. Lacy went beyond the extra-mile and helped us get a unit that was not only larger, but close to our older unit making the transition smooth and easy. And she saved us money in the process!!! I'd give her ten stars if I could. I've never been treated so good at a storage facility and I've had a lot of storage units.</review>< user_name>

Lindsay was a massive help!  Awesome customer service!  She was able to help me with my "unique" situation timely and professionally. I've used this facility before when it was under different management and I absolutely hated it. Now this iStorage is my go to for all my storage needs. Highly recommended!</text>

<review>Great facility. Clean and tidy as well. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed available. Lyndsey the property manager assured me she will keep me on the list and call me as soon as one comes available. She was so precise and very knowledgeable.

< review>
Where do I start?!? I've used many storage companies in the past and I've never been as impressed as I am currently. Lindsey is what makes this a great experience. I reside in Boise, Idaho. My mother has recently relocated from Oroville to Boise and is storing her belongings with iStorage in Thermalito. Lindsey has been beyond gracious, kind and accommodating. It's obvious she cares for her customers. She is an asset to this company. Thank you,  Lindsey! You're the best!!< /review>

<Text>I read all these amazing reviews an was hoping to meet the wonderful Lyndsey I read about. Come to find out that it wasn't going to happen was disapointing. The people were nice, but didn't seem to like their job at all. No pep in step or nice greeting. That wasn't the reason we chose not to rent here though we choose not to rent here due to your pricing. We lost our home in paradise and were on a fixed income and your prices are extremely high. I was told if I couldn't afford it that they're were cheaper ones around but you get what you pay for. So that's whats my wife and I did. I know your corporate but you need to be more mindful of prices. This is oroville. Alot of people in this town can't afford your prices and it's not like you don't have what alot of other peole have in town. So good luck with all of that.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

AMAZING!!! My family and I lost our house in Magalia when the fire hit and we were so lost and didn't know what to do. With what he had we got a unit and Lyndsey the property manager was there and were so thankful for her. Not only was she kind and supportive and a great listener she helped us get a great deal and made us feel comfortable and our belongings safe. Forward months later we finally were able to find our forever home and we moved our things out. Easy process and again lyndsey was there to hel every step of the way. Thank you lyndsey for everything. Your a rockstar!!!<//Review>

<text>Went to get a few things to bring back w/me to Washington. On Friday the 5th of April I was locked out because no payment was not paid on the 1st, in my acct it says to draw payment on the 3rd of the month. They failed to do that on the third so locked out I was, it was a good thing they were in the office, cause I would have been very mad, not being able to get in. The payment is to be made by the 10th of the month. So why did they think to do a lock out, this time?</text><rate>3</rate>< userid>

Convenient location & budget friendly for my family. My husband and I have been renting from this facility for more years than I can remember (10 years, I believe!) and the manager, Shelli, is very friendly, is always in a happy mood & always there for you. We feel secure renting from American Self Storage. They have electronic gates, recorded video surveillance, bright lighting, convenient office hours & facility times. Best all around. I would definitely recommend AMERICAN SELF STORAGE! P.S. Today 10-3-14, I just rented our 2nd unit from Shelli. Thank You Shelli for making the experience so easy!</review>

<Text>I found myself mesmerized by the knowledge and experience of this young site manager. Lindsey was professional and yet still personable enough to make my family feel very comfortable and welcome. Which is important to me to feel the trust of leaving our possessions in her storage facility. All of our questions were answered with complete knowledge and fast. There was no lagging. The place was clean, well lit, AND SECURE. We are in the campfire area and I will be referring many people from the fire to istorage here and the Oroville one on 5th st (We went there first but he dident have one large enough for our needs. So he called Lindsey himself and arranged for us to go right over. I definately recommend istorage 1st.< /Text><UserId.>106086421537334312116< /UserId.>< Response>

In addition to computerized gate access, security cameras, and the sale of high-security locks, we require all our tenants to carry coverage on their stored property. We offer SecureLease, a property protection plan, to all our tenants. This optional protection plan offers no deductible and low monthly premiums. Among the perils covered are theft, limited damages due to infestation, and water damage from roof leaks, windstorm (non-named storms), and broken pipes. Some of our tenants choose to protect their goods through coverage provided by their homeowner’s policies. It is up to our tenants to check with their insurance agent to ensure that their goods are covered while being stored offsite. We also remind all our tenants that that homeowner’s policies carry a deductible and may not provide coverage for all the perils listed above. Regardless, it is your choice. If you choose to provide your own insurance, a policy declaration page is usually sufficient to provide proof of coverage.'}< /Resp>

The gentleman who answered checked availability at the thermalito facility which had a 10x30 for $99, almost half of what other facilities we're charging. The young lady who works at the thermalito facility was very friendly and helpful and I was set up in no time. This was helpful, after moving 400 miles to find out the house I was supposed to get wasn't ready, I needed storage fast. Thanks again.< /text>< pics>

Although there are several U-haul dealers around, I discovered this location via the thousands of favorable on-line reviews. I’ve made several trips to this location and Sam, the owner, was always very friendly, honest and helpful.  He treats you like family and his shop is always well stocked.  I’d highly recommend Sam and his U-haul location to all.< /review>< Pics>

Probably the best U-haul that we've experienced and we've used A Lot of them over the years! Sam and Mary went above and beyond to make sure our move to Texas was flawless. So much so that Sam drove over 30 miles at 11pm the night before to pick up our truck to ensure we had it when they opened the morning of pickup. Mary threw in some freebies too. I definitely recommend this location!<//review>

< Review>
What an incredible experience renting a U-Haul trailer! From start to finish I was very impressed with the level of communication and service provided by Sam and his staff at this U-Haul location. Had called the shop two weeks before our move to get everything arranged - Sam was very friendly on the phone. He helped coordinate the proper size trailer for our move, and quoted a very reasonable rate. I had called over with a few questions prior to the move, and each time was greeted with a very warm reception and clear information. This is where it gets even better! Come pick-up day I meet Sam in person, and he greets me as if I was family. We get the trailer hooked up, and find that the turn signal fuse was blown on my truck. Sam said no worries, went into the office, found a 10 amp in his stash and helped me get on the road safely. Would absolutely recommend this U-Haul location.</Review>

We have rented U-Haul trucks and a trailer from Sam and he has always come through and gotten us the equipment when we were moving boxes and furniture from San Diego to Tucson  Don't ever order online from Uhaul.com, as we got burned twice from U-Haul when we ordered two months in advance and 20 hours before our pick-up time they called us and said they did NOT have a truck for us!! Definitely go to Sam as his U-Haul store will always get you what you need! Thanks Sam!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Just want to say thank you for all your help!!.
3 weeks ago we were in a trouble trying to find a correct  vehicle to move all my stuff from Poway to Oklahoma. That evening  it was late and you help us with all the process to find exactly what we needed and a even with a better price/discount and on top that, you and your son stayed late to help and be sure everything was going to be ok. We really appreciated, thanks a lot.
Merry Christmas  and Happy New year!!!< /Text>

He gave us a much bigger van with the same price that we reserved because we had made a mistake reserving the truck and he did not have one at the time. It was partially our mistake but he took the responsibility for it. Also the price is reasonable compared to home depot or other renting places. 100% recommended.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhNTNLz9KWAg2DQICl97pxE2sQJ05pM-kpdGIc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8Rjy0dHzk2Rqi4-jIpQgtf2GK7g_uOOB2CMyD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<user_name>Mike Arnold<//user_name><Date>1576878942885<//Date><Rate>4</Rate><review>I typically reserve via the U-Haul app or website, which really cuts down the time. Would be much better if it saved your DL and other rental information, but understand both sides to that debate. Also, most don’t rent often enough to need to save info, but for those that do, may want to consider options.

This particular pick-up location is awesome. The location owner and his wife are very friendly and help to get you in and out quickly.< /review>< pics>

Sam rushed me through the check in with no paperwork given and no walk through of vehicle. I took a picture of the mileage when I got into the vehicle for documentation since nothing was verified prior to that. Upon returning the vehicle I was rushed away once again with out recieving paperwork. I recieved an emailed receipt which the mileage out did not match what it was when I took possession of the vehicle resulting in being over charged by 7 miles at $0.89 per mile ($6.23). I email Sam the same day to have written documentation and days later still no response. I also accidentally left 2 ratchet straps in the back of the van which Sam would have saw when he opened the back to remove the dolly before I was even out of the vehicle and nothing was said to me nor did I recieve a phone call from him letting me know. Avoid this place if you don't want to get ripped off.</Review>

Nice little u-haul dealer. I was concerned with the tight parking situation but Sam seems to bring out all of the trucks on his own. I wouldn't recommend the U-Haul truck share service here but that's not a huge issue. Overall process was easy and smooth. You can tell Sam cares about taking care of his customers.<//text>

Really good service! Staff is super friendly and willing to work with your needs. Definitely call ahead if you are renting the smaller van, they only have one and the website shows it available even though it might not be. This happened to me but they gave me the next size up for the same price and I really appreciated that!! Will definitely come back when it's time to move again.< /Review>

<Review>By far the friendliest, most helpful, straightforward and honest staff I have encountered at a U-Haul facility. This is a family-run site, and it shows in their integrity and care for their customers. While waiting in line, I saw the wife patienhelping the guy in front of me figure out the best deal for his needs. The husband then kindly supported my [initial] decision to try for a better deal at Home Depot, explaining what parameters could make their rental more affordable for my situation. Well, Home Depot was out of trucks, so I circled back to be graciously rented a truck at this site.
Additionally, this was the cleanest U-Haul vehicle I have rented.
I would highly recommend this site to everyone!</Review>< Pictures>

Sam is the most amazing guy. It was our first time moving and we have never rented a big truck before. He guided me through the process and made it easy. I just returned the truck it was even easier to do so. Moving can be tough but when you have amazing service like this, it will be a whole lot easier. Thank you!< /text>

<Text>I was attempting to rent a car dolly from this location and when I called about 20min before the listed closing time, I was placed on hold and then left on hold. When I arrived at this location about 10min before closing (a little last minute, I know. I was also still on hold when I arrived) I found the doors to be locked, along with other confused customers standing outside. As far as I can tell, when I called and was placed on hold, whoever did so just left right after that. Very disappointing, considering the fact that it likely wouldn't have taken long to handle what I needed.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Great beer selection.  I rented a Uhaul here and had no problems.  I saw they sold beer and I still come back.  They have a huge domestic selection, but I usually come for the imports.  The prices are good. I'm happy.  They spoke English.</text>

Very friendly and fast service.  I'm used to it taking time to get my rental contract completed and out the door but once I completed my selection online, the pickup of the van was very quick.  It took no more than 5 minutes before I was driving off the lot.</Review>

We did a 24/7 trailer drop off here today, which is supposed to be fast and easy online, and the crazy owner, this Sammy fellow, tells us we can’t leave the trailer and that his lot is full. I’m staring at three empty spots right in front of his store. Seriously, right in front.  He tells us to back up the trailer and take it somewhere else. Back it down a narrow road we just drove up?He just keeps pointing and saying take it away. We say the whole point of easy drop off is to drop off at empty spots and complete return online. As he’s hollering we get Uhaul email confirm that our return has been processed so we say we’re leaving. Then his wife comes out
and starts in on how we can’t leave it and that there’s no room. The two of them should not be in the customer service business. They clearly are not properly trained to deal with these situations and were ansive and rude. We have reported his conduct to Uhaul.<//Text>

It was less than 1 star. The owner was crazy and super rude and impolite. I don't think I will use here again.
Ah, be careful when you call him you should call him with Dr. Sam not just Sam otherwise he will yell to you.<//text>

<text>The food was awesome and the service was great. I liked the atmosphere as well. I got 2 ponds of crawfish in the cajan sauce with garlic bread and a michelada. It was bomb. The favor was more towards the Mexican favor side more then the cajan. But it was still tasty.</text>< gmapID>

I had a “soda water” which is literally just water and a fish and chips. My bill should have been 11.99, but it was 17.99, when I asked the young lady for the receipt and looked at it, I explained that it is very unusual to charge someone 3 dollars for a water. She argued with me. Clearly these people are desperate for money..  they would have had a customer who came back and literally threw money at them, but they won’t be getting that from me.

I’m sorry but do not waste your money . I invited my friend to go with me since we both had never been there . I got garlic butter shrimp
And she got Cajun style shrimp .... they had no flavor !!!  The Cajun tasted like straight up tomato sauce and the garlic butter shrimp had no flavor .. they barely tasted like butter .. I was so disappointed to be honest . You guys are better off heading to the Bay Area like San Jose to get some or finding a recipe on utube and making it at home (:< /Text>

<review>I've been here twice and each time I spent over $30 on food for my fiancée and myself. Neither of us was satisfied after eating on either of our visits. Plus I spent $8 to add scallops to my takeout order and when I got home I discovered they only gave me three scallops. $8 for three scallops.

This place is a total rip-off. Their food is overpriced and underdelivers and if you are getting take out the staff will cheat you and give you three  measly scallops.

Not to mention the staff left our takeout order on the counter and never called out to us despite the fact we were standing right in front of them. We stood around for around ten minutes before asking if the food in front of us was ours. The cashier didn't know, he had to find somebody and ask them.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We had the shrimp in 911 sauce and my wife had the shrimp taco.  We also got a side of cilantro rice and garlic bread.  It was very good!!  Unfortunately we were the only ones here for outside dining :(  Come on people get out and support our local businesses!!!<//text>

Got there about 6 pm on a Saturday and it was busy, when I left at 7 pm people were starting to line up at the door.

There are 3 sauces, the regular, 911 and 5150. The 911 sauce is really good, hot enough for people who like spicy food without being too hot so you can't enjoy the food. I got crab, shrimp, corn and sausage. Yes the shrimp is whole shrimp so if you don't like that be aware.

They also have appetizers, we got the super carne asada fries and they are really good. My only real complaint is the crab they use doesn't have much meat in it and it's stringy. It's $17.99 per pound and I feel like I paid for crab shells. I'll go back again for sure, they have a really good menu but the crab just threw me off.</text></record>

My wife & I decided to stop in and have fish &chips...we figured shrimpys, fish & chips must be good ...well........it wasn't. It was by far the worse fish &  chips I have ever had in my life, the fish seemed under cooked and the fries were so soggy.  I have had fish & chips in many places but never here again. For $25.00 the food should have been way better!!!! If I could give 0 stars I would !</review>

<Review>We ordered to go. Paid $70, got 2 bags and some fried zucchini and bread. The corn was old tasting and the bread was very hard and stale. The Cajun seasoning needs salt and was practically flavorless, the 5150 was tasty but the crab legs were very small with little meat. The best part about the meal was the zucchini, and they forgot the ranch🤦‍♀️<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

They say Alaskan crab legs, but they're regular crab legs. Other than that i really enjoyed the place.
Got to relax and make a BIG mess "and that's what's it's all about" and enjoyed myself.
Service was good very polite and talkative.
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax and just be messy.</Text>

Great place. Family owned and the wife is absolutely amazing. Very personable and attentive. Food was absolutely delicious. We will definitely be returning and my mom is actually going tomorrow, we've been looking for a place like this. My sister attends the University and has plans to visit soon as well.

Unfortunately we were disappointed in shrimpys . during this crucial time, ordered the family meal. Got home and the corn, sausage, potatoes and crawfish were missing. Had to drive back to pick up. Service was amazing! But the quality of food was not. Crawfish lacked flavor and our snow crab was soft and just shredded when we cracked it. Maybe next time we’ll order tacos and possibly the asada fries? Wouldn’t recommend the seafood. Sorry<//text>

This hidden little eatery has some awesome food, worth the prices which are reasonable and the food is delicious. We will be visiting again soon, and I recommend trying the Shrimpy bag, that's our next order when we visit again. You can customize your bag with almost any item they have on the menu like potatoes, corn on the cob, crab. And your choice of sauce. Try it, I bet you'll like it as much as we will.</review>

<review>Such a waste of money. The seafood was not tasteful at all! That sauce was straight up spaghetti sauce and the sea food was not washed at all! I got the combo #1 the only good thing there was the snow crab</review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Not sure if it's just not my kind if thing, but they forgot to give us a set of utensils, the Cajun shrimp was a bit bland for my taste and I'm personally not a fan of restaurants that the idea is to get "your hands dirty" or where the appeal is to clean my own shrimp. I like plates and places to throw away my trash, and if I'm paying $11+/lb for shrimp I think things like corn and potatoes should come in the bag that's dropped in the middle of the table, that being said this place has some of the best Carne Asada fries I've had, but still not enough to raise that star. My experience was an overall bad one.<//text>

Ok so first of all I'm allergic to fish but the reason they get 5 stars is because litterly there azada fries there quesadillas there tacos are freaken amazing and they don't cross contaminate. Also my daughter enjoy there seafood so we can both sit down and eat. The place don't smell fishy at all so it's enjoyable. The owner and her husband are a delight very friendly and talkitive</Text>

Service is always very good, even when they are busy, they make sure you're taken care of! Portions are insane and prices are fair. Really good price for seafood. Recommend trying it atleast once! Ask for Vanessa, she has been our server both times and we haven't left disappointed.</review>

<Text>Went there for a Birthday. I personally have not seen food delivered in a bag but from what I heard this is very popular in the south. The place is small but it was packed and people.waited outside. Me personally it was good. I had a hamburger simply because i am very picky on sea food. Staff was very friendly.</Text>< pictures>

The food was below par,service was horrendous compared to the other patrons. The food lacked flavor and bounce. For that much money, I will tell everyone not to come here, spending  $95, I expected better all the way around and regret wasting my time and hard earned money here!!</Text>

You need more waiters!!!!!!!!!!! We ordered the combo #1 and we were missing the potatoes, sausage and corn. Please make sure that everything comes with the order. We asked for our are missing items and we never got them. Also it needs more Seasoning to your Cajun it’s to bland. The steak fries are great!
Good luck 😊</Text>

looks good but was sadly missing flavor and the heat. when i ordered the gal goes you sure you want the 51/50 its very spicy. i said yup. sadly the sausage was spicier as i told the server thinking maybe it was put in wrong. all she said was that everyone takes heat differently to which i replied my 3 yr old could eat this. and out of clam chowder that is the soup of the day on fridays. i know it was a long and short week so ill give them a try again. was so excited to try it and left very disappointed<//text>

<review>I went to shrimpys last sunday. And as i was eating i bit down and found a metal piece in shrimp. They gave me a $25 voucher and my meal was free but thats besides the fact that i was chewing and found a sharp metal piece. Now im having to go to the doctor to get checked to make sure! Seems that they have a huge hygiene problem already & just being open! So anyone that goes or tries to go be aware of your food!</review>< user>

< Review>
The only reason why cant give this place a 5 star is because i am so use to the delicious  flavor of The Boiling Crab and thats what i had in mind when when we came here. I mean shrimpys is not bad but it was missing something. I wish i could rate service separately they would get a 10! They are great. So friendly and always asking if everything is ok or if we needed refills. Place is clean and service was quick.</Review>

Can be messy as it all comes in a bag and you have to shell everything so you may want to consider that if you are on lunch break and have to go back to work. Two of us shared the #1 combo: Crawfish, shrimp, clams, potatoes, sausage, corn on the cob plus we added scallops.  This could've fed 3 people- it was a lot of food.  They have 3 different spice levels, we did the mildest one which was perfect for my girlfriend who does not like food too spicy- the medium (called the 9-1-1) would have been too spicy for her but it is good if you like some kick. The 51/50 is the hottest of the three and it was pretty extreme.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Christopher Aguirre< /Name><userid>115993832000438517197<//userid><Rating>4< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

<review>Restaurant is clean, service was good. I got the pound of shrimp with a side of potatoes and corn. Flavor was alright, the cajun sauce could have had a tiny bit more kick to it, the 911 sauce is hot, but mixed together it was good. I just dont like the whole shrimp with the head on and I like my shrimp de-veined. The prices were not too bad. 3 stars from me.< /review>< userid>

<Date>1525711388256< /Date><Review>I believe they just opened. Very expensive, for 6 people with tip was $170.00. And 5 of us had water to drink. The seasoning was ok. The freshness of the shrimp and crawfish were questionable to us. Most of the crawfish we had were so small the tails were barely 1 inch long. The service was good and the place was clean.</Review><user_name>Cindy Clinton< /user_name><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>If you're going for the Crack N Peal Shrimp that's served by the pound, I would say pass this place up.  I've eaten at several places that are similar to this, The Boiling Crab and the Firehouse Crawfish Cajun Seafood Restaurant both of which are located in Sacramento off Stockton Blvd.  Unfortunately my first visit to Shrimpy's will be my last.  I really enjoy Seafood and was looking forward to having a local place close by that serves up large quantities of great Seafood.  I hate to say it but this isn't the place... and the one in Modesto off of McHenry is equally 2 stars at best.
So far The Firehouse Crawfish Cajun Seafood Restaurant in Sacramento off the 65th expressway and Stockton Blvd is the true King of Crab and Shrimp, The Boiling Crab is a close second.  I really hate to give a bad review especially to a local business.  Unfortunately when you name the business "Shrimpy's" their highlight needs to be Shrimp!!! But that's not the case.  The servers were polite and very helpful, the atmosphere was family style, like sitting at a picnic table loaded with Seafood.  The food quality was just subpar.  To be fair, they did have other things on the menu and from what I saw parked on my neighbors tables it looked pretty good.  For myself, I have to say, take a drive to Sacramento and you'll see the difference between the two places immediately.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

We recently submitted an architectural application to replace our garage door and upon submitting, we were notified that a price increase for the door was expected in the near future. Jenna Dever assisted us with the application processing and once she was made aware of the expected price increase, she expedited the response to help us avoid additional costs. Thank you for all your help Jenna, you are awesome!< /review>

Our community jumped from the fire into the flames. I left 3 messages for the property manager and not a single call back. I got a bill for over $900, a past due notice. Actually I'm paid in advance but PCA is now telling me it can take 60 days for the credits to show up............I own 2 other properties and those property management companies are very responsive. Can you hear me?< /review>

<review>I enjoy working with Jenna because she is responsive and provides timely follow up. While the office has adjusted hours due to COVID, I’ve still been able to connect to get any requests addressed. The one frustrating thing may be the inoperable key fobs for the recreational area, but I think that may be more of a vendor issue. I would give Jenna five stars but since the review is for the HOA, I have to settle in a bit more to be able to rate higher.</review><date>1620357719243< /date><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

I recently moved to Spencer’s Crossing and both key fobs were not working. I was given Jenna Devers contact information, so I emailed her to let her know. Jenna emailed me back ASAP, and explained that a technician would be out this week and my key fobs should be working by the end of the week. Jenna reached out to me again today to give me an update that a technician had come out and my keys should be working. She also explained that if in fact they weren’t, to let her know ASAP. I appreciate her fast response and update. Can’t wait to take my kiddos to all the amenities Spencer’s Crossing offers. Thank you Jenna!</Text>

<Text>Having never been involved with an HOA, we were a little concerned about the process.  As we dive into our backyard project we have been pleasantly surprised at the flow of the process.  Jenna Dever, our Community Manager has not only been very responsive but has also been very helpful in making sure we understand every step of way.  All the while making sure we do not miss any required information so that our submittal review and approval is not delayed.  Thanks you Jenna for all your help.

<Text>We have owned several homes in our community over the last 34 years and were new to having an HOA for our most recent home. We recently went through the process to make some changes to our home and needed to apply for those changes with our HOA. We had some questions and spoke to Jenna Dever about the process. We didn't know what to expect, but our expectations were not only met, but exceeded! Jenna was helpful, prompt, kind and professional. Her communication was excellent and we felt reassured at every turn. It completely changed our feelings about having an HOA (to be honest, we were a little intimidated at first) and couldn't be happier with our experience with Jenna. Thank you, Jenna, for being amazing to work with!<//Text><time>1622163550682<//time>< username>

<Text>I can’t express how happy I am with my recent experience requesting architectural review and approval through Sundance Community Association!

Jennifer Dever made fast work of my request working closely with the community architect. Not only was she super responsive, she was extremely professional and demonstrated a desire to help me make my tight schedule!

I can’t say enough how effective and efficient Jennifer Dever and the Sundance Community Association of the Associa Company truly is!

In short, thank you to all the helped and I look forward to any future interactions.

I sold my condo run by Associa in December 2020.  They charged me for January’s HOA fees, and told me I’d be refunded.  It’s not April and I have followed up multiple times, once in mid March and once again in early April.  They said they’d submit a ticket in March and ensure they would get me my refund, however I’ve heard that same line from them before.

I’ve spoken to one person over the phone in January and she was extremely rude and told me she’d hang up on me.

I would never recommend buying a home with Associa as the HOA management or whatever it is.  If I could give them 0 stars I would.

Associa, I am STILL waiting on a reimbursement check.  When will I be able to get it? Apparently contacting you via email isn’t an appropriate way to get ahold of anyone, maybe leaving a review is since you guys ask for them.< /text>

Kara goes far beyond her duty to make sure that every question is answered and every detail has been attended to. She leaves no stone unturned and the Colony is blessed to have her.  She always puts a smile on everyones face and is the most dedicated and hard working person that I have ever met.</text>

I’m writing to say thanks for all that Kara Hardy does to keep us entertained.  I enjoy the game nights.  I thought Sarah Wilson’s classes were interesting, (Time-hop is fascinating to me) and each contest that she has planned has been quite fun.

Kara is really working hard during this very unique time of COVID,.  She goes above and beyond to provide interesting events for your pleasure and participation.   I appreciate all she does.< /Text>

<review>Ellen Racobs is a community manager for Edenglen Community Association. My wife and I have been calling and E-mailing her and her assistant about a annoying beeping noise coming from the electrical shed behind our garage for 2 MONTHS, the problem gets resolved for maybe half or 3/4 of a day and then religiously starts back up, we pay $ 300 dollars in HOA fees and can’t believe she or anybody from this ENORMOUS COMPANY can’t fix this problem,  WOW WELL DONE.!!!!!!!!!!</review><Rating>1</Rating>< pics>

<text>Quinoa lentil empanada was my favorite! Very good. The chimichuri however is not good. It's made with dry herbs instead of fresh so it tastes very different. Also the photos showed outdoor dining in the front but we had to go sit in the back. Once seated, we realized they didn't give us a fork for the salad. The only way to get one is to walk all the way around the block to the front. One of the waitresses came to the back so we asked her but she said since she was on break, she wouldn't be able to help us.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<review>Empanadas taste was alright 5 out of 10 in my honest opinion. They are pricy much better empanadas at Porto’s bakery and cheaper. The service was excellent. I definitely will not be back.< /review>< Pics>

Amazing empanadas. Got some sauces but didn't even use them. My favorites & it's really hard to pick, would probably be the biscuits and gravy. The rosemary taste was delicious.< /Review>

Delicious, hot, and fresh. The ones with cheese had quite a lot of cheese if you love the ooey gooey, personally a bit much for me. The empanadas were flaky and warm and they do mark them with initials so you know which on is which. I wanted to try them all but my stomach is only so big.</text>

I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Just picked up a couple dozen. Some fresh out the oven for now and some take and bake for later. Meat and vegan options, sweet and savory! Vegan mushroom and mixed berry are my faves.< /review>

I am always so excited when I go that I order more than I can eat - the menu is just that good, and their food delivers.

They've also helped me when I wanted to place orders ahead of time for me to heat in my oven at home. I would highly recommend World Empenadas for pay food!

Their current location is fantastic (a big step up from their humble beginnings inside a liquor store), and they are doing a great job offering COVID-safe measures.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Great, quick place for lunch! Friendly service, delicious empanadas and soup. Very reasonably priced combo. Would've given 5 stars if they had more seating and a restroom! (Only room for 12 inside, 4 outside) Would be perfect place to grab food for a picnic or party.< /review>

On my first ever visit I attempted to place an order at their order window which is OUTSIDE and meanwhile keeping a safe distance. The middle aged man working the window points at his face to refer to a face mask. I was not wearing one so I told him: "we're outside". He replies "yeah but you know". Not even a "hello", or a "welcome". First order of business is we are all human beings, so let's act like it. People are allowing local politicians to control how they live and treat eachother.

<Review>Every empanada is made fresh, so of course it takes time for the food to come out, but it's worth the wait. They have a good variety of flavors too. Will definitely be back!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Let’s start from the beginning. My wife and I have passed by this place many times and I truly regret not stopping by sooner. I loved my biscuits and gravy empanada as well as the Chili con Carne empanada. My wife had the beef and chicken. Everything had such great flavors. Last, but certainly not least, the Dulce de Leche and the Nutella and banana. I am torn as to which one I liked best but we most definitely will be back again, thanks for the hospitality. #nohofoodie #nohofattie #chefrobertfoodfinds #foodiefoodporn #foodporn #empanadalife #empanadasarelife #818 #Burbank #keepMagnoliaforsmallbusiness #shoplocal #shoplocal818 #818foodfinds</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLx1PSCtje1j_V1awezaaAB4_uf_7ORFUs-C8G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF29JNCdfdWT5EFSx426pnNEX-XeJiXqJlsftD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2P96R9WUc0-cdlhWFpKNoEc_H9eOmNvGL7zIs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIfXiCJgEdEabtILvRLH11zmsOeglhsaW5ftZS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzZAHH-YzxWHqfOK_StmUvJ7tvFD9aa81SS7eN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeYI2cQ2NJYUwTxGx_5qJd3Y78fQrz9FPt6pPo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjuFJRWChNbMqIF1sN9gq8Bkmaq4veOuJ1KuxE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVQX6sFNq1fo0qcRfStpChtN14LmRqT5Fb1NZ6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhk2-tVI105Pyo7svHy4RaLAkQSeSobEnaopO4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6j2NgAitjKZ0IUg57qXUOP_zYDlZhRZAqi1qg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrdBKMaT1oSZkJJIRU0lKo_zGlpoo0oNK66CC6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDAfmAkWAOh94W8ffPAreDQE9kzAS2eJzEFT3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqZju5wRpRW4sh-c0TDzXaILXvDEBT7f7_5-CB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHir5aG-_05RQMKSAfnSWJILLCaSJVUVd2zDp-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Ordered the Impossible Empanada (vegan) and washed it down with a refreshing Horchata (also vegan). I'm not a vegan, I just enjoy eating good food and this place came highly recommend. Also sampled tastes of the Mixed Berry, Spinach & Cheese, Cheese & Potato and Quinoa & Lentil. Come here with friends so you can all try different ones. Chef and staff were so welcoming. Restaurant is small but elegant, stylish and well serviced. Oh yeah .. don't forget to get little cups of chimmichurri (casero/homemade) or salsa verde or roja! This place makes me wish I had a faster metabolism so I could eat here everyday!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>They need a lesson in courtesy and customer service. On my first ever visit I attempted to place an order at their order window which is OUTSIDE and meanwhile keeping a safe distance. The middle aged man working the window points at his face to refer to a face mask. I was not wearing one so I told him: "we're outside". He replies "yeah but you know". Not even a "hello", or a "welcome". First order of business is we are all human beings, so let's act like it. People are allowing local politicians to control how they live and treat eachother. What a joke. Wishing them all the best because they may need it with service like that.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Normal when a new wave looking shop opens I'm not that impressed.  But I have to say the quality and taste of the empanadas and burritos was amazing.  I get worried when I see vegan items featured (reminds me of some hipster joint).  But this place hit every note on my pallet.  Price was fair.  Quality was perfect and shop vibe fit what there are serving.  Customer service was great.  I guess the only constructive criticism I can offer is to change the chimichurri sauce.  Use fresh spices instead of dried.  I will definitely be back to spend more of my money here.  😋😋😋<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz6Wjke6IfNpKl0kT2RZ4FVfWPbOnnDBfU5EKg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>{'time': 1569103575086, 'text': 'Thank you for spending your hard earned money with us Steven:] You rock'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I like they have 5 vegan options (4 salry and 1 sweet) the dough is the best part and the fillings are ok. I ordered one of each vegan options:
-Lentils and quinoa; highly suggested 💯
-Soy chorizo with potatoes; yummy 🤤
-Mushrooms & cashew cheese; yummy 🤤
-Beans & rice; so so.
My husband ordered a combo; 2 empanadas, salad and soda. He said beef was ok and the chicken was very bland.
The highlight is the flaky, crispy, dough.
Their green sauce is very good as well as the chimichurri. The tomatoe sauce is ok.</Review>

<review>Ordered the Impossible Empanada (vegan) and washed it down with a refreshing Horchata (also vegan). I'm not a vegan, I just enjoy eating good food and this place came highly recommend. Also sampled tastes of the Mixed Berry, Spinach & Cheese, Cheese & Potato and Quinoa & Lentil. Come here with friends so you can all try different ones. Chef and staff were so welcoming. Restaurant is small but elegant, stylish and well serviced. Oh yeah .. don't forget to get little cups of chimmichurri (casero/homemade) or salsa verde or roja! This place makes me wish I had a faster metabolism so I could eat here everyday!< /review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Another one of my accidental fines. I love a good empanadas everyone can't make empanadas but this shop has perfected the empanadas.
The dough is tasty the feelings are even it's an even balance like yin and yang. An empanada is a personalized with their initials I found that to be very special. Nice people behind the counter.</text>

I never write reviews but I just eat a pumpkin empanada from here and my mind was blown. Let me tell you about it. It was Halloween 2016, my wife And I had just had a baby 3 weeks ago and have been trapped in the house due to this little love bug. We where in the market for a baby Bjorn and found a used one off Craigslist in the magnolia park area. So we packed up the baby and dog and drove the vehicle over that way. The sun was setting a beautiful reddish orange and we didn't have trouble finding the person's house. The house was cute, looked like a 3 bedroom. The family where all outside enjoying the cool Halloween night. The Baby Bjorn was just as advertised so we got it and where like what do we do next? I said I was hungry and looked around on Google maps for a quick bite. Our new baby was half asleep in the back seat so I knew we had some time to find a place. That's when I found World Empanadas! It was less then a mile away so we strolled on over baby and dog in tow and that's when we tried the aforementioned pumpkin empanada. You should DEFINITELY try it... but I'm remembering now that it was a special that day so they probably won't have it when you go. Try something else it's all good!</text>

Amazing variety of delicious empanadas. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options, as well as lots of meaty ones. Owners are Argentine and Mexican, so everything is authentic. Lovely find with a great atmosphere.< /review>

<Text>I have ate here a few times and meant to write a review sooner. If I could give this place 100 stars I would. There’s so many great things to say about this place. This is a family owned establishment, Carlos and his family are amazing. They are very helpful and friendly. I love to support a mom and pop place that cooks with love and from their heart. The food is amazing. It is fresh and homemade. It is not fried greasy food, The empanadas are baked, healthy and so delicious. They also care about your experience. You do not find many places like this especially here in LA. I am a vegan and they have many vegan options. They run vegan specials and they are expanding their vegan menu every day. I was very excited they’re opening another location. I hope they go worldwide, keep fresh homemade foods and loving caring amazing service. 🌱👍🏻💪🏻🥰💯🙏🏻<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1573503996601, 'text': 'Thank you so much for eating with us:]'}</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Awesome little Burbank restaurant to get empanadas at. They have various kinds to choose from including meat, vegetarian, and vegan options. At about $3.50 a piece, you can easily get filled up for about $10. Service is fast but be prepared for a small wait at extremely busy times. They also serve breakfast burritos until noon.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Normal when a new wave looking shop opens I'm not that impressed.  But I have to say the quality and taste of the empanadas and burritos was amazing.  I get worried when I see vegan items featured (reminds me of some hipster joint).  But this place hit every note on my pallet.  Price was fair.  Quality was perfect and shop vibe fit what there are serving.  Customer service was great.  I guess the only constructive criticism I can offer is to change the chimichurri sauce.  Use fresh spices instead of dried.  I will definitely be back to spend more of my money here.  😋😋😋<//Review>

A little quaint place that offers quality and clean food that's not greasy .

Pros:  Empanadas are delicious.   They are baked not fried.  Variety of flavors and stuffings are offered.   They also serve soups and salads.

Cons:  I have ordered coffee from them 3 times.  Every single time,  they were lukewarm and NEVER HOT.  I told them about my coffee not being hot.  They reheated my coffee in the microwave!  Each time instead of brewing a fresh batch!  Unreal! I wish I were joking, my wife was with me.  That alone drops a star for me.   I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM 3 STARS just for that.

I also wish for the friendlier staff.  Normally the ones at the register taking order are the friendliest ones.  But the ones serving the food not so much.  When I pay $3.40 for each empanada,  I expect a great service.

Just today alone, my bill was over $100.00.  I am sure the mgmt is listening.< /Text>

<text>Whoa!!!! These are the best empanadas in Burbank! They make them fresh all day long and I have to say you have to try all the flavors all of them! Each empanada has something incredible about it.

Their soups are on point, and their espresso is great and I’m just thankful my office is within walking distance of this place to come to as often as possible.

Vegan, vegetarian, and many other options available for empanadas!

If you haven’t tried this place out yet, go online place and order or stop by in Burbank you’ll be glad you did. Plenty of seats to enjoy your wonderful empanadas!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I've place an order for a dozen empanadas online, I chose the fillings for each empanada.
When I got home with my box of empanadas I realized that many of the fillings had been substituted without even giving me a call or  telling me when I picked it up!! I think this is disrespectful specially because some substituted empanadas where change from vegan to meat. This was unprofessional and unnecessary.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Chimichurri sauce is a very tasty non-spicy option, I'm into spice so the green spicy sauce is my favorite.

Staff is always helpful and friendly. My husband and I recently catered a small event at our house from here - everyone loved it! When you order through catering you get these small tubs of the sauces that lasted us for like a week or so after the event.

Okay - not totally sure they deserve 5 stars but it was good for what it was. The service was certainly fine. You have to remember this is closer to a fast food place than a 5 star so, service was okay. The food was okay - again - for it being this type of place. The problem I had is that most of my hispanic friends would have never made Empanadas like this. Everything appeared baked and our meal was served not hot so the whole Mexican Empanadas thing kinda got lost. If you like Empanadas and you are expecting authentic then this is not your place. On the other hand if you want decent food at a decent price then this just might be for you.<//Review>

Having never been here before, I didn't know what to expect! I was delighted to see some vegetarian options including mushroom & cashew cheese (which my daughter loved), the spinach & cheese (OMG so amazing), we also tried the ham & cheese (equally delicious) and of course the dessert one, mixed berry. Yum! Thank you for an amazing quick lunch!< /review>

Their prices are fair, their empanadas, chimichurri, and drinks are delicious, and the folks are nice. Parking is a little less intuitive than other spots in Burbank. The location is small-ish, bit accomodating. There is seating outside if you have a dog.< /Text>

<Review>One of my favorite places in Burbank.
Family owned business. The owner started from something small and now he is at this nice store. I commend him.

I usually get the combo 2 empanadas with the soup.
I’ve tried many of the empanadas.
The ones standing out.
Santa fe chicken, carne, spinach and cheese, ham and cheese...
Some desert empanadas as well.

Ask for the Horchata with coffee. Great mix of flavors.

They deliver for catering.</Review>< time>

I tried a couple of different empanadas and the only one I liked was the biscuits and gravy empanada and even that one was just okay. The prices aren't bad, If they just changed up some stuff in the empanadas it could be better. The rest of the empanadas were a bit dry I think I didn't really enjoy them.</Text>

<Review>Stumbled upon this small homey empanada spot while walking around Burbank. They have a wide variety of fillings including vegan/vegetarian options.

My favorites:
-Chile con Carne (Top favorite)
-Santa Fe Chicken
-Nutella & Banana (Favorite dessert option)

Order at the counter, eat it right there at their patio or indoor seating, or eat as you walk around Burbank. Perfect snack or lunch!<//Review><rating>5</rating>< Response>

<Time>1573790846929< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I have driven by Magnolia Avenue in Burbank many times, but never seemed to have notice this nice little store that sells probably the best empanadas in LA. They have about 18 selections, which ranges from meat fillings to dessert fillings. I was able to try 3 of them, including the chile con carne, Sante Fe Chicken, and banana nutella. I liked them all. The chile con carne and sante fe chicken had a nice taste to it, and kind of spicy as well. The crust texture is pretty awesome. I was also surprised at how well empanadas tasted as desserts, especially with the delicious nutella filling. What's cool is that you can eat the empanadas in store, and take out as well.

I would recommend this place. The selections are nice, the taste is great, and the prices are reasonable. It's the only store of its kind in Burbank, which alone makes this a local business to support in the area. I have a video of my food adventures here on my YouTube channel called Rockstar Eater if you are interested in seeing it.<//Text>< pictures>

Bathroom would have been nice but it is a smaller place.  The food was some of the best I have had and I can't believe I never tried a desert empanada before.  I suggest a collection and take some for later they are very convenient!<//Review>

<text>Savor the empanadas of the world. Pretty decent food here but a little costly. People still come to their empanadas fix though some there's always a good amount of people inside waiting for their food. You can order ones that are already made or you can order fresh ones. Different fillings that are savory and delicious.

They also sell other stuff like drinks and even fresh made pasta.</text><pics>None< /pics><GmapID>0x80c2955e0eb97f8d:0xb7695fa8874a59b7< /GmapID>< Response>

<Text>Absolutely delicious and with so many diverse options to choose from.  The mixed berry in particular was like a wonderful handheld pie, which if you know Tastykake pies from the East coast is a wonderful thing to realize you can find in this form. You also have to love the variety of chimichurri seasonings to use with the more traditional empanadas</Text>< pics>

Love, love this place. Drove all the way from Bakersfield just to try it. I will definitely be back. Next year I will be buying two dozen for Christmas breakfast. Well worth the visit.</Review>

< Review>
Many delicious empanadas to choose from, including a vegan menu section of 4-5 different flavors. My favorite was the mushroom & cashew cheese followed by the soyrizo, though I would get any of them again. There was a special at the time of my visit, Impossible chili made with the Impossible crumble - not worth it for almost double the price of a regular empanada. The meal option is good for a lunch or dinner, though get 3-4 if you're really hungry!<//Review>

Really great empanadas, with vegetarian and vegan selections along with several tasty meats. My favourites were the Santa Fe chicken, lentil (it had curry seasoning),  and spinach/cheese. My fiance was a fan of the chili con carne.  For dessert - Nutella and banana! Will be going back again soon!< /text>

Great Empanadas.... when you get the right order.

We order from here every once in awhile for the last few months and they have NEVER got our order correct. Not once. They seem to purposely short the order if you order too many. Buyer beware.

Went back to grab some food and help out a local business, however, the employee was so rude, I'll never go back. This place deserves to go out of business. STAY FAR AWAY.</Review>

The horchata was the only thing that was good there. It was very flavorful. I tried the dulce de leche, the spicy potato and meat, the ham and cheese, the pineapple pork, the spicy meat empanadas and they were not impressing.</Review>

<Review>The empanada selection was good and the flavors were spot on. Community seating with limited outdoor seating, so get comfortable with a friendly neighbor.  Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the tall, sad-faced cashier that nearly refused to speak while taking our order. When asked a question, she just stared at me. Very awkward and it didn't have to be.<//Review>< Pics>

Place is kinda small but that's okay I got it to go anyway. The customer service was great I'm so glad the front register guy saw it on our faces so very grateful for that. They have a combo deal and its two empanadas, a soup (which is vegan) and a drink it will definitely hit the spot with the flavors and keep you full.

<Text>I’ve been searching for my dog, and a lead led me here... I originally came to just sus it out. Didn’t mean to actually try anything as I recently went raw-ish/ vegan (besides Greek yogurt). Going in, I realized it would be weird if I didn’t order anything. So I ordered a random side dish—still just sussing out the place in clues for my dog. The man (who turned out to be the owner) asked me if I had tried the empanadas—I said I hadn’t, and he gave me a ”how dare you” face (jokingly) and I explained I was vegan. He said “we have vegan empanadas!” — oh, well in that case... give me the mushroom/ nut cheese one, to go. I dish out some salsa and the traditional empanada sauce (idk what it’s called). The order comes up. I go to my car, a little disheartened to not find any clues about my doggo, but to keep up my energy, I start to eat.... and holy wow! Maybe it’s because I hadn’t eaten anything hot in 4 weeks but this empanada was heaven in my mouth. The salsa was balanced, and the traditional dip that I can’t remember the name of was perfect. I feel like other places “water” it down with extra oil—not them. Perfect balance of oil and seasoning. It’s been another two weeks, and I’m still looking for my dog, but I went back again for two of these mushroom/nut cheese empanadas. The crust is golden and perfectly flakey. They were large, and perfectly balanced on the inside... And the two cost me $7 and some change. I’m always looking for the silver lining in any bad situation... and in the case of my missing/stolen dog, finding this place is one of them.<//Text>< date>

Can easily get expensive but it's worth it (plus they have a rewards program). Great variety of delicious empanadas and more! Cute shop. Decent location. Usually parking out front.<//Review>

<text>A truly hidden gem in Burbank, I've driven past this place so many times and never noticed it. A friend asked me to meet her here for breakfast and now I'm hooked! They have a great variety of empanadas from sweet to savory and all are baked fresh each day. The spinach and cheese is a must and if you're looking for something decadent try the banana and Nutella....oh so good and gooey.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Walked in and didn't even get acknowledged. Cashier was on the phone and didn't greet me and some dude was sitting on a stool who definitely looked like the owner and was fiddling with his smart phone like the narcissistic he seems to be. Walked in to get empanadas and walked out and didn't get a single eye contact, f this place. I ended up going across the street to Norms much better service there that's for sure.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Really can't say enough good things about this place.  The food is amazing and the service is right up there too.  And while you'll hear a lot about the empanadas, don't miss out on their breakfast burrito.  Seriously the best one I've had in years.  Not only made fresh, they put it on the grilltop to crisp up the tortilla once it's full.

Really, Go.</text>

My favorite thing is their vegan options! Awesome place to bring veggie friends. No compromise on quality.
Oh, and I could have about a gallon of their sauces. So yummy! Personally I recommend the green salsa and chimichurri.
Try some of everything, see what you like. This place is delish.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

World Empanadas is amazing, which I think is pretty common knowledge, but I love that you can order empanadas to take and bake. (!!!) I now have an (admittedly more expensive) exciting variant to my emergency freezer waffles and frozen cookie dough.<//text>

Great empanadas... A good selection with multiple vegetarian and vegan options.

This is one of the best empanada eateries I have visited.  Definitely worth a visit when in Burbank. The dessert emanadas are very good.< /review>

Modern empanadas! To be honest, I was a bit skeptical when the wife said she wanted to try this place out. But they won me over with their modern take on empanadas.  That biscuits and gravy empanada is delicious. We had our lunch combos and took a dozen to go. Will definitely pick up more next time I am in the area.< /review>

I was at the Cookie Con this weekend and the Owner, Super Nice Lady, gave me a sample of a Santa Fe Chicken empanada. It was sooo yummy.  I can't wait to visit the store to try some of the other flavors.  They have so many yummy flavors to choose from!<//Text>

This place is a hidden wonderland of empanadas. Our group of 5 ordered thirteen empanadas and two sides of chimi pasta... And had leftovers!  The empanadas are big enough to cut up and share--order a variety and enjoy all the different flavors they thoughtfully create.< /Review>

The Service: Order at the counter. They do have indoor/outdoor seating. It is very nice to meet with one of the owners, Chris. He personally took my order. When I told him it is my first time here, he took time to explain about their store, the concept and most important he gave me great recommendation of what to try. Excellent customer service!!

They also do local delivery & catering. You can even call & order ahead. Save time!!

The Food: I ordered 4 different kind of empanadas....

Santa Fe Chicken - Chicke breast simmered with black beans, corn, bell peppers, onions and tomatoes with spicy cayenne seasoning.

Potato & Cheese - Freshly diced potato sauteed with herbs and spices, simmered in a green jalapeno sauce with mozzarella cheese. Because of the green jalapeno sauce, just a little bit of heat. I like it~

Mixed Berries - Strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries with brown sugar (vegan). I love my dessert a little bit sour. I definitely don't feel guilty when I eat this dessert... super refreshing!

Nutella & Banana - Well.... I don't think I need to put description for this yummy dessert, right? Everything with Nutella tastes GOOOOD!!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE the different dipping sauces that they offer. You can definitely eat it without the sauce because the filling inside the empanadas are very flavorful already.

The Parking: Small private lot next to the store and street parking (free).<//text>

Great tasting empanadas. Had the beans and rice off the Vegan menu. And loved the flavor. Would recommend you get the combo will come with a drink and a dessert empanada. Dessert empanadas are great tasting too. Go in and meet the two generations of chefs that are showing life to a thriving community.  And please support local restaurants. Overall, very pleased with the food and owners. Very hospitable.< /Text>

<Text>It's a great and fun empanada's restaurant serving traditional empanada's to American fusion of biscuits and gravy to breakfast eggs and bacon empanada's. It's not cheap because a dozen empanada's go for about $36.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Been meaning to check this place out since I've been seeing their vinyl wrapped car in the area. I ended up going here for lunch and it wasn't packed much. Just 3 people inside and another 3 people in line. Not every empanada style was available on the go, but most were. I ended up trying the Sante Fe which was absolutely delicious! And one Spicy Potato and Cheese which was good but too spicy for my liking. Could've also used more cheese. The workers seemed friendly and I didn't experience any problems on the visit. Also helped myself to some of their homemade sauces and those were all great. Would definitely be back to try out some other empanadas.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The ham and cheese had good flavor and the dough was cooked just right but I noticed on my 1st visit that the guy helping me didn't look very clean and made me 2nd guess my choice but it was ok, no food poisoning and I went back for some yesterday.

When I walked in the counter was covered in crumbs, a different guy was behind the counter and wasn't very friendly. My other half was irritated by his lack of a greeting and the dirty counter and we walked through the liquor store and out the door.

Impressions are everything when you walk in to buy food. Note to restaurant, put a smile on and clean your counter tops.</text>< Pics>

The empanadas were lovely, I really liked the creamy corn one.  Also, having empanadas sparked an interesting conversation with me and my friends about what the equivalent of an empanada is for various cuisines.  For polish people, it's the perogi.  For Italians, it's the calzone.  For Americans, it's the hot pocket.  Interesting stuff.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>The empanadas are great tasty treats for a lunch, dinner, or even a snack. I had the chicken, Con Carne, and the biscuits and gravy. All of them were really good. The dough they use cooks great and is flaky like it should be and none of them were under cooked. If it's your first time eating empanadas let them cool off a little when they are fresh out of the oven because the contents on the inside will be hot. They have a huge selection of empanadas and even vegetarian options!</Text>< user>

The empanadas are delicious, the chimichurri sauce was excellent.... but I don't think they went together too well. Instead of using the sauce as a dip I used the sauce to cook with the next day (they gave us a decent amount of it). They have many vegan and vegetarian options, but the potatoes and cheese was SUPER spicy! I still loved it, but it would have been nice to have a warning. I will definitely be back for the empanadas and chimichurri sauce.</Text>
