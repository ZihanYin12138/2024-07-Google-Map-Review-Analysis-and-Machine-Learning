When I moved to Encinitas I went to 4 different groomers trying to find one as good & accommodating as the one I went to for years in San Diego. So disappointed....  I was about ready to make the drive to SD every time my dog  needed to be groomed. Then a friend mentioned Dog n Suds. Denise & Darcelle & their team of groomers are dog lovers who just seem to work their magic every time with my Schnauzer, Beau. Thank you! Aleana & Beau<//Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>After taking my 8 month old ShihTzu to two other highly recommended grooming businesses that I was not satisfied with and felt were overpriced, I looked over the recommendations on Nextdoor and tried Dogs In Suds. I was immediately pleased with their prices & the fact that they offered a la carte services instead of me always having to pay for a full service when a full service wasn’t always needed. I also appreciated them listening to me explain about my dog’s anxiety and history as a mill puppy and that I had just re-homed him about 5 months prior from the elderly couple who bought him from a pet store. They genuinely seemed to care that he had been through a lot of homes and he was still a puppy.

The first cut wasn’t exactly as I would have liked, but that was my responsibility for not communicating better what it was that I wanted. The second cut was fantastic. Exactly as I explained. Every cut since then has been awesome. Each time we arrive at Dogs In Suds my dog is pulling on the leash excited to head back to the grooming area. This never happened at the other groomers. We are both very pleased with Dogs In Suds. I always enjoy visiting with the other customers outside or on our way in or out. The owners, employees and customers are all very pleasant there.<//Review></record>

We're super helpful and friendly. Everything went really smoothly, my doggie was not stressed out and they got her nails super short. 😁 Plan to go when her nails get longish again for sure!!<//review>

Dog in Suds has been the only groomer we’ve used for our Labradoodle. They have been awesome, especially Cindy! We wouldn’t go anywhere else. The haircuts have been exactly what we wanted and our dog is always happy to go in for a grooming. I highly recommend Dog In Suds. Make sure to ask for Cindy!</Review>

<review>Recently moved to the area and needed a new groomer for my dog. Although there are a good amount of 1 star ratings I thought I would give them a try since their overall was a 4.0 rating and to be honest there are not a lot of small business groomers in the area. The people were very friendly and the groomer asked and listened to what kind of cut I wanted. When I picked up my dog she had one of the worst haircuts I've ever seen her get (and there was only one other time I felt this way about a cut my dog got). I’m not picky at all and usually don’t mind a little bit of choppiness cause it just grows back..Her body looked uneven which was pretty bad, but I could see past, but her face was SO CHOPPY. I had to use my husband's clippers to try my best to fix it. It was that bad that I felt the need to fix it immediately when we got home. Her cut was nothing like her head shape too! She looked like a different dog. They cut it short down the center of her face then longer around the sides like she had a middle part. Her ears weren't even trimmed..I'm not sure if I got someone new. I love supporting small grooming businesses and the people were very friendly, but for the price (which was a bit higher where I usually go to) I don't plan to ever go back. I really contemplated calling to bring my dog back to have them try to fix it, but decided I didn't want to risk her coming back worse. I want to add that my dog gets tons of cuts (every 3 months) so I know she is good when she gets groomed so I'm not sure how she messed up so badly :/ she is a Pomeranian poodle mix, but her hair is like a Pomeranian. Lastly, I dropped my dog off at 12 noon and they told me she would be done at 4pm which is long for a cut. Places like petco take 4 hours and I know they leave dogs in crates, which is why I only go to smaller grooming businesses that usually only take 2-2.5hours so I was already hesitant. After 4 hours I don’t receive any call that she's done and the store was closing in an hour. I finally call and the woman on the phone immediately says “oh, she's done”..I don't know how long my dog was just waiting there because I never received a call and I don't know how much longer she would've been waiting if I never reached out and called myself... also, usually the groomer will hand you your dog at the end and personally thank you, but she didn't. Someone else brought my dog out..I usually never write reviews unless a place is outstanding because great businesses deserve great reviews or unless my experience is horrible enough for me to want to warn future customers. A one star rating is brutal, but it is a reflection of the experience I had :/ seems like others can say the same ...</review>< Pics>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I took my dog here for the first time and when I picked him up he wanted to get out of there. I took him home and that night he didn't seem himself. The next day when I put his collar on he yelped. I felt his neck but he wouldn't let me touch it. That night I was massaging his back and he yelped again and was not himself. I thought he must have gotten hurt at the groomers. I called and left a message with the receptionist but nobody called me back. Then today I took his collar off again and he yelped so I took a deeper look and found punctures wounds on his neck and his back. So apparently he was attacked at the groomer. I thought it was odd that the gal that groomed him saw me st the dog park the day after and never said anything and she knows me and my dog. Now it all fits. Needless to say, I will not be going back there.<//text>< Pics>

He was beaming and knew he looked so cute. It took years off of him and he was much more comfortable.  It has grown back and I am so excited to take him in this Friday.

The best pomeranian hair cut around!  Dog in Suds groomers are the best.  I've been taking my dog to them every other month for 13 years and for 3 years before that with a different dog. Darcy is always loving to Teddy Bear. Now Teddy always gets stopped when we are on walks and told how adorable he is.  They do a perfect "puppy cut" . Thanks Dogs in Suds for being great to my fur babies.< /text>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS HERE!!!

I dropped my dog off at 12(noon) and was told to pick him up at 4pm. They usually take about 3 hours to groom my dog.
They called 1 1/2 hours after I dropped him off to let me know he was done, and that his right eye was swollen. I was shocked to hear this because he was fine before I dropped him off. The whole morning he had been playing and seemed very happy.
When my husband went to pick him up, he was told they called me before they started, to let me know they noticed something wrong, but I never got a call from them. Both my phone log and theirs confirmed only one call was made AFTER the grooming was complete. My husband rushed him to the vet. He was shaking and very frightened. That night he was very lethargic, obviously in pain. Now, days later, is eye is still swollen,  and not fully back to normal.

Now the owner refuses to pay for the vet bill!
DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS HERE!!!

We took our Pomeranian here and showed very specific photos of how we would like her hair cut. We are very disappointed with the outcome, they shaved off almost all of her hair and it’s very uneven. I won’t be taking her back here for another haircut.< /text>

<Text>BEWARE!! Overbooked, rushed, late and smells like must... but most importantly they will BUTCHER your dog's doo. They have horrible customer service that trickles down from the owner, Renee, who not only offered no apology for taking my Newfoundland's silky 6 inch coat down to a half inch buzz cut...she actually blamed me. I was clear and specific in my request for a 2 inch off the length cut and ended up with a buzz cut that was a disaster. All I see is chopped lines from the clippers. They couldn't even do a smooth buzz cut!  My dog's nose also came home bleeding like crazy from the crate. I wish that I could post pictures to this sight to convince you to go elsewhere. I understand that mistakes happen, but when the owner goes on the offense and denies any responsibility nor offers any apology...that  definitely questions business ethics. I also just realized that they don't ask for any vaccination records as most groomers do. Is that against the law? Trust me, Dog In Suds is a disaster waiting to happen<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0b8602b1576d:0x55ebf1160b91e3a9</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I brought in my dog here for the first time.  She was returned to me with a swollen eye, and bloody nails.  They don't take any responsibility when your pet is injured, and also deny any wrong doing.   The owner even gets mad when you complain and claims you don't know what you're talking about.  When I give my dog over to a facility and they return with a bloody paws and swollen eye, and the business doesn't even notice it until you point it out. . .this is surely a place to AVOID!!!!
My dog is like my child and this place just doesn't give a hoot!  Go there at your own risk!</Text><name>David Berman< /name>< pictures>

I can't recommend this place.   They seem really disorganized and didn't do what I asked them to do, weren't ready after I came back a second time, and gave me attitude about it.   Also very expensive compared to other groomers that we have used in the area.<//Text>

< Review>
I have used Dogs and suds a few times and my experience has been OK. Today I dropped my dog off and they told me it would be $90.00 but when I picked him up it was $100.00 , They had no explanation.  The cut looked awful, very spotty.  I had asked them to leave the fur on his head and just blend it in to a Summer golden retriever cut but they shaved most of the head at a very odd lenghth..   This will be my last time going!<//Review>

<Review>I tried several other groomers before I found this place.  I have two frisky West Highland terriers, and I've always been happy with the service at Dog In Suds. As for price, they're lower than many other places--this is an expensive area and rents on storefronts are outrageous. Thanks, Darcy and Denise!</Review>< user_id>

<Review>Very rude and disrespectful. Distasteful actually. Yes it’s covid it’s overwhelming. I know I work in fast food. I see both point of views. There were so much people in there for one about 10-15 which ridicules for it being such a small space. Two the employees where very rude. Three Me and my boyfriend had finished first, this dude really said where you next in line. Like what. I finished first ring us up and get us out of there. There’s  customers yelling. It’s Overwhelming like i said but they are very irresponsible and didn’t have a sign that should say how many people could go in. No social distancing. They could of made a sign that says 3 groups at time or only have 2-3 groups in there. Me and boyfriend were the only ones wearing gloves. Also the cashier was very rude and ignored me when I asked for two spoons and my boyfriend. Also there were literally children in there with NO MASK ON about 7-10 years old. We felt uncomfortable and rushed. Really disappointed.<//Review>< gmapID>

{'time': 1602898869035, 'text': 'Hi Jeannette, thank you for your review.  We appreciate you taking your time to let us know about your experience.  According to the health department, we have not been allowed to provide self-serve as before even though other stores were doing so.  The well being of our guests and team members come above everything else, even at the loss of income which we have suffered tremendously.   For transparency, our pricing is still solely based on weight.  Our $5.99 regular size is just over 10 oz. of frozen yogurt which is our normal price even pre-covid.  It does indeed come with one free topping that weighs more than 1 oz. Usually 11 oz of product will cost $6.16 but we are selling for $5.99.  We are working with the health department to move back to self-serve as we speak and we will do so with all the precautions in place to continue to keep our guests and team members safe.  We hope you will visit us again soon.'}<//Response>

Looked at the previous review and noticed that the manager said that they did a review of the store. Apparently they did a bad review. I came in the store and was the only customer, was denied service because I didnt have a mask while I was standing behind 8ft glass. Stores near by didnt require a mask even though the sign was posted. "where a mask shut up and obey" is how I felt.< /Review>

{'time': 1593189078490, 'text': 'Hi Sergey, according the state of CA and city of Fresno, it is required for everyone in the store to wear face masks.  We have signs stating that as well to ensure our guests and team members are safe during this pandemic. As cases are increasing in Fresno County and in CA, we want to do our part to prevent the spread even if other stores nearby are not following the guidelines/orders.  As far as you being the only one in the store, what would happen if other guests came in wearing masks and saw that we allowed someone to come in without a mask.  I hope you understand where we are coming from and that unfair one star reviews like this really hurts our business.  We apologize if that is how you felt and we hope you will come back and visit us after this is all over.'}< /Response>

Staff are super friendly and helpful. We are regulars. Would give it 5 stars if they had more variety of no sugar added. They have the same flavors over and over. They are yummy bit other munchies have different NSA.<//text>

<Review>This has been a go to place for us and our grandkids. It is semi healthy and very tasty. Can be pricey if you don't watch your toppings. Service is excellent.< /Review>< Pics>

Such a nice little froyo place I stumbled upon. What I like the most about this spot, is the "chill" toppings section where all the toppings are fresh seasonal fruit!! They have the other typical toppings too for the more sweet toothed person, so don't think they didn't think of you. Overall, very happy with this last minute stop before heading home.<//text>

<review>I was on an adventurous mood to try something new and I ordered a graduation cake on -line and paid for it in advance.  I was suppose to pick it up today, July 3, 2019.  I received a telephone message from a young lady, she indicated that they had problems with their freezers last night & my cake had melted.  I was welcome to come into and store and pick out any cake for free, so I was told at that time & they would also include the melted cake yes my milk based yogurt cake that yes... melted and also free of charge.  I went to Menchie's as was told to do so in the message I received, located at 6611 N Riverside Drive, Fresno CA., the young man told me I could only choose from 3 cakes on the bottom shelve all of which were pre-decorated saying "Happy Birthday".  I asked if they could change the writing on the cake since it was for a belated graduation surprise.  He gave me an awkward look and said no, he so nicely said the cake was free though that's all we can offer and can not change any of the cakes.  I told him I had already paid for a cake in advance and he said yes that's why it's free what else do you want.  To make a long story short, I left Menchie's without a graduation cake for the graduation party tonight and no refund.
After going back and forth and getting help from every employee in the store except the manager a young girl told me the manager said that they could not do refunds at their store, how is a refund not due and not able to be processed?  She stated that the manager would be calling back to me within a couple hours, the manager did not come out at all and made the uneducated employees handle this issue.  No apology from any employee nor ever the phone call form the manager, not that I am surprised after they way the situation was handled.  I blame this completely on the management/ownership and lack of customer service.
I also want to know who lets their employees offer a yogurt cake that melted  because the freezer wasn't working to a customer.  That is so unsanitary and could makes someone REALLY sick.  I am pretty sure that this is also a major violation of the health department.  I will NEVER do any business with this company again.  Lesson learned keep your business with Baskin Robins.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1562218258187, 'text': 'Hi Lynda, Thank you for the review.  We accept full responsibility for what happened.  We had an unexpected issue with our freezer in the early morning and as soon as we found out we had it repaired.  It did not affect the safety of the product (or any of our products).  However, the outside frosting on the cake "sagged" a little and we felt it was not a good representation of what we offer our guests.  Since it takes 1-2 days to custom create a frozen yogurt cake, we offered one of our signature cakes (3 types to choose from) that retailed for more at no cost in addition to the cake you ordered.   As far as the refund, we truly apologize for the issue. We have a new online cake ordering platform that allows us to send a refund but unfortunately it did not work.  We tried calling Menchie\'s Global Headquarters and the credit card processing company who did not return our calls due to the July 4th holiday.  As far as the manager not coming out, it was due to the fact that our shift leader was on the phone with us trying to resolve the issue (we were not present at the store).  We are working on providing you the refund for the cake.  We will contact you as soon as we know.  Again, we apologize for what happened and I hope you give us a chance to make things right.\n\nUpdate 7/4/19:  Hi Lynda, your refund was processed today and it should reflect on your account within the next few days. I attached the photo of your cake to our Facebook page where you posted a review. I apologize that the team used the term “melted”. Again, we would never compromise the safety of our guests. We completely understand how upset you were and we are very sorry that you had to go through it on a special day.'}<//response><gmap_id>0x80946f1967105ea9:0x17b3bf37c02c7a28< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Best froyo in town. The flavors rotate frequently and there's a ton of great toppings. Join the club if you go frequently, you will get free froyo pretty quickly. Not crazy expensive as long as you don't completely fill up the large cup. Even when it's busy there isn't a terrible wait and the people here are always extremely friendly. Great place to take your kids for a treat.< /Review>

This past mother's day, my nephew decided we should order a cake for my mom; the cashier was patient with me while we put in the order while I was trying to keep him occupied, and they were quick to call when I had picked a picture that wasn't available for cakes, we fixed the problem and the cake was absolutely delicious!
This evening we went in and my nephew knocked his ice cream on the floor and was heart broken because we had just paid, the woman behind the counter let us get another yogurt for him and gave him stickers to occupy him while we fixed it.
The staff has always been friendly and patient, that is the kind of customer service that I love and keeps me coming back!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80946f1967105ea9:0x17b3bf37c02c7a28<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've never liked fro-yo and when they put this place in by my house I tried it on a whim one day and fell in love. The best part is the toppings are so fresh and they have the best stuff!!! They have gluten and dairy free options and its pretty cheap compared to what I've bought in the past. Their flavors change often and they're pretty creative and good. Employees are really nice too.

I AM HOOKED TO THEIR CHAI TEA! Is it crack in there?! Is it the sweet tears of baby Jesus?! I don’t know but I’ve tried many o chai teas across the US and this is the one that takes the cake. But also the sammys are yummy and the staff are cool sweeties!< /Review>

<review>Good menu options and hip spot attached to a trendy clothing/resale store. I wish they used more sustainable packaging for their açaí bowls and drinks though.</review></record></dataset><record>
<review>First and foremost you get the fifth star for your review responses! Love the honest feedback you give! Anywho, I thought the coffee here was superb, I got their house Brew and it was to perfection! Also got a breakfast sandwich and a almond croissant which went well with the coffee. The staff here was super friendly and when I asked what coffee she would recommend since it was my first time here she didn't hesitate. Love the islander shack feeling this place gives you. I would highly recommend trying this place out, it's also locally owned and locally ran! Can't wait to be back<//review>< Response>

<Review>My daughter and I stopped for coffee here yesterday, I had a mocha and my daughter an iced coffee. Both drinks were disgusting. My mocha was made with hot chocolate powder that was stirred in and floating in chunks at the top of the drink. It as lukewarm as well. Really gross.  My daughter asked for sugar free vanilla syrup and was given full sugar syrup. How do we know? She's a Type 1 diabetic and it spiked her blood glucose. That is dangerous! Waste of $8.00. Yucky.<//Review><user_name>Linda Yourgreatfinds<//user_name>< rate>

Great walk up coffee counter located in a cool clothing store!  Nice people and the shop complements it's neighbors. If you are in a hurry and need a good cup of cauw-fee its a great choice. Support your local Independents.<//review>

Ordered a drink from here and also from Revolution roasters. We weren’t allowed to sit at “their tables” outside even though we were paying customers the staff especially Olivia was confrontational,  rude and basically were kicking us out so their friends could sit down. We love SouthO and also live here in Oceanside. this is Not neighborly place anymore. Guess were not cool enough 😂<//Text>

You will need to park and walk up in the morning it can be crowded you'll need time to wait. But, its worth it their coffee is great and taste excellent, always hits the spot and never taste funky with any of their coffee's and expressos. Black coffee even taste good, people watching is fun here too + captain's helm.<//text><response>None</response>< username>

So unprofessional and rude! NO THANK YOU👎<//review><Response>{'time': 1589324041330, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you see it that way.  I never mean to come across as rude.  I am merely responding with genuine responses to reviews people leave.  We don\'t even have a star wars bathroom. They were confused.  If someone hates their order, it happens, we\'d give a refund.  No problem. But to call something "disgusting" and "really gross" is an opinion.  To have possibly accidentally used the real sugar syrup instead of sugar free is an accident, not a horrible thing to do.  Those kinds of reviews help no one and it\'s people like them that are confident behind a keyboard, yet never would have said it to my face that distort the whole reason for reviews.  You\'re the kind of person that won\'t try a place because of this exact reason.  Not based on a helpful review, or quite frankly the large amount of good reviews we have.   Because you don\'t like how I respond to reviews?  What does that have to do with anything?  (Genuinely wanting to know, not being rude.) I think you should try us.  Then leave a review based on your actual experience.  Not leave a review to a place you\'ve never been.  That\'s rude.'}< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Well, the first few online orders went well. But, I am going to give two stars because last weeks order is still haunting me a bit. The amount processed in my account AND is still pending. Which means I am showing two amounts, one that has processed and one that is processing. And, I am still being told to wait a few days. Shouldn’t have to if it is already processed. The processing amount needs to go away. It’s screwing with my account! Once this is fixed, I may give a better rating. As long as this don’t happen again.<//Review>

I loved that store.  I used to find most of my groceries there.  The staff was always kind and very helpful.  So things have changed..  Your store no longer carries my coffee creamer and your bulk burritos have gone to singles like a convenience store, it makes me sad,  I used to be able to buy everything there now I'm gonna be going to Walmart instead.🤨< /text>

Great place to shop, better prices than a membership u have to pay at Costco down the street, from SMart & Final, great selections & better prices on their  meats, frozen foods, veggies, milk & orange juices, chips, beer, coffee creamers for ur coffee offer a good variety, & holiday items good variety on items.
HRS. are awesome on available Of open for business early to late. Great store, easy parking to park and EXIT.</text>

Super Nice Staff. They are very nice people, I drove in to pick up a load in the morning, was met by very friendly people. I don't know if it was the owner or manager, but he brought me coffee in the morning as well! It was a quick in and out. I've been driving for almost a decade now and I have never seen such a nice and respectful staff as the one from Homegrown Cold Storage. :)< /Text>

Discrepancies within the words of their employees. Was told to pick up at 6PM, which in and of itself was a sacrifice, though the product was not ready until 2AM. Probably the worst experience in my 5 years of trucking. To finalize the problem, they couldn’t even take the misinformation seriously; no respect for my time. Company doesn’t deserve your business.</Text>

<review>Nice people... but to expect load locks to stop stacked 55 gal drums is ridiculous. Barrels should be stacked with three pallets.  Bottom, middle, top, and banded together. Mickey Mouse at best. If they cared to make sure there product got to destination correctly I would have scored better but their attitude is not my responsibility to do things better or correctly!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>I work nearby and they are my go to place from chicken to pizza to subs. Delicious. The only thing I dislike its that the employees are not that friendly. I would still give them.5 stars. Just because of the food.< /Review></record>

Like this store, there is another acton market, it's pricey. The Original has freshly baked muffins for a buck fifty, huge selection of food & drinks and a nice liquor selection. Friendly staff!</text>

Acton Market is the main market for the town of Acton.  It is a new version of the old store that was located across the street.  Acton Market has an excellent grocery selection as well as a delicious/meat market and pastry shop and cafe kiosk.  The pastries and some breads are baked at the store every day and the prices are very good.  There is a small, chance, parking lot and the employees are all small-town friendly.  I sometimes stop in just to buy a coffee drink, some fresh guacamole (seasonal), or a fruit tart!

This is a great place to visit.  It is located in the quiet town of Acton which is filled with ranch-style homes, quaint old churches, vintage western-style buildings, and an occasional movie star.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>A country store with good employees and fair prices has more selection than many country stores we've visited.  The owner is friendly and customer oriented looking to win over loyal locals and those just passing through. Acton may only boast one signal light and there is often a pack donkey tied up outside but this store deserves a visit for its ambiance as well as its customer service.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>If you can find someplace with cheaper prices then shop there. Otherwise, if you just need something quickly then you have very few choices in Acton. The stores in Acton really gauge you. Other than the very high prices, they are extremely friendly and very accommodating.< /Review><time>1513572502260<//time>< Gmap_id>

I saw multiple people wearing ankle bracelets in the store and one tried to give me “ an illicit substance”: would never come back. I rather shop at the new acton market which has friendly Arabs who give people free hummus. Overall the new acton market is the place to go, never go to the original acton market because it is very pricy and dicey.<//Review>

<Review>Little gem! The quality of the breadsticks are always on point. The pizzas are as good as you can expect from little ceasers. It is in a shopping center so parking is easy. I recommend ordering on the app, it is much faster.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808de4ee7669b19d:0x8cad0a3c5c523db4</Gmap_id><userid>114729127498170194601<//userid></record>

< Review>
Its little Ceasars,  you pay for what you get. This places always seems to get the food fast enough for you to enjoy. Though I do wish the pizza didn't get cold too fast, the 7/11 pizza last a little longer warm⁹</Review>

<Review>This chain has come a long way from their $5 cardboard to now their "extra most bestest" selections. I can get a great pizza for under $10. Thanks for figuring this out and keeping things real!<//Review></record>

<text>Way better than N. Main in Salinas or on Laurel. Very friendly and even asked if we needed napkins or chilli pepper. And of course this place and any place (even the worst of the worst) is better than the Gonzales little caesars.< /text><Time>1608694612417< /Time><UserId.>102561091666781238565</UserId.>< username>

<Review>Bad customer service. The pizza had zero taste, tasted old. Don’t recommend this to anyone. If you’re looking for good pizza go somewhere else.< /Review>< UserId.>

Customer service is great and the music is nice with the environment. The noodle was delicious and had a nice spicy feel to it. This is my first time at this place and it's amazing.</Review>

Asked me to get cash then locked the door and rtold me they are closed when I returned with cash. Reminded them they told me to get cash and they finally opened the door for me. They had a  warmer full of food to sell but would rather close instead of taking cash. Pretty grumpy staff.<//Text>

Good service, pizza is still upsetting my stomach and wasn't so tasty either due to being old.  Sigh.  Yes, I trashed most of the pizza.< /text>

<Text>This place has the worst service. I called them at 9 to try and order a pizza. They did not answer my phone call. When I arrived at 9:50, they refused to make a pizza even when I offered to tip them for the inconvenience. They were rude and would not make me a pizza even when they closed in 10 minutes. I am extremely disappointed and they lost my business. I worked all day waiting for a pizza, and because my shift ran late I couldn’t have dinner. I am now starving.</Text>< time>

Great pizzas made every time, just slow service and the employees sometimes hide in the back, seems a bit understaffed. I used to work at a little ceasars and that was a reoccurring issue.</Text>

Amazing Mediterranean food!  Meats were juicy and flavorful,  veggies are fresh,  delicious sauces and great portions.   This is a must stop for Mediterranean food lovers, if you are looking for a quick stop.  Owner is super friendly and offers samples to newbies  ;-)< /Review>

<Review>My first time coming here, employees were helpful, gave my  a tray with different meats and sauces to narrow down what I'd like, it all was so good but the beef and I belive it's their secret sauce is so delicious omg I only went for a salad, but im so glad I got to try out a sample and got a plate with beef, rice and a salad with it  instead, and they gave me a free drink since it was my first time. I cannot remember the name of it but it's so refreshing on a hot day. 10/10 would definitely come again.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXXq90rL4jUmXNbWVJNSFNfC7krDRtjMzIE6oJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

The staff is friendly and helpful to newcomers, and the service is quick and easy. I would easily recommend this to others looking for great quality Mediterranean food!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>First time diner. Really impressed - delicious  food, great service,. The meats are so flavorful - we had both a beef and chicken dish, and loved both. Highly recommended!

<Review>Ordered the "spicy Caesar" salad with chicken. Paid $12.50. what I got was a container of dry lettuce leaves with about a Tbsp of parmesan cheese, soggy croutons, and the chicken on top and 2 small containers of dressing in the bag. No veggies. No pita bread on the side. Huge disappointment!!! When I got home I had to add my own cucumber, tomato and some feta to make it actually taste like a real salad. Only good thing was the chicken. Next time I'll go to Costco and buy a tub of the same lettuce for $5 and DIY it myself. Sorry guys. Thumbs down from me.< /Review></record>

First time going there and it was fast and easy! Great customer service I had a big order and they did their best to have it ready as soon as they could and all nicely packed! Even helped me to put it into my car. Definitely will be going back again, great food!< /review>

A great place to eat. A good selection of rice plates, sandwiches, and salads. Like the other 56 reviews, I give it a 5 out 5. If you don't eat here, ya got nobody to blame but yourself.<//Review>

This place is so good! I get the beef kabob and it’s so juicy and delicious. I work right next store and very happy to have a great tasting place only footsteps away. The rice is very fluffy and lite. Inside is very clean and pretty looking! The owner is a wonderful person and goes above and beyond to make sure his customers are satisfied. Keep it up!<//text>

Delicious and fresh. The owners are all so nice and the sauces are great. I recommend the urban nacho fries and I like the chicken and been rice plate. Chicken and eggplant sandwich is also great<//review>

<Text>I wish there was a 10 star. This is the BEST PLACE EVER! Food is great but even better than the food is the customer service and cleanliness. They were all masked and lovely! Thanks for the great food and exceptional service guys! Keep up the good work.</Text>< pictures>

<review>I bought a car next to this restaurant and James the sales guy recommended this place to try. I am not from the area, and there is nothing like this place in Nevada. Truly delicious and good looking food. Guess what? I am thinking about taking a trip back to CA just to eat here and visit James. Urban Fries for the win!!!!<//review>< pictures>

I go here 3x a week.  I am a vegetarian so I get the Urban House Salad. So yummy! Mixed baby greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, walnuts, cranberries, parsley, nut no cheese. I don't do well with cheese. I feel fresh after eating here. Highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.</text>

It's always dead and quiet when I go here. I enjoy it because then if I need help finding something, there's always someone available. Also, they have this giant gumball machine as a candy display. My friends and I like to take photos around it and since the store is usually empty, no one appears in the backgrounds. It's a great party store with lots of variety, but it's also a great spot to take fun photos.< /text>

Every thing for St. Patrick Day.  And big selection of candy I was not aware of.  The help could be a little more helpful.   All in all a good experience.</review>

I went into the store looking for something and they didn't have it, which was ok because Tiffani help me out a lot, my party turn out great because of her. If you ever need anything go see her.< /Review>

Employees are no help. I went in for a return and they wouldn’t take it because I didn’t have the box, I had thrown it away. I had called in advance to see if they could still give me a refund and the lady said I could as long as I had the receipt, I wasted my time and energy going because when I got their they said I couldn’t get a refund without the box. They said that the lady that I had talked to was not their.< /Text>

<review>I must say i couldn't ask for a better outcome. Today I needed insurance adjustments and Alma Lopez was spectacular with my medicare enrollment. She went above and beyond my expectations. I could feel the whole office is just as professional. Again Alma thanks so much for an awesome experience. I highly recommend!!<//review><time>1624583898568</time>< Pics>

<Text>I just finished enrolling again for my covered California plan. I had the best person on the phone, Diana! Thank you Diana for being so professional and giving me more information than I even asked for about the various plans and being so very thorough and going the extra distance to phone my specific optometrist and see if they would accept the vision plan. I totally appreciate the extra service and was very happy with your super kind and generous personality. :-)</Text>< Pictures>

I was renewing our insurance plan for 2021 and Rachel Pennington was the agent helping me.  She was very helpful , patient, professional and knowledgeable! This process can be very frustrating but she made it quite smooth and easy! I highly recommend reaching out to her for any help or questions with the enrollment process. She also provided me with Dental and Vision information. It was an informative and great experience!<//review>

Alma is like an angel from heaven. She went through different programs and different products to ensure I got the care I needed in these scary times.  I could give the staff at that place a hug but were in a Pandemic so this will have to do. Thank you thank you thank you so much!</Text>

My income recently changed and I needed to update my plan and review my insurance choice. Online led to a few frustrations, so I booked an appointment for help at this office. Alma did a fantastic job walking me through everything and finding answers to all of my questions. She made the process stress free, which is rare in the world of health insurance. Booking the appointment online was also easy, and they had plenty of convenient openings throughout the day that fit with my hectic schedule.</Review>

I just got home from this location.  When I entered, I was immediately greeting by Ruben (Security guard).  He was so warm and friendly. I felt like I had known him for a while as he is extremely easy to talk to.  I didn't wait at all. I was immediately seated with Yesenia (insurance agent).  She was also amazing!  I know nothing about insurance and she took me through what everything was.  The whole process took less than 20 minutes so very fast and efficient.  Would definitely recommend going here :)< /Text>

I was greeted at the front desk by an enthusiastic and welcoming Ruben. He put me at ease while waiting for Yesenia to walk me to her desk. Yesenia was very patient while she gathered the information she required to help me choose just the right plan for me. Thanks to both of you!</Text>

Yesenia Elias was a great help. She helped me get a better rate for my health insurance. I couldn't be happier. She really helped me and it took almost no time. There was also no wait time in this enrollment center.< /text>

Yesenia was a lifesaver. They were about to close, and she still helped me with all the patience in the world. She helped me pick the best plan for me and explained everything so clearly. Very knowledgeable and professional. Thank you so much again.</review>

I would give 10 Stars if I could!  The customer service by AlmaRosa Perez was impeccable!  Her professionalism along with her knowledge of all the  Providers and Programs was extensive! Alma went above and beyond what would be normally required to help with my specific situation... My opinion? She needs to be running the Customer Service department for this company, or any other company for that matter......because she gets it!!   Thanks again for an easy, pain free insurance experience!< /Text>

<text>This place is an absolute life-saver! Brittany has helped me both with applying for medi-cal and private health insurances. She provided me with a multitude of options and answered all my questions and beyond! Her expertise and professionalism are truly top-notch, and she makes it a pleasure to deal with some of the most unpleasant life experiences- such as losing health insurance or another major life event. If you need insurance, or advice regarding insurance, this place should be your go-to! Thanks again to this office and especially Brittany for being such an exceptional part of it!!!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I've been to this location several times. Upon my first appointment, Adella was assigned to me as my agent and from then on I have been coming back to her because she was so helpful and professional with assisting me every step of the way. This can be a stressful process, but Adella was very patient and understanding with my situation.</review>

I am here a couple times a week and this is the worst Homedepot store ever. So dirty and nothing is ever in stock. The employees are actually really nice and helpful but the store is so bad. I have employees that drive to Watsonville Homedepot before going here. Attached is the daily supply of garbage lumber and of course concrete spilled everywhere.<//review>

<Review>This is a big building. I can get lost very easy here. Good thing is every isle you walk down there is usually an employee stocking shelves so if I need assistance they are usually more than happy to stop what they are doing to show me where I want to be. The manager is also a great guy very helpful and good at his job.< /Review>< pictures>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I prefer shopping at my local hardware/lumber shops but sometimes hitting up Home Depot is a must.
The guy at the paint counter was very helpful but the Sequel store seems to always have aisles that people can't get down because there are large boxes of product blocking ease of access. This not only is a hazard in general, but if there should ever be any sort of reason people need to evacuate the building, so much stuff on the floors  could hinder a person's ability to get out safely. Extreme example, I know but the extreme sometimes needs to be thought about.
Please do a better job of keeping all the aisles neat and clean.< /review>< pics>

I spend a fair amount of time shopping here for all my basic handy needs and endurance event gear list items. Most recently I went to pickup firewood because they sell it at the best price in town and tonight call for s'mores. The staff is generally very helpful and welcoming. I do hope the they get the pipe cutter back up and running because they are definitely losing business from as ai have to travel 20 minutes to get my pipe cut and purchased elsewhere.</review>

Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff. Lots of great products and supplies for any project. One of my favorite places to shop for supplies because I can bring my dogs in the store with me. Also it's a good size store, not the biggest one I've been in but they have a lot to offer.</Text>

I usually ask 1-2 questions each trip to home depot I make (okay, maybe more), but this time a more ambitious project led to upwards of a dozen questions from staff, the most of which were addressed by Daniela. She was intelligent, polite, and knew exactly where, what and how to do everything my project called for. Singlehandedly made the experience great!</review></record>

<Text>Sure am glad there's a Home Depot in my county.  They replaced a former KMart store, and the place is always busy.  Often order online from them but needed them for a culvert project by my driveway.  Had everything we needed at good prices.  When I returned some excess items, it was easy and quick.  A long time ago, I used to have to drive to the adjacent county. EDIT: Nowadays (Sept. 2019) Home Depot quickly ships even heavier items like pails of driveway sealer weighing 50 lbs. directly to your location via a contract with FedEx.  Lots of notification and tracking.  It's free for orders over $45 at this time.  They won't ship bags of concrete, etc. this way, but anything sealed in a container, even heavy, is OK.  I've been very pleased with this zippy convenient service.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpy3q7t1ETLXTdOztbNKTcUyv17c_Ro67RMxOg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSC2YPTSAAevMpJ255C-L0oaNLc2xKib5X3Vu4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNj17SAMDHs89VZu-fO6-qkmIQMzdIgaY2NQgri=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlUQMAtvSSZlpc2ncaVSujs4P7poQDDRrhejKF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHHJnYnn6_GMyyJN8YeJaEEZXgLopusg9xDI6U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZJIHU9L3TY8qsfakRf7Nj_-yCzTwdXTR_pfaY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUZwQSbb-92oWVcFx7bfRZDCRtuYHS0ZPfD9Fg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrJ4jHSip5ZQ0anTEMzQwJTAJ_2QlpBJCAt0Uj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkjZg3hRVCt8Ij8OztqFgkQgVFl11q-DnftA7I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLppe-zj-mV98XIi_FZiIU-LEPBaD1Q9Yzbk4P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnU1V05HDSN1GTEiBWrAMFlDkxqoRYCNmPMLZU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_qgXmI2lhCsSjF8-nVrjUja0wMAjiXsjKE4tJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAN3c51mvPlVCe-1p7Rf0J5CGNSNzw0I19iK_9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJuKZSBLLK1gx6ETLIKHHb99Cud_nEnNrwtRAO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIlYmwC74uqtXClGGZNvgvh66EG83NHhfsldQd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg53TTsqvK2jYUzj1muXbK0UiEd2bwdGaqesNs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP32FF6kbEVFpw0sV6ZnBHhh9l4l9y98U_4cdNC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1p2m3QZQw9X2qJj18cHIGWnMq0qXYZwGD-Iqz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPQAcHZtnrpYeYEY_LeQUZ9r_XnIR907cFQncY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

It was a great experience. Katy at the pro desk is a true professional. And act like she truly cares. She made sure every piece of my job was together. This comes from a 35 year on the job contractor. Big thumbs up for Brian running such a tight ship and making sure people like Katy are well trained and at there best. Dave</Text>

busy and a little unorganized. the curbside pick up seemed to be taking a while as the cars that waited for curbside pick up were still in the parking stalls as I exited the store, which took me approximately 20 minutes to get what I came for. however I will say the checkout was lightning fast, which is why I gave 4 stars< /Review>

Beware of ordering subcontracted work from Home Depot! They don’t have your back.

We purchased a Dekton countertop from Home Depot in 2016, based on a long list of features that convinced us that this was the highest quality product. The sales brochure lists “impact resistance” among its many assets: notably this feature no longer appears in their sales material.

Home Depot contracts Plamar to perform the fabrication of the countertops. From the moment of delivery and installation we noticed irregularities and outright flaws along the majority of the exposed edges, especially around the radiused corners of the sink cutout. Within a couple of weeks we had a nickel sized chip become knocked out of one of these corners, caused by a thin wine glass that got knocked over. Plamar sent a worker with some plain glue to “repair” it, but we turned it down as no more than patchwork. This is the full extent that Plamar has ever supported us.

Dekton is distributed and represented by Cosentino in the Bay Area. At the time they were responsive and sent a factory technician (from Spain) to examine and repair the problem. He indicated that the Plamar fabrication was substandard and that training was essential. We were satisfied with their engagement, until the corner chip that had been repaired came apart again, without any duress.

Since then we have engaged Home Depot, Plamar and Cosentino to have them address the recurring fault. Each has passed the buck to the other in a never-ending hot potato of non-responsibility.

Home Depot has been totally disengaged and ineffective in being a customer advocate to resolve the ongoing problems with the product they sold us. The department head, Nancy, and store manager, Jose Marquez, have not returned our calls or emails, nor have they offered any assistance. I cannot recommend Home Depot for countertops, denounce their contractor Plamar as a shoddy and irresponsible fabricator, and Cosentino an unreliable material supplier who does not stand behind their marketing claims or warranty.< /text>

So they had trees on display but no sign stating they couldn’t sell them. Took the tag off, paid for it at the checkout but lady at checkout was confused why I was paying for the tree there? She told me she was going to go get someone to help me get the tree. Never showed up. I asked 4 other people and not one person was willing to help. Waited 20 min for someone to come out to help me get it but turns out they weren’t selling the display ones. Well put a sign out next time and let me know instead of making me wait outside for someone to show up.  Then I walked over to the garden department and saw they had trees they were selling. I never shop at Home Depot so I didn’t know. But a lady name JoJo was super helpful and let me know the display trees are not for sell and she was sorry nobody said anything. But yeah overall the employees were super rude and so many of them were just standing around. Blonde lady at customer service was not very nice, pretty much told me “ I’m not talking to you” when I asked her what she said, I thought she was talking to me. I got the tree I liked and it looks great in my apartment. Overall the price was good for the size of the tree. The employees there need to be trained more on customer service<//Text>

I went in there, looking for the smallest of screws. An associate asked me if I needed help then pointed out my quarry and advised me of their proper use in my application. We even spoke of our common hobby a couple of minutes. Nice experience!<//Text>

<review>Helpful staff, we had several contacts with people who helped us, I knocked them down a star only because of there stock situation, it isn't about what is out of stock, it is about what they don't carry, no dehumidifiers, you've got to drive 25 minutes to watsonville, we are a beach town, the humidity during the winter is huge. Then tons of roof patching goop, none of them clear, though their website says our soquel store carries it, again go to the other store, though they have a giant seasonal section, this store needs the basics first, then the random stuff, fake Christmas trees and plastic pumpkins are not hardware.<//review>< Pics>

<text>I've always found what I'm looking for here, except for a man. Can't seem to find a new one of those lol. My old one went sour, like rotten milk. I should probably change my profile picture...
Anyway, back to Home Depot. The first Saturday of every month Home Depot hosts a free building event for kids. They have a different project each time. Today it was a little fishing game. They ran out of those kits, so they brought out little planter kits and bird feeder kits. They provide little aprons, paint, nails, wood glue, foam brushes and everything else you need to build your project.
Wendy, from the floral department, was fantastic.</text>< Pics>

<review>It's Home Depot.  If you're one of the 1/2 of 1/3 of 1% of all Americans who hasn't set foot in one, this review isn't going to help you much.

Sadly, typical of hardware/home improvement stores generally... Minimal service, in the main cheap Chinese products, and a lot of time spent making sure that the item you're pulling out of the bin is what's supposed to be in there and wasn't randomly re-shelved incorrectly, or just tossed in a box by somebody who decided that this wasn't what they needed and didn't care to put it back where it belonged.

If you're in the trades you know, it'll get you out of a jam sometimes on the weekends, or when you need something after 5:00. A few things trade professionals need at good prices, the rest is all geared strictly toward homeowners.<//review>< Pics>

It's really hard to get help here, but thankfully they have hired a sufficient amount of people to fulfill a good Christmas tree set up. We picked out our tree and were in and out in a half hour. For others products that they carry, I would caution a buyer beware and read reviews if u pick out a product that will get high use, such as an appliance. Their online store has more assortment for big purchases<//Text>

<text>Update:
Just adding an update to the review I wrote below. It is almost a month past when they said my order would arrive. I paid thousands in advance. Every day, I call, sit on hold forever and get a status. A week ago, a trucking company called and told me that the delivery would arrive between 10-2 the following day. I stayed home all day, but it never arrived. Then they acknowledged it wasn't even in the area and they don't know who called me or why. Most days, I am told to manage the the order myself. They give me phone numbers to call the manufacturer, the shipping companies, etc... None of these places want to talk to me, because they are subcontractors/vendors of Home Depot, not me. Perhaps I should start a consulting firm that helps Home Depot customers manage the Home Depot supply chain and logistics since Home Depot expects the customer to manage it themselves? I could brand myself as a customer authorized logistical operations representative that navigates the Home Depot supply chain. In the mean-time, I am cancelling plans to install my fence for yet another week, and paying yet another month of storage for the personal property I can't put in my yard until I put up the fence.

Original Review:
Went in to Home Depot today and tried to place a large order for a Slipfence Fencing System. They took my money for most of the fencing system but said they were experiencing a software glitch that prevented them from order the remaining critical part. They gave me a veterans discount of 10% for the purchase I was able to make. The Pro-desk instructed me to order the remaining part online and immediately call customer service to get the veteran discount. I did as recommended. The customer service person explained that veteran discounts are only provided in the store and that the Pro-desk person knew that. They were unable to apply the discount. I sat on hold to speak with a Pro-desk representative at the Soquel California store. I waited for approximately 15 minutes and then someone picked up the phone and hung it up before saying "hello". I immediately called back and after 15-20 minutes, someone answered the phone. I explained the situation. They said to "hold" and that they would find someone. After being on hold for an hour, I took my phone with me to the store. I stood in line, explained the situation to someone who corrected the problem, all while I was on hold. As I was leaving the store, still on hold, after an hour and a half on hold, they hung up without picking up the phone. Really, it is my own fault for giving Home Depot Corporation my money. Live and learn.<//text>< Rate>

This is my second time having to deal with Patrick in the Door Department. This man is infuriating, did not wear his mask (or when he did it didn't cover his nose). Last time he seemed to not want to help me at all. This time a Hispanic guy wanted to buy a door and Patrick was completely unhelpful to his. The door was out of stock and he just wanted to order it. Patrick kept telling his to just go online and this guy wanted the help to ensure the right one was ordered. Really nice, yet insistent man. Luckily Ken helped us out as it took Patrick over 20 minutes to find the right door. Ken really saved the day pointing out our options for screen door jams and telling us what work we would need to perform.<//text>

Home Depot is good in the nursery department and nice assortment of plants and basically anything you need for your garden flower or veggie.  You do you have to ask for help but they will tend to your needs when asked.  I frequent the 41st Avenue store in Soquel.</Text>

I like Home Depot, but twice in last three weeks, have gone in looking for items listed as "in stock", and upon arrival, finding that they did not have it, and the  clerks were difficult to find, then reluctant to inquire nearby stores to see if it was in stock. I'd rather buy locally than online, but I guess I will have to.<//text>

The staff are nice but spread way thin. They seem to be out of stock on a good many typical hardware store items . The parking is a zoo with all kinds of people milling about ,drinking and loitering . I. Surprised the Capitola police isnt on this more.</text>

<text>I'm a simple man who would rather give my money to my local hardware store first. Then if local guy doesn't have what I need. I'm heading to HD they have got everything and great on-line ordering website. For me it's hard to get out with just what I came for. It's my favorite adult toy store.< /text><rate>3< /rate><resp>None<//resp>< date>

<Review>Home Depot is hard to beat on prices, above average on stock and availability only down side is no materials for Industrial electrical supplies. Mainly 3 phase equipment. Great service.<//Review><Name>Jamie Carr</Name><Time>1581610324345< /Time></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
horrible....I tried to get basic information regarding solar products and installation. i was told by "Jennifer" at Soquel, CA Home Depot just now  that such information is NOT available over the phone, even basic questions for example, "do you sell this product ?", etc.

??????????????????????

and that to obtain such information, or anything else about solar products and services, the customer must in fact invest (nay. WASTE) their time, money, gas, and effort, to drive in some cases a fair distance and time, to then learn "oh, no, we don't sell those"  ?????????????????????????????

when every other solar establishment in existence willingly and gladly provides such vital details by telephone to their valued customers

I simply assume Home Depot's level of customer value must not be nearly as high   ;- (< /Review>

<text>Home Depot Santa Cruz has a knowledgeable and helpful staff. The employees seem happy and most have a fair understanding of their section. They will always help you find the answer if you have a question. A good place to find your hardware needs, and things you don't need.</text>< user>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>This one star review is due to my online purchase and home delivery service.  I purchased a bathroom vanity. When I received an email telling me the potential delivery date I immediately called to let them know that I would be out of town.  I was informed that nothing could be done until I received an email with the tracking number.  I received an email with the tracking number and called Home Depot again.  I was then told that there was nothing they could do until it had been shipped. I explained that I was a little concerned because I would not be here to receive it if it had been shipped.  Longer story shortened, I returned from my trip to find a pallet with a 200 pound vanity sitting on my door stoop. I then discovered it had been sitting there for two days. It arrived right after my work crew had left, so they had no knowledge that it had been sitting there.  There was no one around to bring it into my home, so I called Home Depot. I was informed that there was nothing they could do. They don't use a service that brings it into the house in the first place.
As much as I appreciate my local Home Depot and the people who work there, I caution anyone who does an order online. Make sure you know what you're getting into before purchasing.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I find that unless you have purchased an item here before so you know they carry it and where to find it, it is hard to get in and out quickly.  This trip was one of those times when I was uncertain exactly what might do the job so 30 minutes and about a mile and a half later, I managed to come up with a solution to my problem and get back to the car.  It seems like they carry mostly high use items and I often have to leave empty handed and try the local ace hardware to get my rube goldberg project needs.  If you find what you need, the pricing is usually great.< /Text>< user_name>

<Text>Patricia from flooring was such a HUGE help for me as I navigated a complicated carpet order. I was initially irritated that my payment was declined and so called her as the supervisor at my local store, but she quickly turned around my experience and helped solve my problem. She also went above and beyond and helped me find ways to save money in my order. She has definitely helped boost my impression of Home Depot and the lengths they will go to help their customers. She has created a loyal customer.</Text>< Pics>

Store delivery its the worst they’d had lost a package before then i had to reorder and wait forever again and when they got the package delivered to them they hold on to it forever. Finally i got an email to pick up and the lady who helped did not want to look for it and told me they didn’t have the package then i had to call management and help then finally i got my package but days later when I finally started using the item it was defective i had to return and reorder again now im waiting, this time i chose to deliver at home taking the risk of having it stolen. as im typing this it’s been five days an other package got delivered at their store and I have checked three times. all they say its I have to wait.
So finally I came in and ask after 7 days, why are they taking so long, they investigated and turn out
The package was put on one of the aisle thinking it was for stocking then they searched the store and didn’t find it then I looked around and I found it so I brought it over to check out.
Last time I have to get the manager to help me get my package im guessing I will might need to that again but again what a hustle.
But despite all the trouble there are really awesome people working there willing to help you out so thumbs up for those people and not so much for the rest of them.</Text>

Couldn't find a single item on my very basic shopping list. Totally disorganized store, employees pointed me in the wrong direction multiple times (if they weren't too busy on their cell phones), and the other customers creepily staggered about like zombies. Scary place. I went to San Lorenzo Lumber instead and got everything I needed in 15 minutes.</review>

I needed help on the aisle and I had the lady at the register call three times for somebody to come to aisle 13 and they never showed up so I finally just left my cart there and went home... And the funny thing is the store was empty and no one could come and help me</Text>

Good hardware store.   Ace might have some stuff they don't and vice versa but the pricing is way better here.  Never much of a line and lots of staff on hand.   Wide variety of items.< /Review>

<Text>Not as good this time as usual. The first person I asked for help didn't seem to think about my question and waved me in the direction of the lumber department when I asked where steel bar stock was! It was a vendor two restocking shelves that ran them down for me.

Other staff were more helpful and I found the main thing I'd come looking for. I also needed to return something and that went smoothly, as always.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>DO NOT USE THEM FOR APPLIANCE INSTALLATION. They use a huge subcontractor who does NOT use licensed plumbers or technicians--and Home Depot will foist you off on this subcontractor if you have a problem. We had a dishwasher installed 2 days before going out of town. The installer mis-installed the dishwasher, disconnected the hose to our water filter leak detector, which then leaked undetected for 10 days while we were out of town, and (to add insult to injury) spilled the lemonade we gave him on the floor in the front hall and left it there for us to find. They strung us along for MONTHS and eventually denied the claim. Never ever again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

It’s very seldom in this store to find someone that is willing to help. These people are just there and so unwilling to help anybody. They really need to be taught how to handle customer service.</Review>

Went in for a toilet seat and priced DeWalt drill kits. Ended up getting the DCK278D1M1 drill kit. I wanted at least a 2A battery which it comes with and a 4A.

Not a 5 star experience as the associate in hardware couldn't tell me the first one I picked up was a 1.5A.< /Review>

Busy like crazy! Lots of dogs! Few store assistants to answer questions compared with the amount of customers. Yet, they did have the molding we were looking for, and at a reasonable price, and we were able to pay for it and arrange for delivery at the customer service desk without a wait. So, I'm a happy customer overall!!< /Review>

<Review>This one doesn't have the selection that some do. Actually I have been told that they "have just enough to get you in trouble" by the employees there.
Try across the street at the San Lorenzo lumber. They have easy drive up ,load and go, better quality.  AND they have quite a hardware store inside. I usually find what I need at SL Lumber</Review>< username>

It's Home Depot! Lots of great stuff and the help seems to be avoiding you or hiding half the time. Most of the people they hire know enough just to be dangerous so if you go there and know what you're after then you're good.<//review>

A good hardware store, but they take their name seriously, if it isn't for your home they probably don't have it.
Most of the workers here know their job quite well, they carry quite a range of products, and the prices are quite good.
Home Depot does make me pine a bit for the old-time hardware stores or you could buy bits to fix or build machines as well, but that does not seem to be the modern way.<//Review>

My husband and I purchased a garage door through Home Depot. We were told it would be delivered and installed within 6 weeks. It was not. It took closer to 8 weeks. Fast forward 2 months, and the sensors have suddenly and unexpectedly stopped working. We've tried calling Home Depot SEVERAL times but keep getting bounced between departments because no associates are there to answer the phone.
It is so disappointing, and honestly, infuriating.<//Text>

I love home Depot but their employees are lazy don't take the extra steps to find out the information you need especially if they don't work in that department if they call for a person that does work in that department don't hold your breath because no one will come. There's so many people that need a job these people should really get their act together<//text>

Lots of inventory and prices are way cheap but its always so hard to find someone to help you find something in the abyss of home DIY.  Why havent they put a map we can access on our phone?<//Review>

Home Depot has a ton of stuff, and generally at very good prices. It's my go-to for almost any hardware. They have a good return policy as well. My only concern is that the level of knowledge of the staff is hit-and-miss ... sometimes they are knowledgeable, and sometimes they aren't. This can result in (a) getting good advice, (b) getting redirected to somebody who knows a lot, or (c) getting bad advice. I've frequently found the floor staff to be a bit surly when I ask where to find something. All that said, I still go to Home Depot first unless I have a specialized request.</Text>

There is always: "We don't have it, I don't know why it shows that we have it in stock"
HD is probably for far future projects, not for repairs.
From couple years ago, HD is becoming an empty Depot and empty brain comments from sales associates (if available) like: "You could ordered online and it will be here". How i can order something that I don't know is going to break?
Having had frustrating experiences here in the past, with items supposedly in stock but mysteriously unable to be found. Luckily you can run out the "store" an hour later with something that "might work".
It's a hardware store so, please empty candy or soda shelfs and fill it with hardware!!!< /text>

<review>Great they give a veteran discount but my Amana washing machine broke when it was just a couple months old. I bought a warranty from home depot but it doesn't kick in until after the manufacturer warranty expires so because my washing machine is still new, Home Depot doesn't have anything to do with it. The manufacturer (Whirlpool) is unavailable on the weekends so I recommend buying a washing machine somewhere that if it quits working when it's still new, you can get help from someone during the weekend.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>The store is over merchandise for storage and spring. The main isle has a corridor of merchandise that makes traveling from garden to lumber almost impassable with a standard "grocery" cart and impossible with a platform or kiddie cart. Even the numbers isles have so many floor stands it's nearly impossible to pass another shopper.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough.<//text>< pictures>

Don't get me started on the washing machine. Get it together and figure out why your delivery is so slow.</text>< rate>

<review>There is a lot of stuff here only reason I didn't give it 5 stars but the staff is all uneducated and understaffed but a rare individual,  I will continue to come here when the other hardware stores dont have something available and I have done a lot of business here I rebuilt a house every room every wall every window and floor, they are understaffed and they let anyone bring there pet inside which makes it harder for me being a veteran with a real service dog. The number of times I have had aggressive dogs try to attack my dog makes me only come here if I absolutely have to, and the panhandlers and day laborers are extremely  aggressive and sketchy</review>< Pics>

Nice place with lots of neat stuff to look at. I Sometimes use their restroom when I'm around there because it's not those unisex ones that people are constantly using.  An employee came up to me in front of people and asked if I stole anything because somebody said I did.  The allegation was false of course! Today, I just went to use the restroom and than left when a security guard who works there was trying to get my attention ( I had headphones on). He told me the cops where called the other day and that the manager told me I was banned from this place, ( not true, no one told me anything!)  He wouldn't give me his name or show me his ID LONG enough to see anything. No reason was given to me by him so it's up to me to call. You can't enforce something on someone and not tell them the reason why.  It's hard enough being special needs, I don't need anymore complications in my life.</Text>< Pictures>

Convenient location, but because it's a smaller store they don't always have what you need.  Then you will need to drive to Watsonville.< /text>

<rate>2< /rate><review>I went into the Capitola Home Depot today, with my Son in Law and my grandson.  We waited for over an hour in the appliance dept. to purchase a microwave oven.  There was one lady and she said she would help us right after she helped the couple before us.  Fine, no problem, except that after waiting for an hour, she still wasn't finished with them and never called anyone else to help out.  The was also another couple after us waiting for service.

We finally left and drove over to Sears.  Walked in, found the same model, ($100 cheaper) and had it rung up and outta there in under 10 minutes.

I had the same experience last year when I bought my stove and refrigerator from Home Depot.  I had to make 4 trips back and forth to finally get them all together.

We are finished with Home Depot.  It makes no sense to have people wandering around and telling me they can't help me because it's not their department.  I worked at a hardware store when I was 18.  I didn't know much, but I sure never gave up until I found someone that could help the customer.

I'd say 3/5 times my orders are easy and ready to be loaded on our truck, and the staff helps us, which is great. They've had some inventory issues (online says in stock, in store they are out) that have caused us now 2 trips coming up empty, so if this gets better I'll give a higher rating.<//Text>

What to say about HD is hard to decide. It's a mostly generic XP... Honestly I feel bad for ppl working there as it seems like it'd suck working there... But hey consumers like HD... But it's a pretty boring store IMO 😂</Text>

< Review>
Huge department home improvement store. Easily lost in here and most of the employees cant help you find what you are looking for unless you are in the right department, but I cant blame them due to the endless amounts of product. This store really is the one stop shop for home improvement.

Edit. I came here with my boss to buy some paint for a project we were doing. The paint supply guy was so rude and disgusting to us. He didnt even want to talk to us or help us, even though we HAD to go through jim to mix our paint. Very disappointed in his service.
Still 5 stars though due to my past experiences.</Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Actually this is regarding the times listed on the web page.  I drove by tonight, 11-10-12 and the store was closed, a Sunday evening before 9 pm. I find it strange to have found it closed. I ran one other errand and am home at 9:18 pm. Is the information current?

I am returning an item that I purposefully requested help with. I asked for help and the person I asked directed me to a new person who I now know did not know faucets.  After spending considerable time installing a new faucet I find that it is not compatible with my dishwasher coupler. I now have to uninstall and install a new different faucet.

I tried to eliminate this issue altogether by asking. I would have to say that service leaves lots to be desired based on this experience.< /review>< pictures>

Easily lost in here and most of the employees cant help you find what you are looking for unless you are in the right department, but I cant blame them due to the endless amounts of product. This store really is the one stop shop for home improvement.

Edit. I came here with my boss to buy some paint for a project we were doing. The paint supply guy was so rude and disgusting to us. He didnt even want to talk to us or help us, even though we HAD to go through jim to mix our paint. Very disappointed in his service.
Still 5 stars though due to my past experiences.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I'd say 3/5 times my orders are easy and ready to be loaded on our truck, and the staff helps us, which is great. They've had some inventory issues (online says in stock, in store they are out) that have caused us now 2 trips coming up empty, so if this gets better I'll give a higher rating.< /Text>

<review>Dear OLD grouchy tool guy!
You single handedly were able to infuriate me any more than any human being ever has. My boy friend and I went into home depot in Capitola against my better judgement looking for some supplies to complete an art project of mine. Our first contact was with two friendly ladies down the fasteners isle whom helped us to get to where they keep their bulk chain. Then soon arriving on the correct isle I started looking at different chain options. Though In was not ready to buy any chain yet because I didn't know the length I needed my boy friend asked for a little help anyways. This guy took one look at me and just shook his head at me. Puzzled I stood there. And he just kept shaking his head no. So finally I said no What? No chain. To which he replied you don't want that. And just continued to shake his head as I explained what I was using it for. Now I'm no general contractor, oh wait yes I am. I apprentice for one. So I like to think I know enough of what I want to use to create something. He simply kept getting closer and closer to my face shaking his head. So before I assaulted him I simply said thanks for nothing and walked away. It was really hard to not call a manager immediately and make a huge deal out of what just happened. Then I remembered social media will sting more than me throwing a tantrum and telling on him to his manager. So word to the wise. If you think your self knowledgeable enough to help your self in such an environment. Then I highly recommend pro build right across the street. Because HOME DUMPO is trash!< /review><UserId.>113024117562982494706</UserId.>< username>

I went because I tracked my order and it was listed as delivered 3 days ago.  HD could not find it in the pick up computer.   After much searching and phoning they finally said that only one of the two cabinets had been delivered so I could not pick up even the one until the other arrived. Very disappointing since I planned the day to assemble them so my contractor could hang them.  And I couldn't even get started on the one that arrived<//Text>

I give this store a solid "Meh" rating. It's ok. Like any box store they value quantity over selection. They don't always have what you need, but if they do, they have lots of it! The items they have are reasonably priced and they typically have at least a single choice within most quality ranges. Where some stores might have the quality categories of Good/Better/Best this store has ok/good/pretty good.

As for the employee knowledge and courtesy, well, it's a bit spotty. Some of the employees I've asked for help are very knowledgeable, helpful, and patient. Others are too busy talking with other employees or have no idea where to find anything in their own workplace. I once asked an employee where to find fuel line for a lawnmower and got the response "I'm not sure. Maybe you should ask somebody". He wasn't being rude, just clueless.

I will say that the people there to help with self checkout are always quick to help and so far I've had hassle free returns, but the lady who advertises the children's activities is way too pushy and gets irritating quickly. And the solar people who hassle you every time you walk in there treat you like a second class citizen when they find out you live in a mobile home. It's like they're irritated with you for wasting their time after they hassled you.

With this store I feel like there is a good side for every bad and enough of both to warrant my continued patronage with limited expectations.</review>

Bought two gallons of paint and the paint department employee, Jose, gave me interior paint instead of exterior, and  didn't put the pigment in either can.
I got home, and had blank paint instead of brown.
The manager was rather unpleasant when I brought them back

Second bad experience.
Was accused of shop lifting.
I had my puppy with me. I'm socializing her. Was here buying cleaning supplies, and wanted to save my contractor dad a trip for a few cheap small items.  He is  Taking all business elsewhere from now on. Going to abc supply, Lowe's or San Lorenzo
I had purchased the first boxes 15 mins before for my dad, and called him when I was getting into my car to make sure I had gotten the right thing. The didnt look like the same.color box to me, so I wanted to check. These nails were to large.

I needed to exchange the nails for a smaller size.
Walked in, asked check stand if i can do an
exchange there for same product, different size, and she told me no,to walk across the store to CS desk. It had to be stamped and official. Ok.
I did, and teller nicely returned them. A security guard walked up to me as I was leaving CS and accused me of stealing them, picking them up off the shelf inside, as I didn't come in the right hand door. I explained that I had gotten the wrong size nail and needed to get smaller. Said i didn't know I had to come in right hand door to exchange for same product different size and the  check stand had directed me here.. He grunted. I walked back to nail display, got two correct boxes,and was talking to my dad, looking for the other size, and  he walks up again with back up security guard and the four boxes of nails I just returned. He demands to see my recipt, accused me agajn of stealing, of lying that i walked in to the store with rhem, and demanded to talk to the checker that checked me out as well as the gal who directed me to customer service. I told my dad I would call him.back.i said look at your security videos! They are there in my cart. He asked why I returned for boxes, and am only now holding two. Because you just came up and interupted mysearch for the right size!  was pretty angry.

The guard was scary, confrontational and accusatory! I walked to the checker that had rung me up, she said all is fine, this girl just bought those, it's ok guys.
And the guard said ok, you are free to go.
He was way to confrontational.
The checker was really apologetic. Nice checkers, but jerk manager, and scary paranoid private security.</review>< Resp>

This seems like a good Home Depot so far, with one exception... Parking is really a pain. It's hard to find a good parking space, as the lot can get really crowded.<//text>

<text>I went there for one thing when I found what I wanted it was the only one of this size left in the store and it was used and when I told the guy at the register he gave me a nice discount and I feel like I hit a home run . A three step step ladder for $5  and change out the door feel like I hit the lotto on this one.< /text>< Name>

Walked in to 41st store to get help regarding a propane patio heater and was told to look up item on their computer. The website doesn't sort by height so i was hoping a live person could help. The rep said he couldn't help but that I should call the online store :(< /text>

The store itself seems average for a big hardware store, but today I tried calling them to find out whether they have a product called "ultra cal 30."  It's kind of like plaster of paris, and I told each person on the line so.  I got disconnected once, spent a total of 15 minutes on the phone, and bounced between 4ish different departments-- no one seemed to know what department that would be in.  Three times when I got transferred to a different department on their phone system, I got transferred to the wrong one.  I don't know if this was sloppy phone handling, or if their system is screwy.  On the plus side, the people I finally got to talk to seemed nice and helpful.  But they didn't have the product, so that's 15 minutes of my life I'll never get back.  And for anyone who's looking for plaster of paris here, you want the paint department.<//Text>

Terrible! I placed an online order about a month ago and the screwed it up in multiple ways. I thought it was a fluke so I tried with another order today. They managed to screw it up too and could not care less about solving the problem. Super frustrating. I'm done with them. I'm sure they'll miss my business. haha</text>

<Review>Don't bother calling if you need to see if they even have an item.
After your transfered to the dept. they pick up the line without a greeting and than you sit on hold till you decided they don't want your business.< /Review>< response>

<text>Home Depot – I will say that I did find a person to give service in the department that I needed to be in – that doesn't happen sometimes . If they had managed to cut my order as specified before I picked it up the first time I wouldn't have had to go back .

Really pathetic customer service. They missed my delivery by 2 weeks and then returned to sender. Trying to straighten it out and I've been on hold for 35 minutes. Unacceptable.</review>
