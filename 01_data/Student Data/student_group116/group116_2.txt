< review>
I was locked out of my account. Chatted with someone who asked me for a bunch of information and then told me they couldn't help me but that I "wouldn't regret the conversation." Tried starting a new chat and now the chat feature doesn't work, and there's nobody to call. Terrible support.<//review>

<text>There have been some great titles developed and released under this company, Dead Space being just one of many and I enjoyed playing all of them. Sure some games have bugs but I recognise that part of the games industry is business orientated and like any business its how you wield your creative power that sets the creative elite individuals who have worked in under the EA banner apart from the rest. EA and its umbrella companies retain an Impressive portfolio and I look forward to more well directed titles in the future.</text>< pictures>

You've ruined the fun of gaming by making people pay for services. You've turned into a money hungry company that no longer cares about the gaming experience, just the dollar sign at the end of the day.</text>

The intent is to provide players with a sense of "pride" and "accomplishment" for reviewing different places.

As for cost, we selected initial values "based upon data from the Open Beta" and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we're looking at average per-guide credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that reviewers have challenges that are "compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via ratings".

We "appreciate" the "candid" feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Google Maps, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

Our "team" will continue to make "changes" and monitor community feedback and "update everyone" as soon and as often as we can.</text>

You deliver poorly written, structured and articulated "games" (I use that word very, very loosely) and then whack micro-transactions on top to add further injury to insult.

Fixing things that aren't broken, terrible game mechanics and gameplay tweaks. Poor all round, take good things on release and ruin them later on with updates.

Resolve the wrong issues with updates that affect no one and nothing.

Absolutely dreadful. Simple as that.< /review>< Date>

Legitimately destroying mainstream video games by making them all basically the same, refusing to make actual CONTENT for Star Wars games (even though they're the only ones allowed to make them at the moment).  Pretty sure the CEO is Satan in disguise.

I used to have Origin installed for some classic games, but honestly I'm done with EA as a company - I won't be spending a cent on them ever again.<//Review>

You can't spell steal without EA, this company has the worst customer service, and all they really care about is their micro-transactions, and how to make a buck off of you. Madden Mobile, I am looking at you specifically, you think you are creating a "fair" marketplace, when all you did was put a value to cards that you thought was acceptable. An "auction house" should be a free trade market, not controlled by you!</Review>

Visited the EA campus, had lots of fun meeting everyone, all the projects looked organized and a lot of cool games in development. I like most of their games, minus the money grubbing Star Wars Battlefront. It would've been a good day if I didn't run into a horrible staff employee that was terrible at customer service. This individual's name is Tiffany Ko. She stepped on my foot and told me to "f off". Please take caution about this person if you ever get the chance to visit the location.</Review>

They've truly earned the nickname "game killers" since every game developer they buy end up being ruined by their profit focused business methods instead of focusing on providing enjoyable content for the gaming community.<//Review>

Incompetent company and employees. They have been making games for over 20 years and they still can’t handle simple functions that a N64 could handle with ease in 1995. This company is a joke.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Probably the worst company for customer satisfaction in the industry. Master of buying great companies and wrecking great IP. The Battlefield series sealed the deal for me. Such a great studio but EA forced out abysmal releases. They were not ready to go - still at least 2 months for both BF3 and BF4. Never touching this trashy company again.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

If you’re like me and expect to get the whole product when you buy it, EA is not your kind of company. If you like any form of integrity in gaming, steer clear of EA. They’re ruining an already downhill industry shamelessly. If you want a good product don’t bother with them, they forgot how to make a decent game since the early 2000’s.</text>

EA was a super place to work in my opinion. Smart and fun colleagues, terrific quality projects, and an enchanting campus with a top-notch gym, free video games, and a couple of delicious cafeterias. Even a Starbucks in the office. Incredible. I'll always look back on EA as one of the highlights of my career.< /Review>

I paid full price for a BFII Kids Meal... but their character toys were absent.  My child really wanted a Darth Vader but was told by the management that he had to rack up 40 hours in the play area before he could get one so that he could have a sense of Pride and Accomplishment for the Darth Vader unless I purchased a randomized pack of stickers that may include tickets that could be redeemed for the Darth Vader toy.  What sort of Kids Meal doesn't include the toy in the asking price?  And then when I turned around for a second, I found that the manager was reaching into my pocket trying to grab my wallet!  Can you believe that!?  It's not like I didn't already pay for the damned meal already!

It gets worse, the other day I went in and the air was rife with a stink like something had died.  I followed the smell out of curiosity and found several corpses out back.  The police are off to contact the relatives of Visceral, Maxis and Mythic, whose bloodied nametags were still legible. The detective with whom I spoke to about the incident indicated that those men appear to have been axed.  They are still trying to identify the other 10 victims.

All in all, terrible experience, would recommend against visiting there or being employed by them, the pile of bodies were all in EA uniforms.<//review>

Loved the company but new management destroyed it and maxis. Now, after buying up such good talent such as Maxis, bullfrog and pandemic you closed all three and unfortunately now visceral has met the same fate. Why are you destroying such good game companies? You aren't the ea you used to be.<//Text>

< Review>
I have been happy to use Electronic Arts for the last decade and a complaint made against me in January 2015 was settled to our mutual satisfaction at the time almost four years ago.  I am a retired pensioner and have been playing SIMS 3 and SIMS 4 on a regular basis since they were both released.

However it seems that Customer Service has been outsourced to another country possibly for economic reasons and I now find that when installing my game to a new computer EA now have now decided to revive the already settled complaint and totally block downloads of all my extra content.  Furthermore EA are refusing to reimburse me for more than a dozen extra additions amounting to a considerable amount.

For this reason I could not recommend Electronic Arts to other computer game players.  There are other companies available who are able to supply business and sometimes at a discounted cost.

Only thing EA cares about is your money they could care less about the quality of your investment in these over priced piles. To this day games like swbf2, bf1, bf4 still have the same glitches and rubber banding issues. No matter how much time passes or untold amount of customers complain, they never actually fix them.  They just say we are working to resolve this issue to keep you content.<//review>

New agent tells me they're having an issue and to contact them tomorrow. I tell him to take my info and cancel the membership when their system is back up and he says he can't for security reasons and disconnects. I gotta hand it to EA - they're amazingly evil and are very creative at not letting you complete simple tasks like cancelling your Origin Premier Access.

I bought swbf2 and I waited to put in a few hundred hours until I could put up an honest review. EA has done what Trump has done the US, ruined. The game is riddled with bugs (still). It takes a lifetime still to acquire upgrades. The quality of the combat is trash due to the chopping since EA does not want to put in any effort to optimize their codes. EA needs a rebalancing of morals to move forward or die like the rest of the greedy pigs that run this company.< /Review>

Worst Customer Service Ever.

My Account got hacked.  Their Customer Service informed me that my account was accessed ALL OVER THE WORLD.  When I asked him which of my private information was accessed, they had 0 answers for me.  They can't even point me to the right person to get answers.

I signed up for 1 game.  I deeply regret that decision consider that all the information I provided to them was compromised.  My Credit Card that I used on EA was recently fraudulently used, I have a high suspicion that the source of that was from EA (Fraudulent activity on my Credit Card was in U.K., Customer Service informed me that my account was also accessed in U.K.).

I asked for all my information to be wiped from their server, they told me that they needed to keep some information for GDPR compliance.  That is complete bull, since GDPR is a EU regulation and have no bearing on U.S. Consumers.  When I asked which of my information will be retained, they told me to contact their legal department while giving me no contact information to their legal team.

I thought Facebook was bad at protecting my information.  Now I know EA cannot be trusted as well.  I will NEVER buy any games from EA knowing that they do not care about consumer protection at all.

<text>they used to be a good company, but now everything they do is solely to drain the wallets of brain-dead casual gamers. As a casual gamer myself, their very actions like that trigger me.

< review>
EA been going downhill for a long time. Where's the open world need for speeds and all the customization like most wanted for xbox 360 had or underground. All they want now is every penny you have. Literally one great player in madden ultimate team could cost you hundreds of dollars! The game itself brand new is only sixty dollars. Their customer service is trash. They tried telling me I could be banned from Madden depending on the outcome of a lost content claim! B.S.</review>

I enjoy playing Scrabble very much, so I paid them the required $39.99 to play the game advertisement free on Dec. 2 for the year.  I have attempted to reach them many times - to no avail.  This is shoddy business practice.  Since they have not honored this subscription payment, I will not be signing up again.</text>

You cannot possibly get to a person without logging in, and not being able to log in was exactly my problem. Their password-recovery keeps saying that it has sent your password to you, but it never shows up.  Their Toll-Free line doesn't let you get to a person (well, one option got me a silent hold for 20+ minutes), and it is Catch-22 time.  You have to be logged in to their site to even submit questions to their humans online!

I ended up having to create a new account to order anything from them and of course  _that_ email arrived in minutes!

I just wish they weren't the ones putting out Spore.<//Review>

<Review>Only employees, who are obligated to leave good reviews, say good things because EA has dropped the ball and can't respond, answer calls, or stop "fairfight" from ruining  and banning people from BF1. EA needs software that stops or records any users putting code into the game platform, so they can STOP BANNING GREAT PLAYERS !<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I can't speak about customer service or anything but based off of what I see and experience in FIFA 16 and the past few fifas, just completely horrible. Game play mechanics are crap and if you want to get anywhere in that game the player is forced to buy packs wasting so much money and giving it to people that don't even see anything wrong with their games. And don't even get me  started on madden. Madden 25, greatest madden ever. The 2 maddens after that, the definition of trash<//text>

I bought a game off of there origins software. Wouldnt download, update, nothing so cancelled my order to there own policies and procedures. I went out and bought a physical copy. Presto game installed. Then they killed both serial #s. Had to haggle with support in order to get the serial# i paid for reinstated. 2 copys 1 cancelled 1 paid for. EA's response ban my account due to the cancellation.

No customer support number. Forces you to go online and speak with a representative from india who won't understand. And i am asian indian 3rd gen. All numbers tell you to go online. Then hang up on you.< /review>

I just spent over 4 hours trying to resolve an issue and had to contact EA Support 5 times.

My issue was in regard to an advertisement on the official The Sims Facebook page which stated all Sims games were 50% off until June 16th. I attempted to purchase three games, but the prices did not reflect the advertised sale. I contacted EA Chat Support and was treated poorly by Ankit who was unwilling to help or escalate my issue to a supervisor as I requested. He simply ended the chat.

After speaking with a gentleman whose name I cannot recall, I asked to speak with a supervisor as he refused to help. I then spoke to Lalit who requested I send in a screenshot of the advertisement so they could verify the details. I did as requested and simply got a response from Ajaz M. saying, "Thanks for contacting EA, you have a God bless day...!!!!!!!!!!!!!". He then marked my issue as resolved which it was not. This was a highly unprofessional response.

I then spoke with Ayush over the phone who was able to escalate my issue to his manager who verified the screenshot of the advertisement. She authorized a 50% refund if I purchased the the games at full price. I did so and Ayush issued a refund.

I then spoke to Alejandro Jr. S. who was able to verify I will receive a refund as soon as the charge goes through.

While I appreciate the fact the advertisement was honored, I was severely disappointed in the initial lack of professionalism and willingness to help a customer who has spent copious amounts of money on not only The Sims 3, but the entire Sims franchise, something that can be easily verified by looking at my purchase history (which Alejandro did, thankfully). The amount of time it took to resolve this issue and the number of times I had to contact support is ridiculous especially due to the fact this issue could have been resolved on the first try if it had simply been escalated as I had requested. I hope in the future EA's customer support practices are improved and employees are properly trained in customer service best practices.<//Review>

Terrible customer service and absolutely no refunds...In order to talk to someone they make you go through their chat support which takes on an average of 15-20. In reality it takes more like 30 mins. When you do get to speak/chat with a representative they are very slow to respond as a tactic to make you give up. After several attempts I actually talked with a person that said they would refund my money. I checked back after a few days on how things were going the said we are sorry we cannot refund your money. I had to take it all the way to corporate and they still do not care.

This is not right we as customers should not have to go through this. We have rights as well.< /review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The games there are very good, especially The Sims, but have you ever thought of lowering the price, and perhaps making less DL'Cs (and cheaper too)? It has DLC until the grass is cute, lol. :)

(Original)
Os jogos daí são muito bons, principalmente The Sims, mas, já pensaram em abaixar o preço, e, talvez, fazer menos DL'Cs (e mais baratas também)? Tem DLC até pra grama ficar bonitinha, rs. :)</text>

One of the best auto shops I've come across in San Diego. I did a lot of research and asking around before my neighbor recommended this place.

I worked with both Jay and Brian regarding my 2007 Corolla. Because my car is older (and needed a thorough maintenance check) I was wary about which auto shop I went to because I didn't want to get unnecessary work done. Both guys were incredibly knowledgeable, honest, and realistic on what was worth getting fixed on my car, which I appreciated. I also think their prices are super reasonable.< /text>

We really needed help getting our 1978 Triumph Spitfire back on the road and the great mechanic, Robert, with years of specialized experience exceeded our expectations with solid repairs (battery, brakes, tune-up, radiator) and special parts, including finding a salvage rear axle in northern California that was necessary to get us back on the road! We passed smog tests when John fixed our car back in 2017, and today 2019 we just passed smog again! Thanks to Robert and to John's Automotive for solid work with a smile!< /Review>< user>

<Text>I took my car in at 8am on a Friday morning for engine code P0456 (Evap emissions). Brian and Jay were extremely professional and considerate of my time and offered to first change the gas cap and clear the code, which saved me from spending my day off at the mechanic and spending more $ than I may have needed to! Top notch customer service!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Been going to John’s Automotive  La Mesa (formerly Harloffs ) since early 1980’s  and it still has great mechanics and good quality service. At least 8 family cars have been serviced here over the years so I feel that is a good relationship. They have great customer service and a comfortable waiting area and they have friendly and considerate people working there. Highly recommend. My many thanks for still being there for us.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1621179199509, 'text': 'Hi Mary, We value you as a loyal customer.

I’ve taken our Car to John’s twice now. Jay at the front desk is awesome. He is knowledgeable, super friendly and does his job great. They show genuine concern for your vehicle and do everything possible to get it fixed right and back on the road as soon as possible. This is the only place we will take our families vehicles from now on. I highly recommend this shop to anyone who wants a shop you can trust.<//Review>

< Review>
My brakes went out on my work truck over the weekend and needed them fixed Monday as I need it for work. I looked up all the local shops near by that had the best ratings and reviews. Johns had the best reviews and Brian (manager) said he could get it done same day. He ball parked the price to be around $400.00 - $450.00. I was transparent with Brian about my situation and needed it done ASAP and that I’m strapped on money. He called me around 11:30 am and said it was going to cost $800.00+ for brakes and rotors which is insane.. I had to do it though because I wouldn’t have time to get it to a different shop and he knew that… Brian called me a couple hours later and said it would be ready 5:45 pm. I get to the shop with my roommate and grandma to pick the truck up and it wasn’t done. They said he (the mechanic mike) was just finishing up and need to drive it around the block to make sure it was driving fine. It’s suppose to be a mile around the block but he was gone for 15 min. He walks in and tells me that the brakes are over heating and the caliper is sticking and it’s not safe to drive. I called my boss who was a mechanic for 10 plus years and he said to ask if they put a temperature gage to it and they said they did and it was 20 degree difference.. my boss said to pay for it and drive home and he would look at it the next day. So, I told them this and the guy “helping” me got real wide eyed like he was worried and called brain (manager) and tried to tell me that I couldn’t have my truck because it wasn’t safe, then it turned into, “we want to make it right.” I told them I want my truck and want to leave. They didn’t let me pay for it and gave me my truck back. The truck is driving fine and the next day Brian called me apologizing and said, “it was a mistake.” How does a mechanic and a shop with a five star rating not know that the brakes would adjust them self? I told Brian if I was paying any money for their, “service” I would be leaving a review about my experience. Brian said he was going to push it up the later and about an hour later Bryan (higher up manager)calls me and says they could drop the price to what he originally quoted me $450.00 and that his mechanic should’ve known better and that they made a mistake. They acted like it was life and death if I drove it home. Come to find out my truck was fine and the temperature difference on the brake pads was normal, Of course the brakes were going to be hot when he drove it around for 15 min instead of a mile. This is the exact reason why people don’t trust mechanics. Sure didn’t seem like a mistake to me… be careful of this shop people<//Review>

<Text>This is the go-to place.   Professional, courteous, knowledgeable.  I’ve brought numerous vehicles them.  Cannot be happier with their service(s).   I feel additional repairs are never “forced” on me.  They give you a complete breakdown of what needs immediate attention down, to what can wait then to, later down the line this will need to get looked at.  Nothing compared to dealers where you go in for an oil change and next thing you know your walking out spending a couple hundred bucks.   I’m very meticulous about my cars (ranging from 2001-2018) and where I bring them.  I know I can call John or Brian, tell them what’s going on, drop it off and (like I always tell them, I’m in no rush just call me when it’s done) never have to worry about anything else.   Hard to find a reliable and trustworthy auto repair spot but this place is it.   I’ve already sent my roommates to John’s and they’ve also continued to bring their vehicles there and they’ve continued to be happy with their services.   Highly, highly recommend John’s Automotive Care.   Plus they have cold sodas and water 👍🏿 😄<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1599586415805, 'text': 'It is always a pleasure to see one of your vehicles come in for service or repairs, Rico.

<text>Brian was great to work with, he explained the process, sent me the estimate and we discuss it to my satisfaction. He said it would take 3-5 days depending if they found something that couldn't be seen. He called me the next day, expecting bad news, he actually let me know one of the items could actually be resolved under a KIA manufacturer recall saving me money. My car was ready on the 4th day, Jay his co-worker on the counter offered to put me in touch with someone at KIA of El Cajon, it will be there this Wednesday less than a week after picking it up. I didn't meet the mechanic\s that worked on my car but they must be not only good but honest.

<text>These guys have been so good to us. My wife and I  moved to California a little over a year ago and left behind a mechanic I had been with for 15 years. I was worried it would be difficult to find a mechanic I could trust to be honest with me, but then we found John's Automotive and Brian. Brian has been absolutely spectacular to work with. We've visited them twice with our car and both times Brian's personality, honesty and genuineness have shone through. We feel so comfortable coming in. Thanks for keeping us moving guys!<//text>< Date>

I was having issues with my 2014 Jeep Patriot. I contacted John's automotive care, and set up an appointment to have my car towed there. They called me when my car arrived and let me know they would start the diagnostic for my car. I got a call letting my know what the issue was and what options I had. They were honest and not pushy whatsoever. They even sent me an email detailing what was wrong with my car with photos. They repaired my car quickly. I am very happy with John's automotive and highly recommend them to anyone!< /text>

The customer service from John's by Jay was outstanding!  I took my car in for a noise, and instead of charging for what I did not need yet, he advised me that I could go a little longer, safely with my car in its present condition. Jay Mitchell gets 5⭐ For impeccable customer service.</review>

<text>Recently moved to the area from a different part of san diego and was looking for a new mechanic.  This shop had good reviews on Yelp so I chose them.  The shop was clean, customer service was friendly and professional.  The wheel alignment that they did fixed the thumping noise on a new car I bought that was starting to take the fun of driving it away.  So far, so good!</text>< Resp>

I talked to Ray and he was very quick to offer to send out a tow. Three days later they were still unable to replicate the problem.

They did go above and beyond to ensure that the problem did not return. I expected to pay for the time, the parts and the tow. Because the problem if it returned could cause a major accident they refused any payment and stated that it was a public service they do for their customers.

I bought and maintain this vehicle for an elderly woman to help her be independent and get to her medical appointments, and store etc. I appreciated John's Auto helping me out with such good service.< /Text>< name>

<text>Brian was very helpful and extremely polite. I got a great deal and they were 100% honest with me. I went in to you have my brakes serviced on my 2014 BMW 328i and they knew the ins and outs of my vehicle. I didn't tell them that I'm an automotive tech and that I had previously inspected my vehicle to see if they would try and sell me on a bunch of stuff that I did not need. I'm very happy to say that they passed the test with flying colors. They gave me a very fair price and even gave me a first-time discount as well as paid for my Uber home while waiting for my vehicle to be finished. I highly recommend John's automotive!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

What can I say about this place. I'll start with I came in for service but I got a lot more. The people that work here genuinely care about the people and the job. They share great stories and are very engaging with their customers. While there I learned a lot about the business. They actively participate in the Boys and Girls club cash for cars, and it seems that they donate tons of time and cash to the program. They had many customers come in that as soon as they came in, knew thier name. Everyone laughs and jokes but they get the job done. I had an oil change, headlight, and TPMS system fixed. The cost was very reasonable and the quality of work was outstanding. My wife and I have decided to make this our auto shop of preference and will give them our business. Great shop, great people, and great work. Price was great!< /Text>

John’s automotive did an excellent job on my truck. Customer service was amazing, their inspection and appraisal were accurate and affordable. I have used many different automotive shops in San Diego in the past. After this experience I will take all my vehicles to John’s and recommend them to all my friends.<//review>

Had to drop the car off after a flashing engine light. They ran the diagnostics first thing next day, then helped us get the car to the dealership where we actually had the car under warranty. This shop could have easily charged us several thousands for work, but opted to act above and beyond the expectation. I would definately return to this automotive repair shop in the future.<//review>

The employees here are amazing, very helpful and informative. I just moved here and It was my first time getting an oil change in California, this was the second automotive shop I walked into and I felt completely welcomed so I it made me want to get serviced by them. They also offered me free drinks, snacks and candy. The location is really clean and easy to find. Nice area, nice people and fabulous service. Thank you Johns Automotive Care!</review>

<Text>I was looking at buying a 4WD Lexus so I brought it here for a pre-purchase inspection.  I wanted to know if there were any mechanical issues before I bought it.  They put it up on the lift, had the wheels off, and completed a thorough inspection and identified issues and provided pictures of the trouble spots.  They only charged $89 and provided detailed assessments of the work that needed to be done.  Very happy with service.< /Text>< Pics>

Seriously the best shop I've ever been to. I've had troubles with my truck for years, been to many shops, had a lot of work done and none of those shops compare to John's Automotive. They went ABOVE AND BEYOND to help me out and make sure my truck was running great. Brian and John are genuinely great guys who want to help. They are very knowledgeable and even send an extensive email detailing your entire vehicle's maintenance, including pictures! I am blown away by this place. I left feeling so good about my choice to go there. They now have me as a customer for life. Thank you guys so much.</review>

Honest and helpful in explaining maintenance that my car will need at some point. But not at all pushy in trying to sell services, or adding things that my car does NOT need (like another guy I'd gone to). Plus they pointed out things to be aware of, which others had missed. So yeah five stars!<//Review>

This place is incredible! I’m not a local here in San Diego. I’m traveling for work from LA County for a couple of days. But my car was giving some trouble. I was directed to go to this auto shop. As I walked in, I was nervous with a thought that they will milk me and my car warranty with everything they can just, like a lot of mechanics I know from past experiences. But I was wrong! Brian was most helpful. He was genuinely concerned about helping me. He went above and beyond to make sure that I am  taken cared of. I could tell he wanted what was best for me and my car problem and not how much the company could profit from my problem. He’s a great example of customer service!</review>

I have had my Jeep at several shops in the last couple of years and spent lots of money. Still after all that it still had the Death Wabble. The Mechanics at John's greeted me and treated me like family and let me know I was in good hands. My Jeep is running and driving awesome. No Death Wabble. 5 Stars to John's Automotive. You have a lifetime customer< /Text>

<Text>I called for a quote regarding my a/c for a Honda CRV on Friday.  I was scheduled for an appointment to drop it off on Monday morning.  Probably the least painless process through and through from any mechanics shop I’ve experienced since living in San Diego.  Brian was awesome, funny, friendly, and reassuring.  This will definitely be my wife and I’s go-to mechanic shop from now on.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80d957498e517c5b:0xdea5c7f10132e814</gmap_id>< Response>

<Review>Honest and helpful in explaining maintenance that my car will need at some point. But not at all pushy in trying to sell services, or adding things that my car does NOT need (like another guy I'd gone to). Plus they pointed out things to be aware of, which others had missed. So yeah five stars!</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1566841989747, 'text': 'Sweet!

John's automotive gave me an estimate for the services requested including an overall inspection of my 2003 Chevy Tahoe. In most repair shops, they adhere to or increase the estimated cost. Dave from John's automotive, said some work was not needed as the truck was in good shape. This saved me an additional $50.00. I knew I found a good automotive after that. This is a reputable and honest establishment.< /Text>

<text>Always a pleasure to work with the people at John's Auto Repair. They made me an appointment that was quick and perfect for my busy schedule. The work was done at a price as promised and exactly on time. They included a detailed inspection of the vehicle in addition to the work performed, and spoke knowledgeably about potential future problems and recommended preventative maintenance. All without a sales pitch. Their prices are very competitive, especially compared to the Big Name Places. The best part is that they treated me not only as a valued customer - I felt like a family member. It is very easy for me to trust the safety of my family to John's Auto Repair. Definitely 2 'Thumbs up!' and 5 stars, for sure.< /text>< date>

<Text>John has carried on the tradition of high-quality auto care and customer service that practiced by Harloff's. Just recently they fixed a problem with my smog test that the dealer could not figure. The cost of that diagnosis and repair was about the same dealer charged for an unsuccessful diagnosis.  I give them my strongest recommendation. They are all very friendly  (personable) and professional.  I am so glad they there when we need them. BTW, I saw on a social-networking site where someone was thankful for the pro bono work John's crew did for them when they were in need! I Luv em :)</Text>< pics>

<Text>My experience with John's Automotive is always excellent customer satisfaction!!  Dave Carr always treat my car as if it were his own.  I will not trust the repairs to my vehicle with any other repair shop period.  Fore sure, I give John's Automotive - the highest rating of Five(5).  Women especially, can trust this shop, and not feel they will be taken advantage of.<//Text></record>

Johns automotive care completely put my mind to ease. Towed my husbands car Friday and they were done by Tuesday. Calling every chance they had to update me on my husbands car. They were also patient about payment and knew I couldn’t pay till following week. Thank you ☺️< /Review>< Time>

These guys were great! My starter went out on my car & they got me in & out on the same day. They saved me money on the parts as well. I’ll definitely be going back to these guys when & if I need work done again. Dave was also very helpful, knowledgeable & funny.

I've had some bad experiences at many local auto repair places in San Diego. However going to John's Auto Repair in Le Mesa was night and day. Brian took care of us and the entire staff was great to work with. They frequently update you with detailed pictures and that have a shuttle driver named John who is very nice. My family couldn't be happier with their flawless service and not only will we go back again, but we highly recommend this place to everyone. Way to go and great job!!!<//Review>

<Text>Excellent, personable service. Could’ve charged me thousands of dollars and I never would’ve known, instead they broke down my cars issues to me and gave me options, allowing me to choose the right repairs even if it was significantly less expensive.

<Review>This is the second time I’ve used
this great company. They diagnose your
vehicle correctly the first time in a expediant manor and keep you informed
about the progress.
If you want it done right the first time
go to John’s Automotive Care.< /Review>< Pics>

This shop is the best most honest bunch of guys I have ever dealt with at an automotive shop! Straight shooters, No Blowing smoke! I love this place.  My husband and I went here for our daughters Mini Cooper that was having an issue and they diagnosed the problem, gave us a fair quote , did the work and got the car back to us in time for her to go to work in the evening ! We have 4 vehicles and this is our automotive shop for all of them now ! Thanks Guys, y’all are awesome!!!</Text>

<review>I own a Mercedes Benz convertible and I'm picky as to who works on my car. To find a good Mercedes mechanic is hard. I live in Spring Valley and my last mechanic was in Oceanside and when he retired I was at a loss. I was told by another mechanic to go to Harloff's in La Mesa. The day I went there was rth first day of it being John's automotive. I was pleased to find out they still had the same mechanic who knows the ins and outs of a Mercedes. Every time I take my car there I know I'm getting the best service and know the job is done right. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They even have a shuttle service. Wow! I can't say enough good things about them. If you take your car there no matter what make, you will not be disappointed!< /review><username>Timothy Frederick<//username>< gmap_id>

Five stars.  Class act all the way.
One of the few repair shops that take equal care of car and car owner.

I had my oil changed and fluids topped off. The staff was friendly and helped me to make decisions about how to proceed (wait and see if things leak more) rather than make it sound dire to fix it NOW! I like that in a mechanic.

<time>1542868666960< /time><rate>5< /rate><text>I've been going to the John's automotive on Riverdale St since getting a different car over 2 years ago. However this one opened up closer to home somewhere near 6 or so months ago and it is showing the same quality of service from the other John's. Very professional, have a courtesy driver, and no complications after repairs. Now very important to me; unlike Midas, I don't see any evidence of sabotage to try to get more money out of you. I didn't know this till today but they have an after hours drop off box if you cannot bring it in the morning. Might be a little hard to do it right now with the construction going on since there is nowhere to park the car on the street, but still. Good to know for the future.

Also if you are coming in with construction during office hours and were confused like me since the main entrance was blocked off, they have a second entrance on Lowell St.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1557443895812, 'text': "Thank you for the wonderful review, Andrew!

<review>Brought in due to a noise from rear due to backing up over a concrete parking lot dividing.  Was told I needed front struts for $1500.  I paid them for  the diagnostic charge and took my car to a dealership.  Verdict: It was a loose bolt on the rear shock.  It was tightened free of charge .  There is no evidence that I needed new struts.  Either John’s Automotive care is extremely incompetent or extremely dishonest to single females.< /review>< Response>

I was here with my mother and one of my brothers, back in the 1970's.
We visited one or two nights at 36 Calle Paradora, then the new residence of Ann and Henry Oney.
Henry and others were able to make time to show my brother and I to the vegetable garden area along the north side of the mobile home park, then and there alongside eastbound U.S. Hwy. 101.
It was then and there I learned that there are Jerusalem Artichokes, also known as Sunchokes.
A wonderful, fair root crop, in a small area.
The garden area is now covered with a parking lot, where there is now a religious building establishment.</Text>

<username>kimberley gomez</username><Review>I have lived here for a couple months now, I do enjoy the area but some of the neighbors can be a bit intrusive, and bothersome. And if you are planning on working from home do not live here as it is pretty much impossible to have a good wifi provider/ network. This is due to the area, I wish I would've known this before purchasing especially with the whole COVID restrictions. Other then that the neighborhood is pretty descent.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I’ve lived at Lamplighter for just over a year and I can’t say enough about this beautiful park. The community here is very welcoming and family friendly. From the moment I met the property manager Chris I knew I found my forever home. She always greets my family and I with a warm smile and friendly welcome any time we stop by to ask questions, reserve the clubhouse or pay rent. The office environment is energetic and optimistic every day of the week! The park offers many amenities for its residents including a large club house with a billiard room, exercise facility, full kitchen and living room area. Residents can reserve the clubhouse for birthday parties, family gatherings even wedding receptions! My family and I have attended many gatherings with our church members to celebrate birthdays and baptisms, each time the clubhouse was presented to us fully furnished with many tables and plenty of chairs already set up, which saves so much time and money for us! The bonus for me is the dog park located at the entrance of the park, where my two dogs and I enjoy a good game of fetch every morning! Plus it not only has a bench to rest on after a good run but also a clean up station with complimentary clean up bags and a trash can. If you love Camarillo and want to walk outside to a beautiful view and friendly community every day, Lamplighter Mobile Home Park is the place for you and your family!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< user_id>

{'time': 1614727082935, 'text': 'Hi David, Thank you for the information you provided. We are terribly sorry to hear that you had a problem in our park and we endeavor to ensure that all residents keep their pets on a leash when outside their homes so no pets are out running loose. Since we are a neighborhood, there are people that walk through the park, some with their pets that we don’t know and of course there could be dogs that are running through unattended. We do hope that you and your pet were not injured and would hope that you could contact the office to discuss the issue at hand. We pride ourselves in maintaining a nice community and hope this unfortunate event doesn’t prevent you from passing through on your walks.'}</Resp>

<text>We have lived at Lamplighter for 20 years. I love it here. I have wonderful neighbors. The facilities are well maintained. You can say the rents are high but I could not get an apartment in the area for the amount I pay so I wouldn’t agree.  They do allow us to have pets. It is a nice safe family oriented park. The management is wonderful. They are on top of everything and extremely helpful. I will never move (I hope).< /text>< username>

<review>Decided to move here in part because they said no dogs but the amount of dogs that live and bark in MHC is ridiculous. It is non-stop barking ALL DAY LONG. Management does nothing about it. If you ever work from home DO NOT move here.
Also the parking is a nightmare. Hope you like your street lined with cars.< /review>< Gmap_id>

They say there are no dogs allowed but they do not enforce it. There are constantly yapping dogs that go uncheck all day. The neighbors are really nosey. The rent space is ridiculous and you do not get what you "pay for". They dont enforce the street parking so it's very difficult to get out of your driveway even with a back up camera. The homes that are not for sale are filled to the brim with people and they love to throw parties. It's really a shame because I love the location and the house....it is just everyone around you that will drive you insane. Neighbors who tell you there crazy sleep schedule on multiple occasions as if your life revolves around this totally arbitrary person you literally just met. Not to mention you live under a flight path not only for the local airport but also for the navy/army bases running fighter jets between 4 to 12 times a day if not more. Neighbors can be the worst but that goes ten fold for this place. I hope it improves because I really like the house and the location.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

They should pay better attention to the tweakers that live there though 😁<//review></record>

I have never seen such  abuse of power and bullying and intimidation from the management in my life. I visited disabled friend there often and her and her caregiver have been arrest and bullied for days and targeted by some old lady named Chris who has a very harsh and mean-spirited personality. Just evil .I happen to know that my friends didn't do anything wrong and she keeps siting them for things that don't exist and she's targeting them so it's basically targeted harassment on a daily basis. when a friend of mine tries to talk to her all she does is yell and his face and I happen to know that most of the people that live there just like her immensely . I mean who picks on a disabled person? In any event I would not suggest moving in there as they have really vicious management but also the rent is way too high.<//review>

I grew up here. And it's reasonably priced, near Adolfo Camarillo highschool and Rancho Rosal elementary.
Normally people think mobile home park they think old run down and white trash from movies but this one isn't.
If I could buy my own mobile home I would move in myself.</Review>

Rents are way too high and continues to go up every year. This is why homes are cheap. Very hard to sell your home once you've bought one. High turn over in management too.< /Text>

<Text>I have had multiple negative experiences with this gas station. I stay close by, and on occasion have needed gas, snacks, or most recently, change for about $3 in quarters.

I’ve had a pump fail after paying (two times in a row), only to have the old oriental lady/owner(?) at the front yell at me that it was definitely all my fault and to ‘move if you don’t like it.’

I’ve come in for snacks in the past, to be yelled at from the front of the store for pouring myself some coffee and picking up a pastry.. before I could even pay for them.

Today, in need of quarters for a meter, and determined to keep at simple as humanly possible, I walked in with $4, picked up a can of Arizona Tea (looks like everyone already understands this place refuses to help you unless you jump through all their hoops), and asked to break the remaining $2 and change into quarters. “We don’t have quarters here, no breaking dollars.” Seriously? Does this place WANT to go out of business??<//Text>< Pics>

<text>The owner, a woman, and the big guy at the register really don't know how to interact with people. They are rude and haughty, not at all pleasant or helpful. Even though I buy premium Shell gas for my car and live within two blocks of this station I don't patronize it.</text><time>1578577271878<//time><Rating>1< /Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

I purchased fuel and requested to use the air pump, at which point the woman came out to the pump and yelled at me saying I didn't spend enough on gas. Unfortunately for her, the law doesn't set a minimum fuel amount for air, and they don't have the toll free complaint number posted, which is a violation of state law.

Owners can come across very rude, however if you know exactly what you want, go in, and out without really talking they are fine. If you do not, they will follow you around the store and harass you. They are just interested in your business, nothing else. If they did not have costco muffins I would never stop in there. I would not recommend this location at all.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Clearly one of the worst gas station and Customer service. The owners are extremely rude and disrespectful. They don’t care if their gas pump was broken and they will yell at you if you just stop a few sec or use the bathroom. As an Asian myself i’m shame of that Asian couple. Absolutely speechless, do u guys know how to speak like a human being? Just because your location is kinda good does not mean you can be rude and have zero customer service. Screw you. Plz do not come, they don’t deserve your money.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Awful and super rude owners. I paid at the pump and filled the tank up, but somehow the gauge on my car showed no change. I went in to ask the lady to check if there was anything wrong with the pump machine, but she yelled at me and did not even try to look at the pump. I didn't want to waste my time talking to the lady, so went to another gas station and filled the tank up. Obviously, there was nothing wrong with my car and the gauage was charged up to. I was awfully disappointed at how the owners treat their customers. Worst gas station I've ever been to.< /Review>

< Review>
I am I 13 year old boy and i use my moms card sometimes. The owner, man, always puts everything for me on a calculator instead of the register and refuses to give me a receipt. Plus my auntie always tell a story of being me and my little brother there (who was probably 2 at the time) we had to use the bathroom. The owner, woman, said that the bathroom was only for customers. My auntie was a lil annoyed but she bought some gum cause we had to use the bathroom BAD!! The last then informed my auntie they she had to buy/or pay at least $1 for each person to use the bathroom!!?? So u want her to pay $3 to just use the bathroom??!! With 2 small children almost going to pee their pants?? That place is overpriced and unethical!!<//Review>

The owners of this place seem to nickle and dime every customer visiting this gas station.

The Valero at Shattuck & University or the Chevron at Shattuck & Ashby are less than a mile away and provide better alternatives for drivers and will be 10-30 cents less per gallon than this gas station.

Even if you buy gas the owners will still try to charge you to use the air/water pump and tell you you need to pay up.  By law, if you buy gas you're not supposed to pay extra for using air or water.  Once you tell them this they'll hand over a token.

The soapy water and squeegees provided are just regular water buckets that are usually murky and just dirty up your windshield more.

The prices here for snacks / drinks will also be much higher compared to the prices at other local gas stations in Berkeley.</text>

We stopped as my 10 year old daughter had to use the bathroom really bad. My wife took her in and was told that we had to make a purchase because "BATHROOMS WERE FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY" Mind you, we are from out of town and did not know the area.

So I turned my car around and pulled it to the pump so she could use the restroom...
As I am pumping gas, this little Asian woman came out to the pump that I was using. I had just gotten my card approved for debit and she began yelling at me at the top of her lungs!!! "BATHROOM FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY! NEXT TIME YOU PEE YOUR PANTS! I DONT CARE! YOU WHOLE FAMILY OF LIARS!!! YOU KIDS LIE!!! YOU LIE!!!" BUT I BOUGHT GAS FROM THEM FOR THE USE OF THE BATHROOM!!!

Totally unprofessional and horrible!!! I bought gas so they could use the restroom.

My question is, How are you going to turn a little kid down for using the restroom? I'm thinking of contacting the Shell corporation.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

If you spend more 5 mins in the bathroom the owners start pounding on the door. Then insult you somehow when you come out. Yes i was little tired but they don't have yell at me to go home and take a nap. They thought I had fallen asleep because I happened to be in there for 5 - 10 mins. As a Lyft driver I used this spot often but I'll find another gas station when in Berkeley< /review>

<Review>Stopped for some gas and a bathroom and the lady working the counter really rude. She wouldn't give me the key to the bathroom because she said that I was not a customer even though I did fill up gas by that point. After she saw that I did buy the gas she continued to mumble something mean instead of an apology. That was today February 20th around 6:30 p.m.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Place is slow and they talk to you like dirt shipping office is at the north end of the building no where to park to check in and they want your license plate numbers dont walk in there with a pickup number only they want all info and don't wait for a forklift driver to take your yellow paper just wait until your truck moves then take take it in</Text>

<Text>I bought a 2003 Ford Escape and I absolutely love it. The pricing was totally reasonable. The salesmen were super polite and willing to explain anything, too. Overall a great experience and I'd definitely come here again. Highly recommend Primo if you're looking for a good car with a tighter budget!<//Text>< pictures>

I've now bought 2 cars from bob, and he is amazing! I always recommend this dealership to everyone. The cars are reasonably priced, and they will last! I was able to buy not one but two cars here regardless of my credit and didnt need a cosigner. They even worked with me on the down payment! They have such great costumer service here I will never buy a car off any other lot. Matt is an amazing mechanic and is always willing to help anyone out especially with pricing. He does good work! There is a great group of gentlemen working at this dealership, highly recommend!!< /Review>

When you stop by and see a car (or two) that's perfect, you deserve a buying process that's stress-free and as flexible as possible.

<review>I Don’t recommend this place because they lie and trick you. I bought a car and it won’t work well, I brought the car three different times and they told me that it was fixed but it’s still not working. It has the same problem and my warranty is expiring soon and there are staling for time because I believe there is something wrong in the transmission and they don’t want to fix it. Don’t waste  your time and your money with this place.</review>< pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>My experience is with one of the mechanics, Matthew Tanner. He told me he was replacing some parts in my car and charged me $250. I live in Sonora so he brought the parts from the shop to my house. Instead of being honest with me when he realized he had the wrong parts, he decided to make me believe he switched the parts and then took my money. Thankfully he was dumb enough to leave the old parts in my car because a REAL mechanic told me the truth. He was confronted and I got my money back. His wife even had the audacity to say that I knew he had the wrong parts, but gave him the money anyway. Oh I forgot to mention, I'm family. And according to Matt, his boss has nothing to do with this, so I'm pretty sure he stole the parts from his work. If he can steal from his own family (and his boss) then he will not hesitate to steal from complete strangers. If you decide to take your car to this place (I really hope you don't), then steer clear from Matthew Tanner!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>6/19/15 My vehicle has been in the primo's shop since 4/30/15 having its engine rebuilt under warranty. Primo auto sales has provided me with a rental.

update 4/16/15: ....Primo Auto Sales has spent more than $1000 working to repair my car.  Yesterday, 4/15/15, they finished replacing my head gaskets, water pump, timing belt, intake valves, spark plugs and wire set, and a new radiator cap with no charge to me.  Before that, they replaced my rack and pinion, rear main seal, and and several gaskets without charging me.
Previously I paid $104 total  to have my coil pack replaced, as this was not covered by warranty.  Their mechanic Matt Tanner has personally come to my house after hours to address a braking plate dust cover that had gotten bent during a rear main seal replacement.
Since the head gasket repair, I've only noticed some smoke and bad smell  from something burning off the exhaust, also, tiny amounts of oil have dripped down, possibly a result of  residue from the previous leak. I am going in next week to have the engine washed off. The car is drivable again at this point.

4/7/15
My car has been in primo auto sale's shop for oil leaks every week since I bought it. 3 months ago. It was under warranty but the problem was never completely  resolved. The car is still leaking oil, and  now it is undriveable from another problem (cylinder 4 misfire) that  I didn't find until after the warranty period ended. I am now paying $104 to fix the broken car they sold me for $9000.<//Review>< user>

<review>After waiting so long to have my hair cut during the pandemic, I finally decided to walk into a salon now that I'm fully vaccinated. Min's service and skill is amazing for the price. It was a fresh cut that made me look younger, and he is fast too!</review>< Pictures>

Minh's been in the business for years and it shows. He cut my hair to perfection in 15 minutes and spent the rest of the time giving me the spa treatment. It was wild. He's very friendly and strikes up conversation naturally.

I'll be coming back 🙂< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Best haircut that I have gotten in a very long time. Minh is great very friendly and personable. He has been cutting hair for over 20 years and it shows. I booked an appointment very easily through yelp and when I got there I was greeted with a clean and friendly environment. He took all the Covid precautions seriously and did a great job! I will be a returning customer for a very long time.< /Review></record>

I would 10 out of 10 recommend. I got a appointment with Minh and when I walk in he sanitize every thing like the chair you are sitting on and more. It is just you and him in the room so it is really safe. He is really friendly, kind, and professional. If you are ever looking for a great hair cut then you should come here.</Review>

I would definitely recommend Minh for haircut or beard trimming, he took all the necessary precautions and everything was clean, sanitized. He even gives you massage after haircut for like 15-20 sec which is amazing.<//Review>

I have been getting my hair cut with Minh for about a year and he is always good and extremely clean especially with covid-19 that is extremely important. He is the only one at his shop so it makes me feel a little safer that I'm not mixing with a lot of different people when I come in. He also has online booking which makes it extremely easy to make an appointment. Come here and you wont be disappointed with your haircut and his service plus his cleanliness.</text>

If you are looking for a quality haircut and affordable pricing Minhs is the best! They're  always available and do a great job. I've been going here for just over 2 years now and can't recommend this place enough. They recently moved from Redwood City to San Carlos so make sure to check out their new location at 1575 Laurel St San Carlos.</text>

I moved to the bay area from LA and it was tough to leave my barber of 10 years. I did a lot of research on stylists around the area and Ming is the resounding winner. He creates a very comfortable atmosphere for his customers and my hair has never looked better. I would HIGHLY recommend getting your hair washed by him as well. He uses a very nice minty shampoo/conditioner and adds in a massage as a nice touch. Very happy I found this gem!<//text>

I’ve been going to Minh for my haircuts for 4+ years and have followed him to a few different locations. He always does fantastic work, charges a very reasonable rate and creates a personal bond with his clients. Recommend asking for him to wash your hair after a haircut as well, uses some kind of magical minty smelling shampoo and throws in a massage as well. Hard working family man, great guy and love his new location in San Carlos!< /review>

Minh is both professional and personable!  I have used his outstanding services for the past five years and my hair has never looked better. He is a color master and specializes in Brazilian Blowout. He’s in San Carlos at a beautiful location, 1575 Laurel. Simply superb!< /Text>

Minh has been cutting my hair for 14 years and he is the best hair stylist ever!  I don’t trust anyone else. I have followed him to a few different locations even if it’s a little out of my way. He is worth it! He is very consistent as he remembers exactly how I like everything and I am very particular!  His shop is also very clean.  He is also very flexible about fitting me in despite being busy.  I send my son to him as well and he too is very happy with him. I always see all kinds of people at his shop—male, female, young, old, black, white, brown, Asian, hip and stodgy — all are happy with his service. His prices are reasonable as well.  In addition he is an exceptionally nice and friendly person.< /text>

I have been going to Minh for both cut & color for 15 years! He always does a fantastic job and offers precision haircuts and great color at reasonable prices! I would highly recommend Minh. I leave his salon feeling 10 years younger every time!<//text>

<review>I usually don't write reviews but I'm compelled to tell you about Minh's.   First, I should tell you that I have challenging hair with a lot of cowlicks.  In my past, many a new hairstylist has cut my hair with the result being 'sprouts' sticking up.  Very frustrating.   I just moved to San Carlos, so I'm a little anxious of getting a bad haircut from a new stylist, especially a short hair style I prefer.  But Minh was a REAL PRO, the hair was perfect on day one and continued that way for weeks on end.  I would highly recommend him! His positive personality and attention to detail is the best!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fa302b465c7c1:0x2a003c384884f64</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My 3 boys and I have been going to Minh for haircuts for over 12 years.  We have followed him from Menlo Park to Redwood City and now to San Carlos.  His haircuts are great and the experience is fantastic.  Plus he is super nice and makes every visit thoroughly enjoyable!< /review>

Our family has been going to Minh’s for over 4 years.  And now he’s in San Carlos which is even more convenient for us!  Easy parking, walk-in or txt him beforehand to find out a good time that day. My son looks forward to a lollipop or candy after his cut. Reasonably priced, good quick cuts and friendly service keeps us as regulars.</text>

I've been going to Minh for over five years now. He is always friendly and efficient and does an amazing job. I usually call ahead to make sure he can squeeze me in, but I've never had to wait for more than 5 minutes. He treats his loyal customers like family and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else for my haircut. Minh is hands-down the best I've been to.</Review>

Minh has been cutting my hair for many years.  He cuts my daughter's hair as well at times, and if she isn't due, she will often want to go with me anyway just to see Minh.  He is a great guy (I consider him a friend), does excellent work, and his rates are extremely reasonable.  His new location in downtown San Carlos is excellent as well.  I'm not one to write reviews, but I'm happy to do so for Minh!<//Text>

Minh is great.  I've been going to his salon for several years, first near the Safeway in Menlo Park.  I followed him to his salon in Redwood City and now again to San Carlos.  He is friendly and his prices are very fair.  It's a little bit more of a drive for me now, but his service is worth it.  I highly recommend him.< /text>

I’ve been going to Minh for almost 8 years now for my Brazilian blowout and I discovered him through yelp , he never fails to deliver. He is very accommodating to my schedule. One text and he respond right away! After the Brazilian my hair is healthier and shiny... I will not entrust my hair to anyone... but only Minh can do it
Thank Minh for take care my hair for a long time<//review>

<review>Minh has been cutting my hair and my kids hair since we first met him at Supercuts in 2001. We have followed him from location to location for almost 20 years now! Minh is a terrific person and has a very clean, comfortable, air conditioned salon. His pricing is very fair ($25 for men & kids) and he does a great job! Over the years, several of my kids’ friends have started going to Minh’s for their hair cuts as a result of our recommendation. I can’t recommend Minh highly enough!< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
For the price, the pizza is not bad. Is it the best ive ever had? No. But we paid 23 dollars for a large pizza, breadsticks, pasta and cheesecake. It was all good and cheap.The service was actually really good. We had two gentleman help us and while they weren't very talkative they did their best to get our order out quickly. They do charge a dollar extra for debit, just FYI.< /Review>

I ordered breadsticks for my kids and they tasted disgusting, it had too much garlic and it was so salty, and my kids couldn't eat it. I called and all they said was "oh okay" terrible experience< /Text>

Loved it. It doesn't take that long to get your pizza when you order it upfront. Call over phone and it should be ready when you get there.< /Text>

Very bad experince asian lady name starts from S. Doesnt even know how to talk to customers. We were keep filling forms again and again. She was pretending to be super bossy to everyone. I think places like this should have educated people.

She was typing the i formation then again going back doing some personal stuff. Since there were another workers as well.

I dont know about anothers but people there on that time were preety upset.

REALLY bad experince i ll nlt recommend to try this FEDEX BRANCH TO ANYONE.</text>

<user_name>Dan Cromeenes< /user_name><Time>1570412056998</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I have a hard time believing just how bad the service here is, and I will never go back. I went in to get three pieces of music rebound with a spiral binding. I've done this multiple times before--if there's already a glued binding, they cut it off then punch and thread the spiral binding. Typically at other locations, I've gone when things aren't busy and they do it right then while I wait. There was no other customers when I went here, but the worker said I'd have to leave the music overnight, 24 hours. I pressed a little and he said he could call me when it was done. But I needed the music that evening for a rehearsal. He said he'd probably call me by then. I told him "probably" wasn't good enough since I couldn't rehearse without it. I went to gather my music scores and he said, Well I guess I could get to it right away just this once. I still hesitated and the trainee with him cajoled me, saying Come on, he's saying he'll do it right now like you wanted. So I relented. If that were it, I wouldn't have bothered with a review. But he totally ruined one of the music scores because he trimmed too much off of it and the holes and binding now run on top of the printed material. This was on one of two scores that were only stapled in the center, so had no glue to shave off. He apparently cut it to the same size of the other stapled score, even though they wasn't exactly the same size to begin with. He said, I hope that's okay. And I said, Well, there's nothing that can be done about it now, there's no way to redo it. But he had already charged my credit card for "deposit" so I essentially paid him to ruin music that I would now have to repurchase. And then I have to actually ASK him for a receipt. This is Fed Ex OFFICE--we come for business stuff, so yes I'm going to need a receipt. Except now I realize he gave me a claim check, not a receipt, and so my credit card statement shows a higher charge (because of tax I presume) than what he gave me, which makes it harder to expense it properly. Ugh. If I hadn't already been there for an hour and needed to leave I should have argued that he shouldn't charge me for that one score, and pursued a manager of some sort. Just overall so unprofessional and incompetent.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I dealt with a guy named Jake, he was extremely helpful, I had him package and send me a box that had very rare speakers that I had bought from someone in the area. I live in Michigan and he was very friendly and knowledgeable, I could have not handled this transaction without him. The whole transaction was handled with me not even being there, (the seller dropped them off to the store, again I live in Michigan) and Jake took it from there. I appreciate all of his extra time and care packaging my speakers. He definitely went way above and beyond for me.<//review><name>Eric Roos</name><user_id>110933137121596534936</user_id></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Today July 3, 2019@ 7:30pm, I was there to pick up a package. I was the only one waiting in line while the only Caucasian male employee in the store was serving another customer. When he was done with that customer, I stepped up to the counter. This employee, however, ignored me and asked out loud " who's next?". I said I was next, but again, he ignored me and went to serve another customer standing several feet away. That customer was definitely not there when I came in. It's worth noting here that the attitude of this Caucasian employee was rude and condescending.

I had to waiting for several more minutes before the Asian lady employee came over to help me.

I gave this store a 1-star rating for having such a rude employee serving customers. If FedEx wants keep this guy as a customer service agent, they must re-educate him thoroughly.<//Review>< Pictures>

The experience in this store made me so angry! The rude employee! You need serve yourself! I spent one hour on the self-sevice computers but still can’t get labels printed. I asked the employee’ help, and he shrugged and said he had no way to help, and now you can leave! The computer often have problem. My gosh, if he told me those are bad computer, I needn’t waste one hour and fill in my credit card information there! I even don’t know if these bad computers will leak my credit card information!<//text>

<Text>If it could be 0 it'd be 0. Went to ship a Christmas gift and they said the box it was in was unacceptable. Been using the same boxes to ship gifts for years. Was told the only way they'd ship it is if I bought one of their boxes and re-packaged it. It was already going to cost $20+ dollars to ship it (which I was okay with). I'm not buying your packing material to. They don't want to help you. They want to nickel and dime you. USPS will do fine as well. Don't bother going here.

Edit: shipped with USPS. They had no problem with the box. It was cheaper and its going to get there two days sooner than what Fed Ex was going to. So, yeah, don't even waste your time here.< /Text><rating>1< /rating><Time>1481790852969<//Time><userid>109429327989435535561<//userid>< Gmap_id>

<Review>BEWARE!!! If you dont want your mornings ruined, I suggest do not go to this Fed ex. Just this morning I really needed to have some papers to be printed. There was a female worker I could tell she was so lazy and didnt want to help with customers in front of me. She kept redirecting me to the copy machine and I can pay with my card. I repeatedly stated I want to pay in cash. Her voice started to change drastically and she kept telling me I needed a reference code to be able to print. I've never had to deal with a code to just print something from FedEx. I saw that she rolled her eyes at me and I pointed that out. I dont know where you guys hire your workers, but they are straight up RUDE!!</Review><user_id>114574390684135307107</user_id>< Resp>

The customer service is rude here, I want make an international shipment and I provide the destination zip code, but the zip code didn’t pop up in their system, the staff just kept asking me what is the zip code, it sounds like I have provided the wrong zip code. I told them have shipped package to this destination before and this is the correct zip code. Is it so hard for them to just say this city is out of Fedex service, instead of questioning the information provided by customer.< /text>

<Review>Absolutely zero stars but these rating websites never allow you to put zero stars. Went to deliver a package and Shirley the lady who worked at the counter had zero customer service skills, she is unprofessional and extremely rude. She told me I couldnt tape two boxes together to fit an item because it was flat rate and I specifically told her that we did not pay a flat rate, we were charged for the dimensions of the two boxes we used. The manager said to take it and she continued to argue with him that they cannot accept it. The manager was busy with another customer and she kept yelling at me to get a different box and reship it. I wasn't going to argue with her so I went back to work and got a different container. Went back to ship it and she has the audacity to mock me. "Oh good job, where did you get another box?" I completely ignored her and went straight to her manager who helped me. No apologies and no correction was done with Shirley. I dont know what the training process is but they should not be in business if customer service is not a concern to them.</Review>< Date>

<review>Same as others. Said the box was unshippable even though it was in better shape than boxes I've received from FedEx. I asked them why. Gave me every excuse. Even got a sneer. No, not metaphorically, a literal sneer. I had to pay $20 to have them re-box it. Fairly confident it's a way to boost sale numbers. Women with short hair was the epitome of rude and condescending. I was wondering why there were jokes about shipping centers being terrible. Now I know.</review>< Name>

<rate>1<//rate><review>The FedEx staff who was loading the express packages in the truck was very service oriented and professional. He gets 5 stars.

The store keeper explained that they are NOT FedEx; they are focused on office printing services and accept packages that Fed Ex picks up there. Noted that their pay and working conditions paled next to FedEx. (Don't recall asking about that.)

Refused a ground shipment in a sturdy reused box that had been delivered to me by FedEx ground. They permit no product writing on the box, some rules learned in school. Other locations and ground pick-up staff seem to have no such rules. Went to the AMC Mercado location directly, no questions as they handed me a receipt.

Maybe this store is having internal problems with FedEx.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible staff!
Just went to ship a pre-packed package at this office, an old Asian looked lady served me.
When she took over my package, right away she said it need more bubble sheet. Then she cut my tape, put a lot bubble sheets, making my box looks like a ball. When she was tying the shipping messages, she started yelling to a young lady saying she shouldn't close the printer but should close and reopen it etc...Yelled this to the girl for like a thousand time.
Keep asking me if I want overnight shipping, beyond that she said noting to me.
Made me sign before checkout, price shows $16, then made me slide my card. But after this she gave me two receipts with an additional $12 packing charge without any explain to me.
Won't tell me where the tracking number is.</Review>

Worst service ever, the so called supervisor or the lady incharge was really rude and gat no knowledge about anything she doesin the store, rather gets mad at people for asking questions to get clarification. Yes I'm one of the unfortunate one I sent a package out and wanted to ask questions regarding it but she said the work she was doing is more important than helping me and answering my question and now the package is not delivered and I'm out a $900+ item the shipping cost and all the extra hassle of course I went and visited the store many times regarding the issue and she have to say there is nothing she can do and puts me on the phone with the customer service and of course they are of no help either I highly don't recommend this place unless you want to lose your valuable assets and stuff. And yes the customer service reached out saying if I want the package back I have to pay another $350+ to get it back. Honestly people please please stay as far away you can from this place.</review>

<Text>Worst customer service ever. Very unhelpful lady, who I assume is the lead or manager. She's blamed me for breaking the printer upon me notifying the staff there was a printer jam error notification as I approached the printer. On the same visit when the other printer was causing black marks to show on my copies, I politely asked for a refund and she scoffed at me and took my personal papers out of my hands and threw them in the recycle without asking if I needed them, and walked to the register to complete my refund request with an extremely disgruntled look. Not once did she apologize for the inconvenience their machines were causing me, along with the paper I had wasted on both malfunctioning printers. I have never felt so unwelcomed by a customer service representative.

Above is my worst and last experience at this Fedex store. I've been here a handful of times before and have felt the same unwelcoming vibe from the staff but my last encounter was infuriating.< /Text>< pics>

Terrible. Zero Stars for customer service. Opened my package and stated unshippable, however they accepted same packaging multiple times before. Bring your business elsewhere 0-5 stars</Review>

Brought in several boxes already packed and sealed, but I was told they weren't packed well enough and I had to buy some of their packing materials in order to proceed with shipping.  Not only did it cost more than it should have, it took forever to open the boxes and repack them.  I've never had this experience at any other FedEx, definitely seems like standard practice at this location.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fca4665e42a95:0xf5c394ce932440b6< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I went to the fairgrounds to get my first dose of the vaccine and it was very clean and efficient. Everyone was socially distanced and wearing masks. The line of people moved very quickly and the person who gave me the vaccine was very nice and considerate. Afterwards I waited outside, which was my preference, for the time to be up so that I could check out. I am going to be back in 3 weeks for the second shot as well.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< username>

Full hookups and decent price. You are in the middle of the city so be prepared for that. Otherwise it's a good place to spend the night if you're traveling through.</Review>

<Text>Charlene the camp manager is extremely pleasant and helpful. Area is maintained well. In the heart of Ukiah so there is moderate road noise. Sites available with water and electrical service (15,30, and 50 amp) as well as less expensive sites with no hookups. Separate fee for dump station. Onsite showers and pay laundry available for guests as well as trash disposal and recycle bins available near entrance.< /Text>< Pics>

The fairgrounds in Ukiah.  Red cross bases out of here when there's a fire.  Civic functions are held in the halls.  There's a daycare here.  Concerts are held here too.  It's in town near hotels and stores.<//text>

Gated! They made it so you can't park on Mazzoni st. and gain entrance without paying for psrking. People in the new apartments on Brush will have walk very very far to State Street in order to get in or drive and pay parking despite living about two blocks away.</Review>

As my wife and I were trying to leave, we where meet by two other couples who were also trying to leave.  All of us were blocked in a a single SUV that the fair grounds people had parked in a manner that blocked in 12 vehicles.  I will never go back to the fair grounds for anything.</review><user_name>Chris Porterfield</user_name><Gmap_id>0x808164ded07be633:0x7d9e48447331a84a</Gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

Hostile staff can be genuinely scary.  Please avoid this slab of blacktop managed by racist hillbillies.</review>

I think the money we spend to stay here is ridiculous when you constantly have to fix the electricity & hope we have running water in our trailer.< /Review><response>None< /response><Rating>1< /Rating><user_id>113261008313173924095< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Pulled up and the host came right out.   We got a spot that was overgrown with tree branches.  The next spot after asking to move, was trees and mud.   All the other spots were overgrown so we ended up leaving.   This park needs to do some serious tree trimming and maintenance maintenance<//Text>< Resp>

I was able to order a hard to find lung health supplement.  When it ordered, it was shipped right away.  I had no hassles with this company.  I'm glad I was able to find this supplement.  I didn't think anyone sold it anymore.  I plan to continue to do business with HerbsPro.</review>

<gmapID>0x808f95775d36653b:0xa30a9f369c26d16c<//gmapID><review>Placed an order on Oct 26, 20.

Received items on Nov 21, 20.

Used shampoo found out all 4 bottles of shampoo contained unknown shampoo. Spoke to customer service received return label on Nov 30, 20. No explanation about giving me counterfeit shampoos.
I was told that all their items are genuine.

Herbspro sent me an email says “ Received returned item, will refund my money in 7 business days on Dec 8,20.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry that they “ have issued full refund “ On Jan 2, 21.

Herbspro customer service replied to my inquiry, they cannot issue refund due to their “technical glitch “ and “ just wait for my refund “ on Jan 7, 21.
I filed dispute transaction to my credit card company and submitted all correspond emails, proof of shipped back items, I received temporary refund from my credit company on Jan 8, 21.

Herbspro’s refund showed up on my statement on Jan 11, 21.

My favorite shampoo’s color * Alba Shampoo is clear and smell like coconut. Whatever shampoo they sent me had white color and did not smell like coconut, although they put effort on using genuine bottles.
Checked a seal of a shampoo for my pet, as soon as I removed the cap, seal came off with it. I couldn’t trust this company so I sent them all back to them.

As a consumer, shopping experience with Herbspro was just a nightmare.</review><userid>103305105235273883123<//userid><time>1611688537642<//time>< Rating>

Fast shipping is a plus! Competitive pricing is another.
However, the website offered a Free Shipping deal that didn't get applied when I went to check out, so I sent an email, and then the Free Shipping deal was removed from the website.
I guess that's responsive customer service?
Emails soliciting a 5-star review also leave me a little cool.<//text>

On time delivery.  Purchased breakable products, none were damaged. But, as with many vendors, the packaging was excessively protective.   From bubble wrap around the product, to bubble wrap around the bubble wrap to tape making it impossible to open. DO NOT MISUNDERSTAND ME, I am thrilled to receive undamaged product, but flip when it takes me 20-30 minutes to open the packaging. The product was perfect.< /review>

I go to 3 stores and buy this product for my hair,one these stores would have it. These past now few months there has been " None, Nada." I came across this HerbsPro on my Google search. I placed my order and the price for one was so low that I ordered 6.  Can't wait to receive them so my hair will look so fly again and the shine it gives my hair!!! I've been looking at your other products.4/8/21 My package from HerbsPro was delivered today and I'm happy 😁. Thank You sooooo much. High 5 to FedEx and Shop</text>

i’m so glad I found this vendor to send a product that I use daily and can no longer find on other websites. The order process was quick and easy and the tracking process was also very detailed. I do wish the shipping charge was not so high however.<//review>

<Review>I was going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. I decided on 4 because I did get the items I ordered in good condition. However, the shipping time was S L O W! It took 3-4 weeks to get this order. And meanwhile there was no communication from the company. At one point I even emailed them to see if I could get an update and got no answer! No response at all! I thought for sure I had gotten ripped off. Then randomly, weeks later this package appears. Exactly as ordered and with receipt. I don’t know if this is their normal process but it would deter me from purchasing again.< /Review>< user_id>

No response despite repeated inquiries. If you place an order use a credit card because you’ll have to file a claim.

EDIT: since leaving my initial review above, i received a direct phone call. Apparently my interaction with them occurred during a technology platform change. I was also assured a refund had been issued though I have yet to receive it. I was asked if I could delete or modify my review. Let’s see: I didn’t receive product or a refund 6 weeks after my order, there’s apparently no trace of my last email but my google review is worth a phone call? Now that’s spunk!

So while these folks clearly have some technology issues I do understand it’s just some people hustling to make a living. I hope everyone else has a better experience. As goes with any merchant, caveat emptor.

And now that I’ve spent more time than the order was worth updating this review, I can’t justify improving the rating beyond what you see here now.< /Text>< pics>

I placed an order for Band Aid Tough Strips WATERPROOF band-aids and was very  exacting about that because I had a problem with Amazon on this product.  They sent me WATERBLOCK Tough Strips.  After I finally got through to Customer Service, the person on the phone told me I had received what I had ordered.  I assured him that was not correct because I was very specific because of my problem with Amazon.  He just argued with me with no attempt to make the situation right. Never this company again!<//text>

<Review>Yes! 5 stars. Order processing/delivery in a timely manner even though I am on the opposite coast.  I haven't used product yet but I am happy with what I received.  Pricing is very reasonable. This is my first time purchasing from HerbsPro and I am sure it won't be the last. Large variety of essenses as well. Used lighter for scale.< /Review>< Time>

I got what I need from HerbsPro and it's quicker that I expect. Not only greater on the Price when compare with other company. The dose/ capsule is also higher, but the same price as a lower dose. Thank you to HerbsPro.< /text>

<text>Ordering was easy. Variety of products available and some that are difficult to get elsewhere. Product arrived packaged well and in good condition. Taste and quality are good. Only complaint is the length of time to get the products. Ordered on 12/30/20, didn't ship until 1/19/21, and I finally received on 1/26/21. I expected quicker delivery on a product that was in stock.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I’ve received 2 of 3 products I ordered, so far. Shipping was a little slow but that’s normal for this era. Look carefully at mg per serving. Good value.< /Review>

<Text>I would give Herbspro a -10 if possible.  I ordered  a pain relieving cream ($26.00) and I received a feminine product that came open and spilled during shipment.  1st I emailed them and got no response. Then I called them, and even though I had an order confirmation of what I ordered, their "customer service " rep repeatedly argued with me that I got what I ordered.  So I sent them a copy of the order confirmation with another email.  Their response was "thank you for confirmation of receiving your order".  BUYER BE WARE!!!!!!!!! just throw your money in the trash can because that's what you will be doing if you buy from this place!< /Text>< pics>

<text>1. Shipping my 6 bottles of gingko biloba took SEVERAL weeks.
2.  I rec'd an emailed customer service satisfaction survey, but I instead wrote to Customer Service letting the company know I couldn't give them a high RATING on the survey, due to slow shipping.  Nobody responded.
3.  One of the capsules in one of the bottles was empty, and it's contents had covered all of the other capsules with powder--so I called Customer Service to request an exchange.
4.  I had a hard time with the rep, who didn't allow me to speak with a supervisor but said, "Our shipping department will send you a return shipping label."  However, I do not have faith I will get a replacement bottle.
5.  If all goes well, I'll edit this review to reflect having had a better overall experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1619563063373, 'text': "Hello Allie.

Also, the package did not show up on my USPS Informed Delivery page, which is supposed to notify me whenever mail is delivered.  It was just dumb luck that my caretaker came over the day the package was left in my mailbox (I am disabled and cannot get out to the street where the mailbox is).  Had it sat there a day or longer, in this high crime, drug dealing neighborhood I have to live in, it would have been stolen.<//text>< pictures>

Great experience with this company!  They fulfilled everything they offered;
my item at best price in comparison to others (I ordered DiaresQ which I had difficulty finding at a reasonable price.  I learned about it from Dr. Oz and it's a great product for a natural heal for food poisonings that cause diarreah ) and quick delivery!  I will order from them again.  Thank you!</Review>

<text>I finally received the order after one month and after going to the website to inquire why it was late. I had never received even a confirmation email and yet the cost was listed as pending on my CC. later, the pending disappeared altogether confusing me as I wasn't charged. thats when I went to the site to see whats going on and finally it was sent. No, I'm sorry I can't recommend this business. I thank the online worker who finally got my order to me though. She was smart!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Salicylic bandaids I needed for my daughter were hard to find.  Glad HerbsPro carried them.  Order took 9 business days to arrive, so wish they could have processed a little more quickly,.  Tracking showed the package didn’t arrive at the transport facility until 5 days after order was submitted.  That’s the only reason I took a star off.< /text>

If you are looking to get your product in a timely manner, I would move onto another company. In today's  online selling and shipping this was a long long wait for the product to even be shipped, when they said it shipped, 10 days later,  it still took 7 days to get from CA to OR. While waiting, I tried to cancel the order, which I believe moved them to ship it, I ordered from another company and received Puritian's order within days and it comes from back east. Prices are also a little higher at HerbsPro than other online vitamin stores. So in the long run, I would recommend you shop around before buying from HerbsPro. The product I purchased was as described.< /Review>

<review>I ordered a product and they sent me the wrong brand - a product that sounds similar but is in fact entirely different - and it took several weeks to arrive. When I rechecked their website, they have the wrong image next to the product. I wrote an email to their support team asking how I could remedy this, and two days later got an email thanking me for confirming receipt of my order and asking me to give a positive review. So here I am - I plan on calling them to try to rectify this.</review>< Pics>

Hyssop Tea is an excellent deterrent to catching the full influence of the flu if you begin drinking this at the first sign of becoming I'll.  That's how learned about this tea because it worked for me and continues to work. I do not like to be without it in my home .</text>

My order took a long time and initially for almost two weeks when I logged in it said I had no orders placed which concerned me. Customer service chats did promise the order existed. I received my order several weeks later from the time of ordering and one of my items did leak in the box covering other items. Not sure if I will shop here again because I’m not overly impressed.< /Review>

This was my first time ordering from HerbsPro.  I not only received the best price for what I ordered, but I also received it sooner than it was promised.
I will definitely be ordering from this company again.</Review>

The pricing is what brought me to your company, plus the products. Your customer service is awesome as well. The only hitch in the process was the delivery process, not a fan of how long it took DHL to move package through their system. In the end the product arrived 4 days earlier than their tracking revealed.<//Review>

< review>
I received products from them on Dec 31st that were damaged. After contacting them 4 different times to get a refund, I finally disputed via my credit card. The company is claiming I received the product & shouldn't get a refund. Well yes, I did receive the product, but I received DAMAGED goods & now all of a sudden, they don't want to accept responsibility. Hoping to have things resolved via my credit card, since apparently this company doesn't care about their customers!</review>

Bad experience.   Paid for items shown as "in stock" on their web site.  Over $50 worth of bar soaps.  They actually had none in stock, and they took a month to send me an email showing a refund.  The credit card still does not show the refund, so a dispute has been opened.  These people are to be avoided.  Ordered 12/12; Dispute opened 12/13;  Notice of cancellation from HP: 12/18/20;  Notice of refund from HP: 1/13/21; Dispute closed by bank in our favor:  2/12/21.  This whole exercise took two months.  No items ever shipped.  No resolution necessary, as order was cancelled and resolved by credit card company.<//text>

Order was placed on Jan 13th and was not shipped until Jan 28th. Price point was great. Too slow shipping and correspondence about shipment was never returned.< /review>

The top of the bottle of mayo, wasn't on securely. I have gotten items from other companies, that packaged glass containers differently, by securing bubble wrap tightly around the jar. It took over a week 2 get here, so this is also part of why I gave 3 stars.< /text>

I waited 2 weeks for a reply to these 3 emails and nothing. I had to wait for eBay to refund my money and they wouldn't until we went through the full dispute process which was another two weeks, then it took 4 days for the cash to go back into my account. So it was almost 9 weeks total from the time they took my money, to when I was able to get a refund. The seller completely ignored my messages and the ones from eBay customer service. Don't order from here! They have gone downhill! Amazon has even shut them down on their platform for fraudulent activities.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808f95775d36653b:0xa30a9f369c26d16c<//GmapID></record>

Excellent price on the blood pressure monitor I bought and
excellent delivery time.  HerbsPros seems to be  a reputable vendor and I would buy from them again.</Review>

I also found out that it was an item that I could pick up for $2 less.

<pics>None< /pics><text>I won't buy again. HerbsPro is an outfit that masquerades as an American company. I ordered boxes of tea that my local market ceased carrying. How absurd that the international carrier DHL sent these tiny tea boxes, first to the other side of the country, then domestic mail to a sorting location, then to me. Minimize your carbon footprint! Do without,  is my lesson learned.< /text></record>

My order history is really two orders. The first one took over a month to get to me and then ALL of the glass bottles inside were broken. This would mean 1 star, or zero if possible. The response to that order was then really great. I received the replacement order in 4 days and all glass bottles were in perfect shape. Hopefully, that is the standard by which HerbsPro operates. Time will tell. When the item is needed again, I will probably give them one more chance.< /Review>

< Review>
While placing an order, which was supposed to be shipped for free, it automatically changed the shipping to priority mail, $37.00 for shipping on a $50 order, without giving me any option to stop the charge process.  How fraudulent is that!  I sent several full cancellation emails and phone messages for a full refund.  We’ll see if that works.  Also filling dispute charge with Visa.  What a rip off!<//Review>

Always accurate and quick on delivery. Prices are usually the best online. They did have a delay in shipping one item in my order, but they sent updates along the way about restocking and delivery expectancy. Received all my items packaged well too! Thank you for being such a reliable shop.< /Review>

I ordered 4 bottles of product and when I received them, the tops had been cracked and each bottle was leaking from the cracks.  It was clearly damaged in shipping, but I also noticed there was little packing in the box.  Suchetta took my call and we discussed  what needed to be done.  She was so helpful and professional.  I appreciate her willingness to help my with this problem.  Her attitude and helpfulness was outstanding.< /review>

Reviewing their customer service, not necessarily their products. I placed an order and was sent a confirmation email but there was no way to check on the status of the order without calling the company (as I did not create an account before purchasing). Nor did they answer my two emails asking for an update on shipping. Called 2 weeks after ordering and was informed that my order "should ship in the next 1 to 2 days". 8 days later, no update yet. I will call again and I understand that shipping times are longer than usual, I just would like to be kept in the loop as far as order status and feel that emails/online inquiries should be answered.< /Review>

I called to find out why and nobody ever answered, so I went with another online company for my order.

Herbspro has an awesome range of products: supplements and vitamin that you need. Shipping might take a while depending on where you are, but that is understandable considering the situation nowadays. Their customer service is great as well, very helpful for follow-ups and inquiries. :)</review>

<review>Not even worth 1 star !!!

Your service was the worst of any online vendor we have ever dealt with.

You took over 2 weeks to deliver our order.

You shipped an incorrect item

Contacting your customer service by telephone was a horrifying experience, contacting by e-mail was no better.

You did not respond to any of our 4 telephone voice mails or 4 e-mails.

The correct item was finally received yesterday (took roughly a month).

We returned the incorrect item via USPS yesterday.

We will NEVER use your service again.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1602277993770<//time>< resp>

I've only had the wrist brace for two days. I don't find it helps much, mostly wearing it reminds me not to use my sore wrist as much.</Review>

<UserId.>109724912191979821763</UserId.><text>HerbsPro has low-unbeatable prices for a vast variety of health products. After placing two orders on their website, I experienced over 10 days delay in shipping, and less than adequate Customer Service first-line responders. However, I got an exceptional support from the Customer Service manager, who turned my overall experience to be a positive one. (I was told the shipment delays were caused by the need to replenish out of stock products from their suppliers.)<//text><rating>4< /rating></record>

<text>Herbs Pro has excellent products that really work. It is a very simple process to get you on the way to feeling like your 21 year old self again when you are really in your 40’s. Let’s get that libido pumping and testosterone level back up where it needs to be and most of all get rid of the stomach. Exercise time without feeling bad afterwards. Thanks Herbs pro I’ll be back next month.</text>< pics>

<Text>Hello HerbsPro,

My cardiologist advised me to get a blood pressure monitor and the nurses recommended Omron. I went to the nearby CVS and saw they were rather pricey so the pharmacist recommended I go online. When I saw your price, which is about  one-quarter of the one at CVS, I was skeptical. But I've received the monitor and used it for the first time today and everything seems to be in working order.

I hope it continues to give me good readings, and if I can afford my own personal CAT scan someday, I know where to go!

Best regards,

The processing times seems long and they did not send all of my order.  I had to contact them to ask where the missing item was.  This could have easily been remedied by a simple email explaining that there were 2 packages or that they discovered the error and the missing item had been shipped. The quality of products are great.<//review>

<Text>Disgusting service.
No answer to my questions about order in email, no tracking number.
I finally got it in one month  instead of one week.
I don’t need it anymore.</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I Treasure Herbspro. They have so many items I cannot find in the stores.  Over the Years I have dealt with them, there has been a couple of issues.  Broken cookies, when I reported it, the very gracious representative said to keep the broken chocolate cookies and use them to top ice cream. They shipped me new  ones. Then I received a lovely letter. THANKING me for being a good customer. Professionalism, Kindness, Incredible Stock and the idea of The Customer "Matters"  will keep me using this company.  It Just keeps getting better and better.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

I had to wait a few minutes to get a live agent, but they promptly figured out the best solution for me. I give them credit for even staying open during such a lousy time but am thankful for them so that I could get my supplements.<//Review>< Pictures>

Amazing prices.  UPS delivered my order to the wrong address.  Initially HerbsPro was slow in responding to my queries, but eventually a very cordial HerbsPro rep called, evidently willing to do whatever it would have taken to solve the problem.  (In the meantime the person who received my package brought it to me.)  I'll be a repeat customer.<//text>

<text>Recently, I came across HerbsPro while I was looking to purchase vitamins.  The price was great, so I thought I would give it a try. I definitely will give 5 Stars to HerbsPro and will continue purchasing from HerbsPro.  The entire experience is awesome, the customer services from Sucheta are superb (explain thoroughly, patiently, and honestly).  The products are great and the shipping is fast.  I have already recommending HerbsPro to my siblings.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>I am glad to mention these next few words in favor of Herbspro. They really care about service and quality. They also package everything really well and their delivery is always on time. Though I had an issue with my last order, upon request, they sent me a return shipping label along with a replacement product.
This is my favorite online health store. Your satisfaction is guaranteed here. They carry items that no other store on the internet does.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have had really good shopping experience with Herbspro. Their website is user friendly, their prices are amazing, they offer free shipping if your order is large enough, and they get your stuff to you very quickly.  I did have one order take longer than usual, but it was during the COVID-19 practical shut down, and all things considered, that went well also. They even emailed me to let me know they were swamped and my order would take longer than usual.  I would recommend them for sure!</review>

Having not received my order, I chatted online to ask if it had been shipped a week after the anticipated ship date.  The representative confirmed it would be shipped within a few days and that I would receive tracking info.  Of course, I was concerned since the payment was processed on the day I ordered, although delayed shipments can be expected right now due to the high demand with COVID-19.</Review>

<review>My experience with HerbsPro was like back in the 50's when customer service was the height of the sale.  Even with a snag, Trom and Sucheta were just amazing people - saved the day! HerbsPro is very blessed to have these two fine employees! 5 Star for sure!!< /review><pics>None< /pics><name>PatriotQ45 PatriotQ45< /name><rating>5< /rating>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Ordered something 12/13/19 and was told at time of order it would ship within 3-5 days.  I was charged for this order on 12/13/19.  1/8/2020 The order had still not shipped.  Called customer service held three times for 15+ minutes and each time got hung up on as they answered.  Called back and pressed one for placing an order instead of number 2 for customer service and low and behold they answered immediately.  I was told the order would ship in a few days.  When asked why it was charged for but not shipped....crickets.  I asked to cancel my order and he said canceled, anything else Mam?  I asked for a confirmation number and was quickly given one.  Hoping I will get my money refunded but I have my doubts.  DO NOT ORDER from this COMPANY!!!!<//Review>

Great company to buy my monthly stock of supplements. Everytime I order - seamless transaction, the products arrived in just a few days. Packed beautifully, and everything in the box was as it should be. I have found some items on their website that no one else carries. Herbspro is good!< /review>

I ordered some Whey protein powder through PayPal. after three weeks of getting no email confirmation, I called four times and each time after holding for several minutes, I was cut off. I sent two messages through their website and never received a reply. Out of frustration, I had to contact PayPal and request a refund.  I do not recommend HerbsPro.<//Review>

I do feel like this company does do whatever they can to have a satisfied customer. I appreciate the communication I received until my order was picked up.   This covid19 did cause a lot of trouble and delays, but they were very responsive and corrected an issue I had with a delivery to a wrong address. Thank you Herbpro for all you did.< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I ordered from Herbspro on 02/28. Expected ship date: 03/03. I still haven't received what I ordered.

I reached out to customer service via phone & email without a response on 6 occasions, including their sales support. No answer, just a voicemail.

I do not recommend this business. I have contacted my credit card company to report fraud on purchased goods not received.<//text>< pictures>

<pictures>None< /pictures><time>1591132506332<//time><Review>Edit: After leaving this review and a voicemail with the company I was promptly contacted by the head of customer service who graciously  addressed my issue and concerns. She updated me on the status of my order and moved to ship the available items from my order today while we wait for the other items to be fulfilled by the manufacturer. This is the kind of customer service I really appreciate!

Poor customer service team and communication. I understand shipping times are slow during these times, but have not received any communication about items I ordered being on backorder, nor has there been an attempt to ship items that are currently available in waiting. Online chat representative was completely unprofessional, unresponsive, and did not handle this issue with care. Trying to contact them to cancel my order and still unsuccessful. Would not attempt to order from them again—back to iHerb and Vitacost.< /Review>< Name>

<text>I tried to place an order with Sucheta and she was very helpful.
However, Herbspro website and especially the order page was not functioning very well, and I could not place my order. My order placed was taking way too long to confirm. I would encourage the owners of this company to contact their IT Dept to fix this important problem. I almost cancelled my order, but Sucheta went out of her way to place my order for me - she was wonderful and extremely professional. I would recommend anyone who wants to place an order to ask for Sucheta! I look froward to receiving my order i hope in a timely manner.<//text>< user_id>

Vicious criminals. Took money. Gave me a false tracking number from DHL. Lied about the shipping date. They don't answer the phone or e-mails. They were 3rd party sellers on Amazon-but not now. Amazon refunded my money. I hope they go under before they ripoff anyone else.< /Text>

<text>The product I have received over the past 5 years has been useful and until the last 2 orders quickly delivered. The last 2 orders have taken almost 3 weeks to be delivered even though it is in stock. I am not sure what has changed however when you are taking suppliments you do not want a gap so it is essential to know the amount of delivery time.< /text>< Rating>

It’s been over two weeks and I have not received my order.  There’s been zero communication from the company since they took my payment.  I should have read the company reviews before ordering.  I’m going to assume I’ll never receive my order and move on with my life.  Typically, I do not write reviews but I’m hoping to save an unsuspecting potential customer from losing their hard earned money.</Text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>It took a whole month to receive my item, I wasn't even sure that I would ever get it. I sent an email after waiting 2 weeks for my purchase
to find out what was happening with my order and I never got a reply back. When I first placed my order I received an email stating that my order was processing. I then recieved an email the next day asking for a review, how can I review a company on anything if I just purchased from them a day before! I never got an email stating my item was ever shipped. I couldn't check my order on their site because they don't have any way for you to check your status. I wish I would have read all the negative reviews before purchasing from HerbsPro.</Review>< UserId.>

Awful - Took 16 days to get my product and then when I did get it today, the plastic container was shattered into little broken pieces and the grooming wipes  for my dog are all dried out.  The package should have had bubble wrap around it.  Also, should not take 16 days to deliver.  Contacted them and told them I want a replacement or my $$ back.  He said he will send replacement.  We'll see if I ever get it.

UPDATE: Happy to report this vendor did in fact replace product free of charge.</text>

<Review>It take times to get a phone call from them. I have been waiting for my order for more than ten days and they didn't even update my order status!!! Luckily, they reached me shortly and solved my problem. Now I am waiting for my order coming. Hopefully, It will arrive on time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I ordered a product on August 20.  They shipped it Aug. 23, 2016.  They said it would be delivered to me between August 26-31.  I never got it, so I emailed them.  They told me to wait another five days!!  It's been over five days, and I still have not received my order.  I cannot track it, and they refuse to do it for me or even give me an accurate tracking number.  Today is September 5, 2016, two weeks since they shipped it.  I now have to wait until tomorrow, since today is Labor Day and no mail.  Never again will I order from this company.< /text>< UserId.>

Not impressed.  Poor customer service.  I sent an e-mail to ask where my order was - no reply.  My order finally arrived 16 days after my credit card was charged - and it's missing an item.  There are other companies out there with much better service.<//review>

<Review>Ordered a product. Never received a confirmation email but was billed through PayPal. Called on day five after not receiving item and left voicemail. No one returned my call. Day 7 I call again and get the run around from a middle eastern call center that does not know what's going on nor can they find the order in the system. Finally find order and tell me it should be shipped out in the next couple of days. Guess I'll wait and see if it ever actually shows up...< /Review>< pictures>

They deserve  (-)....but there is no such an option, so I put for them the lowest possible. This is, without any doubt, the worst company I run across last 20+years. They never answer phone calls, shipping from CA to AZ is one day with FedEx or USPS. They used DHL....and couldn't deliver for 10 (ten) days. When I called to order...there was an indian (from india) with broken English, hard to understand....I should got away at that point....I learned that lesson the hard way.</Review>

Horrible customer service.  Supposedly order was processed right away but I received no communication regarding shipping.  Had to push and was told that 3 of the items were not in stock​ but it should be shipped in two to three days.  Two weeks later I had to go onto the website to find out any information on the order and found that it had finally shipped but would take 12 days to get the product.  I will not order from this company in the future.</Review>

< Review>
I'm a regular customer! I've received products that are hard to find that ships locally to California and Herbspro got it to me the very next day. I wasn't expecting it but I was super happy it came so quickly. Thank you!!!< /Review>

<text>Worst customer service ever. Never return your call. Shipped only part of the order to me two weeks after the ordered was placed. Even asked me to pay for return shipping if I return the partial order. A Google Trusted Store turned out to be not reliable at all...< /text>< date>

I never received what I ordered and when I called they told me it would be shipped in a day or 2. Complete lie. This company must be a scam. Do not order from this place unless you want to be ripped off.< /Text>

They call and harass you about the feedback you leave.  HORRIBLE COMPANY.  Order never arrived and they don't care!  No refund offered. Stay FAR FAR away from this company,< /Text>
