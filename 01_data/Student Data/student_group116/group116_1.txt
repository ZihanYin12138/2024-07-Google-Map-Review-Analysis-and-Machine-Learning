This pizza is YUM!  We love ordering from
here.  The crust is so delicious.  The toppings fresh and plentiful.  We order ours with light on the sauce.  Excellent and always quality.< /review>

<review>We moved to Southern California about a year ago and one of the our best discoveries was Leucadia’s. We ordered from here nearly weekly to satisfy our pizza fix but it’s so much more than that. I say this with no hesitation; every single thing we’ve ordered from this menu has been excellent. Not just good, excellent. Appetizers, soups, salads, pastas, desserts, and absolutely the best cauliflower crust pizza we’ve ever found. We have ordered and tried every specialty pizza they offer and they made it very hard to settle on favorites but the Roasted Garlic Shrimp, the Greek, and Deluxe with broccoli were our mainstays. Priced affordably, in fact I don’t know how they aren’t losing money on the Lobster Pizza with the amount of tail meat they put on it. Delivered by the store with exceptional courtesy and no contact options. A rewards program that quickly gives you money off your future orders. Online ordering. Need I gush more?

We always ordered from the Carlsbad location and I should have done this review a year ago because they deserve people knowing what a fantastic job they’ve been doing throughout the entirety of this Covid pandemic. Sadly, we have moved north closer to LA and are now out of delivery range but I assure you, when we travel down towards San Diego next, I hope you’ve got outdoor seating so we can enjoy some favorites again.

P.S. if you’re thinking about expanding in the future, Irvine’s nice. Just sayin’.

P.P.S any chance you could tell me where you get those cauliflower crusts?<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Leucadia Carlsbad is our go to place for catering and family meals. Dougie and the staff are friendly and professional. Pizza and spaghetti are crowd pleasers. Margherita pizza is always the first to disappear, followed by combo, the tomato bisque soup fabulous. Bologonese and meatballs always a hit. Thank you for the pleasing Italian experience every time!</review>

<Text>We were heading back to our hotel from LEGOLAND and found this place from a google search. Was surprised to find just and storefront in a strip mall but the door was WONDERFUL! We ordered simple for the kids and more gourmet for us. The pizza and salad were easy to find non-traditional vegetarian options and were very good. Not cheap in price or quality. Worth the price.</Text>< resp>

Leucadia pizza is high quality food and excellent customer service.  I recommend the pear and gorgonzola pizza and lobster mac and cheese.</text>

<review>Tonight I went in to buy a gluten free pizza like I normally do. The girl that normally helps me was on the phone taking an order. A driver help me and took my order I ordered my usual a large gluten free with extra sauce pepperoni and Olive. The girl who was on the phone help me by handing me my pizza I had told her I had Branch with it she gave me one I had asked if I could have two from the driver and I offered to pay for it he said no I'll just give them to you. When I told her what the driver said she paid no attention and charged me for the extra Ranch she didn't even give me peppers or Parmesan cheese or plates. This is what I usually get offered or it's already in a bag but she did not want to give me these things. I don't know what her problem was but her attitude sucked and if I have been the manager and saw that I would of fired her on the spot! I gave the kitty of pizza the lowest rating tonight and it deserved it. I can't hardly wait to see the owner so I can tell him and give him a piece of my mind. I will never buy a pizza from this place ever again and I suggest to anybody else not support this place because it has no integrity. A big F for failure! 😡😠< /review>< time>

We ordered and picked up a couple pizzas from Leucadia Pizza and took it to the whole family at the beach. It was so delicious and the menu so impressive that we ordered dinner that night delivered to our VBRO home at the beach and everything was amazingly good. Everyone got to order what they wanted and leftovers for the next day!! Wish we discovered this place earlier in the week!<//Review>

<Review>Be wary of the other reviews, the one-stars in particular paint an inaccurate picture due to petty reasons (apparently  a driver forgetting the ranch warrants the worst possible rating).

I've been eager to try this place since it replaced the old (but certainly not gold) Pizza Shuttle that closed down. We got carryout, and I ordered the chicken fingers appetizer. The food arrived fresh and hot in sufficient packaging. I loved the meal I ordered; the chicken was high quality with an authentic style of breading, and I received far more food than I expected for a price of $7.49! I also tried their pepperoni pizza, which was absolutely delicious. A soft dough combined with a crispy crust and a cheese that melted in your mouth yielded an excellent slice. Overall, I would definitely recommend this location for its food quality and excellent prices, and I will certainly order from here again in the future. 👌<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It's hard to get a margherita pizza or standard calzone wrong, but the ones we got were only okay -- not much to write about. Perhaps this was because their regular dough/crust was so sweet? (I don't know that I've ever had pizza crust that sugary). The gluten-free crust on the BBQ chicken pizza we ordered was pretty disappointing.</review>

Just called to order a pizza and wanted the black olives removed and garlic substituted on a large deluxe pizza, and when asked about the price there was a charge for the garlic addition, but I removed the olives so it should be the same price.  So I canceled the order.  How cheap can a place get?</Review>

<text>The kids were starving, we ordered our pizza at the beach and we were told that the pizza would arrive in 30 minutes. 40 minutes later, we called and the manager Jill told me that the pizza would be arriving in one minutes, so we waited in the parking lot. After another ten minutes we called again and were told that it would be another ten minutes. After ten more minutes, I called the phone number and again Jill picked up and said "I know, you have been waiting 56 minutes. Your pizza will be there soon!"..then she hung up! Finally the pizza person arrived, we were told that we were the third delivery on  the list. Someone could have told us this instead of lying and repeatedly saying that the pizza would arrive any minute. We will never be ordering from Leucadia Pizza again, thanks to the horrible service and false promises!<//text>< Pictures>

<Name>Yule Owens<//Name><Review>Hot Hot HOT! If you're shooting out here during the summer be prepared for the HEAT! The location is an extremely cool (pun intended) place to film. I've shot here a number of times and each time I'm in awe of this place in the middle of no where. Plenty of parking near and far from set depending on what kind of shot you need. Definitely be aware of snakes and scorpions and other creepy  crawlers!< /Review><GmapID>0x80c3abb05f65da19:0x6d5bc2c0193c79da<//GmapID></record>

<date>1487962259927</date><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Beautiful example of days gone by. I'm glad to see that it doesn't have public access, or it probably wouldn't exist any more. The poor excuse of a human who is the caretaker/owner or what have you was completely unwound when I walked up to the chained off driveway to the restaurant. I'm a local photographer here in the high desert and understand privacy and appreciate  preservation, which I hope to do through my images of the desert areas, but people with unwarranted attitudes like the imbecile I ran into there are one of the reasons I enjoy the solitude of the desert in the first place. Better luck to you visiting this place.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The Club Ed movie set / location is one of the most recognizable desert locations for countless TV commercials, TV shows, music videos and feature films.

It sits on 150th street east, which is also used for film and TV shooting quite a bit.

Located to the south about 1.5 miles away is another filming location called 4 Aces.< /Text>

I actually saw this location on a commercial for Xarelto. If you live in the High Desert of the Antelope Valley, this is on the eastern end.  There is a caretaker on the property, so be please be respectful if you go by. Photo op only.<//review>

<username>Robert Oswald</username><text>Worst caretaker(s) on the face of the earth. My wife & I simply stopped in front of the place and proceeded to take pictures and some little man with an obvious hatred for life and everyone in it, came aggressively over to us and started yelling at us about what we were doing. He then told us to get behind the fence (which we already were). I then proceed to ask who he was and never once did he identify himself or give any reason for his animosity. We now know you have to arrange tours but that doesn't excuse his outrageous behavior toward two excited & innocently ignorant travelers. Bad form and seriously unacceptable actions. And I only hit the 1 star because without it, you can't post.<//text>< pictures>

Disgusting, racist, vile, waste of the earth people run this place. RACIST OLD CROOKS!!!! Heed my advice along with the other reviews you see. Racist hotheads work here, HORRIBLE people. Will cuss and threaten at you and used racial slurs on my crew during a film shoot. Disgusting behavior. Sad humans. They have some junk in their soul. Listen to me and all these other reviews when I say stay away from this place if it's the last place on earth.< /text>

< Review>
Excellent customer service. Amazing patience with toddler 1st time preballet customer. Made her very happy. Is it cheaper on Amazon? Yes but would miss the hands-on experience and teaching my toddler about fabric quality. Support your local businesses!</Review>

<Review>I love this place! They are always there to help. I have a performance and had a question about tights. Within seconds did I have an answer and they are just nice people. Great selection of apparel and good quality. Recomend this place for ballet clothes and dance shoes< /Review>< username>

<review>Outside of the decent fuel prices, this is not one of the better locations... It's on a busy corner near a fwy onramp and offramp, so the congestion that builds up makes this one of the most difficult gas stations to navigate... Secondly,,, there's only 2 fueling islands... Sorry folks but I only go here if I happen ta be in the vicinity and I'm already near the driveway...<//review>< pics>

This place is a scam. Their machines force you to automatically choose the highest priced option even when you did NOT select it. They also ONLY offer debit card payment I think for this exact reason. These people are SCAMERS. They should be shut down.< /Text>

<Review>I stopped by a few minutes ago around 9.45 pm and the doors were already locked (google says its 24 hrs). I forgot to bring my wallet and cash was my only option. Staffs did not even care and said "well we already closed he register, so.." and shut the door in front of my face. Did not get to see her name, just know she was a cashier, bigger build around 25-27 yo.
Not a good one.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>Price seemed ok to me, I think it was something like $2.48/gal in 10/2016 for their midrange (if the pumps were honest)... but one of the girls behind the counter kind of had an "attitude" problem.  Not sure what that was all about.<//review>< Pictures>

The pump kept stopping even when I held it with my hand. Decided not to fill up all the way as a result. Also the video on the pump kept playing over and over. Just a tad annoying.<//text>

<text>Joey is an amazing man. He lives music and musicians. He knows the economy and his fair prices reflect an honest and reasonable approach to the prices of the things we need.
Rudy is a very honest and kind representative of Mr. Joey's..

<text>When i first moved here to San Diego from Ventura i was missing the music store i used to visit. I walked into Mr. Joeys when they were still located in Lemon Grove. They made me feel comfortable and the positive vibe of the place did remind me of the place i used to visit. Joey and Rudy are cool people. Feels good to have a place like this. Music store with a soul and personality unlike the corporate big box ones that take the fun out playing music.< /text>< GmapID>

Super nice people, very helpful. They can do repairs, sales and lessons. Joey and everyone there are active musicians so they know what they are talking about. I think they do rentals as well. Their rehearsal studios are great and can accommodate from individuals to multiple people or a whole band. Very honest group of people to deal with.<//review>

Great people, not robots. I deal with Joey and he always treats me with respect. Also have talked to the tech there and he really knows what  he is doing. Good people, good prices. Let's  all support Mr. Joeys shop.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been taking singing lessons weekly with Rudy for over a year.  I learned how to project my voice and breathe appropriately in the first few lessons.  We work the solid hour; not a forty five min. hour.

Mr. Joey is honest, down to earth, and very helpful.   His inventory of musical instruments is vast.  I discover new and used gems in the store regularly.<//Review>

I met Rudy Vasquez through Craigslist. He's the best voice coach I have had . My first singing lessons went well and I can sing and project my voice more than I ever expected. I'm more confident about my singing abilities and eventually want to sing in a band. Rudy can teach anyone to sing . I never thought I could sing! My voice has a range I never knew.

Joey and Rudy also know all about musical equipment and only sell the best quality .</review>

We love this restaurant. A must go place if you are fan of Indian sindhi style food. Great variety for chicken and goat options. Our most fav is their Sindhi biryani which is all the way different from Hyderabadi biryani you get in any Indian restaurant.
Staff and owners are super courteous and friendly.  If food quality is more important for you than only ambiance then its highly recommended place.<//review>

< review>
Dinner included an interesting brain masala as a specialty, which was totally unusual and tasty, like sweetbreads with sauce. The other meat dishes were small in size and a bit oily. The vegetarian dishes seemed bigger although served in the same dishes. The naans cooked in their tandoor ovens were ok, the winner being the aloo naan (spicy!). Atmosphere was friendly, and rowdy like a big family dinner.< /review>

Loved the atmosphere, service, and complimentary Chai Tea.
STRONGLY DISLIKED the food.
Waited a long time. Then when my chicken curry dish came it was on a baby plate with 3 tiny little drumsticks covered in curry. I was starving, so I asked the waiter if this was it?!
He said yes, but brought out another 2 bites of a different curry dish, which was nice.
Neither were really good and the one I ordered was tough to not get a piece of bone with every bite.! I swear I almost cracked my tooth. No wonder he told me to order rice! I would have still been starving when I left.
The drive home, I was so bloated and sick feeling, it was awful. I usually love curries!
Think I'll pass next time.</Review>

Years ago, I used to live in SF attending the CA Culinary Academy and was Shalimar's frequent customer (Jones street).
Tonight, I got my favorite Tandoori Chicken Breast & Leg and Ground Beef Kebab.
Incredibly delicious! Very happy we finally have Shalimar in Folsom.</review>

Stay away People. Horrible customer service, we went there today with my 2 toddlers kids, had very bad customers service. They doesnt know how to talk. We just wanted to seat on the bigger table because we have to keep my baby on the table. The guy comes and says we cannot seat there. If they had no seats available,  i could understood, all tables were empty had only 5 people in that big restaurant but still they are so cheap.. I just walked out . There must be bad food too..because of these rude people..<//review>

I decided to go here after hearing great reviews from many of my folks. Unfortunately, I should say it wasn't my day. Went here on a Friday night and it was very crowded (probably the reason tht wait time and food went for a toss). Ordered food and waited for more  than an hour. Finally when the food arrived, people who visited earlier were unhappy.< /review>

<review>The biryani was the best of the best I’ve eaten in a while. The nihari and the korma were good too but the chicken biryani truly stood out above the rest. Also, the chai is complementary. Any place with complementary chai has my respect.</review>< date>

I have very bad experience with shalimar today. When I complained about their quality lamb and goat they said you are the first person who is complaining.  Well I had experience with them before as well take away lamb biryani and butter chicken which was very good.  That's why I thought I should go again..but it was too disappointing..the butter chicken was very bad. Ambience was good better than typical.dessi place.
But I will never go again.</Review>

<Review>The Shalimars are following me. I moved from SF to Midtown, then the Shalimar opened in Natomas. I moved from Midtown to Citrus Heights, and a Shalimar opened in Folsom. Always 15 minutes away - watching  and blessing me with the damn best curry money can buy.</Review><rate>5<//rate>< time>

<review>This is the the newest of Shalimar locations. They have a friendly staff. Their Biryani, Beef Nihari, brain masala, chicken tikka, seekh kabab, naan, and tea all are delicious.

Very clean and much improved ambience compared to all the other shalimar in NorCal. Food was really good, moderately spiced, served in a very timely manner, great service. On the downside the quality of meat in the Nihari was not the best, which was unusual.<//text>

I am going to hold my opinion till I have had a chance to try it a few more times. So far its been ok. I am a huge fan of the Shalimar in Freemont and unfortunately I have yet to find similar food .<//Review>

Good time! Excellent haircut and Vern is the best. Lots of great stylists and a pretty good deal for the experience. Suggest giving it a shot for your next hair cut!<//text>

There were three people working, an older gentlemen, a girl with purple hair and another lady. Not one person greeted me but I figured they were just busy. I signed in, sat down and waited. 35 minutes pass, one of the girls came over and spoke to the two other patrons waiting and still never acknowledged my presence.. I’m really not even sure why! I brought my son here because I thought he would like to get his haircut in the little race car seat they have.< /review>< Pics>

I've only been coming here for a short time now..but,I love this place..lisa is the person who usually cuts my hair because she was the first person to do a great job..I do request her when making an appointment..but I would actually trust anyone of the girls to cut my hair..<//Text>

This place is great, just explain exactly what you want and don't "assume".... Unlike other negative posts. Get real, it's a quick hair cut, not a Solon. Lol< /Review>

Rene and the rest of the staff were very accommodating, cordial, and understanding. They will work with you to appraise the actual value and, in my case, made an exception which helped me tremendously. They have earned their awards for a few excellent reasons. You receive professionalism, music, a warm and inviting environment, and the sense that you will receive the best they can offer. They also are aware they are one of if not the best pawn shops in San Diego while remaining humble and service-oriented. With their convenient location, efficient processing, and genuine interest in providing exceptional service, you cannot go wrong with them. I feel once again I must emphasize that Rene was willing and able to make an exception and offer to purchase my device at very competitive pricing. This is where you need to go for your pawn needs. You don't want to sleep on their excellence.</Text>

Shoutout to Abby in helping me sell my gold chain today! Unfortunately rent was due today and I don’t get paid until the last week of March :( so I had to sell my chain to cover that cost! However I’m still great full for the wonderful customer service, and I could always work harder for another piece of jewelry eventually.  But for now thank you cashco encanto! Today actually helped ease my worries about rent! Again thank you again Abby I will be coming back again one day when time allows me to.< /review>

<review>I must write this review about Cashco Pawn Shop. These are some of the most professional individuals you'll ever come in contact with. All the guys & gals are super knowledgeable about the products. They are very patient and actually do give you however much time you need to complete whatever transactions you have to handle. For me all the employees at Cashco are like family to me. I appreciate each and every one of them wholeheartedly. If you ever need some cash cause you're running low on funds, or your looking to buy some gently used jewelry or merchandise then this is your go to place. You definitely won't regret it. Thank you Cashco for many, many amazing years. You guys are the 💣< /review>< pics>

I'm a customer to the PawnShop because they have always treated me like a valued customer. Sometimes I come in to pawn in some items to get money to last me until I get paid again. Last time I came in, a rep name Abby Morton assisted me. She greeted me as soon as I stepped in the door and assisted me right away. She was able to help me to get what I needed. And they always wrap the items so it wont get damaged.<//text>

<text>Imperial Avenue Store Mgr, Leon was very helpful. This was my 1st visit to his store. From my 1st phone call prior to walking into his store & after all transactions were concluded, Leo walked me to my car & waited until I was safely locked inside. Now that's Customer Service!!  To top it off, I was very satisfied with the business services received! Thank you Leon!!

I had a brand new s9 galaxy plus in perfect condition and paid off. They offered me 150 for it. The man that I spoke to was not helpful at all and told me they had to make their money too. From the reviews I expected better, but this was just poor service. Went to another place and the gave me $300. Will never go to this place again.<//text>

Omg, Abby was so helpful! I came in without really knowing what I was looking for and she help me pick just what I needed, with an infectious smile at that! On top of that, she helped me take it to my car, I didn’t even know they would/could do that, super amazing.< /review>

I love this pawn shop and all of its great deals. I will never pay retail price again because I am going to purchase all of my precious items from cash co. I have gotten some amazing deals. If you are in the area stop by and save. Ask for Abby she is amazingly kind and very helpful and always try’s her hardest to get her customers the best savings. I love Cash co.</Review>

What I like about this place is as soon as I entered they greeted me &  was helped by Abby! She is very  friendly & tries to get the cash that you need or at least close to it.. but she shows concern in wanting to help you!  She made me feel very comfortable being my 1st.time.. I would go back to the same place if I needed a loan, & now that I have her buis.card well IllI ask for her service ! Thank .Abby keep up the great attitude!< /text>

I usually get very weary about pawn shops, a friend introduced me to Cashco on imperial and I dealt with Deedee both times and I was very very happy with the service. She was honest and fair and this I say with conviction because I have had horrible and rude experiences with every other place I visited in and around San Diego. If you need anything from a pawn to selling something you don't want anymore, go see Dee Dee at CashCo. U won't go anywhere else after that, trust me.< /text>

< Review>
I had never had to pawn anything before mainly because I never had anything of value. Plus the idea of having to 'pawn' anything wasn't in my vocabulary.  But life put me in dire straights recently and needed some cash FAST! I had 32" flat screen tv and a laptop that I never used that I never used and looked online to find the best place to pawn these items. I went to the Imperial Ave Cashco and spoke to Hector who said he couldn't give me much for the 32" tv and just a few more dollars for the laptop. But not deterred I told him I had a 40" smart tv and he said to bring it in. 2days later  with the clock ticking, I brought the 40" in and forgot the tv stand which they said they couldn't take the tv without it. But,  something touched Hector's and the mngr Leon's heart (God maybe?) and they gave me a small cash advance and told me if I could bring the stand before 7 pm they could give me the rest. I was there at 6:45 and they kept their word and gave me a good loan amount for my  beloved 40" smart tv. I thank God above for Hector, Leon and Rebecca who assisted with the final transaction for being the pawn shop with a HEART!  If anyone ever asks me if I know a good pawn shop, I will tell them CASHCO!!!<//Review>

<Text>I love Target in Del Sur. The store ambiance is great and it's also super clean. They have a good selection of homegoods, girls' clothing (not so good for boys), bikini, beauty products (new upcoming brands). The fresh food section is terrible. Nothing looks fresh. My other major downer is the way Target announce their deals. You have to use your Target cartwheel app and scan the products to see if its on sale or not. Like if it was a game. When I go to the store. It's because I don't want to be on my screen shopping online for deals. So if something is on sale, please just put a sign On Sale by the products. I deeply hate the Cartwheel things... No fun. Not cool.</Text>< Rating>

I usually love this store. But it's the only Target I've ever seen have only THREE checkout stands open during peak hours... Really??<//Review>

I called and was giving the exact inventory and price of a sale item to be able to pick it up 30 min later. She answered the phone quickly and there was no waiting. The store was clean and organized and the greeter told me where the men's dept. was so it was very efficient :)</text>

They are really bad with answering their phone. I called three times to talk to the guest service department and waited thinking someone will answer the phone. Every time the phone rang until it got disconnected and no one answered the phone. That is not considered good customer service.</review>

Employee is a bit rude when it comes to an honest mistake. When I got here, apparently even though there are 20 check out lines, there is actually ONE centralize line that you need to go to which is in the middle of the store. Around 8pm, I got a Gatorade and saw an opening in fast self-check out. I thought cool and I waited in the line for 20 seconds until one of the scanners are available. As I was paying my Gatorade, some employee started yelling at me "Sir, you need to wait in the line instead of cutting." Apparently, even though there are multiple checkout lines, there is only ONE line in the center of the store, which is literally 30 feet away from the actual check out line I'm at. I'm not sure who thought of this system but it's pretty illogical. I'm thinking, I do not mind waiting, but having this universal line in the middle of the store can cause confusion. But the lady keep insisting that "You need to wait next time. You need to wait." Her tone kinda bothers me like she's making it seems like I am cutting when in reality this universal ONE line that is located literally 30 feet away from the check out can be confusing and mistakes will prone to happen. I think it would be probably better if this employee just help out on one of the cash registers instead of playing LINE SIMULATOR with 5 people in the store.< /Review>

I love this target! A woman named Debbie at guest services not only helped me with my return but she also explained how I can use the target app to make returns without my card or receipt!

<Text>So here I am, in Target, trying to buy decorative pillows and blankets for a house showing. Their website says they have all 8 items in stock, but they aren't eligible for online ordering. So I drive 40 minutes out here to get them, but they're not here. According to their magic devices, they don't have out front or in back, but they have some of each item "on hand." Also, according to them, you "can't trust what the website says." And next time, call the store so they verify the stock.  Seems like a great reason to track in in your site, but sure, I'll call.</Text><userid>105210939099553566952<//userid><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< user_name>

I went there for dinner last night worst mistake of my life. I was sitting at the table for an hour and 9 minutes and no one came to to take my order so I asked one of the employees who then told me to give him some SCOOBY Snacks and he was reaking of lemon flavor juul that’s like the worst flavor. I then went to the supervisor who told me he was to busy watching James Charles makeup tutorial. Horrible service my table was still even dirty from the last person. Finally someone came to take my order but he was obviously on cocaine and he was screaming at me saying something about Ariana Grande. Never coming to eat here again one star.</text>

<Review>Did a curb-side (actually parking lot) pickup last night. The whole process from order to pickup was so easy and quick. Target employee loaded the bag in our car trunk.

Not a bad location. Store is big, and parking is easy.  They have drive up service as well.
Store is usually very clean and well kept.  Staff are friendly.
It even has an optical shop along with CVS and Starbucks inside.< /review>

This location never lets me down.  I live in Escondido and this is my Target of choice, absolutely love this variety and there is always more than one open register not like the ones here in Escondido. Target is always a easy and pleasing trip for me and my children :-)<//text>

Never thought about taking optical exam and buy glasses at Target. Turn out it is the right choice. Wait only 45 min for walk-in visit. Price is very reasonable and good selection of glasses. Will come back next year.</Text>

Have you ever been to a Target in which employees politely ask you if they can help you find anything? This is that place. They go above and beyond in customer service! Heck, they even have clean restrooms. The place is super clean and they have a great selection. Only negative thing I could say is that their dollar spot is a little unorganized BUT, it makes hunting for stuff so much more exciting!<//text>

Great shopping center with plenty of parking.  This is a very spacious Target, so it never feels crowded.  Plenty of check out lines, but not very many self-checkout lanes (if they expanded that section, it would be perfect)< /Review>

<text>Zach in the tech dept of this store deserves high praise.  He was so calm, efficient, kind and thorough.  It was so much better of an experience buying two i phones from him than from a verizon store.  He took the time to go over everything and even downloaded an app and transferred all my info for me, including pics and videos.  Kudos to Zach!</text><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I love Target.   Not happy that my purchase the clerk did not look at the tag and charged me for two items and they were supposed to be two items and one price.   So I was charged an extra $3.00 for the items.  It was a 2 count small storage bin in the dollar section.  They were actually clipped together and had to be cut apart.   Love the item just do not love that I was charged twice.   Make sure you check your receipts.   Bought it in California and I live in Ohio so I guess I am out $3.00.<//text>

LONG LINES and clerks are selling people on Target credit cards and downloading apps?   The constant red card push is annoying, but ESPECIALLY when there are long lines, there is ONE clerk checking out,  it is 10:30 at night, and the self checkout was closed.

If a person says YES to a card (none of them did)....have them take the basket over to customer service and complete it there.  Have someone AVAILABLE at customer service just for that.

Also, don't know what's up with blueberries, but for months every time I look for them there weren't any.

On the positive side the store design and infrastructure is great...cleaner than any store I've been in.   But it is light on inventory compared to other Targets.<//review>

If you coupon shop. Don't shop at this target. Most incompetent boss Lady. I heard effective listening pays off. Bree (boss lady) you did not listen to me. You wanted yo keep arguing with me after I told you the correct information the first time. Then you continued on about how it wasn't the right receipt and I kept telling you it was. Yo find out it was the correct receipt the 1st time I told you. You probably should review your store coupon policies before you argue the wrong information. Effective listening works wonders.<//Review>

<Text>Easy to find things with the app, in and out in 5 mins. Did have one issue: price in store for a forehead thermometer was $20 higher than what the app said. The associate adjusted without any grief but bewildering why there would be a $20 price difference on a $35 item, something that can be ordered with in-store pick up on the spot vs store list price.</Text><Rate>4<//Rate>< GmapID>

Pretty new place in Del Mar / 4s Ranch area. This complex is located near to Design 39 School.

On Target:
The store is very clean (because it's brand-new)
Nice location, especially for people around here, there is no Walmart or Target around

Missing Target:
Every clerk I asked for help to find products didn't know where they were. (because it's brand-new)< /Text>

I almost never think of this target since it's relatively new, but it's great when I do! The parking lot is much easier to navigate than the parking lot for the target at the north county mall. Other than that, it's a pretty standard target - big selection, helpful staff, good prices.< /Text>

All around discount store. I shop their regularly, have electronics, food, sundries at good prices. Not sure compared to Wall Mart which is further from my house. It's like the old Kmarts with groceries. Fair prices on groceries.</text>

This store is very clean and has a lot better selection than many of the other Targets I've been to. As an added bonus they are located in an up and coming neighborhood so not as busy as some of the other locations.</text>

As far as Targets go, this is a great one. It's new, has groceries, and a pharmacy. Parking is easy and it doesn't get too crowded or long lines at checkout. The Targetians (the employees)  have always been great. Mongo say "Target good".< /Text>

This is a new Target it opened at the end of 2015.  It has a cvs pharmacy, optical center and groceries.  It has self checkout, which I like. Overall it is a great store and parking is easy.</text>

The cashiers are very nice and welcoming. Security on the other hand make me feel very uncomfortable. Following me around the store as if im doing something wrong! Jered one of the security members is very rude and disrespectful.</Text>

<Text>Still no honest half and half tea (lemon/, tea), still no ear plugs, still no ocean spray tropical cranberry juice in the carton on the shelves.

Don't they reorder what they're out of???

<review>I actually really like this Target, but 2 stars is for all the middle school kids they let run around the store when school gets out. If they're not shopping, kick them out!

<text>They have really fresh seafood here, we got the Fisherman's bounty with garlic butter sauce and it smelled very buttery which I love. A huge bonus is they cut open the king crab legs so we didn't have to cut them like when we get crabs from other places but just enjoy them. One side note, Google map doesn't show the correct place, just look for Island Pacific supermarket, Crab Mentality is inside.< /text><gmapID>0x80c28887c2a75db7:0xb3b4b59a8baee222</gmapID><time>1607221404881<//time>< Pictures>

Delicious shrimp and flavorful sauce! Ranks up there with Boiling crab, maybe even tastier. The for comes in a bag in a ton container. Excellent service too.<//Text>

<review>I celebrated my PhD last night in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that we had a fabulous evening and the place was absolutely one of the reasons for the outstanding meeting. The crew  cooperated in a lovely way, the cuisine was extremely good and my guests were extremely  glad. We shall surely visit again for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c28887c2a75db7:0xb3b4b59a8baee222<//Gmap_id>< userid>

<review>I called to ask if they were serving for dine in. She said there was a 30 minute wait. When I got there, no dine in service. Tried to order for to go but they just stood there with their backs turned. Crab looked old, we left.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>109769975946166998788<//user_id><time>1621223459147< /time>< Rate>

People are funny with their reviews and obviously don't know enough about this type of eatery.  1st you eat with your hands and it's messy 2nd the place is small...you order your food, it comes and you eat...poor service, please.  There are places that do it better, but not in Santa Clarita.</text>

Simply the most amazing crab/potato/sausage combo pot around. The spice makes it. (Order it with mild sauce). Pricey, but can you put a price on perfection?</review>

If you're in, or passing through, Canyon Country and you're looking for a quick meal that's not the typical fast food then stop by here. Have eaten here several times now and the entire experience from the service to the food has been very good. A popular meal is  the fish and chips with Cajun fries. They never disappoint.</text>

Great place for a cajun style crab boil with all the fixin's. Reasonable prices and food made to order. Highly recommended if you have no aversions to getting your hands dirty on some good food!< /review>

Isn't our first time but definitely sealed the deal. Not going to visit or order from here again. Prices are high. Shrimp is lower quality and quantity than that of similar places. Not bad but not worth the money.<//Text>

I've lived in Santa Clarita for most of my life and I would always say: "Man, I wish we had a place in town that knew how to do crab the right way."

MY WAIT IS OVER!

This place warmed me to my core with how delicious the crab is and how absolutely killer the staff was. Seriously, if you love seafood and have been sick of the wimpy crab you get at Red Lobster... THIS. IS. THE. PLACE!

CrabMentality gained a lifelong customer! Keep it up, guys! See you soon (tonight)!</Review>

One of the better bowls of noodles you'll have in the US. Issue is the waitlist. 5 stars for food but 3 stars for waitlist.

It'll tell you to arrive at a certain time it you won't sit for 40 mins later. But if you show up after the target time, they'll cut you from the list.</review>

<Text>This is my second time eating here. The first service was bad and food was good. This time, service was great and food also tasted great. A few hours later, everything came back up for me and a few others. I had mussels and king crab. One person only had crabs. It's enough of an upset to not warrant a 3rd trip back.<//Text><rating>2< /rating>< Name>

Describe this place in 3 words: greasy, salty, and cold.

Initially, we sat in an area that was really cold, so we moved. The other spot  we moved to was very cold as well.  I guess one can't ask too much from a restaurant inside a gracery store. Anyhow, the food arrived. The presentation was good and the food was looking nice. We started eating. The food was very greasy and too salty. The crab was ok though. The chicken tenders were bland. The crab rice was ok, but way to greasy.  Although the food was edible, I probably won't be coming here in the winter time, or until the place gets some sort of heater. If I had to describe this place in 3 words: greasy, salty, and cold.</text>

$$$ but tasty and portions are just right. They have a godly mushroom appetizer that really just tastes like crispy bacon but at $15 it's still a hard pill to swallow. Yes, it's all vegan. Make reservation or get there early. The staff are active as they are busy so kinda know your order so you don't waste anytime.< /Text>

< Review>
LOVE THIS PLACE! If you like juices they have a JUICE FLIGHT so you can try all the flavors and figure out what you like best. Some of my friends might comment this is a vegetarian restaurant but get the pizza! It's about the fantastic vibes this place has, and honestly the portions are large enough for me to share with someone else. My vegan Mom got the Black Bean Burger and it came with A LOT of potato wedges which were delicious. I got the breakfast burrito, but I honestly would recommend something else because it was pretty basic, but large portions.
They have postcards that they can mail out for you, you just have to ask for it. If you're bent on coming here make a reservation because it looks busy every time I pass by. We were able to walk up on the weekday no problem though. The bar here looks huge too.
I would definitely recommend for a light bite and great atmosphere.<//Review>

We were right - the immunity juice was perfection. I also got the immunity salad and it was pretty good. Small servings overall, not a huge fan of the crunchy chickpeas. Service was good, kind staff. The decorations were super cute. Very Abbot Kinney, somehow simultaneously high brow and down to earth. Not crazy expensive either.

Mango Lassi smoothie was rather chewy which was unexpected, but refreshing flavor. Brazilian Blast smoothie was great, too.

Cozy little corner spot - there’s lots of seating options both indoor and outdoor.</Text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Really cute place with great food. I went here for dinner with a friend several weeks ago and brunch with some friends this weekend. This weekend we showed up with a party of 5 around 11:20AM and to our surprise thy were able to seat us without us having a reservation which was really nice!

My first visit to The Butcher’s Daughter, I got the Pad Thai. It wasn’t my favorite Pad Thai I’ve ever gotten just because it is very tangy. My friend got the Pad Thai for brunch yesterday and she enjoyed it but was unable to finish it because it is so rich.

Yesterday I got the poppyseed waffles and highly recommend them! Especially for being a gluten free dish, the waffle was so delicious and fluffy.

This place has great friendly staff and a good ambiance. When indoor dining opens back up, their indoor area is very cute as well with tons and tons of natural lighting that makes it especially beautiful.< /review><name>Cassie Vokes< /name><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1615811832621<//time><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVNbs9x_kBXi1nVgzYSwS88rBechCqN9SD8QHZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdHcAzz1w-pd9kLEM8umCJ-2sbtUbad1O6NQgE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp8Iadie9nuAhMHGzto9YotukH2TgnP7ktaB-B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXgY4N9IXlWOfXOA6ARZPW_ZsrwTAfIPtFulfb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLopV4wm3O83LokUQPYv-oK2ZavYU19Yt9HIDd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record>

<time>1618186179760< /time><rating>4<//rating><review>A little pricey but delicious food. If you’re vegan make sure you pay attention to the menu as it is a vegetarian restaurant by default for the most part. Reservations are recommended. Cute spots out side and inside.

I had the mushroom calamari, coffee, BLT and Farmer in Heels with no mayo and vegan mozzarella. Soy bacon was delicious. Mushroom calamari is a MUST. Farmer in Heels was good but I’m glad it comes in a small cocktail glass. The amount of basil makes it a hard drink to have more than 6oz of.

It’s Venice so parking is mostly a nightmare. On the backside of Abbot Kinney Blvd there is free parking lots, just gotta find a spot.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHFSY02IeofI9zkkJTDN0xmitv5GHcahaO3G2t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvNYzickOKs2zMXT4KmGtEDECuF8U4zmoTp9Yw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

We went for brunch, as well as for dinner! Forgot to take photos but both the surfer's burrito, the coffees, the smoothies, as well as the hummus, mushroom calamari, and spicy pizza were all to die for! Friendly staff and cute location that are a short walk from the beachfront.

I'm rarely one to gush so much over a place but this is one pit stop well worth the visit whether for morning eats or dinner.</review>

Fantastic food. Açai bowl was one of the best I’ve ever had. Avocado toast was as good as I’d hoped it might be. Flight of juices had some really delicious flavors in it.</review>

My breakfast sandwich was great! Hubs enjoyed the Benedict. My friend didn't quite enjoy her pizza but my only complaint was when we ordered to go, we weren't given any forks/spoons. We didn't know until we went to grub. So I couldn't eat the yogurt and hubs bought a plastic spoon from a fruit cart man.<//review>

Friendly staff. Cocktails are well crafted. Food is consistently good but the menu can be a little limited and can err on the pricier side. Although the chessboard is a regular pick for myself. I would recommend for vegetarians (like myself) but think the ambience is best for brunch/lunch.<//Review>

<Text>We were greeted nicely, it took a minute for someone to take our order, we went looking for someone. We tried the hummus white bean, spicy kale salad and the dolce picante pizza. Very delicious. Very cuisine ish.

We had to look for someone to ask for another drink. Lol. But the check that was presented to us we didn't have to go searching for help. Ha ha ha .
The ambiance was amazing. You should definitely try. For the most part I really enjoyed my time there.

Everything is all vegetarian here..
so delicious ☺️✨
The egg avo and soyrizo omelet was alright, I felt like it needed some tang or spice. Maybe some bell peppers. The sauce they gave me was too spicy for me.

The poppy seed waffle was tasty! Nice and thick, Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. With some creamy cream on top. This was not too sweet, it was just right. More fruit plzzzz :D

The breakfast sandwich was a bit dry.  I took a bite and it scratched the back of my throat since it’s so dry.
Definitely needs some jelly or some secret special sauce. I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Their fresh juices always make my tummy really happy 🥰</Text>

The ladies provided wonderful service! Unfortunately the food was a different experience. The Mushroom pizza and the Pad Thai lacked flavor balancing. Even sourdough bread slices with an herb butter lacked flavor.

The IPA beer and the Pineapple Jicama juice were amazing along with deserts.

It was a disappointment and even when we got the bill for $80, WOW!< /Text>

I wouldn’t normally eat at a vegetarian restaurant but their menu items sounded good. Wasn’t disappointed in the quality of food or service but was a bit overpriced. Would recommend if your wanting to try something different.</Text>

<Review>Really unique and aesthetic vegetarian restaurant with plenty of food options and great variety of drinks! Exceptional service with accommodating, caring staff members added to the experience as well. I would highly recommend trying the mixed mushroom pizza!

It gets busy so definitely recommend making a reservation before hand but it's also a great area to walk around before or after eating. Parking is sometimes hard to find but I've found more spots on one of the side streets off of Abbot Kinney Boulevard.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

Pleasantly surprised by the good service. TBD is always busy in Abbott Kinney, but we waited just 15 mins with a toddler and dog. The food is average vegan fare. The country breakfast is pretty good with the impossible sausage being DELICIOUS. Good pad thai, but the crispy artichokes were decent. The spring recharge bowl lacked seasoning but had nice ingredients.< /review>

<text>I don’t frequent vegetarian restaurants, but The Butcher’s Daughter has managed to get my attention for all the right reasons and has lassoed me twice. Above all, it has seriously good food prepared and served by a staff that is friendly and welcoming. In addition, its Venice location and ambiance are quintessentially L.A. which makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for us Angelinos who live here by choice and not necessity.

My most recent visit was on Friday, March 12, 2021, which by coincidence was a cold, drizzling day that was freezing by Southern California standards.  Due to the coronavirus, only outdoor seating was available, but fortunately the establishment provided propane patio heaters which made the overall experience pleasant until it was time to leave and face the elements once again. Speaking of the coronavirus and its role in our lives as the “new normal,” it was obvious that The Butcher’s Daughter takes the issue seriously by putting house rules in place to ensure the safety of its guests and staff. Many of its rules aren’t rules as much as they are courteous measures like offering single use menus and touchless payments to ease the worries of its patrons.  What was most impressive was that the staff was able to convey smiles hidden behind their masks through warm gestures of kindness and friendly small talk.  I felt that the staff genuinely cared about the quality of their products and  guest satisfaction.

On the last visit, my lunch date and I started by sharing the White Bean Hummus which would please even the most picky of hummus connoisseurs.  Served with grilled flatbread, the hummus is enhanced with grilled artichoke along with kalamata and castelvetrano olives making it impossible to eat slowly.  I hope I didn’t blow my chance for a second date by devouring more than my fair share of it.  For the main course, I had the Mixed Mushroom Pizza with a Golden Ale and my date had the Coconut Curry Bowl and a Spicy Mezcalita to drink.  Of course I only have good things to say about my pizza which was a thin crusted pie with a variety of mushrooms, hence the name, on mozzarella with garlic confit and white truffle oil.  Those ingredients by themselves are tasty, but when topped with arugula, the flavors bursted to life with a favorable impression.  The Golden Ale, made by Athletic Brewing Company, is by far one of the best non alcoholic beers on the market (I was the designated driver) and really added the final touch to my meal.  However, my date’s lunch, the Coconut Curry Bowl, was nothing less than sensational. He let me have a few spoonfuls of his curry although I’m sure he was probably taking precautions to make sure I didn’t eat it all like I practically did with the hummus. It was a rich combination of chickpeas, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, and French curry known as vadouvan.  Served with grilled flatbread, that curry was out of this world! Like I said, I enjoyed my pizza, but was definitely jealous of my date’s choice.  I didn’t try his Mezcalita, but he seemed to like it a great deal and I'm sure any mezcal lover would enjoy it as well.

The Butcher’s Daughter is so much more than a trendy, plant based restaurant.  It is a genuinely sweet and charming little eatery that could satisfy and please even the most aggressive of carnivorous appetites like mine.  Definitely a place you would visit more than once and a perfect spot to take out of town guests.  Absolutely wonderful!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJeQiG2gmADpw4TQ02HvjfNGkG25y42HsJc3kw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtqjmOnsFXZSeWNBpODrPz31V4CNuh2NoLwQYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I'm no vegetarian...and wasn't trying to eat healthy....we stopped because the food looked good as we walked by...I was hungry, I was tired of the sun's glare...and they had plenty of room for the only option (outdoor dining). Nice shade and space to make you feel like you're social distancing.

Margherita Pizza and Avocado Toast. Fresh, toasty and tasty.</Review>

Ordered through doordash only got delivered one thing we ordered. Called because HALF our order was missing. A whole margarita pizza that we were charged $18.00 for. The guy said we would have to COME PICK it UP?! What. We’re from out of town that’s why we ordered delivery in the first place. The coconut curry we did get was gross, zero flavor and way overpriced. Long and short or our experience. We spent $60.64 for a small bowl of $16.00 coconut curry that we ended up throwing out and ordered a pizza. Completely and total waste of money. Beware!!</text>

I am obsessed with her spicy Cesar kale salad. I visited today to pick up my salad and I advised Rafael that the dressing was not in my order last time. He quickly apologized and made my experience very pleasant. I definitely will be coming back !</review>

This is the best vegan/vegetarian food I have had in my life! The staff is very knowledgeable about their menu, so any questions I had were answered with no problem. The impossible burger and fries had so much flavor, I did not want to stop eating even though I was so full! I wish we could have eaten inside, but COVID policy wouldn’t allow that, so we were able to eat in their outdoor area.</Text>

Amazing place for having breakfast, lunch or brunch. Their juices are so delicious. The decor is far from traditional and it just gives you good vibes. Staff is very friendly. Everyone looks more modern that you don't worry don't take it personal, everyone goes there to enjoy food.<//Review>

Flavourful drinks and amazingly tasteful vegetarian dishes. I have to recommend this restaurant as all went perfectly on our visit. As mentioned food and drinks were perfect but staff and service was quick and friendly. A+ job! Cheers!< /Review>

<Review>Excellent, bright setting for brunch. Adventurous cocktails and food. But high on the price. This is a place that you have to weigh paying for a setting and food that’s healthy, made the right way but just going to get the job done on flavor. The breakfast sandwich for example was good but just that: a breakfast sandwich. One you can find everywhere. Not better but also no worse. However, the mushroom pizza was the highlight of this meal. Like everything, overpriced. But I was happy to partake. And the seasonal mimosa was just what I needed... when I got it. But loved the concept on the traditional brunch drink. Would recommend. But this isn’t a usual routine kind of spot. Not warranting the value.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0AVq3RanhsEbN1F3-a-M2ZvGYw_A3KFUWN93W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df</gmapID></record>

<Text>Nice café with vegetarian menu and vegan options. Sometimes they are very busy and I need to wait up to 30 minutes. The food mostly good, but a had bad experience too. They are out of some ingredients or dishes sometimes.
It’s a good place for a group of people or couple.<//Text>< pics>

Friendly service in a relaxed and homey atmosphere. The surfer's breakfast as a bowl was an excellent way to begin the day. Made with farm fresh eggs, black beans, hashbrowns, and fresh avocados. Drip coffee was robust. There is indoor and outdoor seating.</text>

One of the best (if not the best) bunch and lunch spots on Abbott. It’s about $35-40 per person with entree and a juice/latte + tax and tip. You’ll be glad you tried it. The line on the weekend could be scary but rest assured they keep it moving along. Highly recommend the Matcha Latte with the pizza!</Review>

We were visiting Santa Monica from Colorado and a friend suggested this place it’s a few minutes away. It was the first time my husband and I tried vegetarian food and honestly we were surprised. The maple “sausage” tasted like actual sausage and everything else was really good too. We had reservations and were sat down fairly quickly the waiter however didn’t seem too interested in being at work. He wasn’t that friendly. Overall it’s a cool little hip spot.</text>

A trendy, upscale, all vegetarian restaurant. The ambiance was nice (the wooden benches not so comfortable). We had the mac & cheese and the mushroom pizza.  Both were really good.  We arrived at 7:50 PM on a Wednesday in the fall and still had to wait for a table.   It is in a trendy part of Venice so very difficult to find parking near by.<//Text>

<text>Ordered through doordash only got delivered one thing we ordered. Called because HALF our order was missing. A whole margarita pizza that we were charged $18.00 for. The guy said we would have to COME PICK it UP?! What. We’re from out of town that’s why we ordered delivery in the first place. The coconut curry we did get was gross, zero flavor and way overpriced. Long and short or our experience. We spent $60.64 for a small bowl of $16.00 coconut curry that we ended up throwing out and ordered a pizza. Completely and total waste of money.

<Review>I live abt 4 houses away so been here, ohhh more than a few times 😜 Consistent, vibey always when busy, and clean/cozy. Great staff (except the poor door girl who constantly seems a bit clueless to seat 3-4x a week regulars when it's not that busy asap). If you haven't been get the tumeric latte to start your morning with the full breakfast. Also great at dinner but they're spread out now and it makes nice COVID safe, yet busy, dining. Def go here! Also the owner has a popup across the way, equally a cool place when it's going on.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df< /gmapID></record>

Great vegan burger using the Impossible Burger and decent vegan margherita pizza. Burger was definitely the star of the show because I'm not a huge fan of vegan cheese. The dough and crust on the pizza was crispy and delicious! The place was busy but service was top notch!< /Text>

<review>The hostesses were nice and we got a table at their outdoor dining area pretty quickly. The food came quickly as well but was mediocre at best. The impossible burger was good but the potato wedges were dry and not crispy at all. We got the vegan Margherita pizza but it was loaded up with vegan cheese and hardly any sauce which made it taste dry and just.. not good. Don't believe the hype. I understand its covid and they are doing their best to accommodate so one of the three stars is for participation. Overall pretty disappointing.< /review>< Time>

We came here quite a few times during our stay in Los Angeles. The vegan food here was incredible. They also did some great tasty smoothies too. Staff were also very welcoming and friendly. Would highly recommend if you're in the area!<//review>

<Review>I had the smoothie bowl and it was so good however it gives you a lot of brain freeze (because it tastes so good and don't want to take breaks in between each bite). The juices were amazing. They were refreshing and although the combinations sounded interesting it all worked amazing with each other.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Whoa is the butcher whose daughter launches a vegetarian restaurant…but for the rest of us vegetarians, we salute her branching out on her own path. We had a great experience at The Butcher’s Daughter restaurant in Venice. The restaurant had been on our radar for a while since we almost had brunch there a couple of months back, and decided to give it a try when the wait at another nearby restaurant was too long. We were seated right away on a Saturday night.

I started with a Rosemary’s Cup cocktail which was very refreshing and a tiny bit sweet with muddled cucumber and big pieces of fresh rosemary sticking out of it. Very well done.

My wife and I split the butternut squash risotto which was perfect as the split portions were large and the dish was rich so the full serving would have been too much for one of us. This dish had lots of flavor with a little bit of an Indian spice to it. This was a very nice take on butternut squash risotto.

We also shared the rainbow carrots – A sweet dish full of multicolored carrots that would have been too sweet to eat on its own but perfect when shared.

I saw vegan sausage on the menu that normally comes as an add-on with the cheese board and asked if I could try that thinking it would be a good salty companion to the risotto. The flavor (white bean and fennel) was good although the texture wasn’t perfect for a faux meat.

We also got the Kale chips which was quite an experience top with a vegan parmesan Parmesan topped with lime. My wife was in love with this dish.

Although we didn’t order it, the veggie burger that walked by (okay, technically it was being carried by a human) looked amazing.

There were plenty of other things on the menu we didn’t get but would have loved to try, including desserts. We’ll definitely be back.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM13NmTiA8o1DWOBNRTmNcfErMQk2PaVUCCb63u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMu9pQn2V1xJWbdGbkAETAZI1kDf93Ilm-XSb34=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnDwVq8xCyfHDI9ne_E2LiJL1zcFnZS41k_B93=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdmDDshUCVregqcQ2T24X5a0PIdQssm7CRla6A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJtw7YUzDTvQac_yTkIr6akVKMacL2ZqWsJ5zt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

I can't recommend this restaurant enough! It's a fully vegetarian restaurant. It's so cute inside without being pretentious at all. The food is stellar. My boyfriend and I ate every last crumb. He had the waffles and I had the egg sandwich. We live out of state, but I will definitely be back when I visit LA again!</Text>

The Butcher's Daughter is a really nice place to enjoy brunch on one of the best streets in LA. I came with a few friends on Mother's Day and we were told that the wait was 1.5 hours, but it only ended up being 30 minutes so not sure how that happened but I'll take it.

The service was really good and was super attentive to our table. Checked in a good amount of times. I had a cold brew with a side of their rosemary simple syrup which was amazing. The syrup smelled like fresh rosemary so you can tell it was real rosemary that they used to make it. My friend and I split the surfers breakfast (breakfast burrito) and the buttermilk pancakes. Both were amazing, but the sizes are a littttttle small for the price. Only reason I'm not giving it a five star, but you can tell the quality was above average.

The place is also vegetarian so the name of the place is pretty comical if you think about it. Very clever. Interior aesthetic is super cute and they have a little patio section as well.<//Text>

I came here for the first time today. It started out as a good experience but slowly went downhill. I had ordered something small to begin and told the waitress I’d wait to order my next item. After I received my first order, I was pretty much ignored for the next 30-40 minutes. Didn’t check on me or anything or see if I wanted to order my next item. After a long time waiting I was able to  flag her down and I ordered something else but I kind of wish I had just left. Very cute atmosphere and the food was decent. Service was lacking. I probably won’t come back.< /Text>

We went for brunch on a Saturday and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. I loved the ambience of the airy restaurant and the staff were friendly. The food was vegetarian and very tasty even for a non vegetarian like myself. It was pricy though. $50 for a brunch won’t be a luxury I will be able to enjoy every weekend.</text>

Very comfortable atmosphere, rockin' music, interesting menu.  I had the cinnamon apple waffle.  It was much too dense, had a mealy/gritty texture and far too much spice in the batter.  A smattering of baked apple chunks, whipped cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon with pure maple syrup.  I managed half.  $14.< /Text>

Yummy pastries! I had no idea what to get so I grabbed myself an egg sandwich and the Farro grain bowl. Worth it! My best friend got a flight of juices and acai bowl and the coconut yogurt<//Text>

We went here for a company dinner and it was a decent place. I had the lamb chops and they were tasty!
Our server was very courteous and took good care of us. The fried cheese was awesome as well as the calamari.
Overall vibe of the place is very cozy.<//text>

Very good place. Upscale vegetarian food, nice selections of wine and great service. The night on our visit there was a DJ playing, that created a good ambiance. We had a lasagna and veg burger. Both dishes were delicious and filling. Prices are very reasonable too.< /review>

<date>1490689617090<//date><Review>Awesome experience! Believe the hype--it's pretty good, but be careful about the time you have. It took about 40 minutes to be seated but there's a variety of cute shops and stores around Venice to visit so the time flies. The service is great and every single waiter seems genuinely happy to be there and very helpful in general. I was pleased by the food and I'll probably be back one day. It's 30% for the aesthetic of the place, 30% the service, 40% for the food!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I got the Butcher's burger and literally threw up 10 times after, including in the middle of my sleep. I don't know what they put into that impossible burger but I will never be coming back again.< /Review>

<review>The food is fabulous in the restaurant and nearly as good when they (Grub Hub) delivers. They are timely in producing orders, often earlier than noted. Their menu is creative and after multiple times eating there or taking out, we still have too many favorites!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>The surfer’s breakfast burrito was excellent but we found the French toast to be too rich and the raspberry butter (though interesting) would have been better replaced with ice cream.
The atmosphere and service were great and I would 10/10 recommend for breakfast.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN80eYew_WiAW_St-dP89AkhFr-BXkEaYctAQkP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBITWkliP6fgZHSWeugIzNyMxOfIazQecg6Lt_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

The Butcher’s Daughter weaves itself seamlessly into the artisanally curated aesthetic that has become the predominant commercial style along Abbot Kinney Boulevard over the past 20 years. The restaurant’s vibe is distinctly upscale, but the rustic bohemian craftsmanship creates an open, inviting atmosphere that encourages clientele to hang out and enjoy the social experience of food, drinks and friends for which they came.

AESTHETIC - Rustic, Light & Vibrant

The 3,200 square foot space radiates with sunshine throughout the day. The entire area is bathed in natural light by 12-foot windows at either end of the restaurant, and - the key ingredient - the 20-foot ceiling that incorporates three pitched skylights among the exposed wooden bow truss beams.

Reminiscent of a well-worn white cotton towel blanketing a cream-colored sandy beach, the color palette chosen for the restaurant is a vital design element that combines with sunlight to create a comfortable, inviting mood. Primary features include a mix of exposed brick (painted white), white ash wood paneling, and tiles set in various shades of neutral. A myriad of secondary design elements - both structural and decorative - frame and give life to the baseline cream-colored palette. These include industrial aluminum light fixtures, visible brass piping, wooden three-blade Aviation ceiling fans, exposed structural steel columns, a variety of dangling green plants, a wooden bar and table tops, a steel hanging rack above the espresso bar adorned with plants and ropes, and artfully constructed, mirror-lined shelves installed behind the cocktail bar.

The open doors and windows at either end of the restaurant facilitate a fresh ocean breeze that flows through the space. This constant, gentle infusion of oxygen enlivens the atmosphere and promotes vibrancy.

PROGRAMMING - Creative & Versatile

That natural, bright space is programmed with six discrete settings:
+ sidewalk patio along Abbot Kinney
+ pastry display with to-go beverages and wine bottles for sale at the entrance
+ u-shaped espresso bar
+ traditional cocktail bar
+ indoor restaurant seating at a combination of booths, 2-tops, 4-tops and family-style share tables
+ outdoor back patio with a family style farm table

The spatial set-up provides customers an array of options to engage the space depending on the experience they seek. Sidewalk patio seating evokes a casual European cafe lifestyle. The entryway to the main dining room - with a to-go coffee bar, selection of pastries, and fully stocked refrigerator for any mood (fresh juice, beer, and wine) - provides patrons a quick in-and-out experience. There are two different bars that cater to distinct beverage inclinations: a traditional high-top bar features beer, wine and creative cocktails, while an intimate espresso bar inspires caffeine-infused consumption in closely-set wooden swivelling stools. Indoor seating throughout the restaurant accommodates any size party in search of a vibrant vibe. The picturesque backyard setting features a prominent wooden farm table and a tiled fireplace in the same motif as the interior. This space bursts with life, enveloping patrons in a variety of verdant hanging succulents, jade, fern, and bamboo, among other greenery.</text>

<text>Wonderful food and fun atmosphere. We had the sample plate and the fig pizza. Both were wonderful. Kid friendly. Great service. Removed one star for menu clarity. They say everything is vegetarian and most are vegan, but it was unclear which were vegan. It is common to have vegan cheese substitutes on menus but it was unclear which items were specifically vegan.<//text>< time>

I finally got around to coming here. It is all the hype, and then some. My boyfriend got the surfer burrito, and I took a bite. Never tasted a burrito quite like that before. They gave us free pastries, apologizing for the wait. I asked the waiter if they were meant for someone else, as we did not wait long. He assured us they were for us! Great food, impeccable service.<//Review>

The best vegetarian restaurant I have ever experienced. We ordered a fresh ravioli and a Pad Thai, both of them were delicious. Also, all the personal we talked were very friendly and helpful (they even helped us to charge the mobile, since we were running out of battery before going to the airport). Evey enjoyable atmosphere. Perfect experience!<//text>

Not only is this place gorgeous with a great spot for people watching along Abbot Kinney, but this place has amazing food as well! The Kale Caesar salad during their happy hour blew me away. I was expecting a pretty standard kale salad but WOW! The harrissa dressing took the salad to a whole other level! Simply amazing. I've been talking about that salad. I've spread naughty rumors about it.

The Butchers Daughter is a trendy spot for a reason - it's amazing as hell. Definitely deserves to be visited!<//text>

Most definitely a highlight on our Californian road trip! The food was flavoursome, diverse and beautifully presented and the service was impeccable! But most noticeable of all was the interior, which is dreamy throughout with a really friendly and relaxed atmosphere.</text>

The food tastes very fresh and healthy.
Really liked the interesting combination of flavors especially for the salads.
I've been here with friends to celebrate a birthday and also with my husband for lunch - we loved all the dishes. Bonus: fresh fruit & veggie juices<//Review>< Pictures>

If you love meat this is not for you, vegan only. But the food tastes fantastic, I got a mushroom pizza an a juice. The place is decorated with plants hanging from the sealing and walls. Looks nice and creates a nice atmosphere.
However, the place is noisy and when you are siting in the middel of the room.  But, I will be back again<//text>

This place truly does not disappoint. The menu is delicious. I particularly enjoy the Reuben and the Moscow Mule. The environment is beautiful too: hanging vines, plentiful seating and the bathrooms are my favorite. I like the rustic pipe look. Clearly, it is a big advantage for this cute brunch spot in the center of it all.<//review>

The food is fabulous in the restaurant and nearly as good when they (Grub Hub) delivers. They are timely in producing orders, often earlier than noted. Their menu is creative and after multiple times eating there or taking out, we still have too many favorites!< /review>

<Name>H J<//Name><date>1582424952295< /date><rate>3<//rate><text>The Butcher’s Daughter is one of those “Abbot Kinney” restaurants you hear about.  But let’s be honest, half of the customer’s waiting in line want to go because of the hype, the other half want to go because of the hype.

I thought there would be more vegan options, but alas. The only upside was the nice interior decor and nice service< /Text>

<review>AMAZING food! I love the atmosphere here. I had a seasonal salad at the bar and the kind women sitting next to me offered me some of their pizza :) I couldn’t say no. That’s was also delicious. The coffee is also very yummy. This place is very trendy and busy but for a good reason.< /review>< user_id>

Amazing place. Great vibe and service. Vegetarian food to have breakfast, brunch or lunch with vegan options. Passion juice, the best egg, pancakes and avocado toasts are good options.<//Review>

The Butcher’s Daughter is one of those “Abbot Kinney” restaurants you hear about.  But let’s be honest, half of the customer’s waiting in line want to go because of the hype, the other half want to go because of the hype.  That is not supposed to make sense, because neither does the formation of a line outside of the restaurant.

At best, the food is mediocre. At worst, you‘re emotionally distraught after having been served a cocktail of unmet expectations, flavorless food, and slow service.< /Review>

The Butchers Daughter is a very Instagram-ready, aesthetically pleasing, Abbot Kinney ‘must visit’ according to most reviews/foodies etc. It is very thoughtfully decorated and has a trendy vibe about it BUT...

As they don’t accept reservations there is often a long wait for seating, particularly on weekends, sometimes in excess of 1hr+. We were lucky to get bar seating for brunch on a Friday, unfortunately the swing around seats aren’t comfortable if you’re planning on having a good catch up with friends/plan on hanging out for awhile.

The service was good, with the hostess on the day being very friendly. There is however a mandatory 3% “wellness tip” before the suggested tips which start at 20%. Absolutely no idea what the wellness tip is for? The service however was not exceptional or deserving of a minimum tip of 23%...I suppose this is an upside to working in an upscale eatery on AK.

The food was good but not as mind blowing as I was expecting. The price for both a pizza and açai bowl were appropriate, particularly for the location. The açai bowl could be a bit more creative. The prices of juices are a bit steep, particularly when the OJ was bitter and the size consists of about 3 gulps.

I’d try The Butchers Daughter again because they’re all vegetarian and have a wide range of vegan items and would recommend for those wishing to give it a go. But if you’re not overly phased and don’t want to wait for seating then there is better nearby! Overall, it felt like a lot of the people visiting were just doing it for Instagram likes.</text>

A lovely spot with indoor/ outdoor seating, instagram-ready decor and good food...The Butcher’s Daughter is always a good bet for brunch, pizzas or just a chat over rose lattes. Located in the heart of one of the must-visit streets of Venice Beach, it’s a good spot to stop and refuel whether you’re shopping, browsing or just being a lazy daisy.<//Text>

Great place to go for vegetarian and vegan food!  Very accommodating for food allergies as well.  The dolce picante pizza is the best thing on the menu, but you can't go wrong with the lasagna or carbonara.<//text>

<Review>WOW WOW WOW!! This restaurant has ruined me for all others!! Amazing food and great service!! I’ve taken carnivores here to eat and they also loved it!! The best vegan restaurant out there and reasonably priced for the excellent quality.  They also have gluten free options! The Surfers breakfast burrito is my hubbys fav and I love the Rueben sandwich! And of course you have to get their juices and famous avocado toast! Toast is super filling so if you are having a separate meal then 2 people can split half an order or 1 slice. I no longer live in MDR but when we are in the Venice area we always eat here!! Hopefully you like this review!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpJ4nqImXWNMPdJqliA0fkXTbhO5zdedSiowOW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Y1ujw265BKutkSt02e01bXQVcn3LhbqYJ1bv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPan-diho_S8lLLqPt1HIyV6ivDYlEoqOIRLCfR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBsZA4yvDhZ2ZdneGowbjt9twHij6yMH-jixb6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

My husband and I came here for brunch without realizing it's a strictly vegetarian/vegan spot. Although we both wish we could have real meat, the dishes we ordered were well made and quite flavorful. The portion sizes were good, but still seemed a bit pricey.</text>

This place has great atmosphere! Cozy, hip, but casual. You can sit at the bar or get a table. Just have coffee or a drink, or have a meal. The menu is all vegetarian and has vegan options as well. We had a really good cheese board.</review>

<Text>Wow, was this place good! I'm a meat eater, so going to a vegetarian restaurant is always a gamble for me. But, this place certainly satisfied me! The food was delicious and the majority of the staff was friendly, especially the two gentleman working the bar. The decor was fantastic and the vibe of the place was mellow and comfortable. I felt the pricing was fair considering the location and quality of ingredients.</Text>< Pictures>

The wait was maybe 5 minutes. The staff was so sweet and smiley. They really welcomed me in. I ordered the best egg sandwich with a side of the chipotle aioli mayo. If i could smother all things in that mayo i would be set. Just loved it all.

EDIT: I also did happy hr there. I got the avocado toast, deviled eggs and arnold palmer. Loved the avo toast and arnold palmer!<//text>

< Review>
It's a solid vegetarian restaurant. However I (omnivore) brought my vegan/gluten-free spouse. She felt there weren't enough options for her, and I thought I was being a mensch by selecting a place she would love. In the end, neither of us were really satisfied. But if I was a vegetarian, who ate eggs, cheese, and bread, I think this place would make me smile.< /Review>

The chai was extra disappointing, but I drink a lot of legit chai. My partner had the Surfer's Breakfast and I had some seasonal tomato thing with eggs. We both needed all the salt and pepper and hot sauce and then just lost interest. Really, really disappointing and based on reviews, we're not sure why. 2 stars for juice and hype, I guess.<//Text>< Pictures>

Beautiful place with a great variety of food. We came there for brunch. The vegetarian and vegan options were good and the sizes too.

The fresh juices were tasty. I had the pancakes which were fluffy and well prepared.</review>

I thought there would be more vegan options, but alas. The only upside was the nice interior decor and nice service<//review>

Great food, nice service with staff who know the menu well. Had the breakfast burrito and was not disappointed. Quite pricey but setting is great and classy.<//Review>

My experience was pretty good. Really cool atmosphere. it’s beautiful!
Their service is kind of slow but they are friendly.. and the food was amazing!! I read the reviews on yelp before we arrived so I knew what to order.
I had the pizza with veggie and the pad Thai.
I will definitely come back.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It must be under new management because I don't understand all the good reviews on here. One of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten at. It was rather embarrassing as I was with a group of 4 and we were served bland, cold and greasy food. The staff wouldn't even bring us water for the table, shunning us for wasting water.... It was rather overpriced and the portions were tiny. $145 dollars for one course the with the group and had to go grab more food afterwards! I would not recommend!</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>All vegetarian brunch and juice spot with vegan options (i.e. vegan cheddar). Everything was fantastic. Had the mixed mushroom and egg pizza, egg sandwich, Benedict, burrito and several juices (#10 pictured here). Service is fast and fabulous.

The space is amazing. Very open air with high ceilings and vibrant light that is warm but not overwhelming. Venice can be cliche but this place executes very well for any place.< /Text>< pics>

It's also a laptop a d tablet free zone so its ideal just to take a break from work, enjoy CA and have some awesome vegan food!<//Review>< pictures>

Food is good. However, two major flaws: service is very slow. And the sweet potato fries were burnt. Drinks are perhaps a bit overpriced - I know everything in Venice is but... it’s a bit overpriced for Venice too. Everything else was good, great attention to detail (cleanliness in the bathroom could be improved though), nice atmosphere and friendly staff.<//text>

The interior is beautiful and had a lot of photo ops (if that's your thing). Despite the busy-ness of the morning rush- our order came out very quickly.

Avocado toast Benedict: Poached farm eggs, 9-grain toast, hollandaise & new potatoes.
From seeing pictures, we decided to go with this. Also... how can you ever go wrong with a Benedict? We were correct! Avocado is my absolute fav & with how fresh it seems to be here in Cali, it perfected this Benedict.

The best egg sandwich: Farm eggs, baby kale, avocado, cheddar & harissa mayo on a toasted classic croissant.
YUM. the harissa mayo with all the other ingredients on a soft but crisp croissant was so perfect to appease our hungry stomachs.

The juice flight (for a great price of $12 is a choice of 4 of their simple or heritage juices).
We tried the following:
- WATER FLOWER: Watermelon, Fennel, Honeydew, Lime & Lavender. Absolutely delicious! This one was my personal favorite. Not too sweet. Loved the flavor of watermelon and lavender.
- HONEY BEE: Grapefruit, Turmeric Root, Yuzu, Honey & Bee Pollen. This was my least favorite. I wasn't a fan of the turmeric and Yuzu.
- PURE PASSION: Passion Fruit, Jicama, Pineapple, Yuzu, Orange & Raspberries. Loved all the fruity flavors of this one.
- GODDESS OF GREEN: Kale, Cucumber, Apple, Fennel & Pineapple. This one tasted like a typical healthy vegan kale drink. The kale was def strong.</text>

The Impossible Burger was great! But the restaurant didn't really add anything to it to warrant the price. ($17ish) Also, the server was rude and threw my card down on the table after she saw my tip even though the options they give you have a 20% tip as the minimum suggestion.<//review>

<Text>Solid restaurant for any vegetarians out there. Especially good if you’re looking for a place to treat a vegetarian out-of-towner. The menu is delicious across the board, and the wait staff is quite friendly. If you’re going to for brunch, the ginger waffle is a must get for the table to share. Cocktails are typically good, with their mimosas being very refreshing. The Bloody Mary needs some improvement, and the hostess who sat our group had some attitude, but otherwise a great spot that I like to visit occasionally.</Text><rating>4< /rating><gmap_id>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df<//gmap_id><time>1555887627207<//time><response>None</response><Name>Shane Mang< /Name></record>

I had to modify my review due to the non existence level of accessibility of this place, we’ve been everywhere in LA, this is the only place where they denied to sit us because we were a party of seven and they even refused to split us up. Because “they don’t make the rules” and they’re enforcing them but no other restaurant in LA is doing it. The hostess is mean, rude and I don’t recall why is she the first person you see when you come to this restaurant. AVOID this place.</review>

Fab vegan place. I had the blackbean burger and it was really delicious. They have wine, beer and cocktails. The setting is cool and staff are lovely. Most of the seating is communal but they do have separate tables too.</Text>

<Time>1527264699638< /Time><rate>3< /rate><Text>The place is lovely and instagram-able but the quality of the vegan food isn’t consistent. The carrot lox is delicious but the ($14) burrito is just ok and the ($6 for 3 pieces) vegan bacon was not good.

It’s also a bit weird that a vegetarian restaurant doesn’t offer egg alternatives like a tofu scramble, or tofu eggs Benedict for brunch.

Overall staff was friendly, atmosphere was lovely, and the food was ok but too expensive for the quality.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had a fantastic dinner with some friends last night. Our host Olivia was phenomenal and very friendly. She treated us like family and kept us all occupied with good laughs, food and drinks without any delays! Will be returning again soon with more hungry and thirsty mouths.
PS. Sabrine was an amazing welcomer and took care of our group with superb efficiency and professionalism.
Great team altogether !</text>

<Review>Had a salad as they change the menu by 5.30 and the other option was pizza and I didn’t want pizza (we were there at 5.15).
The cesar salad was awesome! The sourness of the vegan cheese was phenomenal, really well done.
I would have given ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ but minus one because no bread.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df< /gmapID>< username>

But let’s be honest, half of the customer’s waiting in line want to go because of the hype, the other half want to go because of the hype.  That is not supposed to make sense, because neither does the formation of a line outside of the restaurant.

At best, the food is mediocre. At worst, you‘re emotionally distraught after having been served a cocktail of unmet expectations, flavorless food, and slow service.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3znCWiZRAGpJZQuroH6a-l9vHaW6jxp9PHT0S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

It must be under new management because I don't understand all the good reviews on here. One of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten at. It was rather embarrassing as I was with a group of 4 and we were served bland, cold and greasy food. The staff wouldn't even bring us water for the table, shunning us for wasting water.... It was rather overpriced and the portions were tiny. $145 dollars for one course the with the group and had to go grab more food afterwards! I would not recommend!</Text>

Food is good. However, two major flaws: service is very slow. And the sweet potato fries were burnt. Drinks are perhaps a bit overpriced - I know everything in Venice is but... it’s a bit overpriced for Venice too. Everything else was good, great attention to detail (cleanliness in the bathroom could be improved though), nice atmosphere and friendly staff.< /review>

<time>1564979596493</time><review>I ordered an almond milk/coconut/dates smoothie called '7 Minutes In Heaven' (which I dragged to 20) and a burrito called 'Surfer's Breakfast'. It was pricey, around $30, but it was AMAZING! It may be placebo but I also felt healthier if I'm being honest.</review>< Rating>

<Review>Hostess told us 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't a problem. Later she seats two other couples before us, when confronted she tried to tell one of the people in each of the parties come in before and made the reservation. I said yes they did but it was after us. She then got all nervous because she didn't think I was paying that close attention. She was then embarrassed. The waitress was nice but took 15 minutes to get a beer and a glass of wine. Maybe other people think it's great but I wasn't impressed at all. To many other places with good food and much better service and ambiance.<//Review>< time>

Very accommodating to change vegetarian meals here vegan. They have a super friendly staff and very charming atmosphere. The decoration is on point and the food is great, just a bit pricy on the juices, but that’s to be expected when it comes to fresh juice. Overall, great experience and I’d recommend it to anyone.< /Text>

<text>I randomly got there because it was rainy and I was in the street. They provided what I was looking for. A place to seat, drink coffee and have some food. The crowd was entertaining too so I had a good time while eating. The waiter did a great job but the lady at the door wanted to give me a bad seat so I changed to feel more comfortable.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles! The restaurant management seemed to be different this time around, however. The juice didn’t seem as fresh, neither did any of the produce in the dishes. Even the mint in the water was browning. The burger seemed to be slapped on to an old bun with a couple arugula leaves. All of these menu items used to be AMAZING. So sad to see this restaurant’s demise!< /text><Date>1562769245762< /Date>< rate>

<Review>Very cramped place with very small tables and backless seats. The other tables are so close to you that we weren't even able to enjoy a private conversation or even place our legs comfortably. Also, beware of the restaurant's name as this is a vegetarian place. I didn't enjoy my meal as much as I hoped for. I got the Dolce Picante pizza and while it sounded as it would be spicy, it was just an overly sweet pizza that felt more like a dessert than a meal. I don't understand the high ratings but maybe to each their food preferences.</Review>< Pics>

The restaurant is beautiful. The staff is incredibly attentive, but so is the staff at a strip club and the food is probably better. I want to love The Butcher's Daughter but there's something about the easily forgettable menu and basic to uninteresting choices.  Even the burrito leaves something to be desired and how do you screw up a burrito.  The cocktails are good and the scones are alright but cocktails and scones do not a meal make.  Save yourself some time hit the donut shop across the street if you want slightly overpriced food that fills you up.< /Text>

I’m not a Vegan, but I don’t think I ever tasted something vegan that tasty (too much garlic though). They even have different types of plant based bacon, and obviously the impossible burger.< /Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>The place is really creatively decorated. It’s clean and inviting! The food was delicious and the service was also good. (I just think they should offer a little piece of chocolate or biscuit with the espresso 😐) The only thing why I gave 4 stars is because it’s a little overpriced. Beers at 10 dollars and wines at 13+ are a no go as well as some of the food plates. But it is worthy going at least once and take the conclusion by yourself.</Text>< Pictures>

Except for the lovely girl at the bar who served us, the rest of the staff is arrogant and annoying, but maybe that’s just LA? Aaanyway, food, menu, vibe, deco, music, all is amazing. Will come again.< /Text>

<Review>Great food experience even for a meat eater like myself. The crab cakes (jerk meat) tasted just like crab meat. Love the play on words with the menu also. Good seating and ambiance. Only con is the bathrooms. The place is large and seats so many and there are only to restrooms unisex and no real line formation since it just stands in middle of room. Beyond that it's a must come back and recommend< /Review>< pictures>

Very accommodating to change vegetarian meals here vegan. They have a super friendly staff and very charming atmosphere. The decoration is on point and the food is great, just a bit pricy on the juices, but that’s to be expected when it comes to fresh juice. Overall, great experience and I’d recommend it to anyone.< /Review>

The place is really creatively decorated. It’s clean and inviting! The food was delicious and the service was also good. (I just think they should offer a little piece of chocolate or biscuit with the espresso 😐) The only thing why I gave 4 stars is because it’s a little overpriced. Beers at 10 dollars and wines at 13+ are a no go as well as some of the food plates. But it is worthy going at least once and take the conclusion by yourself.< /review>

The restaurant is beautiful. The staff is incredibly attentive, but so is the staff at a strip club and the food is probably better. I want to love The Butcher's Daughter but there's something about the easily forgettable menu and basic to uninteresting choices.  Even the burrito leaves something to be desired and how do you screw up a burrito.  The cocktails are good and the scones are alright but cocktails and scones do not a meal make.  Save yourself some time hit the donut shop across the street if you want slightly overpriced food that fills you up.< /Review>

What a fantastic place. Design of restaurant is flawless.  Wine selection - divine.  Food -delicious.  Will, the bartender is exactly who I'd want working for me if I ever owned a bar. friendly, attentive, personable with great suggestions.   The experience was perfect.  Abbot restaurants have a tendency to be boring, this place could not have been better.  Thank you for doing what you do!< /Review>

The breakfast tacos were delicious! The whole place is just gorgeous. There are plants everywhere, the staff was great and the food plus coffee was worth the price.  It's normally priced in comparison to everything in LA.</Review>

we enjoyed a lovely meal and great service here. the space is bright and green...and so is the food! We got unique drinks: matcha and a lavender mocha. The highlight was the mushroom risotto and the impossible sausage (a first for my crew, half vegetarian, half not). All in all, a great time.< /review>

<Name>Priyanka Kompella<//Name><Review>This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles! The restaurant management seemed to be different this time around, however. The juice didn’t seem as fresh, neither did any of the produce in the dishes. Even the mint in the water was browning. The burger seemed to be slapped on to an old bun with a couple arugula leaves. All of these menu items used to be AMAZING. So sad to see this restaurant’s demise!<//Review></record>

I ordered an almond milk/coconut/dates smoothie called '7 Minutes In Heaven' (which I dragged to 20) and a burrito called 'Surfer's Breakfast'. It was pricey, around $30, but it was AMAZING! It may be placebo but I also felt healthier if I'm being honest.< /Text>

Had the vegan version of the surfers breakfast burrito and there wasn’t much in it for the price - and way too much vegan cheese. It would be nice to have some healthy vegan options that don’t use so much processed junk.<//Text>< Pics>

One of the best vegan-friendly restaurants I've been to in the United States. Service was superb, and the home made vegan cheeses were outstanding. Took a group of non-vegans and they were blown away. The vegan pizzas were particularly to die for.<//text>

We went there last Saturday around 6:30pm.
We were shocked when the waitress came to take out order as she was completely high & it was hard for her to even stand straight. I think she had dark hair with bangs & plain white skin, in case the owner wants to identify who it was. We ordered the Market Pasta, it was the worse paste ever. It felt like we are eating rubber. The food is not good. There were flies inside as well.< /Text>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Loved my experience here. Brunched here on Saturday during prime time noon and it took about 20 minutes to get a table. I love how they take your number and will text you when the table was ready. I was able to walk down to Intelligentcia to grab coffee while I was waiting. By the time I walked back, my table was ready.  It was perfect.

It was nice out, so I was able to sit in the patio. It's such a fun and trendy vibe this place and it feels like a garden. The waitstaff was friendly both times that I've been here.

I ordered the Avocado Benedict and a side of the Impossible Burger patty, which tasted like sausage. My entire meal was mouth watering and satisfied my cravings. Even enjoyed a glass of the green drink Prosecco. It was like the green drink was canceling out the sin and refreshing! Had a perfect Saturday here.</Text><date>1560437269500<//date>< Rating>

<Review>Great place! I went on a Saturday around 2pm the wait was about 1 hour for bigger parties but since I was a party of 1 I sat down immediately. The decor is very stylish with indoor/ outdoor seating. The service staff is very friendly and attentive.

I order the huevos rancheros, it was good but not something I would order again. The water flower is delicious and very sweet.

Perfect place to meet your girl/guy friends for brunch</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The food is good, but it's LA, you have to be good to survive. Give me something special.... you don't. Your food is OK, but your hostess was unbearable. I appreciate a busy restaurant, it's good for the city, it's good for the vibe, but I moreso appreciate the experience, if I wanted a stern talking to, I'd call my mother and explain why I couldn't call her on her birthday, The Butchers Daughter seems to have gotten to big for her britches. From a Venice local fan, to a disappointed "never again, the place is so cookie cutter" Check Please< /text>< pics>

<review>Yummm, and hip. Mostly what you'd expect from a trendy vegetarian spot on Abbot Kinney, with some deliciously seasoned recipes.

The brunch options were pretty standard but they tasted great. I got the shakshouka and boo got the avo toast Benedict - again, both delivered. Staff was also pretty friendly and the interior had a great look.

Check it out!</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

Poor service. $34 to split an order of avocado toast with a very poorly cooked poached egg (it seriously could have bounced on the ground like a rubber ball) and 2 canned drinks? Yeah. No, thanks. Not worth it by any stretch of the imagination. Waste of money and calories.<//Review>

Surprisingly unfriendly to vegans for a vegetarian restaurant - my friend and I searched the menu for 20 minutes for good vegan options and didn't find much. That was after waiting a long time for a seat at the bar then waiting forever for our waiter to even acknowledge us. We got up and left.< /Review>

<Review>We went there last Saturday around 6:30pm.
We were shocked when the waitress came to take out order as she was completely high & it was hard for her to even stand straight. I think she had dark hair with bangs & plain white skin, in case the owner wants to identify who it was. We ordered the Market Pasta, it was the worse paste ever. It felt like we are eating rubber. The food is not good. There were flies inside as well.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<username>Meek K<//username><response>None</response><Text>I LOVE the Butchers daughter. Whenever I have to go to Santa Monica I make sure on the way back to hit this restaurant. So first off parking and driving around here is a cross between Mad Max and Lord of the flies. It isn't for the faint of heart. You will have to walk a ways. Just relax and be prepared. The Butchers daughter is worth it. Ok if you've braved that much and get there you may be in a line and waiting for seating. I was there on a Friday and it was busier and we still only waited maybe 15 minutes. The place is beautiful so I just soak it in and eavesdrop on some ridiculous conversations. I tried the egg white frittata with asparagus, carmelized onions, some greens, and pesto. Delicious and healthy. Then I got my favorite Rose and cardamom almond milk latte. Delicious. Check the pic its gorgeous!! I have loved everything I get there. Very bohemian decor and lots of plants. The staff is great. Tim waited on my friend and I and he is wonderful and has really good hair lol. I think I know Charlie from somewhere but he is awesome also. So friendly and genuine. You can not miss if you stop and enjoy the Butchers Daughter. Just do it. Up the cool quotient in you day. Relax and eat the fresh and yummy fare and make like Marie Antoinette and try some rose & cardamom latte. Not brave, that's ok they have coffee and good old lattes too. If you liked my review please give it a like and comment if you have a question. Thank you. Have a beautiful day</Text><GmapID>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df<//GmapID><time>1566655766195</time>< Pictures>

The biggest peeve I have here is that vegans miss out. Most dishes have egg added into them for breakfast,  if you choose to leave out the egg there is no substitute. They do however upcharge for any vegan addition but they don't subtract for the egg which is annoying. Second peeve is the wooden benches...THE most uncomfortable seats ever. Prices are a bit high for what they're serving. Cute place and great coffee though.</Text>

There is a mostly vegan menu that, even if you aren't vegan, you're guaranteed to love.

There is a great look inside of this place that feels like home with a positive vibe. It's fairly overpriced but every vegan place from here to Portland Oregon or anywhere else is like that. I wish this were different. But it's well worth the visit.</review>< pics>

<review>Food was mediocre. Avo toast from any other brunch place will beat out the $16 one(with egg lol) offered here. Brunch burrito had no flavor to it, it’s appalling $15 gets you something so similar to a starbucks grab n go container. You’re definitely paying for the rustic ambiance and cool shrubbery going on throughout the place. But maybe I just dont get “it” — it has to be a style thing for red pepper flakes to be served in a tiny open bottle right? Shakers are so yesterday guys Im gonna just start carrying salt in my airpods case</review></record></dataset><record>

Over priced drinks. I'm talking almost 20$ drinks. The food was ok but nothing to write home about. This feels like one of those places people tell you that you have to try without actually having anything meaningful to say about why.</Review>

There have been times when I've gotten good service here. During the weekends they'll get very busy and the regular wait times will be 30-45 minutes, on the plus side they will text you when your table is ready. There is an unlikely chance you'll get a good table. This restaurant will put famous people in priority first, they'll get served first, they'll get a table first, and they'll get the better table. Wherease there have been many times where they gave me and my friends the bar seating.

You go for the bougie pleasing aesthetic experience not the service. Its a nice place in a very crowded area. The food is very healthy and good (but expensive, just be prepared to spend money).

You'll want to park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I thoroughly enjoyed this place. I've been to The Butcher's Son in Berkeley and was curious if this would be similar but it's totally different.

There is a mostly vegan menu that, even if you aren't vegan, you're guaranteed to love.

There is a great look inside of this place that feels like home with a positive vibe. It's fairly overpriced but every vegan place from here to Portland Oregon or anywhere else is like that. I wish this were different. But it's well worth the visit.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Loved my experience. Atmosphere was perfect, server was friendly and attentive. The juice flight with the 4 basic juices was delish, wish I doubled up on carrot! Avocado toast was well done and the mushroom bowl was a real stand out.< /Text>

<Text>Absolutely 💙 this place!!! You definitely can't go wrong with anything you can find on the menu!

The atmosphere is vibrant and the staff go out of their way to maintain this energy.

Tasty dishes and delivery service via doordash is also a highlight.

My compliments to the chef and the staff putting food together!<//Text>< Pictures>

Im not a vegetarian, but the food here was great. Ive only ever ordered one thing but I have no reason to change it. The breakfast burrito is fantastic. The berry smoothie is okay but the large seeds are a bit offputting and the paper straw creates difficulty as it dissolves quickly.

All that said, breakfast burrito, yes. Prices are high, don't get me wrong, but great burrito and didn't miss the meat at all.< /text>

If you're vegan and you don't eat honey, you'll have a hard time finding a dish you don't need to modify. Likewise if you don't like excessively sweet drinks. The juice I had was tooth-tinglingly sweet, and the smoothie I got (a green one with avocado, kale, and cilantro) had so much sweetened coconut in it that I couldn't even stretch to say it was healthy. I came at 11:00 and they said that by no means could I see a lunch menu to order a salad, I would have to wait until 11:30. It was also busy and noisy, but I expected as much.</Text>

So much hype around place, it's a IG must right? The decor is on point 👌🏽 Gorgeous if you're looking for a photo opt. As far as food and service goes I'd have to say it's hit and miss. I've been here a few times and the first time was during the day on a weekday. It was slow and the service was amazing! The food was good. It looked pretty and it tasted good. The second time was at night it was packed, the coffee was awful!!! The service was slow and we were forgotten about. So I would recommend a weekday while most people are at work, always use valet parking if you are not from the area.< /Review>

Pretty cool and trendy place, went here for brunch and it was packed, waited around 40 mins to get seated, hostess took us to the bar when we though we were going to get seated at a table.

At the end of the day we already waited that long so we stood there.

Food is good and they have creative cocktails.
Coffee looks amazing and it has its own section.

Beautiful decor!< /text>

<review>How disappointing. Such a beautiful setting with an amazing menu. The service was neglectful and slow. The coffee was weak and poorly presented, so disappointing after my high hopes of seeing a flat white on the menu. Despite what looks to be a good selection, the food was average at best. Don't bother with the pastries or sweet food, the texture and taste are well off.< /review>< UserId.>

<text>Really gone down hill.  My last few experiences have been less than satisfactory with soupy burritos and stale GF bread. Final straw however was when I waited over 30 min for a take away order. I was told it would take about 10 min. 25 min later they tell me they lost my order due to a computer glitch?  Not sure why it took so long to tell me as I was sitting there in front of them the entire time. They said they would rush the order but then I ran out of time and had to leave. They said they would refund my order, which they did...but they kept their $5 for my tumeric latte. A fact they failed to tell me they would be doing when I left. Really?   Terrible customer service.<//text>< Pics>

<Name>Nicole Kohan<//Name><date>1531957313945< /date><rating>4<//rating><text>Cute spot for a veggie-lover's dinner. I enjoyed the decor and all of the little details and thought they put into the ambiance.

Service was on point! Hunter was super genuine and friendly. I'm not a fan of c communal seating; it's awkward when you have a large group and all want to sit together. Instead, the waitress opted to take us 7 girls back to a private table outside (the only table I saw on the back patio) which was super cute!! If you have a small party of 5+, this is the spot to be in. It had a glass fireplace to the side of us which was nice on a cool and windy night such as that one was, and a wall of real succulents behind us! I love succulents! The music was also quieter out there so we didn't have to yell to hear each other (too loud inside to catch up with girl friends).

DRINKS were very good! My friend and I had the Queen's tea or something it was called, and it tasted like a light alcoholic earl grey tea - so unique! My other friend had their special french wine which was also very good, I'm not sure of the name.

For FOOD, I shared the spicy Caesar salad and the burger (minus the guyreye cheese). We shared a regular margherita pizza as an appetizer. One of my girl friends had the "crab cakes" which she said were pretty good.  Overall I'd come here again.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Apparently, many things that are vegan or can be made vegan are not listed as vegan on the menu. The scones (not vegan) were amazing. I also enjoyed the unusual lattes and mochas. The classic avocado toast was good but a little ho-hum and the bread was a little thick and over toasted. The buckwheat pancakes (vegan) were tasty but a little thick for my tastes. I am surprised they didn’t present them with more beautiful plating and more interesting toppings. Staff was kind and accommodating.< /Text>

I've been to Venice Beach a few times and love Abbott Kinney the shops, restaurants & vibe is perfect.  Somehow on prior trips is missed The Butcher's Daughter but this trip I fixed that.

Omg love everything about this place!  So we'd just eaten before finding it so decided to try the juice flight instead & each one was better than the one before so you can't go wrong.

My only suggestion is they need to sell their juice mugs!  Apparently I'm not the only one to ask to purchase them but they've yet to make them available.

That being said you can purchase take away cartons and I did.< /Text>

<Text>Amazing food. The açai bowl was tops: (ice cream-like scoops of açai berry freeze with sliced fruit and some sort of excellent crispy crunchy buckwheat groats? ) Our coffee was excellent - (we live in seattle). Ginger waffle with cinnamon apple was also crunchy and perfect.
Chocolate chip cookie was in my top ten percent.

Best of all was the atmosphere: airy with great cool light. Artfully decorated with rustic industrial, plants, and paintings/sculptures.

Packed with people, but still not noisy due to high ceilings and texture of surfaces.

Bathroom was elegant, spacious and clean.

They sell coffee and pastries to go - so  you don’t have to sit down. Just walk up to the counter and ask. They also sell a well curated selection of wines and other interesting products.</Text>< pics>

I actually only had the coffee here as I came to finish up a few things for work.  I saw a few people on their laptops so I didn't think it was a big deal.  However, that was fairly early on a Saturday morning.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and seems to be a nice place for brunch.  Many of the seats are bar style.  As far as the coffee goes, I've had better drop coffee at the $5 price point but it wasn't horrible.< /text>

The two in NYC are so much better in terms of menu and service. I have been a few times over the last few weeks for brunch and not blown away. I also ordered a takeaway coffee and had to throw it in the bin. After paying $5 for it. The milk had been way over steamed. It is a very pretty venue. But service patchy. Some of the woman that work there need to learn to smile.</Text>

< Review>
$11 for a 16 oz smoothie 🤔😏... OK, I'm willing bc I'llpay a little extra for peace of mind on the quality it will be. Its abbot Kinney$$$ and it's the butcher's daughter so its probably gonna be phenomenal but then it came out in like 2 minutes. It was like soup through a straw with a chunk of granola on the bottom. Didn't taste all that great or appear to be of much quality and on top of the $11 charge for this sub par smoothie there's a 3% health and wellness charge? Didn't I come all the way here and find parking on abbot kinney and pay $11 for a health and wellness type of smoothie? I could go to Jamba Juice and get a smooth with equal or more quality and equally "health and wellness".<//Review>

I had never had smoked tequila until ten bartender gave me that drink, and I was transported to another plan of reality after one sip.

The food is freaking amazing, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A VEGAN. I LIKE BLOOD (I know, you're triggered)...and I still loved this place. Get some Pho soup or try the Acai bowl! My mouth is watering now just remembering how sweet the sorbet was and how awesome the soup was.

The staff was an absolute delight, and super helpful with knowledge about the area. I highly recommend this place!< /Text>

The buckwheat pancakes infused with matcha green tea were absolutely delicious. Great vibe, super friendly staff! Only reason I’m not giving five stars is that they were sold if of seven minutes of heaven and I traveled 3000 miles to taste it. Good news is that I might get one more opportunity before heading home later this week. Just adding that we went back two more times before heading home and had seven minutes of heaven both times!  The fresh brewed coffee is soooo good!!< /text>< user_name>

Delicious vegetarian food in a fun and hip setting. Not everything is vegan, but can be made vegan if needed. I would highly recommend the cauliflower steak.< /review>

The "Impossible Burger" was nothing special and definitely not worth $26. A bean burger on a bun with fries and ketchup. You could have at least included a pickle, lettuce, and a tomato slice. Not worth it.  Otherwise it's a nice atmosphere and experience.< /Review>

As a Seattleite it’s weird to me that there’s no butter or jam for the toast but I’ve noticed that in other places in LA and I also think if I said anything they would have brought some. Just weird! No wonder everyone is hyped about avocado toast, they’ve probably never had anything on their toasted bread before, lol.</Review>< gmap_id>

Came with no sides except for a few bits of lettuce with no dressing. Not even toast. I also got a tiny 8 oz latte. Total price: $25 (plus tip!) I just left the restaurant and I'm still kind of hungry . If you going to charge those kind of prices you should really serve a full meal and reasonable sized drinks. Also, service was slooooow.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Never fails! Tonight we got the carbonara (which is made with spaghetti squash, egg, and cashew cheese), mushroom lasagna, and "crab" cake (made with quinoa and sweet potato). The carbonara was the surprise highlight of the evening!!!! The "crab" cake was incredible as well...
On previous occasions we had the cauliflower steak and cocktails; all magnificent!
Prices are standard for Venice ($$$), though some of the items were more reasonable than others.
The ambiance here is soo cute- like a rustic, cozy garden tastefully decorated, yet still very upscale.
We sat outside in the patio and it was perfect! Very romantic, every table was candlelit and the water comes with mint- nice touch :-)
Fantastic spot for a date!< /review>

<review>This place is a joke. Hot water in espresso sized cup with cayenne pepper sprinkled on? (Not at all what I ordered). $6 charge. Same thing I order at the original NYC location everyday for half the prize, twice the size, and get the actual drink. This place is nothing like it. Outrageous prices for low quality food. Ambience is nice, service is bad, food is bad. Items claimed to be gluten-free are not necessarily gluten-free.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I love the design and the concept of this restaurant.

Meal: I ordered the cauliflower TBone steak and it was just like the experience of eating a steak complete with charred edges, a steak knife, and a sauce that replicated juicy meat.

For a large vegetable, I felt like the price was a little high - almost the same cost as if I had ordered an actual piece of (beef) steak. There were no sides included in the price.

I would return again.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Awesome breakfast, nice atmosphere

We had breakfast there with the entire family and were pleased. While the eggs are on the smaller side, we liked the selection of juices and the nice coffee.

Staff is very attentive and nice. Definitely a cool and hipstery place to spend some time.</Text>

The ambience and decor is beautiful, and the lighting from the skylights provide for picture-perfect photos. The service is very slow however when busy, and the food was good, just not as spectacular as the setting.<//Review>< pics>

While the  service was okay, we found it quite rude to be forced to pay a certain percentage and not be able to decide for yourself, as the place was basically deciding for you how the service was.< /text>< Pictures>

The atmosphere is really nice, but I am not sure about the taste.. getting some starters with wine is the thing I'll do next time because they created a very nice atmosphere. Also I was there for dinner maybe the experience for brunch is different.< /Review>

The butcher’s daughter has great brunch food, and the best candles you’ll ever find, but good luck making a reservation, they have the worst phone service, if you try and call their number you’ll be redirected to an endless loop of automated messages.

Update: I went there today and the girl was very apologetic, i guess they’re having issues with their phones, the candles are still great.<//review>

As the vegetarian daughter of a pig veterinarian father (you know, the person who keeps the pigs healthy for the butcher), I felt an immediate connection with this place (an exclusively vegetarian restaurant). My husband and I went on a Wednesday night and the place was full, but we got a table in under 10 minutes. Seating was a bit tight (I did get a accidental wack across the back of my head from someone trying to get to his seat), but not cramped. The service was good (friendly waiter, complimentary drink following drink order mishap). Food was great! My husband and I split the marinated olives (perfectly salty, warm, and oily), the impossible burger (same texture as a beef burger according to my husband), and the Carbonara ("angel hair" spaghetti squash). All were delicious, but the Carbonara could have used more salt (opinion influenced by Samin Nosrat's discussion of salt in her book Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat). Even so, the flavors were spot on (just needing some salty enhancement). Overall, great casual dining spot for vegetarians or anyone looking for more vegetable forward dinner options.< /Text>

I really like the ambience. It's very hip. Spicy half Cesar salad with a hard poached egg. For the dessert, I got raspberry chocolate torte. It's made out of dates and cashew. Yum.<//Text>

<text>If I was white enough to be here, I would be.
Came in for a coffee and a male model asked me warmly how I felt about fair trade.
Don't ask for tequila , you'll be looked at like an alcoholic. And they don't have a full bar.
Also, something smells pungently of wild mushrooms and pu**y. Not sure if it's the essential oil or just me sweating to fit in.
It's an Urban Outfitters and just like everything on this street, doesnt sell what you think they do. This is a vegetarian restaurant, cute as can be. They also only give you one sugar packet with a tumbler of coffee and I am too scared to ask for more.
Lots of uncomfortable date watching tho, and white women that hate each other. You're not allowed to talk above a whisper. Didn't know how my voice projected until I was asking about hard liquor.
At least I didn't ask for a steak.

<text>One of our favourite brunch locations in Venice. You can't go wrong with anything in the menu really. Acai bowl is a hit and so is the avocado toast (in it's different forms). Awesome choice of fresh juices and smoothies plus great coffee!

It get's busy at weekends, but wait times are normally less than 25min and you can take a nice stroll along Abbot Kinney which is never a bad idea :)< /text>< pictures>

This is a chic coffee shop I enjoyed with my daughter while on vacation. They have friendly waiters. It's expensive but it trendy hot spot in Venice Beach area.</Text>

<review>Very disappointed in the food, especially cosidering the hype and wait. We went for lunch and got a power bowl and surfers breakfast burrito. The power bowl had very undercooked black rice which made the whole thing inedible. The mole beans on the burrito we're very good, but unfortunately, there were not enough of them and the serving size was very small. Love plant based restaurants, but this place was nothing special, aside from the great decorating. Oh the beer was nice and cold.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Review for brunch. It's very solid food and wonderful ambiance, but it simply is not good or unique enough to justify the cost, hassle (it's in trendy and busy and crowded Abbot Kinney) and wait.

I love that this place is all vegetarian and orders so many vegan options. But seriously - breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros, with substantial extra cost for vegan meats? Go to Senor G's in Marina del Rey for better food at half the cost and zero wait.</review>

I only came for a beer and a cappuccino.  Really nice design.  Bright, good temperature, open kitchen.  The beer was good and excellent cappuccino.  I want to go back when I am hungry, or for another coffee.</Review>

<text>This restaurant is trendy, overpriced, and unsatisfying to the stomach. I understand the need for updated trendy restaurants with interesting menu items. But I'm not one for trendy, I want staples. A friend was in town, and our other friend was closer to this restaurant and I wasn't asked for my opinions on a meal location. I had two soft boiled eggs and soldiers with jam. The soldiers (thick cut toast) were dry. The house made jam was unappealing. The eggs were made correctly and were good. My boyfriend and I had the same meal, he didn't touch his jam after one bite, I needed mine on the toast. It's a vegetarian restaurant, but I couldn't find much on the menu that even sounded appetizing to me. It was severely overpriced in our opinion.  I also got a ginger shot, which was nice and strong but didn't taste fresh. I shared a touch of it with my friend's vegan girlfriend, she was of a similar mindset. She had avocado toast with other stuff on it with a side of vegan sausage. The sausage smelled and looked delicious, but she didn't finish it so I can't be sure on taste. I wasn't interested in paying out the nose for an avocado on a piece of bread. That was my second menu choice if I hadn't gotten the eggs and soldiers.

If you enjoy the super trendy food cycle we seem to be going through and you have the funds to support your habit, you may enjoy this place. If you do not and are more of my persuasion, stick to your own kitchen.<//text>< pictures>

Food is nice, reasonably tasty.  Lacto ovo veg with decent vegan selection.  Atmosphere is bright, casual, friendly; "shabby chic" farm styling.   Busy.  Can get hectic at peak times.  It's about fifty percent overpriced compared to similar restaurants in other parts of town.</Text>

I am very anti vegetarian only restaurants but I make an exception for this restaurant alone. Coffee needs improvement but there's blue bottle and intelligencia just a few blocks away on either side.< /text>

Great drinks and tasty vegetarian food offerings - very friendly and helpful staff as well. While I generally tend to lean more towards the carnivore side of things, I consider my visit to The Butcher's Daughter one of the culinary highlights of my most recent trip to L.A.</text>

A vegetarian's delight, in an boho-chic wonderland (oh yeah, and great food)!  This place isn't 'cheap' per-se, but it also won't break the bank like many Abbot Kinney spots can do. GO!</text>

<review>Loved it for lunch, so I took friends for dinner. The wait was 45 mins for a table for five - they do not take reservations - and half of the tables were empty for the entire duration of our wait.

I love the place and its concept - and I am known for loving to spend top dollar on extraordinary food. However, I found the prices for drinks at bar overly excessive - average wine $15/ glass - and my "Berliner Weisse" Beer was a disaster. Served from a can - aid you'd serve that in a Berlin beer place you are likely to get shot.

Then: dinner. Again, we love the place and the concept. Starters arrived only one minute before entrees. Our "Spaghetti Carbonara" - we know it's Squash Spaghetti - did not remotely resemble anything that compares to Carbonara. The waiter asked if we'd like it with bread crumbs - not that I ever heard that Carbonara is served with any bread in it - and we agreed. Sadly, it came without - and a check back why was ignored. To avoid any misunderstanding: it was nice - better was at $20.

Only two stars: we were constantly asked "may I take your plate" - even though the plates were half full. At one time, when engaged in a conversation with our friends, my wife did not respond quick enough - and half of her entree was gone. They did credit it on the check - but that was not the idea. She left hungry.

Finally, 20% gratuity was automatically added - they say customary for a party of five. For me: not good enough. I will not go again.<//review>< pictures>

I was blown away by the food, atmosphere and service.  As someone with food allergies, this was one of the few places where I was asked right away if I had any allergies.  It may seem like a small detail, but I am so used to having to assert my allergy at new places.  The espresso bar was fantastic.  Their avacado toast and matcha drinks completely rocked my frail Minnesotan tastebuds!< /Text>

<Review>Ok so to be honest, when we came here we thought it was bbq. Once we realized it was vegan, we decided to stay and try it with an open mind. We ordered imitation crab cakes and a veggie burger with fries and coleslaw. I will say that everything we ate including the drinks were nothing weve ever tasted before. Including the froes and coleslaw. There were so many robust flavors in everything it was hard to tell weather or not i liked it. Overall for 2 plates and 2 drinks we spent like 70 bucks and ended up taking half of it home... But it was an experience I guess. Service was nice but seating very awkward. Not a very comfortable place to chill.<//Review><username>Elizabeth Holmes< /username>< UserId.>

I took my wife and daughter here because they are hardcore vegetarians borderline vegans but I fuel my machine in a state of ketosis. I only eat a ketogenic diet. I was forced to sit next to them while they ate the most incredible pizza that smelled absolutely divine they ate a salad that was to be honest ridiculously delicious looking and the juices that they had we're the best my daughter ever had. Several times people came up to me and said are you sure there's nothing we can get you like it was obvious that they felt bad that I was not able to eat anything from there. I made an offhand it mention that if I was going to cheat on my diet it would be to eat a piece of their coconut chocolate cake. When I was finished paying the bill and tipping one of the employees walked up to me and gave me a piece of cake for free with a smile and said here you go. They absolutely care here. I felt warmth and happiness. If you are vegetarian and you are looking for somewhere to go if you are a vegan and looking for somewhere to go this is not a place to be missed. Absolutely make sure you come here. By the way I said screw it and broke from my diet and I ate the cake and damnit that cake was delicious. Vegan yes but 100% delicious and full of flavor. If we find ourselves back in Venice we will most certainly be coming here.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2i3GkzhjoplBaLJZPN-FbaPUm9q8K2tyy4RNH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Yum yum yum yum yum!!!! Everything is amazing but the hostess was so rude and not at all accommodating with my baby. She said I should hold the baby in my lap while I ate because I couldn't keep stroller with me. Had I not enjoyed everything else so much I would have complained to the manager.< /text>< Name>

<Text>this place is a joke. Bad service, snob attitude, extremely loud. Pricey! We had a disgusting squash "carbonara" and a small basil sandwich -  that had no taste -  and 2 juices and we ended up to pay around 50 USD!!! Hello? Sitting on umcortable stools in a loud place full of instagrammers and wannabes too focused to take pictures and talking loud more than having a look to what they were eating and paying for. Don't look at the location, is just a trap: is not all gold what glitters!< /Text>< Pics>

<Date>1528565395794<//Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>So, so darling.  I kind of want to live in this space.  The white brick, the light wood, the cute farm stools, skylights, wood beam ceilings......it's what I visualize when I think of my perfect kitchen.

Full disclosure....I am not vegan.  I'm not vegetarian.  I don't need gluten free.  In fact, I kind of dislike vegetables.  However, I was with two of my favorite people who have embraced the LA lifestyle so when they suggested this place, I was game.

We came in solely for dessert and were NOT disappointed.  We ordered three different desserts and shared between us:  the warm ice cream sandwich (chocolate chip cookies with salted caramel ice cream), the apple crumb cake (with vanilla bean ice cream ala mode), and the raw pot de creme (chocolate mousse and chai bourbon).  ALL good!  We were in consensus that the apple crumb cake, which we didn't think would be our favorite, actually was.

The cookies with the warm ice cream sandwich would've been better if they had been warm but the ice cream helped to soften them and the caramel sauce drizzled on top was scrumptious.  The pot de creme was fairly salty.  I actually love salty and sweet together so it was good in that sense.  But the apple dessert was just perfection.  We really should've ordered three of those instead.

The service was friendly and efficient.  No complaints.

And the fact that they sell sage sticks to purify your space made me feel super LA.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Make sure to get a reservation we didn't have one and it was a forty minute wait :( The food was good though and very pricey! Especially the juices (pineapple and passion fruit ones were my favorites) I am not a vegetarian so I didn't enjoy when I got noodles there wasn't chicken lol! But if you are vegetarian I recommend it! ALSO this place is not vegan they do serve eggs but they would probably have stuff for vegans too :) hope this helped!</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bac74de94d6f:0x1e297f1177fa15df</Gmap_id><Date>1526681876044< /Date>< resp>

If you aren't a vegetarian I wouldn't suggest it. This is a vegetarian restaurant so the flavors aren't exactly stellar. Service is subpar as well and our waiter was too focused on getting phone numbers from his other tables.< /text>

Meh. Not great for vegans. It's the sort of place one goes to pretend they are vegetarian. Service was not great either. Coffee tasted great when it finally came though. Liked the atmosphere too.<//text>

< Review>
Brought my 70 year old mum to this restaurant (that has celiac disease) as the restaurant advertises 'gluten free', and you assume a vegetarian restaurant would take care with customers with allergies...... So I sat through a tasteless lunch of bread and avocado for $15, but didn't complain as I was taking care of my mum.

However, as soon as we got home she started being sick and has now been throwing up for 30 mins.

Restaurants that don't take care of people with allergies are a disgrace, especially when they advertise the fact.

In London, an owner of a restaurant recently fed someone peanuts whom had nut allergies, and the customer then died.  The restaurant owner went to jail.  It's about time these restaurants took some responsibility.<//Review>

Amazing, its expensive but its worth it since every other place puts fat meat and cheese into everything they make.

I had the vegan cheese plate, it was like i died and went to heaven, so delicious.</text>

<text>If you ever want to go to one of these neo liberal places which are obliviously racist, this is where you go. I was there a few days ago and was consistently ignored and talked down to by the waitress. I should have spent my money elsewhere. If you're a person of color this is not a place for you, stay out.< /text>< pictures>

The food is fresh and flavorful.  I tried their Country Breakfast which had farm eggs, impossible sausage, rosemary hash browns, buttermilk biscuit all served with vegan butter and jelly.

Definitely recommend a try if you’re in the area.<//review>< Date>

Solid food, but slightly over priced. Our service was underwhelming and he was just looking to untie his apron and get out of there. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he had somewhere rad to get to so not fair to drop the overall rating. Net: food is good, but you'll be puzzled how ya spent so much.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The interior is full of greenery and is stylish.
I wonder if there were few kinds of dishes ...

I ordered acai and egg sandwich

緑に溢れた内装がお洒落です。
お料理の種類が少なかったかな…

アサイとタマゴサンドを頼みました< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The atmosphere is pretty good, but the price is high.
We think that it is place where person who wants to enjoy stylish place not to focus on cospa goes.
In Japan, it is like a cafe in Omotesando.
The hamburger was good but the pasta was not good.

(Original)
雰囲気はかなり良いですが、値段は高いです。
コスパ重視ではなく、おしゃれな場所を楽しみたい人が行く場所だと思います。
日本で言うと表参道のカフェのような場所です。
ハンバーガーは美味しかったですがパスタはいまいちでした。</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It was delicious with a healthy menu, but I feel a little expensive because I grew up in Japan where cospa is good and there are plenty of delicious foods.

The overall feeling of the store is wonderful. The staff is also very good for the United States. It may be just me, but I recommend something like rice in the photo.

I didn't know the name because I asked the neighbor to eat it.

(Original)
ヘルシーメニューで美味しかったですが、コスパが良くて美味しものが豊富な日本で育ったせいか、少し割高な気がします。

お店の全体感は素敵です。スタッフもアメリカにしてはテキパキしてます。僕の時だけかもしれませんが、、、写真のご飯みたいなものがオススメ。

隣の人が食べてたのを見て頼んだので名前がわからずで、、（笑）申し訳ないです。<//review>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) Ok the price is high but we went knowingly. Already the place is just beautiful, very nice staff, hyper pro, American! The toast has the avocado with the egg is just fabulous, gluten free option for me, respected, good to put a tip mandatory it's always weird for a French but when we are as delighted as we have been it's better !

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's ironic that a butcher girl has a vegetarian cafe. There were many people. It's quite rare because there aren't any people left in a relatively early time.

(Translated by Google) If you want a trendy place in Venice Beach, this is it: veggie and macramé, bohemian atmosphere and full room
Good 2 positive remarks: the decor is nice and the chef cooks great salads.
A little less well: it is not cheap and we are really a little tight and not very well seated!

<Review>(Translated by Google) It's overpriced!
The quantities are ridiculous and I did not feast. At 16 dollars the hamburger where we find 3 fries which fight in duel ... It does not make dream. Might as well take the impossible from burger king, at least there will be a drink and fries.
