This lab has become the worst lab I've ever dealt with in 17 years. Unbelievable

They do not communicate at all (unless it's to collect money). Their work is subpar. Partial dentures are terrible quality. They lose cases, don't call and then after two months they say we can make it again with the scanned models, then they call and say the case is lost. My local pizza joint is more efficient than this. They probably spend more money on their fancy catalogues than on their actual lab work. Terrible terrible business practice</Review>

<user_name>Sunrise Dental Marysville<//user_name><time>1583279343036< /time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>We have used this lab over the last 10 years.  Over the years quality of product and communication have gone down.  We use them for Dentures, Partials and Night Guards.  Night Guards are still the same quality, but Dentures and Partials are horrible.  Communication is the worst. Due dates are not being met even though we follow their schedule of how many days in lab are needed.  They do not call to notify us of cases being delayed. I'm certain that there is no quality check on products before being sent out.  We received a digital denture (which we did not request, it was supposed to be a traditional denture) with sharp serrated teeth (see attached pictures).  Partials not fitting even on the model sent with the case.  After two weeks of waiting on a case with no communication and the promise of "someone will call you today in regards to shipment and status of case" and no phone calls I will be finding a new lab.  Save yourself the trouble and use a different lab.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKyRe9jAItS-V6wOnmBCi1CzaZU2IDWS1Gtvp6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNW5ZjIP47vnJNkM9geFSB8o_icee8Zz5iscIq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWnpQFONuJ_fwT0-HC5QHJQjI3P83IdPr2QKx8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo8fcLwB_DyRyj9xFF0Uht9h8aaN25EFaZMgDj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4BywcgEnCtoU4HvzLRMOTYJQRcO2a4p4I3uRy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<text>Absolutely going down to the bottom of the barrel.  Have used them for many years but will be going elsewhere.  Have called about repeatedly about not getting the customization on crowns which was on the Rx and the product comes back without fabricating what I requested.  This happened 4 times. Was on hold today requesting to speak to a supervisor.  But after being on hold for 15 minutes , I decided to call back from another phone while on hold with the other.  When the person picked up the said that the would contact shipping while I waited.  After waiting 7 minutes,  I was told that I was going to get connected.  In a nutshell,  the case they said was sent back to them because Fed Ex tried to deliver it but we were closed. Funny though, because I was getting cases that I sent after but not this case.  They can't find the case. I told them to forget it and I think that they lost the case.  My patient was wondering what was going on.  Will go elsewhere. This is not the same Glidewell as can be seen from the other poor reviews.</text><Name>edward z<//Name></record>

I cannot be accused of slander, what follows is a matter of fact in the Dental Record. After you read this, you should not let your dentists source here.
My dentists sourced 4 crowns and 2 veneers from Glidewell. Before a year has gone by, all 6 had to be replaced, 3 of them needing 3 times replaced. And they are still the incorrect dimensions, except for the three I had replaced by a good manufacturer. Now, 2 implant crowns, after 3 remakes, are still the wrong dimensions (spaces between teeth, no excuse after Glidewell made these working from my mouth molds!!) leading to catastrophic implant failure from occlusal forces. The replacements will not be made by Glidewell. Sure, my dentist is culpable. The Board of Dentistry will deal with him, but Glidewell needs to be shut down.< /text>

<Text>I purchased the dreamTAP in May of 2019.  The so called "stronger than surgical stainless steel" hardware fractured in half.  Warranty only good for 6 months.  I purchased another dreamTAP in January of 2020 and it also broke in the same place.  And by the way don't even consider the EMA.  I had two of those too.  The bands stretch and are expensive.< /Text><Name>Cameron Rice</Name><Gmap_id>0x80dcde598e8dacf7:0x83727a5c354a2338<//Gmap_id><user>101350254405638957091</user>< pics>

Company had a good reputation for a long time. Decided to give them a shot along with our local lab who does good work, but has a long turn around time. The quality of the work I have gotten back has been very sub-par to average. I'm pretty sure the company has gotten so big that they don't really care anymore. More of that corporate mentality.</Text>

<review>Terrible experience. They were very uncaring. First, after spending a large amount of money and specifically giving instructions, their products crack and break. Not just once but repeatedly. Next, upon asking for other things and being willing to pay their listed price, they refused to work with me to obtain them. They were very uncooperative. Their products break! Their service is terrible!
It seemed like they want initial money but then do not provide basic service. They acted like the giant and had no interest in providing me necessary service, even when I was willing to pay for. Think twice before working with them.
I obviously was not big enough for them to care about. All they needed to do was let me buy accessories but they refused to care about me. It was a terrible and lengthy experience that was unnecessary.
If I were you I would avoid working with Glidewell. I sure regret working with them.</review>< Pictures>

Worst customer service and lab work since COVID. I get it we are all running on limited resources and short handed, but they are compromising patient care. I’m very disappointed because we had been using them for a while with no issues. Hopefully they can get back to their former level. 🤞🏻<//Review>

I've used this lab for 10 + years and finally given up. Quality has been declining every year and same mistakes were being made despite visiting the lab and reviewing the cases with the tech/supervisors. Cases still came back with poor results and remade. Case evaluations are joke. Don't think anyone reviews them.  Lab made temps. are worse and not fitting compared to chairside temps. Dentures NEVER fit. Being loyal to this lab only gave me headaches, patients' complaints, and a bigger hole in my wallet. Stay Away! despite the nice photos they spend money on instead of elevating the quality and customer services.<//text>

<Text>We have been customers of Glidewell for 20 yrs, but no more.  Lately, the work has been awful, the customer service worse.  I just called today to ask for help with sending a ceric case to them by email and was told after a long wait on hold that I would need to contact who ever sold me our ceric machine.  I called another lab who quickly help me and now will have all our business in the future.  It is sad what has happened to this lab.

<Text>Terrible Terrible Terrible Lab -

I am a dentist practicing in Illinois. I have not had this many issues with a single lab. They should get an award for Most Unorganized Business.

1. They have straight out lost my cases.
2. They have sent incorrect cases back - meaning cases for patients not even in my office!
3. They have hung up on me while I am on hold.
4. They have forgotten to contact me regarding work (which I have written out on the lab prescription form).

Will not be using them again. They have embarrassed my practice enough times.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I have been using this lab for some of my cases for years.  When I receive the bill from the case box I pay it then.  Often we are paid in full without receiving a monthly statement.  If I receive a statement, I match up receipts and have always paid my bill.  We received a case last week and I as usual I paid the bill right then.  Two days ago I receive a statement stating we owe $245 for 60 days ago.  I wrote the check and mail it in that day.  Today I was expecting to receive 2 cases.  My office manager spoke with a Jessica in Accounting that states she sees we paid a January bill but owe them for the past work.  My office manager tells Jessica the doctor sent in the check two days ago so should be received soon.  We are told unless we pay the Fed Ex delivery driver as COD our cases will not be handed over.  I was forced to write a check for $402 to include a case that we have not even received as of today.   So my patient cases are held hostage over $245 when I have a 9 year history of payments without any problems and they even see I just paid January before the statement was sent.  It was embarrassing in front of the staff and our patients that witnessed the delivery and demands for payment.  When I called to speak to a manager about why would they make this decision over $245 due from 60 days ago I was told I could not speak to a manager but would have to leave a message for accounting.  As of yet---they have not called me back.  Overall, I felt insulted and in the future will send my business to hopefully a business that cares more about those who have been with them for years and have never not paid for services they received.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Horrible company whom constantly gives you the run around.  Serial number of device provided and they still cannot determine what kind of customer satisfaction warranty is provided with the device.  So in reality there is absolutely no warranty if the device does not work for the patient thus leaving patients to foot the bill on not only one devices they can't use, but a second device with a different manufacturer that actually works.  Poor customer experience.  Shoddy company practice.  Big waste of time and money for those fitted with these appliances whom turn out to have allergic reactions.< /Review>

This  lab  has  been PHENOMENAL  since  the  day I started  using  them over 10 years  ago... Best consistent quality of appliances,/crowns, communication , fees  and  timeliness.  They  score  an A++++  from me .It is  no wonder  they are the  largest lab in the United  States.< /review>

but Glidewell Lab is not offering  Any Price Discount they simply dont care. we are near newyork area, Hard hit Areas.
Glidewell lab Supervisor informed GLIDEWELL DOES NOT CARE ABOUT COVID , we are simply open, with full profit margin.

we will be doing our business with real american companies that care. we have 2 accounts with them we are pulling them, this is the most un patriotic act in the time of need.
This is the kind of NON Caring attitude, that got us in this mess to begin with!</Review></record>

Don't send your cases here unless you want them to loose your case. I had a patient leave my practice because they lost the her case. Then it happened again 2 weeks later to another patient. Now i have to write a refund to the patient because she had another dental office make her one. This is absolutely ridiculous to loose a case.<//review>

Worst lab ever!!! I've had so many problems with Glidewell!  They sent me a broken bridge back, they forgot to send me an abutment with the case, not just once but twice.  When I called back, they had no response.  The fit and occlusion are completely off for all my cases.  I have to adjust all the crowns and the esthetics are sub par. Customer service is terrible. So glad I stopped using them!! Best decision I have made so far!  Please don't use them, it will save your patients.

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Worst dental lab customer service.  I can't tell you how many patients I've have lost since using this lab.  They consistently promise things they can not delivery on.  Their so called customer service managers don't even follow through.  It's a huge problem throughout the entire company.  Bad culture from the top down.  They send restorations that have not been changed when they were sent back specifically for an issue to be addressed.  Their technicians make decisions on restorations that impact patients well being with out getting doctor approval.  DO NOT USE THIS LAB, THERE ARE MANY OTHER CHOICES.

<review>Good service, professional, fair pricing.

As with any lab, you will have the occasional case where something goes wrong.  In my opinion, this is RARELY the fault of the lab and often the fault of the material, the shipper, the technique, or the dentist.  Ultimately, if you cement the case (dentist), you take responsibility.  Some of the work I have seen on these reviews speaks more about the quality of the dentist than the lab.  If your dentist was willing to cement or deliver something that you did not like (and then blame the lab) -- then the problem is your dentist.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1552085716401, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review - we appreciate the excellent dentists that we get to serve each day.'}< /Response>< GmapID>

Not recommended. We have had more issues with them than any other lab. They have horrendous customer service. They don't call us when cases will not arrive on time. This has happened more times that I can count, resulting in us having to reschedule patients last minute. That is not fair to us, nor to our patient's. Patient's take time off work and rearrange their schedules to make sure they can be here for their appointment. So you can see that by the lab not caring, or as in the representative's words "being too busy with other cases/people that they can't call everybody", causes a huge upset. Not only for us, but for our patient's. They are extremely unprofessional and I am more than disappointed in how they have handled our issues.  They preach "oh 1 week turn around time for crowns", but then when we call to see where the case is, it will be yet another few days-a week until the case is here. How is that a one week turn around time? Such a disappointment.< /Text>

For digitally planned CAD/CAM restorations and implant restorations, they have been performing very well for us.  Contacts and occlusion are usually spot-on with very little, if any, adjustment required.  Nobody bats a thousand, and we've had to send an occasional case back, but overall very pleased.  I know that reviews for traditional VPS impressions and C/B fabrication are mixed, but we are quite pleased with the digital workflow and outcome.<//Review>

< Review>
The experience with this dental laboratory was horrible. My dentist ordered a high noble  PFM crown however, they sent the wrong item out.  Then a second crown was made which chipped during my dental procedure. This incident ruined my relations with a dentist. The bad crown had to be removed and the entire procedure had to be redone. The crown was poorly fabricated and manufactured. Glidewell lab wrote a letter apologizing for the defective crown. I believe  the quality and integrity of their dental work is less than desirable.</Review>

Just like other reviews have stated, this lab has way too many individuals with too little experience, organization, and POOR QUALITY CONTROL parameters in place to give you a quality product.  I am so sad and tired of having to apologize to my patients about their ill-fitting crown with extra tight contacts, high occlusion, and open margins, and explaining why we will need to reschedule them for a 4th crown seat visit.  After hours on the phone asking Glidewell if I could speak with someone who is over all of their fixed departments so we can get this corrected with one phone call to one person instead of many phone calls to each department individually, and a new person every time having to retell my story to (taking more of my precious time) I could never get that to happen.  I also could not even get to the top of any individual department.  We have a digital scanner.... supposed to be more accurate than an impression, and I have excellent hand skills with good crown preps, but magically somehow our crowns have open margins, etc....  Enough is enough.  Back to a local lab, even though it's going to cost us more in lab bills, it's better than having a patient return 4 times for 1 crown seat.   Yes I am the doctor here writing this review.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I have worked with Glidewell Laboratories for at least 15 years. They are very well organized, efficient, cost-effective and produce very high quality restorations. Their customer service is second to none and they have a very knowledgeable staff.

Absolutely horrible customer service and poor product quality.  Their crowns and abutments failed on two implants.  I had to return to my dentist for numerous molds.  When I finally was scheduled for the “final” fitting in Chicago of the two failed and two new - Glidewell  failed to send two screws and the two they did send were the wrong size.  Accountability?  Forget it!   No apology for the inconvenience, no adjustments in price, just left my Denist to make apologies.   My time, her time, was a complete waste.  Time wasted with the failure, repeated molds, poor product.  I am scheduled for yet another visit to correct.  If, after four implants at a total cost, less wasted time, of nearly $25k, any of the four fail again, I will confer with an attorney to seek damages I could donate to a worthy Veterans cause.   I almost hope for another Glidewell failure.  The reviews I’m seeing on them make me wonder about their licensing.</text>

I have used them for my sleep appliances and posterior implant crowns for several years now with fantastic success.  The product is top notch, customer service has always been great, and they are very high-tech and innovative.  I have been using them to make my posterior crowns for natural teeth using my Cerec scans for the last few months and the fit and margins are incredibly accurate.  I never write reviews, but my experience has been great. I'm not sure why all of the negative reviews.<//text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>Just a word of advice to the patients who are leaving, especially low, ratings and comments.  Your dentists can tell you many things, but ultimately, the DENTIST is responsible for the quality of care, and if the lab doesn't provide it, they are at fault, not the lab.  I saw a patient posted a picture of something not clinically acceptable and blamed Glidewell.  Trust me, the dentist is the one who should be correcting this, and my experience is that Glidewell will be happy to work WITH him or her to do that.  Glidewell, like any dental lab, is a partner with the dentist.  The dentist can't blame them for every clinical problem they have.  There are probably 1000's of good labs they could use if they think Glidewell is not clinically acceptable, which it generally is.  Patients, communicate with YOUR DENTIST, don't blame the lab.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Time>1524152925085< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>Terrible, terrible, incompetent lab. They have lost numerous final impressions we have sent them and then accuse my staff of not sending them the final, or attempting to blame FedEx on losing the final impression (but admitting that the sealed box was delivered to their facility). They have regularly altered final impressions in the area of soft tissue (especially with bridges), thinking that they know better. Of course, on seat date, the case is grossly inaccurate and needs to be returned to be remade.
If you want inconsistency, no accountability, low quality and poor customer service, please choose Glidewell. We would give zero stars if we could.</text>< pics>

If I could give this lab no stars I would.  I manage a dental office in Dallas and I have never worked with a more unorganized dental lab.  WE CONTINUALLY have problems.  We have a digital scanner in our office and crowns still don't fit.  We have to send crowns back MULTIPLE times.  Sometimes seeing the patient 4 or 5 times to seat.  Anytime we call to speak to a supervisor we are told that they will call us back.  I am currently waiting on calls back for 6 patients.  I have NOT spoken to or received a phone call from a supervisor or anyone else from the lab.  We were told cases would be here at certain times and they don't show up.  Numerous times we were told "the case is just sitting in shipping" or "the case hasn't been started" or "we had to order a part and it wont be in for 2 weeks".  Their customer service is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have absolutely nothing good or nice to say about this dental lab.< /review>

I have worked with Glidewell on and off for years.  Recently we purchased a 3M Trudefinition scanner and working with Glidewell has become amazing.  Bites are great, contacts great, shade great, PRICE great, turnaround great.  Sadly, the mom and pop lab I've worked with can't compete anymore.  Good customer service....know what they're doing.<//review>

I have had very positive experiences with Glidewell.  Customer service is great and if anything needs to be replaced or sent back to the lab, they never give you grief about it.  Also, they help to educate dentists with their Chairside Live online videos.  As a young dentist, I think they are a solid lab.  Not sure about full mouth recon stuff, I have never used them for that, but as far as a good, solid lab that has a consistent product, I like them</Text>

< Review>
I have been using this lab for a few years now and seems like they are getting more and more disorganized,arrogant, and their customer service attitude is if you don't like us, go elsewhere. They have sent me back cases without the right crown, or in the latest case, made me a cement-retained crown, where I had specifically ordered a screw retained ceramic crown.  And when I complained,  the supervisor pretty much told me that it was my fault for checking a wrong box on the order form, even though I had clearly written down what I wanted.

In my opinion, they are just getting too big to worry about loosing a few customers when their lab screws up a case or two. I will be sending my cases to local labs that will do a much higher quality of work than I can expect from Glidewell.< /Review>

This is not my profession so the suggestion was just assinine.  I started with implants and crowns in Sept of 2014 and still not completed as of yet.  Now permanent crowns have been installed and they are crooked, uneven and I have a horrible bite.  Cannot eat like normal people....since I have to tear my food rather than bite it.

<Review>I’ve been working with Glidewell for years and have worked with numerous other labs too, but Glidewell’s consistency, precision, and accessibility keeps me coming back.

Yes they may lose an impression once or twice, but it really is not the lab’s fault if you as a patient has had a bad experience or result. It is ultimately the dentist’s job to accurately transfer your dental and anatomical structures to the lab - all through a simple “mold” - so that he lab may fabricate accurate and esthetic prostheses. Also, when a case is received, it is the dentist’s job to inspect the quality of the prosthesis before the patient even comes in, and to check inside the patients mouth again and make adjustments as needed or send back to the lab if the patient is not 100% satisfied. The lab can only do as well as the dentist does. I’ve physically visited some local labs and I’ve seen a wide variety of styles and skills of dentists’ impressions and transfer methods. Not every dentist out there is a rockstar perfectionist, but at least they all can try to be one. If you are not happy with the results- you should consult your concerns with your dentist to rectify what’s needed to be fixed.

Anywho, I personally haven’t had any clinical issues with Glidewell (so far) and I hope it continues to stay that way. Their website’s “myaccount” feature is so convenient for people like myself who dont like to make phone calls haha.

Also, i study on my spare time everyday to learn the newest and most accurate techniques of capturing my patients’ oral structures along with its relation to the whole face in order to provide the most accurate and long-lasting results possible clinically and esthetically. My point is that every dentist should be doing that- and that is why we all pay thousands of dollars just on CE courses!Oftentimes I find myself consulting information provided by Glidewell. It just makes it so much easier to know what THEY prefer, so I can accurately record all the necessary information of a patient when he or she is in the office. What other dental lab does that!? IMO there are some not so great dentists out there, but glidewell really tries to help the clinician complete cases quickly and easily. Keep up the great work!

P.S. Their new BruxZir HT (esthetic) ~850mPa is great! Its basically like EMax but twice as strong! Anterior Emax + Posterior BruxZir HT = Happy Patient !!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Ok I've worked with MANY labs before and glidewell has been the most consistent with their delivery, support and customer service. It's not easy to run such massive organization with the level of service they're providing. I'd like to thank Clary from the removable department for being such amazing help. GO GDL!< /Text>

<text>This is the absolute worst dental lab we have ever used! They can never get a case back on time, they never call to tell you it won't be there, they act as if you are being abrasive when you ask a lot of questions or imply that they dropped the ball. We have lost so much money and time because of this lab. We are constantly having to give our patients discounts to make up for how long they had to wait and for all the times there appointments were moved and rescheduled. This lab is horrible! Don't waste your time or money.

<text>You get what you pay for. This lab is terribly unorganized. There are WAY too many people working there with extremely different degrees of understanding and ability. Communication between departments is very poor. There are very nice customer service people but unfortunately useless when it comes to taking action and helping get the result you're looking for. I'm a prosthodontist and I have had a wide variety of experience with different restorations the from implant crown, to implant supported prosthesis, and RPDs. RPD's are unfortunately the worst unless it's an extremely straight forward case. Implant supported prosthesis will make you absolutely insane in terms of the lab NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS. They simply don't. After a series of mistakes I went to a local lab and coordinated the set up for an all on 4 case on the upper arch. After so much back and forth with the patient we finally got her to say OMG I LOVE THE SET- up. I sent the case in and asked to have it color matched to the denture teeth (which is not always possible with PMMA) it was supposed to be a B1 or at least A1 and I received a milled framework in D4! I mean WAY OFF with NO time to do anything but sit there and be embarrassed again. This is my fault for going with them but it was only because of the cost.

This is a small part of all the mistakes and mishaps, broken casts returned in boxes, calls about cases that were not even from our office, mix ups in shipping and delivery dates, the list just goes on and on. Finally, I called and asked to talk to a manager. Someone picked up and was very polite but was obviously distracted and was not listening to what I was saying at all. All the mean while completely contradicting what his previous "manager" had said. The lab markets very very well and they have the ability to crush smaller labs in terms of the cost but you will end up looking very silly in front of your patients. I have learned a very valuable lesson. Charge a little more and go with a good lab that coordinates, communicates and follow's instructions.< /text><user_id>101494541178880371364< /user_id>< Time>

Unreliable. Spoke with 4 different people about a case, they all guarantee on-time delivery. The case was never shipped, they seen to care less about the urgency of the situation. Very disappointing.</review>

<Time>1377705218846< /Time><text>In 2012, I made a full maxillary denture assisted by three implants for an elderly female patient.

To make a long story short, she had an allergic reaction to the acrylic.

After testing with several materials, we found that she was able to tolerate the vinyl material Astron. The prosthetic lab that I normally use did not offer Astron, and I found that Glidewell did use the material and could rebase the patient's denture.

We made the impressions and records that Glidewell required. We delivered the denture to the patient and scheduled in a couple of weeks to check the denture, and it became obvious that she was again reacting to the material. When questioned, Glidewell was vague as to whether Astron was even used in the denture.

Again we retested the patient's allergy with a sample, and found that Astron was tolerated. We tried to discuss the problem with Glidewell personnel, and were directed to a different individual each time we called.

After all of this, we again made the impressions and records, and I wrote very explicit laboratory instructions stating that the denture needed to be rebased with the Astron material. When the denture was returned, it was obvious that it had not been rebased, but relined.

We called, again speaking to an entirely different person. After checking and returning our call, they couldn't assure us that they had done a rebase as we had directed, and also could not assure us as to whether or not Astron material had even been used!

I can honestly say that in my forty plus years of practice I have never dealt with such incompetence.

Glidewell ignored my laboratory prescriptions, was difficult to communicate with, and most importantly, caused a lot of discomfort and wasted time on the part of my patient.

<review>This was a great location for a large group. It was easy to walk your stuff down to the water for the lake day. The site was very sunny however because of so many dying tree that have been removed. It is not feasible to be in your tent during the day.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

They charged the church $315.00 for the site and charged $10.00 per car parking. I think it was a little high for the site and parking too?<//Text>

< Review>
Way better than Crepevine, and the owner is actually from France, super authentic. They have three different batters: one for sweet, one for savory, one one that is gluten free. The ingredients are all very fresh. They’ve nailed the flavors from different regions, like the Bangkok sauce is something that cannot be replicated by anyone other than them. Family owned and operated with amazing service. They should bring back the really really nice Chinese girl though who made the best fluffy cappuccinos 😂< /Review>

Unpretentious, quick service, no frills. Small place with limited seating. Not really a table service place but very good food. Crepes are very large so plan on some sharing.</review>

Skip the "Oslo" crepe, the salmon is just overly salty. The sweet one with raspberries is yummy. I think this place has the fastest WiFi speed of all cafes in the East Bay...

Cute little hole in the wall that serves savory and sweet crepes, coffee and a few other odds and ends. The crepes are pretty good and include inventive combinations of veggies, cheese and meats. They will make you a buckwheat crepe (gluten free) on request. It's very small and relatively quiet. There is street parking only.</Text>

< Review>
Was there recently on Sunday at around 12:30, perhaps their busiest time of the week.  I ordered an Oslo crepe that was supposed to have smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and capers.  After waiting what seemed like a long time, I received my order.  I'll give them a pass on the time because there were 2 guys making crepes as fast as they could on a busy Sunday brunch rush, but I won't excuse the fact that there were no capers in my crepe.  If they had run out, someone should have let me know.  It may be that they were just forgotten.  I don't know.  But it was advertised so there's no good excuse.<//Review>

One of our favorite places for breakfast or lunch on Solano.

Owned by a friendly family from France, cafe offers excellent selection of crepes, fresh squeezed orange juice, cappuccino and other drinks. Menu is highly customizable so you can ask for a crepe of your dreams and will not be disappointed.

If you like European style places, check them out!<//Review>

Crepes were good (although they should really pick a different flour for their gluten free crepes). Took longer than I would have expected.</text>

<review>Went to another place on trip advisor and it had shut down so I was starving for some eating. Asked the lady at the art store on the corner where I can get some grub for my tum and she pointed me in the direction of this delicious joint. Walked down the street, walked in, ordered my food, and had an amazing crepe sitting in front of me. It was delicious, sauce was some weird awesomeness that was made by angels. It's cute, small, and has big flavor. Loved it and hope everyone else gets a chance to stop in here if you're in albany.< /review>< Pics>

I love the Bangkok crepe; Thai spicy deliciousness ! The lemon crepe is also lovely, and if you ask they'll add vanilla ice cream for $1. And they are always kind to my very talkative son. :-)</Review>

<Review>I don’t know why people were saying that it’s not open 24/7. I just came in this morning at 5:30am and I was greeted with a very nice man who provided great service. Not to mention, this gas is the cheapest around and they only charge a one time fee of $0.35 when you use a card to pay, unlike other gas stations where they charge you a certain amount every gallon.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>This location gets busy during the day then if you are heading to the freeway is a bit harder, instead get gas early am or late pm, no traffic then.

Gas is cheaper if you pay cash, good customer service and good hot chocolate for a cold evening.<//Text>< pictures>

I've patronized this business for eight years. In the early morning hours of March 30, 2018, I stopped by to purchase gasoline. When I attempted to use the men's bathroom, it was locked. Couldn't understand why it was locked when I was the only patronized on the premises.

The sales clerk told me that the manager took the keys to the bathrooms with her and that the bathrooms were no longer available to customers. The ARCO employee went on to tell me that the policy had been enacted two-weeks earlier.

I will buy my gasoline from another location from now on.< /Text>

Sometimes Arco can have a funny smell when you walk into it don't know what it is and must be the type of cleaner that they use while cleaning the floors but he said they just need to run in and pay for gas and maybe grab a snack and then you're good to go if you're looking to pay the lower prices this Arco is one of the lower price gas stations I've been to other than the smell it was okay gas station<//Review>

(Translated by Google) They don't accept credit cards, debit cards only work locally. Very poor service. In the 21st century, no card support is left without a comment. I do not recommend tourists.

(Original)
Nie akceptują kart kredytowych, debetowe działają tylko lokalne. Bardzo słaba obsługa. W 21 wieku brak obsługi kart pozostawiam bez komentarza. Turystom nie polecam.<//Text>

I decided to try this gym since it was the only one open during this pandemic.  It gets very crowded, even with the Covid-19 restrictions which aren't strongly enforced.  I often see people take masks off, or have nose or mouth exposed while using equipment.  Most people do not bother wiping down the equipment, either.  Do not get pressured to do their personal training!  It is too expensive, like $100 an hour!  I turned in my cancellation within the 5th day as the contract stated I could, but Manager Joseph claimed I was too late because he didn't receive it until after.  He is not easy to contact either.  I should have fought it legally.  The training was okay, but I didn't really learn much, and he was often late for my appointments.  I prepaid a year for my membership to save money, but lost the savings with the overpriced training.  When my membership ends in November I am definitely going back to my former gym, Planet Fitness, because they handle things more professionally.  They even paused my dues until I come back in November!< /Text>

Seems Scammy? They charge you for guest privileges you can't use?One would think a *honest company would stop charging you* if you are not allowed to bring a guest during the week.Don't even want to try this gym.< /Review>

They deserve 0 stars. Do not trust this place with your personal or billing info. I canceled 3 years ago for legitimate reasons. They continued to charge me UNAUTHORIZED but coincidently decided to stop charging once I got my bank involved. Fast forward to earlier this week & I'm receiving texts saying I'll be sent to collections if I dont pay up to the end of this month. I call the gym & they say I'm all good. Ya, I know I'm good. So if this is the clever sales tactic they use to get you to call their gym & sign up again, they shouldn't expect a very kind response. Only sign up if you want their harassment services. Thay are not professional at all and you'll forever have problems. You might be happy now as members, but remember this when you try to cancel that s***</Text>

While living in Wildomar, CA, this was my home gym. I moved away but still keep my membership here. I love their friendliness and great customer support. Charlie (I hope I spelt her name right) is the assistant manager and she is great at helping any situation and finding solutions.< /text>

This gym is a gem! The staff are very friendly and helpful. My personal interaction With Robert (The general manager)was more of the same. The gym has something for everyone. Great equipment, clean environment and not overly crowded. If you want to good deal on a good gym you’re in the right place!<//Review>

< Review>
I have always made yoga or cardio as part of my exercise routine.  However, after several months of Covid-19 shut down my body became pretty sluggish and I felt tired and weak.  Once the shutdown was lifted I joined the local gym “Crunch Fitness” in Murrieta, for cardio workouts and also because the monthly dues were a lot less than yoga monthly dues.  And to kick start my body back to health I signed up with a trainer for strength training.  WOW!!!  What a difference working with a trainer!!!  The professional knowledge, expertise and guidance I received from Joseph and Andrew (my trainer) has been a total game changer.  I’m 61 yrs old and have never really done any strength training.  I’ve tried on my own before but never really saw the results I’d like.  But the spot on training I receive with Andrew at Crunch Fitness in Murrieta has strengthened my body and I can already see the physical changes, and it’s only been two weeks!!!  After each session I leave the gym feeling stronger and happier.  This was by far the best investment for my health and well-being!!
I recommend Crunch Fitness in Murrieta 100%.  Invest in yourself today!!  You’re gonna love it!!

Great staff, they actually take the time to welcome you each day.  They are getting pretty crowded with them being one of the few gyms open but kudos to them for being brave enough to stand up to Newsome.< /Review>

I was offered the option of jotting down all of my information first and later either confirm that I wanted to join or decline. I was told that I would not be charged unless I confirmed later on that I indeed wanted to join. A week later I received a call from them, at which point I told them I did not want to join the gym and to please shred all of my information. Instead, they charged my card the next day, showing complete disregard for my request to specifically shred the information I gave them in the case I wanted to join (I will not be jointing any Crunch after this). Crunch Murrieta cannot be trusted with personal information, so be careful when you go in there<//review>

Called to confirm I could sign up for a guest pass and come in. Signed up online, brought in my email with the guest pass, and after driving over was told that they’re not accepting guess passes at this time but if I paid $80 I could get a membership.

Shady sales tactics that wasted my time<//Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I had an unprofessional experience with Leanne at the front desk at Crunch Murrieta around 11:30 AM. While trying to scan in she rolled her eyes and began making faces with her coworker even beginning to laugh which was really odd. I ignored it, thinking maybe It she didn’t mean it towards me but as I tried to continue to my workout but she stopped me and said there was a mix up with my account. I am aware mixups happen but the aggressive way she told me to stop actually surprised and embarrassed me as many people began looking over. She had claimed that I was not a member which was untrue. Throughout the whole interaction she was very hostile and she interacted with a lot of attitude. I never once gave the same the same attitude back and typically have good interactions with the staff but the amount of attitude, judgement and unprofessionalism was too much to not write a review. The other employee actually stepped in after she saw her coworkers interactions with me and there was NO problems with my membership. I encourage management to look into her because i am sure this isn’t the first case.< /text>< Pics>

<review>My first gym membership since moving to the US from the UK. Basic and simple. Good starter gym. Friendly staff. Good deals. Water massage bed and sun tanning booths. Good monthly prices and good choice of classes available. Never gets too busy. For those from the UK, this is the same as you would get at The Gym, but Crunch has proper classes which is a nice extra. Enjoying working out here. Would recommend for a good priced mainstream gym.</review>< Pics>

I was very interested in trying out Crunch Fitness, until I checked their pricing. They advertise being as low as 50¢ a day, however they love to tack on extra charges. YOU need to pay THEM an additional $20 for THEM to process YOUR enrollment. “Thank you for your business, now pay us more if you want us to accept your enrollment and add it to the system”. They also charge a $10 processing fee for who-knows-what 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a tip jar on the front desk, and a tip jar on all the water fountains</Text>

<Text>So, now they've taken away the paper towels and disinfecting spray from the gym floor. They have been replaced with sanitary wipes. I was told this was because the PAYING customers misuse the paper towels. Really??!! I'm not sure how one does that OR how one is suppose to blow their nose with a sanitary wipe OR dry a piece of equipment after cleaning it with a sanitary wipe, when there are no paper towels. Are we children? Is our patronage even appreciated? Doesn't seem like it.  :( Lastly, paper towels are biodegradable, sanitary wipes can take up to 100 years to decompose. Not so good for the environment…..more sad face   :(

Thank you for your response Nic, but I do not see using my portable towel with my sweat on it as a viable option.< /Text>< Resp>

As a means of ensuring our equipment remains disinfected and for ease of use for members we've taken to utilizing sanitary wipes as opposed to paper towels and a sanitation solution (that of which renders the paper towels as non-biodegradable). We recommend a portable towel to dry thereafter as well!\n\nIf you have any additional questions/concerns we'd greatly appreciate your follow up by emailing manager@crunchmurrieta.com"}</Resp>

< Review>
This place is a little smaller than some of the other big chain clubs, but the prices are a lot better, and they still have all the equipment you could want. This location in particular is a lot busier after work hours than other place, but I'm still able to get a full workout in (warm up, weight training, and 30 minutes of cardio) in an hour and a half.

Facilities are pretty nice and new, but they do have some problems in the men's bathroom with the toilets leaking on the floor. Also, when things go down, they don't get fixed very quickly. I've been going here for a couple of months now, and the water bottle refill station that said it was out if order when I started is still out of order, and the shower stall in the men's that was down took like a month to fix.

Overall, it's a nice gym for price. They have a few extra things like tanning and hydro massage, and some 3D fitness modeler that I'm not sure exactly what it does (maybe shows you what you look like in better shape?). They have group classes and personal training just like every other gym. I'd say if they fixed things at a more reasonable rate it would be 5 star.< /Review>

Decent gym with decent hours and I'd say on the better end of equipment. However, there is a group of people that go in every night (We all see that guy in the same track suit every night with his group of lackies behind him). Who harasses gym goers, hogs equipment, slams weights (my ears ring through my headphones) and are overall obnoxious. For example, this group of people decided to take up all squat/deadlifting platforms/AND benches (there were like 6 in total) just to curl. At the same time. Leaving them unavailable for anyone else. There needs to be rules in place for misuse of equipment like this. The guy in the tracksuit needs to be dealt with, no one likes him.<//Review>

I will be canceling though.  We signed up a few months ago and the guy who signed us up told us we would be able to do this or that use the tanning and massage and special weight scale they have. He doesn't work there anymore and now they want me to upgrade to use the extra No thanks. Other than that it's a clean place I give them that< /Review>< Pics>

I am very satisfied with this gym. They provided a great deal for us when our gym ‘you-fit’ closed unexpectedly. The staff is very nice and the general manager was accommodating. I will definitely recommend ‘crunch’ to all of my friends and family.</text>

Often they open late ( up to 1 hour) which ruins my daily schedule. When the machines break it take many days before they get repaired.  The music that they play is god awful. They play it loud to so It’s hard to listen to good music with ear buds.</review>

Decent gym but mismanaged. There needs to be an adult manager on-site at all times to watch the kids that work here. My biggest qualms are:
1. Despite that nearly everyone here has on headphones/ear buds and is listening to their own music, the gals at the front desk like to blare music. I can barely hear my music with my headphones on. Today she is blasting Mexican music. I feel like I'm at a party in Tijuana. Why? Why not play the music softly so we can enjoy what we want to listen to.
2. They need employees to walk around more frequently to put equipment away and to enforce that members put things away, where they belong.<//text>

I have been going to gyms all of my life and this is the worst by far. The front desk people are incompetent and they do not even care. I went in they could not even give me a body percentage test because the Machine was broken. The music is horindous in there and they actually billed my account after I canceled and now I am still waiting for my 9.95.i keep getting the run around. Super non business friendly. 0 stars< /Review>

<Review>One of a few places, who offer bumper plates and platforms for people who actually workout. Has a selection of kettlebells and foam rollers. Doesn't  waste all their money on wasteful cardio or pulley machines, like L.A fitness or 24 hour fitness does.

< Review>
Guys are nice, work fast, and definitely know what they are doing. Tried to install at home and couldn't get the stereo on at all. Thought it was an electrical issue. It wasn't, they knew what to connect where with no problem. In and out in less than 40 minutes. Definitely recommend.</Review>

<review>HONEST and PROFESSIONAL 💯 I am a REPEAT customer. I came here to get a new radio for my car and Tom and his team helped to empower me with education and choice so I can make the perfect decision to match my audio needs. I recently bought an RV and came back to put in a sub woofer that SOUNDS BANGING ! Love these folks at streamline , CANNOT RECCOMEND MORE ! BRING YOUR CAR IN NOW 👍<//review>< Rating>

Be aware this place will take advantage of you,they give you a specific price for installation and find a petty excuse to raise price once they take your interior apart,which takes long hours...They will also connect your stereo with only one RCA plug so your stereo will not be as loud hoping you buy more extra exspensive products from them.Also save all receipts this place does not keep records, regardless if you use a credit/debit card to pay,they will not honor the Warranty time line...<//text>

<Text>The add on their wall says free installation. I asked how much for the car alarm.they said 99$ starting. Then they said its 167.00 with installation. I told them they have a huge window painting that says FREE installation. Then the guy stays quiet and says its only for radios even dough it says in big words..ALARM. Sounds like someone wanted lunch money.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I paid $75 for HID headlights. A year latter the right lightbulbs blew out so they charge me $50 for a new set because they did not have the same color of the old pair. Ok so then 2 months latter the RIGHT conversion kit box ended burn out so then he wanted to charge me another $35 for a new kit. They try to husttle you for their crapy jobs that they dont install right in the first place.<//Text>

Correction to the previous post, that was overview of Desert Springs not desert in Cathedral City. As this Desert Sands MH park is lovely, expensive HOA the very well maintained and quiet. Please excuse the name confusion with the prior review referring to a Sky Valley mH/rv park.<//text>

<Text>Have had a storage unit here for a couple years now. . went to get in it on Memorial Day. . card didn't work. . OK. . .it was after hours and a holiday. . .my bad. . .went back the following Thursday at 3 in the afternoon. Went in and asked to check if my card was working. . the young man working (Juan I believe) had no idea how to help me. . gets the other young man (Austen) who tells me to try my card and if it doesn't work they can help (a lie) .so I drive around the building. . .guess what. . card doesn't work. . drive back around and they both are completely useless. . .Austen is too busy counting his register and talking about being off and Juan was clueless from the get go. I am told I just need to come back when the manager is working. . .WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!. . long story short I was unable to get my things from storage to go camping and had to purchase new because U-haul has new employees working alone who have no idea how to provide customer service. Very disappointed. . will be looking for a new storage unit ASAP.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x54d3fe25c2326c19:0xb776648bd9c0c901< /gmapID></record>

<date>1610134750622<//date><Rate>2</Rate><review>I have 2 complaints for U-Haul Moving & Storage of Eureka: If you buy something there you can't return it unless you have your receipt. I bought a trailer hitch pin but ended up not using it. I never used it or took it out of it packaging. The second complaint I have is the amount of time it took to get a propane tank filled. I waited over 30 minutes because there was only 1 employee on duty. He was a nice guy but he was trying to rent U-haul vehicles, answer the phone, sell store items, fill propane tanks, rent storerooms, etc.  Way too much work for 1 person.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x54d3fe25c2326c19:0xb776648bd9c0c901< /gmap_id></record>

My boyfriend reserved a storage unit here weeks in advance. The day we needed to get in, we get there and they "have nothing" for us. We showed them our reservation on THEIR website, and we weren't in their system at all. We didn't get a single call about our reservation being canceled or changed. Very displeased.</Review>

<Text>The staff at this location have been exceptionally wonderful. We came in several times just to ask questions and they were always helpful and friendly, no matter who we dealt with. They have gone above and beyond to make our experience as quick and easy as possible. They even carried our moving boxes to our truck for us. Thank you to all of the staff at the Jacobs​ Avenue, Eureka U-haul. You have changed my view of U-haul.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Emptied our 4 Uboxes on May 30, 2020. Got a bill for June storage of those boxes (which were EMPTIED and ready for reassignment). Manager refuses to return my calls and now I’m out $75.90 all because the manager won’t return my calls, refund me, or put in the correct return date (Brent put it in as June 2nd so I wouldn’t get billed for July).<//review>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Complete scammers.  They continue to take reviews down so people can't see that they are in desperate need of money and will fight you and lie to you about the gas. Also be careful if their ap isn't working when you go to pick up the vehicle they lie and make charges to you for gas they claim you used. Have pictures and receipts with times, dates, mile all accounted for. Very poor management and staff do not know what they are doing. Rude, arrogant and clearly need the money. I have never seen a company so desperate for 20.00 from their customers that they will go to any length  to get it. Scammer alert.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I would give zero stars if I could. Set up an appointment for a hitch install. Drove an hour and a half to get there for my appointment and guess what...they didn't have the hitch there to install. They never called, emailed or sent a text to tell me not to waste my time coming in.
Should have learned my lesson the first time Uhaul as a corporation screwed me over and not gone to them at all.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
Great employees, false advertising, shabby storage unit.

The staff is really helpful and gracious. Thank you, Ash-Lee for being so patient with me and helping me as much as you could!

A sticker inside the truck states, with no further details, the first month free on a storage unit with a one-way truck or trailer rental. Nowhere did it simply say "at participating locations only", when in fact that was the case, and I had to pay right away. I did, but I was bummed.

Not even two weeks later and I discovered evidence of mice all over my things. After I moved everything, I found two holes which the mice could get through, one had been worked at by chewing and scratching, the other was a gap in the design of the unit itself. There should have been an inspection of the unit prior to my move-in to avoid this even being a concern in the first place.<//Review>

After I signed all the papers and gave them the money ,they informed me that if ,at anytime, I forgot to scan my card when I come or go off the property that it would trigger an alarm which would cost me a $50 fee.
I decided to go ahead and rent the unit anyway.
every time I went to my storage unit , the alarm would go off  every time I opened and shut the door, even though I scanned the card.
Also,according to the assistant manager their “climate controlled units” mean : “
“the climate controls the temperature of the units”
This Place Sucks/ I got a refund and went somewhere else.< /review>

<gmap_id>0x54d3fe25c2326c19:0xb776648bd9c0c901</gmap_id><review>!!!!WARNING: HIDDEN COSTS!!!!
I ordered 2 Ubox containers to be delivered to my home and then shipped across country. I did extensive research to make sure I knew the exact cost of the move and could prepare for it, and got an email from Uhaul quoting me about $2,000 for shipping, the email did not mention a single other due amount of future cost of anything. I thought that was a total quote, and expected that if there were any other costs, Uhaul would at least have the curtesy to tell me or even include it in the quoted price. So to my surprise, on the day our containers were dropped off, the Uhaul employee says, “oh by the way, that’ll be $272 for drop off” and I was furious to be blindsided by extra costs that Uhaul didn’t even bother to explain or include in the original quote. They also did the same thing for drop off at the new location across country. My main issue is not having extra drop off costs, it’s a massive company taking advantage of people in stressful situations by neglecting to itemize each individual expense and telling its customers they owe extra amounts of money without making an effort to be upfront about ALL of the expenses. It is immoral and wrong Uhaul.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>2nd time I have been overcharged at this location.  First time I was charged $40 for a tow hitch or something ridiculous.  I had gone in there for boxes, tape, and packing paper.  I had to make a trip back to get a refund.  This time, I rented a truck as a temporary vehicle for my son's whose car was in the shop unexpectedly.  I was given a quote over the phone.  When the vehicle was picked up, they had tacked on $30 in insurance which I did not authorize.  I didn't see the charge until I got the receipt after it was all done and over with. They won't discuss with me because it's not my contract.  Yet I am the one that set it up and paid.  Absolutely the worst customer service ever!!!  And they are cheats as far as I can tell.<//Text>< Name>

called a week maybe a little over week, to reserve a 14' truck but the day i arrived they didn't have any, only the 25' ones. they need to inform customers that reservations aren't guaranteed, and need to figure out how they can begin guaranteeing this.  better off going to Budget Truck< /Review>

<Text>Went to get a propane bottle refilled today 2/19/18 and had horrible service. The staff was clueless on how to fill the bottle and were very rude ended up not even getting my bottle filled luckily the redwood coastal rv and cabin park had a filling station had no problems was in and out in ten minutes. Would not recommend the uhaul place at all unless you want to waist your time and fuel to go there and still get nothing done. After today's service I will never do any business with them.< /Text>< Pictures>

I called this U-Haul location this morning. They have yet to respond. The message on the voicemail recording indicates that they are open today. However, no one has responded to my request to rent one of their trucks today. Also, I would like to mention that this is the third time that I have tried to use their services but was forced to go with another location due to no response. Not happy with this location's customer service practices.< /Review>

I've rented several trailers from them over the last few years. Always returned them hours early. Called a head and let them know I was running a bit late. Dropped off the trailer 35 minutes late and they "had" to charge me for another 24 hours because the manager wouldn't authorize it.<//Review>

Great service on a rainy day.  Especially like the attention to detail adding a cardboard tray under our pizza to keep the box dry on our front porch.  Thanks for excellent service...Again!<//Review>

ok... so.... I placed my order online, delivery was going to take over an hr., so I said I'll p/u. it'll be 25min. I go to pick up and all is fine and I swiped my card with leaving a 10% tip.  Here's where it blew my mind.  They were charging me extra for crushed red pepper, plates and extra ranch and Buffalo wing sauce!!!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!!!    1 STAR for you DOMINOS for seriously charging your tip paying customers for necessities such as crushed peppers and plates.  SMDMFH<//Text>

If you're on a budget this is your best bet but it's basically fast food in burger form so there are far better options in town.< /review>

I really enjoy the Brooklyn style crust with their hearty marinara sauce. Dominos usually has coupons online that will save you some money. Great for some quick food when you don't feel like cooking.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I was working alone and could not get lunch. Decided to try pizza delivery.  Used a coupon online, custom ordered my pizza, got 12 pc specialty chicken, paid on-line and even included the tip so I needed no cash (thank goodness). Delivered faster than the email said it would arrive. To me, this was a life saver and I enjoyed my lunch.</Review>< name>

The people are so friendly, and the pizza was really good. I haven't been to a Domino's for awhile, but let me tell you, it's so much better. The menu is better the restaurant feels new and clean the service was impressive. I will definitely go back. Unlike some of their competitors, the prices were lower than I anticipated. The specials were things I'd actually want to eat. Overall, I was shocked at how much they have changed. By the way my pizza was Awesome!</Review>

Ordered a pizza and wings tonight and ended up receiving a pizza and bread twists which I didn't order. I usually don't do Domino's but I thought I should give them a try. I should have stick to Little Caesars.<//Text>

For years I ordered pizzas with the original crust and it was OK.  But then I discovered pan crust and it was awesome! Pan crust from now on! Also, their boneless chicken wings are spendy but always very good.<//Text>

Today was the 3rd time they had us waiting for a pizza we ordered 20 mins before arriving for an additional 30 mins & the pizza was never started. They continuously lie about how much time is left as if it’s already cooking, and then tell you it hasn’t even been started when you no longer have time to go anywhere else. Had to tell my husband to come home because I would’ve been late for work had I waited another 30 mins on top of the 30 we already waited since arriving. Very disappointed and feel like I can’t trust anyone who just lies over and over for no reason. 😒💁🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️< /Text>

I regularly order carry out here and never had any issues. I called and ordered on super bowl Sunday, didn't wait at all to order over the phone and my pizza was ready in 15 min. Everyone at home enjoyed the pizza.

Also, if you tip any driver only $1 you deserve less than disappearing bacon. If you can't tip more pick it up yourself or work as a pizza delivery man to afford to tip more and have some sympathy for drivers. If you don't like the way they're paid go to corporate.<//text>

The prices are great if you use their coupons... A little bit pricey for the quality of you don't use a coupon. But overall it's not much more than a little Cesar's pizza and it is much better quality... I would recommend them to my friends. Service was also very fast.<//text>

<Text>Almost always fast, friendly and delicious. If you order 6pm on Friday evening, OF COURSE it's going to take an hour. It's 6pm on Friday. Besides that, mostly nice delivery folks, usually super-quick, food is almost always great (still OK when it isn't great). 12 bucks for 2 pizzas is awesome.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

My only qualm I have is that the deep dishes I've received have been fairly flat, and the toppings have been sparce at times, and I would love to have the option of having anchovies on the side like most of the main pizza chains provide.

so decided to try this spot again after a very long time and they still suck .twice this week they tried to bring me old cold not so fresh pizza , they offered me a free pizza the "next time" i order but did not offer to replace the current one until i gave them a big stank about it . i turned it all away i will just order from papa johns or something and maybe try them again in a year or so just like last time . maybe they will start caring about quality and service in 2019< /review>

Used the dominoes app and it's pretty good. I like the live updates to what's a happenin' to my pizza. Have had 3 different delivery drivers and they've all been really nice and the pizza is good. Its dominos so it's pretty predictable and great price.< /Text>

<review>This place seemed promising when it first opened, but since then their quality of service and cleanliness has diminished.

Come on guys! We are back to greasy as heck pizza again. Also, it would have been nice if the pizza was cut so we didn't have to do it at home. This location seems to yo-yo between good and bad, depending on who is working there at the time. I am going to leave my rating at 3 stars (right in the middle) because they don't seem to have the special stuff all the time.

01/31/2020
Who says businesses don't listen to reviews? This Domino's has greatly improved from my previous review where I gave them 2 stars. I have changed my review to 4 stars because of the improvements.

Original Review
This is specific to this Dominos. The first time I ate their pizza, I got nausea. The second time, there was so much greese from the pepperoni and hamburger pizza, it had soaked through the box and stained my car seat on my trip home. Every Dominos has great service. This one just has poor quality ingredients.<//review>

The pizza was very good and arrived within ten minutes of the delivery time. However,  I suggest always ordering extra cheese. I'm glad I did because otherwise there would have been no cheese at all.< /text>

Staff is friendly. The pizza is pretty good, place is clean but they do mess up 1 of 3 orders. I just dont like waiting and going back to get another one. I must admit Domino's makes it super easy to order with ok Google or the app.< /text>

Fast, friendly and delicious. We ordered a large Extravaganzza and a large Philly Cheesesteak. Delivery was estimated as 35-45 minutes but arrived in 30. Pizza was piping hot and exactly as ordered. Toppings were generous and pizza was perfectly cooked.</Text>

<Review>I am usually not one to place a rating on a company but this is the final straw after the third time, 1st delivery no cheese or peppers and that follows also for the second and third delivery all different times, the pizza barely had cheese on it and the delivery guy is so unprofessional, this last time this guy showed up again demanding a dollar for peppers and cheese , now let me remind you I have tipped this guy 4 dollars 2 separate times and I never mentioned it, well this last time I had paid extra for ranch and no extra ranch was delivered and also no peppers or cheese and when I told the guy I paid extra for ranch , he tells me "well there is one in there" but I ordered in extra one meaning there should be 2. I am so over it , I will never order from here again.<//Review>< userid>

I don't know if they include your tip history in your file with your number or whatever but it seems like the last few times I ordered I've gotten significantly less bacon on my pizza which is always one of two toppings. I understand tipping is normal to most society but I believe you should pay your employees a fair wage rather than waste ink on pizza boxes pan handling for money you're too greedy to split evenly. I guess tipping $1 is no good to these drivers in this economy. Also its insane they only offer deals exclusive to online only, it will only result in pissed off customers in the end if you don't honor it all around</review>

We ordered in yesterday and gave us a completely wrong order but it was in our name. But when we called they "couldn't understand what we were trying to say". Well they said they would send for a new pasta but they laughed and never gave us a new one. Total waste of money!😡😡😡 This location is horrible!!!!!</review>

Pizza was good service was excellent. The only thing I had a problem with was the guy waking dough was tossing pizza and answered the phone and resumed tossing pizza without washing his hands. ... otherwise this location is open late for pickup and delivery.< /Text>

<review>I have been watching the new online timer, and if it takes 10 minutes to quality check my pizza its going to be cold and not worth eating. Pizza just got here... no ranch. I paid an extra  2 dollars for ranch and now my delivery driver went back to the store to get my ranch  by the time i eat my food will be cold and grose. Wish i didnt tip...<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Usually order Delivery and service is great!

**Updated**
This is the first time I have ever done pick up to this dominos. Man im impressed! Freshly painted. Smelled like a fresh clean kitchen, everything was perfect! On top of that, the GM took the time out to have a couple min conversation to ask about my day. All the employees in this store seem to stay busy and are very presentable.

<Text>Horrid pizza and customer service. Discrimination towards family members and profiling customers. They got the address wrong on a delivered pizza. My brother called about it- they said they delivered it to the wrong place, so come in and the pizza is yours free due to the inconvenience. Upon arrival, they neglected to give the order pizza for free, due to ignorance of CSD. Reporting this location to Domino's corporation.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Worst pizza ever. Old mushrooms, very little to near nonexistent toppings. Regular crust was under done while thin crust pizza was nearly burnt yet limp from sitting around for over a half hour (per their pizza status meter). Delivered 40 from time the meter said it was done.< /Review>

Been training here for the past 6 months, I honestly can say I am in the best shape of my life thanks to my trainer/ coach Luis , I have lost 42 lbs and can lift more weight than ever before. My mile time went from 9 minutes to just below 7 min mile. It is a great open space with tons of free weights. I highly recommend you give them a try. Awesome community of people everyone is welcoming and supportive. It really is the best part of my day. They also have a nice outdoor workout area too.< /text>

My favorite place to be. Has sleds, tires, battle ropes, farmer walk bars, Olympic setups, a staircase, heavy bags, and all the regular gym equipment. Also less crowded. Staff are excellent and kind. So are the members.<//review>

< Review>
As I looked into my recent photos, I can see that I am getting fatter. So, I decided to go to this gym near our house. And I acquired a great service because they really assisted me in what to do for me to lose weight. In just a week I lose 2kls and it made me feel eager to lose more!</Review>

<text>Since discovering the perfect dress at this boutique, this is my first and last shopping trip. She'll take a look at you and try to figure out what you're wearing. The salespeople were pleasant, attentive, and made me feel special. As a result, I'll tell everyone I know!</text>< pics>

<Text>Parked by this place the other day while picking up from the neighboring restaurant and there was a crowd of about 20 people running laps in the street without masks on? This is also during a peak surge of COVID-19 in Los Angeles hospitals. Seems to be a complete disregard for the safety or respect of the surrounding area where there are numerous businesses and dog parks that remain open.</Text><rate>1<//rate><Time>1610481888534< /Time>< Gmap_id>

It has many and also flexible open gym hours, which was all we needed for our training program. The coaches were very gentle, receptive and helpfull. The owner is an awesome guy that made us feel like home and it was really a pleasure meeting him!

Been training here for about 6 months . Excellent environment for training . Never made so many friends at a gym. Solid coaching and programming never been so strong just wanted to give them a shout out for all the support they have given me. If your into it Olympic weightlifting or CrossFit  this the best spot in downtown.</Text>

Very very rude staff. Extremely poor communication. I dropped in to see what the environment is like. They said I could just work out. Then FORCED me to pay $20 by shouting at me in front of everyone in the gym, when I simply said I didn’t know the price list.<//review>

<Review>Trojan Athletics is the premier one-stop shop for your fitnessing needs in DTLA. Nestled in the heart of LA’s electric,  thriving and growing arts district, Trojan Athletics provides a fantastic environment for working out and making new friends.

Trojan’s offerings include CrossFit classes (satisfying for both veteran CrossFitters and those new to CrossFit), a dedicated olympic weightlifting program, gymnastics, personal training and more. Each of these offerings are managed by Trojan’s top notch staff.  All of the coaches genuinely want to see members continue to meet their fitness goals and are dedicated to making those goals happen.

Plus, Trojan’s space is huge. Because of the size of the gym, you’ll never have to worry about being jammed together with other members as you work out — there’s plenty of breathing room.

Overall, I can’t recommend Trojan Athletics enough. It’s been my home gym for 7 months and I have no plans to switch gyms anytime soon.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I cannot speak highly enough of Trojan Athletics. I have been working out here for almost a year and can attest to its strengths: knowledgeable coaches, clean facility, and great community.

Coaching — The coaches at Trojan are incredibly attentive and extremely knowledgeable about CrossFit and weightlifting. I came to Trojan as a complete beginner; I had never used a barbell or done any kind of Metcon training. What I noticed immediately is that ALL the coaches took the time to train me properly and ensure that I was completing movements correctly. Crossfit sometimes gets a bad name due to athlete injuries, but the coaches at Trojan truly invest in helping beginner athletes form correct habits and advanced athletes modify their technique.

Classes — Classes are offered throughout the day and up until 8 pm, which was a huge bonus for people (like myself) who work late. The classes are TOUGH and will push an athlete both mentally and physically to achieve his or her fitness goals. After a short time training here, I began to notice changes in my strength, body composition, and muscle mass.

Community — The people who train at Trojan are a close knit community. The athletes here are a diverse group of ALL skill levels and are extremely welcoming. During the CrossFit open, the sense of camaraderie was exceptional. We all stayed to watch our friends in hourly heats. Memorial Day and Regionals offer other opportunities to compete and have fun.

I highly recommend Trojan Athletics to athletes of any skill level or desired fitness goals.< /text>< pictures>

The programming they provide is killer. They give you tips and tricks while perform the workout or after. They don't have a lazy staff. The space is big and the equipment is well maintained. They know what they are doing. You will not be disappointed joining the community or dropping in.

Whether you are just starting Crossfit or have been doing it for several years, you will find Trojan such a fun environment with an awesome community of people that will push you to get better and stronger. The gym is a huge space that is extremely clean and well laid out, with room for large and fun classes. Darren, Dave, Anna and Rich are extremely knowledgeable and will encourage and push you to become a better athlete. They always make classes fun and ensure you are practicing proper form. Such a wonderful gym that I am so sad to be leaving as my time in LA has come to a close.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<review>This box is pretty great. They go through the movements and have plenty of modifications to make sure you don't get hurt or frustrated about the movements in the workout. They are more of a traditional box, but not in the sense that they require you to vomit and go into rhabdo to be a part of the box.

All that can be said probably for a lot of boxes (thankfully), but what sets Trojan apart is Darren. I was a visiting student for a month and pretty strapped on cash. Darren was very understanding and incredibly flexible with making sure I met my fitness goals while going through this incredibly expensive time in my education.

Thank you Darren and Trojan Athletics! Please check them out on your way through LA.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I love training at Trojan Athletics! Not only the classes are very well planned out, but also the sense of community that you feel while working out with like-minded people, is priceless. In a short amount of time at Trojan, I've been able learn more about Crossfit and its lingo, get stronger, and build some great friendships as an added bonus. If you're in the Downtown LA area and Art District vicinities, this is the box for you! PS: They have the best protein smoothies at the Tonic Bar, conveniently located on site!<//Review>

< Review>
Nice people workout here. Weightlifting and crossfit equipments are plenty and facility conditions are ok. But read your contracts carefully and treat every transaction like a serious business dealing regardless of how much time you spent here. Being meek, agreeable, or expecting personalized services can (repeatedly) incur financial consequences.

Edit after reply: I do not mean to object to any contracts I signed up. Other gyms employ such policies. However, as an old member staying for years through a few ups and downs of this place, I do feel entitled to a bit more friendly reminders on changes of terms when they applies to me (i.e. I do not recall any mention of the cancellation policies except buried inside the contract, which of course I should've read, when I asked to change my plans). Similar misunderstandings had happened before, and those times I backed down (as is this time except this feedback) because the specific situations were reasonable from the gym's perspective. However, such occurrences without much leeway do not make me feel like a valued member of the community.

(besides, shouldn't the proper *business* response to a request of cancellation at a date specifically showing my ignorance of the policy be "That cannot be done because your contract would not allow it. Earliest possible date is ..." instead of "Confirmed!" ?)<//Review>

<Text>I found my new home two years ago at Trojan Athletics. As an Olympic Weightlifter, they offered me the coaching and atmosphere I was looking for. The coaches are extremely knowledgeable and attentive. They go above and beyond for their athletes.

Not just is the coaching terrific, but the people who make up the community are wonderful. I’ve made so many friends through the gym over the years, and the owner and coaches definitely do their part to make sure members have the opportunity to get to know each other through events, cookouts, and trips to the beer garden across the street.

If you’re looking for a great place to train with even better people, Trojan Athletics is your place.< /Text>< time>

I come here every day and can honestly say this is the best Crossfit gym ever. The programs are challenging and cater to every fitness level and intensity. The facility is excellent: clean, well-maintained, with a variety of equipment. The community here is fantastic, and the coaches are attentive and knowledgeable.

Just wanted show some support and appreciation for everyone that has coached me and pushed me to get fit lost over 30lbs of fat and gained 20lbs of muscle. Went from a 38”inch waist to a 31”  can’t say enough of how happy I am.</text>

I recommend this Crossfit gym to anyone & everyone in the downtown LA area!! The community is great, friendly and welcoming, and the instructors are extremely knowledgeable and helpful; and open to all levels in essentially every class. To name a few, Tiffany, Kayla, Devin and Rich are THE BOMB coaches and Darren is great too!! I love the energy of the gym, the size of the place, but mostly the people and challenging WODs every day!

<text>Just go to another place. Crossfit spots are a dime a dozen and this place is run by scumbags.

In fairness, this is a nice facility and good people go there but they engage in horrible and corrupt business practices. Be warned and do not pre-pay for anything. Darren Shephard is a lowlife crook. As background:

- I was injured and unable to continue doing any type of physical activity. I had to have surgery. They saw my problem and were well aware of the issues.

-  I asked to have the private classes transferred to my wife so she could try it out. They said no.

- I asked for a refund since I could never use the classes again and they refused to have them transferred. They said no.

- I asked to see a copy of the contract covering the purchase of classes and they said no. Seriously? Who does that? Guess who? Criminals.

- All of this is in writing.

Its shocking to see such behavior. It is illegal. Do yourself and your friends a favor and just go somewhere else or pay money on the barrel for every class. Seriously, Darren Shepard is a lowlife crook who feels its ok to steal.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c63b8f37d93f:0x52e86b6b89f599b5</gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Trojan Crossfit is an amazing awesome box. The coaches are PHENOMENAL and all the members are so sweet, friendly and energetic. It's a wonderful place to join whether you are just starting out, changing boxes, or just want to get an awesome workout in. The coaches are attentive, full of knowledge and advice, you are not pressured into doing anything you don't feel comfortable doing, there is always an alternative to any WOD, modified or RX you are always cheered on and left feeling amazing!  Trojan is definitely the best box I have ever been to, and probably will always be the best. I love the people, the box and the whole entire atmosphere!! Goooooo Trojans lol!!<//Review>

<Text>We love Venita Rhea’s! The portions are large and we often share an entree. A little disappointed in the Louisiana Omelet, there was very little hot link and it was all at one end of the omelet.

Customer service was excellent. Waitress was on top of it. The food was flavorful, hot and not overly priced. They had pumpkin pancakes that melt in your mouth. Only thing I was not crazy about was the Mimosa. The orange juice used seemed like an artificially flavored juice which I don't personally care for. I recommend this place and intend to go back regularly.<//Text>

OMG the food is delicious! The prices might seem high when perusing the menu but when the food comes out you forget the prices. The plates look amazing and they are full of flavor. Half portions are only a dollar less so you might as well bring home some excellent leftovers. Bring your appetite you're going to need it.

The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and on top of their game.<//review>

The food is great, but the wait is long when they cross your name off, and give your table to someone else.  15 minute wait turned into 45.<//text>

I'm not complaining about the food itself it was good. But it was as good as any other breakfast place nothing special.. what was extra was their prices holy cow..A FIFTEEN DOLLAR PANCAKE!!! it was a big pancake but still for fifteen bucksyou would think the fruit or toppings would come with it but no that's 3 dollars more... EIGHTEEN FREAKING DOLLARS... NO WAY NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING WORTH IT.  Do yourself a favor go to any other breakfast place on the planet have the exact same breakfast with no wait and save yourself a ton of money.<//text>

If I could give less I would!!! My boyfriend and I love trying new breakfast spots in different towns and cities, this was by far the worst we have had to date.  It took 45 minutes just to get food ordered and they were not that busy and had plenty of staff. When we did order is wasn’t even our waitress and she said, “I see your waitress keeps passing you up.” 25 more minutes we receive our food and it was awful!  The chicken fried steak was soggy and the gravy was bland, the orange juice was sour from the rind being juiced with it.  The bacon was not as advertised “thick cut” it was thin with bad marbling.  The eggs for scrambled were egg beaters not fresh eggs and the potatoes were so bland you needed 2 teaspoons of salt to make edible.  DONT DRINK THE WATER IT IS ROCKLIN TAP AND HORRIBLE.<//review>

When I inquired why I was told we were next. Ok so server was friendly but not in a hurry to take our order, to check on our meal or to get our check. After I had placed my leftovers in a container, I found a nasty hair in my food. DISGUSTING!!! I asked for that meal to be removed from my bill and they flat refused. We will never go back.

Very friendly servers. Solid, brunch menu. Huge portions. Bottomless mimosas... twice now, it has gotten busy while we were having brunch and our server dropped a bottle of champagne and carafe of juice at our table so we wouldn’t have to wait:)<//Review>

This was our first time here. Worse experience we ever had. We were skipped twice by the host. Then the service was slow. The last straw was a piece of hair on the plate. We told them and they refuse to take the meal off the bill. I should have taken a picture and posted.< /review>

This place was very good. My husband had a chimichangas and I had one of their scrambles. I wish the food had been a little fresher, but still good. The service was excellent. Lots of options to choose from.<//review>

Sorry but Venita Rhea's has been going downhill for quite some time. Our last visit the owner was napping under a table with a napkin on his face. Very disturbing and unprofessional. Really struck me as odd. The staff has always been very friendly, kind and knowledgeable. Sad to come in to find out our favorite waitress doesn't work there anymore. The drop in food quality along with the loss of our favorite waitress and bizarre behavior of the owner has soured our love for this once favorite place. Won't be coming here anymore. Good luck.<//review>

<text>I met a group of business professionals at Venita Rhea's for breakfast. We were seated promptly at a round table where my group could see each other to discuss matters at hand. The staff was friendly and courteous when taking our orders, and our food was excellent. I really enjoyed the comfortable atmosphere, and I look forward to returning often.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Reaaaaaaally good biscuits and gravy.  Awesome chicken fried steak and the orange juice, hooolllly cow.  A lot of people say "fresh squeezed" but this was legitimately fresh squeezed.  Best orange juice. 10/10 favorite breakfast place in Northern California.</text>

<review>fantastic, looking forward to next time. service was fast, friendly and the food scrumptious. I had the Eggs Benedict with Egg Plant and the Hubs Steak and eggs. The eggplant was moist and sweet, the eggs just right topped with Bearnaise. The steak was flavorful, no additional seasonings required. The fresh squeezed carrot juice was a perfect complement.</review>< Pictures>

Good food; nice variety. Cute decor.  Very busy. Long waits. Orders mixed up creating a longer wait. Very noisy and cramped. I suggest trying it at least once to see if it's your thing. Some people rave about it. Others find it so-so.  My family is divided between 2 and 4 stars, so I gave the average of 3.< /Review>

Lunch is busy, which is a good sign! Menu is good old middle of America food. They do breakfast and lunch. Close at 3pm. I had the Liver and Onions. Good choice!! Best Liver I have ever had bar none!! Lots of it, good quality and cooked just right. Lots of fried onions. Often restaurant's go light on the onions but here they give you lots. Yummm. And 3 big thick rashers of bacon. Also a large helping of mashed potatoes well done. Bowl of tasty gravy on the side. All in all everything just right. 5 Stars for the Liver and Onions!!< /review>

<Text>Very tasty breakfasts in a fun and friendly environment. I've always been impressed with the quality of the food when we have gone here. Also a fun restaurant for the kids. They have a fun wall painting that has all kinds of hidden movie characters, and it is always fun trying to find them all! Highly recommended.<//Text><resp>None</resp>< rating>

<review>Outstanding food.  Great service.  Had the eggs Benedict.  The Canadian bacon was thick, tender and tasty.  I prefer the English muffin toasted, but will simply request it next time, because I will be back.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

When they are that crowded, we try to get the same menu items or simple items. When it's busy,  everyone is running including Ralph the owner. We love this place. They have a new menu items bi-weekly, I think.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809b1ee10b46c585:0x785dc43fd7e77039< /gmapID></record>

Venita Rhea' s is a great family owned local restaurant.  They serve breakfast and lunch.  They are very popular so you may have to wait during peak hours.  Make sure you come hungry!  Everything is delicious and the portions are huge!  The wait staff are all very friendly and experienced.  Many of them have been working there for years.< /Text>

I have been coming here for quite a few years and i don't think I've ever had something that wasn't delicious. The service over the years has been hit & miss but this time our waitress was attentive and our order came out surprisingly quick. Of course we left fat & bloated LOL! If you like eggs benedict, they have one of the largest selections of different types to choose from. If you are seated on the left side near the large mural, while you are waiting for your food, check out all the "little surprises" and secret little items or characters randomly scattered into the landscape. Someone had some fun with that and we seem to find something each time that we hadn't seen before. They are super busy during your typical brunch hours so we prefer to go a little closer to lunchtime if its a weekend. Weekdays don't seem to be as bad.</Text>

Was extremely disappointed in our brunch this past week. Food arrived cold, had yellow asparagus-should not have been used. Our meals were half orders and they filled half the plate w like warm country potato’s. This place was much better when Randy owned it in my opinion. Had to wait 10mins to pay our bill. I won’t be taking out of town guests there anymore. It used to be a favorite place😢< /review>

I used to visit here years ago so I was glad to find it was still open. The portions are decent but I feel the quality of the food isn't the same. May be romanticizing it but for the price you pay, corned beef with "canned" quality doesn't seem good.

Still has the best mural though.</text>

Excellent experience over all but why I'm really writing this review is because of the Eggs Benedict. The poached egg could not have been done any better. I mean there is nothing worse than getting Eggs Benedict and having a badly done egg. They know what they're doing here. It was perfection. And they have lots of options at that. Excellent place.</text>

Service is good, staff is friendly but not helpful (Shannon is the exception as she is both friendly and helpful).  I just paid 18.50$ for 2 chocolate chip pancakes, bacon and a small glass of orange juice.  I keep saying I’m never going back because of declining food quality and taste but for some reason I do because it’s close to my house.  Save yourself some time and money and go somewhere else.<//text>< Pics>

Tons of delicious breakfast and lunch options - both classic and unique - and everything was prepared very well. They also have an unusually large selection of hot sauces, which always makes me happy. The service is friendly and attentive. Parking is easy.<//review>

If you've been here you already know the service is spot on here. The kind you cant get in often in busy places. The food is great and honestly I cant say enough good things about the establishment. Would definitely recommend!</text>

This place is so wonderful and busy I'm not sure I want to let anyone else know about it!😀  Food is amazing and abundant; staff is supurb; and owner is caring and attentive.  The fact that some of the staff have been there over 18 years is a testament to the quality of the management and the excellence of the food served there.  Love it!<//Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>This place has a great menu and the food is wonderful.  My only complaint, and it was entirely my fault, was slow service.  I came alone and they offered me a table or a seat at the"bar".  I chose the latter.  Iwas the only customer there and it took a while to get service.  There were lots of servers there, it's where they input the orders and, it turns out, where the staff take there meal breaks. I suspect everyone just assumed i was someone else's guest.  Still, I got everything I wanted and it was delicious.  I'll just choose a tablenext time.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I don't know if they were purchased by a  new owner or not but I think it has a new owner.  Food wasn't up to the quality it was. Mind you it wasn't bad it just wasn't the same. Large portion but so so quality.< /Review>< Pics>

Our server was gracious, but nothing was special or seemed to justify what we felt were high prices.  Chairs were old and flat as boards with the cushions worn out.  Loved the idea of the free coffee while we waited but it was not very good and left us not wanting to buy more as we ate.  Never let our waters go down much so loved that.  Pancakes were very large and fully cooked but otherwise nothing special.  My California Scramble turned into heartburn alley.  Burgers were well presented and looked good but tasted nothing special and do not compare to the similarly priced Red Robin premium burgers.  Nothing was bad or unnaceptable, and some of the small touches they do are great but we left spending a ton and no desire to return.< /text>

<Text>Very good breakfast, satisfying portions. The food is perhaps a little pricey for breakfast, but if you live in the area, check your mail for the coupon mailers -- they usually have a buy one entree get one half off, or something similar. That makes it great food for good value.</Text>< Pictures>

My cousin and her husband wanted to take us to Venita Rhea's to celebrate my husbands birthday, what a nice time we had. I had read the review about this restaurant and wanted to check it out. There is nothing left to be said that I didn't read about. We live up in the mountains where the portions are quite large so I expected this after reading the reviews and they were very generous. The staff very friendly, the restaurant very clean, the food was FANTASTIC and the decorating made you feel real 'homey'. Would we return, without a doubt and we will hope that this review encourages you to go too. Thank you VENITA RHEA'S for a most wonderful time with my cousin and her husband.</Review>

I have always loved Venita Rhea's, and have visited it often throughout the years. This Sunday my sister and I went and had the very best breakfast and service experience ever! Thank you to Patty for making it so special for us. What a treat - the benedicts were to die for, the mimosas, and best of all was the loving service. Thank you Ralph and staff for having such a marvelous place for us to enjoy!</Review>

<Name>Caleb Champion< /Name><pics>None<//pics><Text>A Rocklin classic for over 20 years. Even with the new owners this place still serves up reliably good breakfast and brunch that pleases any out of towners. They specialize in a multitude of eggs beneficts that are all amazing! Coffee still good, bacon still a little pricey, but still worth every penny and you will never leave unsatisfied.<//Text>< gmapID>

Service was great but the Burger was not done well enough so they cut the price in half to make up the deference we will return again.<//text>

One of the best breakfast places in the area, in my opinion. The only other clothes contender is Awful Annie's in Auburn.<//Text>

I ordered the crab eggs benedict and it had to go back, not even at my request but the waitress notice that the eggs were overcooked so she took it back. When I got my plate the food it was cold, the crab cakes we're not good, the bread was not your normal sourdough English muffins but some other bread that did not go well. The Hollandaise sauce was not flavorful either. I did not enjoy the few bites I took nor will I recommend this place to anyone.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Utterly Metiocre. You go to a restaurant to pay for food and service. We didn't receive either. The food was cold and soggy over salted.  The portions were huge. However of the food is cold tasteless or over salted it is a large amount of garbage. We let them know in person ams on thwre website or disappointment. If you want quality go to high hand conservatory in Loomis. Same cost better everything.< /review>
