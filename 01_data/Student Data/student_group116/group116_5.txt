.
Saturday morning, sun is out and plans are temporarily on hold due to unexpected flat tire.  I put enough air to drive down the street before risking being  stranded on the side of the road.  Why this detail? Because I easily drive by 4 other tire shops but knew I had to go to Just Tires.

From the  minute I walked in I felt the good vibe of this location. Hector made the process very easy, explaining to me how the air valve might have been damaged.  I was told the wait would be over an hour long because of the number of customers. I seriously didn’t mind the wait though because of the friendly, almost family like atmosphere that you feel once you walk in.  I spoke to the other workers there, joking and having a great conversation. You can  genuinely tell the team here loves their jobs.  They had a great movie on( not a boring tv channel like most places) and being completely honest I was excited to watch it.  (Remember I had an hour) Hector suddenly comes in right as the movie was getting good and told me my car was done.    I didn’t even spend 15minutes in there.   The team valued my time and worked on the valve as soon as they could so that I could enjoy my day off.
.
This team from straight to finish was amazing. I can’t talk enough about how honest they are and the little details that they take that are greatly appreciated.

Thank you!  Monica</Text>< Time>

Manager Hector C. was very courteous and knowledgeable. Technician James G. was able to bring alignment to factory spec and after doing short test drive brought my attention to possible minor issue in car’s suspension. And by the way waiting office is very clean with plenty of cold drinking water .< /text>< Pictures>

Lady at the reception was super helpful and explained all the options for a tire change in details which made a huge difference cause I don’t know a thing about cars. Plus they have a warranty program so if anything happens they’ll fix or replace that tire for free!

I want too give a great shout out to Diana, at just tires for doing the utmost to get me some new tires. She’s very profesional and charismatic. She’s a great critical thinker, and a very hard worker. Diana is a great representation of the company, and because of her I will be bringing my money here all the time. I will also be recommending my fellow peers. Great service, great employee, I couldn’t ask for anything better.</Text>

<text>Stopped in on my way to somewhere else because my car alert of all 4 tires were under pressure came on. I panicked as I was on the freeway. I got off and googled the nearest just tires and went directly there. Hector was so kind and helpful right away. I told him my plight and he said several cars had been in for the same thing. He explained that it was cold last night and this does happen. He checked my pressure and then filled all tires to the proper inflation. He also gave me directions to where I was going.  All with a wonderful attitude and a smile even behind the mask, I knew he was smiling. This made my day. Thank you Hector.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

This place have been here for years now and now I don't go anywhere else. This is their only shop. They get pretty busy.

Really good tires prices beating Firestone and other shops. Get a free rotation after 50kmiles.<//Text>

Thank Hector for the great and honest service.
And to add on , he will also work on my car , that’s great to see a manager who gets down and dirty !!!< /Text>< rate>

I work in customer service and she is exactly what ANY company would need. This was my first time going through something like this so the fact that Hector called another store to get my paperwork for me and then when I got here they made me feel better and taken care of, I am so grateful I came here!

<Review>I received excellent customer service at this location. I went with a nail in my tire a few minutes before closing. The receptionist was extremely kind and professional. She did not look bothered by my late arrival, even though it meant they would have to stay late to assist me. She and the other technicians  worked fast and efficiently to patch my tire and send me on my way.They took the time to explain to me the type of patch they were placing on my tire and the protection level it would provide. They also offered advice and tips on what to do if I was again in this situation in a more hazardous scenario. I am very grateful to have stumbled upon this tire shop in such an inconvenient situation . I commend these employees for  their knowledge, efficiency, and integrity.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This place scammed a family member if mine a few years back. He went in for tires, after they were done the car wouldn't start. He was told that the battery was bad and needed a new one, he didn't want to deal with it so he paid for one. The "bad" battery was less than a year old.

This place will scam you.</Review>< userid>

Stopped in to have a the tires checked for air pressure and was happy with the service I received. Hector and his new employee Diana have great personalities and are very knowledgeable, patient, and helpful.  Forget the dealer,  I'm not going to them anymore to be ripped off. Next time maintenance is due, I'll try this place out.< /Review>

I’ve been a client of just tires for about 10-12 years .. I got a nail on one my tires and was told I needed a new tire.. I was able to contact Hector ( store manager) and told him what they had just told me. Drove to the shop and he looked at it .. came back and said “ You don’t need a new tire  it can be fix” .. thanks Hector for been honest I think most shops see a female and think we are naive or dumb and take advantage of us.. but not Hector.. thank you again</text>

Poor customer service
I called asking for some tires, Juan answered the phone and placed me on hold because he was with another customer.. Being with customers is great and we all have to get in line to get served, agreed however, the way in which he answered wasn't very polite or professional ..  " I'm with a customer wait til I get done"  waited six minutes and 47 seconds... he answered what do you need?" I said I'm looking  for a few  tires.. I gave him the information, and he said I have nothing i stock but I can order them for you. I said no thanks...

I called Pep Boys and I got a totally different attitude. Maybe Juan doesn't like his job or doesn't  care, either way , he answered rude . I'm definitely not going to give business to a company who has employees with that kind of an attitude.
By the way, I tried calling the regional manager Mike and I received exactly the same attitude ..  whats the point?
Its probably the way Just tires personnel run the place..

Do your own diligence.</Text>

The store manager, Felipe Del Real, handled things very professional and will give you a straight answer if you need any help.

To the owner of the shop, give him a raise! It's hard to find somebody like him that give excellent customer service. I left the shop with pleasant experience.

Good job, Felipe.< /Review>

I got a flat on the 118 and this was the first place I found open right after work and I am so glad I found it.  Not only were the staff very courteous and helpful but one of the guys there gave me a ride to the metrolink station rather than let me walk in the rain for about 3/4 mile.  I really appreciate the service and the care they took to make the best of the situation I was in.  You can expect me to go to that place again for all my tire needs and I'll make sure that I let everyone I know about this place.  Thanks guys!</Text>

Had an appointment on a Monday at 5pm and when I arrived the huy in the desked said that he was short staffed and would not be able to attend me. So I went back the next day and it took them 4hrs to get my service done. And with an attitude. They run on slow mode.</text>

<Review>Nightmare!!! Tires went bald in under a year! I work for a shop, have MISTAKENLY referred people and shops to them, I apologize. I'm taking steps to correct that. My tires went bald after 9 months roughly 5,000 miles! They tried to blame me for it! lol seriously? You've got to be kidding me.... I told customer services I wanted to speak with the regional manager if possible, his name is mike by the way. Beyond rude, started screaming at me over the phone. Wow, I seriously can't believe these people are still in business. If I had to guess they were friends and covering their buddies a@@. All of it is because they guy who sold me the tires didn't record mileage correctly....an employee error they want me to pay for.  I'm over it, going to American Tire Depot, they've rotated my tires for free, topped off my tires with nitrogen for free, American Tire Depot is where it's at and I'm going there for the replacements. I haven't even bought from them yet and their customer service has been amazing.  BUYER BEWARE! STAY AWAY! BALD TIRES IN UNDER 7K MILES! American Tire Depot is where I'm going next<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
It should be NO STARS for this place! I had a terrible experience when I went to replace the breaks on my car. First of all, the employees here are rude. Then, they seem to favor some customers over others. I waited for over 3 hours to have my breaks changed, while many who came after me left with in 10 to 30 minutes. I was patient, but observed the employees goofing around all along. When I asked the employees, they told me that mine takes a while because the wheels need to be resurfaced. When I finally talked to the manager, they finished mine in 5 minutes. Then, I saw one of the employees played delay tactics when he drove my car out of the shop. I guess this was a ravage for complaining to his boss. I felt violated when I left the place.

Update: I went back to this place today, after two months, because my breaks were still making noise. They found that they were bad. I wonder if they were replaced the first time. Anyways, they fix it, but it took them 3 hours! Really bad service!</Review>

Pretty much your standard gym. It is kept clean and you can do whatever you need to do for the most part. If you are looking for a fancy over the top gym look elsewhere. But for $35/mo, it's good. It can be rather crowded but not as crowded as some of their other gyms around, usually don't have to wait long to use their equipment.< /review>

Edit: I was back and you did not disappoint! Cold water shower again! Yeah! Much earlier this time, about 0730, so it's not just the gym-traffic, it is actually how you do business. I asked for it and you delivered! In all honesty, I bet you save a TON on your energy/water bill. Ha!

Not a bad place at all. There's iron enough to make things heavy. The Gravity was working just fine. Not badly crowded. There was a touch of chalk on the floor, so someone is at least TRYING to do some work in this place. I approve.

Dinged one star because there was NO hot water in the showers at around 1030. Ha! But that's only one star. And it might have been a fluke. I've dealt with worse. "Refreshing", that's the adjective. It was eye-openingly "refreshing". -- I'll give it another try sometime and see if that's consistent. Ya hear that? Next time I will WANT cold water in my shower! Make sure that is available!< /Text>

This 24 has pretty much everything you need for a good workout.  It's an 'Active' club (lowest tier) there are no extra perks like a pool, sauna, basketball court, etc.

As a strength athlete, all I need are barbells, dumbells,  a power rack, benches, and accessories.  They have all of this and the equipment is new.  Facilities are clean as well.

The Jacklin 24 also offers classes which I have never attended but appear very popular, filling up fast. All in all, it's a solid gym and probably one of the nicest Active locations I've been to.  I prefer it to some 'Sport' locations.</Review>

Active level club. Facility is clean and well maintained. Staff is friendly. This gym offers a good variety of equipment and classes. Dumbbell hide and seek is a slight problem at this location.<//Review>

Had the place almost to myself at 3am. Plenty of cardio and strength training gear. Nice looking room for the group classes. Small locker room. Tiny shower room. Nice washroom. Why do gym guests make such a mess in the toilet stalls? As others have said, no wet area; no stretching in the spa after a workout here.< /Review>

I like the location.  It's the easiest to get to from where I currently live, but don't come here as often as I would like because it's one of the smaller gyms.  I don't have an issue with a smaller gym, but I feel like you have to play chess to get on certain equipment during busy time periods.  Could also be cleaner.< /Text>

Could be cleaner and the showers actually decent rather than cramped but it's an Active level so not expecting much. Other than that the gym itself is fine, standard stuff, and the PTs are good here.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><review>I enjoy coming to this gym to get a quick workout. No one bothers you. Mostly everyone is repectful of each other. I am impressed at the overall cleanliness of this gym. You would expect it to smell like a gym being that it is a gym, but they do a good job of keeping it clean. Not the club's fault, however, the restrooms can be less then appealing to use. That has more to do with the patrons not having manners to not urinate on the toilets, then the club keeping them clean. You can tell the staff is instructed to greet every member by management because some will actually look you in the eyes and speak to you and others will not. I was brought up to look at soneone when you speak to them just out of common courtesy. Finally, I love that there is a coral area near the front door I can park my motorcycle.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808fc8cb11468537:0x668fc661a218f55c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Really bad costumer service , the girl threw my license and got angry because I said im coming back another day, I do not remember her name but she was Asian, she saw me in a bad way, I think if she has problems with people she should look for another job and learn education first! stupid girl!</text>

It's your standard 24. I take a star off cause it gets ridiculously packed during your typical peak hours. Can't really say that's not true for other 24's, but this one especially.</Text>

The manger Ryan Grappone is a smile face with self-righteous, arrogant, prejudiced character.  I took my friend to this location. He refused to let her coming in as a guest his excuse is she is not with her local ID.  I have to ask her to sit in the guest area waiting for me,. and later he came over to me arguing with me, my friend sneaking in the gym, but my friend were just sitting on the chair waiting for me. I can't believe as a manager, Ryan Grappone has such a disgracing attitude to the cooperate customers, and he even want to kick me out of gym, because I insist to escalate the case to the district management.  we had escalated the case to the corporate legal&discrimination dept. and ready to per the legal assistance for the further lawsuit.</review>

<review>I have been coming here for over a year and it has always been a great experience except during rushes lol. Guess thats why its 24hours so you can go when everybody and their mom isn't there lol. My one thing is they take a while to fix machines. A treadmill will remain broken for a good two weeks or so until its fixed and not all treadmills have functioning heart rate monitors. Sucks but there's always another one to move to unless you go at peak times... But still fun to go to and join my bf and I haven't had any problems what so ever and management and staff is friendly< /review>< UserId.>

Mediocre experience. Interestingly, you can't listen to what's being shown on the TV as the treadmill is not connected to the TV. :D< /text>

<rate>1</rate><text>As with some other 1 start reviews, my review is based on the customer service and my experience with the awful staff at Kellogg house.

If you want to work with staff that is warm and welcoming, you will not get it here. Jacqueline is an absolute nightmare to be around. Rude, condescending and clearly not concerned with ensuring the brides she is working with are happy and have their needs met. Unfortunately I was so wrapped up in how pretty the venue was I didn’t think to look at some of her reviews. A quick sweep across yelp and other various wedding sites will give you an idea. Even her responses to some reviews are snarky and unprofessional.

First and foremost the venue allows outside catering, but be warned if you do not use their catering there are many things you are then not allowed to do or have. When I went to visit the venue initially I was shown around by her then assistant Kristen who gave my planner and I so much misinformation. From things we could do, receive, along with alternate rain plans. We found out weeks before that this was all false. Was it remedied? Of course not

My wedding day there was rain in the forecast but it didn’t end up raining. However, the venue never laid our dance floor because when they came in the morning PRIOR to the arrival time of vendors (at 12) it drizzled. That is understandable but when it was noon there was no rain from then on. We should have had our dance floor laid at that time but it was not and again it was never remedied What is irritating is the fact that we were told we would not be refunded the $350 cost of what we were never given. Lawsuit waiting to happen.

On top of this the venue manager was there the day of sucking the joy out of the entire day, making things difficult for my photographer, and having a sour face the entire time. Thank goodness for my wedding planner and the venue’s assistant Sarah. Without them the day probably would have been ruined.

At the end of the day the venue is more concerned with the amount of money that they are going to squeeze out of you and not with making sure they solve issues they have caused or with making their couples happy. If you want to make sure you get your money’s worth AND work with someone who actually cares about making this day special avoid Jacqueline and the Kellogg house.

I will definitely be adding my review to every wedding site I can find so hopefully no one else has to deal with her atrocious personality.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>Recently came here for a weeding. Beautiful venue. There was a lot of updating that recently happened and it all looks great. The main house has a genuine rustic look and a warm feel when inside. The reception area has artificial grass that it would take a second look to notice, but noticed also seeing people in heels not getting stuck. There is also a nice wood laminate dance floor with a chandelier hanging above; however, it is rather tiny. The one thing that doesn’t sit well is that the reception area is separated by two sections: one part it on top and the other half is down stairs. Keep in mind that this venue is on a hill besides the 10 fwy and you get an amazing view of hills near by.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

My best friend had her wedding at this venue this weekend and this venue has the most disorganized and unprofessional service that I have ever experienced. Sarah was the wedding coordinator for the wedding day and she arrived 30min before the start of the ceremony and did not send the shuttles to pick up the guests from the parking lot below so people were waiting in the hot sun for a long time. Once people arrived there were no directions given to the guests to take there seats so people proceed to wait in the hot sun longer. Once people begin finding their seats it was reported by guests that the coordinator was yelling orders at people.  She also disrespected the mother of the groom and several members of the wedding party numerous times though the day while we were trying to keep things on schedule because things were so far behind. Every time we attempted to find the coordinator the other staff told us she was unavailable to speak to us so we had no idea what was happening the entire night. The staff was rude and would roll their eyes at us when we would ask questions about what was happening. Refreshment stations were not refilled for guests throughout the night and at the end of the night the leftover cake was thrown in a box and ruined. This venue is beautiful but NOT worth the money you will pay to have to basically run the wedding yourself.< /text>

The Kellogg House is a great historical gem located on the Cal Poly Pomona Campus. The house can be rented out for special events and toured when staff is on site.< /Review>

Been coming here for many many years and this is a true authentic Kosher pizza with excellent ingredients I also get thier Greek salad which is just as delicious, great place to bring family and kids. The stuff crust pizza is the best pizza I've ever tasted.< /review>

They need to learn the customer is (almost) always right. I ordered thru my mask fish & chips and a side of onion rings. He only confirmed thru his mask my onion rings but he heard five orders of onion rings  and didn't hold up five fingers to confirm he had it right. When the error was pointed out to him he acted as if it was my fault rather than a miscommunication due to the masks. And they didn't get the fish & chips order at all.<//Text>

I have loved Nagila pizza for many years and order for family and neighbors out in the S.F. Valley each time I go into West Los Angeles.  I don't order pizza (being vegan) but order 1/2 pints and pints of their Hummus, Baba ghanoush, (very little smoke taste which I love) and their Israeli Salad, and Spanish Eggplant (more like ratatouille) Along with a dozen Pita's cut in half and sometimes a couple of their garlic breadsticks gives us dinner for two nights plus snacks.  I have tried the  Baba ghanoush at three other restaurants and found them tasting too much like smoke.  Food is consistent, and if you order ahead and pay on line  they will bring your order to go right to your car.</Review>

I cannot say enough about this place!
I needed a quick bite with lots of carbs and they didn't let me down.

I love east coast style pizza. The thin crust, cheese and flavors were all present. The place itself even transported me to the east coast. Walking in the door felt like I had time warped and jumped from Beverly Hills to NYC. The smells were amazing! You could smell the pizza, falafels, salad dressings, bread, and garlic! Just amazing.

I ordered a slice of cheese and two slices of garlic pizza. There was no disappointment in the flavor, consistency of the crust, amount of cheese or the freshness of the just cut garlic. I would most definitely eat here again.< /Text>

The salads are always so fresh and the falafels are very tasty even though they get smaller and smaller each time we order the falafel combo plate. Pizzas are okay. Their busboy and server is so nice and helpful!</Review>

I love this place! They make very tasty kosher inspired pizza and other delicacies, very affordable and always fresh! I would recommend having it delivered because parking is a little bit of an issue in that area there's no guarantees and the parking enforcement is always out! The owners are great they care about their restaurant and the appearance and equality!<//Text>

<Date>1552796998889<//Date><review>Nice place they have a lot of table space indoors and outdoors. The pizza was good, but if you eat it when it is really hot, the cheese falls off, The nachos and fries are also really good. There was a bit of a long wait for the pizza but nothing crazy. Over all it's really good, I go there all the time.
Definitely recommend this place.</review></record></dataset><record>

Pizza is decent, prices are more expensive than other Kosher pizza places and they "accidentally" charged me extra for an item I never purchased.. money was refunded but kinda sketchy..

most of the guys behind the counter were friendly but the guy who took my order (owner I believe) seemed kinda sour and hostile...
Two stars are only for the friendly staff who fixed the cashiers "mistakes" and the nice pizza parlour ambiance..

Don't really get why people rave about this place it really isn't any better than decent but that's just my opinion.< /Review>

<Review>Pizza is good. Nothing special. Parking is a disaster. There’s a guy that cleans the tables and serves the food. He is the nicest guy there. They should put him at the front counter instead of the current guy that’s there. The Guy at the register is extremely rude. I’ve been there twice in 3 days.

Negative side:

Pt.1 Me: When you order a pizza by phone they are SUPER rude and dont listen to what your saying wait time is excessive and so is the price. Took 10 minutes to place a simple order.

Pt.2 Friend: The dude that answered took so long and sounded so lazy. They were so bad at placing a simple order!! We both got so triggered because he wasn't listening and when my friend asked to repeat the number and she was like "no that's wrong" and he said it again and my friend was like yeah and he was like "yEah ThAt's whAt I sAid" Like why would you be so rude to a customer I HATE THAT DUDE

Positive side:

Pizza is good though. :)</Text>

< Review>
They have very good pizza. I ordered mushroom pizza , and it looked like pizza that you could find in Europe or non kosher restaurant. It has a lot of mushroom and chess on the pizza with good bread that was like plastic when it gets cold.
The quality of their pizza are so good that you can reheat for many times and you can end up with a fresh and testy pizza.
Something very nice that I see over there is they have kind of drive through.
You only need to order whatever you want even one slice of pizza and you stop front of the pizzeria and you call them so they will bring whatever you order to your car, so you do not need to look for any parking spot. They are so considerate and awesome that I will start going there.< /Review>

<Text>Okay, i never have the patience to write reviews but this is just worth it. I don't know whats wrong with the reviews that say their pizza is awful; their pizzas are, hands down, the BEST. The bread is perfect, the sauce is just right, and their cheese tastes fresh and 'real'. You cannot find pizza as good as theirs anywhere else. I guarantee that.<//Text><user_name>Ronda Mezrahi< /user_name>< response>

< Review>
Came here the other day and I'm definitely not coming back. You can certainley find a better pizza place literally anywhere. Asked for a medium coke they literally gave a cup the size of a water cup and provided no refills. The pizza was ok, but was overpriced. If you ask me it's definitely not worth the price they charge. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.< /Review>

I've been coming here over 20 years and by far this is the best restaurant known for its kosher pizza, ziti, fettuccine and more more known for including their staff that I always like to talk to when I am here!!

It's a place where you enjoy yourself!!</Text>

they can be like the DMV sometimes (Saterday night is when I go) they sent me from window to window based on what I needed to order.

when I mentioned how long I was waitng they said they were not even open for that long which was a lie.

Pizza is great for Los Angeles so 5-stars for that. #StuffedCrust

Nachos with all the toppings is pretty good , they use chips (rather than small corn tortillas sliced and put through the deep fryer). They are not cheap on cheese with the nachos.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Not recommended at all. Garbage pizzeria. Make a mistake and won't cancel a charge. Lie and face service. Not recommended specifically that region for another 20 restaurants.

לא מומלץ בכלל. זבל של פיצריה. עשו טעות ולא הסכימו לבטל חיוב. שיקרו ושירות על הפנים. לא מומלץ במיוחד שיש באזור עוד איזה 20 מסעדות.<//Text>

The food is unseasoned and most of it is served on paper plates. This was not the dine in experience i was looking forward to. 👎🏽<//text>

<review>Found this spot on Google maps looking for tacos dorados de birria. They don't offer them as an order but have a plate of birria served with rice and beans. Not dorados but hand made tortillas de maize make up for that little detail. I had their menudo. Very tasty. I would say the food here is worth the stop. This Covid pandemic decreases the ability to dine in, but good food is always worth it.</review>< username>

Great service, food was delicious. Dining room a little crowded, but they have tables for big groups. They serve the food on real plates, not plastic or paper. Not the best area, or location in the shopping center...but the friendly staff helps you forget about that.< /text>

<Review>This has to be one of the most tastiest and delicious Mexican food I've had. Reasonable prices and good service. Their salsa bar is pretty well stocked with delicious salsas and condiments.<//Review><time>1592539580401<//time>< GmapID>

Rude manager complained about parking there but the parking is for the entire plaza when there is no parking elsewhere. One of the female workers there was also quite rude. Saw them being rude to a young man working at the plaza minding his own business there too. I don't know what their problem is. Some people just like being so rude when there is no need for that negativity. If they are not hurting you don't be disrespectful. Good thing there are other places that are more respectful of customers or just people in general.<//text>

Their food is decent. My family knows it as plan C. We usually try other places but when everyone is closed, we go here just for the craving. Food is okay but unfortunately not the best in the area. Prices are decent too.< /review>

< Review>
Food was ok. But this is not the point of the comment. I would give this place 0 if it was a choice. A young man who doesnt look very bright stole our credit card information. We dont remember the details but our guess is that he probably took a picture of the card when he took it to the back. We recently got a notice from the bank that someone had tried to take $300 dollars from our account. And we know that it is this place because it was that last place that we went to and payed with that car. Beware</Review>

This restaurant has a lot of different selections and I want to try them all.

Food is good, service is good. Nothing outstanding here but if you're craving tacos it's a good place to go. They do need to work on cleaning their bathrooms though.< /review>

AWESOME! DELICIOSO! AWESOME! DELICIOSO!
The enchiladas are the best! Wet burrito is da BOMB!
Tacos are awesome! I've been here so many times I've lost count.
I always look forward to eating here every time I visit the BAKE.
They give you so much food you won't be able to finish it all.

I've tried the Huaraches they were not good,they deep fry them for some strange reason. I tried the Milanesa it tasted like the oil they cooked it in was old and previously used to fry fish. It was burn on the outside and raw on the inside. The Chilaquiles were okay.<//text>

Received AMAZING help from Brian! Not once, but two different times! (Including when an older man working the shipping area was anything but helpful).

Brian helped resolve issues both times and I truly appreciated his level of professionalism and customer service skills! I really hope he is appreciated! It’s obvious he stands out in level of care over some of the other team members and he deserves to be recognized for the way he represents the company.

Thanks Brian!<//text>

Yup as many have stated before, The tall old man with white long hair acts like he is very put out to do his job. Absolutely terrible customer service, and barks at me to stand back on the purple spot but when I came forward, he didn't move back. Also, refused to print my document and told me to use the computers. Manager was nice, but stay away from that dude.</text>

Incredibly condescending and unhelpful staff. Basic questions about mailing were answered with a flurry of "I-don't-knows" and "Look it up". Multiple times questions would get ignored while they had personal conversations amongst themselves. Cannot recommend this location until the staff learn to do their job.< /text>

FedEx office is very unpleasant experience. The tall old man with white long hair acts like he is very put out to do his job and ship my package. Barks at me to stand back on the purple spot. He could have asked me nicely. Treating me like a criminal when all I want to do is ship my package. He should not be in customer service. Bad representation of Fed Ex. Made me feel uncomfortable, but I needed to ship my package so I dealt with it, and got out of there as fast as I could.< /review>

I normally have so much anxiety when dealing with a large print and ship order but Marcio was absolutely the biggest help I could have asked for! From conception of our print job to helping me pack up and ship the prints to my sales team throughout the state, he helped me every step of the way. He is kind. He is patient. He rocks! They all do honestly. I frequently go to this FedEx for business and personal work and every time I always get help or assistance when I need it.

(Also, people you gotta give these guys a break. They deal with a lot of craziness right now with Covid and are just trying to do their best.. like all of us are.)<//review>

LOVE THIS FED EX!!! Thank you Amanda for saving the day!!

My coworker was verbally abused at another print shop and we called ahead to this Fed Ex location to see if they could help us out with our project. Amanda who works there answered the phone and was extremely helpful!!! When my coworker got to the shop, Amanda helped facilitate the printing and was so efficient!!! Thank you!<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I've been going to this location for years to mail packages or on occasion use the printers. I've only ever had positive experiences here. The staff are helpful and explain the price breaks when you're shipping a package. There's rarely a long line which beats the post office if you're in a hurry. There's usually plenty of parking. The only thing I've been unhappy with are the prices for overnight letters, you're good if it's just a few pages but anything with weight gets pricey (that would be at UPS, the US Post office or any Fedex) so try to go 2 day or ground if you can.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I go in and out with no problems because all I do is use the printer which is easy to navigate BUT if there’s an issue with printing or you’re unsure of how to use something the workers here are useless. Either they’re rude or they completely ignore you.</text>

I wanted to get in and out and that big guy name Brian had a holier than thou attitude. Some heavy set man with greyish beard. He had a line of people but instead of assisting me he pawn me off to a young girl and he walked away from the line. He pawned me off because I asked him to help me print something he refused to do so and instead with a line of people behind me rudely asked me to go the the girl besides him and he walked away. He said she would help me and rudely walked away. I’m thinking he’s a supervisor, if that’s the case he shouldn’t pawn of customers because it’s beneath him to help and b he shouldn’t belittle his employees. I will follow up with corporate on his behavior. Been in here a couple of times and the men seem to always be rude. The women however are very pleasant and understanding.<//Review>

Easy parking.  We were greeted as soon as we entered the store.  The item we were looking for was kind of tucked away, and it was easy to ask and be directed to it quickly.  There was no wait, and the cashier was efficient, professional, and friendly.  We visited around 11:45am on a Friday.< /review>

I went there yesterday to return some electronic items to a seller. I had packed them in two branded boxes from the seller - but I needed larger boxes into which to put the seller's branded boxes. The customer service person was extremely polite and efficient - although she was on the phone at the same time - trying to help another customer. It sounded as if she had been hung up on a few times by the party she was trying to reach. She was courteous and pleasant - and took the time to find the proper and least expensive boxes for me - and packed my items efficiently. I cannot understand the negative reviews. Her name was Joanna - and I told her I was going to write a review to commend her for her helpfulness even while she was multitasking.< /Text>

It can be an "extension" of your home office if you need to print something big or something fancy that you cannot do at home. You can send fax, email, etc.  You may do it by yourself or so can have FedEx staff do it for you. There are desktops that you can use which you pay per minute and there are office supplies you can buy.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Resp>None< /Resp><time>1508177233863< /time><review>If I could give less than 1 star, I would. I work for a multimillion dollar media company in the area, and I went to FedEx for a last-minute project that needed to be overnight-ed to one of our big clients. In the past, we have gone to FedEx for a similar project, but this time my colleague was stopped at one of the printers by the owner. He was immediately rude and condescending to my colleague. He very loudly told her that we could absolutely not use the printer to print labels and made a huge point of saying that he was the OWNER and that these were HIS PRINTERS. While he was going on his tirade, my colleague continued to politely say, "Okay, can you please help me find a solution? Okay, how can you help me then?" Instead of helping us, he continued making a big stink in the store, speaking to my colleague in a discourteous and patronizing tone. He even had the audacity to say that there were no labels on the sheet my colleague was holding. They were clear labels and had he taken a moment to stop being rude, he would have figured that out. I was so disgusted by his tone and demeanor that I nearly walked out, but this project was very time sensitive and needed the use of a professional-grade printer. Needless to say, we will NEVER use his services again.

Save yourself the trouble, as there are multiple places to get materials printed in the area. And with the negative reputation this place already has, they probably won't be around that long anyway. If you'll notice I'm not the first person to have this same complaint about the owner.

The only saving grace of this place is that the owner finally had another employee help us. Bryan has excellent customer service skills and his boss could really learn from him about how to speak to customers.</review>< username>

<Review>WARNING !!!!!!
a $15 hold is placed on your debit card when making copies !
It will reimburse in 1 - 2 days but a little heads up would have been nice.
Employee claims read the fine print on the kiosk and it is listed.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I moved cross country and shipped several packages from here. On one trip I was charged for seven packages when I only shipped six. The woman ringing me up didn't realize it until I was charged and she was left with an extra label. She didn't want to have to restart the sale so she told me the charge would just go back on my card after a few days. It didn't. I waited a few weeks and called FedEx. I was informed I would have to fill out a refund request form. I did that. I included all the information, as well as copies of the receipt and shipping label. It's now been four weeks since I sent that in and NOTHING. I called FedEx again and they have no record of a refund request. Since when can a business just charge you for anything they want and get away with it?
It's been over two months since I was overcharged because of her mistake and I still don't have my money.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Very slow and i have never been in a place of business where there is a culture of rudeness. Ive literally been in there by myself in line and had 2 employees look at me and kept doing whatever they were doing. Finally after 5 minutes someone said ill be with you in a second. Smh.. The people there also talk to you like you are stupid.. Fedex needs to do something.something.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I had a horrible experience with fed ex, they were so rude to me only the Julio and James were nice to me but there was some tall white guy with longish hair who was so rude they gave my package to wrong person I guess they don't always ask for id up in the register I got it delivered to them cause I thought it'll be safer than my house but it was the worst mistake ever. When I went the guy with longish hair was so rude and seemed so careless about what had happened to my package :(< /Review>

I dropped off a box with an HP computer inside for my business.  The KINKOS location accepted the package and a week later I find out that the package is still at the KINKOS location.  My package was damaged there and they wouldn't ship it out because the box had been damaged.  No one contacted me to notify me of the problem.  I had problems at my company because of this and KINKOS blamed me for packing the item wrong.  They refused to repackage it there and send it out and just bill the company.  I had to go back there and pick up the damaged package.  This location is very irresponsible.< /text>

The staff was keeping to themselves, when I went up to the front desk I was in plain sight of 3 of the 5 workers and they ignored me. Not gonna go back there.<//Text>

<review>I gave this place a chance and is just disappointment after disappointment.
Fist I got a lash curl that wasn’t curled at all, the owner offered to doing again, but if i didn’t end-up
Satisfied the fist time the second will be the same.
Then I got my nails done and were thick and chunky , uneven on the sides. I asked to get them filed down and I need to pay extra 20 dlls. This is a joke< /review>< Pics>

<text>Pretty but I was heavily overcharged- 3x the amount of a regular salon. Only came in because it was close by-wouldn’t ever go back. Especially since my nails didn’t come out perfect, though they are pretty just not symmetrical.< /text>< pics>

It's customers like you that keep us motivated to do our best.  Please spread the word to your family and friends.  We look forward to having you back in the Salon.\n\nWarm regards,\nLYN Salon"}<//Resp>< Text>
I love this place! As picky as I am when it gets to my nails, this salon surprised me with the best service I had in a while. Very neat, sophisticated, super fast service and super caring, friendly staff!!! They accept walk-ins which is very important for me since I'm very busy and barely have any time for anything. Kathy is amazing, does refills and acrylic super fast!!! I've never seen anyone work so fast and do an amazing perfect job!!!! I barely write any reviews, I just don't have time but this is my second visit and I just had to give them the credit!!! The best part is that the salon is right next to my house so yeah I feel blessed!!!! Check out my little wonders... Are you jealous yet?? That's Kathy's work... Go get your own girls!!😂👍👌< /Text>

Kathy did an amazing job! Perfect shape and not lumpy. A little bit on the pricey side but worth it. Also very friendly staff, Kathy made sure everything was perfect.</text>

Worst pedicure ever!! The lady literally cut my feet till they were bleeding. She ripped my cuticles to the point all of my toes were bleeding, and now I have cuts all on my feet. Highly Recommend going somewhere else. Not worth the money or pain.< /review>

<text>I love my nails by Emily and I've  received lots of compliments on her work. She was very thorough and detailed with the whole process. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she nailed it! I could tell Emily takes care to do nails like she would want done to her, she takes time to make them the right shape and clean around the edges, beautiful work!<//text>< pics>

<review>Pretty good except the person who did my nails caused a few to bleed. I know it happens but she did it 3 times and I was not stoked. Person who did the pedi did a great job. Affordable mani pedi for this part of town.< /review>< gmap_id>

<time>1553626260610<//time><rate>4<//rate><Review>What I will say is that my nails are bomb. They do a good pedicure and I've never gotten so many compliments on my nails... I am in Love with them. They're coffin shape, full set, ambre, pink and white, faded French manicure, obviously with 2 giant beautiful crystals, and matching glitter 😊😍 I would have given 5 stars but 1. The price shocked me and 2. I didn't know about it at all until I was walking out of the door.   It's like that moment when your mom made you put that toy back because it costs too much...but the store associate glued it to you so there's no going back now...but it hits your wallet instead of hers. Double whammy... 💔💔ugh ... I ended up coughing up $180 before I walking my cute nails out. 😞💅< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNZPEXlz5GKfz4SNKVIT56EEcxdxvWSSUPnEQ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c2bf27440de25f:0xaa1af90068e9f67c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Worst place over went to yesterday to get my wife’s nails done they give her the worst service and really bad job and rushed her out really fast and were really rude to my kids and talked bad about my wife stomach like if it matter to them how others look like. Look at the pictures how bad of a job they did. Called them about the nails and said it doesn’t matter and that it’s my problem.<//Review>

I went there the first time and my nails were all different shapes, I called and told them what happened and turns out it was the owner so I (stupidly) went back this time after being promised someone good would work on me WRONG I had some newbie who took 2 hours! Yes 2 hours for a fill I came in with almond nails and walked out with stilletoes I’m never going back here it’s a chop shop nail salon!<//Review>

I absolutely LOOOVE this nail salon. I have tried so many shops in the area & I was never happy in the end with my nails. Finally I tried Love Your Nails & now I will never go anywhere else! One of the staff did my nails. She is AMAZING! I swear she's the shape queen! Also this shop is very clean. It's comfortable. Professional. I would give 10 stars if I could!</review>

On the phone they said $20 for a fill and when I got there 3 of them speaking in another language wanted to charge me $45 after she removed color on 2 nails. Unethical business dealings. I told her to paint my two nails back, she did and I left.< /text>

<time>1545024381251< /time><rating>1< /rating><Text>DO NOT RECOMMEND. Just wanted to share with you the worst nail experience I’ve had. The service is pretentious and not friendly, non educated employees. Manicure was made very bad, my nails was hurting all night after that and was looking worse after manicure than before. The coverage is not even, have the leaks on the sides, and close to the cuticle, nothing is even. The surface of the acrylic nail wasn’t polished properly and the whole nail is uneven won’t bumps. Other than that one nail broke just 2 days after manicure when normally , even my natural bare nails never break.

Beside the horrible results I’d also would like to mention that the atmosphere in the salon is bad, bad culture of the owner, I’ve Been sitting there  with tree employee standing under me watching the nails being done after the first master failed to make it. I paid 80$ not to have people TRAIN on me how to do nails and wear a disaster. I admit I didn’t complain about it in the first place as the manicure took More then 3 HOURS, after I was back in the city after 1 week and went back to salon to share my bad experience, the owner didn’t want to fix anything.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Went to get my eyebrows wax and a quick polish changed. On the salon door it shows they are opened until 8:30p. Online it shows 9:30p. I walked in a 7:57p to be told that they were closing. I asked why do they promote later times if they aren’t willing to honor them and the lady rushed us out the door and told me to contact the owner. I called the owner for an explanation but received no answer or follow up. Everytime I try to go to this salon I am disappointed. I wanted something local to my apt but clearly this will NOT be the place with this type of service.< /text>

Kathy is the best! It was my 1st time getting my nails done at this nail salon. She took her time and was very knowledgable about her craft in nail artistry.
I went some were  else after her because she wasn't available  and hands down I won't be cheating on Kathy any more, her work speaks for itself!</review>

I've walked in this Friday and it was busy so I made an appointment for later at 3:30 but then when I showed up Joy was busy. I again made another appt. for 5:45. Lately, they seem over booked and rushed  -- which is why I can not give a five star as I would normally. In the past,  this salon was more organized and did not overbook.  I would give higher grade if they could keep their appts., and not be rushed when you are lucky to get a spot!! If this continues I will have to find another place but I really like Joy and her work (when she is NOT RUSHED). Hum....what should I do?< /review>

<username>Rayo Cole</username><time>1529785910854< /time><rating>1</rating><Text>Wow! This was the worst experience I have ever had in a nail salon! If you want horrible customer service, lumpy/bumpy acrylic nails, homophobic comments and a bad attitude, please go to Love Your Nails! I paid for an acrylic fill and a pedicure ($45). I asked for an additional foot massage after my pedicure  and the owner (Kathy) said they don't let people know they offer foot massages to avoid servicing lesbians who want massages from her female employees! She also said, "there are a lot of lesbians here because of West Hollywood!" She offered me the service  because she knew I wasn't a lesbian. I couldn't believe my ears! I am not a lesbian, however, I have many friends who are and they do not deserve to be refused service because of their sexual orientation. I have contacted GLAAD and will make sure that every gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender person in Los Angeles knows about this incident and avoids this salon at all cost. This is not ok! The owner clearly doesn't know that I work in the entertainment industry and will make sure that all of my colleagues in the media, etc will know about this. Kathy  is a foolish woman who doesn't understand basic business principles, customer service and treating all of her clients with respect no matter their race, sexual orientation or gender. If she has  an issue with lesbians, I'm sure she discriminates against other groups as well. Los Angeles is a city that embraces everyone despite their differences!

Secondly, the quality of their work is amateur and unprofessional. After applying my nail polish to my filled acrylic nails, you can see lumps and bumps from uneven acrylic work. I let Kathy know that I was unsatisfied with the job and she rudely barked at me instead of being understanding and fixing it for me. She told me she would have to charge me to change the polish ($10). I found this absurd because I'm not happy with the job. You didn't fill my nails properly and now you are asking me for additional money for a polish change? The bumps and lumps were magnified because of the light pastel color I chose . If the fill was correctly applied, the surface of the nails would be smooth and the color would look beautiful. I've never experienced this in my life! Other salons I have been to  are very accommodating if you aren't happy with their work. She began to yell and scream at me and tell me that my money isn't worth it. Today was my first time going to their salon and I will never return. I was so annoyed and asked my bank to stop payment. I let her know that I will be reporting my experience  on Yelp and she told me to also report her on google too ( which I am doing now) Her ego is ridiculous! DO NOT GO HERE! You have been warned!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>First and last time going to this place. Ordered an XXL pizza that took way too long. For us to get home and realize they didn’t put a white sheet under the pizza which made it extremely difficult to transfer for us to bake. A while and a mess later we reconstructed it. So basically just make your own pizza at home. Less wait and less mess. You’re welcome</text><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

< Review>
So sad to see what used to be the best pizza now taking short cuts. Last 2 times we ordered ahead to pick up at 11am. When we baked the pizza the crusts were hard and didn’t rise.
The second time, today, I called in to share my disappointment and find out the problem. The assistant shift manager admitted the pizza or dough may have been from the day before. We suspected this. I was told if we returned 2/3 we would be given a free replacement. Now really, too much  was served and who would have the time to return it, wait for a new one, then drive home, bake, then serve it. When I said we probably won’t order again she just said she was sorry and she would pass on my concern. No indication this wasn’t now standard practice. Either using up day old dough or unwilling to take the time to prepare fresh dough is unacceptable.</Review>

Kid behind counter handled money, used cash register then, without washing his filthy hands, made a pizza. All while, what must of been the manager, sat there and complained about how difficult it was to train the staff. Disgusting. I will not give them anymore business.< /Text>

<Review>Good food but the employee who answers the phone needs to be trained again. Called in my order to pick up . Then they tell me 30 minutes. Really to make 4 sandwiches.  Then I get there and they said we never ordered it. Had to order again and wait another 30 minutes. For 4 sandwiches.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><name>Bambi Slocum< /name><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>1<//Rate>< userid>

<Text>Horrible!! Was charged for PIZZA that I never got!! How are you going to charge for Combination Pizza and not deliver a Combination Pizza!! And say the BOSS told us to.
I spent almost a $100 and didn't get what we ordered. I think I stick with Papa Murphy's from now on!!.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I love Jeni's ice cream. The flavors are supreme.  There is a good variety of flavors to please everyone.  The one downer is the cost.  Sure it can cost more, it is better, but their prices are pretty steep for what you get compared to any other ice cream I've seen.  I don't get it often because of this, but love it when I do.  Something like $5.50 for a scoop or 2 half scoops of different flavors. A pint is $12.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c29e6baa521f53:0x3be750c6cd3f761f</gmap_id><user>107879840127082538816< /user><Response>None</Response></record>

They always have the best flavors and the employees are super friendly and helpful. If you don’t know what flavor to try, ask the employees. They definitely know the best ones. Also, the store is super clean which is a plus.<//review>

Their icecream is unique. They have flavors that are usually different than most icecream places but that is what makes Jeni's special. Don't come here expecting to get something ordinary like cookies and cream. I recommend instead asking what's good and trying something you've never had before.< /review>

< Review>
I have tbh. When this place first opened, I waited in the huge line w/ my little one and I wasn't impressed. Fast fwd to last month and I've got to say we love this place! Yes it cost more, but it's Calabasas and the quality is better. Thankfully, we live in Calabasas so it isn't far from us. No samples are allowed bc of Covid, but they will do a sampler type scoop thing and they can split a scoop into 2 flavors. I've tried their 🍌, 🍍 upside down and I have to say the gooey cake blows those flavors away! We used to love Salt & Straw, but I'd have to say Jeni's is on par and Afters isn't even close.< /Review>

These Ice Creams were delicious! Next time I'd just get the cake and not the soft serve. However if you like soft serve, they give you a lot! This is definitely a unique place and a must try!</Review>

<Review>Jeni's always a favorite (9 distinct pints in the freezer) but still had to make an outing to try some of the new flavors.  Love this location.  Ridiculously posh surroundings courtesy of Calabasas.  Step up from the old digs in the Short North.  Got the trio of Atlantic Beach Pie, Watermelon Taffy, and Orange Blossom Chiffon.  Highly recommend all three and this location!</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
First off, I'm impressed with the Covid safety measures that they put in place. The workers are very careful not to touch/contaminate your icecream. They wear hair nets, gloves, and masks throughout the whole process - completely contactless. The only downside is that you can no longer sample flavors.

As for the ice cream, they have a lot of interesting flavors to choose from. You can get either a large scoop or two or three halves  of different flavors if you want to mix and match. If you like ice cream cones, you can choose between either cake or sugar cone. I had the sugar cone which was really good.

Overall, I had a very positive experience, and will likely be back soon.</Review>

Aboailutlet delicious ice cream. This may be my new favorite ice cream place. The staff is very friendly and let you try lots of flavors. Every ice cream flavor there I’d never tried elsewhere, and each one was better than the last. I recommend the butter something cake and the brambleberry one.</Text>

Fabulous place!  Bought a pint of Coffee with Cream and Sugar for my husband, who tasted it and said "I'll be eating that in one sitting!"  And the staff are great - I had a long drive home and they put my pint in a bag with ice, so it was still frozen when I got home.  Yay Jeni's!</Review>

<review>My husband and I wanted dessert after eating at Sugarfish, and I'm so glad we stumbled upon this ice cream place! It's a cute small ice cream shop that serves unique and delicious flavors.
We shared a trio of almond brittle, banana brûlée, and gooey butter cake.
All 3 were so good, I would've gotten a second order of it!
Our favorite was the gooey butter cake. We actually went to the Topanga mall, then drove back afterwards to buy 2 pints of the gooey butter cake to take home. It's pricey though, $12/pint. Since I'm from San Diego, I decided to search places that carry their ice cream and found that a few Whole Foods and local markets sell them!! Makes me happy.
So if you're in this area, you have to try this place for a yummy sweet treat!</review>< Pictures>

This is my absolute favorite ice cream place of all time and it always will be. Everytime I go to the commons, I tell myself not to get ice cream, but walking by, I can't resist. The smell of this place is just so warm and happy that I must go inside and just "look at the ice cream". Obviously I end up getting some and I normally get the Butter Cake one (I forgot the name). This ice cream place is amazing and you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors but I highly recommend the Butter Cake one.< /text>

Or not so splendid? The place was packed, and the line was very long. I was disappointed by the dairy-free frosé flavor, instead of a fruit cocktail or rosé, it came up "canned pears". My friends all enjoyed their ice creams in various flavors< /review>

This place has become our weekend tradition. We find ourselves coming here more and more often. Our kids love this place and to be honest I think we do more and use them as an excuse to go eat ice cream. In this case I wish there was a 10 star because this place would definalty deserve it. The taste is amazing and with the combination of taste and aroma we are forever faithful. Thank you for the quality we can taste and appreciate. Customer service is great too.< /Review>

<Text>Excellent ice cream! Unique flavors with quality ingredients. This location is a little small, but provided the weather is nice, the outdoor seating is a good option.< /Text>< username>

This place just recently opened and our first experience was a great one! They have many flavors to choose from! Very interesting ones. I went with espresso and whiskey pecan! My son had pumpkin spice! Our server was excellent! He was VERY knowledgeable and informative but in a very humble way. Nice seating. Wish the cool old fashion soda was cheaper. Glad this is here though! We’ll be back!</Text>

<text>$6 for half-scoops? Thanks for gracing me with the courtesy of a half-scoop. This place goes against what ice cream shops stand for (yes, compared to the other "designer" ones too). At least make it a full scoop. It's absurd. A rip-off. You want more than a half-scoop when you get ice cream, don't you?<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I first hand Jeni's waaay back in Columbus in 2005. Flashforward to me moving across country and stumbling upon Jeni's here, I almost cried tears of joy. Always delicious, always full of fresh and interesting flavors, this place will ruin all other ice cream shops. Brambleberry Crisp and and Brown Butter Almond Brittle are must try staples, but don't be afraid to branch out!< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>Food was delicious and super healthy as well as priced very well for the seared ahi poke salad. I was also able to customize my plate. The elderflower lavender lemonade was perfectly sweet. Had a great lunch with my friend at their nice seating area outside!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXVWaaBjDp6KZKIzYAi_L5O_lrezTFxsxO8bw6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOF7Fne28U6Qivzkj1ov8a64OKV1bv7TGmdHo4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8WLH_kxKQIk1hytj20Z7PfASJUqEh364QqDGO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO86Lizn3p3wOXLbAwyIVA0rdtLowhjMYJNPsgx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWAQ7LTYJSkhujJ9GlGOurnHpJN2UDzbwSmdNb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiYRf0PoheJPD-5LhURHdFHC3sxc-RiQZonr_X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3hUskqTm6CG9GBbhttP1lmEBykqctBcLlxjO-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Rating>5< /Rating><Name>Jessica Hull</Name>< Resp>

<Text>Don’t order their poke bowls, it’s not poke when there’s only 5 pieces of poke in it. Also portions were uneven, sometimes more sometimes less, and a bit pricey for what you get. We stopped by here cause we were in the area and I wanted poke, but craving was not satisfied will have to go get poke somewhere else this week ...<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c0fe6778aa85:0x90573a895066d9c4</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>We did not care too much for the lemonade, tasted like water with a spoon of sugar. I think the meals are a little over price because they have so much rice in the bottom. Some locations use a shallow bowl others use a deep bowl.</text>< pics>

<review>Me and the Mrs. stopped here for spicy Hawaiian poke bowls. The ingredients were perfect, well proportioned, and the entire bowl was scrumptious and delicious. Or is it delicious and scrumptious? I don't know, but either way, we both loved it! I got the one with the white rice and Mama's got the one with the brown rice. Can we destroy both of those bowls!!< /review>< pictures>

The salmon looked and tasted terrible like it was sitting there for a long time. Two side orders  were beets/pasta salad and cherry tomatoes/mozzarella salad and those didn’t taste fresh either! They serve food that is just sitting there for weeks and the plate costs $18!!!!!  Please save your money and pick different place!< /review>

The service was really bad. Really had a bad experience in this location. My sister and came here for lunch. The place werent busy, my sister and i were the only ones in line. There were at several people behind the counter, a couple were replenishing the the hot food while the other five were just standing there. The woman who was asstisting me with my order just all the sudden stopped processing my order and went to counter and assists some girls who wants some drinks. So first why did she just stop with my order. Why didnt she let the other people assists them. Whh didnt she tell them that's actually a line. Then i had to repeat myself on telling them my sister still needs help no one out of the few people standing there even bothered to ask her or offered some assistants. I dont recommend this place to anyone not unless you know people who works there.< /text>

<Text>I heard about this place recently so I decided to give them a try. I saw they had poke and ordered it to go. The food here was really good. It took us a long time to figure out the menu though. It was very confusing. We almost left because of it but glad we stayed because the food was very fresh and tasty and there were lots of healthy choices. The food came out pretty quickly and the poke was delicious. Very fresh fish and great tasting. I highly recommend.<//Text>< Pics>

I used to like lemonade. Several years ago the food concept and options were unique and healthy for a place like this. But now... Lots of other restaurants have appeared on the map and lemonade hasn't kept up.

You can feel it from the moment you walk in, it's just lost that energy. The food is decent, don't get me wrong, but they haven't changed seemingly anything since they opened.

It's getting really hard to justify the cost of lunch or dinner here. I doubt I'll be going anymore.< /Text>

Delicious sandwiches. I'm lactose intolerant, and they were able to sub the cheese for something else. Very kind of them and understanding. The chicken/greenbeans side was also quite good. Will definitely come here again.</review>

I personally prefer the blood orange and apparently its the most popular there as well. If you're in the area and need a refreshing drink this place isn't bad!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

We walked by this place constantly and always thought it was just a drink shop because of the name, but low and behold they have a huge selection great food.  They offer bowls, salads, entrees, poke, all kinds of stuff.

We stopped in for a quick lunch and had the BBQ brisket bowl, and salmon, and the white truffle Mac and cheese (to die for)

Pleasantly surprised, will come again for sure</text>

First of all, I LOVE LEMONADE! its my favorite drink, so this review is a little bias. Great flavors, price point is perfect and the food menu is pretty good as well. Will stop at the LAX location before heading home. Wish there were locations in FL.< /Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Lemonade is a fairly popular informal place to grab a salad, wrap or fusion drink. They offer a variety of salads with a sign outside showing daily specials. Many are fish based. They also offer a variety of fusion drinks/teas blended with different fruits. Pricing is moderate and a little silly in some cases. Purified water should not be $2.50 a bottle. Service is fine.<//Review>< pictures>

Cute place. Everything looks delish. Really liked the BLT, but something was wrong with the Mac n cheez. None of the kids finished them. Might have been overly salty.

Also... They have one gender neutral bathroom thats missing a changing table</Text>

Really delicious, fresh food and specialty lemonades. Menu has cold salads, some vegetarian options as well as warm sides and fish/meat. Kind of pricey for what you get, ordered two sides, a cup of soup and lemonade, it was over $15. Would still eat at Lemonade again.< /text>

My comparison would be to Urban Plates and that just hits my wheelhouse so much more. Lemonade feels a little cold inside; the actual lemonade is quite good though and some of their cold dishes are good. I just wouldn't hurry up to go again.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>What I love the most about Lemonade is the consistency to provide food at any location with the same quality as all their other locations. I like to try different things every time, but their desserts are what gets me the most (so fluffy, so delicious, so gooooooood). Of course you gotta try some of their various flavored lemonades. You won't regret your visit.<//Review>< pictures>

We were out in California for a week and ate here multiple times. We loved it! All the food we had was great, all flavors of lemonade were amazing, and the macaroons were huge and some of the best we’ve had! Can’t wait to be back in the area to have this again!<//Text>

I am a HUGE fan of Lemonade. I'll almost always pick Lemonade over any store if I know it's in the area.   Food is always great! I highly recommend the white truffle Mac and cheese. You will not regret it!  My favorite lemonades are the blood orange and guava, though I believe the guava was only temporary or seasonal. Their lemonade are about $3 and only come in one size. I always ask for easy ice since it's already cold!  Their macarons are OKAY at best. Since I don't consider them to be an expert on French macarons anyway, I wouldn't judge them too harshly on that. Their macarons are as large as your palm, so the price of $4 isn't too much to ask for.   I recently tried their cheesecakes in a jar. At $5.95 a pop, I wouldn't exactly hurry back to buy another. I bought the blood orange cheesecake which wasn't as tart-y as I expected it to be, and the graham cookie crumble was exactly what it was--cookie crumble! I would say skip this dessert idea as they have a wider variety of others to choose from.   All in all, I would highly recommend Lemonade as the consistency in food quality and customer service remains the same across the board. Because of that, I know that I'll remain a loyal customer.</review>

<Review>We really really wanted to love this place as much as we love the one on Abbott Kinney. We parked the car, passed it, checked out the food around 4:30pm in the empty place - and I mean really empty. No one there. The food looked awesome - so we decided to have dinner there - and went shopping. Back 6:30, one table occupied - and still the same food we saw at 4:30 - dry, cold (my wife's salmon stone cold) or overcooked (my pasta).

We understand why the place was still empty and wonder how long it can survive until it will have to close for good. A shame really, as we generally love the concept and this one would have been close to our home. Abbott Kinney is an hour or more away, but I'd rather drive there than try this one again :-(< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2c0fe6778aa85:0x90573a895066d9c4< /gmap_id>< Response>

Amazing. Looks are deceving.  Trust me... Go ask for samples.

Denise is a role model for hospitality.

Interesting food location. But the food I received was not hot only lukewarm and was way too salty. Probably will not return.< /Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Given the wide variety of items here they really need to provide a printed or posted menu of the day. The line queue system here makes it virtually impossible to see what's available (especially when its busy), which forces you to look/push around people to see the various items. Haven't yet been disappointed with the food here (thought it is somewhat pricey) but the line situation is a killer and makes me wary of returning.<//text>< Pictures>

Let's talk about healthy healthy and healthy. From the second I walked in I fell in love with the white and yellow interior. It has a very fun interior. And the giant glass window with the delicious food behind it made me feel like I'm window shopping for something luxurious.
They explained to me how there are ready made plates and bowls to choose from, but I can also make my own plate. I decided to go with one of the ready made plates: The Big Chill which includes: 1 choice of Land & Sea, 2 Marketplace Salads and 1 fresh Baked Crips which is cheese dread dried. I choice ahi tuna poke as my choice of Land & Sea along with roasted curry Cauliflower salad and Avocado cherry tomato salad. However, I did have the pleasure of tasting other items such as the seaweed tuna poke, the Brussels spouts, and the pesto pasta salad. They were all out of this world delicious.
Then came to fun part: picking out a lemonade!!! *DUHH*
I tried a few like the watermelon mint lemonade and strawberry lemonade but my taste buds wanted the cucumber mint lemonade so I picked that. I also got a pistachio giant macaroon to save for later.
I partnered up with a fellow Yelper and we got down to business. The "ooohs" and "ahhhs" started with each bite. I was in heaven. The poke was so fresh, the avocado cherry Tomato salad was so delicious and light. It was cold so it even tasted better. The curry cauliflower was just exploding with flavor. Everything worked so incredibly well together. And to top it off the Baked Crips gave the whole plate a nice crunch. It was fantastic!
Not to forget about the watermelon mint lemonade, it was very refreshing and not too sweet, which is how I like my lemonade.
I saved the macaroon for later and I ate it when I got home and to no surprise it was very moist and delicious.
Before I left to got to talk to one of the employees, Allie, about the history of Lemonade and how it started. Allie told me that Lemonade started in 2008 and they already have 26 locations in all of California. How incredible is that?! And then she pointed at the side wall which has a map of some of their locations drawn out, labeling the locations with some plates. It was a very cool and creative art piece.
P.S. Lemonade provides a 2 hour validation for the Americana parking lot.</Text>

<date>1619899005983<//date><Rating>4</Rating><Text>The most dishes that I like is their Hot pot of Bimbimbo ( with little bit ground beef and other
Vegetables , Rice on bottom ) you can add a Tofu soup ( 4 different choices), $ 16.99+tax - l love this dishes .
They have BBQ meats that you can Grill yourself on table . ( better check prices before you go )

I'm not a big meat eater . So I don't order From main menu . I order from regular menu . ( have lot of choices on there )

You can sit inside or ask for outdoor dining . ( but don't eat and run away , OK ) business hard to do now .

Don't take restaurant advantages , that's really not
nice . If you don't have enough money , just go to market get produce and meat to cook at home by yourself .</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Nice local place. Service is great. They are always friendly. Happy they're opening for all you can eat during this pandemic. They have seating outside so you could grill your own meat at the table :) quality of meat is not the best, but it helps the cravings, and for anyone living on the west side and not wanting to travel all the way to Koreatown, this is a good place to go to.<//text>

I love this local kbbq!!! The price has creeped up a bit, but its still reasonable and great food. Seating is outside and there can be a bit of a wait, but its worth it. Usually there's one person serving everyone,  but the precautions taken are great! I am more than happy to support a local place like Galbi King!! I was a customer before, during and will continue to be after the pandemic!</Text>

Still the best AYCE on the westside.  Food quality is reliable and service is friendly although sometimes you have to make a huge effort to get their attention as there are only two people working the entire dining room.  Variety of meats is good and the six banchan are solid.  Tofu soup is also yummy!<//Review>

A good place to go. Although the menu is relatively short, the price is friendly. Good place to go if you just want to have unlimited proteins (at average quality) and beer with friends.</Review>

This site is my favorite place.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this restaurant. Whenever  I I need a superb lunch, this place comes immediately to my head. outstanding and diverse  food and a rich cuisine.professional team, and great ambience. Not less important, the cost is fair. I suggest this place with no hesitation.< /Text>

This is a great place to crawl over to after work with friends or coworkers. The staff are super nice and super attentive (very important for AYCE!) The Beef Short-Rib is excellent! The Beef Brisket is 8/10 (a little dry but not bad!) Bulgogi is spot on and the Banchan (side dishes) are generously proportioned with a wide variety.

You get a lot for your money for the all you can eat bbq. The short ribs are awesome. What I don't like is that they sell soda by the can and there are no free refills<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>This place is great!! The spicy chicken lunch box is fantastic. Comes with two sushi rolls, white rice, two pork dumplings, salad, ginger, and onions under the chicken. It's only 9.99. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the onions they put under the chicken. That gives an illusion of more chicken but in fact loads of onions. If they can fix that then 5 stars. This place is also all you can eat.

11.1.2019 Update: They really listened and put more chicken less onion. Giving this a 5 now!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

<review>As good as KBBQ gets on the westside, I still prefer Quaters  in Ktown, but this is conveniently located on the west side. It is all you can eat for $20 for 2 hours, so come hungry. I enjoyed the bulgogi and the spicy tofu soup.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaqWaf4-exhg_63spICvA0ncGufmYd4Xi5yn7j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bbae8744edfd:0x33b277a2ab4a38f</gmap_id></record>

But the quality is just not worth it. The brisket had no taste. Had to drench it in "brown sauce". Out of 5 meats 1 was the best. It was #2 on menu of choice. The egg wasn't bad either. Slim choice but cheap price. Rather go to k town or gyu<//text>< UserId.>

Very rude service. Made my group of 3 people wait 10 minutes and ignored us while trying to get their attention. Definitely do not recommend due to poor service. They acted rushed even though most tables were empty and no line.</text>

<review>So me and the family decided to try something new. We searched some sites and saw that third place had some good reviews. Sad to say that I think they are pretty much wrong.

The portions were very generous for a family of 4. It's all you can eat and you could eat your fill in the 2 hours they allot you. The tofu soup is very flavorful and had just the right amount of kick.

The meat is something else. We tried the squid, beef tongue,  chicken, bulgur and marinated beef. The cuts were a bit fatty and chewy and lacked flavor. The side dishes are tasty but nothing special. Sadly I can't really recommend this place except for the friendly staff.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Some kind of smell in the restaurant. I couldn't put my finger on what it was. But from then on I was nervous. At some point in the cooking I felt hot oil hit my knee. The grill is not well made. At the bottom it looks like a DIY cover on the grill that's why there was oil coming out. The ceiling and the vents are gross. I took a peak in the kitchen and it looked gross. Honestly I think they need to work on cleanliness and get some structure. I always say cleanliness is indicative of their mindset so they bring that same sloppy mindset to their food quality and standards.</Review><Response>None< /Response></record>

<Review>My first time here today. The place is small the wait was long.  The service was terrible and rushed , they didn't asked us for our drink orders and when we ordered the first round it was a mountain of meat.. we didn't even get thru half of it. It was a waste and no room to try other meats .. It had no flavor and the sides were to match.. nothing from this place is worth trying it for a second time.. the staff was in a rush rude mode .  The only ones who we could actually ask and catch for questions were the buss boys which were somewhat helpful.. I do not recommend this place at all.< /Review>< rate>

<Review>I came here with some friends because we were too lazy to drive to Ktown. If you’re in the same predicament, just make the drive. The meat here was okay, but it was below average. The sides tasted stale and old, and the cuts of meat lacked flavor. Also, there was just one server and it took forever for us to get meat or our grill changed.

All in all I won’t be returning.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The few times I’ve been here the service has been good. Sometimes a bit slow but it’s dependent on how busy they are. You can even sit at a table where you don’t have to worry about cooking. It defeats the purpose but it’s a good way for anyone that just wants to try out the food that doesn’t require a fire in front of you.<//Review>< name>

I've revised my review down to two stars, because the last time I visited I was told there were no tables for one, but a couple that showed up after me was seated promptly. Poor customer service, and the seafood soon tofu is not fresh and is pretty tasteless compared to others I've had.<//Review>

This place is by far my favorite local korean restaurant.  Not only is this place inexpensive, but the food is amazing.  I would recommend the soon tofu soup.  The spice level indicator is something to watch out for.  If you like a lot of spice then get medium, but if you like insane spice, then get a spicy.  Even the mild has a decent amount of spice.  One amazing restaurant!< /review>

I love Galbi King. Great all you can eat kbbq on the west side. I'm Celiac and they have a good selection of unmarinated meats (I'd like some kalbi too, but beggars can't be choosers). One of my favorite places to eat when I'm in town.< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>$20 for cheap KBBQ, albeit poorer quality? SURE!  That might be the closest thing to Ktown out here on the westside for a while.  If anyone knows any other KBBQ out here, please PM me.

We got the brisket (thin and stuck to the grill), tongue (loved this - they do not skimp), bulgogi, squid, short ribs (yums), the steamed egg, and bibimbop.  The banchan is pretty standard - not the most flavorful, but I'll eat it - maybe I should ask for some sauce for it.

It is worth it for me, so I'm giving it 4 stars.< /Review>< Response>

Good kbbq, especially for the west side. Sometimes it gets pretty busy and there can be long waits. Also, service is typically on the brisk side (not personally a problem). Would recommend more during off-peak times.< /Review>

<Review>The staff was very rude, let us wait for long time while he talked to the "diswasher sales guy". They refused to serve us BBQ, they said they have big party coming, but it was 2pm and the lunch time ended at 3pm. They only want serve us from the menu... Within the time (less than 1 hour) we will not have more than one round, the reason of "big party" later doesnt make sense... I will never come back again...< /Review>< Pics>

They certainly like to delay the second order and if you got for thirds they get amnesia and the portions drop.  It's as if they're trained to make you feel uncomfortable if you truly exercise the all-you-can-eat option ;)< /review>

<Review>Very affordable all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ place. Short beef rib and black pork belly are my favorite.

+ Affordable
+ Lively environment w/ people drinking and talking

- Need at least 2 persons for A.Y.C.E
- Not that clean
- Food quality is just average</Review>< time>

First of all I've worked as food server and bartender for many years and supported my family relying on tips money , but always making sure i provided EXCELLENT SERVICE to my customers EARNING my tips, this guy just want tips with his bad attitude? no way!

I ALWAYS TIP WELL SPECIALLY IF I GOT GOOD SERVICE FROM THE SERVERS AND BARTENDERS.

And as the waiter told me , we are not coming back to this place!< /Review>< Name>

<review>Wow! Was anyone else’s stomach doing 360 somersaults 30 mins after leaving the restaurant because mine was. Beef was horrible, bad quality meat all round, awful customer service as they threw our plates down and floors were slimey. Let’s hope I don’t wake in the middle of the night running to the toilet.<//review>< pics>

< review>
One of the few if not only Korean barbecues on the Westside. Food is really good, and lots of it. It's great fun to cook your own meats and vegetables on the grill, and you also get a lot of side dishes and sauces. There's often a wait for a table at this place. Service levels are all over the place. Some staff are friendly, patient and attentive. Others, in particular the 'main guy' who's been there forever and works just as hard as anyone, is often gruff and somewhat rude, it's just how he is and we ignore it. This is a really fun spot and no one leaves hungry.</review>

The non-bbq food here is pretty atrocious. Their steamed egg tasted heavily like tap water and their banchan and kimchi dolsot(what I ordered) was extremely lackluster. Maybe I should have gotten the BBQ at a BBQ place but this was not worth eating.</Text>

<Review>Above average, turn and burn all you can eat kbbq. Service is kinda lacking and staff was a bit gruff, but the quality of the food almost completely makes up for it. And at 20 bucks a head for ayce, a very solid choice<//Review>< Pictures>

Great service.  It can get really busy here.  Expect a line up if you come at regular meal times.  I had to wait about 45 min.
It's a good all you can eat place.  They love bbq meat here.</Review>

If I could give this restaurant a zero stars I would. I've always been to this restaurant and service is ok I only come because it is close to my house but today when me and my husband came into the restaurant before taking order the service said " if you are going to eat here you have leave a tip!" I looked at him and said excuse me! He says " you guys never leave a tip when you eat here." I said " we always leave a tip either I pay with a card and leave a cash tip or the other way around" then he said " well if you have write on the receipt cash tip that would be nice" I have never been so disrespected in a restaurant and me and my husband works in the food industry so we know how important tip are to the establishment and there employees! And to be honest the only reason he remember me and my husband because we are Black and Mexican couple point blank!< /review>

Buffet was just OK in terms of quality and quantity. Other than the marinated short ribs, everything else was bland. Pork belly was a big letdown. Many better AYCE  options in Korea Town. Service was indifferent<//review>

$20, all you can eat. Not as many choices as other places, but for the price, it's excellent - recommend the pork belly, bibimbap was a little disappointing.</Review>

We came here blindly without any expectations. They don't play around when it comes to portions. They fill up each order with enough meat to fill you up and not ask for more. The bulgogi is probably a favorite here. A+<//review>

<text>Very solid kbbq place on the Westside. Actually, pretty much the only place, which I assume is why they fall short on some places, though that's not to say it's not a good spot to stop if you want kbbq and you don't have the time/patience for a trip to k-town!

The meat is served in HUGE portions, no matter the party size, which is a bit discouraging if you want to try a lot of different things; definitely not the place for that, more like if you know what you want! Quality is pretty good, nothing to complain about, and the seasoning on the marinated meats are fine. Honestly, you can't really beat the price/quality ratio at this place.

Side dishes included are fish cake strips, bean sprouts, kimchi (traditional and cucumber), glass noodles, and potato salad. They're all standard and compliment the meal well. I really like the different soups that come with the AYCE menu, especially the tofu soup. It's irritating that some of the employees include soup orders as a single item, especially if there's a big group because then only one or two people can get soup in order to not limit the number of meats you can order at once, though some others are more reasonable about it. Service overall is pretty meh, but nothing so horrible that I'd stop going.

Must tries of the meat cuts are beef belly, pork belly, spicy chicken (don't over cook it! Cut it into pieces so you can feel safe about consumption!) and spicy squid. The beef tongue is a bit of a let down, but if you're comfortable having it very rare it works. Overall, a totally okay spot if you're really in the mood for KBBQ.< /text>< Pics>

For $20, all you can eat.

High-quality meat. Good service. Attracts hipster young professionals crowd.

I liked the galbi and bulgogi.< /Text>

<review>Great foo, and if you get the all u can eat BBQ for $20, it is very worth it. I knocked off a star because they don't allow for reservations, even for bigger parties. Service isn't that great. The server we had was arrogant and rude and we were not greeted by anyone until we were seated. It not asking for a lot just to say "hello"< /review>< Pics>

Lovers of food need only apply.

You want delicious all you can eat KBBQ without any BS, this is your place! You want to be treated like your butt don't stinky stink, pampered like royalty, face wiped for you & served like the easily bruised snowflake you are? Then this place isn't for you.

Very reasonable prices & solid selection. Make sure you get everything as specified, don't be shy to ask for it if your server forgets. Especially the soup that's included in the AYCE menu. Expect to wait about 20-30 minutes to get a table. More during peak times. If you show up ~1 hour before close, they won't kick you out at closing but don't expect sweet words to be whispered in your ear. Chow down, drink up & GTFO.
Let me be clear, I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! <3 <3 <3< /Text>

All you can eat with 2 or more people is good deal. Includes tofu soup and a few other options not usually included. Short ribs, beef/pork belly are my top picks for meat<//review>

Run of the mill Korean Barbeque.  The quality of the meat is just OK, but that's probably to be expected since they are an all-you-can-eat joint. Service is decent, but can be spotty depending on how busy they are.< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>For an ayce kbbq in West LA, you don't really have much of a choice, but for what it's worth, this place is not bad and not expensive. Meats were okay, good side dishes, most of my favorites were included: rice paper, cucumbers, potato salad. Menu is pretty good for $20, selection is better than some places in Gardena, but quality may not be as good. Parking is a little limited, but at night, bank parking is available. Worth coming here to not deal with traffic.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Talk about Bar-B-Q
AT YOUR TABLE
CAN YOU SAY ON DECK
ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!!!!!!
So much food
You cannot take it home
So portion your food
It is all you can eat.....
Meat
Chicken AMAZING
SERVICE IS AMAZING
Place is abit small
Parking is really bad
Place in shopping center
Do not eat all day if you are coming here
Expect to wait for a table at least 30-40-60 mins
Yep
The wait and lines are long
But it is all
Worth it !!!!!!!!!
AMAZING FOOD !!!!!!!</review>

Average experience here.

Came here with four other people and didn't wait too long. That was nice, especially for coming at a pretty average dinner time.

Meat was alright. Have to say that their beef tongue is really good and would definitely recommend! Other meats were pretty average quality. Not amazing, but not terrible either. Also liked most of their side dishes, but the kimchi was a bit too sour, in my opinion.

The store seemed really understaffed the day we went in. There were two workers that were running around filling requests and taking orders. Because of this, a lot of things we asked for were forgotten and never brought to us. I felt bad for the two workers and hope they really hire some more people because they seemed very stressed.

Also, they serve water from a bucket? I saw them get water from a bucket to fill people's cups. It seemed that the bucket was clean, but it was a little bit concerning.

Also, there is parking in the back.</text>

Its cheap and pretty good kbbq place to visit with friends. The location is somewhat hidden so you kind of have to keep your eye out for the door.</Text>

It's more expensive, but the food is good. It can get very busy and the service seems to be so-so. Not much else to be said.</text>

<rating>4</rating><text>Galbi King is a 4 star Korean BBQ spot because:
1) It's on the Westside
2) You can get a ton of food
3) The people speak English
4) It's possible to get a seat at non-peak times pretty easily

If you compare Galbi King to some of K-Town's best, there's no way it's a 4 star restaurant. However, the location and convenience of being able to stay on this side of town for AYCE Korean BBQ alone matters for a lot.

The quality of the meat is ok. The service can be frantic (they really need another person). But ultimately, you get a ton of food for under $20. Don't go here expecting the best of K-Town and you'll be more than satisfied with the location and value.</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2bbae8744edfd:0x33b277a2ab4a38f< /GmapID></record>

Good food for reasonable prices, the only problem I have is sometimes on the weekends the line and wait can be horrendous. Just call ahead to see how long the wait will be. Other than that, only good place on the west side I could find without going to Koreatown.<//Text>

Otherwise, way to expensive if you are by yourself and want the fun of an all you can eat kbbq.  $50 for an individual, and they won't let you order the all you can eat for $19.95 unless you have more than 1 person. When asked if I could just buy 2 AYCE to save the extra $10, they said no way. Anyway, much to costly for strip mall kbbq!< /Text>< pics>

The only AYCE kbbq spot on the Westside. Went a few times at lunch and the staff, all one person, is overwhelmed with customers. But ready to take a 2.5hr lunch if you want to eat here. Overall, the fit quality is pretty good, they even offer hotstone bibimbop as part of their AYCE menu. If they add more waiters/waitresses I'll definitely update the stars for this review.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) An all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ for $ 19.95 per person.
The price, the volume, the deliciousness and the staff are good and satisfying.
There are not many kinds of menu, but I am satisfied because there are popular meats.
I think that it is better to ask little by little because you can not eat if you ask too much because the amount of one item is too much.
Rest assured that there is also parking on the back.

(Original)
1人19.95ドルで食べ放題の韓国BBQ。
値段もボリュームも美味しさもスタッフも良くて満足できます。
メニューの種類はあまりないですが人気のお肉はあるので満足です。
一品の量も多いので頼み過ぎると食べきれないので少しずつ頼むのがいいと思います。
裏にパーキングもあるので安心。<//text>< userid>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) I ate a barbecue restaurant that was 100 meters away from the residence for three years. I used to eat almost every week before, but I still thought about it after I moved away! In fact, nothing special, but the strong smell of fireworks in the city just makes me want to stop!
I was surprised to find that Casey Neistat came to LA and eaten here too!

(Original)
吃了三年离住处一百米远的烧烤店，以前几乎每周都来吃，后来搬走了还是会想！其实没什么特别，但浓浓的市井烟火味就是让我欲罢不能！
发现Casey Neistat来LA也来这家吃过，有点意外！< /Review>
