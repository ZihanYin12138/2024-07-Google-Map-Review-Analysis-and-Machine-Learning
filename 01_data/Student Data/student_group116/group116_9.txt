< Review>
My family has been using Banfield for all of our pets for the past 15+ years and I started bringing my own puppy recently, however I can't be loyal if the service is continuously subpar.

It has now happened three times where I arrive to the appointment and call for a check-in, however no one responds. The first two times, someone finally picked up after 15 or so minutes and they were able to take my dog. Frustrating but passable. This last time I sat for 30 minutes calling to check-in and when they finally picked up, they let me know that I had missed my dog's appointment. They acknowledged that they couldn't pick up the phone because there was only one person available to answer and that there were many calls, therefore my call went unanswered.

Instead of fitting my dog in, they asked me to drop her off for a 6pm pickup when her appointment was at 10:30am. So I left my puppy, who had only had breakfast, through 6pm, having her miss two meals. This was the only option they gave me and said they would give her "a treat". No idea whether they did or not.

I think the vets at this location have been knowledgeable but the service isn't worth continuing to be a loyal customer. There are plenty of great vets with better service for customers. Definitely take your pet somewhere that can provide the support and professionalism you're expecting so your time taken off from work is met with the same respect you have given by being on time -- you won't consistently find that here.</Review>

They need to communicate what is being provided during appointments and not wait for the pet parents to ask. They are the “experts” so they should clearly provide this information, especially to the new pet parents. Never saw or spoke to the Veterinarian during my 2 visits. Cancelled our 3rd appointment and going to the other location.</text>

I had an awful experience with this hospital. I recommend you to look carefully about the things they charge you - they charged me differently from what even we agreed with and lied about the service they provided.

In August, I took my dog to this hospital for dental cleaning and teeth extraction surgery. That experience was OK, the doctor told me there were still two more teeth need to be removed, so I just need to make an appointment for teeth extraction next time.

I did it and specifically told the nurse this time no dental cleaning, and she acknowledged. Before the surgery, another doctor gave me the estimate(no details, just the total number), I trusted their expertise and didn’t ask questions about it. Last Friday, when I dropped off my dog for the appointment, the nurse confirmed with me " this will be no dental cleaning and just teeth extraction surgery." When I picked up my dog in the evening, the nursed told me that even though my dog didn’t have dental cleaning this time, she managed to scrub off some residues from the teeth.

I was so confused when I got the bill because they charged me for a dental cleaning. When I called them, they told me the manager will call me, I waited for two days, and they never called. I called again. They started to claim the dental cleaning is required before the surgery which I thought is ridiculous. Do you really need to remove the tartar from the teeth that you eventually going to extract? Nevertheless to mention he just had the dental cleaning two months ago! What’s more important, those staffs have confirmed it with me that there wouldn’t be/wasn’t a dental cleaning.

Eventually, they started to blame me for approving the bill and said there's nothing they can do about it. I honestly feel sorry for those staff who work hard at this hospital - my first experience wasn't bad. However, it's not a trustworthy hospital as a whole.</review>

Normally I would go to a privately owned veterinarian.

But due to some Bad choices with insurance banfield was  Where we had to go.

Honestly if your dog is sick take itout and shoot it in the head before bringing it to these con artists.

I have never had a problem before with any other  Banfield Pet Hospital except for this one in Daly City the people there are not nice, they  don’t make any effort in  help or guidance the customers they are very rude.
I do recommend Banfield Pet Hospital but the other locations, it’s a clear reason why the Daly City location always have open availability because no one wants to bring their pets back here.<//text>

< Review>
My family and I have been going to this specific location for YEARS since we adopted our first Maltese, then our first Yorkie, and then our two Morkie babies. We've always had extremely great experiences with every member of the staff here!

However, the last encounter we had (August 1st) was with the nastiest receptionist we've ever encountered. I asked my mother to help me pick up my Yorkie as I was out of town. He needed a physical and we were told he was due for shots (thank you Banfield for letting us know!) but as she picked Toby up, she was not asked to sign ANY FORMS, NOR was she given any of the usual paper work after a visit.

She soon after had to take my grandfather to his dialysis appointment when she received a call from Banfield, from a rude and angry male receptionist stating she had not signed the required forms to discharge Toby?? Mind you, she doesn't speak the best English and she had no idea she had done any wrong doing. She told the male receptionist she can come after she drops off my grandfather to which he became rude and NOT understanding, implying she needed to drop what she was doing to come back to sign these "forms" that she did not even know about.

Banfield, we love you but retrain your staff to have better communication in interactions with customers. How my mother was treated is NOT okay and we are still trying to learn this male receptionist's name.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I really felt disrespected, angry, spent a lot of money and was treated like this. First of all, I have two cats, a boy a girl, two into the clinic to make vaccine and physical examination, and finally I got my test results prove that the doctor misspelled the genders of the one, the girls as boys. Are you seriously checking my cat? I doubt it because COVID-19 is not something we can wait for and accompany my pet in the clinic. We reaction to the front desk staff to write wrong, attitude is very bad, do not think that I didn't see him their partner to me reluctant to deal with things, I think he did not deal with to help us to communicate with the doctor's. Secondly, my cat needs some documents to fly next month. One of my cats does not need to shoot the cat plague vaccine. Without this vaccine, the doctor is not willing to sign his name. He also said that he was not willing to change the information, because he had spent a lot of time, then I would like to ask what is the use of this piece of waste paper? And we have to pay 30 dollars for a piece of useless white paper. We are guests, not not to pay, spend money to find the pain, in a word, I am not satisfied with the service this time, the quality of personnel need to be improved.<//Text>< pics>

I was going to this facility for years. At first they were so sweet and caring, but after a while my dog seemed to be extremely scared going in and leaving with her tail between her legs. Last week, my dog had extreme diarrhea and when I took her to the vet, they told me to give her low-fat diet and a probiotic. That was it. I took her to the Banfield in Colma the next day (they had early same day appointments) and they gave her anti diarrhea medication the first day they saw her. They followed up the next day and asked how she was doing.

Banfield hospital is overall a great place to take your fur babies. This specific location isn’t the best. Maybe they’re understaffed and too many pets to look out for.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>My dog oreo was taken to vet for foxtail removal,I had to drop her off in the morning because they didn't have appointment that day. Dr Rose call me in the afternoon saying that they didn't find anything and that if it was first time of oreo there?,which it wasn't. Somehow staff had created 2 charts with information of my husband and one with my information and they were trying to charge regular price when we had the wellness plan When I went and pick up my dog I was expecting to pick her up outside but the lady that help me ask me to come inside to pay, when It would have been easier to pay by the phone which I end up doing,I ask her to bring my dog out instead and told them to give me the indications by the phone. When I received my dog her paw was cover with a bandage and I wasn't able to see what they had done. The staff was trying to make appointment to bring oreo back in 2 days which I didn't agree doing it. After 2 days I open up the bandages myself and noticed it that they didn't do anything with her paw, her paw was swollen and full of pus and I knew this because in the past she had the same issue and was taken to somewhere else and resultes where different. We had to clean the wound and open up the wound to drain all the pus and Guess what we found " the foxtail" that Dr Rose couldn't find. My husband call the place to talk to the manager about what happened, he was told that manager was busy, he left all his information for a call back and until today we haven't received a call yet. Please please do not ever take your dog to this location. Waste of time, waste of money and very unprofessional people.< /review>< pictures>

I just wanna share my dog’s experience last Tuesday June 30’2020. Due the corona virus I agree to have an Appointment (a drop off appt) @9:30am (for 4 years old dog ) for his Comprehensive Exam which is usually not longer than 2 hrs . But this appointment took so long about 6 and half then they called me around 4pm for pick up. I feel like weird and worried and wondering why so late. Then when i came to hospital to pick up my dog I’ve noticed his left eye was so red and have a huge blood clot around the eyes and bruise on the top of his eye. Im really upset that day, mad, and very disappointed asking what happen to my dog? Then this rude staff lady answered: ask the doctor In charged, then i’ve told her i want to talk to the doctor. Sadly the doctor not came out and he just talk to me via phone while im outside of the hospital. He said the swollen eye of my dog is due of stress and trauma. Unbelievable i do understand most of pets get stress and traumatized when they go to the hospital and grooming salon but it happens all  the time but this one is different . When i saw my dog his really scared and hurt so bad, im a dog parent I know his action. Please help me to find out what is going on. As a dog parent I trusted them to take good care of my dog , please treat them like a human they have a feelings too. Hope you can help me in this matter. And please hired people who has a big heart for all pets.< /text>

<userid>111547330068351010489< /userid><Text>Dr. Lee at the Banfield location in Daly City saw my 15yr old Shih-Tzu, which was coming in for an appointment regarding his dental disease. After reviewing my dog, she recommended that I put him to SLEEP, meanwhile she was not even a dental surgeon and could not provide me with any information as to if he was in pain or suffering!! She proceeded to tell me that my dog was severely underweight, going senile and could not give a response regarding what was going on in his mouth even after asking her to check if he had a broken tooth several times. However, after consulting with another vet who IS a dental surgeon Dr. Huynh also at Banfield Daly City, he was great and recommended that I go though with the dental surgery. I took my dog to Ocean Ave Veterinarian Hospital in SF and they saved my dog and also told me he has at least another two years of life......Dr. Lee I hope you see this review and I hope that you LEARN compassion and STOP jumping to conclusion OR assumptions. Dr. Lee should really look at changing careers because you don't have what it takes to be a Good vet, you almost killed my dog. Had I not gotten a second and third opinion, I would have put a perfectly healthy family member to sleep!!!</Text><Rate>1</Rate><Date>1591662718537< /Date>< name>

When I go to pick up my dog and pay, there was some confusion with the account, eventhough I told them I was fine paying the full amount. They told me to have a seat to wait for the manager. The benches are about 5 ft from the front desk and I hear one woman say to the other that "there have been multiple calls and I don't want to get involved with that." I didn't even know what was happening. Ultimately it came down to misinformation. After 30 mins of them telling me my plan never included castration they finally actually looked it up and noticed that it had just switched. I still have no idea why no one told me that my care plus plan (or whatever it is called) had expired only 7 days earlier and it automatically updated to a lower plan that didn't cover castration until after he was already neutered.  We had tried calling a month ago to get in sooner and the woman on the phone said they were extremely busy and would call us back but never did.
**Also my dog HATES it there.</Text>< Pictures>

Have taken excellent care of all four of our dogs over the years, even providing thoughtful touches when we had to say goodbye.... Wish they could keep the same staff for a bit longer, so there was some consistency in who sees my dogs.< /text>

<review>The environment at this hospital is just amazing there customer service is above and beyond they treat my two pups just like I treat them as humans they're loving their kind for understanding I recommend this specific hospital to everybody you could not ask for anything better . They keep you at ease as you're waiting for your pup's with smiles and consoling conversating and checking on you and updating you on your puppies once again this is the best place in the world I have never met more nicer people that I have met here bless their souls. The secretaries Rock in the doctors are amazing best place I will keep regardless of where I move I will keep returning to the specific when Kudos you guys kudos</review><username>Kristina K</username><Time>1513881359515< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

< review>
We just bought a female yorkie.  Vet was very informative and reassuring.  We changed our mind about breeding her as we would rather have her around longer.  Did not know breeding them could subject them to breast cancer.  Was told the dog flu is contained to the East Bay and to hold off until it expands to give the flu shot.  Same thing with ticks...  we didn't get it with our prior dogs so he recommended holding off until we found one.  I am all about prevention but don't like too much medicine or vaccinations unless necessary.<//review>

This place is way too busy! The vets seem stressed out trying to keep up with demand. After setting an appointment you only get a few minutes to talk about issues with your pet. With the amount of volume this place handles I feel this may not be the best place for a thorough examination if your pet.< /text>

They didn't seem concerned for my cat when he had crystals in his bladder. Instead of treating him they told me to go to a vet hospital if it got worse. They offered no treatment and slapped me with a $1400 bill. Would recommend to stay away from this place.</Text>

You'd think a pet hospital near your home would make things easier for your pet and you, right? Wrong. I had a horrible experience at the Banfield Pet Hospital when my dog injured her leg. I was frantic at the time, not knowing what to do. Since I remembered there was a pet hospital near me, I went here. However, the treatment that my dog and I received here was horrible. The vet offered to amputate my dog's leg and was going to charge me $700. I knew there was another option, so I decided to reject that option. And since I opted out, the receptionist and vet were rude to me.</Text>

WOW! Called because I was at a different petsmart but I needed my prescription number since I didn't have my prescription card with me to buy my dog's food. It was 15 minutes before the hospital would close but somebody picked up the phone, took my information and put me on hold. After a couple of minutes on hold the call was drop so I called back and noticed that they had put the phone on night mode and my call wouldn't go through. I still had time to call a Banfield hospital in San Mateo where they closed at the same time after this horrible experience. Horrible service</Review>

(Translated by Google) This pet hospital is good. I like it very much. Because all the medical staff at this pet hospital are very caring about pets among any pet owners. The pet doctor also has great love to meet any different pets. The service attitude of other front desk waiters is also very good. Reassuring pet owners, pets are happy to get along with medical staff and receive a diagnosis. Not bad. Awesome

这宠物医院很好，我很喜欢。因为这宠物医院所有的医务人员对任何有宠物的主人中的宠物非常之有爱心。宠物医生也有非常好的爱心去见任何不同的宠物。其它台前服务员服务态度也很好。令宠物主人放心，宠物们也开心和医务人员们和好相处和开心接受的诊断。不错。棒棒哒👍< /review>

This review is specifically for Manon, although I'm sure the rest of the staff is also great. We called to schedule an in-person self-guided tour one morning with someone else (didn't catch their name) and Manon called a couple hours later to follow up. She was super friendly and professional and seemed genuinely interested in making sure she understood our needs and got us a perfect fit. On the day of, she got to know us a little better and then gave us a map of the property for the self-guided tour. She color-coded different spots, gave us clear directions to them, and told us to call if we got lost. The place seemed pretty cared for and we loved the security measures. We ended up choosing a place closer to work but were considering making a longer commute because of Manon. She provided the best customer service and we wish every housing complex had someone like her!<//Text>

I love our unit. When we moved in, it was absolutely spotless and they had even freshly painted everything so it felt pristine. The location is great- perfect distance from both freeway and beach and right next to Sprouts. The staff, though, is what makes this place really wonderful. The maintenance staff is always helpful and friendly. The front desk staff, particularly AJ, Nicole, and M, have been super helpful in addressing any issues I've encountered with the most professional and friendly manner.< /review>

<user_name>Caitlin Patla<//user_name><Text>I love Regency Palms. The property itself has a very home-like feel unlike newer and more luxurious properties that feel like a hotel. I really love the courtyards in the center of each little cluster of units. It's so refreshing to return home from a long day of work and see a pretty green courtyard with big trees and healthy grass.

I have lived at RP for 13 months and I have just renewed a 12 month lease. I love the staff - Nichole and AJ are both extremely helpful and prompt in responding to any concerns.

Maintenance staff is stellar also - I've had two issues within my 13 months, one being the doorbell needing to be fixed (did not ring inside the apartment) and the second being a bathroom light which needed to be replaced. Within 24 hours both issues were taken care of. This is during COVID too! No delays.

The location is great as well. I am close to everything I might need. Bella Terra is right down the road, plenty of gas stations, restaurants, and grocery stores within walking distance. We also get a nice ocean breeze year round 😎

I love Regency Palms. I'm glad I'm still able to live here.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1621026264160, 'text': "Hello and thanks so much for taking the time to write this review!

Great location. Rooms are large and the apartment has a cozy feel to it. Looking forward to using the pools in the summer. M was my leasing agent and extremely pleasant and helpful in making the process easy and painless! Love my new home.</text>

The leading consultant Ms. Glennon was very helpful, professional and all around wonderful. The regency palms apartments are run by a professional and efficient property managing company, that takes pride in creating a safe environment for their residents. They take parking and safety very seriously and constantly have security monitoring the place. It also comes with a pool, laundry site and parking spaces. Ms. Glennon made the leasing process very easy and simple so that me and my roommates could move in as soon as possible. She is very nice and open to everyone. I love it😊</Review>

If I could rate Regency Palms with more than 5 stars, I would. My husband and I moved in October 2019. We received nothing but warm welcomes and smiling faces from the ladies in the front office. Corinne and Kim are a huge reason why we love living here so much just because of their hospitality. Last month we decided it was time to upgrade to a bigger place (since we were in a 1 bed 1 bath). Long story short, we put down a deposit to another complex and eventually backed out because Corinne and Kim were able to find us something better (not even 50 feet from where we were living). So we ended up moving to a townhome here and we truly couldn’t be happier. If I need maintenance done, they always come through the same day. If I need literally anything, the front office management always finds an answer asap. Living here feels like a breath of fresh air to say the least - and we couldn’t be happier.<//Review>

<Review>Leasing staff were friendly,  informative,  and punctual. I was greeted warmly when I entered the office. Corinne scheduled my appointment. She was punctual for set time to tour. She informed of details about the amenities,
leasing guidelines,  and options for rentals.  She also followed up by calling me and asking about the tour and status on consideration.  I really like the option to apply online.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1579633955752, 'text': 'We are thrilled to read your positive feedback!

<review>I lived here for one year.  This was a few years ago.  The reason I give it two stars is because it wasn't great.. But it also wasn't a nightmare.  There were so many dogs.  And they constantly barked.  I had three dogs underneath me, two dogs next to me, and an annoying weiner-dog diagonally. Our carpet pulled up, so what Maintenance did was get a slice of brand new carpet and stitch it on. So the carpet was basically two tone.   There were dog droppings all over.  No air conditioning.  It was so hot.< /review><userid>103308033039219108396</userid>< rate>

From the moment my girlfriend and I stepped foot on this property we got that nice warm feeling that we found our next little home for us and our 2 puppies all thanks to Kimberly.  She greeted us with a warm smile and showed us a few different apartments until we found the one we liked.  Kimberly helped us every step of the way and even made the application process fun when it can be nerve racking for some people.  She is very knowledgeable about the apartments and answered every question/concern we had.  When inspecting the apartment with us, she was very diligent and wrote down every note/concern we had and addressed the situation right away.  This complex has nice green grass, trees and plants and everyone we have met so far has been really nice and welcoming!  The pet policy is amazing as it was something we worried about having 2 large dogs.  I would 100% recommend this place 10/10 times.<//Text>

<review>My experience with living at Regency Palms has been nothing short of excellent. The staff is always accommodating to any needs required, especially staff member Corinne, who consistently displays complete professionalism and care towards the residents. She has always projected kindness and friendliness unto myself and my family, as have the other staff.
Maintenance staff stays on top of the complex, inside and out. Grounds always look beautiful and pleasant to come home to.
Definitely a great place to live!</review>< pictures>

I still live here and I still love it. The townhomes with the private patio make me feel like I don’t even live in a complex. Everyone that visits comments on how quiet it is and how much they love my patio which has plenty of room for patio furniture as well as plants and gardening. The management is so helpful and quick to handle any concerns. If I could buy my place I would. The fact that it’s pet friendly is a huge plus as well. :)< /text>

<Review>I lived there on and off for 8 years. The current team is one of the best that they have ever had. We moved out recently and my son continues to miss it and talk about the memories he made there.

I moved here in Dec 2014. The staff was very friendly and helped me make my move easy. What I don't like is the parking situation. You only get 1 car port and 1 parking space outside which needs a permit so that means no guest parking. It's understandable I guess but what sucks is that at night there are so many car ports empty and parking spots are full so what the heck. Anyways, the other things I dislike is that there are so many dogs and children here. I can hear everything that goes on outside my window and it sucks. The kids are running around and screaming on weekends and the parents just let them. The laundry room is convenient though, never had a problem and always clean. Overall my apartment never had anything that had to be fixed and I would say its clean here. Would I renew my lease? No. Would I recommend anyone to live here? Sure maybe if they work mornings and weekends so they wont be woken up.<//review>

I lived here for over a year and a half. During my first lease, my apartment totally flooded during a severe rain storm, and they moved me to another apartment, but they only compensated me very minimum amounts despite the fact that I was out of my home for 2 1/2 days! Plus, when it rains, the entire front common area by the leasing office, floods so bad that the water comes past your ankles. I moved in on the 2nd of the month, when I was rained out of my apartment they did the new lease start date on the 9th of the month, (without my consent), and when I gave my move out notice for the 9th, they told me I had to make it for the 11th, (because they don't do move outs on the weekend, thus, making me pay an additional 2 days.) I gave them back their keys on Saturday, the 9th, but I had paid through the 11th of the month. I cleaned the apartment BEFORE I left, and I did not do any damage to the walls, but when I received my security deposit statement, they charged me for painting and cleaning, as well as a early lease termination fee, (never mind the fact that I had paid at the beginning of the month for the 1st-11th.) I am lividly angry with the management because I have NEVER been a problem tenant, and I even tried to roll with the punches when a lot of my personal property was severely damaged or destroyed when THEIR apartment flooded during the rains, and I was displaced for days. All they did was rip me off and act like it was their right and it was OKAY!!! Their apartments are outdated, (except for the few that they have recently updated since my 1st apartment flooded), and this complex is well overpriced! There are quite a few apartments in the Huntington Beach area that will accept your pets, including the apartment complex right next door to Regency Palms, I would seriously suggest you look to one of those, and skip Regency Palms, because the only REAL thing that they have going for them is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! But, nothing else!!! And, FYI, when it was time to renew the lease, even if I had signed a new 1 year contract, they wanted $200 more a month, and if I decided to go month to month, it would have been $500 more per month!!!! I have lived in several apartment complexes throughout Southern California, but I have NEVER had an apartment complex go up so high when it came time to renew a lease!!! My word to you on Regency Palms is, "Tenant Beware!"< /Text>

Moving in went great! Jem and Shawn were both helpful, the experience was quick and easy. I'm a returning tenant since I liked it here so much the first time. They worked with my schedule and the team communicated with each other well, showed me around and explained everything. A nice bonus is that this apartment came with a fridge so you don't have to worry about buying something big and expensive and bringing it in. It all went well, thank you! (:< /review>

< review>
Appliances out dated and only partially working. Spider webs and nests everywhere under eves and roof tiles. Security is either non existent or towing vehicles at will. Upon move out was harassed to stay and charged a ridiculous amount for repairs. Was there for three years never a missed payment and they still want more money after deposits. I guess when someone is a good tenant they take as much as they can. I highly recommended not moving into this complex. If I could give a no star rating I would.</review>

Parking is a problem, no consideration while we were moving and got our uhaul truck towed, a lot of hidden  fees that wasn't mentioned during our tour, no ramp for courtesy for the people moving for upstairs apartments and unhelpful staff< /Review>

Our team strives to deliver a seamless move in experience by providing new residents with all the necessary information prior to the lease start date. We discussed additional fees may apply when utilities are not connected as outlined in the leasing agreement. The fire lanes are designated for emergency vehicles and the mentioned tow was issued due to the uhaul obstructing this zone overnight. We regret any misunderstanding or inconvenience, and we welcome you to connect with the management team with any questions or to discuss further.

My fiance and I are new tenants, and I'm happy to report that everything has been amazing! The location is perfect. Jemma was extremely informative and thorough throughout the entire process. She and Corrine have done so much.

Our 2 bedroom apartment is awesome! We havnt had any issues thus far. It's super clean and everything looked brand new when we moved in. We're so thrilled about making Regency Palms our home!! 💜<//Review>

If you enjoy cockroach infestation that never gets taken care of properly and management giving exterminators and maintenance permission to go into your apartment without any notice or notification then you will love this place. They have more than once just gone into my apartment without asking or even telling me , I cant move out of here fast enough, if i could give 10 negative stars i would.< /Review>

The occasional bad neighbor is always something that happens when you are apartment living, but the RP team seems to have managed to keep that to a minimum.

They have a great Maint staff that does all they can to keep a very aging property, vibrant and alive with quick turnarounds on reported issues and pretty solid grounds keeping in general.  RP may not have all the most modern amenities in the units, but they are by no means falling apart or in bad repair.  I constantly see the staff here working to improve the property and maintain it while still offering a fairly reasonable (for a beach city in Southern California) rent rate.

The staff is friendly and go out of their way to know their residents, especially those who go out of their way to help build those relationships.  You cannot force people to be open and understanding, but the demeanor of the staff here, enables those who choose to have those connections with staff, are enabled to do so.

My wife an I have happily lived here for almost 6 years now, in several units, 1 and 2 bdrm, and have been very happy since day one, but never more than we are with the current staff!

No apartment complex is perfect and nowhere will ever have 100% satisfaction with all of our neighbors, there are just too many personalities in the world for that, but RP does a pretty good job of building a friendly and safe community for it's residents...with very few exceptions in our experience!

< Review>
this apartment was a in a good location for me. Close to the beach, work, stores. Other than that for $1520 a month to live in a place with out dated cabinets that look like they have been painted over to many times already. Hinges had been painted over, the door didn't close right. After i moved in most of the paint started to peal off that had just been rolled over. Floor in the kitchen was that old school tile and no matter how much you would clean it, it never looked clean. No vent over the stove. Every time i tried to cook something that created some smoke the fire alarm would go off. had to open pretty much all the window and the rear door to vent the apartment. When I  moved in I noticed all the plugs in the house were worn. I tried to plug in a fan and the plug would fall out. There a fire hazard waiting to happen. Good thing they changed them all for me except one. If you like spiders than this is the place for you. They are everywhere. I would wake up in the morning with bites on my arms. I would find them hiding in the carpet, bathroom. As for people living around me I didn't have to much trouble. The parking is limited so having a few friends over is out of the question. Unless they want to park across the street on by the auto parts store and walk. After moving out I was charged for cleaning and paint. So don't expect to get  your deposit back. Not to mention if I would have stayed my rent would have gone up by 100 dollars. all in all great location. To bad rent is to high for outdated apartment. I have lived in a equity apartment in Arizona and I have to say it was a way better experience than this.</Review>

<review>I do like the calm and greenery here.  Though the construction is more than 45 years old and has plenty of problems, the front office staff and maintenance staff are wonderful and go out of their way to make sure we are comfortable and all issues are addressed. Especially in recent times when they seem to be under-staffed and over worked!

My special thanks to Jessie, Ryan, Eric (maintenance) and Jemma (front office).

Though most service requests are attended to promptly, there are times when important tasks remain in the backseat.  Like the main pool repairs which was supposed to take a week from Apr 10, REMAINS closed till this date (May 8).  I'll update this post if it takes longer yet.

My sincere request:  PLEASE INCREASE YOUR STAFF.</review><Response>{'time': 1494358327974, 'text': "It's a pleasure to have you as a member of the Regency Palms community and know that our mission is to make this a place that you are proud to call home.

<time>1409159972267</time><Rating>2</Rating><text>We absolutely love our new apartment in the Regency Palms Apartment community. We had our reservations at first, concerned about living alongside so many others in this 310 unit complex. We were assured that we would be happy, but if for any reason we decided it wasn't going to workout for us, we were given a 30-day satisfaction period from our move in date to change to another available unit OR to move out, No Harm No Foul, should we decide. Well, needless to say, we are VERY happy and wish to stay for a very long time
.
This IS a dog friendly community, but we ourselves are NOT dog owners. Regardless, they are no bother, but instead a joy to watch...and play with when the opportunity arises. There are green belts all through the complex so whether it's to walk your dog or just for taking an evening stroll with your loved ones, the grounds here at the Regency Palms have beautiful , well-kept landscaping and big beautiful trees to offer shade on those hot summer days. There are Doggy Waste Stations strategically placed all through the complex to help keep the grassy areas as clean and sanitary as possible. I see the Orkin man here every week inspecting and treating all areas and issues that may cause a problem if gone unattended. Due to there diligent and professional work, this community is bug free. I haven't seen one critter in over 2-months.

The Leasing Office Staff, including their maintenance and cleaning crews, have been an absolute blast to deal with. I've had a service request or two that I needed assistance with. Once reported to the Leasing Team, our issues were quickly and efficiently dealt with keeping me a happy & content camper :) Their five (5) laundry room facilities are always clean and available. The washers are bigger and less expensive than the Laundromat across the street in the shopping center. Trust me, we've checked. And speaking of local shopping & recreation, the Regency Palms is located within walking distance from grocery stores, Home Depot and lots of other much needed services. Very convenient! It's a miles walk to the Library, Central Park, AND Goldenwest College, and not to forget the Westminster Mall.
I have made some good friends already and all the people who live here are very nice. One of my favorite things to do here on a hot day is to go lay out, get wet and socialize poolside, in any one of their 3-well maintained pools + Jacuzzi. When I'm out enjoying the pool area, It's just like being at a Palm Springs resort.

In closing, let me just say this.........."If you are looking for a great place to live and  haven't checked out The Regency Palms yet, What Are You Waiting For?" Call and set up an appointment for a tour by one of their fantastic Leasing Agents. I promise , You WON'T be let down! :)))</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<review>This place is ok. If rated just on experience it would be a 3 star. However, they will raise your rent by $180 or more every year you renew the lease. It's like pulling teeth getting maintenance to come out, you have to keep calling them over and over again ot bothering them to get someone to come out. Once you finally get them there, sometimes a week later than they said they'd be out... They'll take care of your issues. But a few days to a week late. I would move right now, but we can't afford it. And they know it.

Bottom line: Be prepared to pay nearly $200 more every time you renew your lease. This place sucks. Also, not enough parking spots for the Tennant's and you WILL have to park on the other side of the complex sometimes if you don't get the garage port. They will also tow any guests vehicles if they are not in your spot. Parking is a total nightmare here.</review>< Rating>

The staff at Regency Palms apartments at 6762 Warner Ave do an excellent job.  The leasing consultants do an excellent job and are very knowledgeable.  I can also say the same about the property manager.  The maintenance crew also does an excellent job.  When you call in for a repair, it is taken care of in a very timely manner.  Property mgr. Nicole Mesa.  Leasing consultants: Corine Kirby and Kim Powell.  Maint. Mgr. Jessie.  Maint. personal: Javier, Minoa.  Their are two others but don't know their names.  It dosn't matter, as I said, office staff and maint, do an excellent job.

Sincerely
Ron Burg

Great looking complex and it deserves special consideration for being pet friendly and customer service. We met Manon on a Saturday morning and after a brief interview, she recommended us multiple units that would fit our need. After this we took a tour of the establishment and after the tour she has been helping us day and night with any of our questions and updates. I was impressed on how organized and responsive she is, even on Sundays and sometimes on holidays "M" usually would reply within minutes, this helps alot because the website sometimes doesn't work but having "M" to give us feed back makes everything okay. Due to this excellent customer satisfaction we can't wait to move in here as soon as the unit we want opens up.</Review>

I give a negative -1 star if the rating allows it.  This is because Zum school bus does not take any responsibilities or ownership in making changes to school bus schedule so that kids are pickup and arrived on time for school.  Even after we have made multiple calls to voice our concerns to Zum.  The scripted answer has always been, "We will look into it" but we never heard back from Zum.  Meanwhile, we continued to observe that the Zum school bus has always been running behind scheduled pickup time ranging from 10 - 15 minutes.  As a result, kids on the school bus are late for school daily.  Zum knows the bus arrives late for school daily, but doesn't care to do anything about it.<//Text>

<Text>As a parent, I thought I could rely on a company that supposedly provide services for children to follow the law when it comes to transportation. My son is 7 years old and extremely small for his age (in the 5th percentile on the growth chart) and has been using them to ride to and from school for 2 months now. On 2 separate occasions now, the driver has shown up without a booster seat.
I complained after the first incidence and was assured that it would not happen again, but the first time that my son had been assigned a different driver, they showed up yet again without a booster seat.
How can you ask parents/guardians to trust your services when you are putting children's lives at risk?< /Text>< Pictures>

Horrible company, horrible staff, horrible app, horrible customer service. The child transportation idea is a great concept and 95% of the kids are courteous and respectful, but don’t expect more than $18 for a 3 mile ride that takes 29 minutes sitting in traffic. They don’t reimburse for gas so what you take home each week with taxes taken out is basically pocket change. If you actually get through to them on chat (they don’t answer the phone or text) you can negotiate for a higher price ($20-$25) but they give you attitude about it and they usually (90% of the time) give your ride to someone else. So then you’re stuck with no rides all day. You will NEVER make $32 an hour or anywhere close to that. PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR THAT GIMMICK IT’S NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text>

I never got booked with a driver. I requested reoccurring rides for my child TWO weeks before the needed date. I received an email saying a driver would be matched  at 4 pm the day prior to the requested ride.  On the day prior I did not get a notification at 4 PM. I reached out at 7 pm because no driver had been assigned, although I was assigned a code word.  Why are they assigning code words for the child if no driver is assigned? After a few hours I receive a text saying they are trying to find a driver.  I asked if a driver was guaranteed or if I should make alternate arrangements. I am still waiting for a response. This is poorly run and if a driver cannot be found please let us know. A simple "you need to make other plans" would have been helpful. Don't leave me hanging not knowing if my child will have a ride home from school. I cancelled all my requested rides with this poorly run company and tried Hop Skip Drive. They have been wonderful; extremely responsive!< /Text>

I have been a loyal customer for years. In the beginning, it was great. The app worked well. The customer service was amazing. Things have changed. They seem to have outsourced their customer service and the agents are unable to resolve my problems. The app is glitchy and doesn’t work well. The prices have gone up but the service is worse. They have double charged me for rides. The final straw is that they have not assigned a driver for my scheduled ride in just a few hours. Bye Zum, I’ll be finding a new service.</text>

We have been using Zum from day one and sometimes we use it twice a day. It’s the best service we have ever used. They are on time, and our daughter really likes that she can go to places when we can’t take her. We both have busy schedules at work. Their scheduling department is great and very accommodating even with last minute requests. Awesome service, awesome team!!< /Text>

Disclaimer:  I have not used this service, but was looking for one.
Every Parent has to read the Terms of service. You are handing out Safety of your kids in hands of someone else. In the end you are in situation of needing service for providing to your kids, so comprising the safety and security of your kids defeats the purpose of why you looked at Zum in first place.

Also note almost every service similar to Zum has same TOS, releasing them of all liabilities and responsibilities.</review>

I am a driver with Zum,  I have done about 5 trips with them so far....it is an excellent service for kids transportation. My only problem is when I signed up to be a driver for them. They tell you that you make $32 an hour; let me tell you they have not given me any trips over $17 ( it calculates to $17 for 2 hours of work) unless you do 7+ trips a day , you may make $90 -gas= $ May be $70
Just saying that they advertise very heavily $32 an hour, at the end, but you really don’t make that much money.
Communication with staff is not prompt. Application could be easier.<//Review>

A family friend told us about this service they have been using . With multiple kids (3), managing schedules is painful. Zum has helped us  manage our multiple schedules, easily.

I wish they could increase the speed of their app. Other than that, no complains. We highly recommend them.<//Review>

Zum requested that I upload a minute video describing my experience with children, I did so in my car PARKED at my parking spot at my home.
They accused me of recording the video while driving to disqualify  my application.  It was obvious my car was not moving my hands were in my lap. I have no need to work with or for a company that blatantly lies about an application.  I have a 25 year blemish free driving record. Typical Silicone Valley ran tech company that has no idea how to treat people.</Review>

The drivers are great and my daughter feels safe with them. The customer service is the worst every. I have sent chat messages, called and never get a reply. Urgent does mean they will get back with you. I would give the drivers 5 stars and customer service 0 stars.</Text>

I’ve been working for Zum for a week now, and It’s been great! If you need a side job and you have experience working with kids, that’s for you. The rides pay well. I’ve got rides from $16 to $33. If you need a side job, don’t hesitate, don’t believe the negative comments. For sure, nothing is perfect, except God. But you should give it a try!</text>

<review>Me as a driver, just get “URGENT DRIVER NEEDED’’ text message

Wich means I’m in my house, and they text me saying there’s this ride available you gotta be there in 5 minutes.
Sometimes the hour they send it’s even past meaning that even if I wanted I wouldn’t be able to make it, totally a mess!!

The app doesn’t work at all

I have no schedule at all

That’s all I get from them a simple URGENT text message , not knowing anything and how much I will be making everyday

Yes there’s rides that costs over $20 BUUUTTT...
As there’s no schedule for me, I might get lucky getting a ride but that’s all for the day JUST ONE RIDE PER DAY

Who can survive with less then $40 a day?

I just wish that they would have:

A app that works
A number that we can really talk with someone
A schedule with the rides for the week

Didn’t know that it would be like this

I wouldn’t have wasted my time getting my car inspected, doing a interview and going to a agency paying over $100 to get the trust certificate that they ask for, because without it you can’t be their driver!</review>< pictures>

I have heard horror stories from other parents of Zum drivers being late or not showing up, dropping off young children unsupervised, smoking while driving, and otherwise behaving unprofessionally. I encourage parents to carefully research Zum, monitor them closely, and debrief their children if they try using this service.< /Text>

So satisfied and happy with Zum for my kid. A collegue of mine, who was using it for her daughter, suggested it i tried to give it a shot and have not looked back. I highly recommend it for every working parent who finds it difficult to juggle work and commute for their kids. Great service!< /Review>

<Review>Update 8/29/18:  In addition to concerns I note below about Zum's operations, parents should be aware that several 5 star reviews here were posted by individuals who appear to be employed by Zum based on Linkedin profiles, including:  Matthew Meyer, Martin Veliz, and Pedro Silva. If Zum's employees are posting employees of the company without disclosing their affiliation/connection to the company, that is misleading and deceptive as well as a violation of Google's policy (conflict of interest).

Original review:  Unsafe, unreliable, poor customer service--my son's school has been using Zum for school transportation for several months and our experience has been very poor. On multiple occasions, drivers have taken unsafe (unlit, windy, narrow) routes in the dark, engaged in unsafe loading/unloading practices, and have left students behind.  Zum's management/founders have also been unresponsive, dismissive, and unprofessional in response to complaints and feedback.  I am aware of at least one other Bay Area school that has experienced similar issues.  I do not believe Zum is ready to take on the responsibilities and care that is needed when transporting young children.  Zum and similar companies like it need to be better regulated. Please beware of Zum's terms of service--which purport to disclaim liability for anything that might go wrong--e.g., accidents, injuries, death. Zum also does not warrant their background checks of drivers. These terms are completely inconsistent with Zum's  promises to provide parents with peace of mind.</Review>< response>

<review>I give a negative -1 star if the rating allows it.  This is because Zum school bus does not take any responsibilities or ownership in making changes to school bus schedule so that kids are pickup and arrived on time for school.  Even after we have made multiple calls to voice our concerns to Zum.  The scripted answer has always been, "We will look into it" but we never heard back from Zum.  Meanwhile, we continued to observe that the Zum school bus has always been running behind scheduled pickup time ranging from 10 - 15 minutes.  As a result, kids on the school bus are late for school daily.  Zum knows the bus arrives late for school daily, but doesn't care to do anything about it.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>The staff seem to be in Central America. I called multiple times speaking to different people and no one could help me. Also, left messages for a manager to call me back without success. Maybe they charge less because their staff is in a different country.

<Text>As a parent, I thought I could rely on a company that supposedly provide services for children to follow the law when it comes to transportation. My son is 7 years old and extremely small for his age (in the 5th percentile on the growth chart) and has been using them to ride to and from school for 2 months now. On 2 separate occasions now, the driver has shown up without a booster seat.
I complained after the first incidence and was assured that it would not happen again, but the first time that my son had been assigned a different driver, they showed up yet again without a booster seat.
How can you ask parents/guardians to trust your services when you are putting children's lives at risk?<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Horrible company, horrible staff, horrible app, horrible customer service. The child transportation idea is a great concept and 95% of the kids are courteous and respectful, but don’t expect more than $18 for a 3 mile ride that takes 29 minutes sitting in traffic. They don’t reimburse for gas so what you take home each week with taxes taken out is basically pocket change. If you actually get through to them on chat (they don’t answer the phone or text) you can negotiate for a higher price ($20-$25) but they give you attitude about it and they usually (90% of the time) give your ride to someone else. So then you’re stuck with no rides all day. You will NEVER make $32 an hour or anywhere close to that. PLEASE DO NOT FALL FOR THAT GIMMICK IT’S NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>< user>

I never got booked with a driver. I requested reoccurring rides for my child TWO weeks before the needed date. I received an email saying a driver would be matched  at 4 pm the day prior to the requested ride.  On the day prior I did not get a notification at 4 PM. I reached out at 7 pm because no driver had been assigned, although I was assigned a code word.  Why are they assigning code words for the child if no driver is assigned? After a few hours I receive a text saying they are trying to find a driver.  I asked if a driver was guaranteed or if I should make alternate arrangements. I am still waiting for a response. This is poorly run and if a driver cannot be found please let us know. A simple "you need to make other plans" would have been helpful. Don't leave me hanging not knowing if my child will have a ride home from school. I cancelled all my requested rides with this poorly run company and tried Hop Skip Drive. They have been wonderful; extremely responsive!</Text>

<review>I have been a loyal customer for years. In the beginning, it was great. The app worked well. The customer service was amazing. Things have changed. They seem to have outsourced their customer service and the agents are unable to resolve my problems. The app is glitchy and doesn’t work well. The prices have gone up but the service is worse. They have double charged me for rides. The final straw is that they have not assigned a driver for my scheduled ride in just a few hours. Bye Zum, I’ll be finding a new service.< /review>< pictures>

We have been using Zum from day one and sometimes we use it twice a day. It’s the best service we have ever used. They are on time, and our daughter really likes that she can go to places when we can’t take her. We both have busy schedules at work. Their scheduling department is great and very accommodating even with last minute requests. Awesome service, awesome team!!<//Review>

<review>Disclaimer:  I have not used this service, but was looking for one.
Every Parent has to read the Terms of service. You are handing out Safety of your kids in hands of someone else. In the end you are in situation of needing service for providing to your kids, so comprising the safety and security of your kids defeats the purpose of why you looked at Zum in first place.

Also note almost every service similar to Zum has same TOS, releasing them of all liabilities and responsibilities.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>I am a driver with Zum,  I have done about 5 trips with them so far....it is an excellent service for kids transportation. My only problem is when I signed up to be a driver for them. They tell you that you make $32 an hour; let me tell you they have not given me any trips over $17 ( it calculates to $17 for 2 hours of work) unless you do 7+ trips a day , you may make $90 -gas= $ May be $70
Just saying that they advertise very heavily $32 an hour, at the end, but you really don’t make that much money.
Communication with staff is not prompt. Application could be easier.< /text>< Resp>

A family friend told us about this service they have been using . With multiple kids (3), managing schedules is painful. Zum has helped us  manage our multiple schedules, easily.

I wish they could increase the speed of their app. Other than that, no complains. We highly recommend them.< /Text>

<Review>Zum requested that I upload a minute video describing my experience with children, I did so in my car PARKED at my parking spot at my home.
They accused me of recording the video while driving to disqualify  my application.  It was obvious my car was not moving my hands were in my lap. I have no need to work with or for a company that blatantly lies about an application.  I have a 25 year blemish free driving record. Typical Silicone Valley ran tech company that has no idea how to treat people.</Review>< Time>

The drivers are great and my daughter feels safe with them. The customer service is the worst every. I have sent chat messages, called and never get a reply. Urgent does mean they will get back with you. I would give the drivers 5 stars and customer service 0 stars.</Review>

<text>I’ve been working for Zum for a week now, and It’s been great! If you need a side job and you have experience working with kids, that’s for you. The rides pay well. I’ve got rides from $16 to $33. If you need a side job, don’t hesitate, don’t believe the negative comments. For sure, nothing is perfect, except God. But you should give it a try!<//text>< time>

Me as a driver, just get “URGENT DRIVER NEEDED’’ text message

Wich means I’m in my house, and they text me saying there’s this ride available you gotta be there in 5 minutes.
Sometimes the hour they send it’s even past meaning that even if I wanted I wouldn’t be able to make it, totally a mess!!

The app doesn’t work at all

I have no schedule at all

That’s all I get from them a simple URGENT text message , not knowing anything and how much I will be making everyday

Yes there’s rides that costs over $20 BUUUTTT...
As there’s no schedule for me, I might get lucky getting a ride but that’s all for the day JUST ONE RIDE PER DAY

Who can survive with less then $40 a day?

I just wish that they would have:

A app that works
A number that we can really talk with someone
A schedule with the rides for the week

Didn’t know that it would be like this

I wouldn’t have wasted my time getting my car inspected, doing a interview and going to a agency paying over $100 to get the trust certificate that they ask for, because without it you can’t be their driver!< /review>

I have heard horror stories from other parents of Zum drivers being late or not showing up, dropping off young children unsupervised, smoking while driving, and otherwise behaving unprofessionally. I encourage parents to carefully research Zum, monitor them closely, and debrief their children if they try using this service.< /Text>

<Review>Me as a driver, just get “URGENT DRIVER NEEDED’’ text message

Wich means I’m in my house, and they text me saying there’s this ride available you gotta be there in 5 minutes.
Sometimes the hour they send it’s even past meaning that even if I wanted I wouldn’t be able to make it, totally a mess!!

The app doesn’t work at all

I have no schedule at all

That’s all I get from them a simple URGENT text message , not knowing anything and how much I will be making everyday

Yes there’s rides that costs over $20 BUUUTTT...

So satisfied and happy with Zum for my kid. A collegue of mine, who was using it for her daughter, suggested it i tried to give it a shot and have not looked back. I highly recommend it for every working parent who finds it difficult to juggle work and commute for their kids. Great service!< /Review>

Just recently joined the engineering team. Zum's HQ office is an open, welcoming and friendly place to work and is expanding quickly. Located next to the water and weather is the best in the area. You will be working with smart and determined people coming from successful companies in the tech industry.</review>

We were skeptical at first , but after digging in , we found this service is built for busy families. I am happy with the safety measures they have in place and I have met their drivers who are incredible, professional and early like working with children.<//text>

< review>
Update 8/29/18:  In addition to concerns I note below about Zum's operations, parents should be aware that several 5 star reviews here were posted by individuals who appear to be employed by Zum based on Linkedin profiles, including:  Matthew Meyer, Martin Veliz, and Pedro Silva. If Zum's employees are posting employees of the company without disclosing their affiliation/connection to the company, that is misleading and deceptive as well as a violation of Google's policy (conflict of interest).

Original review:  Unsafe, unreliable, poor customer service--my son's school has been using Zum for school transportation for several months and our experience has been very poor. On multiple occasions, drivers have taken unsafe (unlit, windy, narrow) routes in the dark, engaged in unsafe loading/unloading practices, and have left students behind.  Zum's management/founders have also been unresponsive, dismissive, and unprofessional in response to complaints and feedback.  I am aware of at least one other Bay Area school that has experienced similar issues.  I do not believe Zum is ready to take on the responsibilities and care that is needed when transporting young children.  Zum and similar companies like it need to be better regulated. Please beware of Zum's terms of service--which purport to disclaim liability for anything that might go wrong--e.g., accidents, injuries, death. Zum also does not warrant their background checks of drivers. These terms are completely inconsistent with Zum's  promises to provide parents with peace of mind.< /review>

The best library for miles!  A great selection of DVDS, Books, Magazines, Newspapers and Audible Books.  You can place requests for books and dvds and look online and tell how many, if any people are in front of you so you know where you are in the queue.  Great access to language, independent movie, information, and a lot of other types of online resources.</Text>

Best in town starting from director to staff and just the city it's in...and the awesome programs it offers to all it's patrons by far the best. It's just an amazing building, that I, a facilities worker here at Rancho Mirage have the pleasure of taking care of.< /Review>

<name>Sandra Ellis</name><Time>1523463707728<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>There is everything to like and nothing to not like at this model library.  Weekly programs to attract seniors, many about local attractions, celebrities, writers, and always supported by very inquisitive audiences.  I only wish their audible books had more than just the latest mystery books.  Would love to have Gentleman in Moscow or Last Days of Night but not available.  They are as close to perfect as a library can be.  Perhaps in the future, we can have some tech labs for seniors such as 3-D printing, info about social media that our granchildren might be using and why — not that we want to indulge, just want to know what the kids of today are gravitating towards.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Great library and resources resources for the community. This Library has everything one could ask for: books, audio books, videos, separate kids section, art exhibit, community meeting space, auditorium, shaded parking, solar panels, private study rooms, work spaces,  coffee bar, bookstore, and to top everything off... an observatory with the latest telescope. Came here with my kids and they quickly disappeared to the kids reading area.</text>< Pictures>

<text>The building is most congenial to a learning and relaxed atmosphere. The staff are very helpful and understanding to some of us not as familiar with technology. Library has a very good selection of materials. Longer time for keeping matetial during summer hours, like the extra time!< /text></record>

It's a damn nice building and grounds to boot.< /review>

Review for Aspen Mills.  The Library has a small cafe, great sandwiches and nice area to relax.  They don't seem to advertise it, so it is usually quiet and easy to get a quick sandwich or salad.</Review>

Wifi is hit or miss and doesn't work on the patio (library is kept cold). At the entrance there's a large placard explaining the latest art exhibit. The small exhibit is behind it on the wall. Then there's another placard about a second exhibit by the same artist. But it's no where to be found. And the lady at the front desk didn't have a clue what I was talking about when I asked where it was. Yet, she wanted to give proverbial "I'm sorry". Good grief.</text>

No parking spaces available and cars blocking the front to let out passengers so the rest of us were at a standstill.
I was there to check out books and even donate books and DVDs.
If the library wants to function as an entertainment venvue, then obviously more parking or valet parking is required.
So many people were blocked in because of others parking at the front entrance..< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Time>

I would rather travel the extra distance to the rancho mirage library. This library is heavily stocked and just a way better library, from the friendly staff to the well designed building and infrastructure. Way more inviting and people friendly environment. Love bringing my kids to this library ...   Thanks to the city of rancho mirage, And the rancho mirage library.</review>< pics>

This place is now San Felipe Seafood in Escondido.  Food was really good, but the service was really bad....Got there when they opened and not very many people.    Everything was going great and we placed our order... 40min later my husband and niece got their order... I was told that they made me another plate because what I ordered was not available.  I asked the waitress why did she not tell me that earlier...all she said was I’m sorry... I did not take the plate, since it was not what I ordered.  At that time my husband ordered another michelada, it took her approximately 15min to bring it and that was because we had to ask for it again.   At that time,I did ask why it was taking so long... her respond was I’m trying my best... her best wasn’t good enough, when you bring me something I didn’t ordered.  I understand something was available, but I wasn’t told or given the option to order anything else.   Never picked up dirty dishes....after that she was just down right rude.< /review>

Came here to get some tacos with my boyfriend, mother & father in law. Waited 5 min to be told we just sit anywhere. Took 15 min to even notice us to ask for drinks. Once we placed the order mine was the only one to arrive about (20 min after ordering) all I got were carne asada fries but the rest of my family got tacos & they took 50 min! My father in law said let’s go I’m starving & so we went to pay the bill & the tacos were barely going to be served to them. They didn’t want them anymore we just wanted to leave. Sucks because they didn’t even seem sorry that they made us wait so long. Anyways call ahead for tacos if you rather wait for your food at home.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Craving some real tacos and I drove past Sr. Taquito!  It was busy.  I couldn’t resist giving them a try and so I turned around and pulled into their drive thru.  I ordered 3 chicken tacos.  They are TJ style.  Oh man they were delicious!!!  Packed with grilled diced chicken, onions, guacamole and cilantro.  I really needed a fork because they were so full, they exploded out of the tortillas.  They were a dollar each.  I will definitely be back!!<//review>< gmap_id>

Beware the waitress will try to rip you off here ! DO NOT use your CARD here. Don’t get me wrong The food is fantastic and the $1 tacos are well worth it they come with lemons and salsa on the side , but the waiters are ruining this place with there horrible service and over charging that I believe they pocket and keep for themselves. ( I’m a young 21 year old man they thought they could take advantage of cause they figured I wouldn’t complain.... but know I will create many more emails then the ones I already have and rate this place many ,many ,many ,times 1 star and will constantly leave comments about the horrible waitress at this place . until the waitress at this place start to ACT right and charge there costumers fairly ) The first time I went to this place I went there to check out the $1 dollar tacos to see if there any good . When I started to look through the menu I couldn’t  find the $1.00 tacos so I ask my waitress where there at and she tells me they charge $1.75 a taco plus tax , when I asked if they where the $1.00 tacos they where advertising she told me they where but $1.75 was the complete price plus tax . I’m sure the young waitress pocketed the extra money . The second time I went I got a older looking waitress in her late 20’s and I ordered the same thing the $1.00 tacos . When I got my bill I was so shocked she charged me exactly $1.00 a taco . So I ask the waitress if there’s someone type of special deal going on that day and she tell me “ know the tacos are exactly 1.00 every day including tax . So I go there a third time and make the mistakes of using my credit card and when I get my receipt back I check the price and I’m okay with it this time and happy they didn’t rip me off . That’s until I check my credit card transactions on my phone and see she over charged me $6 dollars the receipt said $25 but I got charged $31 dollars .<//Review>

The food was good, but cold, it took us 20 minutes to get service...the waitress was sweet,  they need to put waitress on their on station, and have a hostess,  just a recommendation.< /Review>

Eh. Very slow service for us and and wasn't busy at all.  Took a long time to get our food. And I order grilled fish tacos and had to settle for beer battered fried as there was no way I was sending it back. Not impressed. Probably won't visit again... Sorry Sr. Taquito...</Text>

DONT GO HERE COVID INFESTED I went to the restaurant/ dirty whole in the wall. I had the worst experience at this dirty place. All the tables were not wiped down even though we are in the middle of covid crisis, not only did the waitress ignore us for 30 mins and were treated with such disgusting attitudes all the way through the dirty place. WE WERE THERE FOR A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION and WE ENDED UP  testing POSITIVE FOR COVID AFTER GOING THERE> we didnt end up eating there and left because we knew the establish wasnt clean . DONT GO HERE COVID CONTRACTED AT THIS PLACE< /text>

Bad. Just bad. Warm oysters served over 2 little pieces of ice. Tacos have too much cheese. No fresh salsa. Indeed it takes forever to get the bill. Expensive for what you get. The seafood cocktails have more veggies than seafood, very thin mix and the shrimp is like precooked one from the supermarket. Nothing was fresh. Burnt beans and black avocados. Terrible experience.</review>

This place deserves 0 stars. A few years ago my husband took me here for Mothers Day and I had oysters & I got food poisoning. Fast forward to now- we decided to try it again and LORDDD was it terrible. We stood around for about 10 mins waiting for someone to acknowledge us to get a table, finally was told to "sit anywhere". All the tables were soo close together and filthy! After finding a decent table we then waited around for another 10-15 min before we left because no one came to take our order. NEVER AGAIN.< /text>

The food was delicious, tasteful and fresh. Judy was my server, which was always quick & attentive. This was my first time here, & I'll definitely be going back again.

I tried several different tacos, and hands down it was delicious. My server Judy was excellent & on point. There wasn't a want that can think of, because she made sure I was always taken care of.
I definitely recommend this place to try out. Take your time, there is never no rush here... except for the service that is given to you ☺.</Text>

The service is ok, with the exception of woman manager who came to our table and aggressively told us the table recently given to us was not for us and needed us to move quickly.  She said, " this table is reserved for someone else, I am the manager, I need you guys to move this table is taken". She did not approach us in a tact respectful way, we felt degraded , embarrassed and humiliated which is sad that this place assigns people to management who have no experience what's so ever.</review>

Visiting from Iowa and wanted some legit Mexican food and of course Margaritas.  We waited a few minutes initially for our drinks but the wait was well worth it!  Margaritas were great!  And the food was fresh and everything we hoped for.  Beautiful day on the patio- perfect.  Will come again if we’re ever in the area!< /review>

<text>I ordered 2 margaritas bill was $22 whiched seemed high to me they were ok margaritas with a normal sized glass, so I gave my waitress $40 and she never came back, I went in and asked where my change was and she looked flustered and proceeded to pull one of my $20 bills I handed her out of her pocket I then asked for a receipt and she couldn't come up with it I told her what I had and she made a new one the bill was smaller this time...so I let it be but check your receipts there! And make sure they know you want your change back cause if you don't say anything neither will they!< /text>< Pics>

The food is amazing and service is amazing! Unfortunately when they hand you the bill is it just a price, not itemized like it should be. I was more than happy to tip way over what is normally due, because of the great service. What I was unhappy about what the very negative face when I asked for an itemized bill.The whole mood changed, like I was commiting a crime. The bill wasn't even that bad, so why give me such a hard time because I asked to see what I was paying for? What really concerned me is the fact that there was a big fuss over it and alot of work for them to do to provide that list. As I mentioned before the food and service was great, but be wary of what they try to charge you.</Text>

Horrible service. I even added them to Google maps just to give them a bad rating. Ordered  food and was then ignored the entire time. My dr.pepper was served in a 20oz bottle with no refills. When I asked for water I got one glass for rest of my meal. The waitress never came by the table. I had to go and find someone for my bill. I'm no thief so I just wasnt going to just leave. Even though I really wanted to. I will never go there again.< /review>

I have been getting my ceviche from here since 2014 and the person who prepares it makes it delicious. Today I went to get an order and was horrible. This restaurant looks like they made changes and not sure if the same cooks are in the kitchen. My ceviche was not marinated, the shrimp was whole, It tasted like a shrimp cocktail instead of ceviche. I think the shrimp was boiled.  I am rating this a 3 only because my ceviche sucked.

The customer service is good.  Those ladies are very friendly.< /text>

Really like the food and has always been great service. Waited for our food my wife got hers carne fries looked horrible. My daughter was given her two tacos but they were for the people that walked in after us lady took them. After 10 more mins My wife went up to the bar asked where's the food. Waited 5 more mins saw a guy walk in with 2 kids order food 20 mins after us got his food. I grabbed my two daughters and left. Never will I go back sucks I thought I found a cool hole in the wall. I tip well our kids have good manners I don't make up drama just I wouldn't go there.< /text>

(Translated by Google) A disgusting taqueria I went today the past beans no longer served the shrimp of the shrimp cocktail without a joke they tasted very bad the breaded shrimp great wacala I still told the waitress and she just laughed the vdd we will never go to eat there, they paid their bill just because we did not want the customers of the other tables to notice, terrible food not recommended

(Original)
Un asco de taqueria fui el día de hoy los frijoles pasados ya no servían los camarones del cóctel de camarón sin chiste sabían bien malos los camarones empanizados gracientos wacala todavía le dije a ala mesera y solo se rió la vdd nunca más iremos a comer hay , se les pago su cuenta nadamas porque no quisimos que los clientes de las otras mesas se dieran cuenta , pésima comida no recomendado<//text>

(Translated by Google) When we arrived they didn't offer us a table, they just stared at us. The place wasn't crowded for them to do that to us. The food took an hour and a half to arrive. We ordered cocktails and they weren't given them on time. Honestly, I didn't like the service at all.

(Original)
Cuando llegamos no nos ofrecieron mesa, no más se nos quedaron viendo. El lugar no estaba lleno para que nos hicieran eso. La comida tardó una hora y media para llegar. Pedimos cócteles y no los dieron al tiempo. Honesta mente el servicio no me gusto para nada.< /text>

I like the fresh produce at Smart & Final. The meat is fresh and every week various items in the store are on sale. If you buy in bulk this store on Bayshore blvd is the place to shop. They also have delivery service.< /text>

<text>Good prices especially on club size items. Good variety. Good meats. Cater to a low income. If looking for center cuts or specialty items this is not the place for you. I do not drink,but have a good selection of beer and alcohol.<//text>< response>

<Text>Everything is cheap but all of their produce is very moldy.tried to pick out the best produce but it was far worse then I thought. The garlic was all sprouting and couldn't be seen until opened. Their ginger was molded to the core where as you could normally just cut the tips and be fine. Bad place to shop produce. Other things maybe</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

An item that normally costs $10 was now $20. Cashier tried to say it was from "sugar tax" which is one cent per ounce however the total ounces of the item was 76 ounces. Simple math tells you that isn't correct. He refused to even consider any other reason..<//Review>

<text>It's like a small Costco without the membership. Cheap, decent quality, excellent for catering stuff and day to day shopping. Not my favorite place for tomatoes and other high end produce, but everything is great!</text></record></dataset><record>

If you like candy if you like sweets if you like me or whatever you like I really suggest you go to Smart & Final and they have both products and if you know how to store it right it'll last a while and if you need any other information about it just head to the store on Bayshore in San Francisco California if so have a great day I love this store I was just there about an hour ago going back tomorrow I basically live in that store I have a nice night and with all God's love I love you guys too goodnight< /Review>

This store needs more shopping carts. Found only 5 in the whole store. BYO cart to this store if you have a lot to purchase at one time. I could not do the shopping I needed to do for my business. They lost out on a BIG sale.<//Text>

Good place to shop goods, clean as well, could find almost everything that I was looking for, only the check out cashiers were kind of short of people. Gotta wait at least 20 minutes to be helped out.< /Text>

I got fired for stolen  product .. me knowing that it was my supervisor ...They never did a real investigation .they fired me the same day, because I was the last the last  to unload trailer but reported every action to supervisor,but Benjamin acted like was lying In  conference room during my termination  . Very poor management ... don’t recommend no one to apply here .they just take a   Advantage  of you . They all take  vantage of Halliburton . Lesson for me is nothing because,Video footage and the truth doesn’t matter to Haliburton..thanks for the journey and the training you guys provided.<//Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I was an employee of this company for 3 weeks and I had a bad experience with physical abuse by a black employee and I was harassed by supervisors and by several employees of that company since it does not have enough work team in the Area of Sanitation and apart require the workers to work long hours of work of up to 15 mandatory hours a day because if they work they dismiss all temporary employees all under cover of the plant manager named Rolando this company will be taken to the labor courts of the state of California by a server

This place is a slice of heaven in the middle of Hollywood! This well constructed oasis is sure to improve the walk-ability of the area.
It's more of a 'reflective space' and DEFINITELY NOT A DOG PARK-ish... they are welcome but they must be kept ON LEASH and CLEANED UP AFTER.
It's a  great space for kids, toddlers, grandparents and foreign nannies that want to ramble incessantly on Boost Mobile while they ignore your child.😕
My family is greatful the new neighborhood get-a-way😆.
We are also grateful for the area representatives, residents, city workers and elephant activists that made it all happen 💃💃💃<//Text>

This IS NOT an off leash dog park! It is a park that happens to allow dogs in it. Please STOP letting your dogs off leash here. They lock the gate open every day on purpose to discourage you from doing it, along with the sign that is right in your face when you first walk in specifically outlining that dogs need to be on leashes.</text>

Now that you have complained and they open all the gates even to Franklin Ave. The park is ALWAYS empty. At least before the people and dogs could enjoy it. Now that you have ruined it for the dogs at least go there and use the park. Now it just sits empty and no one is ever there.<//text><user>104887832175127973865<//user><username>Kim Rudy</username>< response>

Never crowded so far since it opened but it is so appealing...don't know how long it will last.
I have only been therd duing evening or early hours. It is closed 30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes before sunrise. Also has a small amphitheatre. Great use of space!</text>< date>

McFadden -Dale carries those hard to find , industrial strength tools snd hardware that the big box carriers won't carry. Pricing is competitive and well worth the visit. Staff is knowledgeable and eager to help.< /Text>

<Time>1597783994254< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I have been shopping at McFadden-Dale hardware for over 30 years... This makes me an old man. Regardless, I have always gotten the highest quality , American-made hardware and fasteners along with friendly faces and employees who are willing to help you, instead of hiding from you like they do at the big outlet. if I have to choose between home Depot and McFadden-Dale in Santa Ana I'm going to pick McFadden-Dale every single time--even if it cost me a little bit more because the people know what they're talking about, they help you, and you get what you need. Two thumbs up, five stars, and a happy face.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>When I called them today based on the good reviews online, the person who answered the call not only couldn't listen carefully, but also kept on making me repeat my question. He seemed to know nothing about hardware. When I finally told him that I would repeat it one more time, he hung up on me. How rude? (If you ever call them, get the name of the person first. Employees of a good companies usually have their employees identify themselves first when they answer the call, but not this company. Their employees hide behind the scene, and don't want to do a good job thinking that nobody knows anyhow.)

He probably thinks that they have already earned good reviews online that no one has to care about their customer services any more. Not so, as such a behavior must be disclosed. If they are truly good, then be good all the times, from inside out, to all customers, but not just good to some people sometimes until receiving good reviews from them, and then just forget about it totally. They have to be truly and consistently good, as a way of properly serving the public, at all times. I don't trust these reviews any more.

It's good enough enough that I still gave it one star (as otherwise this wouldn't be posted) when they really deserve no star at all based on my experience.< /text><Rate>1</Rate>< user_id>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED!
I would NEVER, EVER recommend this place for ANYTHING! Grainger is literally across the street. I ALWAYS try to support small business efforts and growth within my community HOWEVER, I can NOT support McFadden Dale. They treated me and even the person next to me in line like garbage.</text>

Let's make hardware stores great again! I have been going to Mcfadden-Dale since I moved to Irvine 36 years ago.  Not only do they stock everything, the product quality is excellent.  Don't waste your time and gas going to the big box stores who basically sell high-profit margin junk.< /Review>

This is a great shop. Has everything an engineer or a mechanic needs. Why go to granger and order in a catalog when you can actually go see and touch the stuff. Fair priced and friendly. Locally owned.</Text>

<text>So happy to have them here! The lines are super long but the employees are working hard and don’t miss a beat. My only concern is that there are some staff and trainers handling food without face mask. Also an employee came straight in and used her reusable cup and filled it up that was concerning.< /text>< user>

<Review>Today we visited and had a wonderful lunch with my family. Food is delicious and cashiers are attentive.  We would like to compliment a young lady named Amanda who is courteous in the dinning room with a beautiful personality.  I really appreciate the high standards of employees here at this New Victorville location! Welcome to our High Desert.  We'll be back for sure.💐<//Review><name>Valerie Becklund<//name><gmap_id>0x80c3679f6d502751:0xf59b7cc0062000f< /gmap_id><date>1626751346095<//date><pics>None<//pics></record>

I understand that 90% of this staff here is in training and this young man had a person working on teaching him the ropes. I would love to acknowledge the hard work they are all putting in and thank them for having to deal with all the anger that comes with long lines on a grand opening. Thank you Dustin and the rest of the staff. You guys rock!!!!< /Review>< Pics>

I went to the New Chick-fil-A a day after the opening because I wanted to avoid the high traffic. I skipped the drive thru and went inside to get my meal. It took me from parking to walking out with food in hand about 20-25mins.

I got the:
#2 deluxe meal with lemonade, 12ct nuggets, Peach Milkshake (~$22 dollars)

I used the restaurant WiFi to help use my time there.

Place was packed!

I will return.

Certainly this restaurant will serve the local community (Victorville, Apple Valley, Hesperia, Adelanto, Barstow, Oak Hills, etc) very well!

Edit: some other reviews about the long line, I have been in the High Desert since 2016 and have waited for a Chick-fil-A for 5 years now and we got one.< /review>

<Text>Finally got my CFA fix, after waiting almost a week after grand opening!
Pros = A+ for how smooth and fast it went! Got in line at 1140, on mariposa past steer n stein. Got my food by 1215.
Cons = no add on after ordering. Chicken strips were NOT fresh! Probably been sitting there a few hours and kept warm. No mobile ordering. Traffic in the area just got worse 😫</Text>< rating>

I will gladly accept long wait times for long lines .. but to wait over an hour in a line that was maybe 40 vehicles deep is pushing it. Eapecially when the line would go 5 minutes without even moving. There Is no hustle at this location. I got my screaming toddler a small shake to thank her for her patience... no straw. Normally not even a big deal but it was just the cherry on top to make this trip go from bad to worse.<//text>

<Review>You need to get your place on the chik fil A app so you can order ahead, pay ahead and just pick it up. The lines would go A Lot quicker!!! And you'd make more money. The one down the hill does great and is VERY efficient with that. Not being able to call is is not good. I haven't even been there yet, because I'm not willing to not only war goad (which is expensive today, but you're also polluting the air, letting your cat sit there idling) so it's too expensive to just sit there and then add the cost of the food. Come on, we aren't rich here.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80c3679f6d502751:0xf59b7cc0062000f<//gmapID><rate>1</rate>< name>

Probably my first ever negative experience with Chick Fil A. I feel that the employee who took our order in the drive-thru was rushing us and could’ve smiled more. I ordered the wraps and they forgot the ranch that comes with it so it was hard to eat because it was really dry. Also ordered the 12 piece chicken nuggets but we got 8 pieces and 4 smaller pieces that were chunks of the breading they use.</text>

<review>I would sooner drive down the hill and enjoy a CFA sandwhich knowing that I don't have to wait in an extremely long line for a ridiculous amount of time to enjoy the food. My sandwhich and my gas should not add up to the same price. When y'all adjust yourselves and get integrated with your app so I can order ahead and go pick up, I will gladly give you my business but until then, hard pass from me.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Looks like the staff can't handle it or ain't trained right. Took me an hour+ to get my food,, even waited like 15 min after the drive thru line ends because they ask you to park and wait for your food. Hoping this changes soon bc I love chic-fil-a.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I wish I could give them more stars but I can’t. The woman who took our order was rude. Then they had us park and came to the window asking if we were Jamie in English then asked in Spanish. Obviously we know what it is in English and Spanish. If we are telling you out name is Joe why would you ask us again in a different language. The macaroni and cheese tasted weird. I ordered a peach shake they gave me Oreo. They are just so unorganized there. Having people pull up and park makes it worse. Do what Rancho Cucamonga does to get everything right and in order. Keep people in the line just get your stuff together. Never been to a chick fil a where people were rude either. They’re always so nice. I’d rather drive to Rancho Cucamonga to get it and that’s what I’ll continue to do.</review>< Pics>

<Review>Finally!!!  I've been emailing Chik-Fil-A corporate since 2014 to get them to put a restaurant here in the HD.  I went on day # 2.  Through the drive thru.  Only took an hour.  Food was delicious of course.  No one cooks chicken breast better than Chik-Fil-A!  Now usually I only get to enjoy Chik-Fil-A twice a year so I'm scared to see what happens now that it's here in the HD!

Thank you Chik-Fil-A for finally bringing your wholesome goodness to the Victor Valley!!!</Review>< Pictures>

I was going to wait until the cooks had more experience and the employees had the routine down. My husband, nephew and I went on their first Monday open. We ordered inside and from being in line by the door until the time we received our food was only 15 minutes. Also, the food was so good just like it always is at the Rancho Cucamonga location. I'm so excited we finally have one. However, I do wish it was in Hesperia lol just like the sign said that was hanging on the fence by the Burger King at Main and the 15 freeway on April Fool's day. The employees are working so hard and doing such a great job!. Please people, be patient. GOD bless.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c3679f6d502751:0xf59b7cc0062000f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Horrible grand opening!! Waited in line for 3hrs. At the beginning I new there would be a line and waited patiently until I got in the actually drive thru and seen worker's just standing and talking? Like really the line is all the way to Scandia and your just standing around dancing and talking? Should of trained better and prepared the grand opening better.</text>

The entire process from getting into the lot, finding parking space, and ordering were a complete disappointment. We found a table and tried to eat but the noise level and total confusion made it impossible, and extremely unpleasant. This was my first and likely last visit.< /Review>

<Text>Matt from AC Plus Heating and Air was friendly and professional. I had my old condenser unit moved from the back to the side of the house. The two technicians that performed the work (one of them named Miguel) worked while it was raining and completed the work in a timely manner. My in-laws and I have been using AC Plus for all our HVAC needs since 2007 and they always take good care of us. A family business indeed.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

I called, got a same day appointment, and can't say enough about Sean H. who serviced our furnace. He was prompt, professional, informative, and so thorough.

<rating>5<//rating><review>As a retired system engineer, I spent a week coming up to speed on HVAC systems. I also spent 2 weeks getting 9 bids, which is over kill for most people; but the installer is the most important part of having a new system installed.  I read 100s of reviews many of which were from people who had no clue if their system was installed correctly, only that it looked nice and the installers were courteous. If the units are installed wrong, it could be years before you might find out that they were installed wrong.  So, when Shawn came out, I asked many detailed questions, such as, vapor/suction line size, flushing procedure for removing the R22 to replace with R410, how they keep the inside of the copper lines clean when cutting them, the evacuation procedure, etc.  Shawn not only had knowledgeable answers, but loved talking about it. He described in detail what they would do on the installation. Additionally, I needed an extension plenum to handle all my ducts and 90 degrees return plenum to relief the bend in my return air.  He also wrote down in detail what would be done, including all the addition materials that would be required to compete the job. I said that I wanted the part numbers of the AC unit, the furnace, and the evaporator coil on the quote; many bids came back with nomenclature, but no actual part numbers. I guess you are supposed to just trust them.  I told him I would be checking the serial numbers of the units to ensure they were manufactured recently. I’m a trust but verify type of guy. I know I can be a problem for some contactors, but Shawn didn’t mine.  He was happy to provide the stuff that I asked for. Shawn spent 30 minutes in my driveway calling part manufactures for available material and finishing the bid. He provided what I thought was a fair price with no sales pressure.
On the day of installation, Eric and 3 other installers showed up on time and went right to work. They were all polite and very respectful of my property. Again, they had no problem with me “overseeing the work”. We often talked as they worked and I had a chance to find out how knowable the installers were too.  I am confident they installed my equipment correctly and it will last for many years. After the installation was competed, Shawn followed up with a visual quality inspection of the work to make sure that I was satisfied. I would highly recommend   AC Plus.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1616520507357, 'text': 'Thank you for your five-star review, Larry.

The AC Plus team have done several jobs for us. They have serviced our AC units, they have swapped one of our AC units, swapped motors out, they have done general maintenance, diagnosed and repaired our heating system. They are our AC and heating guys, and we would not bother even trying another company because the AC Plus team is just that great.< /Review><date>1613411687114< /date>< Response>

<Review>Very impressed with Matt and Eric and his crew who installed a new furnace. Our old furnace died, of course when it was 26 degrees overnight, but Matt ensured we had a new one in a couple of days where other companies were estimating 2 weeks. All of the guys were  very professional, friendly, and did a great job of cleaning up. Highly recommend.

The crew came by at 9 a.m. and were gone by 1:30 p.m. They installed a new heating/AC unit and replaced all the ducts and vents. They were professional, worked quickly, wore masks (COVID sage), and were very courteous. Definitely recommend them.< /text>

<Review>Matt figured out the issue with our heater in less then 5 minutes! We’ve been  having issues with our heater  for 4 years and a different company we used to use each time was never able to figure it out! Matt knows exactly what he’s doing! He goes over details and gives honest information! Great customer service! Very pleased and glad we decided to give this company a call< /Review>< Pics>

Our air stopped working during the worse heat wave in a long time.  We called on Monday and AC Plus were able to send Sean out on Wednesday.  He was INCREDIBLE!!!  Knowledgeable, professional and kind.   He replenished our Freon and advised us to start thinking about replacing our almost 15 year old unit.  Gave us information about the best unit for our home and the price.  He also showed me how to properly use our thermostat and spotted one of our vents that was installed backward.  Changed our filter and was just so thorough.  Thank goodness I found them on the internet. It’s so hard to know who to trust sometimes when you randomly pick a repair company. We were blessed and now have a nice cool home.<//review>

She listens to our needs and makes sure we have the soonest appointment available. That makes a good first impression. Sean is the repairman who has been to our home a couple of times. He arrives within the scheduled time window and he's even called to see if we're available to come a bit early!! That helped when the AC wouldn't work. Sean does a great job. He is knowledgeable and thorough with his work and explains what he is doing, what he suspects might be wrong, checks everything, makes suggestions and completes repairs in a timely manner. Price quotes are always fair and reasonable. We won't use any other company but AC Plus Heating & Air. Honest and top notch professionalism.

<Review>AC Plus Heating and Air installed a new hvac on a house in Hesperia for me.  They did a great job.  I called several companies for quotes and they gave me the best quote (January special).

Jonathan and Omar were very courteous and professional. they explained what the problem could be and heard the chirping sound coming out of the vent. the problem was the angle of the vent slats rubbing and causing a vibration thereby causing the chirping sound. if i would have known that, i could have fixed it myself. anyway, we are very satisfied and look forward to having either Jonathan or Omar servicing our needs in the future.< /review>

Very professional and gets their job done. A guy named Luis (I believe that's his name) and another guy came to clean our air vents. They did a thorough job and answered any questions we had. We had a problem with our heating system so they were kind enough to answer any questions and provide an estimate on the spot. They were very kind as well. 10/10 recommend to anyone for all the services.< /text>

From Sean coming to quote our job (replacing 2 rooftop units) to his follow up before and after the job, everything went better than could be expected.

<rate>5<//rate><text>AC Plus Heating & Air was recommended to us from a good friend who herself had only very positive experiences with this company.  Our A/C went out suddenly on a very hot day in July, and calls to our usual repair company were only going to voicemail. But AC Plus had a very pleasant representative answering the office phones and connecting us to dispatch immediately.  Our service tech was able to move the next day's appointment to same-day service, which we appreciated beyond words. Anthony identified and fixed the problem and we think the charges are reasonable and we appreciate the convenience, priority service, and savings of purchasing the offered optional annual service plan for our two roof-top heat/air units that are vital to our daily life.</text><resp>{'time': 1595967586957, 'text': "Hi Lynne, we're pleased to hear that our staff could help to make your experience such a positive one.

Sean came out and serviced my central unit. The price was fair for maintenance portion and he informed me that my breaker was concerning (which I had it replaced). It did make a dent in my pocket but not as big as if the breaker went out and damaged the compressor with it. Sean was very professional and respectful .
I would recommended this place to anyone who is in some serious need for ac work and or just need some maintenance ( yes like your car your ac unit needs servicing too)
Absolutely pleasant.<//Text>

< review>
I'm about 4 years late on this review, but I just have to come on here and give a review while I'm sitting here comfortably in my warm house on a chilly day.

It was four years ago when our heater went out, and if memory serves me right, it was either the weekend before or the weekend of Thanksgiving. Anyway, I didn't expect anyone to help us promptly and at a reasonable price because of how busy the holidays are. These guys not only helped us right away, but they gave us a great price, too! We live in an older home (built in the 60's) so it was time to have everything replaced--the upgrade was not only nice, but also made us feel much safer having a newer unit after all those years.

To this day, my family and I are so grateful that these guys treated us as a priority, and not a customer that they had to "squeeze in" their busy schedules. Living in an older home, there are many problems we face in maintaining our home, but because of AC Plus, our heating system is something we never worry about anymore! Thank you Matt and everyone who helped us--we recommend you to everyone!< /review>

I called in the morning because my heater stopped working. I have a 93 yr old mom who gets cold very easy. The lady who answered the call I did not get her name. She was very professional and made an appointment for that afternoon. She seemed to understand and have compaasion of a 93 yr old being in the house when it is cold. Sean came out that afternoon to take a look at the unit. Sean was also very professional and a nice guy. He found the problem and was very efficient in making sure he got me a price which  and even replaced my filters for me on the spot before work would be done. This company is busy i am sure but them knowing that i have a 93 year old in the house they ensured me someone would be iut to take care of the problem in the next few days. I feel like this company really cares about their customers and are very knowledgeable in there work. Thanks for that.< /text>

AC Plus did an OUTSTANDING job at my residence! Their employee Donald showed up promptly, was professional and very knowledgeable in tackling the problem at its source! AC Plus will be on my “speed dial” from here on out! I also know the supervisors of AC Plus also go out on service calls to take care of all their customers/clients.<//text>

AC plus, especially Sean Hawkinson, are very customer driven.  Unfortunately I have not been able to move forward with the job yet due to some unexpected events on my side.  Even when I had to cancel a job I approved I was shown genuine concern and professionalism.  I never felt an ounce of pressure and never had a sales pitch forced on me.  Can't recommend this team enough, really feel that they care for the customer and not just the bottom line.<//Review>

I can't say enough about how delighted we are with the service received from AC Plus. Not only did they work us into their ridiculously busy schedule, their tech (Matt P.) was polite, courteous and professional. He quickly diagnosed the issue and made immediate repairs at a very fair price. This company has earned my loyalty and all future business for HVAC needs.</review>

This was my second time working with AC Plus and it’s been great. I requested Tony to help diagnose the issue with my Air Conditioner since he rocked the Heater issue last year and convinced me to upgrade to the Nest system which was worth every penny. He’s really fast to diagnose and thorough as well. Not to mention he’s has an all around great personality. Great service and excellent customer service!<//Review>

I am incredibly impressed with AC Heating &Air. My AC unit stopped working last night so I called them fist thing this morning. They literally sent a technician two hours later and he immediately identified the problem, changed out the part that had broken, and changed my air filters for me.  Phenomenal customer service from the sweet lady I spoke to this morning to the knowledgeable technician who fixed my problem. I highly recommend AC Plus Heating & Air!!</Text>

Tony Oliver arrived early (after calling ahead). He's very professional and courteous. Showed us what he was doing and pointed out some issues to be taken care of in the relatively near future due to the age of our unit. We highly recommend AC Plus for all heating and air conditioning needs. They are also the local service company recommended by our units (Carrier) company.<//Text>

I’m so pleased with this company, I called a few and they where up to two weeks out before someone can get to us, but I called and spoke to a very polite lady that was more than happy to get someone out here the next day. The technician that came out Tony Oliver was very polite, honest, understanding and everything he offered was reasonable. He took care of my AC PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY. Thank you AC PLUS for great customer service and I will be spreading the news to everyone that will listen.< /Review>

<username>Lehman Moses< /username><Text>AC Plus was the best service I have ever gotten from any AC service company. The technician arrived early, they call ahead of course. My issue was worn control components on two condenser units. I thought I might have to replace these units, but instead he replaced what was needed, checked the performance, and saved me money. The positive reviews are why I took a chance on calling them. So I wrote this review to add my satisfaction to the list.< /Text>< userid>

I have called AC Plus Heating & Air for two of my rental properties in the High Desert. They are quick to schedule, the tech calls before coming out to let you know he's on the way and they show up on time. I scheduled a tune up for one of my properties and Sean came out and did a thorough evaluation of the system and was honest enough to tell me that if he did the tune up on my 30+ year old system, it was probably going to cause a system failure. He scoped the unit with a camera and explained everything he was seeing, and gave me a fair bid on a replacement system. We're definitely considering using AC Plus Heating & Air for the replacement, when the time comes. They also handled a minor repair on the other property (blown fuse) quickly and for a reasonable price.< /Text>

<review>Called first thing this morning because our A.C. stopped working last night. I was worried that they would not be able to come trouble shoot it until tomorrow, but the gentlemen I spoke to said they would squeeze me in. After being transferred to a young lady, she assured me that someone would be at my house between 9 and 11. At 9:05 my phone rang, and my technician informed me he would be he would arrive in 25 minutes, and he was true to his word. As soon as he arrived he made his way into the attic and within 10 minutes he traced the problem down to a bad circuit board. Kudos to the company for having stock on hand in their trucks rather than waiting to order or going back to the shop to get one. All in all after about 30 minutes we were back in business and the family was happy. I cant thank this great business enough. Our technician made this a seamless and wonderful experience. This will be my go to company for any heating and cooling issues moving forward. Keep up the great work, and thank you again.< /review><response>{'time': 1595867131768, 'text': "We couldn't have written ourselves a better review, Charles!

Matt came and tried to fix it, but it tripped again later that night. So he said we would need a new unit. In a couple more days, Matt came back to replace the unit. Got it up and running. Tripped again! Matt said it was probably the breaker was weak (perhaps this would have been the first thing to check?), so he brought one over to replace the old one and get us up and running again. However, my husband, a former electrician, was concerned because Matt put in a 40 amp breaker with old wiring which only supported a 30 amp breaker. So, we ended up replacing the 30 amp breaker ourselves, even though the new unit clearly stated it required a 40 amp breaker. We repeatedly called Matt and the office to come and finish the job. My calls went unanswered or were put off for several days. All we wanted was for them to finish the job-properly wire the unit and put in the correct breaker. This took almost another week. FINALLY Donald and Louis showed up and quickly and expertly completed the job that should have been done in the beginning. For THEM we give 5 stars.< /text>< time>

< Review>
I called AC Plus inquiring about a duct cleaning for a rental unit that was smoked in for 8 years. They were extremely professional, and showed up within hours to give me a quote. It took less than 24-hours from the time I called to get a quote and have the work completed. I would recommend AC Plus to everyone.<//Review>

<Review>I am so thankful to have come across AC Plus Heating & Air in my search for repair service.  My AC stopped working overnight. It was 92° in the house! All available appointments anywhere was Wednesday including here, but my fellow Aquarian lifesaver that answered the phone put me on a waiting list with a hopeful opening Tuesday. I  got a call a few hours later for an opening today! The technician, Sean, was great! Educated me on the filter and other things and got the unit working.  From initial call to the tech's final good byes was all around GREAT service! Thank you so much!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1597777191190, 'text': "Hi Wanda Around Town, it's great to hear that our staff could help to make your experience a positive one.

This company is top notch/first class and better than any I’ve worked with in the past - all industries.  Took my initial call and scheduled an appointment immediately (even during this covid-19 craziness). Called me an hour before my appointment time to let me know Anthony was on his way. Upon arrival, diagnosed the problem with my furnace and had a plan of action in place to order the needed part. Called me shortly thereafter with the timeline to come back and repair the furnace. I wish these guys were also roofers, painters, landscapers, plumbers, whatever because I would use them for everything.

For the owner: whatever you’ve done to create this type of environment is special. I’ve been a senior executive and CEO for a number of companies and very much appreciated the customer orientation you have created. Very well done!

Thank you</review>

AC Plus just installed a state of the art HVAC system in my house. I give them a 5 star rating in every aspect of the job from the estimate through installation. Sean was instrumental throughout the process. The entire team was professional, knowledgeable and timely. 6 hours start to finish showed up with everything needed for the job and left the work area cleaner than when they arrived. I highly recommend this company. Job well done this type of workmanship is a hard to find these days.< /Text>

< Review>
I own many rental properties in Apple Valley.  Unlike other companies in the apple valley area, these guys are honest and professional.  They are usually booked up pretty badly during heat waves that crash hvac units... so i try to get other bids and diagnoses paying way too much and getting the wrong diagnosis’... and by the time my appointment opens up with them, the other guys always fall short and cant fix the problem or try to rob me... but these guys come in like superheroes as soon as they are able to fit me in and save the day!!!!   They get the diagnosis correct the first time and at a great price!!!  From now on I will just wait for these guys and not call anyone else.  Better and cheaper to just put my tenants up in a hotel for one or two nights instead of dealing with the hassle of getting an hvac guy out “immediately” and getting screwed!!!!!  These guys are the best.  You can trust Matt with everything!!!!!!!</Review>

They stated a time to start and they were punctual.  Friendly and explained why they did the installation the way the did.  When they left, they left everything cleared of debris.  This the second time I hired them, the first time was in 2005. They were the same then as now.</Review>

Blower motor went out on our heater so we called AC Plus and was able to get an appointment within 3 hours. Our technician's name is Sean and he was very professional and courteous. He even took pictures in our attic of our heating unit so we could see exactly what was wrong. His estimate of repairs was fair and reasonable and he replaced the motor in a timely and thorough manner. Will definitely recommend this company and Sean to friends and family and anyone who has AC or heating needs.< /review>

The technician couldn’t make it the first day because of snow but called and promised he would be here first thing in the morning. Arrived as promised and while here, had a power outage but continued and completed as much as possible. When power came back on, had a couple issues but Louis walked me through them and now I’m nice and toasty in my home. I will continue to use AC plus in the future.< /review>

Anthony and the other gentleman, sorry I can't remember his name, bad on names. Anyway they were both professional in manner, dress, and grooming, and courteous. They arrived on time, called first, diagnosed the problem in minutes, gave me an estimate of the cost which they stuck to, called in for the part, went and picked it up, and installed it.  Wallah!  I have heat again! I have not had heat for two days. I would highly recommend this company. I have used them before and they are prompt and know their craft and what they are doing.  They hire professional people which is evident  in their work ethic. GOOD JOB!!!!!!</review>

Very professional, friendly and knowledgeable. Can't get any better than this. During a visit to their retail store, realized it would take more work than I was willing to do myself. Tech actually followed me to my house and did the repairs. Very reasonable fees.</Text>

What sets this company apart is that they do what is best for the clients and don't up-sell or over-charge. Calling them when something stops working is like calling a trusted family member. I used their services twice to fix my old furnace. Both times Matt came and was very knowledgeable, honest, and friendly.

I highly recommend AC Plus Heating & Air. It's easy to make an appointment, a technician is sent very quickly, the service is great, and the prices more than fair. They are also very good at letting you know when they are coming so you're not stuck at home all day waiting. They are very easy to work with and genuinely care about their customers.<//text>

<review>They came out to fix my air conditioning that was working just had a funny sound instead of its quiet hum. When they were done my A/C did not work and it needed a new motor, a new wheel and motor housing. It was going to be around a $1000 to fix I told them to go ahead and do it since it was 95° or higher right now. Anyway they never got back to me I had to call them to see what was going on they gave me the run around and said it was looking more like $1500. I didnt want to repair it for that much I'd rather get a new one so can you call me, text, or email me with quotes for a new unit, needless to say they never got back two me and it's been almost three weeks. Called a new company and they were here the same day had it fixed by the next day for $700 and told me they've been fixing AC Plus's messes and overcharging around.</review><response>{'time': 1594738266757, 'text': 'Hi Chauncey Merrick,\n\nI appreciate you reaching out and letting me know of the situation. We\'ve been working on this for a couple months now & I feel its time to respond with our side of the story. When my Technician was there he gave you Pricing for the Repair which you said "No Way" to and requested Pricing for new Equipment. When he gave you pricing for new Equipment you said "No Way" and wanted Pricing for Repair. You only paid the initial Diagnostic Trip Charge. After spending a couple days getting Pricing for Repairs he left 3 different Voicemails and played Phone Tag with you for days, he ordered the Parts then you Cancelled the Repair after we brought in the Parts. We understand the inconvenience of the Parts taking days to source but your Unit is 25 years old and American Standard which is not the easiest to get parts for. Once I was made aware of your distress I immediately called you and apologized, sent back your $89 Diagnostic and called you multiple times to try and settle any issues, you now will not return our calls. Please understand that we are trying our best with this hot weather and as you can see by the other reviews, we always go above & beyond for our clients, even if it means losing money on a job.\n\nPlease call me (Matt) directly at 760-910-1394. That is my Personal Cell Phone number & I would love to speak with you & clear this up.'}</response>< gmap_id>

Matt responded to my Facebook message immediately and made an appointment to come check out our furnace first thing the next morning. He showed up on time and was super friendly. He listened to our concerns and gave us a little lesson about our furnace before telling us what our options were along with pricing and financing options. We opted to get both our furnace and ac unit replaced and he hooked us up with a great unit at an extremely reasonable price, especially compared the the other bids I received. I could not recommend Matt more highly, as he was very responsive, punctual, and met our needs at a price we could afford. Thank you, Matt!</text>

<text>I called to report that the heater wasn’t working.  I was told someone would be out in a couple of hours.  Two hours later Sean called to say he was 10 minutes away.   He checked into the problem.  Left to get the parts he needed and was back in less than an hour.  Within a half hour he had the heater working again.  He spent time explaining the problem and other resources available.   AC Plus installed our system and have been servicing it semi-annually since.  Everyone has always been professional and personable.</text>< Pics>

Excellent experience. Needed furnace inspected at home that we are in process of purchasing. Called and spoke with Matt P. He was patient with all of our questions and scheduled appointment right away. Received texts confirming appt and also when Matt was on his way, which was really appreciated. Matt was on time, extremely pleasant, professional, knowledgeable and thorough with his inspection. He emailed us the inspection report and quote the same day.  Would highly recommend AC Plus Heating & Air.<//Text>

From our initial contact with AC Plus, Matt was professional, knowledgeable, honest and upfront and still continues to be.   We believe he had our best interests at heart.  All of the technicians that came out to do the installation were courteous, professional, and very accommodating to our needs.  Thank you, AC Plus.< /text>

<text>Matt is awesome! I needed a thermostat installed and he came the same day. Besides getting my ecobee 4 installed and running, Matt caught on a few other things that can lead to serious issues later on. The cost of buying a new home is picking up the previous owners messes but he did a full analysis of everything and had a report for me ready the same day. Really knowledgeable and thorough. Definitely recommend.</text>< Resp>

When I Called AC the phone was answered by a young lady (Emily), not a ROBOT. She gave me a time & a cost for the tech to show up. She was spot on for the time, and polite. The Tech (Tony) showed up, obviously knew what he was doing, told me the cost and I said fine, fix it. It was less than I expected & the heat was fixed. I would not hesitate to call them again for any HVAC service.  Both these people need a raise!!<//text>

Hands down best heating and air conditioning people in the high desert Period. Update 8/1/19. Sean came out today to service my heater and get it ready for the winter. Did a great job. Had a lot of fun talking with him. Great to know you can trust a company now days. Been using AC plus for years now. Wouldn't use anyone else.<//Review>

They were wonderful. They were on time and very professional. So very glad we choose them.
Update: We received our electric bill and were so surprised, our bill went from $252.20 to $98.64. And yes we used the a/c. This product works great.<//text>

<Text>I want to thank AC Plus for their prompt and immediate service. We set up an appointment time and in less than 24 hours, the technician was at my my front door. Sean was very courteous, friendly, clean, thorough, and informative. He went up into the attic, got an account of the issues, provided photographs, and also inspected the outside unit, all the while explaining everything to me in plain layman terms. He laid a covering down on my carpet to catch any of the falling debri, and he left my home in the condition that it was in upon his arrival. On the spot Sean provided me with an emailed quote, explaining what needed to be done to repair my AC unit. Sean was great, and much more than I had expected from a AC service person. He most certainly provided a high level of professional during the service call. If any work is required in the future, please dispatch Sean to my residence👍👍👍 Tony W</Text><date>1568235278144<//date><GmapID>0x80c3668fffffffff:0xae953459a36a8e13<//GmapID>< pictures>

I was desperate for help with my heater.  We were freezing and it was a holiday weekend and all calls for help told me they wouldn’t be available until Monday.  Matt came and evaluated problem and though it will require time to complete the work I just needed to be reassured of what was wrong and how to fix problems which was done.  I appreciate the courtesy and professionalism shown.</Review>

<time>1611077509204<//time><rating>5<//rating><review>I recently purchased an older mobile home. Sean came out for a system check. Told me everything was fine, type of systems, how old they are, and condition. Sean had previously performed work on my previous house. He saved me thousands, literally!  Good, honest, professional company and techs. I recommend them to anyone that requires honesty and peace of mind.

Best HVAC company and personnel that I’ve ever used. I’ve been in the high desert for 18 years now, they’ve always been honest, punctual, and candid when addressing any issues. I’ve not used any other HVAC company since moving to the high desert, so I have no comparison, but their pricing seems fair. Good work ain’t cheap, cheap work ain’t good. Their work has always been excellent, you get what you pay for. This company is honest, and reliable. The techs and office staff are cordial, knowledgeable, and helpful. I work out of country, so it’s important and refreshing to know that if I have an HVAC issue, it will be resolved in a timely manner, at a fair price, and knowing they stand by their work and honor their agreements.

Our Heater went out on the day before Thanksgiving Day. What inconvenient timing. Then, with Snow in the Forecast and 28 degree night time temperature throughout the Holiday we had no choice but to call for a Service Repair.

It was one of those unfamiliar territory situations in shopping for an Unknown Company who hopefully stood behind its work, along with hopefully getting a competent Tradesman and Skilled Technician. Upon the initial call, I spoke with a very polite and welcoming Operator, of which I’m sorry I did not get her name to include in this positive review.

Well by  the Luck of the draw, we called AC Plus and Sean responded to investigate our problem. Sean was very personable and did exactly what I had hoped for and expected from a Professional Tradesman and Skilled Technician. He started at the Thermostat and went through the System Functions to verify it wasn’t Owner-Operator Error, which unfortunately it wasn’t. Then, he went on the roof to inspect the Unit. He was on the roof for less than 4 minutes when I heard the Heater ignite and the Fan began to blow Hot Air. When he came down, he took the time to show me pictures of the problem and how he was able to provide a Temporary Fix so that we could be comfortable with a Heated house through the anticipated Holiday Weekend Freeze, while he ordered the part to complete the permanent fix. Sean’s behavior went Above and Beyond what I Have experienced with different Tradesman here in the High Desert.

Unfortunately, it was not an inexpensive repair but, Sean’s Professionalism made it more palatable. Then, by again demonstrating through pictures and dialogue the physical defect requiring such an expensive repair, at least I know “I paid for what I got.” Sean was a truly Skilled Professional in Conduct and Trade Experience. Sean was also exemplary in Competent Customer Service!!!

Sean also made two followup calls to keep me informed as to the status of the Ordered part and to schedule his return for the installation of the part. I did not have to track him down or make numerous calls to pursue the completion of the job. This Customer Service was very important to me.

Thank you AC Plus for employing Sean! My faith in local Tradesman has been restored through Sean. I highly recommend AC Plus, especially Sean as your Service and Repair Technician.

<name>Cole Watson</name><Review>Unfortunately my AC Has Broken four or five times in the past 10 years that I've owned my house in Hesperia. You I use a C+ every time I have an issue and they always come quickly and fix the issue for a great price it wouldn't be that hard to get me to buy a whole new system because I know mine's old but they are very honest and they tell me when mine can be fixed when it finally does come time for a new one I know who I'll be calling< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Pics>

AC Plus has been servicing our 3 rentals as well as our own home. We have them come out in both the Spring and Fall to check our air conditioners and heaters in ensure that the units will run smoothly when the seasons start. Should we have a problem, we can count on them to respond and resolve it quickly. Their employees are always polite and pleasant to work with.<//review>

It took him 15 minutes to figure out the issue and he had my ac up and running cold again inside of an hour. He was knowledgeable and walked me through everything he was doing as he did it. He even cleaned up the mess from the last repair guy. It seems the last repair guy chopped up the wires and left it half way. Sean took the time to make it right and safe.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>AC Plus is a very professional business.  The technicians are extremely knowledgeable.  We have had our service contract for many years.  We have always had wonderful service, we have never had a time when AC Plus could not take care of any problem with our heating and air conditioning unit.  It is a great peace of mind knowing that our unit is well taken care of and we know that it will do its job.
Since we started with AC Plus, we have never had an emergency , because the unit is always inspected twice a year making sure that it is ready for the season 2021

Thank you very much AC Plus,
Jones

<text>I came from out of town to visit my son, of course on an upcoming holiday weekend, with the swamp cooler and wall heaters not being efficient. (It's too hot here, how do you people live here)
Decided to have ac, heat AND ductwork installed . Girl on phone was very pleasant and knowledgeable.  She sent Matt out and was on time, understood my situation and time frame and squeezed this BIG job in in between all of the other sevice calls.  He called in the whole crew of guys to get the job done before I left for home. The guys worked great together (as long I gave them water and M&M's.).

AC Plus is a FANTASTIC 5 Star Company that my family has used for years now. 3 years ago they Installed a new Central Heating & Air Unit in my house and we couldn't be happier. The cost was super affordable and the new system cut our electric bill by almost 50%. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</text>

This place is top-of-the-line. Emily the receptionist very nice and patient calls you back immediately or answers questions on the spot. Don’t call anyone else if you want things done fast and professional, and people that take the time to be courteous and patient with their customers. Tony the technician that came to my house was one of the best in the business fast, clean and very professional I finally found my go to place for heating and air.

Even their prices are very competitive!!!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>My significant other and I use wheelchairs. I called AC plus at 8:30 PM at night 10/9/14. Because my A/C stopped working. We are very sensitive to temperature change. Matt came over to our home at 7:15 AM the next day and looked at our system. Our system was 15 years old and we needed a new one. By 9 AM that morning Matt had a crane at our home along with a crew of people who started work immediately. Matt even brought us lunch and checked on us throughout the day. Remember this was on a Friday 10/10/2014. By 10 AM on Saturday morning our air conditioner was up and running and the workers cleaned our home.

Anthony came over to do an annual checkup on our heater. It is part of their annual AC/Heater service. He was very professional, courteous, and polite. He even made sure he had on his cloth booties to protect our flooring. He was very thorough when explaining what he was going to inspect.  There was a little hiccup in the scheduling system but that was not his fault. In fact, he called to verify my appointment time after realizing that the system had incorrectly scheduled me for a later time then initially set up and apologized for the error. I was very impressed!< /Review>

<text>Wow!   We had a heater that we were ready to replace in our home and asked them to come give us a quote to have a new one installed. They instead fixed it as a service call and gave the best customer Service you could ever hope for.   It’s great seeing a local company take such good care of their customers and not just look for the big bucks like other companies may do.   That’s how you make life long customers.</text>< Pictures>

Matt was so nice and professional. I contacted him Wednesday and he was out and fixed my cooler Thursday.! Very honest and helpful. I would recommend this company highly. My brother owns his own AC company in Vegas, far from me but I trust this company as much as my brother which is saying a lot! Thank you soo much!!!!</review>

<text>I had my AC system serviced by Matt P. Of AC Plus Friday March 17th. Can't say enough how pleased I was with the service. He was very knowledgeable, explaining every step of his process in ways that were very easy to understand. He provided great education to me as a homeowner with his service as well. He worked very fast and efficiently, while also going the extra mile (he remounted my AC box that I was too lazy to do myself!). At the end of the visit my AC was working after it had been in disrepair for over a year. The pricing was extremely fair in my opinion as well. I absolutely would recommend AC Plus and plan to use them again for any future AC service. Thanks again Matt!< /text>< gmapID>

<text>These guys didn't do a great job. Set up a business AC unit. Asked them to come back because there was something wrong with the unit. They just blamed it on the vents and offer us another solution that was going to cost us another 5000.00. asked for a second opinion and apparently our building was linked up with the unit next to us and will need to get blocked off. The vents that are outside needed to get replaced and or sealed because there were holes in the vents.< /text></record>

<Review>I contacted AC Plus Heating & Air last night to request a quote for HVAC service.  I received a response right away.  I was able to explain my needs and continued to correspond with them throughout the evening.  I received a quote for the service and scheduled a time for day later.
Matt was the technician that arrived.  He was on time, courteous, and very knowledgeable.  He inspected and serviced my heater and AC unit in a timely manner.  Explained exactly what he did and documented it thoroughly on my invoice.
I would highly recommend this company for any and all of your HVAC needs.

AC unit went down towards the end of July. AC Plus came out, identified the problem, and fixed the unit all within the same day. Timely, efficient, and fare above average in customer service. A++</Text>

<Text>I am extremely happy with their service. We have a rental property in Victorville. I first called another AC company and they came and wanted to charge me $1300 for recharge of refrigerant level!!! I denied and paid service charge and let them go. Then I called AC Plus. Matt, the manager picked up the phone. I told him what happened and he said there is an alternative refrigerant that would work just fine. He waived the service charge and was able to squeeze me in for an appt for the same day! Their technician Anthony then came on time, diagnosed the problem and recharged with alternative refrigerant, which saved me half from the other company's quote!!! He was very professional and explained the problem to me very well. I am so happy to make the second phone call to them to save big bucks!!! I would definitely recommend them if you have an AC problem in Victorville area!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>SAVING YOU MONEY!! Thats what this company is all about. Honest, Reliable, Knowledgeable...Anthony came over same day. He explained everything to me. Told me I have an old unit but all in all it was working  very well.told me it would probably last me another few years.GREAT! & that when it does start giving me problems I would probably just have to replace part of it because to my surprise he told me that a portion of it had been replaced back in 2009..He checked both heating & coolant. Both working fine.. Put in a new filter.. Iam very pleased with their service. They will be honest with you. SAVING YOU MONEY.. IAM HOOKED. THANKS AC PLUS< /Review></record>
