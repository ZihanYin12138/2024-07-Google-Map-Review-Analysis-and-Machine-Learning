< review>
Came in for a late lunch and it was still pretty busy. The kitchen had a glass window so you can see them grill & prepare your food. We got the yogurt dip with pita bread. I had them order for me since they wanted me to try other things. I ended up with a lamb kabob (1/2 kabob with rice & grilled veggies)... so tender, juicy, & melts in your mouth good. I never really thought I'd enjoy lamb but this was really good. I also tried their lamb chops & their combination plate. All really good. An order is plenty to split between two people.< /review>

Ate at this place twice while while visiting family in Burlingame- it’s so good we came back for seconds! It’s set back off the road with a big parking lot out front, so it can be hard to find. The exterior is very unassuming, but don’t judge a book by its cover; this place has excellent food and great staff! They also got our food out to us really quick. Definitely give this place a try if you’re in the area.< /text>

Was looking for a new Taqueria for lunch when I came across this place. Thought I’d give it a try. Ordered a super steak burrito to go. Got back to my office and took one bite and almost broke a molar on the steak. It was tougher than leather. It didn’t have much meat, and what meat there was tasted like it was four days old. Could hardly chew it. Very disappointed. Doubt if I’ll go back. It made Taco Bell look good.<//Review>

<Text>I was riding my bike past this great little Mexican gem. It’s a hole in wall, but the food is great. I’ve had their grilled chicken and Carnitas burrito. A lot of flavor and plenty of food. You also get chips and one of their Salsas which are good also. You might miss it if you don’t look for it. It sits off of the street in a large parking lot. There’s a large building that seems to be vacant and they occupy a corner of that building. I feel it’s a must try!< /Text>< Date>

< review>
Horchata and two tacos were about $8.7.  I've never had burria before but it's some sort of meat stew so having it in a taco was cool! Both lengua and burria tacos were a tad overseasoned but came out with a piping, hot, and generous portion of meat.  The horchata was creamy and sweet, almost like drinking cocoa puff cereal milk with a hint of cinnamon.  Meal comes with a small tray of tortilla chips.

Would come back if near the area.< /review>

Very tasty burrito.  Service was quick and friendly and the prices were very reasonable.  I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in town.  The place needs a big sign on the building and on the street.  If I wasn't searching for "Mexican food" on google maps while staying at the hotel across the street, there is no way I would have found it.  Even while standing in the parking lot, I wasn't sure I was in the right spot.   Glad I found it!</Text>

Good food in a low-key location. Don't be put off by the modest exterior. The folks who run the place are very sweet and it reminds me of the mom and pop taquerias that are all over Mexico. Good food, good prices and nice people. What more do you need?</Text>

Native Texan with a ton of authentic Mexican food at home. Se Come Asi Taqueria is as authentic as it can get and was absolutely delicious. The only thing they can do to improve would be to make the salsas spicier, even what they had marked as “very hot” was honestly super mild (but tasty).<//review>

<Text>Pleasantly surprised to find this so close to the hotel. I was staying across the street at the Hyatt and wanted something different from the hotel fare but didn't feel like driving. The Burritos were good although the sauce on the wet burrito was a little bland and salty. It tasted like it came out of a can. Otherwise the food was pretty good. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this place.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely amazing!  Some of the best Mexican food I've had in my life.  Everything cooked fresh to order.  Great sauces and salsas.  Call ahead to make sure their open, the hours seem to vary a little.<//review>

Very Disappointed! I got the Super Burrito with Al Pastor. For $11I expected a fair amount of meat, but this was not the case. There was hardly any meat! When I bit into it beans came pouring out. It was more of a bean and sour cream burrito than anything else. This is the first time I have had a runny burrito. Not good. Stop being cheap and add some meat.</Review>

First I got the wrong burrito. I ask asada and got shrimp. Then it was extremely salty. I paid $20 for some salty ass food. I should've known it was empty when I came in.< /review>

<Text>Hi, i have ordered twice from this taqueria, the first time I ordered a carne asada burrito regular, no rice, and whole beans.  When i got back to my work, instead of whole beans i got fried beans.  The second time, I ordered the same carne asada regular burrito, no rice and whole beans.
this time I got carne asada, rice, and whole beans.  How many times do i have to order the same burrito to get the right one?  Adios amigos!</Text></record></dataset><record>

There is not a better place that keeps me working as dental hygienist. They are effective without feeling Ike your being beat up. Their massage therapist are well educated in body mechanics and human muscoskeletal anatomy.<//text>

< Review>
I cannot talk highly enough of the therapists at Active Bodywork. I've been seeing Hunter but all the therapists are great at what they do! They can work out so much more tension in your muscles than you can do alone. I won't lie, it does hurt while during it, but it's a great hurt that is totally worth it since it releases the tension. I highly recommend!!!< /Review>

<Review>If you're looking for a place that delivers the hurt in order to take away the pain you've found it.
I've been worked on by four different therapists here and they're all PHENOMENAL. As a dancer, my muscles and mobility are important to me and everyone that I've seen has been attentive, personable, and knowledgeable. Every session is focused on what I need done that day (whether its my knee, lower back, shoulder, etc). Todd was able to minimize a very specific pain in my knee in order for me to perform just two days later. If you want the same treatment (sports-related or otherwise), come here.</Review></record>

Excellent massage, great space, good recommendations for follow up service, honest appraisal of underlying issues. Sandra is excellent at what she does. One of the best massages I have ever had, and certainly the best sports massage.<//Review>

It's a clean and well kept place that really knows how to take care of your needs. Natasha is great with working with you to figure out what you want to focus on and getting all those knots and everything else out of your system. And I'm sure the rest pig the staff is great also!<//Review>

<review>Finally a therapist who listens to me.
Not just a massage but Natasha focused her attention the the issues with my legs and gluts.  I left with real relief for the first time in months and still two months later the relief has been constant.  Best sports massage in town.  Give yourself a treat and go find some relief.<//review>< Response>

This business is a massage service which provides a standard massage at a discount price.   The business is clean with a basic decor.  It's setup more like the environment of a dentist office.

Reply to Business : I did not book online.   I called in.  I don't remember the details.   I was contacted by @birdeye for feedback on my experience, check with them they must have the appointment information since they knew to survey me.<//text>

Incredible massage therapists, bar none!  After many bouts of back pain from a compressed disc, the Active Bodywork team always puts me back together so that I can continue with intense training seasons.  I couldn't maintain my outdoors activities without them.< /text>

<text>This review is for sports massage services.

Based on recommendation from a friend, I booked a massage through Elite Spinal for an Active Bodywork sports massage at 9am on a Saturday with Brandon. Making the trek from SF to Sacramento takes a while, so I called several times leading up to the appointment to confirm, especially because they included the name of the wrong person in the confirmation emails.

Day of the appointment rolls around, and no one is here or answering phones/emails. I wait until 9:35, and finally an employee shows up who tells me she doesn’t have Brandon’s contact info because he’s on “the other side.” Wow, no employee directory? If you’re able to schedule appointments for the other side, why not have their contact info too? I know it wasn’t her responsibility, but she didn’t even try to welcome me in or help problem-solve.

Overall, this was a terrible experience with scheduling, very unprofessional and disorganized. I will not be making the drive up again!</text>< Name>

ABW is an incredible place and I highly recommend it to anyone who lives an active lifestyle or someone who experiences pain from existing injuries or accidents. I'm a 24yo male and live an extremely active lifestyle leading to a muscular injury in my back, shoulder, chest, and hip flexors after not recovering properly. They very easily identified the spot of trauma and began working on correcting the issue. Right from the start I could tell ABW employees are extremely knowledgeable and each action performed is deliberate and designed to trigger something (in a good way). Normal massage or recovery places simply jump right in and massage you, ABW takes the time to identify the problem areas and cater their movements to provide the best results. These guys are respectful, courteous, seasoned, and professionals. They helped advise me on ways to implement new recovery techniques to help keep me healthy. I will be returning to ABW for additional follow ups, and can say with 100% certainty that I'm on the road to recovery. Thank you ABW for all the help you provided me!</Text>

This restaurant use to be very good and tasty.  The last 3 times we ate their food, it was awful.  No flavor,  no spice.  Awful! The prices are very high.  Just not good anymore!! Blah😏🙄<//review>

I used to love this place. It was a favorite, we used to drive almost 2 hours to come back here. Not anymore. Last time we visited was October Saturday 14, 2017. The food was aweful, it had a taste of either starting to rot, having it too long in a fridge that I'm certain doesn't work well or just a bad cook...which I don't want to blame. But they shouldn't serve food that's not good anymore. We all got sick that very night. We all tried each other's food, most of it was seafood (Which we enjoy) and we all agreed it didn't taste good. I'm so upset about this because they used to be so great, I'm not sure what changed but I'm sad to say goodbye. I hope they fix or change whatever is wrong. Wish all the best.<//Text>

The plates we ordered were bland. We were given speckled and overly ripped avocados with one of our orders. Very high price for the quality of food provided. Definitely not going back.< /review>

Food was horrible and over priced. The shrimp was not cleaned and tasted really bad. The waitress charged me $25 instead of the 16.99 item I ordered. Its not about the money but about the dishonesty, I still paid it but not returning.< /review>

Fresh, very authenticc tasting from the Ceviche, rice and beans, to the Mojarra and, bacon wrapped shrimp and cocktails, the isnt a Mexican Restaurant that can too Mariscos Costa Mar out here. Take a trip there and see for yourself! But promise you wont forget to order an ice cold Michelada that comes in Schooner glass that is pulled out of a freezer, frosty with fresh squeezed lime and Tajin on the rim! Very great place to take your family or come with friends. I recommend this hole in the wall to anyone that wants great tasting Mexican food. With no advertisement besides word of mouth, this place definitely speaks for itself and its been there for over 20 years!< /Text>< Pics>

I do not recommend this place.

Excellent Service!!! went in to swap cases and upgrade my fans the price to do so was a lot more affordable than microcenter. Fast service and very helpful because I didn't have a part I needed and instead of driving to the nearest PC store to buy one which is an hour away (though it should have come with one) he scoured his store in order to find one and did. Would highly recommend!!!  They also do a wide range of services.</Text>

They told me they do not have the proper tools to work on my computer. Which surprised me because that is where I bought it. Either way it turned out fine because I came to Starbase Computer and he figured out what was wrong with my laptop, fixed it up and optimized it for me.

Both of my computers were running very slow.
The tech Henry identify my computer problems while I was waiting and gave me a quote. One needed more memory from a 4GB to 8 GB or more and for my system my drive was going bad with many bad sectors.
Henry was able to fix both of my computers and help me recover the data on a same day after I droped off before noon.
It was a very good choice that I make. Very impressive to have it ready for pickup by 5:30 on the same day.
I don't  know of any big box store that can offer that type of service.
Will knowledgeable  staff with tons of experience. This is a good computer store to have your computers service. Highly recommended.< /text>< Pictures>

The service and technical support was complete and immediate. Issues were raised and fixed that I didn't even know were happening, ultimately giving me a new computer with greatly improved innards. My laptop didn't run this well when I first got it. I would bring all my computer issues to Starbase.< /Text>

Even went back when some fans weren't working only for the boss to go over the work and clear up all fears. Great service and reliable.

Starbase has serviced my computers since 1993. Henry Young is experienced, knowledgable and willing to work until all the issues and problems have been resolved.  He is particularly responsive to critical deadlines. I have referred him to many over the years. I am proud to recommend him without reservation.</Text>

Great place.      brought in bad hard drive for recovery of data.  Henry worked on it and was able to salvage data from hard drive.  Had already been told by another company data could not be saved.  This is now my go to place.  In process henry helped get me a new gmail. account.  For amount of time spent his charge was very reasonable</review>

The owner of the store was very kind and took every step to make sure I knew what I was getting into and to educate me on what was wrong with my laptop and how to prevent that going forward. I took my MacBook in on a Saturday, and his estimate for getting it ready to pick up was the following Friday. However, he was able to complete the job and return it to me by Monday! Obviously every case will differ, but it goes to show that he cares about his customers and their experience. Highly recommend, and if I run into any other issues in the future, definitely coming back!<//Text>

<review>My laptop's body cracked and the charging port was broken so I called and swung by to get it evaluated. Henry was able to fix my laptop same day turn around when I brought it in this afternoon. He also gave me good general knowledge on laptop care. Fantastic service and very communicative on when things are going to be done. I highly recommend him.</review>< pics>

Came in for a analysis and check up of my laptop. Henry was more than helpful, he immediately identified the problems and gave us a reasonable quote. I left my computer, and a few hours later he called saying that it was ready.
Immaculate service, and attitude! Thank you Henry, I will definitely be coming back<//Review>

We have been going to Henry at Starbase for over 20 years.  He has cured our computers  of all kinds of viruses and malware.  He is happy to coach us over the phone when it seems like something we can fix. He is honest, hard working and helpful.< /Text>

Henry repaired my desktop with the installation of a new SS drive and completed the installation of WIN 10 from WIN7. Most importantly he was able to transfer most of my programs to the new drive. He then spent time with me to be sure I was happy with the installation. I can certainly recommend his shop.< /Review>

I wanted my new Apple Mac Book to be connected to my brand new printer wirelessly.  He couldn't do it.  He finally managed to make a connection via the old school way - via the printer cable.  Even that doesn't work now.  He charged me $200 for the failed connection.  NOTE re: their response below -   the response doesn't make any sense.  I was never in their store and certainly not with my printer as they describe below.  A ,man called Henry came to my house and was unable to wirelessly connect my new printer.  It worked for a week and then stopped working.  I am unable to print at all.  My previous printer worked fine with a cable connection, but I wanted wireless connection.  Henry was unable to set up either one.< /Text>

<review>Very fast, but also very meticulous. Did an excellent job on liquid damage repair on my gaming laptop, an Asus ROG Strix G. Went over every detail with me and even sent me pictures and updates during the repair. Prices were very fair. Very friendly and knowledgeable. When I picked up the laptop, we double checked that everything was working properly, together. I will definitely come back, if I need computer repair services again.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>
<review>Wonderful service.   My main desktop computer died this morning.  I called Henry and brought it in.   Within three hours he had diagnosed the problem and had it back up and running.  I had expected it to take at least a day with all the other work he had to do.  He has repaired my broken iPad screen, helped me set up a difficult RAID drive system, and fixed many other computer problems that were just out of my league.  Friendly service.  They won't talk down to you.  Henry has always been respectful of my sometimes, technical ignorance, and tenacious at finding the problem or providing a solution. Local, Friendly, Fair and Competent.  What more could you ask for.< /review><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

To tell you the truth, I felt guilty getting so much of his time for so reasonable a price. They don’t make them like Henry anymore. I am not going anywhere else from now on. If I need hardware, I’m not going anywhere else either.</review>< Pictures>

Just picked up my Dell laptop from Henry at Starbase Net Computer.  My laptop had a hard drive that took, literally, forever to boot up and bring web pages up.

I ordered an SSD drive to upgrade it, then I called Henry. He said bring it in....  I dropped the laptop off about noon, it's now 4:25 pm and it's ready to go!!

I'm a South Pasadena resident and business owner. Starbase is here too. I can't believe it took me this long to do this upgrade. Now that I have, I am thrilled to know Henry is nearby for my future PC needs.

Henry is super nice and very skilled!
I'm happy to leave this 5 star review and ecstatic with my ultra fast laptop!!!

Forgot to mention, the shop has wall to wall computer parts and supplies... fully stocked!< /text>

<Review>I would highly recommend Starbase Computer. They provide professional and high quality service for all your computer and repair needs. They provided quick, reasonably priced, and quality repairs for both my laptop and iPad.  They take the time to explain their repairs and make sure you understand costs before they proceed.  Extremely good experience.< /Review>< pictures>

Henry is a "gentleman and a scholar"! I'm not tech-y and he has always made sure I got the best repairs (a total cleaning of my computer when it had viruses) and equipment. I would encourage anyone to trust him with their computers.   A local South Pasadena Fan!!!< /Text>

<text>I brought my computer to Starbase in August for repair. Their customer service is excellent - answered any questions I had on what the problem was on my computer and explained how they were going to fix it. When I got it back, my system was running faster and up-to-date. They hooked me as a satisfied returning customer. I must say, fast turn around time and communication skills are on point.</text><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

My Macbook Air was unreliable, and I was having trouble with updating and storage, as well as problems with other major functions. My husband, who has taken his business to Starbase for years, recommended I at least let Henry and his team make a professional evaluation. I was so pleased! The laptop is now working efficiently and without any hiccups. It's once again a reliable tool, and for a very small fraction the price of a new computer! Excellent service and teamwork.</text>

Just like a car, a computer needs service every now and then. I take it here whenever I have a problem with my tower. Customer service is awesome.<//text>

Bought a brand new wacom mobile studio pro from amazon.
It was soon infected with a virus for which neither wacom nor microsoft could find a solution for, even after four hours of remote help.
I took the device to henri at starbase and he got me a clean install in two hours.

Really saved me cause I needed it done fast and clean.
Cost 150$ which isnt cheap. But after wasting an entire day trying to solve this by myself, im really glad I could find someone who could take care of it for me.
So over all, for me, the cost was really worth my peace of mind.</review>

<Review>I came here for my 31st bday and had such a blast.  The door guys are really cool and easy going.  The bartenders are fun, efficient and quick.  The crowd was perfect. 20's-mid 30's well dressed crowd.  Everyone was there to have a good time and that was all.  The decor is really nice and cozy chic.  Out of place among the surrounding establishments, but no biggie at all.</Review>< Resp>

Honestly, we had such a blast. The staff was welcoming and so accommodating.  The food is wonderful. Highly recommend the pizza. This was my first San Francisco night out and I could not have been more thrilled with the outcome. This place is a hidden gem. Will definitely come back.</Review>

Great club! I had a private event at the club for a big birthday party and it was a great space! The room is beautiful, sound system is excellent. Perfect spot for those who want to dance and socialize. Payam and Sarah took care of every need and the staff was nice and made everyone feel welcome. I rate The EndUp highly.<//Text>

<Text>Well, from what I recall, I had a blast.  Great music, strong drinks (be careful with these), lines were quick.  Totally worth the $15.  Everyone in there was having a ball.  I'll make it a point to stop here for another mash up night.  Dancing was the objective here so dress comfortable people.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Super fun place to go! Feels very underground and the place is full of hipsters and cool kids.  The music is amazing.  NOT top 40 but rather a mashup of house and hip hop alike.  The place was packed, everyone was shoulder to shoulder.  Do not go to this place if you want an ordinary club.  If you're looking for a music venue with loud music, intense crowd, and sweaty fun all over the place, then this is the place for you.< /review><name>Clint Sutton</name></record></dataset><record>

Now this is what is That City by That Bay San Francisco has that is unique and very authentic in a World that's needing something Special far away from your "Night Club me too's...

Here first of all is a Nightclub that's only open 4 fun filled Dance until you drop Night that ends vin the Day Club.
It's open Thursday-Sunday and is open 10om-10am on two if those glorious days and 10am-4am the other two.

Here lies a Digitally programmed Dance Floor your feet glide on and Sound System level beyond Thumderdome! Sakes Alive!!!.

They serve Original, Incredible Liquor beverages that have a life if their own in creation and good feelings they omit. Serve food aka originale' that keeps your body healthy and prevents you from over drinking and satisfaction full. They feature an outside (that's only seen if your inside) Oasis of world tropical trees and plants not often seen but for where in the world they're from.

In a World that's so sad and damaged from the Covid-19 life taking disease this one of a kind escape from all that plagues this Planet Mother Earth and let's the NightShine show it's ever loving light shine into your feet, body and eternal bliss hearts that so need not an escape but an alternative to Political and Bankrupt Businesses #hum drum doldrums bestowed onto/into your very bright loving compassionate Hearts and Kindred Spirit Souls. Call them or go online for exact days and late night times their open. You owe it to your Souls to primally SCREAM I LOVE LIFE AND REFUTE BAD POLITICALLY INCORRECT (SOME) DISASTERS they are to anyone for one day... Stay healthy, focused and believe in: One Day Again we'll again have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our lives again. Pls hear that you all deserve it and more. God, Jehovah Eckankar and all other Entities await your imminent return. I Love Everyone and Everything about Life I wish you all this thought: All Lives Matter for We are All deserving of #Fair and #Equal treatment...

This club is not big, but pretty cool. I came here twice. One night the DJ was mixing amazing music and we had great fun. The other night music sucked, crowd was boring and it was a disappointment. I guess I need to go third time to make up my mind about this place.</text>

Had a guest from NYC. Paid the cover for everyone at 1:59. They wouldn't serve drinks after 2, so we left immediately. Sober, we politely asked the manager to refund our cover, and they refused. Would have been great to at least had a warning at the door. $60 for 90 seconds. Absolutely, definitively, will not return, and will ensure anyone visiting will never end up at the EndUp.<//review>

Awful. Bouncers create an artificial line so it looked full on a Friday night around 2am. Cover was hefty at $20. Music was poor on a non-event weekend. Not many people were at the venue and the ones who were there were smoking weed in the back. The dancefloor was pretty bare. The people at the entry also did not announce that alcohol was no longer server beyond 2am- something that non SF natives would never know! Anyway, never coming back.< /Text>

Overcharged us on the cover fee and served us liquor that was not just watered down, but was straight water. They said they would bring out the manager but instead just provided us with actual shots. Obviously the manager knows what’s going on. Don’t waste your time or money< /Text>

Great place to hear fantastic house music of all kinds. Deep, funky, disco, vocal and electro house all call this place home. Crowd is very up for it, friendly and the atmosphere is lively and second to none in terms of having a good time. Staff s wonderful. This place is for the real, die-hard all night clubbers and dancers that aren't ready to go home just yet. Highly recommended.<//Text>

<Review>I’ve been a regular for a while...Went for a party that was advertised on facebook (twice) and eventbrite. Paid $30, and immediately upon entering it was something entirely different (different themed party, music genre, crowd, and artist). Immediately went to the cashier to ask what was happening, only to see that this is clearly not the first time this has unfortunately happened where she needs to side-step someone else's irresponsibility. She swept us aside and said to talk to the bartender’s, that’s where we’re likely to meet a manager. We speak to what we are told is a leader (shift lead/manager) and ask him what is happening. He tells us that the invite is incorrect, that we this is the party promoter and we have to talk to them and should try to get our money back.

After much asking everyone and getting nowhere, ask the bouncer if they know the party promoter, and was pointed to a man (Jeff, I believe?). long story short I ask him why the discrepancy between the event and the promotion and he gets incredibly defensive and rude. After trying to calmly talk to him he tells if we don’t stop asking questions and are not happy we’ll be kicked out. Upon realizing this we left. This was a very negative experience and I’probably won’t return.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1575052195141, 'text': 'Hi Carolina. Thank you for your feedback.

< Review>
I went last night and paid $30 for a "Dura Reggaeton" night, after being invited by a friend and seeing the event on social media. Unfortunately, the advertisement was false: the music was not reggaeton; it was Bollywood. The entire venue was empty, and the drinks were watered down with a lot of ice.

I attempted to get clarification from the staff about the event, but they dismissed my questions. I won't be returning here.<//Review>

<Text>I was so disappointed by how they treated us.

We went in after going almost every weekend, thinking it again was going to be reggaeton night based on their online advertising, on both their event page, Facebook and eventbrite. It wasnt, and when we realized (less than 5mins in) we asked for a refund. The cashier and promoted got very aggressive with us, until we felt uncomfortable and then when we complained they kicked out of the place.

Honestly, it's ok if the night didnt end up being what they planned, but I'm really not ok with how they responded. I will truly never go there again because they got so mad and aggressive with us and I dont think that's ok.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I love the End Up at 2am, 4am, 6am and 2pm.  How can you beat a raised dance floor that other dancers will you help you up onto even when it's absolutely packed?  A fireplace on cold nights.  A waterfall on warm nights.  And one of the most dependable lineups in SF.

Thank you End Up for being a staple in the SF community.  I think my first visit was in '89.  I hope you'll still be here when I'm 89.< /Text>

<review>The coolest after hours hand out and place to meet up with friends. This is for the hardcore part goers who like to enjoy the entirety of their weekends. Among other things one can find many of the locals here to meet up with and make friends in this scene. A cool place.< /review>< rating>

<review>I had fun for sure. Warning though it's too easy to stay here until 8am because free cover before midnight, alcohol and access to drugs suppliers. Though some nights there are no suppliers and just people asking you for things.

<Text>Went on a Saturday night, the cover was fairly cheap ($10). The dance floor was a little small. Drinks are reasonably priced, there is an outdoor smoking area, and while they didn't have a menu for typical bar food, they did have pizza available on site- $5 cash only. One downside was not being allowed to go out and come back in without paying cover again.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

Oct 2014 - I went to The EndUp on my last night in SF. It was a good decision and I happily arrived back at my hotel at 5am. People are generally friendly here so if you are tired from the dancing, you can start a conversation with almost anyone. The rooms are quite peculiar so I'd say keep your minds open when you visit.<//review>

We supposedly got on the "guest list" and were supposed to get in for free if we arrived before 3 or somthing like that. They charged our guy friends 70 and me and my girl 40. We were there on time!! we get inside and it wasn't even crackin. Made us wait in line for an hour but for what it was empty. If I could give it a 0 I would. DON'T COME HERE.

The Endup seems to discriminate against fat femmes. How can the cost of an event go from $0, to $20, and finally $50 in just minutes? Was it because of a patron’s body?

Venues in The Tenderloin used to be really cool and inclusive, I guess that’s a thing of the past.< /review>

A really disappointing experience. The bouncers stopped the line at the African American group to let in over 25 Asian American individuals.  It is not about race but the bouncers didn't bother to listen to use and showed no respect to the people of color in our group.  One of or group members was not allowed in for calling out the hypocrisy and the rest of us just decided to follow suit.  From a person living in the Tenderloin this is really disheartening.  I thought a place like this would be all inclusive.< /Review>

I’m not the only one lol. Do not go there. Over charges. Atmosphere not enjoyable. Also if you go you will be supporting a business that is clearly discriminatory in its practice. This is a public event. The club owner/manager and bouncers hand picks from various parts of the line based on how one looks. Bases entery price on looks. Not worth $20, $30, $50. They don’t honor the pre-tickets if you’re not female, and if you are, you have to have body or a cute face. And I haven’t seen too many females in my last few times attending. They also make it look like it’s packed by holding the line up. Don’t fall for it.</Text>

< Review>
Cover was $20, otherwise you’ll be waiting in an hour long line to get in free. Once inside the club is big and it doesn’t even fill up; maybe only 1/4, so I don’t understand the need for any type of line. They said a table is $300. I know this is SF, but so ridiculous. Not even worth it the “table” was wooden and literally only room for the bottle and your “table” doesn’t even have enough room to sit 5 people. Overall the club itself looks like any other cheap club in any other city, but because this is SF, somehow they get away with ridiculous cover. The music was alright, not worth it though. OH YEAH, they promoted the day party until 8pm, but closed by 7 and kicked everyone out.< /Review>

i ♥ ENDUP     This is the place to come and dance, meet others, chill and relax all at the same place! I love this place! The vibe and culture that the Djs and event host create for this place is amazing. Everyone everywhere is smiling and having a great time. Starting off the week with THURSDAY NIGHTS♥ and ending it through Sunday night is all you need to satisfy your night life hunger♥ I give this place 5 stars and 2 thumbs up♥ One love< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>If you are a native San Franciscan, you have a love/hate relationship with this place. You have the mecca of great dance music, eccentric individuals, drunks and music lovers. I personally love the End Up, although the lines have been pretty ridiculous since it is the only after 2am spot where you can boogie if you aren't ready to go home. They have done extensive upgrades to their couches, back room area, patio area and upper small patio area. I have always enjoyed having a cocktail in their garden and just listen to great music. Their sound system is also perfect for the size of the venue and I have never danced harder at any other venue in the city. This place is made to sweat. They have also added bottle service to their venue if that is something you are looking for at the Endup, but honestly, it is not worth it at earlier times.<//Text>< Pics>

<date>1472542254295<//date><Review>This is a fun place to go for those who loved after hours dancing and getting wasted. I dont really find this place much of the fun because the music is just okay, the drinks r bad taste, and the area are always dirty and stink. The restroom is very dirty, and small. Women, get really annoying when they r trying to use the restrom because men can share women restroom too. Also, this place is really highly well-known for party animals. You know what I mean by that.

Hope this is helpful.</Review><Rate>2</Rate><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

If you really like to be abused, please do not miss this place!!! Just as an example my beer has been stolen in a matter of 5 seconds by a bar tender right in front of a friends eyes and they responded really violently when I claimed for muy beer. In terms of music, do not expect anything too sophisticated... Even if the place pretends to be shown as cool in the internet I heard there the worst latín rubish I was trying ti escape from. As said, if you really like yo be abused, do not miss It!!!<//text>

<review>Great House Music, great dj's, a definite San Francisco institution.  This is the type of place where you can meet a lawyer to your left and a homeless artist on your right.  Most of the people that go here are into music, House Music specifically as it's one of the BEST venues to hear the newest house music in the world.  There are some drugs (as much as other bars) and less than nice bouncers, the service isn't all that great although the drinks are STRONG, the music is the best and the people are interesting.  If you're a homophobe, older, not into crowds then someplace down the street is a better hang out for you...further down the street....down in the pennisula somewhere.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>You have to be in the right state of mind for the end up...  They don't call it the end up for nothin!  If you are still awake at 4am and you aren't ready for the party to stop you just might "End Up" here.   Of course they is no liquor severed after 2am so if you don't wanna be sober I'm sure you could find other treats at this place as most sidewalk pharmacist end up here too.  I'm not sure what time the end up closes but its long after I'm passed out at home for sure.  Last time we ended up here we didn't leave until sometime after 7am.

They have an unexpected patio out back with plenty of seating I thought there was even someone selling hot dogs or something last time (but I may have just dreamed that lol)
There is also at least one pool table...  Its all a little hazy...

But if you are looking for the after party it is always at the end up.  So if you want to keep party rockin head to the End Up and pound Reb Bull all night.</Text>< Rate>

< Review>
The place had a Facebook event for a dance party from 6am-10am but when I showed up at 7am all the doors were locked and when I asked a bouncer, I was told they weren’t letting anyone in. A little disappointing.</Review>

DO NOT GO THERE
Security is rude.
Didn't let me in with my Green card. They said it doesn't work as a state ID. Ridiculous.< /Text>

<Text>The quality of  inventory at Misty's is a cut above anything else that I've seen in this region. Items are priced to sell and discounted by 15% after 30 days on the sales floor. The huge  showroom is a treasure trove of unique , often custom pieces that have been carefully chosen as opposed to the garage sale type offerings at most other consignment shops that I've visited. The team at Misty's are friendly and knowledgeable without being pushy. I'm told that they get new inventory daily and I am looking forward to my next visit!</Text><username>TOM VIOLA< /username>< gmapID>

<text>I can not say enough amazing things about this shop! I'm in ABSOLUTE heaven each time I walk in the doors! Fascinated with the quality and uniqueness of the items here every single time. I do Interior Decorating and shop for and refer all my clients here.  Its a treat to feast your eyes on every item. So worth the time and/or travel. The entire team is fantastic! If you see it- you best buy it!  It will be gone quickly : )<//text><GmapID>0x80db033320098f47:0x2c24ba998af50df2</GmapID>< response>

<text>Misty's is a great place to find something unusual, fun and even rare to buy "second hand". Plus she carries nice items. No rubbish. It's a big place, so plan on spending some time here. Misty herself is very engaging and friendly. Every week the place is choc full of different items, because she moves her inventory. If you see something you like, you had better buy it because it likely won't be there when you come back. If it sits still, Misty will put a tag on it and sell it.... fast.< /text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x80db033320098f47:0x2c24ba998af50df2</Gmap_id><text>As the owner of a high-end vacation rental company, I shop at Misty's four to five times a month.  Misty has a keen design sense and is very selective about what she accepts into consignment.  Consequently, you won't find "garage sale" pieces or prices.  What you will find is high quality furniture, accessories and artwork, tastefully displayed and priced to sell.  Misty and her team of friendly, knowledgeable assistants will go out of their way to help you find something special without being pushy.  TIP:  If you find that perfect piece (and you probably will), BUY IT! .... because it most likely won't be there tomorrow.</text>< Name>

Items set up as full rooms not just piled up all over the place. Prices vary from a steal to high but with a twist. Each month a piece sits there you get a 15% discount off the price. Sweet!<//text>

This place is a maze of furniture with rooms that dead end.  Like most consignment stores some days it's great and others not so much.  Every time I shop here I always leave thinking their prices are way too high.</review>

<Text>Misty's Consignments on Hiway 111 in the greater Palm Springs area is a very large furniture and home furnishings seller. Expect very diverse and fully stocked showrooms of what appears to be high quality second hand goods. The prices will be lower than new furniture/furnishings prices, but don't expect cheap prices. I'd call them moderate pricing on the newly consigned peices, with a price reduction program as the goods age. It's worth a visit, you might just find something reasonably priced that you must have.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely great store! Stopped by here to look to see what they have. A huge selection. I am in the process of buying a home in Palm Springs. I know where I plan to buy some items from... HERE!

I would recommend you to stop by here if you are looking for quality items. Prices were reasonable as well.<//Text>

Lots of items to look at and purchase. Prices seem pretty good. If an item has been in the store for over 30 days they mark it down 15%. Pretty much everything from artwork and rugs to outdoor tables and living room and dining room furniture</review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>About 6 months ago went here shopping with my boss who loves this place. So I see a wine decanter and I have a thing for wine and alcohol decanters ( due to him). So he buys this waterford decanter for me about $150. +   I find out yesterday that its a miss match decanter the stopped is not to the base I have.  I have a footed lismore with a stopped to a none footed. Which makes it very upsetting the price we paid it should be right.  Very disappointed.<//review>< Pics>

Well organized merchandise displaying furniture for inside and outside the home.  Lots of art work from posters to original oils.  Lamps, chandeliers,  sconces,  crystal, etc.  Consignment store.  Very overpriced.</Review>

<text>Lite and low inventory!!... Lots of dents and scratched furniture and accessories. High prices.. even for the season. Most of the quality is low. Most of the furniture seems to have been there for a LONG time. And, most of it is just old..... not necessarily good quality... just old.
Staff comes across entitled and negative. Really Sad sad for a resale/consign shop that WAS on the valleys best list.

<Text>The prices are so outrageously expensive it makes you wonder if they think you're stupid. You can buy comparable brand new furniture for less. I mean, come on, this may be higher end used furniture, but it's still used stuff.< /Text><Name>JK Sunshine< /Name>< Date>

Misty's offers a vast selection of furnishings that range in prices and decades. I've never seen such a huge selection of patio furniture as well as vintage funishings/art/collectables at any other consignment store in the valley. Just when you think you've finished....there's another room! There's also an onsite jewelry consignment area. The pricing is very reasonable here, a percentage is taken off the longer the item sits....but nothing ever gathers dust in this place. The staff is super friendly, knowledgeable and not pushy. Don't pay retail - go to Mistys!<//Text>

I've been buying from Misty's from the beginning, a lot, because I'm a stager/designer.  Service is friendly and very professional.  Great, always changing selection.

<text>3 times ordering deep dish pizza, and all 3 times they're RAW! They offer a replacement... Also raw. The last time I complained, the manager told me to to SPECIFY that I wanted them well done!getting a refund is a 20 minute ordeal... This location sucks.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I called and ordered two pizzas and stuffed cheesy bread. The food was hot and ready to go when I got there and the employees were nice.< /text>

<text>I tried online ordering, no luck. I tried by phone they hung up without taking the order, so I went in person to order. I was told we only take online orders. I went to the one on McHenry I asked the girl do you only take orders by Computer? She said, "Sir we take all orders". Even if the one that's less than a mile from home I'm going to the one on McHenry. It just so happens that I like their thick crust pizza. When I get home I fry it in olive oil. YUM!!<//text>< Rate>

Service is.....bbbbbbaaaaaaddddd...4-8 hot and ready are never available. For a pick up and run pizza join plan on spending 15 minutes sitting...no wait standing in their sun drenched chair-less waiting room. It a shame they wasted so much money on keep warm boxes...they never use them.

As I’m typing this I’m still standing here 20 minutes after I place my “always hot and ready” order.

Ok now 35 minutes later all I get is “sorry” but at least I got to sweat with 7 of my new best friends!< /text>

<Text>This is the second time I try to order from them! 1 hour before closing over the phone the first time and they say they are "closed" Second time I actually arrive to the location they have the OPEN sign on doors are unlocked and said they can't take an order because they are Closed! Hello clearly it says you close at 12 midnight!  It's only 11:00 pm!! Horrible if they don't want service then update your hours online!!!<//Text>< pictures>

I was just there last night,(near closing) and even though the employee had forgotten my crazy bread and   the pizza's I ordered were made incorrectly, and was given a VERY VERY old pepperoni pizza,  I called to let them know the guy made a mistake and he took care of it, so I went in this morning when they opened, not only was I refunded, but also compensated for complimentary pizza and crazy bread. Thanks for making it right. Never had any problems with this location,<//Text>

<review>When in yesterday to pick up my pizza and noticed that the manager was stocking cheese. She had been touching boxes and other things but never washed her hands then proceeded to sticking her hands into the dough. When I asked why gloves aren't used I was yelled at by said manager. Never going back!!< /review>< Pictures>

They hardly ever have the hot and ready actually ready. You have to wait forever. And its definitely not $5 like every commercial advertises. And also they never have change. Your best best is to order with the app</Text>

<Text>Quick stop pizza place. In and out within 10-15 minutes. But every other Little Caesar’s cheese pizza is $5 & some change but over here is high priced at $8 & some change. When asked why the customer service attendant had no clue. Will escalate this to corporate for sure!<//Text>< gmapID>

Not only do they NEVER have hot n ready pizza, they have the NERVE to charge more. Notice the menu does not have $5 pizza? Although we live right by this one, we instead travel to the one off Briggsmore and Morris. Better service, less busy and best of all...$5 pie!<//Review>

I've been waiting for 20 mins so far for a pizza....isn't little Ceasars known for a quick pizza? I probably won't be back to this location due to then not being prepared with pizzas. The staff was sweet but they should be continously producing pizzas to not fall behind.<//Text>

Ordered. Was told 10 minutes. 15 min later I ask if its ready and they say no. I ask why. She says she ended up getting more orders in...excuse me? So I just got bumped after I ordered? They say 10 more min for my pizza..so they say. No apologies from them. Asked for a refund and left.<//Review>

The employee that took my order was very rude. We walked in and he told us that since he was closing in 8 minutes he'll only give us what he had out. I thought I'd go in and be able to choose from a wide variety of options, but that was not the case. After only being given the bare minimum of what they had we took it home and it was horrible. The pizza was very thin and undercooked, there wasn't that much sauce. There was very little pepperonis on the pepperoni pizza. The dough was also very very dry. I wasn't expecting the BEST quality service but I was a paying customer so I should've been treated better than I was. I also shouldn't have been served a half ass made pizza. They really need to step up their services at the establishment.<//Review>

We asked for a simple deep dish pizza then they put on our receipt that is was something different and then gave us something different then on the receipt. The pizza was good-ish.< /text>

I used to love this location for their pizza.
But since the new remodeling, they replaced the whole staff which also made the pizza suck.  I wish the old staff was back.  I used to only go to this specific location even if Roundtable, Papa John's, Papa Murphy's, or Mountain Mike's were more convenient . Their pizza was that good. Now I am so disappointed with how nasty their crappy cardboard pizza is, I don't go there anymore.
The last time I was there I preordered a pizza  without onions. When I came to pick it up, I noticed onions were in it and the young guy making it picked the onions out with his fingers(no glove) and handed the pizza to me.... I never went back except to see if the old staff was back.< /Text>

The service has been terrible lately yesterday my brother was told 10 minutes just to have to wait 1 hour just to be told that well the pizza isnt ready yet and that if he wanted he could just take what they had ...so okay whatever took it just for it to be cold ......this has happened on more than 1 occasion and very disappointed dont know if you need retraining or better management .......come to this store because its closer but looks like i will have to head to a different location< /review>

<review>This is the worst location I've ever encountered. Every time we call to order a pizza the employees are rude as all get-out, and try to tell me they don't take corporate coupons that they literally left at my door a week ago. The pizza toppings are never as I order them, and trust, it's not complicated. They burn the damn pizzas or they're undercooked. My favorite part is when they're busy, they take their phones off the hook so you can't order. I've called the owner and franchise lead and apparently they don't care. Never ever go to this location!<//review>< time>

Always takes a while to get the pizza, never hot and ready.  Also if you call ahead you will need to add at least 15 minutes to the time they quote.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Called over the phone for 2 piercings, missed the placement in over the phone translation but ended up being exactly what I wanted. Bianca did amazing!! She walked me through proper care, expectations for the pierce and she made sure I loved the positioning. I can’t wait to go back for more piercings and my first tattoo!< /Text>< user_name>

Bianca is fantastic! She pierced our five year old daughter’s ears and we couldn’t be happier. She was professional and friendly.  She demonstrated and explained each step to our daughter. I highly recommend her.</Text>

Jason did an outstanding job of my tattoo of skulls in a pot. He knew exactly what I was going for and gave great tips and advice on placement and future references for a sleeve. Love him & this place! :)</review>

Not only is this such a neat little tattoo studio with a unique style to it, my piercer Bianca was such a pleasure to get to know and have pierce me. She loves her profession and genuinely cares for her clients, I will definitely be coming back and will be telling people about how great this shop is🖤 (she did my bridge for me😋)< /text>

Loved the work they did for me. Very clean environment, very cool atmosphere.

The tattoo work done by Elvis had very clean lines, and he took the time to make sure everything was filled in. He also worked with me to help edit the tattoo to make it perfectly contour my arm.

This place is one of the best I've been to, they really know their stuff. Prices are very fair especially for the quality of work performed.

Will come again.</review>

<Review>I came in for a walk in today. Everyone was super nice and the shop looked really cool! Everything was really clean and the artists seemed like they knew their stuff.

I just got a small tattoo from Elvis but he was sort professional and took his time. He even touched up some old faded ones and suggested he add something to make it look better. I liked his idea.

Love the shop. I'll definitely come back!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I got my little sisters piercing done here and all was fine. Well a few days after, the piercing ended up inside her nose? I have my own piercing and when I did it, nothing like this happened. We did some googling and turns out if the piercer didn’t do it right, this happens. I wouldn’t trust the piercer again. On the upside, they were very nice. But the piercing is literally inside her nose.

Update: went to another piercer and had gotten it fixed. Thankfully, nothing got infected.</Text>

<Response>{'time': 1562025538863, 'text': 'Hi Kameryn. Thank you for bringing your sister in. It’s not common place to get a third party review so please read this response to your sister. It is unfortunate that this happened to your sister’s piercing but this review is a bit of a fallacy. Swelling. Swelling is what can, on occasion, cause something like this to happen. Information of this happening is also available on Google. It is difficult to anticipate how much someone is going to swell. The jewelry is provided with adequate length to allow for some swelling to happen. At times, some swelling happens above the average rate. Generally when this happens, the client contacts the shop or the piercer directly, rather than google, to address this issue. Had your sister done this, this matter could have been very easily addressed and remedied. All of our contact information is available on Google. In the future, please, before a review like this, contact the one who provided the service so you, or who you’re representing, can get the appropriate feedback and alleviate whatever the complaint might be. Incorrect information in a review such as this can also negatively impact others not in any way involved in the situation.'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Elvis did my husband's and I tattoos. We were walk-ins just being spontaneous, then after we gave him somewhat vague details of what we wanted he was able to draw and tattoo amazing pieces of art. Definitley recommend him for great quality work!<//Text>

This is one of the best tattoo shops in Escondido. I went there today with one of my friends for her fourth tattoo (her first at this particular shop), and she was extremely pleased with Darren's work. The facility is obviously clean, the staff, artists, and other patrons are friendly, and the prices are reasonable. I'm very likely to return to DermalGrafix for my future tattoos and piercings.</Text>

We went here because the artist Darren has deals on his page. He's really chill and understanding. We went for a tattoo for my husband and then 3 days later for a friend to get his first tattoo. If you're looking to get tattooed, I would say go here and see Darren or Elvis. They are chill guys and can do exactly what you want to decorate your body 😂< /Text>

Got my second tattoo with Liz and it came of better than I could have planned. She brings energy, passion, professionalism, and a level of artistic skill that can’t be matched.  I highly recommend Dermal Grafix for anyone looking to get a quality tattoo.< /review>

Elvis is the man! I have been to several tattoo artists but by far he was the best I have ever worked with. Literally from start to finish. His work was undeniably good, the shop was clean just like his work and he was such a cool and amazing dude who truly cared about my tattoo turning out exactly how I wanted it, and treated me like I was his #1 patient. Also made the 5 hours of tattooing well worth the money I put into it (which was nothing prepared to other artists) I can't say enough about this guy. Thanks again and I look forward to getting my next masterpiece with you brotha!< /review>

Best tattoo shop I've ever been to. I had a last minute request and was accommodated not only for myself but three others. Excellent tattoo work and very professional. Keep up the great work. I live up north but will be making the trip down again soon. This shop was worth every penny and quite frankly could have charged far more. Kenny, you rock brother.< /Review>

I had a piece done on my should by Liz and the customer service was awesome. Idk what the other guys was talking about. They all greeted me as I walked in came back while she was doing it to see how everything was going. They joked around it was an overall fun great experience for me. I would recommend this shop to anyone I know. And I do! I will definitely be going back. Great atmosphere!</Review>

<review>I had my very first tattoo done here. I was amazed at the work Grant McConnell did. I wanted something to represent my mother and since she passed away from cancer I wanted to incorporate it in a tattoo... He did amazing work!
I am looking for another tattoo and I want him to do it because he is awesome at his work!
Thanks again Grant for making my dream come true!</review>< Gmap_id>

my sisters and i went to this tattoo shop last friday, to get ear piercings. both my sisters and i ended up having horrible experiences. the piercer that we had (a lady with a bad attitude) right off the bat was very rude and you could tell she didn’t want to be there anymore. my sister and i got our cartilage pierced and our tragus pierced, and for the tragus, the piercer put in the wrong jewelry. she was supposed to put in a curved bar, and instead input a straight bar, that was meant for the lip. on top of that she didn’t not tighten the ball at all and it ended up falling out today. the piercer was supposed to have us lie down on the chair while piercing our tragus and she had us sitting up the whole time, and did not even tell us how to care for our piercings when we left. today when my ball fell out, i decided to go to another tattoo shop to get it fixed, and i decided to go to good neighbor tattoo in san marcos, and thank god i did. Anisa was my piercer here and she was literally the best. she immediately told me everything wrong with the piercing i had gotten and she gave me my options on how to fix it. she ended up putting a curved earring in my tragus, and helped me to clean up the infection i had a little bit. i highly recommend going to her to get any piercing because she was amazing. it literally did not hurt nearly as bad as it did when i initially got it pierced. she made everything clear that she was doing and you could tell she loved her job and cares about her clients. before going to dermal grafix, please consider going to good neighbor tattoo first. you won’t regret it.< /review>

{'time': 1569350106045, 'text': 'Hi Priya. Thanks for coming by for our Friday 13th event and thank you for taking the time to leave a review. I think though, that your time would have been better spent contacting us to have the ball put back on the jewelry. Sometimes, regardless of it being tightened by the piercer, the ball can come off and it can be remedied in the matter of seconds.\nI would like to take a few moments to also address your other mentions. We at DermalGrafix strive to ensure our clients have a great experience at the shop. Our Friday 13th events can be a very high volume day for us as I’m sure you can recall. Our piercer remembers you both and recalls the experience quite differently. She did mention to you that the day has been busy and due to a previous injury she had some back pain. We regret if this had made you feel as if you didn’t receive the proper attention you felt was due.\nIn regards to the information you’ve received from Anissa, it is just incorrect and subjective from piercer to piercer. I know her personally and she’s great at what she does, but has left you misinformed about this piercing process. There is just not a single type of jewelry to be used nor a single mandatory position in which one should be in getting that piercing. If you’d like, please do a brief google/YouTube search for that piercing and you’ll see.\nI do hope that in the future, before leaving another review like this, you might consider that some information is subjective. Also that a review like this can potentially effect others that have nothing to do with the situation negatively. We would greatly appreciate you removing this review in light of what I’ve shared with you in this response. If not, I hope that you might have other considerations before another review. Again, thanks Priya. Hope to see you at the shop again.'}<//Response>

Rebecca did an amazing job microblading my mother's eyebrows! Natural and age-appropriate. Also, Rebecca was very clean and took her time to get it right. 10/10 experience. (The photo was taken immediately after the procedure so she’s little red)<//text>

< Review>
I’ve been coming here for my Dobermans for a few years now. The ear cropping is amazing. Vaccinations are timely and affordable. The quality is 100% recommended. Had my puppies ears cropped here this weekend and at first the assistants did a bad job with the paper work. There was a mix up but doctor was great. He does an amazing job and got everything situated with our case. He made sure to give us a discount as well. They are a little backed up due to covid so it’s easy to get mixed up. They are very affordable and convenient as well as flexible. I will continue to come to American Pet Hospital! It honestly is a great hospital.<//Review>

<Review>This vet used to be my favorite after giving them many chances to change their service I’m never going back. They treat dogs so disgusting. They don’t know how to make your pets feel comfortable. The receptionist are absolutely worthless. They mix up your damn paper work. I will never recommend this place ever again. A side from that they screw up your ear cropping after consistently repeating yourself about the style. This place needs to be shut down.</Review><user_id>118133681630432629275</user_id><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

< Review>
They misdiagnosed my dads dog yesterday, their older doctor told my dad it was an ear infection, it wasnt, the dog was bitten by another animal and had dead skin from the bite, the dead skin was covering about 20% of the dog, and the vet told my dad to just put down the dog, it was too much work to save the dog. Its skin. Its superficial.  For some people,  their animals mean everything to them. Please take your dog to someone else like we did. We took the dog to empire pet hospital where they said the dog can have laser surgery . The dog was given the care it needed at empire pet hospital . Dont waste time and money taking your animal somewhere where your animal may be misdiagnosed,  and your told to just put down the animal.  Please.< /Review>

I’ve been taking my pets to American Pet Hospital for over 20 years and have had a great experience with Dr. Sandhu specifically.  He has been flexible with meeting my pet’s needs, has provided resources, and great service. The staff have always been caring and kind. My one complaint, the wait time, which was voiced,  was responded to in a professional and invested way.</review>

Absolutely horrible treatment, lie to you about what is done to your pet (said mine had surgery for one thing, came back months later and they claimed that surgery never happened. Even showed paper to prove us wrong that they didn’t do the surgery they told us they did. ) the receptionist is awful, rude and talks down to you if you have questions.</Text>

<Text>This has been my dogs vet for the last 5 years this was her vet.. I get it they are overwhelmed and busy but the quality has gone way down.. first off, they are so behind it takes an hr or more wait time to get your pet seen... when talking to you they always call you honey and dear which is said in a condescending way... Regarding the vetrinary care.. despite dog vomiting and dehydrated for a week already, they Sent us away with no labs saying it was the food and then later that week when I try to re order her medication they said it required labs to prescribe a routine medication. Made another appointment for lab's and they said my dog needs a new medication for her liver, saying the other vet will follow up but no follow up. Try to order med through 1800 pet meds still no follow up despite other dr saying the order would be approved. Meanwhile my dog is still vomiting and i was trying to follow up today but couldn't  even leave a message since teir mailbox is full which wouldn't be a problem if they answered the phone. Take your pet elsewhere if possible. They are too busy to care anymore.< /Text>< pictures>

I have been taking my dog for the last three years and the staff has been absolutely wonderful in every visit. One of the reasons why I continue coming back even though I don’t reside in Modesto, is because of Dr. Sandhu’s sincere love and care for my little one.<//text>

< review>
This place got me and my cat Gray-C in within a few hours of calling. We’re new patients but my mother-in-law used to have her dog treated here. My neighbor also brings her German Shepherd to American Pet Hospital. Needless to say they came highly recommended. Their bedside manner is better than any vet I’ve been to in Modesto, hands down. Theresa was super sweet, very knowledgeable and eager to provide comfort while doing an awesome job of caring for my febrile, sick cat. When I called to request a copy of the test results, Liz was kind and helpful. Her efforts re: my request were appreciated since some place I’ve taken my animals to, which shall remain nameless, acted put upon or inconvenienced when asking ANYTHING of them. I’ve got one cat in addition to this one about which I’m posting as well as two dogs and have decided that this place is our new home for all our veterinary needs. Thanks again ladies and Doc, your excellent care of my fur baby is so greatly appreciated.< /review>

I am highly pleased with the service I received with American pet hospital, they cropped my puppy’s ears (he’s an American bully) they came out excellent and I recommend the laser treatment. The staff was very friendly and helpful. 10/10 overall. I highly recommend them for any pet needs !<//Review>

<review>Dr. Sandhu told us directly that if we wanted better care for our pet we should take our pet to Standiford. I think people should listen to his advice regarding that and avoid this place at all costs. The negligence at this vet hospital called our family dog. The medical reports are a SHAME, the bed side manner is unprofessional, and they have unlicensed, uneducated staff members conducting services that are supposed to be for licensed vet techs only. Avoid this place if you care about your pets life.</review>< Pics>

Pet killer!
This sorry excuse of a vet needs their license taken forever. They should never be allowed near an animal! They killed so many people's pets and refused to let them see their pet to say goodbye. And then they turn around and charge for murdering your pet. They also refuse to give the logged info on what happened. This place needs shut the hell down!<//review>

They helped me with a surgery on an eye when another Vet was unable to care for my dog. They have done OFAs for me. I've used this office for flight precheck, and puppy health certificates.
This is a great place to get your pets spayed or neutered, vaccines, or to set a broken leg. But also a great place to go when you need advanced care.< /text>< pictures>

This place is HORRIBLE. I took my Pomeranian here when she was very sick because her original vet place was closed and they left her a horrible bruise on her arm. Once I took her back to my vet for a checkup and seen the bruise she had they were terrified!< /review>

<review>Took my dog to get his ears cropped during this COVID19 time we have going on. I was thankful they took him in but not happy of how the other process was. I told them that I had to get the sutures out and get the ears wrapped. The 2 ladies on the phone said no that I could only have the sutures out but not the wrapping, that if I wanted a kit I would have to pay 25 per kit. My invoice states 2 wrappings included. Overall not helpful at all. Only reason the 2 stars is because of how the cropping came out.</review><rating>2</rating>< gmap_id>

The ladies at the front mean well but customer service needs to improve. I saw the vet a few days ago and was told to come back for her surgery. I came back at the assigned time and the receptionist took 5-7 calls before addressing the customer in front on her with the appointment. My dog was not worked on till 5+ hours after her appt time. When I called at 3 the receptionist said my dog was in stable condition. My dog hadn’t even been able worked on so of course she is in stable condition. The office needs to update their customers if they are running late. I usually like the vets but don’t come in like you are a badass and not acknowledge the customer standing right in front if you. The front office did not know what my dog was going to be removed even though she had a prior visit and had all paperwork but was told nothing was written down and then told computer was down. If the computers were down in a hospital there would be some serious lawsuits and problems if something didn’t go the way it should have. I have a business and deal with customers all the time and this place needs work on basic customer service.< /text>

Overall my experience here was great. The Doctors and the staff seemed very knowledgeable and budgeted well within my needs.  I took my pup here to get shots and they immediately told me I could save money with the puppy plan. Girls upfront are very inviting as well!< /Text>

< Review>
Camry at the front desk is a delight, and happens to love our dog which makes it so fun. Kim is always helpful and kind too, even though they’re both quite busy. The prices are fair as well, which is a huge benefit, and they take Care Credit. We recommend APH to everyone we know. *** Update *** I did take one of my puppies here at 5 weeks, since she always struggled to grow and had some obvious health issues. I ended up seeing the older vet; I think his name is Dr. Jacobs. He didn't really give her much of an exam and just said she was 'genetically weak' and would always be sick. He took her temp rectally and pushed it in about 2" into a 6" long teeny pug puppy. She cried out and continued to, as he bent the thermometer around to read it while it was still too far inside her. :( When it came out it was bloody, and he brushed off my shock, saying "They don't make those things for babies!" I don't like to give them this report, because I do like the front staff a lot, and Dr. Sandhu has been good to us, but I'd hate for anyone else to have that experience. So, if you go, see Dr. Sandhu. There can also be pretty long wait times - up to an hour.</Review>

<Time>1526677608227</Time><Rating>1<//Rating><review>The worst customer service experience I have ever had. In any field. I coordinated customer service seminars for years and I would be happy to give some MUCH NEEDED advice:
1 - don't hang up on callers
2 - say, "do you have an emergency, or can I place you on a brief hold" before you rudely cut the potential customer off and put them on hold
3 - subscribe to a hold recording service rather than have someone listen to dead air for a few minutes.
4 - don't cut off a person mid-sentence (that is basic proper social etiquette)
5 - take notes if you have a problem with concentration and information retention so the caller is not having to repeat themselves
6 - smile when you speak. It reflects through your tone of voice

Your front office staff is the first contact a potential client has with your clinic.  Invest in the best team possible.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

This staff is very friendly,  you can tell they love the job.  The vet is knowledge and the animals seem to like him.  This vet is clearly not in it for the money.  I shopped around and he had the best prices.  The meds are adorable and they have no problem  calling it into your local pharmacy if you need them to. If you have pets you need to check them out.  They are open 24 hours too!!!< /Text>

<username>Jessica Gonzalez<//username><Review>My dog is epileptic so she takes the drug phenobarbital. Every month I have to go in and get her a new prescription. I guess according to the state law, I have to take her in once a year for blood work, which I understand. It is around $120 dollars. It didn't have the money on top of the office visit fee, so I asked the doctor if he could wait until several more months until I was able to take my dog in for blood work, but that I was able to continue getting her medication. He said it was fine that I do that. Well, it has only been a month since my dog ran out of medication and I called the hospital to get her prescription refilled. Well, when I called they didn't have anything in my dog's file that the doctor said it was okay for me to get the prescription again even though he said it was okay a month ago. Not only that, the lady that told me that it was a controlled substance and made me feel like I was using it for personal use. I have angry, but held it in. She also said that the last time the doctor seen my dog was last year and they need to see her again. I understood, I have already talked to the doctor. I had more than one incident to and the staff is very rude. Once I am able to better afford it, I am taking both my dachshunds elsewhere.< /Review><rating>1< /rating>< Pictures>

<text>The doctors and the staff here are wonderful to our pets and to our family.  They have helped  both keep them alive and well.  And sadly have helped some pass. They are very compassionate and truely care.  Id never go to another vet.  After 19 years going here they are family. What other vet would stab open late just for your pet?  And the prices you cant beat anyplace. All around I can't say enough about this great office.< /text><Time>1471465510478</Time>< userid>

< review>
I’ve been taking my golden retrievers here for years but never have been satisfied. (5 different dogs total)
My last straw was when I took my 9 year old golden for a check up on his ears. I had an appointment at 2 PM didn’t get into a room until 245 waited for a veterinarian doctor for 15 minutes , Just for him to walk into the room, he takes a deep breath, and he says your dog stinks I know exactly what he needs, walks out and he comes back 20 minutes  later with the price of the operation. EXPENSIVE. OBVIOUSLY.
I was really upset because fiRst of all, HE DIDNT EVEN TOUCH MY DOG. HE  OPEN THE DOOR, inhaled and closed the door. All for $80 while Ranger waits to  greet someone new .
I immediately commented and said you didn’t even  look at my dog. He commented “Honey I’ve been doing this for 50+ years I know when I smelt him, what it was.” I replied “ I don’t appreciate how you said it, you were quick, you didn’t even touch or greet him”.
I think they are very unprofessional and just because you’ve been doing this for a very long time, doesn’t mean you know everything. Rude, greedy, and not right to be a vet. Don’t EVER treat my Golden like that again.<//review>

They basically butchered my dogs for spay and neuter procedure. Luckily they survived, but they will have scars to last them the rest of their.  The stitches are sloppy and haphazard. I regret bringing them here and will never go there again.< /text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>They cropped my doberman ears at American pet hospital and I was satisfied until the wrapping step. They over tighten the tape cutting my puppies ears circulation I took him in for them to wrap his ears again but when they took the tape off they hurt his ears taking some skin off. I had to post my puppies ears myself thank god they came out good. I Won't ever consider takin my pets there again.< /Review>< gmapID>

Usually owners are given a list of things to watch for after their pets surgery, a number to call if problem occur. Nothing. There website states they offer a senior discount, not true. "That's from our old website" . Really, I think they should update the site and not deceive seniors. Seemed like they were not concerned  or were unaware as to how to best  serve their clients and pets. Not what I expected nor used to regarding animal care.< /Review><date>1399675386703</date></record></dataset><record>

I seriously LOVE everyone who works at American Pet Hospital.Talk about customer service... they treated my 2 dogs like kings. i walked in and the place was packed. yet they were extremely efficient in getting my dogs treated. i have no reason to go anywhere else....any negative comments on here are probably from people who cant afford it. and believe me.. they were very affordable. thank you so much Dr sandhu!</Review>

<Review>I'm so disappointed after today's appointment. This was my third visit and the first two went very well. I was reccommened by the breeder (From Vallejo) that this was the best place in town and after today when I pretty much got yelled at by a Dr Jacob. (He was very rude and judgemental) I told him I did not want to make any decisions on more vaccines until my Fiance was with me. Dr Jacob at this point still continued to raised his voice and went about saying how the breeder I got my puppy from did not give proper vaccines and it was almost like he was threatening and trying to scare me into making a decision telling me with his voice raised on how long he's been a Vet and so on... Even tried to force me to call my Fiance at his work to get an answer. Wow is all I have to say. To be treated like this was very uncomfortable and I wished that Dr Singh or Dr Sanduh would have mentioned anything to me that was reccomended when I had the two visits prior with my Fiance.</Review></record>

I would NEVER recommend anyone to bring their animal to American Pet Hospital on coffee rd in Modesto. By far the absolute most insensitive, and inconsiderate staff. My dog, who meant more to me than anything else in my life, recently passed away so I took him to American Pet Hospital the morning of June 26th right when they opened, so I could have him cremated and bring him back home. I had a lot of concerns about this process, but my main question was, "When can I pick him back up and bring him home?" They made it clear to me that "within two weeks" someone would be contacting ME, to go pick him up. So I waited two weeks and a day then called, I was told they don't know where he's at in the process yet so for me to call back...this went on for one month. I got really irritated and told them if it was going to be longer, to at least give me that realistic time frame instead of having me run circles not knowing what's going on. Every single person I had talked to over this passed month has been extremely insensitive and uncaring and unhelpful. I was promised that YESTERDAY he'd be ready for me to go pick up. I had to work so I called today first thing and now they're telling me possibly Thursday because they messed up on what I wanted written on his plaque on his urn box. Like are you kidding me???? They do not see this is a priority when it really needs to be one. For most people, their pet is their life. The fact that my pet died, and they saw how distraught I was the morning of his passing, taking him in, and they're in no hurry to return him or even at the very least be kind in helping inform me throughout the process, shows a lot about the way they treat their patients and their patients owners. Not ONCE have they ever called me this past month. I've called multiple times every week. I hope none of you ever experience what I'm going through with them. Not only am I already going through a really heartbreaking time because of my loss, but American Pet hospital's staff is just adding such a huge load of more pain and stress to this time for me when they should be most sensitve. DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR ANIMALS. By the way, tomorrow marks one month of dropping him off and I still do not have him back in my custody yet.</text>

<Review>Horrible service! What ever service they did do I paid over a hundred dollars on blood work that they never showed me the results to on top of that they took my dog to the other room to do the blood work I asked if I could go back with her I was rudely Told NO! By the end of the visit we were told that our dog has stage two kidney failure and could die at anytime. That was in April. Since then she has gained weight and the symptoms she was having seemed to have faded. I honestly think my dog may have had a kidney infection she is 14 years old, but trying to sell us expensive medicine was the drs main focus. MONEY HUNGRY!!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>They were not able to recognize Bartonella in my kitty even after I paid several hundred dollars to them. They wouldn't tell me if they actually did or did not give my cat the antibiotic i paid them to give her. They force her mouth open and shoved food down her throat and released her to us without caring if she was actually ok. When i called and told them that my son has Bartonella and really needed to know if my cat had an antibiotic or not and what blood test i paid for the girl answering was rude and never called back. If you care about your pets or children do not go here!< /text>< Date>

I went with my mom to put down her cat that was sick this last weekend. The front lady clerks were so nice. As for the Indian vet that actually put down our fur baby.... WHAT A EFFIN JOKE. He never once explained what exactly was going to happen (which an owner needs to know to confirm their fur baby will be put down peacefully) Then he went to administer the injection and had his assistant physically hold down my moms cat instead of asking if she wanted to comfort him. SERIOUSLY? So not compassionate. They didn't offer a sedative before hand and we truly didn't know that makes the horrific experience a bit more easier... so he directly injected the meds to stop the heart without one. Then when our poor babies eyes didn't close my mom asked "Well is he gone?! His eyes aren't closed yet!" And he responded "They won't close. It's okay. His heart will eventually stop." Then left the room. IF YOU EVER WANT TO HAVE A PEACEFUL AND HUMANE GOODBYE WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR BABY PLEASE DONT GO HERE. The experience was sooooo traumatizing I wouldn't ask this on my worst enemy. 💔 you shouldn't even be called a vet if you can't give every one of your clients the time & respect they deserve!< /review>

They killed my cat. They did her procedure to fast. She was on ivs and they gave her the antibiotics to fast and she didnt have any energy to fight. If anything is that sick why pump that medicine in then. Wait for the ivs to kick in then when she seems like she has energy give it to her. I will never trust them again. Screwed me out of hella money. Doctor was rude over the phone telling me my cat passed. And my cat has been dead sinse last night and I an finding out at 1 oclock in the afternoon<//Text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Recently I went to American Pet Hospital because my dog had an eye infection. I usually go to my normal vet but it is a bit of a drive and being that this clinic was close I thought I would try it out. Upon coming into the clinic I noticed that the front desk woman was constantly leaving her desk to use the bathroom so a woman who I am assuming is a vet tech at the clinic had to step in to help us out. She had us fill out paperwork and almost right away called us into a room to wait for the vet. Which seemed good at the time only we sat in that room for close to 30 minutes waiting to be seen in a clinic that was no where close to busy. So after bringing this to the front desks attention they responded" wow you havent been seen yet?! I wonder what the hold up is? You guys have been in there forever." Immediately after we said something the vet came in. He took one look at our dogs eye and took a guess that he had a fox tail stuck in it. He wanted to put him under local anesthesia and put a needle into his eye to probe around and see if there was a foxtail stuck in it. He went on to say that this would cost maybe a few hundred dollars! I was shocked, I have been around animals all my life and I know the first thing a vet will usually do is examine the dog and then put a colored liquid in their eye to see if there is a scratch first before suggesting anything more serious. I asked him why would he suggest something so evasive when he only took one look at his eye? He said that he just wouldnt know what the cause of problem was until he got a good look around in his eye. I was horrified. We waited for 30 minutes only to have a vet look at our dog for 50 seconds and then talk to us for 1 minute about probing into our poor dogs eye while he was only under local anesthesia for hundreds of dollars!!! So I decided to leave, I wasnt going to put my dog through this when I was sure it was just a simple infection or a scratch. While waiting to pay my 28 dollar "visit fee" which should have been waived since the vet spent a whole 2 minutes with us,the front desk woman talked to a man about his cats  when she could see we were ready to pay and leave. So after waiting for a long time we decided to walk out after that horrible experience and only when we walked out did a vet tech run after us saying that we didnt pay. We gave her the money and when we told her what the vet had said she just said "oh yeah yeah..." as if that was a typical thing for him to rush to do an extreme surgery before checking anything out before. So we left extremely upset with this awful visit.The next day we took our dog to our normal vet where we found out he just had a scratch on his eyeball, we will have to apply ointment on his eye for it to heal, they found this scratch without using any needles or putting our dog in any pain like the vet at American Pet Hospital suggested. I apologize for this post being so long but I am simply appauled that there is a vet out there performing or suggesting to perform services like this on innocent animals who may just have a simple problem like a scratch on his eye like my dog did. In my opinion this vet just wants to make money by charging his clients for unncessary procedures. So if you care about your animals please do not take them to this clinic. The vet visits may cost a little more else where but your animals deserve better care than what this place offers. Worst vet visit I have ever been to, from the front desk to that vet, they should all be ashamed of how they run that clinic.<//Review>< Date>

<review>They prescribed wrong medication.They killed my dog.  They are not equipped for real problems.  They did not even try to save my dog.  He walked in and we had to carry him out, DEAD.  I'm sure these people have made a lot of enemies.  They should be jailed.  Curse is removed.< /review>< pics>

<Review>My kitten was traumatized by his treatment there. Besides that, the staff are very rude and don't seem to actually like animals, oddly enough!</Review>< Pics>

<Time>1629945184503</Time><rate>5</rate><text>I know SLO Smiles is well-known and loved by many in San Luis Obispo but I only recently made the switch and couldn’t be more pleased. Earlier this month I had my first appointment with Dr. Ian Leopold and it was immediately apparent why this practice has such a loyal following. Dr. Leopold and his knowledgeable assistant Gena were exceptionally patient with my every question and kindly brought me up to date on all the latest advances and treatment options available for my aging gums and teeth. Their willingness to listen to my reticence with empathy and understanding not only lightened my concerns but opened me to treatment possibilities I hadn’t previously considered.
SLO Smiles IS the best -  it’s no wonder they’ve won “Best of SLO” three years straight!< /text>< pics>

<review>Dr. Leopold is one of the best dentists and works at SLO Smiles. He is dedicated to addressing the root cause of dental issues. Whether it is proposing ways to slow dental decay or correcting the feel of a new crown, the staff at SLO Smiles spends time with their patients to do the job right.

SLO Smiles has acted diligently throughout the COVID pandemic and reportedly had zero staff infected with the virus.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1628179056279, 'text': 'Thank you so much for reviewing us!

Wonderful dental office.  My husband and I have been coming here for years and have always been really happy with the care we have received.  Everyone on the staff is friendly and helpful and makes you feel cared for and in good hands.  They offer 7am appointments to see the dental hygienists which is also really nice!    We live in south county and the drive into SLO is well worth it.    Highly recommended!!< /Text>

Just completed my first appointment at SLO Smiles and I will never go anywhere else! Dr Main and Brittany were super thoughtful with answering all of my questions and providing me with useful solutions. Dr Main did a very thorough examination and set up the perfect treatment plan for me. I even got to see my bacteria under a microscope to learn how to better prevent having bad bacteria! Highly recommend, I’m already excited for my next appointment.< /review>

For over 10 years I have been a patient of Dr. Leopold at SLO Smiles.  The office is immaculate and the ladies at the desk are always helpful.  Tiki my hygienist and Gina, Dr. Leopold's assistant , are very professional.  I never dread going to SLO Smiles because Dr. Leopold, besides really caring for his patients, has such excellence and expertise I know that I am being treated with top-of-the-line care.  I am so fortunate to have found SLO Smiles!  They are the BEST!!!<//review>

My first 2 visits at Slo Smiles couldn't have gone better. Dr. Leopold, Tiz and Gena are very kind, thorough and caring. My visit was pain free and they ensured i was comfortable. Thank you so much and i look forward to continuing my dental care with you.

I had a great experience at slo smiles!  I don’t normally leave reviews but I loved how welcoming and nonjudgmental they are. I haven’t been to a dentist in forever and needed some emergency work done, not only did they get me in but they where kind, quick and precise. What more can ya ask for?
Dr Craig and Sabrina are awesome, felt like I was hanging out with my friends🤙🏼<//Text>

I am among the world’s worst dental patients and in addition to doing excellent work, they go out of their way to make sure that your visit is comfortable and successful.

Our family has been the happy recipient of a lot of great service and support for about 20 years.  We've been happy with the good relationship beginning in the front office people like Lynn, Kate, Kathy and others who are always friendly and accomodating . Dr. Nick Murphy has lead us through the usual care plus false teeth and other more complicated issues that arose throughout the years. His work is excellent and he is someone who we completely trust to guide and treat us.  For the last twelve yers we have recieved  routine maintance care from hygenist Maria Compton who does an excellent job and who I call the "lady with the gentle hands".  We could not be happier with relationship and recommend them to anyone who is looking for reliable, capable and friendly care.  Jim Clark and Family.</Text>

<review>Excellence in dental care from start to finish.  Very professional and well run office.  Staff very efficient, responsive and friendly.  Dr. Ian Leopold has a wonderful bedside manner and is very skillful.  He explains everything very well and takes time to really listen to his patients. I just had two amalgam fillings removed and replaced with composite.  It was the most pleasant experience I've had at a dental practice.  I highly recommend this dental office.<//review>< pictures>

New to SLO smiles, but am very happy with everything, from the friendly and efficient office staff to the Doc and assistants.

From day one just on the phone with the staff, I knew I was in good hands. EVERYONE is so kind, patient and helpful. I needed some extra work done and they made me feel so comfortable, I didn't feel scared or anxious at all. My R.D.H Michele, was so easy to talk to, so gentle and so patient with me. I love her!

<Review>Back in 2010, I was 19 years old and broke my two front teeth almost in half. I was devastated. My smile had always been one of my favorite traits and I was utterly terrified that I needed crowns.

Dr. Ian Leopold was patient and empathetic throughout the entire process. He understood my anxiety and assured me that the final results would be great. Dr. Ian Leopold completed each step with exceptional skill, including creating temporary caps and administering numbing shots (nothing like watching a needle go into your gums). He ensured that that the final fit was perfect and that my teeth looked natural.

What prompted me to write this post, is that even ten years later—my crowns still are perfect. No chipping, discoloration, or irritation. My teeth look completely natural and no one knows that I have crowns unless I tell them. I have gone to numerous dentists over the years and even they don’t know that I have crowns until they see an x-ray or do an exam. I purposely don’t tell dentists beforehand, just to see their reaction as they exclaim at the skill that took to complete such excellent teeth. If you need crowns, I highly HIGHLY recommend going to SLO Smiles!<//Review>< rate>

<Text>Dr. Ian Leopold is my dentist and Michele Early is my dental hygienist. I have good teeth so it's just been checkups with Dr. Leopold. He is a true professional and really takes the time to get to know you and everything about your dental history and goals for your teeth. I've had more experience with Michele. It is hard to imagine how anyone could be more thorough or care more deeply about cleaning teeth. Her passion for her work is amazing and the end product is sparkling clean teeth and healthy gums.< /Text>< UserId.>

< review>
I can not say enough good things about Dr Ian Leopold and every person I have come in contact with in his office. I am that person that has struggled with a lot of anxiety about going to the dentist since I was a child. A couple years ago when my daughter chipped her tooth I called around looking to get her in right away to get it fixed. Hands down SLO Smiles was the friendliest and easiest to work with. After meeting Ian and watching him work on my daughter I was so impressed. After years of not going because of my fears, I thought I would give it a try.  From the girls at the front desk to the hygienist ( Robyn/Michelle) to the clinical team ( Gena) and of course Ian, everyone made me feel so at ease. I also must say the work my daughter and myself have had done has been flawless and quality work. Not to mention painless. I never thought I would be able to overcome my fears about the dentist, I am truly grateful to SLO Smiles for making this happen for me. For anyone who is thinking its been to long and they should give it a try I highly recommend going to SLO Smiles. I could give a hundred more reasons to go, but the most important reason is that your smile is worth it. :) Thank you SLO Smiles!< /review>

I had a small cavity filled today by Dr. Ian Leopold.  Since I have had many fillings over the years, I can easily compare experiences.  This one was pain free! And, it seemed like I was only there for minutes.  Dr. Leopold explained the steps and was extremely easy on my mouth.  Besides that, the staff is always so prompt, professional and friendly.  I am really impressed with the cleanliness of the office and the updated equipment as well.  Thank you everyone at SLO Smiles for showing me how it should be done.  You are truly top notch.</Text>

<Text>I just had my first cavity filling experience with SLO Smiles and Dr. Main.
It was so quick, easy, and PAINLESS. This office is the best. From front office staff, to hygienists, to the dentists. They are all fantastic. I highly recommend this office!!</Text><UserId.>102459610204260108254<//UserId.></record>

I love SLO Smiles! Just had some fillings taken care of and it couldn’t have gone better! I was amazed with how efficient Dr. Main was. I felt zero pain throughout the procedure. Even the Novocain. Hardly noticed it. Dr. Main and his staff are kind, friendly, and true professionals.  Thank you SLO Smiles for another great experience.< /review>

The entire team at SLO Smiles is terrific.  I have been a patient in their practice for many years.  The office has state of the art equipment, excellent dentists and hygienists, and the kindest staff!  I have had a good amount of dental work done, and I know I can always count on the entire team to take the time to explain procedures and carefully and thoughtfully work on me.  They are simply the best!<//text>

<review>First of all, I was warmly welcomed to SLO Smiles by Robin, making me feel at ease right away on my first day. My wife Mary recommended SLO Smiles since I was looking for a highly skilled dentist. I was definitely impressed with Dr. Ian Leopold from my first day on, and felt that I was going to be treated by a highly skilled and kind dentist. He would always explain each procedure or particular actions before actually doing them,
which is always comforting to hear. Many difficult procedures have been skillfully completed, such as bone graftings prior to implants, etc. Support staff and dental hygienist Maria have also been helpful and superb in their particular fields of endeavor, including receptionists doing their billing and appointments. All in all I have grown quite fond of everyone at SLO Smiles..they are a wonderful bunch of people. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone in need of expertise in dentistry.< /review>< Pictures>

I have been to several dentists over the years, and Dr. Murphy, Main & Leopold are the BEST dentistry group I have had the pleasure to use!  Their front office staff is polite, efficient & friendly. The back office staff was also wonderful!  They were friendly, fun, &excellent at their jobs. The dentists are top notch, with state of the art equipment, and appointments that run right on time.  They have enough dentists to cover each other and are small enough to be just the right size!   I would highly recommend this group!< /Review>

<review>SLO Smiles will leave you smiling when you leave! Everyone’s so friendly, from the front desk to the dentist. They are excellent at communicating. When my hygienist left, I received an email letting me know, which was so much nicer than just showing up to find someone new. Dr Ian is excellent!

<Review>As a college student I was reluctant to find another dentist away from home, but the experience I had at slo smiles was so pleasant. It was easy to get an appointment with Dr. Ian Leopold, and all of the staff is extremely knowledgeable and kind. They all make an effort to ensure you understand what is happening every step of the way and are comfortable. Dr. Leopold even called me personally after I had a cavity filled to ensure everything has settled well and I had no issues. I will definitely be going back.</Review>< pics>

Oh, I felt like I received good dental care in Hawaii, but as dental problems progressed, and dental accidents occurred; I, luckily returned to SLO, and the care of SLO Smiles.  Television commercials touting the advancements in dental prosthesis, so I pressed for information.  To my luck, Ian Leopold, DDS, had joined SLO Smiles.  My long time dentist, who was running out of filling material, agreed that implants would suit me best.  Dr. Leopold was the ultimate professional, who has an acute sense of attention to detail and preciseness; which, once you appreciate the mechanics and process, is manifest in his skills.< /Review>< Pictures>

After some difficulty with an implant, I decided to do my research and try the best dentist I could find. I found SLO Smiles and after a few visits, I found that all of the reviews I had read were completely accurate. They are very professional, courteous and administer quality dentistry. I would recommend SLO Smiles (specifically Ian Leopold who is my dentist) to anyone who is interested in the best dental care available.< /text>

Dr. Ian is easily the best dentist I have ever had.  He is easy to talk to, friendly, thorough, and he does really excellent work. Also, the hygienists are very nice and the office is beautiful (!), which actually makes going to the dentist enjoyable.  I prefer Dr. Ian so much that, despite living in southern California, I schedule my dentist appointments for my trips up to SLO. Highly recommended!</text>

This place is the best I’ve found in the SLO area. I’ve spent my fair share of time in a dentist chair due to my genes, I can speak from experience. Wonderful staff and the most lovely hygienist, she sings while she works, as I’m a music therapist I find this a delightful gift. The office overall makes obvious steps to educate their patients to have the right habits and ultimately need them less.</text>

<Review>I was previously treated by a local dentist who, in my opinion did extensive dental work on me (I had 4 root canals finished by this dentist and went there for a total of about 2.5 years). After two of the teeth repairs failed (one within a few months and the other just 1.5 years later) I was concerned. When the second tooth failed he didn't even provide all of the options to me, I had to ask about an implant. His plan was to pull the tooth that day and make a bridge. After pushing for an implant, he sent me to an oral surgeon and stated it could possibly all be done in one day. The appointment was scheduled for one week from then. My boss heard about this and recommended Dr. Ian Leopold and I was squeezed in two days later for a consult. He took the time to explain everything to me and reasoning  behind each step. I am in the last phase of an implant and have had nothing but good experiences along the way. I then had a second opinion/consult with him about my other teeth and he found some things that  were not even told to me from the previous dentist who I had just saw two months earlier. I will never go anywhere else for dental care and have complete trust in Dr. Ian Leopold. I do not think he just does things to make money but does what he thinks is the best decision and will discuss options with you every step of the way. His assistants and the staff are just as great always being accommodating and keeping tabs on things for me. I highly recommend this office.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<username>Ray< /username><text>After being a patient of Dr. Ian Leopold for the past four years I can say he is the best dentist I have ever had.
Recently I had a consultation with Dr. Leopold for complex dental issues involving bone loss and gum recession. I was wowed by the depth and currency of Dr. Leopold’s knowledge. This is a dentist who is totally committed to being at the top of his game. And, with his modern office he has access to the latest in dental technology.
Dr. Leopold’s expert knowledge comes packaged in a kind and patient personality. I never feel rushed. I get all my questions answered. And I can tell that Doctor Leopold is committed to giving me the best care possible. His staff----from Cambria, my dental hygienist, to the receptionists---is always friendly and attentive.
It doesn’t get better than this.< /text><gmapID>0x80ecf1002467c5b7:0x387d531d90a42ce0< /gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

<review>I’m a new patient at SLO Smiles. I’ve had two visits, so far.
One for evaluation (X rays, etc.) and a follow-up for cleaning.
I think I’ll be very satisfied with my new dental office and treatment. I now realize how “old fashioned” my former dentist was.
The SLO Smiles staff is friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and skilled.
The equipment and techniques are up to date.
There is no “ hard sell” of cosmetic treatments I don’t want.
(I stated from the start that my objective is healthy teeth and gums, not aesthetically perfect teeth.)
If I’d had a dentist experience like this much sooner, I would have a healthier mouth now.
I gladly recommend SLO Smiles, based on my experience so far.< /review><Date>1520100722272</Date>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This is a wonderful dental practice that deserves more than five stars. I've been seeing Dr. Ian Leopold since I moved here in 2015 and I can honestly say it's the best dental experience I've ever had. I most recently had an implant procedure with Dr. Leopold, which is one of his specialties. He put me completely at ease, explained each step as he worked, and it was an incredibly easy, pain-free experience. He followed up with a phone call in the evening to make sure I was doing ok, something I really appreciated. It all went very smoothly. I'm also very happy with the hygiene team. I've seen Sa'Teckia Foster since 2015 as well. She's terrific, does a wonderful job  and is extremely patient with my more-than-challenging tartar issues. The office itself is a pleasure to be in, with fresh flowers in the waiting room, and a lovely relaxing atmosphere, along with the latest high-tech dental equipment and an extremely personable staff.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I ended up working with Dr. Maine, assisted by Jaime.  My experience was beyond my expectations in every way.  I had 2 issues he dealt with.  The first one was a cavity below the gum line in the last molar, which is a very difficult place to anesthetize.  Dr. Maine allowed about 1/2 hour for this area to become numb, something other dentists in the past have not allowed.  The procedure was not only pain free, but I felt total relaxation the whole time.  My second problem seemed hopeless to me, and I had been to other dentists who had not been able to solve the issue... I had a severe accident 45 years ago which left me without front teeth... followed by a number of dental procedures which resulted in scar tissue and a tiny gap between the remaining teeth that was too small for a denture to fit.  I had been living without any front teeth and smiling very carefully, with my lips only, so no one would be aware that I was toothless for a number of years.  Dr. Maine worked with the lab and a creative solution was hatched to give me the look of normal front teeth in a removable denture.  Other dentists had tried and failed to resolve my issue.  The solution surpassed my wildest expectations!  For the first time in 7 years I can now smile... and even my closest family members did not even realize my new denture was not my own teeth.  Amazingly, when I smiled at them they just thought I was happier than they had seen me in years.  What a wonder!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I called Leopold, Murphy & Main (per a family member's strong recommendation) as soon as I returned home and they got me in immediately to discuss (and implement) an action plan.

As always, my hygiene appointment with Maria was great.  She is gentle, thorough, and just plain delightful.  Dr. Ian popped in to check on the progress of an extraction he had painlessly done previously.  Gena was able to squeeze me in unexpectedly to make an adjustment for a better fit on a partial.

The office of this doctor has been unprofessional and downright rude. My son broke a tooth during the night and was in pain and seeking an appointment to fix it.

He was told "we need to talk to the doctor to determine weather
we are willing to treat you". As justification they said that he refused to take X-Rays the previous time, as he had recently taken them (few weeks prior) by his home doctor (and x-rays were being provided from previous doctor)

All of this, in the face of a 19 yrs old guy, who had a broken tooth and in pain.<//text>

I have been a patient of Dr Mark Leopold for the past 10 years and I wouldn't go anywhere else!  He always explains what he sees and what he's doing while treating a dental problem.  There are several hygienists to choose from, but I always see Tami. My teeth feel fantastic when she's done with them! The office is beautiful and calm and they have all the latest technology.  I highly recommend this dental office to anyone looking for a new dentist.<//review>

These folks know their stuff and actually want to be the best.  My take on the business is that Mark, Nick, and the other owners demand excellence from their staff and the work atmosphere allows people to deliver their best. It seems as though everyone is accountable to one another in making the patient's experience their #1 priority.  From making the initial appointment...to the check-in...to the procedure and follow-up...these guys and gals have it down.  No, this isn't a fake plug...my wife and I have gone to them since the early 1980's when these boys built the building themselves. Quite a story!  Thanks to Mark, Nick, and all of you who make this place "one of a kind!"< /Review>

This place is great! Dr. Nick has been my dentist since I was a kid and I’ve never felt like I needed to go anywhere else. It’s because of this place that my teeth are in such great shape. The people here are always super friendly, and if I ever have any questions Dr. Nick and the hygienists have always taken the time to explain to me what’s going on with my teeth. I have been seeing Tecki as my hygienist for the last couple years and I couldn’t be happier. She always makes my cleanings a breeze, and took the time to show me how to properly brush and floss. She also introduced me to the water pick, and now I can’t go without it. I know I said it before, but this place is great! I absolutely recommend SLO Smiles.<//Text>

I am so pleased with the new smile Dr. Mark Leopold just completed for me.  He has given me the confidence and ability to smile with glee after my recent dental work.  Dr. Mark, Kim, and the entire staff were so supportive, caring, and always concerned about my well being.  Dr. Mark is careful, considerate, and an expert in his field.  I would recommend Leopold, Murphy and Main DDS to everyone for all your hygiene and dental needs.</text>

<review>Dr. Main is the best. I had a root canal by an Endodontist while Dr Main was on vacation.  The endodontist said I would need a new crown.  Dr. Main called me when he got back from vacation and assured me that I probably wouldn’t need a crown, but if I did, I would not have be charged since Dr. Main had just put a crown in the tooth Dec., 2018.  Dr. Main is gentle, informative, and I recommend him highly.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

I went in concerned about possible serious gum problems and Mark Leopold carefully examined me, took photos of my gums so I could see what he was seeing, and fully explained my problem, and his recommended solution.  He and his partners and staff always seem to have the the latest technology and knowledge and are willing to explain what they see completely.  I've been a patient here for 27 years.< /Review>

I have been cared for by the dentists at SLO smiles for over 30 years. It is a very nice place for your oral health.  A few years ago I had an accident and my front teeth were either loose or knocked out. The care I received was wonderful and competent. My teeth are beautiful once again. I also get my cleaning done here, the hygenist found a problem that didn’t show up on the x-rays. Top notch place to go!<//text>

I love going to the dentist at SLO Smiles because the staff and atmosphere is amazing. Every time I leave I can’t stop smiling because of how clean and shiny my teeth look. My past appointment I had the lovely Teckie and she has been my favorite hygienist by far. She made me feel super comfortable and was very funny. I definitely recommend her and SLO Smiles no matter what!</Text>

SLO Smiles has changed my life. I have been deathly afraid to go to the dentist for over 20 years. I only went when I was in severe pain. Not anymore! Dr. Murphy put me at ease on my first visit and I've been back every 6 months since. He works quickly, yet is very thorough. I'm always surprised by how fast my appointments go. I know I won't ever have any more issues with my teeth with Dr. Murphy!  EVERYONE in the office is so friendly. Cambria, my hygienist, is the best! She gets me in and out for my cleanings with ease. I actually look forward to my appointments now because of the professionals in this office. I can't say enough good things about this practice. They are hands down the best dental practice around.< /text>

Dr. Main and his team are kind, courteous, professional and capable. The front office staff is pleasant and helpful. My insurance claims are processed quickly and correctly. This office uses new technology and the staff members pride themselves on their training and up-to-date equipment (such as a new machine that creates your crown right there in the office, eliminating the need for multiple appointments). I can honestly say that over the years my dental health has improved greatly, and I credit Leopold, Murphy and Main.<//text>

<review>I have been a patient of Dr. Murphy’s for 14 years and have never been happier. He is incredibly knowledgeable and warm and is always concerned with my comfort.  I have a problematic mouth with only one tooth without a crown. Dr. Murphy has put in new crowns, replaced old crowns, and added bridges when necessary. Without his expertise, I doubt that I would still have my own teeth.

His staff is top notch from the front desk to the hygienists to the assistants. I personally use Maria as my hygienist and could not be happier.

I can not  recommend SLO Smiles more highly. They make a trip to the dentist stress free for me.

Just went there a few days ago. I had such a wonderful experience. Extremely professional and curious. Everything moved very smoothly, from setting up my initial appointment, to finding my insurance coverage, to explaining my treatment plan and setting up future appointments. They took multiple x-rays first. Highly recommended.<//text>

My husband and I found that staff had incredible knowledge, competence, listening skills, and so much more. The thoroughness of our visit was excellent for multiple reasons. Great listing skills and responses; depth of technical knowledge on most all topics covered was top notch. We felt comfortable and not hurried in the least even though we took quite a bit of time asking many questions toward arriving at a comprehensive treatment plan. We engaged in a high level discourse and gained a much better understanding of all aspects of how to proceed. We met Gena who is completely competent beyond anyone we experienced before--the depth and breadth of her knowledge was outstanding; Ian who did an excellent evaluation, had amazingly steady hands and gentle manner, and soothing presence; and Mark who stopped in to discuss general protection and detoxification after overhearing our conversations with Gena and Ian. We felt we received, and in the future would receive, very competent dental care. We want to thank everyone for a great experience.</Text>

<Text>Our entire family goes to Leopold, Murphy & Main - and recently, that's been a lot. My dad and sister needed new crowns, my husband had 4 implants, and luckily, I got off the hook with a simple cleaning. In addition to an easy to get to location, with a beautiful building, including bird feeders outside the windows, the hygienists are so friendly, and my dentists Mark and Ian are great about explaining what's going on with my teeth, in any easy to understand manner. I still can't say that "I love going to the dentist", though from reservation to follow-up, the team at LM&M makes it really pleasant, whether for a check-up, or major work. Thanks!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to Leopold Murphy and Main since 2007...ever since I was referred to them by another local dental practitioner and several friends. I was in need of restorative/cosmetic work due to a long family history of poor dental health. I was in my 50s.  I was directed to see Dr. Mark Leopold. He and his work are awesome!  He is a perfectionist and a very caring practitioner. After he semi-retired and became a specialist I switched over to his son Ian. Ian is every bit as focused on quality and kindness as his Dad. I actually enjoy dental visits (I feared them as a kid)...and it is because of this practice and staff...they are all long term employees and everyone has a GREAT attitude. They work as a team and strive for excellence. I have been to several dental practices on the Central Coast and I truly believe this is the best of the best!</review>

<text>8:30 Saturday morning I was eating cereal when I realized I had broken a tooth that had a root canal done and was capped. I called SLOSmiles and was given an appointment for 11:30. When I arrived I was greeted by name and was soon in the chair being assessed by Izabel and Dr. Ian. In less than an hour my tooth had been repaired and a treatment plan initiated for a more permanent fix. Everyone was very professional and genuinely caring.

<text>I've never been to a dentist that is as considerate of the patient's experience as Dr. Murphy and the staff at SLO Smiles. I highly recommend SLO smiles if you usually dread going to the dentist; Dr. Murphy will go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable, and will avoid painful procedures at all costs. I just had two cavities filled in under 20 minutes, no numbing needed, no pain what-so-ever!<//text><Rating>5< /Rating><userid>110063112392547465487</userid><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

<Review>Leopold, Murphy and Main provides excellent customer service all the way through, from their front desk crew, to the hygienists and the dentists themselves. It's always a pleasure to go to the dentist at this office! Thank you for being such a personal, friendly, fun staff to be around. Specifically Maria and Dr. Main make the experience fun and personal every time!< /Review><userid>101600812977279441126<//userid></record>

<review>I called in with what I considered an emergency, a broken front crown, and they were able to see me within 24 hours.  When I arrived, I was able to be seen before my appointment time, so the dental assistant could get the full story of what exactly happened. She was very polite, listened well and gave the dentist a full run down of my situation. When the dentist came to see me, he gave me plenty of options to rectify my tooth problem and there was no push for an up sell. I left the office with a good feeling and a brighter smile. Thanks you.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
Dr. Mark has been my dentist for a number of years. He practices in a proactive and caring manner. When I have had dental issues he has taken the lead in diagnosing and effectively treating the problems. Dr. Leopold is extremely meticulous and his surgical skills and follow up are excellent. He and all the doctors are very involved with continuing education, bringing the latest in science and medicine to his patients. I would strongly recommend the team at Leopold, Murphy and Main for any dentistry needs you may have from routine care to advanced dentistry. An excellent group dedicated to bringing the latest technology to their patients in a proactive and caring manner.</Review>

<text>I've been going to Dr Leopold and his hygienists for nearly 20 years. They are always friendly, competent, thorough, and willing to reschedule you in a timely manner whenever you need to change your scheduled appointment. I don't have insurance but it's worth it to me to go to a really good dentist on a regular basis to keep my mouth healthy.< /text>< username>

I would have to say, that My experience couldn't be any better!...Dr.Leopold has been my dentist for over 15yrs. To date?..It has been Great! Throughout the years to watch His Practice Grow! Into the new newly remodeled office building that would allow more patients to receive treatments.The  "Team" of Doctors and supporting staff are the Best!!
Personally,I have had very extensive prosthetic and perio treatments by Dr.Leopold that have given me the Best reason To "SMILE" And thankfully To (Michele) My Great! Hygienist!....That helps Me to Keep! It up? Thanks!...J2 😎< /Review>

The service and care that each and everyone gives at Leopold, Murphy & Main is exceptional! From the moment you walk in and Lynn & the receptionists greet you with smiles to Maria cleaning your teeth, to Edy assisting Dr. Murphy listening to every concern and question, to checking out and getting your next appointment. In addition to the great care they also have the latest technology that ensures your smile is the best. All this while visiting the dentist...< /text>

<Review>I recently relocated to SLO County and was pretty nervous about finding a new dentist. I left a great one behind when I moved, and had also begun the process of getting dental implants (after a bridge broke two months before our relocation - worst timing ever!) After stopping by several different dental offices in SLO, Templeton and Atascadero, I still hadn't found one that felt right -- until I walked into SLO Smiles. To be honest, I'd been put off by the cutesy name, but there is nothing frivolous about this practice. They spent plenty of time showing me around, introducing staff, and answering all my questions about the practice, the dentists' education and expertise, and the cost of the procedures required to complete my dental repairs. Since then I've had a comprehensive exam with Dr. Ian Loepold, who impressed me with his confident perfectionism, thoroughness, and the state-of-the-art equipment in his arsenal. I also had a first cleaning with Lissa, and she couldn't have been more gentle or more thorough. I'm left feeling extremely confident about my remaining implant work, and so grateful to have found a friendly, convenient, and proficient dental practice in my new home.< /Review>< pictures>

I first walked in to this office in 2011. What I found was an honest and caring staff. I wasn't fully aware of the sub-par dental experience I've had for the few years before that. They worked with me and my financial situation to find the payment plan that i could afford. And the service I received never suffered for it. Ian Leopold is friendly, professional, and good at what he does. My mouth is healthier and it's only going to get better thanks to the information and care this office has provided me. Thank you.</Text>

Dr. Ian Leopold very recently placed Novadontic dental implants and I couldn’t be happier with the results!

My experience was very positive.  I  did not have a long wait  in the reception area.

I use a walker and the the the examination room was easy to manipulate.  Dr. Murphy was very frank about what concerns he has and gave me a simple explanation of and what needs to be done to solve the problem.

<Text>I'm a student at Cal Poly here in slo and I had a filling fall out so I called and spoke with Robyn the receptionist and she was extremely friendly and willing to help. Dr. Murphy saw me the same morning I called and my entire experience was amazing. I was in no pain at all and the numbing medication was also injected painlessly. I am now switching from going to my dentist at home during school breaks to coming here during the year.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I have several cleanings, a filling and a crown.  Dr. Leopold is a very skilled professional.  The crown was prepared and finished in one visit.  I highly recommend anyone looking for dental treatment to try this office.  You will never go elsewhere.< /review>< name>

<Date>1425444094576<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>My first interaction with Dr. Mark Leopold occurred during a weekend dental emergency. One of my top front teeth(crown) broke off on a Saturday one day before I was to fly to Atlanta for a business meeting with a new client. Being new to town and not knowing any dentists, I was in a complete panic. I called multiple dental offices and of course got voicemail for every one of them. Luckily for me, Dr. Leopold returned my voicemail within a few minutes and agreed to meet me at his office within the hour. He patched up my tooth so I was presentable for my Atlanta trip - that was seven years ago and I continue to receive the best dental care I have ever experienced on every single visit. His staff is awesome - everyone from the front office, the dental assistants, and hygenists are professional, courteous, and friendly, making each visit as pleasant as possible. The quality of dental care has been exceptional - I have had extensive crown work done over the years, and I am extremely satisfied with the results. You will not find a better dentist, or dental office on the Central Coast.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I had put off a procedure for years because of my fear. My questions were answered thoroughly (I wanted to know 'worst case scenario'). Ian had recommended this treatment years ago but only in the last 6 months with tooth pain did I realize it was time. My nerves were jumpy - and I opted for nitrous oxide during the procedure which helped greatly. My jaw was barely sore and my teeth didn't hurt at all when it was completed. I've been going there for regular cleanings for about 6 years - always professional there.</text>

Both the dr and the dental hygienist were very abrupt and rude. I am nervous about going to a dentist and they made my experience a nightmare
Dr Main sent me home because he was preparing me for a crown which caused me to gag.
I went back the second time and they were still rude and abrupt. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.</text>

My first visit to SLO Smiles was awesome! Everyone was so nice and  I felt like I was  treated as family. Jaime got me all prepped for my X-rays and we were just chatting away the whole time. Dr. Main came in and looked at the X-rays and explained in detail, and most importantly, in laymen’s terms, about what was needed to get my teeth back in shape! We had a great conversation about motorcycles and other passions. He never once gave the impression that he was in a hurry to get out of there while just chatting away with me...awesome doc😎! I never had the feeling like being on an assembly line, and the “wham bam thank you ma’am” attitude that I experienced at my previous dental office! So happy to have found SLO Smiles and looking forward to a long relationship with them...5 stars plus😀!<//Review>

It was very comforting to know when I called Dr. Murphy's office, even though they were closed, the answering machine had a way where you could contact your dentist if you had a concern. I was in no pain, so left a message I would like to be seen on Monday to fix the tooth. Early Monday morning I got a call and Dr. Murphy squeezed me in between patients and in 20 minutes I was good as new. I knew the dental work would be excellent and pain free, but the most comforting thing was knowing that if I had been in pain over the weekend, I would be able to get my dentist's help as needed. That is true service. Thanks, Dr. Murphy< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Ian Leopold is awesome!  He is super friendly and extremely skilled and knowledgable!  I had a natural defect in my front tooth that was deep and stained and he fixed perfectly in under 15 minutes!  I literally can't even tell where the defect used to be--he filled and matched the filling material so perfectly!  He was very thorough and took the time to explain my x-rays to me and answer any questions I had.  He wasn't too aggressive with recommending treatment but made sure to note all my potential problem areas and potential cavities.  I will go back to him for all of my dental work and I recommend him to all my family and friends.  You literally won't meet a more competent or friendly dentist in SLO!  Also, their office is incredibly beautiful and comfortable--unlike any dental office I have ever been too!  If you want a great dentist go to Dr. Ian Leopold!<//Text>

These guys are great! I was in yesterday for a hygiene appointment and X-rays. My hygienist Tieke was very thorough and gentle. Dr. Mark and Dr. Ian even took time to come over and talk to me about a few potential treatment options for some work I will need done. This is a great office, clean, friendly and knowledgable. I would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

I went to Dr. Main because I had some pain on my last molar teeth. When I got to the office everybody was friendly and concern about my pain. I got an xray done and Dr. Main come to the room. He check for any fillings, if it was broken but everything look good. He then do a treatment because he notices it was very sensible to the air and water. And after, I got home the pain was gone. I am so happy to have such a wonderful dentist that cares about my dental help. Thank you Dr. Main!< /Text>

< Review>
Going to the dentist, probably like many others, is not my favorite pastime. This visit was just for cleaning. While I have a difficult time with gagging and swallowing, my hygienist (Teckkie - not sure of spelling) was very patient with me and made sure I was doing OK before proceeding. I really appreciated her care.<//Review>

< review>
I've been going to Dr. Murphy since 1991 and I trust him completely.  Every visit is made enjoyable not only by Dr. Murphy, but by the friendly staff.  From the moment I walk in I'm treated like an old friend by everyone, from the girls at the front desk, the dental assistants, the hygienists, and all the staff.

They take time to answer my questions, help me make decisions, and never have I felt rushed or ignored with my concerns.  They always make sure that all my needs are met.

Before going to this office, I was very afraid of dentists and dreaded going for my checkups, but not anymore.

I want to thank everyone at the office of Leopold, Murphy and Main, for taking care of my dental needs.< /review>

<Review>I have been to many dental practices throughout my life, and hands-down love Leopold, Murphy and Main the best!  I lost an 18-year-old cap while driving by the high school in San Luis Obispo at 5:15pm on a Friday.  I called and left a message since it was after hours.  First thing Saturday morning the office returned my call and Dr. Ian Leopold took care of me THAT DAY!  I have had a few cleanings, fillings and exams as well, and they have all been amazing.  I'm still not a fan of visiting the dentist (who is?), but I definitely don't dread it as much as I used to!</Review>< user_name>

< Review>
I'm very appreciative of how professional, caring and compassionate the staff of LM&M are, from entry through the front door to settling accounts and walking out. I'm 71 now and I've never had a dentist's office treat me so well.<//Review>

If you're nervous about getting dental work, I understand. I was really nervous too. Thankfully, you can rest assured that you're in good hands at SLO Smiles. If you're scared, Sarah will take the time to call in a sedative to your pharmacist or ensure there will be nitrous oxide available for your appointment. If you then take this nitrious oxide and accidentally deflect Dr. Leopold's hand while he tries to inject novocaine in your mouth he'll be super patient with you. And if his hand happens to get pricked with that needle causing a massive hematoma, he'll still be really nice to you. He'll even follow up with you the next day to see if you're okay, even though he suffered more than you. Highly recommend!< /text>

I have been going to Slo Smiles for about 8 years now and my teeth and gums have never been so healthy. They are always on time, the staff is great. I constantly see the same hygienist and Dr, not like other offices where you never know who will see you for that visit. I highly recommend this office. Great work and most important, consistency. They even helped me undertand that straight teeth is not just for looks, it influeneces my gum health too. I had invisalign done here and my gums are my healthier now, easier to floss.< /review>

This dental office is the best in the county - they will take care of you from scheduling an office visit to a follow-up call to make sure everything is o.k. I can't say enough good things about the staff, and the great dentist, easy parking.  You will be happy with this choice.<//text>

I went in for a dental cleaning July, 2017,  at Leopold Murphy and Main ( now SLO smiles) where  I met the hygienist, Robin B. She was very,  kind and explaiedn every procedure she was about to do! During my initial treatment it was suggested that I purchase and use a waterpik. I didn't believe in waterpiks and thought they were a waste of money but I thought that I would try it anyway. Robin B also gave me a plan to follow for better care of my gums. I followed the treatment plan and just left the office today ( Nov. 30th) and I must say we were both amazed! Where  I previously had 36 "bad spots",  that number had been reduced down to one. Previously,  I had beat leading gums when I flossed (Yuck) and today, one small spot! These results were amazing! Robin B is an amazing, empathetic hygienists who knows her job! She said I can come back and in 6 months instead of 3 because of the healing that has occured! Thanks to her plan, my gums are healthier and my smile is brighter! Thank you Robin B!</review>

I was so pleased with the work Dr Ian and Izabel did on an upper molar. I had some alternative treatment as dictated by "The Right Dental Choice" by Dr. Marshall and Dr. Aguilera. Dr Ian followed the protocol for my zirconium crown. He ordered the preferred cement just for me. I wanted him to use new dental burrs, he did. I wanted laser disinfection before the temporary and before the final crown which he also did. He used septocaine as I requested. I had a bad reaction after the anesthesia wore off after the 1st appointment. So we used half the normal amount for the 2nd and last appointment - and I had no bad reaction. Izabel set the temporary crown perfectly and Ian set the final crown perfectly. I am so happy with my new tooth. During the procedures, Ian calmed me by telling me what he was doing.< /text>

I am an 83 year old man who had a tooth break off, fortunately just above the gum line. Dr. Leopold removed the root a week ago and I have yet to take a pain-killer or experience the least discomfort.  I just hope I can figure out how to post this review...< /Text>

Be wary folks, Just a big corp who will not work with you if you are unable to return equipment instantly, billing will continue Due to Covid I was unable to fly and assist my dying brother, he opted for hospice and unplugged the unit as it was calling all the time.  I tried to ask his cna’s to return the equipment without success.  I was finally am able to travel to assist my brother, during his last days.  Bay Medical runs your credit card, not for a final due, No their system is set to bill in each month separately, well my cc denied multiple similar charges from out of state like they do fraud cases.   Watch out the company systems are problematic, and will lock up your card, if it doesn’t process they will keep trying until your card is locked.  Pay only with a check.< /Text>

My mother loves Bay Alarm. It gives her great confidence to have the main device as well as the lanyard around her neck. She's had several occasions to use the service to get help. Someone is always immediately on the line and EMS is sent right away.

I had an excellent customer service experience today ordering a lanyard to replace on the Mom lost. The rep took a lot of care to make sure the right product was ordered. I appreciated the call. My family needed a service we can depend on and Bay Alarm provides us with the confidence we need.< /Review>

Zack at Bay Alarm Medical was professional, knowledgeable and courteous! He took care of replacing my Mom’s missing medical alert necklace hassle-free! We have used Bay Alarm Medical for a while now and they are amazing. They are there when you need them most 24/7. The response time is quick! Thanks again Bay Alarm Medical!< /review>

<text>I did research before our family chose the Bay Alarm Medical system.  We chose Bay Alarm because of the impressive online  reviews and the fact that there were NO contracts to sign  We have Bay Alarm for almost 10 years to support mom's desire to live independently and safely.  She used the button several times over the year.  Each time, emergency assistance arrived quickly and I was promptly notified.< /text>< time>

<Time>1621270104761< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Prompt and efficient customer/technical service on a SUNDAY afternoon!  I was pleased and impressed that we were able to diagnose and resolve the battery issue with my Dad's GPS medical alert device.  Zach in technical service was a consummate professional from beginning to end and inquired about my Dad's well-being and then was patient as my sometimes cantankerous 90-year-old father insisted on telling the entire story.  Zack knew immediately that Dad's 2017 GPS device was a now-obsolete 3G network model and he quickly provided us the information to upgrade to a 5G network model for a modest one-time cost.   Bay Alarm Medical has been great to work with since I discovered them after my Mom's death in late 2017 which left Dad all alone out in the country.  So far, he remains healthy and independent but the house medical alert device and the GPS device have provided Dad and the rest of our immediate family the peace of mind of knowing Dad can get help anywhere, anytime and that we can keep a digital eye on Dad with text and email alerts.  Well done Team Bay Alarm Medical !!< /Review>< pics>

She was very clear on the process of exchanges and also helped on other non-billing questions.   What was super cool on that is that we didn't need to be transferred to another department.  Was one-stop shopping.   The boarding process of has been effortless from beginning to end so far.<//Review>< time>

The account is connected to my email address, but my mom's is paying it for her use. All I need to do is update her phone number on her profile and am not able to do that on the website. So far I've been on hold to speak to customer care for 40+ minutes to get this done. Responsive? Not even in the slightest. Helpful? I wish. So if they call the old number, it won't be her when she needs the help.</Review>

I talked to a lot of people and shopped around and chose Bay Alarm Medical. They've been rated as America's Number One Medical Alert Company. Their response time is phenomenal and their customer service is second to none! Their prices are also extremely reasonable too, which I can't say for a lot of these companies. I got the GPS unit, so it goes everywhere that I go, so I know that anytime I might need help, it's only a button push away!

<review>Fairly straightforward to hook up and use. Found that base does not need to be hooked up next to phone, can use jack in any room. Also when  RANGE testing, just press the button on the lanyard every 5 seconds or so, not continually. Other than that, we had no issues. Good product that gives us lots of peace knowing our family member is safely monitored. Good and quick response.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>
{'time': 1620146268120, 'text': "Hi Charissa - Thank you for your feedback and honest review. We advise when testing or even during an emergency to press the button only one time. It's best to press one time and the alarm will trigger on your base station and you will let the alarm continue as you would in an emergency. Once the live dispatcher connects over the base station 2-way speakers to check your status, simply let them know you are okay and just testing. We advise to do this test monthly.\n\nNow, if you are range testing, then yes, you will press every 5 seconds and listen for the beep. This is only to test the range distance between your button & the base station.\n\nIf you ever need help testing or range testing, we are always happy to help walk you through it and do a live test over the call with you. Your safety and comfort is our priority!\n\nBest regards,\nBay Alarm Medical"}<//resp>

Great price and great service. Had issues with call time due to a system error but they apologized and helped me very effectively. I would recommend them 100%. My dad used it for when my he was at work and my mom was alone, now that he has passed I use it to make sure my mom is taken care of because I can't be there.</Review>

<Review>Very well managed by the Bay Alarm representative.  He even answered questions I hadn't yet quite asked, assuring me above all that I should feel free to click on the alarm any time I'm in some distress.  My question was directed at my need only for someone to help me get on my feet after an unfortunate fall.  Above all, I don't wish to be whisked into an ambulance once I'm on my feet, but the representative assured me that I don't have to follow orders from those who come to help.

Excellent service, a genial voice on the other end.< /Review>< pictures>

We wanted to give my ma (and us!) a little peace of mind living on her own after a very scary medical emergency. Bay offers many options to fit any need (she doesn't have a landline or cable). Thankfully she has not had to use it in an emergency but when calling to shuffle her emergency contact numbers, changing her address, accidentally setting her wearable lanyard button off while opening a jar of pickles (good one, ma), and testing her unit monthly (don't forget to do it!), I/we have always gotten someone stateside very quickly and they've just been wonderful. She has her main unit, her wearable button, and a button in the bathroom, all for a VERY reasonable price. I was a little overwhelmed when first looking but the choice was pretty clear.

Great customer service. I didn’t want to wait on hold and asked for a call back which I got in 10 minutes. The rep was very helpful and answered my question and asked if I needed other assistance. Great experience!</text>

<text>We've been a customer of Bay Alarm Medical for a couple of years using a base system in my mother's home along with a mobile device for when she is out of the house.  Service has been excellent.  As she is moving soon to an independent living apartment I needed to look at best options.  The support team was very helpful in identifying what options are available and some good recommendations on how to proceed.  I really appreciated the professional and friendly assistance!<//text>< pics>

<text>I purchased the system for my elderly mother. The purchase process was good. Setting it up was easy enough.  Would have given 5 stars, except my mother complains that it does not work the way she thought it would. The device that she wears around her neck is not a two-way device. So if she falls somewhere out of hearing range from the base unit, she cannot communicate with the operator.</text>< resp>

Just received and set up the system for my mom. SUPER easy set up. Basically a plug n play. Tested the equipment and it was simply amazing. They answered right away. Verified the address and confirmed the test worked as it should. I HIGHLY recommend this service if you or a lived one has the need for a medical alert system.</text>

Awesome emergency call service for seniors!! Can't count how many times this has helped my Mom when she falls. And their pricing is very reasonable. I've had to replace several bracelet alerts due to my Mom losing them and their customer service is the best, shipping out replacements quickly.

Highly recommended service for those with seniors who live on their own.</Text>

<review>Dianna (I hope I got the name correct, so please check to give credit to the right person) was AMAZING....the ultimate professional.  She handled our situation seamlessly....answering my questions on tech problems, fixing the billing issue and following up with me regarding the tech problems she fixed on site with my Mom and her caretaker.  I cannot say enough about her competence and excellent customer service abilities.  10+ rating....service above and beyond.< /review>< pictures>

<user>115564200835840381504</user><Review>I called customer service today to see about getting a replacement band for my Mom's life alert.  She wears it 24/7 on her wrist and has had it for a while and it's dirty.  I thought it would not be a big deal to get a replacement band.  I was told the cost was $12.95 plus $12 for shipping.  Thankfully they are willing to waive the shipping.

The rep was very nice and helpful so I am happy with that.  Just not super happy that a small piece of rubber would cost so much for a loyal customer that's been there for several years.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< rating>

The service provided for my mother was excellent. The alert necklace she wore was light and comfortable. I received notifications any time there was an internet/power outage. The value for the money is great. My only concern was for some reason they couldn't bill my card and I didn't find out for several months resulting in a large amount due. Other than that, very pleased and would recommend.<//review>

<text>I just initiated service with Bay Alarm Medical and am already thoroughly impressed with this company. I am managing my brother's late-stage ALS from 1200 miles away and needed a medical alert provider that I feel comfortable working with and that understands the nuances of his unusual situation living alone.  Philips Lifeline, the previous provider, never told me that its 5G based system was not compatible with my brother's 4G based wireless phone.  This caused a lot of problems and forced me to find another company.  So far I'm relieved to have found Bay Alarm Medical.</text>< Pics>

If he did not know the answer, he made sure that he immediately found the information I requested and then conveyed it, making certain that I understood.

Thank you Bay Alarm for a most reassuring conversation with Zack.

They were very professional, patience and answered all my
questions about changing a few things for our Mom's setup.

They were also understanding that I wasn't changing
anything I was just getting some answers to make
some informed decisions and nothing was pushed
on me to use.

Very nice and helpful to work with.</Text>

I can't say enough good things. They really do offer a 30 day money back guarantee so don't be afraid to try.  My mother wasnt happy when I first got this for her so I sent it all back.  A few months later she fell and wished she had it. Now we have the in home monitor and the mobile GPS on the go. When she goes out on the activity bus for her residence she can still reach me or get help if she needs to without the hassle of a cell phone. No technical or cognitive skills needed, it is just a push button. The people at Bay Medical are always so nice when I call with a question and they speak very well with my mother when there is an alert. A must have to keep older parents in their home and safe.</text>

Apparently I need to exchange my mother's fall alert lanyard with an updated one. The technician on the phone was so very helpful. He even sent me pictures of the lanyard because my mother typically just wears her wrist alarm watch and she wasn't even using the lanyard. Now that she has become less mobile and relying more on her walker, I'm going to make sure that she wears her lanyard consistently during the day. I've only needed to contact the company a few times and each time I do they are very helpful.</Review>< resp>

<text>Setting up was generally easy.  I had to call to ask a couple of questions on the same topic: is the watch waterproof (for a shower), and is the 'fall' monitor waterproof -- also for the shower.  The answers were both 'yes', which is fine.  Only the instructions were missing the information.</text></record>

I called to have my grandmother's life alert fixed, and I spoke with Naveed. He was super helpful and patient with me. My grandmother's house is old and the telephone and internet lines are an addition to the house as technology evolved. He was super understanding, patient and helpful. I truly appreciate his dedication and he was able to resolve the issue. It turns out that my grandmother's landline wire no longer liked the wall it was attached too, and we moved it and that solved the issue.</Text>

Terrible customer service! It’s not the representative necessarily.  The company needs to work on there policies and procedures. They said they were sending the order UPS 2day which we paid an extra $40 for but they did not ship it for two days and they sent it USPS which caused a further delay. They send you an email asking for a review but they do not send you an email with a receipt after your purchase. They also need to add security questions so they know who they are talking to as they have no way to identify you.
I hope there equipment an response to an emergency are better than the policies and procedures.  They also need a page on there website to make it easier to read there reviews. I was not able to find a full list only a carousel you could click through and it was incomplete. Also they need to label the two phone numbers and route them so you can reach customer service instead of reaching sales after waiting for 10 minutes only to be transferred to customer service.<//text>

Received my new Bay Alarm Medical pendant alarm today. Was very easy to set up. As usual customer service was polite and professional when I called for reassurance and to test the alarm. I feel very comfortable and much more secure knowing BAM is there if I need them.  Only concern doesn't apply to me but does to new customers. The original package was shipped via USPS priority on April 14. Was supposed to arrive on April 19. Today is April 26 and USPS tracking is still showing it is expected to arrive "late" but in route to a facility. I had a 2nd package shipped by UPS 2 business days. Shipped last Thursday. Arrived today as promised. I am happy that I agreed to pay the extra shipping charges and have my alarm. Saving money on shipping and not having my security doesn't work. Paying extra to have it when I need it does work.< /Text>

Was helping my aunt after she had her purse stolen. And she does auto pay via cc. That was stolen also. I called and spoke with Jessica in Billing who couldn’t have been more delightful and helpful. She was professional and efficient so didn’t have to spend hours on the phone like with other companies. I highly recommend Bay Medical. I’ve used this company previously for my father until he passed away. Bay Medical is always there to help. Thanks again to Jessica today.< /text>

It was a pleasant experience dealing with your technical people. I dealt with an agent named Zoe. She was very polite and friendly. She answered all of my questions quickly and easily, and added additional information. I think I’m off to a good start! Thanks</Text>

<review>Very good tech support once they answered after holding on for 25 minutes.  Jocelyn walked us through set up/testing 5 buttons ( took awhile but worked) and included a call back each time to be sure we didn’t need help.  Hoping this replacement unit/set up will solve problems we had with first base unit .  Jocelyn was very patient abd gave clear instructions.</review>< Response>

<Text>Once they answered, the IT person was extremely helpful. I did have to wait more than an hour before someone answered when I called. We did not understand why there were two buttons. We thought the GPS button and fall button were just one button.The pamphlet on the Fall button didn't address the fact that you should not leave the button laying flat if you weren't wearing it.
Again the IT person was very helpful with our questions.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My Mom is 96 and still lives in her own home.  She fell a couple weeks ago and laid of the floor for about six hours.  We had purchased other similar devices but they really didn't last long and were not effective.   I purchased a unit and service from Bay Alarm Medical and this week, our family called Bay Alarm to assist us in getting everything set up and running.  We worked with "Asia" who could not have been more pleasant and helpful!  She is an asset to your company.  At the end of our extended conversation, Mom said that Asia deserved a raise.  Our family was very impressed with her and all other associates that we have had interactions with.....

<Text>My son purchased this plan for me. I live in an independent living setting in an apartment. it was trouble from day one .The co recorded my neighbor's phone instead of mine.. I am 433 and she is 422 so it is a typo....However, it took 29 phone calls and constant promises they had corrected the problem...BUT my neighbor received more than 20 calls resulting in complaints against me. They tried to tell me that
I am old so need help testing and that the battery is low. Terrible customer service that is only available during the day...n o night coverage.
This has cost me friends, time and my son has lost money and time from his job. They are very deceptive.

Because the person I care for has moved to Assisted Living Facility and no longer needs the monitor we are returning it.
The person I spoke with was very professional.  He gave me all the information I need to return Arlene's monitoring device and was very good at explaining the options available.
Please give him the highest rating!

This review is specifially for customer service over the phone because I have not used the actual service yet but have found customer service during setup to be amazingly good. Answer phone quickly, clear descriptions in answers to my questions and quickly passed me to a different department when my questions warranted it.  I have not used it so can't comment on the "in action" component yet.</Text>

We were showing her and the caregivers how to use the necklace for an emergency. We told her that if she fell, just press the button on her necklace and Mom (literally) thought I meant to do it right now. Well, right at that moment, she pressed the button and IMMEDIATELY a Bay Alarm Medical Representative spoke out on the intercom base asking if she was okay. OH MY, ABSOLUTELY IMPRESSIVE!!! We all grinned at Mom, thanked the Representative and told him that all is well, and that it was just an accidental call.

<Review>We used Bay for our elderly mother. The service was great. My mom would get very scared when someone was not with her and would activate the Bay alarm. Needless to say, most were not emergencies. But the Bay staff were always very patient and understanding and would follow the protocol to notify a family member. They never said a word about her "overusing" the service. The equipment performed flawlessly even when the power went out with storms and when the bombing in Nashville affected phone service throughout the state. Glad we chose Bay to help keep our mom safe.< /Review>< Date>

Best price/performance combination for Cellular/GPS fob.  No long-term contract

Accurate GPS location reporting.

Like the magnetic attachment on the charging unit.  Reasonable answer time during monthly tests.  Very nice operators in the call center!< /text>

<text>We love the small, lightweight device that is easy and comfortable to take with us.  The response times have been quick and consistent.  The audio volume and clarity are excellent.  The customer service  at the call center and for technical/account issues has been professional, friendly, and helpful.  This all makes for a comfortable, low-stress environment to rely on.  I am happy to recommend this product and company.
The Android app for Caregiver Tracking is not working for us but they are working to fix the problem.  I would suggest a small beep for low battery rather than the friendly voice reminder - it's a little shocking at 2am!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>How this product ultimately fares is yet to be determined. I am unimpressed as a new customer to be told one thing on one conversation and another on the second conversation. I wanted to pay for a year and was told to just pay for the first month,  make sure it works with our phone system and then call back and pay for the balance of the year. The story completely changed when I called back to pay for the 11 months left. I was also unimpressed that the unit came with nothing in the box so then I had to call for help setting up. I am not sure I will stick with this product since I don't have confidence it will perform in the event of an emergency based upon the two screw ups I've outlined.<//review>< rate>

We unfortunately didn't need to use the service too long, as my friend passed away within a few months. Whenever we used the service, they were very prompt in helping us out.
Ir certainly gave us peace of mind during these trying pandemic times.

Thank you.<//Review>

I took the time to contact Bay Medical and ask how I would be able to leave a review regarding our experience with their monitoring service.
My mom is 91 years old, fell and broke her hip last week.  All three siblings were notified immediately by Bay Medical and the paramedics were at her home within minutes.
She was so grateful to have them as a tracking system, that while she was still in the hospital, she asked if we could contact Bay Medical and let them know how happy she was. Bay Medical promptly got her the help she needed.  As she pointed out, everyone is quick to criticize, so it is important that they know what a great job they did for us.
Thank you Bay Medical for all you do for my mother and all those who need to have the reassurance that someone "has their back" 24/7!</Text>

<text>Mom is a new customer and so far we have been very please with the ease of set-up and the quick response of the staff when doing test calls.  They were very professional and friendly.  Also, I was impressed with how well the unit picks up Mom's quiet voice--even at a distance.  I am no longer worried that they won't be able to hear her--even from the lower level.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Bay alarm medical customer service is one of the most Prius customer service departments I've ever dealt with. I highly recommend anybody in a similar situation use them for their medical needs. Our situation is a 96 year old mother who is in an assisted living facility. We have used it several times with extremely quick response time. I mean, a couple minutes of the actual Falls taking place.< /Text>

Bay Alarm Medical has been a great solution for our family.  My mom has frequent falls and the fall detection devices really work!  The necklace works all the way out into her yard, so we can be confident when she works in the yard.  We also have the help buttons placed throughout the home so she can access buttons easily.  The customer service at BAM is second to none as well!</review>

Absolutely clear explanation of why we had the problem and what to easily do about it. Now I know to press the black reset button after a power outage or phone disruption and to test the device (necklace) monthly. Exceptionally, professional and personable service.
Just wish I hadn’t had to wait on hold for so long. I would have appreciated a call back service in lieu of the extended wait time. I was frustrated, when the call was finally answered, but your technician quickly put me at ease.<//Text>

I recently lost my husband and he was a subscriber to Bay Alarm.  I asked that the account be transferred to me since I live alone now.  Afterthe transfer, I tested the system and found it was not working properly.  Your staff member assisted me in getting it up and running .. her patience and understanding were really appreciated.  Unfortunately, I did not get her name.< /text>

<Text>My mother-in-law had an alert button with fall detection  with Bay Alarm for four years.  Fortunately, she did not have a fall that required attention.  She inadvertently set it off a few times, and the system worked and help was sent.  The only thing that concerned me was that when we dropped the button from shoulder height as a test, it sounded for help only twice out of 5 drops.  So, I'm not entirely confident that if she fell, it would alert for help if she was unconscious.  They told me that the results are different when the device is on the person who falls, but there is no way to test that, until a person falls and that's too late.  The employees have always been helpful and kind.  Consumer  Reports gives Bay Alarm high ratings which is one reason we chose them.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1615913563151, 'text': "Hi Cathy - Thank you for your honest feedback. We certainly understand your concerns as Fall Detection can be hard to test. With that being said, please remind your mother-in-law there is a button on the Fall Detection Pendant. If she falls and is still conscious and moving OR needs help for anything, as some emergencies don't include a fall, we highly recommend she press the button once. This should be her first option. The button will always work - the activation of the Fall Detection may not trigger if she falls and is still moving a lot (i.e. trying to get up) or if the fall didn't create a hard enough impact. Emergencies are hard to predict of course, so the Fall Detection gives her the security of both a button and the fall activation. We certainly want your family to be knowledgeable and aware of how it fully works, so please don't hesitate to ask any questions. You can always email us at support@bayalarmmedical.com Thank you!"}</response>< GmapID>

We have been using the monitoring service for several years for my elderly mother-in-law and her sister. Of course the ladies can get confused and accidently push their buttons, and the monitoring staff does a great job checking on them and making sure they are okay. Each of the ladies has also fallen and needed help, and the system worked well. The correct emergency personnel were dispatched each time, and the ladies got the help they needed. Their customer service is efficient and professional. Would recommend them highly.<//review>

I've been doing the test every month and the only thing I don't like about it is the weird very loud noises I get as part of the test.  Is it really necessary to be so loud?  And sometimes I have to hit the reset button to stop the noise at the end of the test, and sometimes I don't which makes me wonder why.<//review>

<Text>Bad product never worked correctly; beeped all the time; no one helps you over the phone; they disconnect you rather than save your place online for a callback.  Keep charging me even though I emailed them to cancel the service.
911 people couldn't find me or my address when I  tried to get ahold of help through Bay Alarm Medical.
I am stopping debit through my bank and trying to get a refund.  I am reporting them to the BBB.  Terrible company, a scam and ripoff.  They never took any responsiblility for sending me a bad machine that didn't work.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>My mom and I were both very pleased with the service
It worked when needed and called family first when she had a simple problem but she needed family help.  Another time it was well that Bay called 911 so she also got the help she needed quickly.  The wrist button was always with her and she didn't have to figure out how to get to a phone and how to call out.   I would recommend this to anyone in our situation .  Other friends and family use Bay Alarm.< /review>< pictures>

I called to inquire about ordering a lanyard and an additional bracelet. The bracelet my mother is currently wearing is apparently too tight & has worn a sore spot on both wrists. The person I talked to was very nice but since I wasn’t authorized on my mother’s account, I will need to call back with my mother present to authorize the order.<//Review>

Recently I assisted my mother in obtaining a new Bay Alarm alert necklace as the battery was failing.  The customer representative was courteous and helpful.  However, I am surprised and disappointed that my mother was charged for a replacement necklace, over $60 with shipping.  Aren't we renting this equipment as part of the monthly fee?  I don't think a fee should be charged for replacing any defective equipment.< /Review>

We navigated the phone tree ... we had to wait a few minutes before Alexis the tech answered.  She patiently walked us through the steps to reset the system and explained a few things to us quite clearly.

First time through the phone tree we ended up in a "general question" path and we waited quite awhile with no pick up.  We redialed and went to the "technicial help" path and got Alexis after about 2 minutes waiting.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

No complaints - the unit with fall detector saved the day when my friend fell down the stairs.  Emergency services were on scene very quickly.  Customer service very helpful when the unit was no longer needed and we called to cancel service.< /Review>

Corine (not sure of spelling, sorry) was very friendly and professional.  I appreciate that she asked for details to ensure I was permitted to access my father's account.

I was on hold for 5+ minutes.  That is the only negative of the call.</review>

My battery hasn't been lasting as long as it did at the start.  I was charging twice a week but now it is almost every day.  I wanted to know if there was something wrong with my unit.  It was re-booted and she thought that might fix this problem.  However, I won't know for a few days if there is a real problem or not.< /Text>

< Review>
Was in 2 parts:
1 - First was with a tech guy and was very frustrating since he omitted a key part of the directions on how to open the lock box (which did not match the directions on p. 9 of the Getting Started booklet).  During his directions, he neglected to tell me to pull the box part forward after putting in the combination.  I mistakenly presumed that I needed to pull up on the silver loop, as in a traditional combo lock.  When he finally said that, my problem was solved.
2 -  Second call I spoke with a young woman to change the location of the lock box.  That was handled easily and quickly.

BUT:  it was a bit frustrating to have to answer several questions to ID myself - surely 1-2 would be sufficient.< /Review>

<text>My experience with an excellent Bay Alarm customer service agent, "John", on 9/15/2020 was very satisfactory. He answered all my questions well, thoroughly, and gave clear directions to complete my inquiry.  The new "on the Go" mobile gps is a great improvement. The only difficulty, again, is the long phone wait to be connected to the agent and being kept on "hold." He suggested a better time for me to call in the future since I am in EST and he is PST, which I really appreciated. I also didn't realize they have extended their hours, which is very helpful. We are VERY pleased with Bay Alarm Medical! The do deliver on what they say!< /text>< pics>

<review>I like the service it provides for my safety. Recently I moved and down graded a few pieces of equipment. I called Adena to check on the status of my return equipment and I was told they had received the equipment. A email was sent to me. During my call I hung up our conversation. I called back and while on hold I received a return call from Adena. I was very excited to get a return call. I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN A RETURN CALL FROM ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE. She was polite, professional and clearly spoken. Great service and also my equipment. Thank you Adena and Bay Alarm.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /Gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>The low rating is because of the length of time I was on hold multiple times when I needed to contact customer service.  Mulitple wait times of over 10 minutes.  I wrote to them and suggested they enhance their call in ability by adding a feature telling the caller the anticipated wait time and the ability to leave a call back number rather than waiting on hold.  Lots of companies have this feature.  They said.  We appreciate your feedback and sincerely apologize for the long hold times. Our team is working hard in getting to everyone’s inquires as soon as possible.  Basically, they will stay with making people wait a long time.  I will say, the emergency response on the device is very good.  My suggestion is to simply go with the GPS help button and skip the other clutter.  The button is simply like a cell phone, one wears it around their neck and can call and talk with the emergency help team member.  One only needs to remember to put it on.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I am still undecided if I will keep this after the 30 day free trial.  So far each time I needed technical support I waited 40 minutes on hold.  That is absurd.  The support team was able to fix my problem but I need to test this system for a few days to make sure they can hear me if I press the button.  There was a problem.  I could hear them but they couldn't hear me.  Today was fine.  I will test again tomorrow.<//Text>

<Review>We had high hopes for Bay Alarm Medical for my elderly father as it came highly recommended, but when we actually required assistance for faulty equipment, Bay Alarm Medical did not help and did not even follow its own extensive and lengthy terms and conditions contract. We purchased the GPS plan, the fall detection plan, and a lockbox (recommended by them) along with the monthly insurance - everything we were told my father would need for a solid monitoring system based on his situation. Everything arrived within a week, but the lockbox did not work properly. After trying to open the lockbox for a while and then spending 20 plus minutes on the phone with the service department without success, my father was told to return the box and they would send a new one BUT he had to pay for shipping to return it AND pay for a new box and more shipping. (He would be reimbursed for the new box at a later date - minus all of the shipping charges.) As my father's account manager, I then called the service department and read the contract to the representative that stated new equipment would be sent to us at no cost, he informed me that he wasn't sure about that because this is how they handle returns. Fifty minutes of phone conversation solved nothing - which begs the question, if this is how effective they are replacing faulty equipment, how effective will they be monitoring the system? It certainly explains a lot of the lawyer-ease about how they cannot be held liable for basically anything in the contract. Bay Alarm Medical may have a decent operating system, however based on our own experience with what should have been a simple solution, we opted not to entrust my father's safety to them. We will look elsewhere.<//Review>< Time>

We have needed to use our Bay Alarm Medical system several times recently.  In each case a very quick response was received.  Customer service also provided great service in updating our contact numbers and priorities.< /review>

I do hope this review is read by someone at Bay Alarm. I was, I am quite sure, the most important person that Diane was to help on this day  :  )  Therefore, I gave her permission, after she assisted me, to leave work early.  I feel that Bay Alarm is an exceptional company and I have recommended you to many of my friends.  Thank you.   Jesse Rubin</review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1< /rating><review>Terrible customer service! After my mother passed away numerous attempts were made to contact Bay Area Alarm to cancel service, but due to COVID-19 their people seem to be working from home. I even set the alarm off to try and get some help and that didn’t work. I sent them a death certificate and returned the equipment, but they are still insisting she owes them money from when she was in Hospice and after she died!

The only time they attempted to contact me was after I shut the credit card off and they could no longer get their money. Pathetic!

Contacting the Better Business Bureau and AARP next.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1615915601249, 'text': "Hi Andrew - First and foremost, we are sincerely sorry for your loss. We certainly don't want to make anything more complicated during this already hard time for you and your loved ones. The charges you are seeing are from prior to the death certificate date and we were happy to waive two months of service. Our team has been open normal business hours through the pandemic via phone, email, and live chat. Again, we were happy to work with you on a resolution on a refund amount. We understand this is a hard time and don't mean to upset you in any way. We are here to support and assist the best we can.\n\nAll the best,\nBay Alarm Medical"}< /Response>

<Text>I suffered an electrical power outage yesterday[April 21] afternoon.  As I was instructed to do-I went into my basement-flashlight in hand] and disconnected my landline phone.  When the power was restored-about 4 hours later-I returned to the basement and reinserted the plug which I had removed 4 hours prior.  My landline phone is still dead!  I am quite sure that I places that plug into the proper place.
I did what Bay Alarm Medical  instructed me to do. I am without landline telephone usage. A service person will be at my house tomorrow afternoon. My landline will be connected.
I will not unplug the landline again.  I have endured enough stress.  If my choice of not disconnecting the landline clashes with your policy, then I will terminate my service with Bay Alarm Medical.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<name>Tony Suslovich</name><text>Reversing my initial review. Their claim of 30 days risk free trial is nothing but a hoax. They have a very hard time parting with the money you've already paid them if you want to cancel. I canceled about 2 weeks after starting a service with them. Sent the equipment back. They even received it in less than a month since the service started. Have an acknowledgement email from them about the cancelation. Next month I'm being billed again. I call and ask why they keep billing me when my service was canceled. They told me not to worry and I would get a full refund. A month later I call again to inquire and was told that even though they received the equipment, they're backed and would certainly credit my account within a week. It's been almost a month and I received nothing from them. Even their deadline for issuing refunds (8 weeks) has long passed. Not a very honest company and I would suspect that most of these reviews could be cooked. I would stay far away from them.<//text><Rate>1<//Rate><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

{'time': 1611262126553, 'text': "Hi Tony - Thank you for sharing your feedback and bringing this to our attention. We are sorry to hear about your frustration regarding the delays of your refund. To confirm, a refund was processed this morning and it will take 3-5 days to show in your account depending on your bank. It doesn't look like there was an issue with the 30 day risk-free trial as everything mapped out as stated on the website (i.e. return processing went smoothly). There was a delay in processing the refund to which we communicated with you about. However, we did find that there was an employee error in the process which is why it took longer. We are terribly sorry for the frustration and inconvenience you experienced through this and it was never our intention to have such a delay. We know there is not much we can do to change your review and we cannot go back and change what happened, but we are very sorry. We have made sure to address this with the team and employee involved to use this as a learning opportunity. If there is anything more we can do, please feel free to email us at support@bayalarmmedical.com.\n\nAll the best,\nBay Alarm Medical"}< /Resp>

<Text>Not impressed with customer service. I thought that I had canceled the service but now 6 months later I get a bill for $195. Tried to call in and get some understanding but instead of trying to help me they just kept threatening to send me to collections if I don't pay. Scumbags.

Had considered restarting the service in the future but I'll find somebody else now.<//Text>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1614967426268, 'text': 'Hi there - We have a very simple cancellation process that is stated on the service agreement as well as on the website. In order to cancel, you must send the leased equipment back or send a letter of cancellation (depending which device you have) which we will provide. Simply turning off the device or emailing us you want to cancel does not close the account. We are not sure what happened in your case, but we would love to take a look again if you could provide the account name, phone number, and  address. We do not charge late fees or any additional hidden fees. Just the fees that were agreed upon at the time of order/on the account. If you would like to send those account details to us please email it to support@bayalarmmedical.com From there we can take a look at the account notes and records.

Bay Alarm Medical Co. Tech Support Person Jennifer worked patiently and diligently to resolve a phone issue yesterday with my Mother-in-law after I had installed the Bay Alarm Medical At Home  system + GPS  Away system.  She even followed up today with me.  All the equipment tested out fine, was clear. and had exceptional range.  The Alarm Monitoring Staff were able to tell me the exact location of the house I randomly stopped in front during a test with the  Car GPS tracker for accidents and location.  The Caregiver App works well to track the location and store important information of your loved one.  So far, Bay Alarm staff & Monitoring Co. has exceeded my expectations!!<//Text>

They answered my questions and were very helpful. Haven’t set the system up yet. But so far so good.<//Review>

We've had Bay Alarm Medical for a couple years and have been very happy with the level of service. We recently started receiving emails warning of a low battery alert. Calling their help line was an excellent experience. June, the customer care representative, was very helpful, knowledgeable and patient explaining the steps we needed to take to resolve this matter. She was pleasant to talk to and never made me feel rushed. We feel very confident with this service and highly recommend it to anyone!<//review>

< Review>
We have NOT been able to resolve the issue. My 85 year old mother spent more than an hour on the phone with your company this morning and the problem is still not solved. She will be going to her bank today to stop any further payment to Bay Alarm. You keep blaming the phone service and yet that is NOT the problem...they have sent someone out twice and there is no problem! You have no one local who can come out to help! We will be looking for a new service with a local office. She needs this service....she fell a few years ago and cracked her head open! We are soooooo unhappy with your service.<//Review>

<text>My sister, brother, and I are most grateful to Bay Alarm Medical who gave us peace of mind in the care of our father who lived alone in his own home until recently at the age of 98 years old. When he was genuinely afraid at home one night and was unable to use his phone to call for help, he pressed the big alarm button on the Bay Alarm base unit and they helped him by calling for the assistance he needed. Thank you for your professionalism, caring understanding, and patience.< /text><user>112526040705918275096</user><Gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef</Gmap_id>< response>

I am pleased with the company, and representatives are great once you reach them. I sat for 30 minutes waiting today before I could talk with someone. Once I reached him, the representative was wonderful and mentioned there has been a lot of call demand lately because of weather issues. However, I have experienced this same long wait every time I have to call for some reason. Because of this,  it would be hard to recommend to family and friends.</Review>

After reviewing several different medical alert companies, the consensus was that Bay Alarm was the best value for the cost and their responsiveness was excellent. Although we have yet to utilize the emergency services, their equipment seems to test out flawlessly and their customer service has been great. Having procured this service for my mother who has just had hip replacement surgery, I have much more peace of mind that she would be responded to in a timely manner should an emergency arise if someone is not there with her.<//review>

Sales person misunderstood our needs and we ended up buying the wrong device. Now I am in process of calling for device that meets our needs. What's annoying is I was told that  despite the sales person not recommending the correct device for a large house  I am told that I will have to pay shipping on return.</review>

Zach was very thorough in his handling of my question.   He made me feel very secure in choosing Bay Alarm for my mom.   My only disappointment was the time it took to speak to a representative.    It was over 20 minutes.< /text>

My entire experience with this company has been excellent. The purchase process was easy and the rep was very helpful. The tech side was  also a very pleasant experience. She was very patient and was able to guide me thru my problems.This is how I wish all the companies I deal with, could be. You not only talk the talk but walk the walk. Keep up the much appreciated good work< /Review>

It is stressful to try to help elderly parents who live thousands of miles away.  Bay Alarm allowed us to set up the in-home system and they juggled all the details of different contact information for users, account holder, and other involved siblings without any errors.  When the alarms were accidentally pushed, individuals doing the phone checks were kind and understanding.  Thank you for running an honest and people-centered business !!</text>

Excellent customer service.  I've used Bay Alarm Medical for quite some time now for my elderly mother.  The device needed replaced and they handled it quickly, efficiently, and courteously.  No fuss, no charge, no problem.  I highly recommend them and their customer service team.<//review>

My alarm had an issue that Bay Alarm detected.  They contacted me and identified the problem.  Equipment is being replaced that should resolve the issue.  Bay Alarm was straight forward and efficient.  I am awaiting the replacement, hence the 4 stars.<//text>

While it took me awhile to get to the right person, once I did the customer service I received was better. I had tried daily - all week - to get a live person at a number left as a voice mail by Bay. At one point early in the week, I was told that the GPS device with fall sensor was “way too sensitive” to be worn around the neck on a lanyard. The gentleman I spoke to told me the device actually comes with a lanyard. He could answer every question I had. He did promise to email me my account number and tracking number as I was driving when we spoke - that never happened. Oh well, at least my mother can wear the device. UPDATE: Rec’d the GPS w/ fall sensor on Monday, 10/20. After setting it up, it worked perfectly in testing. We pushed the button and dropped it on the floor - in both instances, the response was immediate. Excellent!< /text>

In late December 2019, I fell in my laundry room and broke my back and suffered a concussion. I was unable to move but able to push my alert button. I was answered immediately, and the squad was here in just a few moments. I wouldn't have made it without your service, and I am more than grateful. Thank you and God bless you. Carol</review>

After we no longer needed the device, it took literally almost 2 hours to cancel the device. It was hold times. Press one to buy, press two to cancel.
We I was buying, no long wait times.
I was transferred three times. Put on hold three times.
Ridiculous!!< /Review>

{'time': 1615923872352, 'text': 'Hi Pam - Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear the cancellation process took some time, we will review and audit the call to determine the time it took and be sure to work with our teams to improve where needed. Our representatives do the best they can to get to every customer as quickly as possible in the order that calls are received. If calls are made to other departments, the reps have to transfer to the appropriate department because account access varies. While cancellation is a simple process, there are proper steps our representatives are required to take to ensure the safety of the account and details are outlined for our customers to cancel. It does look like the representative was able to assist you and provide all the necessary details. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact our Customer Service Team.\n\nThank you,\nBay Alarm Medical'}</response>

<Review>I ordered Bay Alarm two years ago when my mother fell and broke her hip.  We have the system and the lock box on the rail...Last October my mother fell again fracturing her Femur...Bay alarm had the paramedics there in no time and they used the lockbox to get in and get her to the hospital.  I would highly recommend Bay Alarm to anyone...gives me a piece of mind since I live out of state....<//Review>< Date>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>They came through when my mom had an incident that put her in the hospital for several days BUT they failed to tell me that I needed to set up the emergency profile online or maybe I didn’t hear or realize the importance at the time. As a result when mom hit the button on her necklace, it just dialed 911 instead of going down a list of family members and caregivers. When I called them to find out what I did wrong I was on hold for 21 minutes. It turned out okay and I have set up the emergency contact list online. I would think they might have followed up with me about setting up the emergency contact list since they are one of the leaders in the field. Not very impressive from the follow-up/customer service side.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>Kelly the service rep was so patient with me as I had a whole bunch of questions to ask.

She answered all my questions and I realized this is the product I need.

I needed to watch because I thought if I got a necklace I probably would take it off and forget to put it back on.

I am a senior citizen disabled who needs this kind of help since I live alone.

I fell the other night and couldn't get up because I have bad knees.  my little dog thought I was playing with her by laying on the floor and she was running around jumping exciting wagon her tail and licking me in the face.

I realized then that I needed some help and I found this to be exactly what I was looking for.  I did a lot of research and this was the best.  I haven't received the watch yet but from what I can tell I certainly would recommend it.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Always a quick response from the company when needed to use the alert button. Not just for the one who needed the help, but a quick response from the company staff to EMTs and family members. The only issue is that the device is sometimes difficult to tell if it is off or on, and if it is fully charged.</text>

<Text>Overall, I am satisfied with the service provided from Bay Alarm. However, when trying to cancel the service, they made it extremely difficult, mostly because of trying to get through. I spent too much time on hold and trying to call back to talk to a human. Not acceptable.<//Text>< GmapID>

Ive had a horrible experience with customer service. I was talked over with scripted talking and never let me finish my question. No one has reached back to me and there is no way to contact why? Im having to use my other family members cell and email/ FB to try and get help and nothing. This has caused me emotional distress. The Rep slammed phone on me and no one returned call. This is one of the worse experiences I have ever had.</Review>

Bay Medical Alarm has always provided excellent customer service for us.  My mom has been using their service for several years.  Last night I needed some technical support making sure her replacement device was hooked up properly.  Shawn was so kind, patient, and supportive as worked through all of the issues.<//text>

I called Bay Alarm Medical because I never received a bill this month. Turns out my debit card expired, but I still had a 30-day grace period while service continued, thank goodness. The operator was VERY helpful, taking the new information and handling my call with care and efficiency. I can't say enough good things about this company. They are amazing, customer service is impeccable, and I can rest easy knowing that their services are available for my elderly parents. Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical. I can see why you're ranked #1 by Consumer Reports. :)</review>

<text>They are attentive and easy to access with concerns.
Haven’t had a chance to use them because my 90 yr old mother didn’t want to”bother” anyone when she fell in the middle of the night! I try to reassure her that Bay alarm will assess the situation via the speaker and either call a family member if not serious or 911.  Just wish the button around her neck had a speaker so she would be sure to be heard wherever she is in her house.<//text><Resp>None</Resp>< Date>

Had been getting emails for a couple weeks to notify me that my mom's alert system had a low battery. After several failed attempts at getting someone on  their customer service number during the week I tried on a Sunday. (Email states their customer service is only available Monday-Friday) John picks up the phone after about 15 seconds of being put on hold by their automated system. John.was very professional and knowledgeable.  Answered all of my questions and addresses all of my concerns. Told me our units that we have are out of date and are sending new units out to replace. All that in less time than I was on hold on any of my previous calls. Thanks to John and his assistant I have regained my faith in Bay Alarm Medical Systems. By the way Bay Alarm, update you automated email to.say you have customer service on the weekends. Thanks again for all your help John.</review>

We were very happy with the service. We never had any isssues with any of the emergency calls. The fall detection was very handy. My dad fell often and someone always showed up whether he was inside or out.
Every person who answered a call was very helpful; and professional.
Bay Alarm Medical is worth every penny and gave us peace of mind knowing someone was always there when we could not be. I highy reccommend Bay Alram Medical.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Unbelievably kind and patient customer service - Jennifer was so informative and stayed on line with me and my over 90 year-old very hard-of-hearing dad in order to help in change a contact # on his account. Jennifer had the patience of a saint. This was very important for my dad & hard for me to help him from 900+ miles away during Covid pandemic times!! She was able to help us in a 3-way phone call. Plus, gave us additional recommendations to help him in his situation. God bless Jennifer & Bay Alarm. Tops!!</Text>

<Date>1610058756790</Date><text>I recently had my cr.card compromised and had to get a new one. I forgot that bay alarm automatically took their payment from it. I received a letter telling me that they couldn't access my card.  I had a difficult time trying to access my account online, so I called and got Ashley in billing. She was a pleasure to work with.  First she updated my cr. card info, then she set up my online account and got me a temp password. I didn't have to wait on hold, I opted for the call back option, which was nice. All in all it was a pleasure speaking with Ashley and a good experience.
Thank you, Doug<//text>< Response>

Have no idea what the product is like -- still waiting for it to arrive more than 10 days later.  Starting to regret ever having chosen this provider of a medical alert system.  Waited on hold more than 12 minutes to find out the status of the package and that it would not arrive for another 5 days.  Not impressed so far.<//review>

The Base Unit was dead on arrival but Bay Alarm replaced it quickly. Jennifer then helped me pair the watch button and the (3) Help Pads and everything is working fine.  It is a real piece of mind knowing that our loved one can summon help at the touch of a button.   Chaplain John Low</Review>

Bay Alarm Medical was very good to work with, polite, knowledgeable phone reps always responded in a timely manner.  We would have continued with their service except that mother relocated to an assisted living facility and no longer had need for her medical alert device.</Text>

I described a different system that I think will solve my problem.  I haven't received the new equipment yet, but am excited about trying it out soon.  The people I have talked to at Bay Alarm are so very helpful and friendly.

I called and was angry and frustrated because we are trying to cancel the service and received a phone call asking us to check the unit that has been returned.  The lady that spoke with me was courteous and listened to this angry woman (me).  She said we won't receive anymore calls to check the unit. I checked my tracking number and they received it three days ago.  She did a good job.<//text>

We've had it since 2012 (I think) and only had one false alarm that mamma accidentally set off. She felt very comfortable wearing the neck medallion, even in the shower. It gave her great comfort knowing help was just a push button away. It may help you to mark a calendar for the first of every month to test the unit. All in all a good experience through the years.< /review>

<review>Zach was phenomenal, helpful and extremely patient and kind with answering every question and addressing each issue I had! He had all my equipment up and running with our one phone call. I feel secure and at ease now that my Mom has the Bay Alarm Medical system . It's also comforting to know that I can call and a representative as awesome as Zach will be ready to help!!  Thank you so much Bay Alarm Medical!!

Sincerely, Your Happy Customer!

I updated this review from 3 to 4 stars, with an explanation given at the end.

Getting set up with a Bay Alarm system was easy and the alert service was fine. The quality of the base station and alert button was good, and the system was easy to use. My mom never had to use her alert button for an emergency, but the system tests always worked and we got notices if the base station lost AC power, like if it'd been accidentally unplugged.

I did have problems when I needed to cancel mom's service. Bay Alarm sent me a cancellation form, which I promptly filled out and returned. Turns out they sent me the wrong form and the service did not get cancelled. But no one contacted me, and I didn't know until a few weeks later when I got an auto call saying that the base unit was not connected.

It took several phone calls with many transfers and VERY LONG hold times to finally get another form, which also turned out to be the wrong one. So I called them again and finally, I hope, got the correct form. Total time on the phone was nearly 2-1/2 hours.

The Customer Service reps were all very nice and did their best to help, but the company's record keeping, internal communication, and integrity regarding billing are lacking.

The first rep I talked to said he'd cancel the auto calls and restart the cancellation process, but then I got another auto call after that and learned that the service was not cancelled.

Another rep said they'd received the original form I sent, but then another said they did not receive it. Also I was told that my mom would not get a refund for the month that followed my original cancellation request, in spite of the fact that they had sent me the wrong form. I'll be watching to see if they charge her for this month as well.

**** Update ****
Bay Alarm Medical got back to me about this. Gjenes from Customer Care expressed his concern regarding my difficulties cancelling and also got the payment refunded for the month after the cancellation. My 91-year old mom was very pleased about this, and we appreciate the attention given to this issue.< /text>

My father fell this morning and Bay Alarm did not come online and talk to him.  He waited on his kitchen floor with no help for over 30 minutes.  Bay Alarm finally did contact paramedics and they eventually did show up and helped my father off the floor.  He then called Bay Alarm and waited over 60 minutes to be connected finally with John at Bay Alarm.  John did work with my father to get the system tested and working apparently but I would call this a fail.  John, age 25,  was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and my father would give John a 5 star rating.  Thank you, John.  The whole purpose of having this system is to help a person who has fallen and can't get up on their own.  If my father had hurt himself badly during the fall, this would have been a very serious situation and he would have been left on the floor injured or possibly dying.  This cannot be a system that works some of the time.  Not happy with the outcome.</Text>

{'time': 1600802962916, 'text': "Hi Marc -\n\nFirst and foremost, we are sorry to hear about dad's recent fall. Please send him our well wishes. We did speak with John C. and checked your account as well as the alert signal. It looks like there was no voice connection over the speaker box at the time, so dad did not speak directly with a dispatcher, but the dispatcher received the emergency signal and followed proper protocol all the way through. Remember, even if we cannot hear the user, we will always treat the alert as an emergency. In this case, the alert was signaled and in less than 10 minutes, our dispatcher called for an ambulance. We cannot confirm how long the ambulance took to arrive at dad's home nor do we have control over that, but we are very appreciative that they arrived and were able to help dad. We definitely understand the fear and frustration during these scary moments. We see that John was able to run a successful test with dad and everything is working as it should be. We always recommend loved ones test the device at least once per month to ensure it is working on their end (see test instructions below).  Dad is more than welcome to give us a call so we can run that test with him  we'd be happy to help! We apologize for any frustration you and dad felt at the time and we will continue to make improvements where needed to give our customers a 5-star experience.\n\nProper test:\n1. Press your button one time\n2. Wait for it to connect to dispatcher just like you would in an emergency\n3. Let dispatcher know you are okay and it is just a test. That's it!\n\nThank you,\nBay Alarm Medical"}< /Resp>

I ordered on Friday. Confirmation email told me I can check status online   I couldn’t find a place to see that. I emailed. I was told it was being processed and I’ll get email when shipped. 2 days later no email. I called. It’s on the truck to be delivered today. That’s great but why didn’t I get a shipping email with tracking number. And where on website can I check this (that question hasn’t been answers yet). I hope service with device is better than this</text>

I did a lot of research before deciding to go with Bay Alarm Medical.  We've had my Mom's unit for almost a year now, and every time I need to deal with their customer service I am more confident that I made the right choice.

The people that respond when my Mom has pushed the button, as well as the customer service reps that I have dealt with are exceptional at what they do.  We have recommended Bay Alarm Medical to many of her friends and my friends who are in need of this type of service.< /review>

Bay Alarm Medical provides great customer service and a variety of product options to meet your needs. Sometimes it takes a while to get through to them on the phone (I assume due to COVID), but they have a great call back feature to save your place in line so you don't have to stay on hold. The reps have all been very polite and helpful. Some are more knowledgeable than others. I am happy with this service so far.<//text>

<review>Have been customer for 12 years, Just replaced system after 12 years due to battery problems so can't complain. Main problem is time it takes to answer emergency calls.  Even on test call I get concerned with time it takes to hear someone answer. Otherwise company is great.< /review>< Pics>

Bay Alarm was Perfect for our Mom, while she needed it. Great customer service, Quick Response, and Very Caring. What I liked about it when I made my choice of which service to use, is she didn’t have to charge it like some units have to be. Also it’s much smaller than most of the others. We usually did a test on it every couple weeks, it worked great. It was set up in a central part of the house, and could be heard thoughout the house. Mom never had to use it, but it was a good feeling to know she had it as a necklace, (it also comes as a bracelet) if needed. It wasn’t GPS but when she went out, then she had her cell phone with her. We were Totally Happy with Bay Alarm System. Thank You!<//Review>

Technician, John, was helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly.  But, the automated phone system to reach tech support was horrible:  an absurdly long wait with terrible music interrupted only by irritating automated messages about  the company's other products and services.< /review>

<Review>After an exhaustive research process to find the best in-home medical device for my 81 year old parents located in Bradenton FLA, I decided to go with BayAlarm Medical - believe me I researched extensively!
I was extremely pleased with the assistance I received from one of the supervisors there INGRID - she was fantastic.  We spent quite a bit of time on the phone to address all of my questions and concerns, as my parents are in FLA with no family close by.
Decided to go with the in-home system with pendant and 2 emergency wall buttons $24.95 / mo), as well as the AT&T 4G LTE ($10 more per month but don't have to worry about landline failure due to storms / outages), a very attractive snap on jewelry piece (4 of which to choose from) so it doesn't scream that my Mom is at risk of falling - looks like a very nice necklace and very lightweight, an extra pendant for my father, and a lockbox. And no contract to be locked into!

My main concern is whether the AT&T signal strength will be at least 2.5 down there because areas with large bodies of water tend to have decreased signal strength.  Hoping when I am down there next week that we can position it in a clear spot with strong signal - really hoping it all works out - but it not, I can return for full refund within 30 days. Ingrid gave me her direct number for any questions yesterday.

Another thing to be aware of is the technology in the Fall Detection  industry is not yet perfected and may cause an excessive amount of FALSE FALL readings - this applies to all of the companies who offer this - my fear was that after finally convincing my parents that they need a medical alert system, I thought they would get turned off by repeated false readings - for instance if they plopped down on a couch and system thinks it is a fall - and some annoying issues -  decided to wait on that option until it is much improved.  This system package should provide peace of mind for all of us until we figure out what needs to be done long-term.

Today I tried to order it online, but I was not able to request expedited shipping (only standard for $12 was available online - hope that gets improved)  - given COVID, weather, etc. all things have been delayed - wanted expedited but could only do that by calling in the order.

Well it was yet another pleasure to reach REGAN today - she was so helpful in getting everything set up quickly and again addressed all of my questions and got the order ready to go out tomorrow am and arrive by end of week even during the Christmas Rush!

Well, so far, very impressed with customer service, reviews, options, and the "pretty pendant my Mom chose" - will provide an update to this review once we set it all up with monitoring folks and test it out.  PEACE OF MIND FOR ALL FOR NOW!!!!!!!

Thank you Bay Alarm Medical for having such excellent people on your team like INGRID and REGAN - give them a raise for dealing with me - ha!< /Review>< Date>

<Review>Bay Alarm Medical worked flawlessly for my mom.  Operators were professional, efficient, caring & polite each time my mom hit the button.
Police + an ambulance were dispatched when needed.  Even when the at accidentally hit the button, operators were warm, friendly and understanding.  My mom felt safe and we had peace of mind.  Cost was certainly reasonable.  I would highly recommend.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>Rico was very knowledgeable and kind. Gave me the wireless option which is a great relief because I didn't have enough power  in the right places to add your device. He checked the wireless status in my area, judged it OK and will be sending a. new base device after i agree via email to the extra monthly fee.

THANKS SO MUCH, RICO AND BAY ALARM MEDICAL!< /Text>< rating>

I ordered the Bay Alarm Medical devices for my 89 year old mother in March 2020. She lives alone but we have home health aides at various times during the day and thru the night,

On Sunday morning June 8, 2020 I received a call from Bay Alarm that the fall detection on my mother's necklace had activated. When they made contact with her she stated she was injured. Bay Alarm initiated the emergency call list and also called local EMS.

We also have a security camera in Mom's apartment to keep an eye on her when no one is there to make sure she is OK. After I hung up form the Bay Alarm operator, I checked the camera and she was indeed laying on the floor by the apartment door.

Fortunately my niece lives only two blocks from Mom and I am less than five minutes away so we got there very quickly. the EMS arrived just a few minutes before me and right after my niece arrived.

Mom suffered a fracture of the upper right humerus and will be in a sling for "many weeks".

The over-night aide had left at 7am, the next one was scheduled for noon. In reviewing footage from the camera Mom fell at 8:41am.

If not for Bay Alarm system our mother would have lain on the floor for over three hours in excruciating pain.

We are so thankful for extremely quick response of the Bay Alarm call center representative - he called within two minutes of mom falling.

I've already recommended your service to several friends who have elderly relatives living alone.

THANK YOU!!!!!

Sincerely,
Don Robinette

This has happened several time now. When I email the billing department (now 4 times) no one responds . My first email was over 3 weeks ago.</text>< response>

I purchased this for my mother and assisted her in setting this up. A month ago it suddenly went off. A strange out-of-state number came on and since those are nearly always phishing calls - and they are many - I ignored it. But I quickly saw that voicemail was left and then knew it was from Bay Alarm.

I instantly made phone calls since I am two hours away. My mother was helped within 15 minutes. What a gift and help this is!

From what I understand from my mother she never pushed the button. It was the fall detection that went off.

I am very glad for this device. It was worth the cost. It is also very convenient and effective.

Mom is now moving into an Assisted Living facility as a result of her fall. She will no longer need this as it will be provided in that facility.

Many thanks and much appreciation for the great work you do!</text>

It took me two calls and very long waits to reach a customer service representative.  He was very helpful and pleasant once I got through, but the length of time I waited on on the phone (I eventually hung up the first time) was unacceptable.<//review>

You sent me new equipment which I have not been able to install. I called customer service and they said that technical support was closed after 9 p.m. and they would have them call back the next day. Yesterday came and went without a call. Now I will have to start over trying to get assistance. Bad way to run a business where a person's life depends on good service. Tried calling technical support but have been on hold for twenty five minutes and still waiting. Terrible service.<//Text>

The confidence and assurance it gave her to have them available at the push of a button allowed her to sleep better and live her life more fully in her condo. Today we part ways with Bay Alarm Medical after 5 and a half years as we move her to her next life in a place where she can have help more readily available that provides this service as part of their housing area. Thank you Bay Alarm Medical for your great staff and comfortable caring service even when I called to cancel service. Always professional and quality support!

We were notified of a low battery on my mother's pendant.   This notification via call to her personal cell phone, her home phone and by email to me (her son).  We returned a call to Bay Alarm and were walked through checking the unit, verifying the problem and ordering the replacement  while being assured that the unit was fully functioning and would be until we received the replacement unit.  My mother lives alone and Bay Alarm has actively cared for her for the last 3 years.  She trusts them implicitly and so does her family.  Bay  Alarm allows all of us to feel comfort and reassurance that she is as safe as possible living alone at age 93.< /text>

I have been a customer for 6 years and do not have a single complaint about this company.  Everyone I have dealt with has been experienced, pleasant and ready to help.  I have had no issues with any of my equipment and the few times something strange happened, they were on it immediately.  Being 73 and living alone, it is a small price to pay for my peace of mind.  I highly recommend this company.</Review>

I regrettably had to call to cancel this wonderful service because my loved one is going into assisted living. It was a great help to her. I spoke with Alexis, and she was prompt, courteous, and professional. My loved one did have to use her emergency button a few times, and the agents at Bay Alarm Medical helped in a flash, contacting the emergency person immediately! I recommend this service to anyone looking for peace of mind for their loved one.<//Review>

<Text>Talked with Julia today - terrific experience!  She helped me understand what I did and didn't need, and she clarified the fact that the basic need - which was also the least expensive - fit my profile.  Speaking with her was much more helpful than simply filling out an online form.

Julie was patient, thorough, and answered m questions perfectly.

I ended up placing an order, and love the fact that I can return the product within 30 days, if it doesn't end up being right for me. However, I am confident that it will be.

Thank you Bay Alarm Medical for your values and competence.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1574454983529, 'text': 'Hello, thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience.

I got this service for my mother because I saw great reviews online. But here is how it really works
Every time I try to call, I spend up to an hour on hold waiting for somebody to pick up the phone.
We have been trying to cancel the account for ages. We unplugged the equipment and mailed it off weeks ago. They can see it is unplugged, but they say until they have received the equipment, you have to keep on paying. Apparently there is no end date on that, so if they keep saying they have not received the equipment, we are stuck paying them forever, for a service we are obviously not using.
This is no way to run a business.</review>
<pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1594058529010, 'text': 'Hi Robert - Thank you for your feedback. We apologize for any confusion and misunderstanding regarding our cancellation process. To clarify, the account remains active until we complete the cancellation process. Cancellation of the account is not when a customer unplugs the equipment. Because it is leased, we have to receive it back to our warehouse and complete the inspection. Please note, the process takes a bit longer due to COVID-19 guidelines, as we are taking extra precaution for the safety of our customers and staff. However, this does not mean you will be charged for the time it takes to process. Bay Alarm Medical always honor the postmarked date, so you will not be charged for anything based on tracking. For example, if your billing payment is July 1st and you return the equipment with a postmark date on or before July 1st, you will receive a refund for any auto charge that processed on July 1st. Again, we apologize for any confusion and frustration. We are happy to have clarified and hopefully that addresses your concerns. You will receive an email when your account is fully cancelled.\n\nAll the best,\nBay Alarm Medical'}</Response><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

I bought Bay Alarm Medical for my 86 year old mother who was living alone.  It was comforting knowing that there was someone there to help her at the push of a button.  She used it when she fell and broke her hip.  We're very grateful to Bay Alarm Medical for helping her when she fell.

Bay Alarm Medical was always picked up right away whenever we tested the unit and when it was used for an actual emergency.

Easy setup and ease of use.  I would highly recommend.  The only reason why I cancelled is that my mother moved into assisted living where they have there own system.< /review>

We have been VERY happy with the Bay Alarm Medical Alert system. We have had it for seven years for my elderly mom. When she had to use it, it worked just as it was supposed to. Whenever I’ve needed to call customer service for any reason, they’ve been very professional and helpful. I would recommend Bay Alarm to anyone who’s looking for a medical alert system.< /review>

<Review>We have Bay Alarm for my 91 yr old mother.  We put lots of Help buttons all around our house & garage.  Sometimes we accidentally set it off & they call so quickly. It’s comforting to know if there was a real emergency it will work so well & so fast.  We even gets calls & emails to people on our contact list if the battery is low or of someone doesn’t answer the Help Call Back quickly. We checked with other alarm companies, and chose Bay Alarm because they let us have so many Help buttons   We probably have 10 of them all over the house by the floor & near the shower.  My mother could reach out with her arm to push the Help button or could crawl.  She won’t wear the necklace  which is why we have Help buttons all over the house. They give you a  lockbox  with a code & we put a key inside in the event EMS ever need to gain entry   We’ve had Bay Alarm for 3 years.  They are very reasonably priced & a wonderful company.  Can’t recommend highly enough.  Kim Thrasher< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>We would highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical to anyone planning to use a Medical Alert System.

There have been no negatives, only positive experiences with the company.  They never cease to be there when the system shows an alert.

We have never once had an issue where they did not respond immediately when an issue occurred.  Again, we would highly recommend, their home products, as well as both the system itself and their employees!

Thank You Bay Alarm Medical for a job well done!< /text>< Pics>

Technical support is very slow since Covid 19 but help assistance is still fast. Fastest way to get help sadly is to call select opt new customer ans answer that explain need help with tech not answering or call back.if it has been over 2 hrs. They are very good but getting to technical  support is why 4 stars instead of five stars.< /Review>

<review>The one reservation I have is:  what if I have a stroke but don't fall.  I am lying in bed and am unconscious.  In that case I urgently need help but Bay Alarm Medical can not reach me because they have no way of knowing what has happened.  I am 84 and I would think that this must be a common occurrence   with people of my age group.<//review><username>Philip Eidelberg</username>< resp>

I called customer service the other night to cancel our service. Unfortunately, my husband didn’t comprehend how to use it. The cancellation process went very smoothly. The person I spoke to was very pleasant, understanding and informative. She specifically explained the steps I needed to follow. Her professionalism was of the highest standards and greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your service.<//text>

After many tries I finally got to talk with someone.  Once you returned my call after many hours. I could hear the Rep. but he could not hear me.. Finally today a Rep called back and took care of all my questions. He was very cordial, polite and patient. He gets 5 stars from me.<//Review>

Bay Alarm is a dependable company. In the short time we use them, our minds were at ease. When a parent needs some extra help and you can't be there all the time pick Bay Alarm you won't regret it. Thanks for all your help. Your workers are wonderful.<//Review>

<review>This is my first experience with a Medical Emergency Response System and I have had loads of questions, made mistakes testing my new device and on one test the EMS even came to my door. After all this, Bay Alarm was still kind and patient with me, answering my questions. May I use my age (87) as an excuse?  With what I know now, I rate Bay Alarm Medical  with 5 stars.

Customer service as been excellent and very patient ansering all my question for a home alert system that I bought for my mother. We have not set up and tested the unit yet but that I am sure will be effortless as the instructions appear to be very clear. Cannot comment on use of the equipment and hopefully will never be able to but the piece of mind that my mother will have this should she need it is priceless. With my experience so far with sales and customer service has been flawless. I would recommend this company.</text>

<Review>Our experience with Bay Alarm Medical was excellent from the beginning to the end.  Most recently, my call with Alexis to cancel the account was smooth.  She was very polite, patient and provided all of the information I needed, even before I asked!  I would certainly come back to Bay Alarm if needed in the future and would recommend to others.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My mother currently lives and uses her device in the Bay Area where BAM is located. She’ll soon be moving out of state, so I called BAM to inquire if she can continue with their service. Easy peasy! I learned from John that AT&T coverage is good where she’s headed and that the only change would be to let BAM know of her new address once she moves...one less change to make!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

We chose Bay Alarm Medical to help guarantee the safety of a relative.  Bay Alarm was prompt, courteous, reasonable and helpful in all of our interactions.  We no longer need them but I would use them again without hesitation if the need arose.</text>

My customer service rep was wonderful.  Very kind, professional and helpful.  She explained the process of getting the lanyard with the Bella charm and how the return would be made with the wristband...when to expect the lanyard and what to do when I received it.  Very thorough.

I even commented that everyone I had dealt with from Bay Alarm Medical seemed like they had gone through a”Disney Training”.   Very rarely is everyone to helpful.

Thank you</text>

<text>We are moving my mom this weekend and called Bay Alarm for instructions on what to do.  The lady on the phone was absolutely the best.  She was very nice and told me exactly what I needed to do in order to move mom and the emergency equipment.  Bay Alarm's service is above and beyond.
Keep up the excellent work</text>< Name>

Friendly enough when signing up for this service, but they make it very difficult to cancel!  And if you want to write a check to close out any balance due it will cost you $30 bucks extra.  Ridiculous.</Text>

I will give your tech support, Alexis, 5 stars.  However, I ordered this unit a week early to be able to use it when we were in Hawaii for Christmas for 2 weeks.  It arrived there several days after we left.  I did ask when I ordered it if it would arrive by first class mail which should have been before we did.
Hopefully, it will give us good coverage throughout the Silver Valley where we spend our time even though it is mountainous.< /text>

<Text>It has been a Frustrating process. About two weeks ago I signed up to receive a medical alarm for my grandma. I received a confirmation email and assumed it would be on its way. It never came. I called today and was flip flopped to 5 different reps (all were super kind and pleasant) but I would get transferred and the new person had no idea why. The last lady I talked to was Jamalia. She was fabulous, she was patient, got me my answers and set up my account. Another reason for the three stars is that I had to pay an extra $30 to expedite shipping.

I hope our experience improves from here.<//Text><rating>3</rating><UserId.>101815796196278122880</UserId.><gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef</gmap_id><resp>{'time': 1589478928227, 'text': "Hi Sarah - Thank you for your feedback.

We had a power failure and my equipment was not working. I called and the lady who answered was most helpful and courteous. Since this was the first time this happened she told me all the steps to restore my equipment in easy to understand ways. She also told me I should test the equipment once a month which I did not know.< /text>

I had a not so swell experience with another life alarm company a few years ago and dreaded the thought of ever getting another monitor- then I read the reviews for Bay Alarm Medical and called. The wonderful customer service offered on the phone - just answering my questions - sold me.  Even the therapists working with my mom say this system is the best they have seen - they love the fact it offers the HELP buttons to install at floor level. Thank you for your service and product. I will be telling friends about this for their elderly parents.<//Text>

I was scheduled to have surgery to remove a meningioma brain tumor and doctors told me there was a likelihood of having a seizure before surgery. I was not feeling well and was on my own during the day up till time of surgery and I thought a medical alert button would provide me and my family peace of mind. I researched and selected Bay Alarm Medical based on the reviews and the fact I could use only as long as needed, also cost was reasonable compared to other devices.  Surgery went well and I am now fully recovered and back to work.  With device no longer needed I had no problem canceling. Having the Bay Alarm Medical device gave me the peace of mind needed during these four months.  Note, I did use several times and their response time was immediate and professional.< /text>

The gentleman I talked to was very helpful! I am a senior and he talked very slowly so I could follow what he was saying. He took his time with me which I really appreciate it, and he stayed with me through the whole set up process!  He had a very pleasant voice which was also helpful!

<review>I was setting up the upgraded medical alert for my daughter. I called Customer Service to see how to turn off the old one so I could replace it with new one. As always, customer service was there to help.  They walked me through everything and answered all my questions.

So thankful of this wonderful service, helping my mother to stay in her own home alone, per her wishes.  She wears the necklace faithfully, and we have 5 alarm sites in places where she is most likely to fall.  Not had to use in an emergency yet, but comfort in knowing it is there.<//review>

So far Bay Alarm seems to be very good. We Thank God haven't need it. Hope we never do. When my mom did her test the representative was very courteous and helpful. I was very pleased to see Bay Alarm sent me an email to tell me the power was off during the nite. and to check the system. Thought that was Great.
What I didn't care for was, when I placed the order I wasn't sure if my mom would want the pendant or the bracelet. So I paid for  both, was told I could return which ever she didn't want. I returned one  the very day we got it. I didn't get refunded until I called to ask about it almost a  month later. I've been told it has been applied  to my cc, will see when I get my statement.</review>

<Review>Needed to get an alert service for my 85 yr old Mother.  With so many to choose from, I was happy to see the high ratings for Bay Alarm Medical.  They have been true to their reviews!  Always answered proptly with any tests we ran on the equipment and customer service has always been pleasant, helpful and responsive.  The plus for my Mom was that the alert device, whether on the wrist or around the neck, was small and easy for her to use.  Will recommend Bay Alarm Medical very highly.< /Review>< Pictures>

Every time I have called Bay Medical for help, the response has been pleasant and professional. I never hesitate to call because I have always received such care and today was no exception. Shawn called me back because the wait time was long and helped me test our system staying with us through the entire process explaining what to expect. True customer service!!! Pleasant voice with a  great helpful attitude! Excellent service!  Thank you Bay Medical!<//review>

I am Using Bay Alarm for 2 family members. I’ve never had a problem. Always reliable, courteous, helpful and what you see is what you get. Bay Alarm doesn’t try to trick you into higher paying plans or make it difficult to change your plan unlike what I experienced years ago with Life Alert. I highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.</Text>

Made call today to change emergency contact info, but because every contact has been consistently of the same quality, I will generalize. Every Bay Alarm person who has served us has been disciplined to cover every detail in a precise, careful manner, just as you would hope for a monitoring service, but has remained personable and down to earth, always willing to explain things, and never giving the sense that they are hurrying you, or that you are somehow inconveniencing them. An amazing combination, and we are thrilled with our choice!<//Review><user_id>115989971747537204580<//user_id>< gmap_id>

<Text>The most simplified system ever! Just plug in and that's it!!  My parents live in a remote area, I ran a test to find  extent of parameters, I could clearly walk across a whole acre of land. I can feel safe, they'll have coverage while in the back yard -garden.

I listed some pros, I have no cons.
Pros:
Affordable cost of products
Affordable cost of subscription
Ease of set up
Ease of use
Quick response
Clear communication
Range of coverage
Size of call button
Long lasting battery
No need to recharge
No contract
No penalty
No marketing catch

Before purchasing, I compared 3 top products and found Bay Alarm Medical to be the best pick. I am very satisfied with my decision.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Bay Alarm Medical has been such a good positive experience. Thank goodness we haven't need their services in an emergent type of situation, but working with them has been a breeze. Love their systematic way of communicating. Quickly found out that the billing method on file had expired. Called up and Jessica helped me very seamlessly. Asked the needed questions quickly and efficiently, was very kind and cordial and professional, as well.</Review>

I called in the evening to change my address. I waited for a long time and so I thought I would have better luck if I called in the morning hours. The same thing. They gave an option that they would call me back if I left my number. I don't like to do that because I don't know if I will be available when they call back. I finally got a representative to answer my call. He was very nice and I got my address changed in their system. He even had me push the help button so he could check to see if the change of address went through. After that he had me go to different rooms in the house to make sure I didn't have any dead spots and could alert from every room. He was very nice. It is just the waiting so long no matter what time you call. They need to hire more people.<//review>

Set off alarm inadvertly, it surprised me, because didn't know I pushed the button. The system gave two calls for help, immediately followed by a Male voice asking if I needed help. I replied no, and then the man asked to verify my address. He asked me again, if I needed help. I replied that I was fine. All of this activity to place in less than a minute.
System seems to work as advertised.

Beware if your address changes and if you wish to cancel service.  To accomplish them you must call in  and you will hold and play phone tag for days.  Even though we gave them the address change over the phone, when I tried to cancel the service online almost a year later, I realized that they still had the old address.  It is as if the phone conversation changing the address never happened and they would have sent help to the wrong address.  You cannot cancel online so they have a chance to question your logic and caring of your loved one (scare tactics).  You must pay shipping to return the equipment and even though you have notified them by phone regarding the cancellation, they still send "severe past due notices" , causing anxiety for your senior loved one, and they still charge you for service until they receive the equipment...which they tell you takes two weeks after they actually receive equipment.  Don't trust a company that makes it so difficult to cancel service.  Check out BBB complaints.< /text>

We have already started an investigation into your case in regards to the address change. This is a very serious matter and we are taking a closer look as to what actually occurred and if necessary, what changes need to be made. Our goal is to serve and protect families across the U.S., so customer feedback means a lot. While we aren't perfect, we are always working to improve - never to hurt others.\n\nPlease understand we have no intention of inconvenient phone calls back and forth. We always call customers back during business hours. To cancel, customers simply give us a call for proper power down instructions and cancellation details. Customers can cancel at any time without cancellation fees. If customers choose to cancel, they are responsible for the return shipping costs. We like to ask questions in regards to cancels to see if there is anything we can do or improve, there is absolutely no harm meant here.\n\nAs explained over the phone and in the cancellation email you received, the account is still considered active until we process the cancellation entirely. Since the equipment is leased, we have to inspect and go through a cancellation process. If a charge occurs during this process, we always refund based on the postmarked date. It looks like your account is fully cancelled as of 6/9.\n\nDeanelle, we never intend to cause harm or frustrate any of the families we assist. We apologize deeply for your frustrations and again, we are currently working through your case to see where we can improve.

A vital piece of equipment was not in the package when it arrived just before the weekend. (Looked like someone had opened the box, removed it, and resealed the box. Ultimately, I reached someone on Monday who was very helpful and sent out another of the item. I sort of expected someone to answer either the phone or the email during the weekend since equipment problems don't just happen on weekdays. The agent was very courteous.<//review>

I have been very impressed with the service from Bay Alarm Medical! Since my first call to inquire about their services, they have been informative, helpful and available. I purchased this service for my 100 year old grandparents who live in another state, and it gives us all peace of mind. It has been easy to set up and get working, I highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.

I have continued to use this service and continue to be impressed! My grandfather has now passed and my grandmother moved in with my uncle. It was easy to move the number and set it up for her new location. Just one call and everything was updated. It gives us all so much peace of mind, you cannot put a dollar value on this incredible service.< /Text>

Easy to set up & their customer service is outstanding! I haven't had to use my alarm yet, & hope I never do. However, it gives me, along with my friends and family,  peace of mind knowing I have this system ready to go in case of an emergency.</Review>

{'time': 1603823363384, 'text': 'Hi Jim - We are sincerely sorry to hear about your loss. We are very understanding at how difficult these times are and do our best to make the cancellation process simple. We do not charge any cancellation fees and only require the equipment back in working condition as it is leased. We are very transparent about these details on our website as well as the service agreement and at the time of order. Now, we do not want you to feel frustrated or upset and we are always happy to work with families as every situation is different. While we cannot stop billing and monitoring due to safety reasons, the representative kindly let you know we can refund the account once we receive the equipment back. There is no way to stop billing and pause the account or close the account while the leased equipment is still out. Again, we are more than happy to refund the account once the equipment is back to us. We deal with many families and different situations and we do our best to accommodate, especially during difficult times.\n\nThank you,\nBay Alarm Medical'}</Response>

My mother in Florida activated her alarm after she fell down.  Bay Alarm called me in Connecticut and one other relative as well as the local fire department.  This is our first experience after having the alert necklace for 6 months.  This makes me feel more assured that my mom will be getting immediate assistance if she falls.  Thanks Bay Alarm</Review>

I don't even want to talk about the other two times I talked to first a lady and then a man, who were no help at all. They had me unplug several cables and plug them back in again, and it was determined that all three of my calling for help devices had no problem with their batteries.  And I hope I will not ever have to go through with that again''
thank you so much for your patience with me, Alexis

I thought Bay Alarm was a good enough company until I tried to cancel a fully paid up account when my Mother moved into assisted living. They say they have no cancellation fees but they make the process very inconvenient which amounts to a fee because  you end up continuing to pay while they make the process hard. You can’t just send the unit back and stop paying either because they turn you over to collection even when you clearly have attempted to cancel. I will not use them in the future because of the difficulty in cancelling when the time comes.< /Text>

My experience was great. Alexis answered my questions about moving across the country and taking my system with me . Alexis walked me thru the process with tact, grace and knowledge.  I have referred two friends to bay alarm and both have purchased it.
Keep up the good work folks!

<Rate>2</Rate><review>I received several missed calls and e-mails regarding a low battery on my elderly mother’s pendent.  Understanding the urgency of the situation I called back Bay Medical to order a replacement pendent.  After waiting nearly 30 minutes I asked for a call back, which of course came at a time when I could not receive the call.  This process was repeated 2 more times in the same day and finally, after waiting over 2 hours for a call back, I finally received one.  The call to replace the pendant took nearly 8 minutes.  All of my mom’s information is on her account which the rep had pulled up.  Overall a much below satisfactory response from Bay Medical.  I understand with Covid many call center employees are working from hime, but for such a critical item, Bay Medical has to do better.  Very disappointed in this lack of customer service.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I've been taking care of my 88 year old mom. I've had to make many calls on her behalf, but my experience with Bay Alarm has been so positive. They've worked with me, answered my questions quickly, and made it a smooth transition so I could help with my mom's account. Also, Bay Alarm works. Several months ago, my mom pushed the button on her lanyard and 911 responded immediately. The responders took care of the situation and helped my mom.</text>

We installed the Bay Alarm system for my mom yesterday. It was very easy to set up and we were very impressed with the staff (who promptly answered our calls). We tested the system from multiple locations in the home and each time we tested the various buttons, a Bay Alarm employee answered our test calls with efficiency, courtesy, patience and kindness. We feel much more secure now that the system is set up, and we are more confident in my mom's ability to live independently with the Bay Alarm  people just a touch of a  button away. Thank you Bay Alarm, for a quality product and a great customer experience.<//text>

<text>Everyone I have spoken to at Bay Alarm Medical has been extremely helpful, patient and knowledgeable. Adina in Tech Support was particularly eager to make sure we were able to use the system properly. Today, John in Tech Support walked us through a set-up that was a challenge as I was on one phone with the subscriber and on another phone with John from Bay Alarm Medical and a number of configurations did not work before we were able to get the system working and the subscriber also having regularly working phone and computer. It took an hour and required patience on everyone's part, and in the end it worked!! Yay</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

So far, so good. Although my mom lives in NJ and Bay Alarm is Located in California, it doesn’t seem to be a problem. The few times that she has pressed her alarm button, the representatives were extremely helpful and help was on its way. So here’s to hoping that Bay Alarm continues to be competent. We are very happy with their service.< /Review>

<text>Bay Alarm Medical is an outstanding service and their equipment is top notch. From customer service to responding to emergencies, we were impressed. We looked at many different companies while selecting which medical alert service would be right for my mother in law. The lockbox for emergency responders and the vial of life info were so valuable when needed. I can’t stress enough how important both of those features were for us. Do take the time to write all of your elder prescription info.
We received the equipment quickly after we initiated service, had great over-the-phone instructions for setup. All in all, we are very happy we chose this company and strongly recommend them to anyone needing to protect a loved one.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1568217610339, 'text': 'Hi Thomas - Thank you so much for sharing your experience with us.

I couldn't have made a better choice when reviewing alert systems.  The price for this service is not outrageous..  Its a fair price for those seniors or others who need this.

Customer Service is always wonderful when you need some help with easy set up.

Thank you for this service at a great price.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I had a 5-star experience with the customer service person but was disappointed that I send a directive 5/15/2020 but wasn't told until 5/25/2020 that you couldn't read the signed directive. After I immediately resent the signed directive I called the customer service number and she checked that you had received the resent document and it was legible and it was being input at that moment with the data entry people.<//review>

We received our items in a timely manner and the Tech team were so very patient and helpful in getting the unit set up.  My mother can hear the unit very well.  So far I would truly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.< /Review>

<text>I was very pleased with the service. However I had to cancel as it wasn't what we needed. It only was for the house so it did me no good anywhere else. There is someone here at all times as my husband is completely bed bound. My budget did not allow me to upgrade When I called to cancel my service everyone was very helpful and kind.  Thank you!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Customer service has been excellent.  The product itself is great.  My only issue is accessing the account online has been less then stellar and there was an issue with the reoccurring payment.  The original purchase went through no problem, however the first months payment was denied and we had to call several time to fix it.  Attempted to do this online however the website never updated the information.  As it turned out there was nothing wrong with the card and we had to call several time to resolve the issue.</Review>

<text>Solid response time. Great customer service. Great value (researched so many companies and this is one of the lowest priced and one of the best services).

She rendered the best customer service support that I have received in years - hands down.

I fell outside my home and could not get up because my arm and knee were hurt. I pressed the wrist button. I had no way of knowing if it was received nor could I be heard inside the house. After a few minutes I waved at a passing truck.He stopped and helped me up. Then my daughter arrived and took me to the hospital.
I could not tell if the light on my band had lit up, Perhaps a different color would be better.< /Review>

<text>Ordered this for my mom. Easy plug and play set up. A small hiccup when testing as they were not able to connect once we activated the base unit. Called their toll-free number and was routed to tech support. They stayed on the line with me and checked everything, and stayed on the phone as we re-tested the base unit, the bracelet, and the fall unit.

They were very courteous and helpful.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

We've just gotten started but Bay Alarm Medical has been awesome every step of the way!   Helpful people gave us information we needed and guided us to the ordering step.  Ordering was easy and even more helpful people made sure we got exactly what we needed.  Set-up was simple and even the first call made by a just toddling great-grandson resulted in some laughs when Bay Alarm called to check on our parents. Thanks for making this an easy transition from the difficult decision our family had to make.< /review>

<review>Would give it No stars if possible,customer bears all costs of shipping stuff ,even if it is not needed.having to pay about 20.00 to send back an old unit which i suspect was o.k.but they want to sell me a new box,there is more shipping .Alltogether it is a first class rip off.If you hear bay alarm,run the other way.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I pay for my mom's monthly service with Bay Alarm. It's a piece of security for me when I can't be with her. We have not had to use the emergency button as of yet. Only for monthly testing of the monitor.  I have called customer service several times to ask questions and everybody has been very nice and professional. Thank you Bay Alarm!!<//Review>

<Review>It was a pleasure working with Bay Alarm.  They gave us the peace of mind we needed when our elderly father needed the service.  It was very easy both starting up the service and cancelling the service when it wasn't needed anymore. They were always prompt, courteous and efficient each time we activated the system to test it too.  Great service!<//Review>< rate>

We have been Happy in the past with the customer service and equipment. However, we recently upgraded our equipment and something happened with our order. It took  3 and half weeks and two phone calls to receive the new equipment. Evidently the order was not processed as it should.< /text>

Your rep, Rico, was extraordinarily helpful to me, after the first two reps I spoke with gave me incorrect information. He explained every step we would follow, so that I knew where we were headed. Rico stayed with me on the phone as I tested 27 locations in and about my house to see if the the pendant alarm reached each location. It did. Rico is the kind of employee who represents the best side of  a company. Many thanks for his help.<//Text>

I called and a technical support person assisted me. His name is Valentino and I frankly never had such an excellent experience. He is extremely knowledgeable, but
what made the experience, which was time consuming because I am  technically challenged, was his incredible display of patience with me. Another very important aspect of his assistance, was checking to make sure all was operating properly before we hung up.

Good communication system in place.  While on hold on the phone, I was given the option of a call-back, which I appreciated so that I wasn't wasting time holding on.  The technician provided friendly, professional and competent service.  I'm a new customer in the set-up phase, and so far so good in terms of customer service.</review>

Rep was very helpful and patient with my request to cancel the
service and guided me on how to disconnect the unit well enough
to return it to Bay Alarm.  He gave me the return address, checked
it twice, and explained that I have to return it post marked by Feb.4th.
I kept the original box, so it was easy to pack and return.  Unless there
is heavy snow in Seattle,  I will make sure to meet the deadline.</text>

Technical assistance was excellent.  I was setting up a lock box for a key and, after programming the code in, the lock would not open when I tested it.  The technician was extremely patient and very thorough as she walked me through various steps to correct the problem.  Turns out there was nothing wrong with the lock or how I coded it.  I was trying to open it by pulling on the wrong thing.  MY BAD!</text>

policies enforced during cancellation process only favor the company and offer no consideration of the customer.  I notified the company about cancellation and reason for it.  Later I received email from company with instructions to return hardware.  I expected this email, was surprised it took several days to arrive  and was not prepared to deal with it while the actual move was in-progress.  I was surprised that I would continue to be billed monthly for the equipment as if I was actually using it during the move process.  Therefore, I was paying my monthly charge for no benefit to me.  I was also informed I would continue to be charged my monthly fee until the equipment was received at your California office.  I did not have the time during the actual move to box up the equipment and take it to a shipping store while I was trying to get moved to a new location.  Also, do you know how long it takes most shipments to reach your California office - - why am I being charged my monthly rate for transit time - - obviously, I was not using the equipment during that time, and therefore again, you collected money from me  when there was no benefit to me, the customer.  You were collecting money from me for no service or assistance.  I don't think that is right.  I will never recommend your company's services to others, regardless of how good it was, because of this customer-adverse, customer-held-hostage policy.  Right now, I am wondering why I initially chose Bay Alarm Medical for the services I needed and was looking for.  I certainly will investigate using the services of another company before I would enter into another agreement with Bay Alarm Medical.  Thank you for listening to my concerns.< /Text>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Thanks for your courtesy, I had to suspend my service temporarily and was treated very well.It was greatly appreciated.
I have to withdraw my favorable review.as Bay Alarm withdrew their offer.They will no longer allow me to temporarily suspend my service while I am recuperating in a convalescent facility. I will have to continue to pay the monthly fee even though I am not using their service.The alternative would be to permanently discontinue the service and return the equipment (which would be difficult in my present situation).
So change my 5 star rating to 2.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//Gmap_id>< user>

Also, there was a long wait on the phone but they have a call back feature where I was able to hang up and go about my business and they called me back in a short time.  That was nice!<//review>

Bay Alarm Medical was very patient with my mother's mistakenly setting off her alarm.  They were prompt in notifications to my sister and me as well as notifying first responders.   I recommended Bay Alarm Medical to all of my elderly relatives and their adult children.  Bay Alarm Medical gave my sister and me a piece of mind, knowing that my mother would have medical help if a fall or other emergency should occur.< /review>

Just set Mom up with Bay. Minor technical issue on setup. Customer Service was superb, issue resolved quickly, and Mom is wired in now. Monitoring Center equally superb (spoke with them twice during the set up tests), amazingly quick and responsive. Very very pleased thus far with Bay!!!</text>

<review>During a test of Mom's equipment, the staff member was very professional, patient and walked me through the process of testing both devices my Mom has to ensure they are working properly.  She has only needed to use her call button once when she fell and Bay Alarm Medical was there for her!  They immediately contacted a family member to assist Mom.  I full trust in Bay Alarm Medical!</review><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

I got all confused trying to sign another cell phone into the Caregiver app.  Valentino did a fabulous job with helping me get the account squared away.  I'm thinking that this service is mostly helping seniors like myself to track their even MORE senior parents!  So the customer service representatives need a LOT of patience, but Valentino helped me to get everything set up on the cell phone and waited while I documented my info so I wouldn't forget. Kudos to you folks!</text>

Called to replace a lost pendant. June was very helpful and patient. As I was not the actual customer, but a son-in-law, it got a little involved in providing payment information without the primary user.

It all worked out, but I would recommend the ability to buy accessories with a non-coordinated card (my credit card) as opposed to the card that is tied to the account.

Thank you.< /text>

Excellent customer service. My only issue is when ordering a replacement button, due to my parent loosing the original and not able to locate it after a week of searching, that the replacement is not shipped overnight. I did not balk at the shipping cost and even understand if an additional charge was required for overnight shipping.  For some one who relies on wearing the device for a sense of security, having to wait for a week or more is a bit disconcerting. I live 300 miles away and I also have a sense of comfort knowing my parent is wearing the device.</Review>

<Time>1575475203729<//Time><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>I have no reference regarding personal alarm systems, so in all fairness I would have to say my one concern is if I am no more than 20' away from the base unit (which is centrally located) and in the same room
the system works fine.  As I was testing the personal alarm a couple of days ago I was actually SHOUTING that I was fine to the operator and she kept asking if I was okay.
I was walking throughout the house and each time I was SHOUTING at the operator that yes, I was fine.  I have a voice that is loud normally
So SHOUTING is not necessary.
I will keep the alarm system for a while longer and make my decision whether to return it or not.< /Text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1575488830650, 'text': 'Hi Joyce - Thank you for your review. We are glad to hear you are okay and that your equipment tests went well. It looks like the emergency dispatcher came through the system and followed protocol as usual. Please keep in mind, their main priority is to get you help, so even if communication cannot be established they will continue to treat it as an emergency and either contact your local ems to send help or your emergency contact list, whichever you selected to be first. (Our default is 911). If you feel like they cannot hear you when you are nearby the base unit, please be sure to give us a call so our Tech Support Team can further assist you. We are always available to answer questions and do the best we can to provide a positive experience. We hope you never have to use the system for an emergency, but if you do - we will be there to help. Thank you again.\n\nBest regards,\nBay Alarm Medical'}</Response>

I was om the phone with this young man for quite awhile. He wanted until I got the neighbor to come over to my residence to assist. He walked us through a;; the possible fixes and finally it started to receive. The problem was the hookup devices that the phone company used & they didn't hook my alarm system correctly into the wall devices. That young man was wonderful & so very knowledgeable.<//Review>< pics>

<date>1582124323617<//date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>I only have one BIG complaint:
When my mom used her button for the first time, you discovered that the phone numbers you had for her emergency contacts were wrong.   If my mom would not have been alert to give my phone number to the paramedics we would not have been called.  I was told that the phone numbers you had in your system were the ones we had provided on our form....I find it funny that I would have put down my phone number wrong and my sisters...maybe one of the numbers, but not both. Maybe it was an error when they entered them into your system…but that is beside the point.
Here is my problem...why didn’t someone reach out to me either by email or letter to say "contact us with correct phone numbers"???  If I would not have called in that day, you still would have the wrong phone numbers for the emergency contacts.
By her having that button it did SAVE HER LIFE and for that I am extremely grateful!
I just wish someone would have reached out to let us know to contact you about our phone numbers.

Have been a customer for over 1 year and they just sent me an upgraded unit. Someone installed it for me but neglected to disengage the old unit.
Called customer service and got a great technician named Aron.  With much patience and diligence he walked me through disconnecting the old unit and setting up the new one. While testing every operator did a fantastic job of making sure I was not in the middle of an emergency.. Overall a great  company with excellent customer service.< /review>

My mother has been using Bay Alarm Medical for years and the system has been a lifesaver, literally.   The people at BAM are always helpful when we called to tweak our call list or had questions. They made suggestions and gave us options so we could make informed decisions.   The system has worked perfectly. Very good service!< /Review>

<Text>TESTING EQUIPMENT.
3-27-20.Lady said she pressed wrong button,  then asked if I wanted a "full" test and for how long.  I have never been asked that before.  When I pressed the Help  Button, it said "call connected" and beeped for 5 min. and weird noises.  I waited and the same thing occurred again.
I then called Bay Alarm and talked to Hanna who connected me to Jomelia in Tech Support. Excuse spelling please.  She instructed me to press reset button and got it to work again.
I hope this goes better with next month's testing.
Stay safe.</Text>< Rate>

I have not been an easy customer. But they never give up. I thought something was wrong with the set up and was tired of all the beeps and calls and ready to send it all back. But then I took the time, once they began calling my family members, to make sure to follow their instructions, which were not difficult. Their quick response showed that I really could trust them and my family will be happy not to receive those calls. Unless , of course necessary. I appreciate that they stayed with me when I was going a time of great distress.< /Review>

<Text>I tried to make a test of your service.  After connecting to me, I told your associate it is a test, I would like you also call the list of 4 persons on my list form, to see their response: such as do they answer?  can they recognize it is an emergency call from you for their parent?  I like the test to show them your caller ID so that they would not ignore it.  This is a practical important nowadays, because there are so numerous robot calls, scamming calls each day, people (including me) would not answer those calls they cannot recognize.  I don't know what they can see the caller ID when you call them.  Unfortunately, in the last 2 weeks, I tried two tests, and asked your associate to call them, you DIDN'T call them.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1581622101075, 'text': 'Hi Jianzhong - Thank you for your honest feedback. We are glad to hear you had a successful test that connected to our dispatcher center and they were able to check your status. If we are notified it is just a test, we do not usually call the emergency call list as our dispatchers have to be available and ready for emergency calls. In the event of an emergency, they will check your status and if they do not hear a response or if you tell them you need help, they will then go ahead and follow the protocol set up by you on the Customer Information Form you filled out. We definitely understand this concern so we will go ahead and email you the phone numbers from our dispatch centers so that your contacts can put them in their phones. Those pesky scam calls have definitely made people weary of answering calls, so we can understand your concern and frustration.

<Text>We had a false alarm that appeared to be a system glitch with phone lines crossing??? It was a traumatic experience thinking our Dad had an emergency and having emergency services sent to his home, turned out he wasn't even home!! I asked for a call back since it was after hours, never received a call!

On the flip side, I called today and the advocate did a great job, she was calm, knowledgeable, reached out for help when needed and calmed down a very angry and frustrated customer. We are adding a GPS tracker so we always know where he is and Bay Alarm can reach  him when he turns his phone off or doesn't hear it ring.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

While we have been generally very happy with your service, and feel our parents are safe with your system, this most recent issue of a broken receiver unit has not been the same kind of quality.

My parents were without service for 2 weeks. When mom first talked to you, a new unit was supposed to be sent to them, and was not. I got involved about a week in. I initiated a 3 way call, and we found out the issue was that your unit had gone bad, and I was promised a new unit would be expressed to them, and they would get it in a few days...by thursday,

It did not arrive then, and it did not arrive until the following Monday, via USPS....which was definitely NOT an express shipment.

I appreciate that you did not charge then for the 2 weeks they were not covered, and I sincerely hope that you have figured out where the snafu was. My parents were , thankfully, fine while this was happening. But if they had not been, it would have been a very different conversation.</text>

had lost our mother and trying to get the service stopped and what other items that needed to be done.  I contact Bay Medical Alarm Customer Service and was connected to a gentleman by the name of John.  John was very friendly and very caring about the situation.  He was able to answer all my questions.  He also took the time to find an email that I had sent requesting termination of the service and made contact with their billing department.  He advised of last thing that we needed to do and also what to do with moms equipment.  I wish when ever I had to contact a Customer Service Department for any company they would be as friendly, courteous,  and as helpful as John was.<//Text>

I bought this device for my mom after her stroke, I feel at piece knowing help is a push of the button away. She fortunately doesn't need it anymore, I went to cancel and you have to have it postmarked by the due date or will be billed again. My mom lives and hour away and being winter, she had a State emergency in her town, they closed 35W  a major highway between us down and called in the National Guards, I told them I would be happy to pay for an extra month and they just extended the date due by two weeks at no additional charge. Very happy! If we need another in the future I would definitely be going back to Bay Alarms. Very professional.</Text>

Instead of waiting in line on hold, I could leave my number for Customer Service  to call me when my turn came up.  That was a real time saver, and greatly appreciated.

When they called me, my issue was addressed promptly and efficiently.<//review>

I advised the representative of the death of my parents (they passed only 2 weeks apart from each other).  He was very compassionate and helpful.  He explained the procedure for powering down the unit in a very clear and thorough way.  He explained how to return the unit and the cut off date of the postmark to avoid being billed for the next billing cycle.  He made me very comfortable in handling yet another "to do" item  that is required upon our family's loss.< /text>

My mom lives alone so we got her a Bay Medical alarm necklace. Within two hours after we left, apparently my mom fainted and fell. When she woke up, there were paramedics in the room.  They called us and we met the ambulance at the hospital.  Mom is fine now and we are so grateful she had the alarm necklace on!!!!! Thank you Bay Medical!  Merry Johnsey<//text>

Thus far we as a family are very happy with Mr. Robert's Bay Alarm Medical personal life alert system. It is a bit sensitive, but we are happy we made this choice. Better to have a false alarm than no alarm at all. As well, the customer service department has always been very helpful, just as was the sales staff in determining what system we needed. Thanks for giving us some peace of mind in Mr. Robert's care.</text>

<Text>Best customer service and attention to clients!

Follow up after using Bay Alarm Medical for both my mother and mother-in-law for over 5 years...
The service has been literally life saving and is the most dependable with the absolute best customer service.  I highly recommend Bay Alarm to all my friends who are looking into a medical alarm system.  We used another well advertised company before this and there is NO comparison in cost, ease of beginning and ending service, dependability and customer support.</Text>< Name>

My customer service person, John Andrade, was very through and helpful. I have a major complaint about the time it took to reinstate me. I was put on hold too many times. The system was canceled for 2 months at most. It should not have been that much of a process. It took longer to reinstate me than the original order. I would strongly advise you to take another look at process and improve it greatly.</review>

It was very easy to order my dad's Bay Alarm Medical system online. It walked you through step by step. There was great communication through email as to when it was shipped and when Bay Alarm received our paperwork and that it was ok to set up and send a "test" call.  When setting the system up, being very sensitive, there were a few "test" calls that went through. The operator on the other end of the system was very patient.  We have had a great experience so far. Thank you so much! :)<//review>

< Review>
Highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.  Especially after talking with reps from three other competitors.  They are the only company offering medical emergency alert “button” services that includes pricing on their website.  Additionally, their sales reps are very polite and courteous, and don’t use any high-pressure sales tactics.  They simply talk to you to determine your needs, explain how their devices and services work, and provide very clear payment information.  Also, very prompt shipping and great support for any follow-up questions.  AAAA++++< /Review>

Website is very customer-friendly & price for monthly service is the best!  Like everyone else, upcharges for added features can send your fee right up there, but if it is something needed, the cost is nothing.  For any question, give them a call.  Everyone I have spoken with is extremely friendly, knowledgeable about their products, super helpful!!<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>We received our device yesterday and it was very easy to setup and test.  It worked well and the response time was impressive.  We were talking to a rep within 30 seconds!
Then I called because I was concerned about my own phone blocking or mislabeling any calls from their control center in case my mom had an emergency.  They gave me the number that would appear on my caller-id so that I could add it to my contacts and mark as important so that it would not get blocked. Phew!
Any phone contact that I have had with their customer service has been very helpful and courteous.<//Text>< Response>

Twice today we have spoken with tech support.  I failed to get the name of the first person and the second person was June. Both were knowledgeable, patient, helpful and flexible. We are new subscribers to Bay Alarm after a great deal of research and we are hoping that it proves out be be as good as the references say it is. So far, so good.<//text>

<text>The Bay Alarm system we set up for my Friend worked precisely as they indicated.  He is 100 years old and has taken several falls and in each
incident Bay Alarm has responded quickly, patiently and with professionalism. Contacts were notified first in each case and were able
to get him back in his chair or on his feet again. You cannot measure the comfort level Bay Alarm gives us knowing they are our back up.. Our deepest appreciation to everyone at B A.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<user_name>Bernadette<//user_name><Text>Bay Alarm is fabulous.  The woman on the phone when I first called to inquire about the system was extremely kind and helpful.  I love that I can cover both parents with the same devices and I can get as many devices to put around the house as they want.  When the equipment arrived, all we had to do was plug it in and push the button to test it.  Couldn't have been easier!  The operator responded in 4 seconds and had at his fingertips both my parents' information.  I feel confident my parents have the tools they need in an emergency.  No need for them to worry about whether or not they are near their phones and no fumbling around trying to figure out how to make a phone call in a panic - just push a button and they're good to go.  Literally, this could not have been easier.  Add in the extremely reasonable price per month and Bay Alarm simply cannot be beat!</Text><Rating>5<//Rating><GmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /GmapID>< UserId.>

I read dozens of reviews of alarm companies before I decided on Bay Alarm for my mom. I have no regrets. They are quick to respond to emails, friendly on the phones. I’ve change alarm devices 3 times to meet my mother’s demands and they have made it all very simple.  We finally had the chance to see the company in action. On sept 10 my mom pushed the button very early in the morning because she woke up with back and chest pain. They quickly dispatched the paramedics, within minutes my 2 sisters and I received phone calls from a representative letting us know what is happening.
The paramedics came and wanted to take her to the hospital, she asked them to allow her a moment to put clothes on and brush her hair, they refused and left. Bay alarm got back on the line with the ambulance and insisted they come back immediately.
Great job Bay Alarm. I’m glad you are looking out for my mom!</text>

I received the ordered device fast. However, I could not find any installation instruction mentioned in the letter. The installation was simple, so I figured it out. I tried to reach technical support or customer support for some questions. I was not able to reach them after several attempts. I was always put on waiting for a long time. I left my phone number, but never received any call back. I am disappointed with their customer support.<//Review>

I spent a lot of time researching medical alert companies.  I am so glad I decided to go with Bay Alert.  My aunt, who is now 90, was determined to live independently for as long as possible.  My three sisters and I were determined to support her, although she has very limited vision due to macular degeneration and severe hearing loss.  Her apartment is less than 5 minutes from my house, but I am a full time teacher.  Bay Alarm could not prevent her falls, but knowing that as soon as she pressed the button, someone was speaking with her, and contacting me.  I do not know the names of all the wonderful people who provided the warm, reassuring voice of help on the way, but each of you earns a star in your crown!  Because of you, I could sleep nights and teach days without a constant sense of anxiety.  You gave Bernice her independence because I had confidence that she was never 'alone'.  She has chosen to leave Texas and has moved into a wonderful assisted living apartment near her son in Ohio.  I do not have enough words to express my appreciation for all you have done for us these past years.</review>

I was the laggard in this event.    I was unable to get to any phone in a timely manner and missed at least three calls.    Wait a little longer for me...that is why I have Bay Alarm....      When we all connected the next morning the 12 hour power outage was passed as were the attendant problems.   Everything from that point on went most smoothly with the help of Idina and fellow workers on the alert line..< /text>

The alert features and the holiday price can't be beat. The range of detection exceeds most other companies and the ability to answer the phone with the alert button is an excellent feature. Great experience!< /review>

She listened to my story about my stolen wallet and was very empathetic.  She immediately did her job of changing the card number and then she did a minute charge to check to make sure that the card was functioning properly.  That was impressive to me.  Thank you for the excellent service.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
I ordered an alert system from bay alarm for my Mom.
It arrived as scheduled. My first system did not work,
I called that afternoon around 6 and had to leave a message.  It was returned the next day.
I returned to my Moms, called them back and after trying everything with them over the phone
They determined the system did not work.  They told me they would send another one out express mail.
It arrived 2 days later and worked right away.  I called them to help me set up the necklace part and extra help buttons.  They stayed on the phone with me and we got them up and running.
So I am very please so far-  the only reason I didn’t give the company 5 stars?  I think they should have a better answering machine message stating their hours.  It would have reassured me that they just weren’t engorging my call. If you call during their hours they are very helpful.< /Review>

We set everything up last night and tested everything and they responded so quickly and were patient with us and so helpful.  My mother is 93 almost 94, she's independent and just stopped driving, but we still worry about her and want her to be safe... she is the world to me and my sisters.  I am so happy I chose Bay Alarm, now I can rest knowing that if anything happens and we are not there, Bay Alarm will take care of my mother!

< Review>
My total experience with Bay Alarm Medical from beginning to end was wonderful.  They were SO pleasant and helpful from the first time I called to inquire about their system and even asked questions which I had not thought of to help me determine the best options for my 98 year old father.  Did not try to oversell me!  The cost was inexpensive compared to others and had more to offer.  The product was received promptly and the instructions were easy to understand (especially for someone as technologically challenged as I am!).  Having this system definitely gave us peace of mind whenever Dad was alone.  True to their word, since we did not need the system the entire time period which we had paid for, they promptly reimbursed us the balance as soon as they received the returned system.  I highly recommend them!!!  Thank you for your awesome service!  Delores Minnix<//Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I am very impressed with Bay Alarm Medical.  Today I was hooking up my medical alert system for the first time and had the opportunity to see how fast they work in an emergency.  I was just testing it and somehow it wasn't known I was testing it. They called me on my phone and I didn't get there in time to answer.  I didn't think anything of it until the paramedics came to my door in no time at all.  Not only that, several times I had to call Bay Alarm with questions and someone always answered right away and helped me.  Unknown to me, about an hour after I thought it was installed correctly I received a call from them telling me my system was indicating low power.  It wasn't connected correctly and I didn't know it.  I felt as though they were watching over me.  Thank you, Bay Alarm.</review><Rate>5</Rate><response>None< /response></record>

So far i am pleased with the Bay Alarm system. My wife and niece checked the signal at several locations on our 1.5 acre property. The signal was successful at all the locations. I feel safe that the system, will be a great comfort to all 6 of my siblings. My parents are 88 and 90 years old and have recently become dependent on their 7 children.This system allows them some freedom from having someone there every second of the day.</text>

I got this Many months ago after my father had a fall.  It was easy to install, if anything a little twitchy (if the neck unit got bumped hard, or we had a blackout) it would go off and I'd be talking to somebody who would check in to know if we were having a problem.  I consider this a good thing, as the default was to check up on Dad.  The unit never had problems or went off for no reason, even with Dad wearing it night and day.  The service people were great on the phone, especially the guy who helped me uninstall it and pack it for sending back after Dad died. He explained how to power it down, when billing stopped, etc.  I'd highly recommend this service and device.< /Text>

Vanessa was extremely helpful to my Mom and really took time to understand what she wanted/needed.
She made sure to explain how things worked and how to return items since she was getting a wireless system. She explained charges and made sure to get verification.
Thank you Vanessa.< /Text>

<review>This company has always been very helpful and quick to answer any questions.  It is  comforting to know that my Mom can alert me with just the push of a button if she has a problem.  I picked Bay Alarm because they had the best rating of any  alarm companies that I researched.  I used them for about a year now and am pleased with their services.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I got a full package for my dad last year--pendant, gps, home unit, which included the Caregiver Tracker app for my cell phone.  I hadn't followed up on the app, and realized I really needed it when my 90 year-old dad failed to answer the phone one night.  (Turns out his landline was dead and he couldn't hear his cell where it sat on the charger.). I talked to Jennifer at Bay Alarm Medical and she talked me through how to set up the app on my phone, which allows me to LOUDLY ring my dad's gps unit at any time of day or night to signal him to call me.  He knows if he doesn't call me, I'll be sending EMT's.  I was also able to register 3 other family members to do this, too. This feature is a huge comfort for me.  Cannot say enough about how patient and helpful Jennifer was.  Five stars!</Review>

Although my Mom just got the system I had sent her, she was pleased with tele-help she got setting it up.  I looked at reviews and Bay Alarm verified they had cell service in her area since she does not have a land line.  There was no pressure,  reasonable monthly rate, customizable options and answered many questions.
The only reason I have given Bay Alarm 4 stars is even though I set up account as payor and my mother as recipient, they sent her package to her address with MY name on it.  This review and communication was sent to my mom's name, so they need to to fix that.  They asked for who to bill and receive communication and who recipient is, and I gave correct info.  I am sure there are others setting up accounts for older family members and taking care of details.</text>

Equipment functioned as expected. I cancelled the program weffective with the billing cycle which was effect May 13, 2020. I have ALREADY been Billed the annual fee, however JESSICA advised me your firm will submit a creit to mya assigned account. However as you know, that leaves me to still PAY the BILL, unless and until I receive a  a full refund.refund.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Top-shelf customer service on every aspect of our experience with Bay Alarm: the initial call to gather information was with a knowledgeable and professional rep...questions answered with absolutely zero pressure; delivery and setup of equipment was as represented, no problem whatsoever; no hidden charges or any surprises; and when we made a mistake by using the wrong credit card, the company was totally understanding and helped us straighten things out. When  a family finds itself needing to retain the type of services offered by Bay Alarm for a loved one, there are also many other stressful things that need to be confronted. It’s such a relief to deal with an enterprise that provides patient, professional and considerate service.</text>< pictures>

I called Bay Medical to find out about changing my service from using a land line phone to a cell phone.  I wasn’t sure if they did that but your people were most helpful.  He explained the process and price as well as how the cell issues can affect the lines. I was very pleased with the help and told them i wold get back to them after I did some looking into making that kind of change.

All of your people that respond to my “button call” monthly are very pleasant and helpful..  I’m very happy with your service.

I got this service for my mom who is in her eighties and living at home. It brought such peace of mind. There were several instances where she slid onto the floor and was unable to get up. Each time this service responded promptly and sent help out to her. They were also very good at contacting me to let me know what had happened. Totally worth the money. Highly recommended.<//review>

< Review>
After hours and hours of confusing research online looking for a medical alert system, we selected Bay Alarm Medical. Consumer Report was very helpful in comparing several systems, which helped simplify the hunt.
We have been clients now for four months and am impressed again and again.  The customer service and tech support is patient, clear, helpful and very pleasant to work with. We selected the In-Home system with fall detection and the GPS pendant system for away from home with fall detection.  We also added 2 wall "Help" buttons near the floor in the bathrooms.

We just moved the whole system to our summer home and updated our  address, contact list, and tested. Even when the alert goes off by accident, they are very patient and supportive.  When I, the wife, & installer, need help or advice, they are always there!  I particularly liked and still use the videos online - clear, not complicated, easy to follow & understand.  We both highly recommend the Bay Alarm Medical system.  The peace of mind for us both is so reassuring!</Review>

<Review>We got the system for my mother, who lives with us, after she had a fall in July. My mom fell recently in the kitchen while I was at work. She activated her alarm (I wasn't sure she would ever use it, even if she did fall) and the dispatcher called the fire department since I could not be reached. I am grateful to the dispatcher for staying on the line and talking to her while help got there.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

While the service is good I was very disappointed to learn after a year and a half that I need to replace the button my stepmom wears.  It cost almost $60!  I think for what I am paying monthly the button should be covered.  I also would expect it to last longer w/o having to be replaced!  I could get a warranty for another $5/month that covers all repairs. If I need more repairs I will looking for a different company and will be sure to check out the replacement costs!<//Text>

During my first test call I was having a serious static interference problem with the base unit.  I could not hear a word that the operator was saying so I had to reset the unit mid-call.  The operator immediately  called back on the landline to determine if my mom was experiencing and actual emergency.  After I explained the static problem he transferred me to tech support after making sure he had my number to call in case we were cut off.  It gets better.  The Gentleman in tech support took me through no less than 4 tests in order to solve the problem.  He reached out to another technical division and quickly returned with a solution.  He was professional, polite, knowledgeable and patient.  Rarely do I experience such exceptional customer service.  Well done!

<Time>1578271800061</Time><Text>Setting up system: Prompt, courteous response by emergency operators. Needed tech support; callback took a little while on a Saturday, but the tech was good and we did get things working right. Two disappointments, regarding equipment features:
1. Only the base unit has a microphone
2. Base unit speaker is painfully loud if you're in the room with it. According to the tech, it is designed to broadcast through the whole house, and volume cannot be adjusted.

These are not necessarily deal-breakers, but at least an optional package with remote buttons equipped with microphones and speakers would be worth something. My ears are still ringing.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

When I called in, my call was taken by Esmeralda. She was very understanding, personable, and found the best deal possible to save me money. her follow up via phone and email was exceptional! I genuinely feel she cared about my case. In short, Esmeralda was amazing!

I have high standards when it comes to protecting my elderly mother. I can say, without hesitation, that Bay Area Medical has met, and in some cases exceeded my expectations. There's never been an issue, and they're on the line quick when we test the system. I feel better knowing they're there at the press of a button, and so does my mom.

I would recommend Bay Area Medical to anyone  that's concerned about their elderly parents living alone. I now understand why they're rated #1 on several of the websites i visited during my research long ago.</Review>< Pics>

I HAVE BEEN WITH BAY ALARM FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND FEEL THEY ARE REALLY A GREAT COMPANY. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POLITE, CARING AND PROFESSIONAL. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE 5 STARS BUT THE RESPONSE TIME FROM SIGNAL TO ACTUAL ANSWER IS TOO LONG. A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN JUST SECONDS AND I FEEL BAY ALARM TAKES TOO LONG TO ANSWER. HOWEVER!! WHEN THEY DO ANSWER THEY ARE SO POLITE AND CARING, IT ALMOST MAKES YOU FORGET HOW LONG IT TOOK TO ANSWER!<//Text>

I've had to "Press My Button" several times because as the commercial shows,  when I fall I really can't get up. With two knee replacements and one hip replacement I'm unable to get up off the floor no matter what I try. The medics or ambulance drivers are fantastic, they are so pleasant and understanding and in 2 seconds I'm standing up. I would never be without my alarm system.<//Text>

I got a unit for home and was not comfortable with it's range, I needed more. I called customer service and discussed returning my purchase and replacing it with the GPS that would better fit my needs. I have to have fall detection and was assured that it is on the GPS. I am returning my original purchase for the GPS. The customer service person was so very helpful and very knowledge
able  about the products. Very happy with the outcome and looking forward to receiving my new unit<//review>

After exhaustive research and investigation we chose Bay Alarm Medical as a provider to keep our loved one safe. Recently, one of the remote devices battery ran low and Bay Alarm made sure we were aware of this, and contacted us via every contact method we had set up to make us aware of the situation. Now some folks might be put off at a perceived "over-communication" but when you have a loved one getting older, it is just not worth it to leave things to chance. We appreciate Bay Alarm for all they do for us, Thank You!</text>

<Review>Excellent service by Bay Alarm Medical. My mother was home alone and fell .  The pendant alarm around her neck worked perfectly.  EMTs were contacted, arrived on the scene, and her son was contacted as well

My only complaint is that Bay Alarm contacted all 5 persons on the emergency contact list, even though it reached the first person on the list and he said he would arrive at his mother’s house in 10 minutes.  Contacting everyone on the emergency list was unnecessary and caused needless panic.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>On 11/17/19, The City of Coconut Creek, Fl. had a power outage. The phones and electric were both out. My medical alert notified our paramedics, and they came within 5 minutes. The city restored power 10 minutes later. I called Bay Alarm and I explained what happened. We ran a test and all was well. Thank you Bay Alarm Medical.</Text>< Pictures>

Bay Alarm Medical provided us excellent equipment and service.  For the many false alerts, they acted professionally and promptly.  For the one real time we needed them, they were excellent and had  first responders on site within minutes.  And, they go the extra effort and notified all others in the phone tree that we had activated the alert.

Many thanks for the peace of mind you provided.<//review>

Got it opened it up had everything except.... how to set it up. There were no instructions. So I sent a message to have them email me. Got the instructions set it up. Tested it worked great. Tested all the extra 4 buttons worked great. Tested the necklace yeah it doesn't work. So now I have to call them again and see how long it will take to replace the one I have that doesn't work.

< Review>
After much research, I chose Bay Alarm Medical for my parents and have nothing but good things to say about our experience. Every service rep I spoke to was so patient, helpful, and professional. They were the same with my Mom who is hard of hearing. Set up was a breeze. My mom accidentally pushed her pendant button a couple of times and she was treated very kindly. The monthly fee is competitive with the other companies I looked into (better than many). I highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.</Review>

This system is rock solid. We tested the system yesterday and my moms eyes just shined. She feels safe and she knows help is only a click away. I know this sounds like I work for Bay alarm medical but they are on the other side of the US and I'm in Indiana.  The set up was plug and test that's it. I looked at other units but hands this is the way to go.</Review>< Pics>

Thankfully my mom never had to use it for any emergency but the couple times she accidentally hit the low set buttons with her walker, they responded quickly & were so kind.
We just moved mom to the nursing home but this service gave us all great piece of mind the last year she lived alone.
Thank you Bay Alarm Medical!< /Text>

This review rating is on the phone conversation only.  Until the actual alarm is pushed, we wouldn't know if the problem was taken care of or not.  The person on the phone seemed to take care of the things we ask about.  We could not figure out why the contact phone numbers form can't be filled out online.  The person here with the alarm would not be able to get to the base to cancel before 911 was called if a button was mistakenly pushed.  We didn't want the contact letter to take 3 to 4 days getting back to Bay Alarm Medical so when we called, we believe the emergency contacts were added so 911 wouldn't be showing up without reason.  I believe you should have a place to fill out the emergency contact list online so it goes into effect when the unit is put into service.< /text>

We used Bay Alarm Medical for 3 years when my grandmother was in her 90’s. It was a very affordable and reliable service. Customer service was always easy to work with. And when we needed to cancel because she had 24 hour care, there was no hassle like I had read about with other companies in which they wouldn’t let you cancel even if you loved one died. There were no long term contracts. Just month to month which is why I chose them.</text>

<Review>Bows and curtsies to Bay Alarm Medical for  steering me on the straight and narrow road into why I needed a home system and the Mobile GPS system.  I see my conclusion was wrong.  Also, the back ordered item was received, well within the time frame expected.  Your company has earned all the accolades received and like all first class companies its not the problem, its how it gets corrected.  I look forward to a long positive relationship.
***********************************************************************
Quite frankly I am very disappointed with the way this my transaction started out.  I went with the favorable 5 star reviews as my determining factor to go with Bay Alarm Medical.  I ordered the Home/Mobile GPS device and upon receipt of the unit a flyer was enclosed saying the Mobile GPS device was on back order and should be back in stock "in less than 2 weeks".  In my case I should have in on or before April 8, 2019. I should of been notified at time of order of this back order situation.

After reading the enclosed documentation I couldn't justify why do I need the home unit when the Mobile GPS device is cellular and I always have at least 4 bars of cellular signal in my home.  I asked the question to customer service and they tell me that you may not have cellular service in your home therefore the home unit would be more reliable.  I assure the rep that there are places outside around town that do not have a cellular signal as well and I think Bay Medical may be overloading its customers with unnecessary equipment and more importantly expenses.  As a side note I was told that once you are home you should remove the cellular pendant and replace it with the home pendant.  Then if you leave again replace the home pendant with the cellular one.

Finally, I will not activate the system until I receive everything I ordered and at that time I will decide what I will do.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1553703632114, 'text': "Hi Harvey - We sincerely apologize for the delay and miscommunication in your order as we experienced a back order in some of our popular products. We are happy to see that it looks like you will get the device by the end of the week. In regards to your concerns about Mobile GPS and the In-home system, we definitely do not overload our customers with unnecessary equipment. We would never want that as it wouldn't be good for the customer or our team if people had things they didn't need. The Mobile GPS is our on-the-go medical alert device, and while it can work in the home (depending on coverage),  the user will have to charge it and while its charging, they would not be covered with any sort of device. The In-home device does not need to be charged so, in your case, it can be used while the GPS is being charged. Depending on the customer's preference, people prefer to wear the small button rather than carrying the GPS around the house. As a reminder, the In-home button cannot be used during an emergency while you are away from home. Once you have everything, feel free to give us a call so we can help walk you through setting up and testing everything. Our Customer Service team would be happy to help! At that point you can then see how you feel about having both for in-home and away from home coverage. Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical"}<//response></record></dataset><record>

I found Bay Alarm in a Consumer Reports that explained the different services, options and costs.   I was able to bundle only the accessories and service my Mom needs and at the lowest monthly cost. I experienced why
Bay Alarm was listed in the Consumer Reports top 10. The report didn’t mention their Customer Service!  I made a mistake on my online order and needed to revise it.  I called their phone support and the correction was seamless!</Text>

We got this for my 93 year old mother in law because she lives alone. She has set the alarm off many times and like a well oiled machine we all get a call letting us know that the alarm went off, she didn’t answer when they called and the police and EMS have been dispatched.
Talk about peace of mind...this is it.</Text>

I have only been using the Bay Medical Alarm System for about three weeks now. I have to say at this point I am very pleased with their products and customer service. Their response times are excellent, and their tech and  customer service representatives go above and beyond being helpful in resolving any issues  that arise.  I currently have the GPS mobile device that I wear as a necklace when I am out and about,  and have the land line device with the necklace and bracelet that I wear at home. I like the fact that I can wear this necklace in the shower, so I always feel safe. The bracelet is worn at night while sleeping.</Text>

Have not had to use the alert system so I can’t speak to the response in an emergency. I wish the device was smaller. It quite large for hanging around the neck and is very obvious. Customer service has been good.</Review>

My mother used Bay Alarm's medical alert system for the past two years, faithfully wearing her pendant and thankfully, never needing to use it.
In all my contacts with the company, the representatives were friendly and efficiently managed whatever I had called to ask or have resolved.  Super easy/user-friendly system.  I highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical's customer service!</text>

Having the emergency alarm system for my 86-year old mother has been a comfort.  However, the other night, the pendant activated by itself and an emergency crew showed up to find all was well.  I slept through the whole thing, my mom handled the false alarm.  The folks at Bay Alarm helped me over the phone to reset my unit and call buttons. They were very helpful.  I hope this won't happen again!  Also, I don't know why the ER guy came through the window when they are supposed to get information on where the key is hidden.<//Text>

<Text>Service and attention has been excellent.  It would be better if their system was easier to deal with for those of us who have more than one home and move back and forth seasonally.  Having to call in each time and go through all the questions about contacts, etc. is a result of the inability of the system to store such data and retrieve it.  However, they are very service oriented and handle the changes smoothly and promptly.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Bay alarm helped keep my father in law home for five years, giving us the security of knowing that when he fell he would be just minutes from getting the help he would need to get back on his feet again. On the occasions he actually needed to be looked at for further medical intervention, that help was also just a button click away. Bay alarm alerted me right after calling emergency medical personnel, so I was able to be there within minutes. The pendant he had worked up to 300 feet from the base unit, allowing him the freedom to be out in the yard and still covered. He had no internet and no interest in learning new technology, yet this system was perfect for him. I would definitely recommend!< /review>

Telephone staff was very helpful and telephone line was open so I got someone immediately.
Just a suggestion:  You may want to make the print literature easier to understand by enlarging print and  pictures and putting names of each part next to it (instead of in a box below).
Keep directions simple. Basically, how do you charge it?  How do you activate?  How do you know it's charged or needs to go back on charger?</text>

<text>Bay Alarm Medical helped us with emergency care for my mother.  They were very conscientious about checking and helping us set up her equipment, and they sent help quickly every time we needed it.  Their hardware worked great.  It was affordable, and we did not have to sign a contract.  Knowing the service was month-to-month put our minds at ease. We really enjoyed our experience with Bay Alarm Medical.<//text></record>

I've had them for 5 years.  The service has been wonderful.  I've never needed to "push the button" intentionally, but a couple of time did it accidentally.  They called me immediately and were very gracious about my mistake.  It's given me peace of mind knowing that I could get help at the push of a button.</review>

Bay Alarm was quick to resolve problems we recently had with their monitoring equipment after a thunderstorm.  The equipment now works like new. Bay Alarm staff is always courteous, helpful and patient when we call them. I highly recommend this company and their services.< /Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Bay Alarm Medical has always been very responsive each time we have contacted them. However, we recently changed my mother's alarm to one with "fall detection", and it proved so sensitive, she could not wear it without accidentally making a call for help. We are returning the new personal call alarm and exchanging it for the original. Otherwise, very good service.</Review>< Date>

We were pleased with our initial talks with Bay Alarm. The unit tested well, and shoUK ld be a good safeguard in case of accident.

That having been said, their after sale communication response time needs improvement. Twice, because of long hold times I left a return call number, and neither time did I get my call returned.<//text>

My family arranged for Bay Alarm services after I returned from an unexpected hospital stay.

Fortunately, I never actually "needed" to the alarm but its presence has been a tremendous peace of mind to me and my concerned family.

The customer service people have been very gracious and helpful.

I am also impressed at the additional capabilities of my "command central" unit as it can be programmed to respond to other alerts, be set for reminder alerts (like taking prescriptions), and more.

It is my pleasure to recommend the Bay Alarm service to all people concerned about safety while living alone, or to those who want to help a loved one with a reliable safety check service.<//review>

The service seems to be fine although my Grandma has never had to use it thankfully but the website and accessing your account is a nightmare. My payments were 2 quarters late because I couldn’t log on and update my credit card information and I spent way too much time trying to fix it before I gave up figuring they would contact me when they didn’t get their money. They did, 6 months later and I had to pay for it all at once. I would definitely like to see an up to date website.</Text>

<Time>1559328273089<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>Very poorly trained telephone reps. We could tell they didn't know the product when asked simple questions about the product and the basic distance it works from. Nor did they know what the T/L button next to the reset button does. They also didn't know that tech only works day hours as they tried to transfer me at 8 PM EST. When we called tech next day, we were told not to worry about the T/L button as it wasn't important. Huh? We pointed out that the mediocre instructions did not mention or show the T/L button and its purpose. After repeatedly asking why there was a button so clearly present, the tech said "well, it is used for checking distance but you shouldn't worry about it." This is very poor from a number of directions, including the operating instructions and drawings showing the product. If there is a button, the button should be noted and described for its purpose. I'm not clear at this point as to the use of the button, so I would expect an email with an explanation as to its purpose and why you have failed to include it in the instructions. Thank you.

First rate service. Due to hurricane it had been awhile since a test and update. Had a great re-evaluation with your customer service representative. Bless y'all and Happy New Year.

Butch

Once again top notch service from your Customer Service Department. If 9 is great I give him an  11 !!

Although I think the product seems to be fine, we had an issue with my mother in laws base so I called and left a message to have them call me back.  (I did not select urgent, as the matter was not urgent) They didn't return my call until 3 days later!  Although the matter was not urgent it need require immediate attention since the base system was not working.  had my mother in law need to use the system to report a fall or issue she would not have been able to for more than 3 days..  that is not the type of customer service they reported to have.<//Text>

<Text>Mom came home from 3 1/2 months of recovery from a serious stroke.  We tested the pendant button and it worked perfectly.  She could clearly hear the response when she pressed the help button.  I am so relieved to know she can call for help or help will be summoned if a fall is detected and she cannot respond.<//Text>< GmapID>

The customer service rep was also very helpful in explaining to me that they will call EMS if I do not respond at all, after pressing my personal alarm.  Good to know this.

I bought this system for my older brother, who had previously had a medical  emergency.     He told me he would use it.    He didn't, and after I paid for it for 10 months,  he said he didn't want or need it.    I'm sorry I can't tell you exactly how well it works, but I think it is a great idea, and the wristband is a very convenient way to use it - much better than a pendant, in my opinion.
Bay Alarm was very responsive in letting me know several times that no test signals were received.    I would recommend this system very highly.<//Review>

I would rate Bay  Alarm Medical  a 5 for their interaction with their customers. Their personnel have been wonderful throughout the set up process. They have a extremely quick response to fall detention and are always friendly and helpful when they call.

The only reason I didn't give them a full 5 star rating is the written directions. They could be much clearer in explaining that when you are using the Caregiver Tracking app, you should the BAMA number where they ask for the account number. Also I found three account numbers for one device, counting the BAMA number.</text>

< Review>
I had put my faith (and my health) into the hands of Bay Alarm, all day, routinely, wearing the emergency (button) unit around my neck. Luckily, never had to use it to summon help, so far. Nonetheless, on two occasions, I heard three "beeps" coming from the unit. When telephoning Bay Alarm (sometime later) to inquire into these beeps' meaning, was told "never heard this before; cannot explain; call us immediately next time this happens". It happened again yesterday, and I did call Bay Alarm within 30 minutes to report; received pretty much the same response: "don't know". So, what's up?

In the same phone call, reported the lack of response (during a test) to my pushing the Emergency (SOS) Button. Your instructions state "hold ... for 3 seconds or until you feel it vibrates". I did the former and had zero response. I was then told to hold until vibration, and, eventually, was connected. That could cause a problem in a real emergency! Waiting three seconds may all one is able to do, thus, one misses the alternate call approach. Should that be corrected in your instructions?

Finally, I reported and questioned the purpose of the red Power Status LED light coming on. I was referred to  your instructions, namely, that the light comes on at 40% battery capacity.  It is my habit to charge my unit EVERY NIGHT at bedtime for the entire night, in expectation of always having power throughout the ENTIRE FOLLOWING DAY. Here I was advised that excessive charging could cause the battery to fail, and that THREE HOURS OF DAILY CHARGING would be sufficient. There is no mention of this in any of your instructions! Besides, after three hours, I am usually asleep, and would miss taking the unit off its charger. How much of an issue is that?

Please clarify. Little details do matter!</Review>

<text>At Bay Alarm the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. First off, I get this insensitive email entitled "Marie, tell us about your experience." Marie has been dead for 3 months.
We unplugged the box in the house and I shut down the account 2.5 months ago. I continued to get a stream of notes and warnings. I called back 5 times informing them I had shut down the account, the notes and warnings kept coming.
We sent the box back and knew when it arrived at their facility, unfortunately Bay Alarm took 3 weeks to figure out it had arrived at its facility after multiple calls.
Very frustrating at a time when we did not need frustration.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>
{'time': 1579905401116, 'text': "Hi John -\n\nWe are sorry to hear about your experience. We understand your family was going through a difficult time and simply wanted the account closed. To fully cancel, the equipment must be returned and processed, not just unplugged and powered down. During the holidays cancellation processes did take longer than usual and we apologize for the delay. We are glad to see our representatives were able to provide proper details and assist with getting the connection calls to stop. Looking at the account, we see that everything is fully cancelled and that a refund was processed for the unused time.\n\nWe'd like to apologize for the automated email assigned to Marie - The system pulls from the account, which her name was on but it was your email on the account - There was absolutely no intention of being insensitive or trying to upset you and your family. These surveys go out at random based on recent phone calls, as customer feedback is important to us and for employee acknowledgement. Again, we apologize for the less than satisfactory experience you had during this difficult time. We do hope that during the past few years of service, you and your family had peace of mind and that mom was safe and comfortable.\n\nPlease accept our warmest regards and condolences.\n\nAll the best,\nBay Alarm Medical"}</response>

Customer Service is always polite and responsive.  The only issue I have is that it sometimes takes a while when I call to test my button, usually on a Sunday evening, for someone to respond to "Calling for Help."  If it seems long when I have nothing wrong with me, I expect it would seem like an eternity if I really had a problem.</Review>

How did generations of families survive before Bay Alarm?

It is at least two years later. I called to update my billing information after losing my debit card.  Bay Alarm is a priority.  Jessica was friendly and courteous as she completed my business.

My 93-year-old mother has recently moved to Georgia to live with my niece.  I had planned to stay with Bay Alarm for the remainder of her life.  However, she is no longer home alone.  She is surrounded by much family.

<text>This company has been outstanding when we needed the alarm to work correctly 1000% of the time.

I live 2700 miles from my mother and my sister is an hour away, we felt so much better knowing if something was wrong, my mother was just a “button push” away from gaining help.

At one point an ambulance was needed and the system worked perfectly, they called for the ambulance and next called my sister.

Every single contact we had with this company we had very competent, caring and patient people answering our questions.

Even when the button was pushed by mistake, the Bay Alarm staff always stayed patient and kind.

I highly recommend this company to anyone who needs someone they love, and lives independently, to have this kind of security.< /text>< Rate>

I am delighted to write this enthusiastic endorsement of Carlos.  I am a complete novice at home alert systems, and he not only explained the concepts of in-home versus GPS monitoring with clarity and precision, he was enormously helpful in making the right decisions for my Mom.  He asked all the right questions... and with a caring concern!   Having such a knowledgeable and articulate representative was a delight and I am VERY IMPRESSED!

It was time to cancel my mother-in-law's contract and John was caring and supportive in helping me understand the options.  Excellent support staff... again.</review>

< Review>
I spent a long time on the phone going over the options for the medical alert for my father. We reviewed everything. I ordered the wristband for him instead of the lanyard and we discussed this at length. When it arrived yesterday, they sent me the lanyard. I called to have the correct item sent. The guy treated me like I was stupid. He asked me if the device I received was square with a button. I told him it is oval with a lanyard. I can tell the difference between a wristband and a lanyard. Do they think I would call if I’d received the correct item? We haven’t been able to try the service yet but this wasn’t a great way to start.<//Review>

Consistent friendliness and caring about why the alarm went off..be it a test or fixing power cord from monitor. When there was a power loss, we got many messages and even a call to local police/fire department and they came by, to my embarrassment but all is well. Thank you for your excellent customer service and competence. I feel much safer since mom is at home when I must be away because she is much safer....Paula Lin, Orange, CT</Text>

We purchased this product for our mother. The product was easy to setup and gave us peace of mind when our Mother was home alone. As her medical needs increased, we were glad that help was only a click away. She didn't carry her cell phone everywhere so this was a perfect supplement.</review>

The Bay Alarm Medical Service has been great! My mom lives across the street from me and I got this for her and for me.  I love that we can periodically test the equipment and that they always ask if we are okay when we use it.  The  customer service people have been very helpful when I've needed to call to change service or provide a new payment method.  The only thing I do not like, is the wrist band. It's made of a rough scratchy material, so it is not very comfortable to wear.  I made myself a cloth bracelet that I wear under the wristband to solve the problem.</review>

Bay Alarm has provided such a sense of security for both my parents and family. I was hesitant at first to suggest the service to my dad, but his response was "I've been wanting one of those!" Each time he has accidentally pressed his button, he has been treated with complete kindness and dignity. I highly recommend this service!< /Text>

I have only used my Bay Alarm accidentally, setting it off by pushing the button when I wasn't paying attention. The response from Bay was quick, comforting, and professional.  I was glad I had set if off.  My mistake demonstrated the professionalism of the service.  Should I ever need it in a real situation, I know it will work quickly and well.</text>

Just did our semi annual address update.  Easy Peasy.  The staff members that I dealt with were courteous and helpful.  The process was painless.  We had disconnected the system in Ohio and we had not yet gotten it set up for Florida. The computer called to make sure all was well.  Great service at a good price.  I highly recommend Bay Alarm to anyone who wants a loved one to feel safer.

Update:  I got a phone call this morning about a low battery on the fall alert necklace.  Easy to get a replacement on the way to my mother.  Again, wonderful customer service.< /review>

<review>I have always had GREAT customer service!!!! The reason for the lower score is that my mom complains the in home emergency button unit is too large. The only GPS unit they have to have coverage outside her home, is a pendant and it is quite large and my mom won't wear it. She wants a wrist unit.  Therefore, we are now  looking elsewhere.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My mother was hesitant about getting an alert system.  I researched our options and went with Bay Medical.  The system was easy to install and both times when my mother tested it a very polite and warm voice came over the speaker, addressed her by name, checked in, and encouraged her to try the system again if she felt she needed to.  Her response, " Oh wow, that was great.  He was like a REAL PERSON."  She meant "real person" in the old fashioned Jewish meaning which is more like, kind and thoughtful; the highest compliment my mom gives.  Peace of mind for her and for our family.  Nicely done!< /Review>< Pictures>

I had a technical question and called the tech line.  I was put on hold
and after waiting 28 minutes I finally gave up and chose the call-back
option.  I never received a call back.  (So that is a zero star experience.)
The next day I again called the tech line and my call was answered
immediately.  Further, the person who answered my call was polite
and helpful.  (So that is a five star experience.)  My 3-star grade above
is a lenient average.</review>

Mother is 89 and lives by herself.  There are no close neighbors, so recently when she needed help, Bay Alarm Medical assisted her in getting an ambulance quickly.    It's this type good service that gives the family comfort in knowing she can get help when needed.< /Review>

My father fell and Bay medical not only sent the wrong pendant but they never entered the contact information in case of emergency.  We called them and they NEVER CALLED us back.  I had to call them again to get the whole mess straightened out.  This could have been disastrous for my father.  So far I am far from impressed.< /text>

My phone call today to Bay Alarm was handled with professionalism, kindness and humor.  The customer service rep was able to handle my questions and requests promptly and we are able to handle the situation.  She was absolutely lovely.  Thank you!<//review>< gmap_id>

We are just at the starting gate. So far so good. Both tech support and the dispatchers were very courteous and thorough in helping us test the system and be sure everything is up and running.

This system is for my 95 year old Mother-in-law who lives by herself on her 5 acre property. I tested it out to the mailbox and over to the peonies where she regularly weeds. The range is great.

We dropped it to simulate a fall and it worked as expected. Since the mechanics work and the people provide courteous and thorough service I am very happy with our choice.

It is clear that Alexa, David and Esther (our phone support people) all know that a frail person is in their care.< /review>

< Review>
Our electric service went out, and Bay Alarm sent me an email to requesting us to test the unit for my mother.   We did test and found problems, I was able to call tech support and get the answer even though it was after 5pm on a Friday.   I managed to get her back online with the unit for the weekend.   It would have been nice if the reset could have been done remotely, but I was still pleased that they had notified me there could be a problem, and we got it fixed without disrupting service too much.</Review>

After doing some research on medical alarm companies for my elderly mother I found that a lot of them have sales people that are like sharks that won't let go when you call them and are only after your money.  Bay Alarm Medical will treat you well, answer your questions in a friendly manner and be there if you need them.  You will not be disappointed if you chose to do business with them.

<review>The rep I spoke with was thorough and knowledgeable.  She knew exactly what I needed and took control of the situation with a quick resolution.  Beyond that I am very impressed with the response time.  I was not expected to wade through auto-attendants again and again to get to customer service.  For that I especially thank you!</review><user_name>Judith Raske<//user_name>< UserId.>

I chose Bay Alarm because of others recommendations and the high marks for Customer Service which is, by the way, their main business. My choice was  affirmed today! The person on the phone very patiently worked with me assisting as I struggled to understand how to hook up their Alarm unit to my mother's cable modem. I so appreciated her patience, persistence, and kind tone on the phone while I sought to make the proper connections.  Together we prevailed and the Alarm unit works perfectly.

Representatives have been so friendly and accommodating even after my mom called and tried to change her account without understanding what she was doing. Ms. Hill was kind and patient and gently talked my mom down from an angry tirade with kindness and understanding which can be a huge challenge when dealing with older people sometimes. Their rates are very competitive and the service is first rate. All in all, I would def recommend them to all my friends and family.</text>

Just got first bill. They start charging you the day you order. Took 11 days to get this. So paying for 11 days for no service is stupid. So wonder your the cheapest you screw people this way.

Update.  They have corrected my billing</review>

Very responsive and understanding with accident alarms. The reason for 4 stars is I needed to temporarily suspend service and was told I would need to send equipment back. My mom was in the hospital and rehab so she didnt need services at this time but the company wasn't willing to do that.<//text>

<Text>The one time I needed to use the system, I was on the floor away from the desktop unit. I lost my necklace button nearly a year ago, asked for a replacement, but never heard back. So I ended up waiting two hours until my wife came home. She then called the local rescue service and they came and promptly helped me up. I vey much need the button to wear. But I don't think you respond to such requests, so I'm not getting my hopes up.< /Text><rate>1< /rate></record>

Our mother wanted to live as independently as she could but we wanted to make sure she would receive help in our absence if she fell or injured herself. There are a lot of companies that offer med-alert technology but Bay Alarm Medical offered the features we wanted AND the friendly, helpful support on the phone we craved. Every time I called, the agent listened patiently to my questions and answered them thoughtfully. Once the pendant and "alert box" that sits on the counter arrived, I called Bay Alarm Medical to ask if they could walk us through what would happen when Mom pressed the button. The agent stayed on the line with me (I called from my mobile so Mom's home phoneline was open) and then walked us through an actual call with the response team. I would recommend Bay Alarm Medical to any family trying to sort out how to care for aging parents.< /review>

The necklace is way to sensitive.  The button is flush with the top and goes off at the slightest touch.  I switched to the bracelet.  The alarm button is recessed.  It works great, but the strap is starting to shred.
When I have set off the alarm the response is perfect, the people are very courteous and professional and friendly.</Text>

My experience with Bay Alarm Medical, at this point, is purely online. I was looking for additional information for a family member. The associate that chatted with me, Kelly, was more than helpful.
She was informative, knowledgeable, quick to respond and had an amazing sense of humor. She was able to answer every single one of my questions with little to no delay and in a concise manner. She is an absolute asset to the company. If she is any indication of the type of people you employ, you'll have my business in an instant if I can convince my relative to put one of your devices on.</review>

With a variety of styles I selected the necklace.  In and out of the shower, the call button is completely waterproof with a quick dry cord that does not feel like a damp tie around your neck.

The unit is designed for a sturdy fit on any furniture.  Small and compact yet
with a "can't miss" HELP button.

Placing a "test" call once a month is answered promptly by an agent speaking clearly and distinctly.  The rapid response is not disconnected until the agent verifies who the caller is, purpose of the call and urgency.

I explain I am testing and no other problems.  A very courteous agent determines call is resolved before the disconnect and reset.

Bay Alarm Medical works for me.<//text>

My monitor seems to be on and "healthy" at times and then needs attention at other times. One of your team told me he'd take it off test while I was away for four days.
What I'd like to do if to have the monitor that doesn't connect to a phone line. I think my phone line is causing the problem but cannot be sure.

However, if I could be sent a monitor that needs only an electric power line, I think I wouldn't have the problem with it that I seem to be having with this monitor. I still have the boxes my equipment was sent in.

Please let me know your decision when you get an opportunity to.
Thank you, Marilyn Barton
PS my main landline is a wall phone and my  phone line has a split line so can't use that one.<//review>

<Review>Bay Alarm and the devices associated with it have been a great tool in helping my Dad keep his independence.  He has had to press the alert/alarm button a couple of times and Bay Alarm has notified us quickly.  The company is proactive in the monitoring as well.  The device that connects to the land line was malfunctioning unbeknownst to us.  They contacted us to check that it was OK.  It was not - they sent a new one out.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The person that I spoke to today was very helpful, took her time, and answered all of my questions.  I was calling to make some contact changes to my mom's account.  I also had some questions as to how the system worked.  I was very satisfied with the phone call and the person who helped me.  Bay Alarm Medical has been very responsive when my 91 year-old mom has needed help.  My family is very satisfied and would highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.<//Text>

My calculations and the customer service person were not in agreement on it. I’m trying to figure out what I might have missed on my end of things, but I’m having trouble locating what I need to do so. I’m disabled and every penny counts for me each month. I hope I can figure this out so I can afford it and not have to send it back to y’all.

Thank you,

Very courteous staff.  Easy to order and easy to set up.  Happy with the system.  After deciding I know longer needed it, they were very gracious about my returning it with no problem.  In the future, if I ever felt I needed an alert system again, I would definitely order another from Bay Alarm.< /Review>

I called today to make sure the alarm was set up correctly and prepared for my fathers use.  Everything worked as described and the technical support person insisted that we test it before I hung up with him.   We tested the unit while he sat in the background listening.

Great experience -</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>If not sure how their alarm service is, but their delivery svc is TERRIBLE! They told us it would ship the same day we ordered it and would take 5-7 days. 10 days later they said it shipped on time. 11th day they said it was back ordered and never shipped, but we would get it the next day. We still have NOT received it! Tracking says tomorrow, but we’ll see. I need to sleep knowing my 86 year old dad can push a button and get help! What bothers me the most is the lying. Now I feel I can’t trust them to answer when my dad needs help!!!! Scary.
UPDATE: We got it! It’s easy to use. Response times were great when we tested it! We feel good about his future security with Bay Alarm!</text><userid>105443335738121815145< /userid>< Resp>

In the interim, another person patiently helped me understand what I needed to do.- to make the connection happen.  It was fortuitous because he was able to realize that the unit was defective- my voice wasn't heard from about 2 feet away from the unit.
He was knowledgeable and he will act to replace the monitor and also send the gps unit.

< Review>
Have used Bay Alarm service for my elderly dad for over 2 years now.  He has worn the pendant and also had the manual alarm button to use with one touch.  Over this time he has activated his alarm multiple times, including several falls in which his pendant sensor alerted the Bay Alarm to call, and subsequently send EMS.
This company is awesome .  Their phone operators are courteous, experienced and extremely proactive in providing prompt attention and follow through to ensure my dad's safety.
I highly recommend Bay Alarm to anyone considering for an elderly loved one.< /Review>

Shipment took awhile to receive. No necklaces and I am sending you 5 back. The large button on the wrist is too big and does not fit me well and the material is horrible and does not dry quickly from the shower.  I don't like the machine versus the old one and I had to pay someone to hook it up and I might have to move. Sincerely, D. Ludwig< /Review>

Very pleased with everything involved to set my 94 year old mother up the Bay Alarm Medical. The agent I spoke with on the phone was knowledgeable, helpful, and very patient in answering my questions. The device arrived quickly and was very easy to set up. All the contact agents during the setup process were also polite and patient, outlining expectations in an easy to understand manner. Shortly after setup, my mom experienced a power outage. She called and asked me whether the system was still working. I told her to press the Help button and they'd respond in a matter of seconds. And they did! She was very pleased that they were so quick and very helpful in explaining that she was still safe even if the power went out.What a great company - so glad we chose Bay Alarm Medical!<//Text>

All was good after I finally got a human on the phone.  I say finally because it took a very long time to get someone to answer.  Wait times were unacceptable for a service we are paying for, I'd say.  The billing folks would not even let you hold--you had to leave a VM.< /Text>

Bay alarm medical has been a great company, they have saved my dad several times when he has fallen while living alone. They were fast and efficient, they got the ambulance to his home quicker than I could get there, very pleased with this company.</Review>

Karina was perfect to work with...she made it so easy to reinstate my subscription and bring some of my information  up to date.  She was kind but totally businesslike.  She was patient.  And she had a sense of humor when i cracked some of my  jokes.  Well done, Karina!< /review>

< Review>
I can think of twice in 18 months of service when my Mother's medical device literally saved her life. After my parents mobility declined my sister moved closer to their house so she could help with various tasks and assist in traveling to and from medical appointments. But we wanted a little more 24hr support without intruding on my parents' privacy. I did some research and based on several factors chose Bay Alarm.

The best example I can give of the service you can expect is, my parents have a gated driveway, but there is a service vehicle entrance to the right. After attempting to contact someone to open the gate and being unsuccessful, Bay Alarm informed the medical team of the entrance. Thankfully they were able to get to my mother's aide in time because of the readiness of Bay Alarm and the time they took to ensure they understood the lay of the land and what difficulties they might encounter.

The other time my mother recalled often was when she fell in the shower. We had the waterproof unit in the shower. When she fell she was able to press the button and Bay Alarm was able to contact my brother, who was just around the corner. No need for an ambulance, and my mother did not have to worry about being rescued by strangers ,naked in a bathtub.

Well worth every penny.< /Review>

<review>Online help was great  -  answered all my questions, and provided me the details I needed to make my decision.  The website did not allow me to place my  order, so I had to call to place order  -  not a big deal, but not sure why the website did not work ?  Customer should be able to select a package, and any accessories, and get a total  -  this would make for a simple transaction.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I ordered a Bay Alarm Medical Alert necklace for my mom. I explained to the salesperson that my son was going to be with her for Mother’s Day. My mom would need help to install the alert in her home, so it was great that he could be there.  I paid $39 for expedited shipping so that it would be received in time. It never arrived! When I called to check on the delivery, I found out that it had not been shipped?  The company admitted that this was their mistake, but that did not help my problem. Unfortunately my son had to return home before the Alert System arrived. Now I need to find someone who can help set up the system.<//Text>

<Text>Totally pleased and satisfied with all of the components of this alarm system and the respect and patience that was exhibited by the personnel in setting up the equipment.  I look forward to excellent use of this alert system.  To date I have not had to use it, but am sure if I need to there will be someone there for me.  My two daughters have expressed their relief that I will be well taken care of in an emergency.

Bay Alarm came through for me even when I made a dumb mistake and got me on the right path again with up to date equipment and services.  Thank you Bay Alaarm.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< Name>

I ordered several types of monitoring equipment for my mom after her stroke.
Thankfully, we've only had to rely on the system once but it performed exactly as advertised and lived up to the expectations.

I've had a few problems getting all the devices working and synced with the right apps. That is the only advice I give to Bay Alarm Medical:  consolidate your tracking apps!</Review>

<text>I called yesterday to see if they could remove the fall detected feature.
It is way to sensitive,  going off even if it lands just a few inches on a very soft surface  such as a towel.
I asked  the young lady about removing it.  She said they could and put me on hold for twenty minutes and never returned!  I never received a return call either!
Not happy.
I will call again.<//text>< Pics>

The device was so sensitive that every time my husband simply brushed his arm it went off and we got the immediate call for help.  The immediate call was impressive; however, we returned the device because my husband quit wearing it.<//review>

{'time': 1566227642760, 'text': 'Hi Diane - Thank you for your feedback. It looks like on the last call our representative was able to assist with the account promptly in regards to the cancellation, and he also advised there was no money owed as the next bill date has not passed yet. If you are unsure and still have concerns regarding the account and billing, please give our Billing Team a call and we would be glad to assist you and clear anything up. We are sorry to hear the service was spotty at times, this can happen due to the local AT&T Network towers in your area, but our Tech Support team is available for any help and support. We will bring your feedback to our team to ensure we look into this and continue to work on improvements where necessary.\n\nAll the best,\nBay Alarm Medical'}</resp>

Quick to get your business...But only give credit when unit is returned.  Had a month paid for not refunded?  Still had not closed account until contacted.  Service was spotty at times...I would look for another service before using again.< /Review>

They still charged for 6 months after I cancelled and returned the equipment. THEN, after a a bit of back and forth they finally said they'll refund the 6 months but then had to charge $75 for a little house paint that was on the cord of the unit!! Based on the pics they sent me I could scrape the paint off with my fingernail. I have since filed a complaint with the BBB (Better Business Bureau).<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<username>John Sallee<//username><time>1553131067508<//time><Review>John was very helpful in helping me determine why the alarm was triggered so many times by accident.  My mother has a fall detector she wears around her neck.  Today she decided to lie on the sofa for a while.  This of course triggered the alert.  But she didn’t know.  John was able to determine which device triggered the alert and the times.  With that information it was easy to isolate the cause.< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

Every time I need to call Bay Alarm to pay my bill or give them updated credit card information I wait on the phone for up to 25 minutes and then I hang up. The only way I get a real person on the phone is to push the customer service option. I feel this is very unacceptable.
The product itself is good.<//text>

My alarm was falsely triggered twice in the past 24 hours, the second incident around midnight!  Each time the fire engine arrived.  Embarrassing.
So late at night I finally got Mission Control to switch off the system. This took time as there was some protocol involved that complicated matters.
As to personnel responses:  they were most helpful throughout the whole affair.  In particular I would mention Shaun in the technical department at 0800 on a Sunday morning.- understanding, and very capable. A real pleasure to deal with.< /Text>

From my first call and several more, every single person has been very welcoming and extremely patient with me. I changed my system, absolutely no problems. They allowed me as much time as I needed to get myself comfortable with everything.
Very professional.
I am glad I made this choice with so many available.</Text>

We are very satisfied with Bay Alarm Medical. Fortunately my mother has only needed to use it one time since we installed it.  My mom wears her necklace faithfully. She recently fell outside on the porch and was unable to get up. She pushed the button to engage the alarm. However she was unable to hear the tech from Bay Alarm speaking to her.
The tech called the persons listed on the account and explained that she was not answering him. The rescue squad was sent to my mom’s house. Thankfully she was ok and did not need to be taken to the hospital.
My brothers and I are very glad that we purchased this device for my mom. It gives us peace of mind that when we are not around, help is near if she needs it.

Every time I have contacted Bay Alarm the representatives have been caring, courteous, and very helpful.</text>

I've just signed up today, so to post a review of the products is too early.  I will say that Eduardo was wonderful to deal with on the phone and very smartly got the process set up.  He was very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions.

So now we are a year into the service and it's been wonderful.  Fortunately, we've not needed emergency services, but we are prepared for it.  My mother wears the medallion around her neck and feels very secure in knowing we are a button push away.  We test the service every couple of months.  What's the price of comfort and low anxiety?  She wants to live alone and keep her independence and we've done that for her.  Bay Alarm, we thank you.< /Review>

< Review>
At approximately 4:25 this morning I was awakened to emergency vehicles in front of my house and in my driveway.  When I looked out to see if a neighbor had an emergency, I realized a fireman was coming to my door!  Before he could open the lock box for a house key, I opened the front door.  He asked if I had an emergency as they had been alerted by Bay Medical.  I assured him there was no emergency and I had not pushed my alarm bracelet or the HELP button by my bedside.  He confirmed that the green light was on, not red if it were an emergency.

After apologizing to them for the false alarm, I called Bay Medical to find out what happened.  Technical personnel would not be available for several hours so I called later in the morning.  They could offer no explanation for the false alarm or why I had not received a call from Bay asking if I had an emergency.

In the initial stages of setting up a Help Call Button for my mother-in-law and needed an issue resolved by Customer Service. Talked with Rico and was very impressed by the way he handled the problem. Everything got resolved and I was left with a feeling of confidence in the organization.</Review>

You ask them to change your billing date, they say they will but never do, even though they charged you extra to do so.  Any more attempts to charge my card will result in a swift chargeback.  I'm done playing games with this company.</Review>< pictures>

{'time': 1578086030365, 'text': "Hi Michael - Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear you are unsatisfied with the billing experience. To clarify we do not charge anyone's credit card whenever we feel like it. We charge the card based on the billing date, which was agreed upon purchased and signed on the service agreement. We are very transparent about how our billing works, which is actually a simple auto-pay. Furthermore, we don't charge any fees to change billing information, details, etc. Again, we are sorry to hear about your frustrations and any confusion regarding the billing and payment of your account. Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical"}</Response>

<Text>This company is sensible and efficient. The monthly price is low and there is no contract to tie you into payments after you no longer need their services. I needed a new bracelet device and was sent one without charge. I highly recommend their service!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Bay Alarm nit from 2014 stopped working July 7, 2019.  Called customer service and explained situation.  The young man taking the information explained that, as a courtesy for being a customer since 2014, there would not be any charges for a new alarm unit.  The unit would come with a surge protector - also at no charge.
This was my first call to Bay Alarm's customer service and I can honestly say I was very pleased with the service I got from their representative.  I highly recommend Bay Alarm.

<Text>Very happy with the Bay Alarm Medical Alert system for my Mom! I am notified by e-mail anytime the unit gets unplugged, for some reason : )
This will be the 2nd year with it and everyone is always so helpful and very nice. When my Mom has pushed the button on alarm system by mistake, someone is immediately talking to her and making sure she is ok!  The one time it was needed to call someone to go over and check on my Mom, it all went very smoothly. This alert system is wonderful! A great piece of mind. Thanks to all the folks at Bay Alarm Medical!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Customer service great! I received a duplicate shipment and had to pay $8.60 postage due. Received shipping label and sent package back.  I assume I lost my $8.60 because of their mistake.  I still have a week till I can cancel, see what happens?</text>

Tre was very helpful getting us set up with the alarm system we wanted. All our questions were answered completely and in a timely manner. We are comfortable that we selected the best medical alert system for my mother who lives alone. Reasonable operating cost, no hidden fees, and plenty of options to get the exact coverage we need. Thank you Bay Alarm!<//review>

I was impressed with how quick and easy it was to set this unit up. Response time during testing was fast. My relative did not have to press the help button during the time we had the unit, and then she could no longer remain at home, so our experience was short-lived. However, the unit and company behind it impressed me.</Review>

MY experience with Bay Alarm so far has been excellent.  I received the equipment in a timely manner.  I'm am "technology challenged" and had some difficulty getting everything set up and operational.  I called the Bay Alarm help number and reached an actual REAL person!  I had more than one problem, and each time the Customer Rep was very helpful, patiently going over things in a simple way, so I could completely understand and complete the necessary procedure.  I look forward to a healthy, safe future with this Company.</Review>

This system is easy to set up and works great! Everyone at Bay Alarm Medical is very helpful, professional and extremely nice.  We purchased this system for my Mom and it has given me great peace of mind. She works outside in the yard a lot and it works great even when she's in the yard. My Mom has accidentally pushed the button on her wrist band a couple times and the staff, that talked to her, were so friendly and polite to her! I can't say enough good things about this Alarm system and the people who help with it. They are like angels on a phone line!< /text>

Bay Alarm has provided me with peace of mind in providing affordable service for my 92 year old mother over the past year and a half.
My mom has recently moved from her long-time Home in California into our guest house in Arizona.
I thought it would be difficult to set up the service in a new State, but it couldn’t have been any easier. The customer support team member was helpful and we were all set up in just a few minutes.
Thank you Bay Alarm for providing excellent customer service and support.</Review>

Bay Alarm is a great company to have my Medical alert with, Thankfully I have not had to use it so far. Just having it is a great comfort. I wish I could get the GPS feature in one item.  when I had the GPS also I found that I was forgetting it at home when I traveled so I cancelled it.< /Text>

I'm impressed by how conscientious the Bay Alarm staff are.  Today, our power went out for an hour or so, and Bay Alarm called me to be sure my husband was ok.

Power had come back on, so he was fine,  but they checked because the alarm might not have worked properly.

Thanks for the good service!

After much research, I chose Bay alarm Medical. I was super impressed with their product. My older parent had no intent of participating or wearing the device so I returned it. I found their customer service representative super helpful and the return process was easy. I am hopeful that, at a later date , we will revisit this and try again.< /text>

<text>My original call was a good one, but however, I wasn't properly informed of the different equipment or what was required for the equipment. The equipment that was sent was then no able to work as my mother doesn't have a land line. After all of this, my mother also doesn't live in area with stable cell coverage so she was not able to use the service.<//text>< Pics>

After I set the equipment up we pressed the emergency button to test response time, 43 seconds. I was told by the sales person online that your 2 year average was 10 seconds. Also, even though I was speaking clearly and fairly loud, your responder was not getting half of what I said and was complaining about the signal breaking up. We tried again and got a little better 31seconds with no complaints from your operator about the signal.< /Text>

We completely understand every second counts and in an emergency [for anyone], time seems very long. This is why we pride ourselves in being able to connect with loved ones so quickly and our average response time is still 10 seconds. Although we cannot control the phone lines/connections, we do our very best to connect in 60 seconds or less. We see that one of our representatives were able to successfully test the system with you and all is working well. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to give us a call and we are happy to assist you. Lastly, we do run our own weekly test on the connection of your system, but we still advise customers to test your button(s) at least once per month to ensure everything is working on your end.

<text>Customer service and their call center(s) have been excellent.  After 3 months I did run into an unexpected snag which I'm not happy about.  Their technical help service appears to only be open during their office (banker hours).  When you do a monthly test and things don't work, I expected technical help 24/7.  Seems important to me.  Well, that isn't true.  All I ever got was an answering machine for two days.  I didn't leave call back info; thought they should answer.  I hope this is a very temporary problem, but something to check on before signing up:)<//text>< pics>

Bay Alarm Medical is awesome. We use them for my parent's security and peace of mind. On one occasion my credit card was stolen and so the payment was returned. Rather than affect the service provided to my parents, they contacted me immediately to ask for a new method of payment. This is actual customer service, often a rarity in the world today. We will continue to be customers now and in the future. Thank Bay Alarm Medical!</review>

<Text>I ordered this alarm on April 23rd for my 91 year old mother. As of to date 5/14/19 I have not received the device. I phoned them and they stated they were expressing another device, I still have not received the express one either. In the meantime my mother is w/out the device that is very much needed. We have found another service to use, already have the device and is in place and in use.
Thanx, but no thanx.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I assist my elderly aunt, who lives alone, to make a test call each month with the Bay Medical Alert. We always get a prompt, courteous response. Today the phone line in her home did not clear, but an attendant called back to see if there was a problem and instructed me very clearly in how to reset the unit. Very pleased with the service.<//review>

I have lost my gps medic alert and after looking for days I decided to call for a replacement.  The woman that answered the phone was very efficient and helpful.. she assured me that I would receive the replacement and that it would be an upgrade!  She was so professional and calm it calmed me down..
I called my sister and told her it was like winning the lottery!  Receiving a replacement and such a polite, kind rep!
I readily promote Bay Alarm ... in this competitive business customer service makes the difference!
Thank you Bay Alarm,

I was having two issues. I had received a fraudulent phone call stating that my alert company had gone out of business and that they would call back with how to get my refund! I talked with your customer service representative, Esmerelda , and she was so helpful and professional. She reported it right away. She also helped me with the second issue with the base unit and how to fix it myself. She stayed on my cell phone with me through the entire process and did not hang up until sure all was in working order</Review>

We had ordered this as a gift for my mother, a home monitoring service after a series of falls. We chose this service over others because of the website’s claims of ease of use and no contracts.  My mother and her boyfriend were NEVER able to get this system appropriately installed in her home, even after several people came in to assist with installation. Also I ( as the contact person for emergencies ) got repeated calls that a monthly test on her system was needed. This couldn’t be performed because it wasn’t functioning correctly, but even if it had been, I was not in possession of the device to do said test! After one year of hit and miss service, and multiple calls from my mother for assistance with this problem, she asked that I cancel her monitoring. I contacted Bay Medical and was told that if the equipment was not received by a certain date we would be charged for another year of monitoring to our card on file! This was not the original agreement and was, in fact, why we went with this company to begin with. We mailed our equipment back in the original box and it was received the day before we were to be billed ( confirmed by USPS tracking number). However, I was still charged the next day for another year of monitoring.
We were not impressed with either the service we received from this monitoring or with the overall experience as a whole. Hopefully ours was an isolated case and others will have better outcomes for such an important safety feature for their family member.
After our cancellation, a representative did contact me via email to ask how to improve service and request to discuss theses issues with me. I have been unable to reach out to her yet due to the holidays.<//Review>

Purchased this system for my mom when she began falling often. She is a parkinson's patient and had also began showing signs of dementia, I ordered the pendant with fall detection and its a good thing I did since she couldn't think to press the button on her wrist button. One day she fell 4 times in a 12 hour period, she was never injured, her falls were more of a slow motion slide or toppling but she couldn't get up on her own. Luckily the paramedics station was only a quarter mile away and were usually coming into moms house while i was on the phone with the bay alarm representative who always called to let me know when paramedics had been dispatched. This is an awesome service unfortunately my moms condition deteriorated so quickly that she has moved into a care facility but I highly recommend this system for anyone who is a fall risk.</review>

This company has  excellent customer service reps!  They are knowledgeable, patient and extremely helpful in explaining how things work, and the cost of each add on feature.  Our Rep  was Alyssa Hermosillo and she was efficient, knowledgeable and extremely patient in explaining & answering our questions. She provided a brochure, pricing chart & information immediately to us - others were evasive re pricing, or did not have a current brochure to give us- if for no other reason this place impressed me with their customer service, but they offer a complete line that makes us feel is the best in the industry- combined -they are outstanding!  We made 3 separate calls & Alyssa immediately remembered our previous calls so we did not have to repeat ourselves.  Thank you!< /review>

Called to update my mother's new phone number and was on hold for over 40 minutes, when they finally answered  customer service said I had to call a different number and placed me on hold for fourteen minutes, they finally transferred me to a new extension and again I had to hold for over twelve minutes, I explained that I needed to update our new phone number and they told me that i needed to do it on line, Very frustrated...
Went on line, there is no link to register and the forgot PW link does not work. Still have not been able to update the new phone number.
Terrible Customer service!

<Text>Most excellent service always.
My father was 91 and still living alone when he started falling down. One morning when I arrived at his home, I found my dad on the floor bleeding from the skin tears on his arms. He had been there several hours. Before help had arrived, I convinced him to try Bay Alarm Medical.
Every experience with Bay Alarm was a good one. From setting up the system, to customer support for testing, and most importantly the Emergency Responses.
Unfortunately, my father needed to use the emergency "push button" necklace on more than one occasion. He received prompt and professional care every time! The dispatcher called everyone on the call list each time there was an emergency. They followed the outlined procedures to perfection each time.
My father has now agreed to move to an assisted living home where he will no longer require Bay Alarm Medical's services. I recommend this company to everyone. Fantastic service for my loved one, PRICELESS! Thank you Bay Alarm Medical.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Bay Alarm was reasonably priced. I had it for my 92 mother that lived alone. A few times paramedics were dispatched and response time was great. Mom
Had the button and always wore it and she felt secure knowing help was just a touch away.<//text>

Phone support was good; however, I had to call support today because I received an automated notification via email, which stated “AC loss signal loss received from your medical alert console 3/31/2019 at 8:05 am.  We are unable to make telephone contact or leave a message with you or your call list.”

No one from Bay Alarm Medical made any contact to me or my call list, and if I hadn’t checked email, I would have had no idea system was down.  I know you can’t prevent AC failures, but if system not working, you should at least call someone on call list.  In short, my 91 year old mother did not have system access until I received the email and called support and did system reset.  If your system fails for any reason I expect to be contacted immediately.  Please take necessary steps to keep my business with Bay Alarm Medical.<//Text>

Thank you so much for your efficiency during the sign-up with Bay Alarm Medical.   You helped me set up service for my 90-year old father and his elderly wife who live in another state;  your staff made the process quick and painless.  I especially appreciate your website.  The videos provided so much information, both for me and for siblings in another state who will be setting up the system for my father.  I'd like to encourage those people who are considering Bay Alarm Medical to take the time to review the appropriate videos as they answer typical questions,  discuss paperwork and billing,  and provide easy-to-follow installation instructions.< /Text>

< Review>
All you really need is the wrist bracelet (and in-home help button device that comes with it). These devices work as intended.

The auto fall function on the necklace doesn't work properly. I doubt another company does auto fall detection better. It seems like an underdeveloped technology.

Bay Alarm's customer service is very good as long as you call (via phone or help button) or utilize chat via their website.

Only other complaint is that they don't turn off the auto reminder on their contract even after you respond via email asking them to do so. I never asked for a contract and they don't require one to be signed. Cancellation is easy. No fees as long as you return the equipment. UPS makes this easy. Bay Alarm is a trustworthy company.

* Edit in response to Bay Alarm's reply * The equipment was already returned and every bill paid.  The auto reminder is not for a bill. If you re-read above, I wrote that the auto reminder is for a contract that wasn't required prior to service beginning. I never requested the contract / auto reminder and it is still on. This is meant as constructive advice to help make your business better, because it is a good and important one.< /Review>

I having been thinking about ordering a Medial Alert for my father for the past several days.  My father has a friend who has an alert by Bay Medical and is very happy with it.  I was convinced because I was told "how easy" it is to set up and use.  Trish made my phone call effortless and she was a delight to work with.  I already feel better about my father's safety!  I look forward to receiving this product for my father.<//Text>

<review>Would rate less than 1 if available. Been a customer for 3 years. Been paying extra for "fall detection". Each time elderly mother (91 y/o) w/Parkinson's fell, the system did not detect. Their excuse was "she slid down she didn't fall hard enough". Finally, when I was home to observe, the falls, they were significant-cracked ribs, blood spewing from forehead, etc.,  yet no detection. Only time I got a response from the monitoring company was when button on necklace was pushed accidently. Been paying $406 p/yr. What a waste. Don't purchase this system for your loved one.<//review><user_id>100688896681827457849</user_id>< Pics>

This system has worked great for my family. My grandma used hers once when she was having trouble breathing and it turned out to be a heart attack. She was able to get medical attention fast and it saved her life. Later I called to transfer the system to a different relative and customer service was very helpful. Made the process very easy.< /review>

< Review>
A solid service for safety issue, but many problems on the billing side of the operation. My sister continues to receive overdue notices, despite having the account set up for auto-payments via credit card, as well as two phonecalls and email to the Billing Dept. Seems to be a systemic problem. I normally do not post negative reviews, but Bay Alarm sent me an email asking for a review after the multiple communications with them to get the billing straightened out -- then yet another erroneous overdue notice arrived, and this  a day after I received the email confirmation of the latest monthly payment. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. I though others should be aware of this weakness in the service. We have been frustrated by this for the last 3 months and are looking into changing service to another provided.<//Review>

<text>We had a brief experience with Bay Alarm Medical, sadly, but everything in our two months was very positive. Their people are friendly and helpful, we received their equipment quickly, and setup was very easy. My mother had to use the service once, and everything went just the way it should have. We would have continued using them, but she needs onsite medical care now and cannot live independently. We are still grateful for the additional time she had at home, and it would not have been possible without this service. Thank you!< /text>< Pics>

Our only complaint is that as much as the monthly fee is, a replacement necklace shouldn't cost so much.  Batteries eventually fail, and as these are not user serviceable, a bit over $60.00 with the shipping included seems high.< /review>

Very Helpful customer service rep. I had tons of questions and she answered all of them to my satisfaction!  The only reason I'm leaving a 4 instead of a 5 star is because the company does not provide "fashionable" alarm buttons, but the customer service rep did state that they are working on a more glamorous set!</text>

<Review>The systems works well but the administrators are very difficult to work with. We had set up certain procedures to follow if my mom called and also follow up in writing but Bay Alarm only follow them half the time and cost us a lot of money with medical responses. Also the management tells you one thing to get you in and doesn't follow-up with there people to see if they can do what we asked, SO I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND them to anyone. But gave them two stars because did work sometimes and my mom is safe luckily.</Review>< user>

The Mobile GPS Help Button does not work in my neighborhood although at purchase I was told that it should.  The 30 free trial period is nice but they don't tell you that if you want to return it you must pay the return postage including a recommended return receipt which increases the cost.  I currently have their in-home system which I will be replacing and couldn't recommend to anyone.</review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>International family/Caregivers BEWARE!!
The gps app offered by Bay Medical is NOT for use by caregivers/family members located outside of the US...you have no visibility for the gps location of your Loved one. The app is advertised on their web, but never mentions geographical restrictions. Online chat support and telephone Customer Service really tried to help but poor souls have not been educated enough to know the apps limitation when you contact them.  As I was told...they were still getting the kinks out.
Maybe with a future update to your app I will be able to update my rating someday, but until then, Bay Medical, please feel free to reach me if you want to do testing with your app outside of the US. Its a pity it took trial and error on a live Customer to make the realization that your app is all US-centric.</text>< Pictures>

Bay Alarm has always been there when we needed them, no matter what time of day or night.  Even wen we accidentally punch the button, - they are very understanding and treat us old folks with the courtesy and kindness  we would expect from such a first class business.

Thanks Bay Alarm.

<resp>None< /resp><text>I have occasionally tested my button with good results. Today I pushed the button to test it and heard the message to "wait a minute" and after several minutes the phone link hung up. Then, while I was talking to a tech on my cell phone, my local 911 respondent phoned to see if I needed them. The tech and I went through a process to ensure I am online with Bay Medical again. I'm all right with this but it was jarring.</text><name>Judith Johnstone</name><Time>1553213580878< /Time>< UserId.>

My interactions with Bay Alarm Medical always have been exemplary!  Today I need some information regarding billing so I could request reimbursement from my mother's long term care insurance company.  I spoke with Esmeralda and she was quick to understand my needs an knew how to resolve my request.  The smile on her face came through in her voice.
I received the information I needed within minutes via email -- exactly as requested!!<//text>

I called Customer Service because there was a mistake in the type of equipment that had been shipped -- the result of some confusion about what equipment was required for which additional services.

Long story short ... the Service Rep I spoke with was friendly, knowledgeable, courteous in explaining what had gone wrong, readily proposed the practical solution to get things sorted out, and made herself available for a later call-back to confirm what next steps Bay Alarm would take to resolve the problem -- and what steps I'd need to take to close the loop.  IMHO, absolutely EXCELLENT customer service !!</Text>

I followed the instruction-pressed and hold the Help button for 1 second and i heard the announcement "placing an emergency call now. to cancel the call please press and hold the help button for two seconds." I held the button two seconds immediately and the device said that "your call has been canceled". It never went through a dispatcher. 15 minutes later, an ambulance came and asked me if I had placed a 911 call. Then I realized it could be because of the test so it automatically placed a 911 call for me. Before i ordered the device, i googled that it would connect to the dispatcher before calling an ambulance for the client. Since an ambulance was called on my behalf, now I would expect a $500 ambulance bill from the fire department! THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH!< /Review></record>

<user_name>Sandi Conley< /user_name><Time>1468934876607< /Time><rating>5<//rating><review>Our family purchased Bay Alarm medical alert for our mother who is in her nineties.  We did a lot of research and I was so surprised by the huge difference in cost for the same service.  I called one place that wanted about $300 to come and set up your system and $98 a month after that!  It was the first place I called.  Thank goodness I found Bay Alarm!  Set up was simple.....took about 5 minutes and we were ready to go.  They even have a YouTube video showing how to set up.  We tested it, and it worked fine, except my mom couldn't hear the person very well.  I talked to the bay alarm person, and she did something that made her voice come in much clearer.  Then Mom could hear it better.
If your loved one can't hear the person or is unable to answer, they automatically send help.  We test the unit monthly, and we are satisified that it works the way it should.  They always know who is calling, have the address and repeat it to us.  Everyone I've ever talked to at Bay Alarm has been courteous and helpful.

I wanted to add GPS to my present service. Esmeralda took me through the added program, step by step, including costs, and guided me through the signing process with out a hitch. As an added plus, Esmeralda was patient, thorough and answered every question clearly.  Did I mention she is also delightful to talk to? Well,  yes she is.

Since the first call I made to find a system for my mom, Bay Alarm has been fantastic.  I do my due diligence before making a decision and I'm always a little leary of 'bait and switch'.  Everyone I have spoken with at Bay, and the Dispatch center while setting up the system, is 100% fantastic.  I'm so very grateful for Bay Alarm and their Staff!</text>

The Bay Alarm Medical Alert unit gave my husband the security of knowing he could get help inside or outside the house.  It gave me a comfort level knowing the support desk would call me or 911 if needed, which allowed me to continue working.
After he was no longer able to leave the house and later became bedridden, it still gave him peace of mind and we continued to keep it after I retired and was there to care for him.  It was perfect for a man who refused to have a cell phone!<//text>

Bay Alarm has been great. I set it up for my Father who lived out of state. It was quick and easy. When my Father moved in with me the transfer was equally as easy. One call and they walk you through it all. Affordable and most importantly reliable. I would recommend without hesitation.<//review>

I recently moved, and needed to reconnect my
Bay Alarm Medical Personal Emergency Response System.
Today I was assisted by a very kind, patient and helpful
young woman named Amber. Amber walked me thru the process
with such patience, knowledge and encouragement, she made
it a pleasure .  I am not comfortable with technology as many 80 year
old widows may relate to.  She was a delight and in the end, I will
recommend your system to others because of the quality of your employees and my experience with this young woman.< /Review>

Carlos provided simple and clear answers to our questions. He was very efficient and helpful in getting the new service set-up -it could not have been easier. Carlos made sure we got the current special deals and was informative rather than doing a pushy sales pitch when describing accessory items or features. I appreciated that he spoke clearly and at a relaxed pace.</text>

I have been paying for this service for my 82 year old aunt for the past 5 months. Unfortunately, my aunt has fallen twice, and has had to call 911 on her own because she could not hear the voice of the Bay Alert representative.
Customer service people have been very friendly and willing to help, so hopefully we can get this issue resolved.< /Text>

Could not have asked for a better customer service experience.  Representatives are located in Concord, CA.  Knowledgeable and friendly.  Medical Alert system did not  work for us (through NO FAULT of Bay Alarm Medical) and return process was easy and resulted in ZERO out of pocket expense.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a Medical Alert System.  As an aside we've been Bay Alarm (home alarm) customers for years.  Was considering changing to another system, but after our experience with Bay Alarm Medical, we will stay with and seek out ANY Bay Alarm services!< /text>

I am the adult daughter of an amazing 98-year old.  Mother is independent, feisty, and refuses help at almost everything.  She still lives alone, drives, reads, knits sweaters, mows her lawn, cooks all her meals and does all her laundry.

However, after two tough falls (and 45-stitches) inside the house, and one bad fall outside, I told her that it was time to get a personal alarm.

We wanted a unit that she could use inside the house for physical falls or if someone tries to break in.  And I wanted a unit that she could use outside that would reach for several hundred feet from the base unit.

Bay Alarm Medical fit all our needs perfectly!  And she has been faithful in wearing the necklace at all times (it also came with a wrist band unit).

If she pushes the alarm, I love how there can be several calls made: first to me, then to 911, etc.  This is important so the fire department doesn't show up, if she inadvertently sets it off.

The clarity of the voices is great too, since she's hard of hearing.

So for me and my mother, the peace of mind, the clarity of reception, the responsiveness, and the price is worth its weight in gold!< /Review>

<Text>My mother lives 500 miles away so I got her the Bay Alarm Medical Alert.  Last night she mistakenly called for help, and when she did not answer her phone, the folks at Bay Alert tried to contact her niece, and then her nephew, who both live near her and were the first two on the call list.  After failing to reach either of them, they called the paramedics and then called me.  Everything was ok and it was a false alarm, but I feel much more comfortable knowing Bay Alert is watching out for my mother.</Text><resp>{'time': 1555950838272, 'text': "Hi Todd - We are so glad to hear it was just a false alarm and mom is okay! We understand how worrisome it is to live far away from our loved ones, but we are glad to help you and mom have some peace of mind. If there is anything more you or mom needs, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you so much for your kind words. All the best, Bay Alarm Medical"}</resp>< Rating>

I ordered a third medical alert system today from Bay Alarm Medical. I currently have systems for my aunts. The one I  ordered today was for my brother. I would not continue to entrust my family’s health and safety to this company if I weren’t completely confident in and satisfied with their service. The only problem I have with Bay Alarm is billing. I have received notices three times that monthly debits from credit cards could not be processed because no funds were available. When I called Bay Medical, the situation was addressed immediately, satisfactorily, and courteously.< /review>

I got this for my mom when my dad passed. It worked well and everything was great until the unit stopped working. Upon calling to have the unit replaced I was informed it would be $150 dollars. Are you kidding me, we're renting the hardware and if it fails I have to pay for a new unit. I'm paying for a service that Bay Medical provides using this equipment. I immediately cancelled and sent the unit back. They keep charging until the equipment is returned. And if you don't return it it will cost you $299 dollars. Everyone is nice on the front end...you never know the real ethics of a company until there is an issue. Hope this helps everyone out there.</text>

<Review>I called to update my credit card. Agent was difficult to hear and there was noise on the line. I am a young person with no hearing issues! When I told her she spoke louder then moved the mic closer and I could hear her clearly. Given the service you provide is primarily for elders having agents speak clearly and into their mic is critical. If my mother was calling this would be a frustrating experience.< /Review>< Response>

Bay Alarm Medical was a no hassle easy to use part of my mom's care plan. We got the service after my mom fell the first time and laid on her floor waiting for help. The next time she fell, she simply pressed her alert neck fob and the paramedics arrived in a matter of minutes. Low cost and reliable service, they always answered quickly.<//Text>

<review>I needed to call Customer Service during the ordering process & they were patient & helpful. The unit arrived quicker than I anticipated. The unit was easy to install; we have the landline version. We tested the 'button' in the house & out at the mailbox, all worked fine. My reason for the 4 stars is that the box only contained a 1 sheet installation instructions. I had to call a couple of times to ask some 1st timer questions which could have been alleviated with a User Guide. I selected this unit based on several review sites, including AARP.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Lost my husband’s Bay Alarm call button when he went to the ER over the weekend. They removed it to take X-rays then couldn’t find it when we were ready to leave.

Ordered the alarm system for my mother. It was tested and retested and worked great. She really likes the small button that she wears around her neck that does not get in her way. My mother lives 80 miles from me and she wants to live on her own as long as she can. This gave me great piece of mind and will help me keep my promise to my Father..

<review>The medical alert system that was sent to me was not what I requested. I requested the one that is connected to my cell phone only as I do not have a landline. I told the representative that at the time of the order. I am returning the equipment. I was very displeased with your company. Hopefully you can send me the right equipment. You were highly recommended,< /review>< Pics>

At this time, I can't comment on the monitoring service because we haven't received the package yet.  What I can say is their customer service is exceptional.  Sarah O. the representative that I worked with was very knowledgeable. She was very patient with all of my questions and made the process of getting this service in place very easy.  After a lot of research, I felt that their pricing was the best also.< /text>

Though I have not had to use this medical alarm, a friend of mine has and she recommended Bay Alarm to me.  She had other systems prior to Bay Alarm and was not satisfied.  When testing the system, an immediate response was received and the monthly fee of $19.95 is within my budget.</Text>

Each time we had called Bay Alarm Medical a good person answers and carefully qualifies who you are and reason for calling.  They are always willing and able to help without passing you on to someone else.  We have found Bay Alarm to highly supportive!

Called and spoke with them again today and they answer the phone, listen to your problem and provide a resolution.  What mare could you ask for?</Review>

Excellent purchase experience.  The Sales Person was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  She actually answered the questions I asked and didn't avoid providing direct answers like a lot of sales people do.  She demonstrated a sincere concern regarding the home situation I was attempting to address.  And best of all, everything she told me verbally was exactly the same as the terms of the written agreement that I was asked to sign.</review>

I have been a customer of Bay Alarm Medical for about 5 years.  After my husband died and I am living alone, I found it comforting to know I had help just a button away.  I actually used it a couple months ago when I fell in my kitchen and literally could not get up.  They called 911 for me and the EMTs checked me out and found everything was OK.  However, it took the two of them to get me back on my feet.  I am so thankful for that help.  I might have been there a very long time before anyone knew of my problem.< /Text>

<Time>1537305369055< /Time><review>My Mother, who was only accepting this monitoring system to placate her children, is very happy with it! In her words, " The people who come on the system (after a false alarm), are very kind and caring. They helped me learn how to turn off the alarm."
The only reason I did not give a 5 star rating, is because one of the monitors, a "button" for sleep, was not included in the initial package and I needed to call for it after realizing she did not have it.<//review></record>

<Time>1563315678970<//Time><review>Good response from tech service. He deserves a 5 star.  However, he could not help me thus the three star.  I need to connect to the caretaker app on my tablet that seems to be incompatible with the app. My tablet, Samsung TAB3Lite Galaxy SM-T110 cannot download the Bay alarm medical app.  I'm not pleased with that.  Samsung should address the problem.</review>< pics>

We are so glad to hear our tech support representative gave you 5-star quality help as he tried to work through the issue with the download. We are so sorry it is not working and definitely understand your frustration. Perhaps you can call Samsung tech support to see why the tablet is not allowing you to download. It doesn't seem like an app issue on our end, but rather a device issue, which is not something we have control over. We understand your 3-star rating due to the issue, but hope you can consider changing it as our tech support cannot fix Samsung's issues.\n\nThank you,\nBay Alarm Medical"}<//resp>

<Text>Person I spoke to was excellent.
However you need to provide a bill/receipt for usage to allay fears of not having service from my mom.
The reason I called is that I knew our 1st 6 months of use was up and I was expecting a bill or at least a receipt for the service payment for the next 6 months. Although this is automatic  a notice of payment, receipt etc should have been provided.
This would have prevented me from contacting bay alarm about it and provided me and my mom that I have this service for, confidence that her service was continuing. She has been nervous that it would not be and worried about the bill.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
{'time': 1532020215530, 'text': "Hi Eric - Thank you for your feedback. We apologize for the confusion and any worry this may have caused. As a reminder, if for any reason a payment did not process, we will make multiple attempts to contact the customer via phone and mail - we will not just turn services off. We understand life happens and credit card info can change, so we wouldn't just turn service off without reaching out to the customer without sufficient attempts. We would also like to apologize that you did not receive a receipt, because of your feedback we have made sure receipts were being sent properly. Customer feedback matters a lot to us and we want to ensure your experience in every way is positive. Please give us a call if you have further questions or concerns. Again, we thank you for your feedback and helping our team become even better! Best regards, Bay Alarm Medical"}</response>

I signed up with Bay Alarm Medical to protect my 83 year old mother from any accidents that might occur. She is widowed and lives alone in her house, possibly 30 to 40 minutes away from my apartment.  Her health is failing, and my two sisters and I worried about her constantly. I would frequently check the status of the Bay Alarm home system when I went to visit her. The customer service was always courteous, patient, and extremely efficient.
Three weeks ago my mother fell and was unable to stand up. My mother activate the alarm and Bay Alarm Medical quickly contacted an ambulance to be dispatched to her home. The technician then called me to let me know my mother had fallen. My mother later told me that she was amazed at how quickly the paramedics arrived at her door. She was taken to an emergency room to be treated. The professionalism and efficiency of Bay Alarm Medical's assistance was absolutely excellent. Their service provided was everything I had wanted it to be. I am very impressed with this company and I am extremely grateful for the protection they have provided for my mother. Cheers and thank you.

Bay Alarm is an excellent company, unfortunately I it was not the right fit for my elderly Mom. She is hard of hearing and the alarm was set off by her cat. The emergency services did respond quickly, so it does what it says. The customer service is A 1 in terms of being helpful. I would highly recommend them.</Review>

My mother lost her alert bracelet.  I called Bay Alarm Medical and they sent out a replacement for her at no charge.  I chose this service for mom approximately 4 years ago and have had no problems with it and great response when needed. Their call center is in the U.S. and operators are easy to understand.<//Review>

If you live alone and have an ongoing health issue, you should get this service.  They provide you with a pendant that you wear and you tell them where - outside - you have hidden a key to your house.;.  In a medical emergency, push the button on the pendant and it notifies this company, who in turn immediately calls an ambulance..  They tell the ambulance folks where key to your house is hidden so they can get in.   I once accidentally pushed the button on my pendant - without realizing it - and within minutes, an ambulance was at my door and two medics came running in, using the key I had hidden.  I apologized profusely - but at same time was impressed/relieved to see how well the service worked.  .Great company, great service.<//Text>

Bay Alarm is a top notch service.  Customer support is fantastic and when my 92 year old mother fell three different times, Bay Alarm notified us and contacted the E squad for transport very quickly each time.  I highly recommend Bay Alarm.<//Review>

<review>My widowed mother cherishes her independence, but many family members were becoming concerned that she should no longer live alone. I researched the various offerings, and selected Bay Alarm as our provider. I could not be more pleased. They had a package deal that was perfect for us ... protecting Mom while at home AND away from home. Every conversation with them has been great, the equipment is quality, and the whole family is pleased. Keep up the good work, Bay Alarm Medical!</review>< pics>

We were alerted by email that we needed to update our account info because it was time to make a payment.
I logged into their website and easily made the changes that were preventing the automatic billing cycle to complete, then called customer service and alerted them. They confirmed that the changes were ‘in’ and proceeded with the billing while we were talking on the phone. They also confirmed during that conversation that our billing was caught up and I received a confirmation email a few minutes later. Very effecient, very easy to do business with, always vigilant and on the job.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I was very upset  when I recently received a letter canceling the service of a disabled relative due to non-payment of charges. When I called, I discovered that when Bay Alarm switched to another accounting system, my credit card on file was not transferred and bills were being sent to an old address.  I admit I didn't catch it on my credit card statement.  The customer service representative who I spoke with was courteous and efficient.  Service was reinstated within an hour of my paying the balance due.  As a result I decided to stick with Bay Alarm Medical.</review>< pictures>

When we decided to look for a system for my mom, this was the second place we called. I was pleased with how friendly Eduardo was with getting me set up and I love that we have no contract. With logic, one would know that we get these devices because things are uncertain with our loved ones. To sign a 3 year contract would be ridiculous! Bay Alarm is month to month!  After receiving the device, I had a little trouble setting it up. I think I overthought the directions and didn't realize how easy it really was. We did a test call just to make sure everything worked and again the service was great. I'm glad I can finally sleep in peace knowing help for my mom is now a button away. I also know that if she ever has to use the device, we are comforted with the idea that the customer service is top notch!< /Review>< pics>

Our carrie!r was going to change us over to digital service.  The customer service was very helpful and gave me a tech's phone number if Grande had any problem with the installation.  He/she also told me to have him test the system before he left so he would not need a trip back to fix anything that was not right.  We tested and all was o.k.  He/she also reminded us to test our personal necklaces weekly to make sure they were working properly.  He/she also asked us about both people here and if the address was still the same.  Very helpful<//review>

Great customer service all the way around, and the product works just as it should.  Purchased the simple land-line version.  It's great they offer both the pendant and wrist device.  My Mom likes the wrist device as it stays out of the way when moving around.</text>

Staff was informed, capable, polite, helpful, as always. However, the alarm button is problematic. It went off when I placed it horizontally on a shelf, it told me "fall detected," and that I could cancel the alert by pressing the "HELP" button for two seconds. I did so, but 9-1-1 was called anyway. EMTs arrived, were told it was a mistake, were understanding.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Everything was great until they cancelled my dad’s service without any notification that I received.  Told that I received emails and letters which I have no records of ever receiving. My sister and I take impeccable care of my dad and keep records.  Oh, I did receive the email on the day it was cancelled. My dad was left without service from a company  I put my trust in.  Now trying to rectify this problem is ridiculous.  Sorry for the inconvenience is not enough or one month off of the bill.  Are you serious? This is how you treat your costumers who place their trust for their dad’s life in.  You put him in great harm but not sufficiently notifying us before you cancelled his service.  By the way, how about other ways to contact seniors, who many don’t have internet.  I respect that you are a green company, but how about a phone call to a 91 year man that you are cancelling his services!!  You should not be in a business making money off of seniors, if you can’t give them a courtesy phone call!<//text>< Pics>

This product works as advertised.  Any time our father pressed the button or fell the alert went out.  The only issue which isn't the products fault is that people advanced in years don't think to push the button.

The box it came in should have had some instructions for powering down for return.  We unhooked it and it started to alert us to the fact there was no power or phone.  There isn't an off switch.  A day later when I was able to call during business hours they said they could talk me through powering down but by then it was to late.< /Text>

The Bay in home monitoring system most likely saved my mom's life on three different occasions.  In two cases she had fallen (she is 92 and uses a walker) outside her home.  Bay Alarm dispatchers called 911 and paramedics arrived very quickly.  Contacts were notified quickly as well.  On the third occasion she had a home invasion and pushed her pendant button and the Invaders left when the Bay Alarm dispatchers came on the monitor speaker and ask what the emergency was.  My family is very thankful for Bay Alarm!  Great service at an excellent price!<//review>

Having had to obtain a new credit card to charge the service fee for my mother's Bay Alarm Medical account, I needed to update my billing information.  My phone call was greeted by a pleasant woman who quickly verified me as the paying person for my mother's account and proceeded to quickly and efficiently document my new credit card information in your files.  It was a very quick phone call handled very professionally, for which I am most appreciative.<//review>

The Customer Service and Tech Support personnel are absolutely outstanding!!  This is the #1 reason, which determined why I chose Bay Alarm Medical . They have been so kind and showed me so much patience to help me get my mobile gps system up and running. If you Google Bay Alarm Medical and find its reviews, you will find that the #1–ranked medical alert company, is Bay Alarm Medical 95% of the time. I spent several weeks doing research on medical alarm companies, whenever I had a few minutes. Today, Customer Support once more time helped me to get my 2 devices set up. It is a pleasure to work with Bay Alarm.<//text>

Have been a Bay Alarm Medical subscriber for 1.5 years and glad we have it because my wife fell in our kitchen last week and took advantage of her lanyard button to call for help. Bay Alarm quickly contacted our local emergency services who were fast and responsive; and also notified me that my wife called for help. Given my wife is home alone when I'm at work, I was thankful that our neighbor was able to open the front door for the fire department and paramedics. The alternative would have been a forced entry. I have since installed a combination lock box as another option for first responders to gain access in an emergency. Additionally, every representative I've contacted has always been professional, friendly and helpful with any service or billing questions. Have updated to 5-stars because Vanessa Castro helped reset our account to the lower monthly rate and appreciate the responsiveness to my initial review. Thank you!<//Text>

<review>Twice in the past several years I needed to get to the hospital. Once I pushed the button that I wear around my neck and the other time I called the Bay Alarm # and each time an ambulance came promptly and took me to the hospital.  I am appreciative of the system.</review><rating>5<//rating>< Pics>

Had an emergency contact phone number I had to change. I call and the call went flawlessly and quick. Information I gave was reread back to me to ensure that the right information was recorded. This is very important to me and for the health of my mom.< /review>

I had occasion to ask Bay Alarm Medical to summon an ambulance for me on the 9th of April, 2019.  I can't tell you how pleased I was to learn after the fact that both of the people I listed as contacts were notified of my call, told that I was okay and informed to which hospital I was transported within minutes of my call for help.

BAY ALARM,  THANK YOU......I AM IMPRESSED!< /text>

I just wanted to brag on the service provided by Bay Alarm Medical during the time my father-in-law has been ill. We moved him AND the alarm to our house with no problem and the competent advice and guidance of Mae at Customer Service.

Thanks for all you do.

AWESOME experience.  Didn't know much about these alert systems and Carlos and Ashley guided me through the process.  They helped me  learn what I needed to know, choose the right equipment and get the best deal. The service was friendly,  knowledgeable and I'll have my system set up in just a few days.

My Mom had to call when she fell and couldn't get up. Bay Alarm called 911 and then me, her daughter. In this case it probably would have been better to call my brother 1st and then dispatch 911. But everyone was very helpful and Mom got the help she needed. I just need to find out what protocol we have set up, to see what would be more efficient. Thanks so much for your help.<//Review>

It is abundantly clear that when Trisha and Carlos are not busy selling medical alarms, they are posting great reviews under new Google accounts to boost the star rating on this company. Please Senior Citizen's don't fall for this mess, you really won't find other companies with this many good reviews all being so specific about how their sales rep helped them out so perfectly.... Major Red Flag...< /Review>

The Bay Alarm Medical System is a wonderful investment! The service they offer allows me to move around freely without any worries of being alone. The lanyard they supply is also small and does not get in the way of my daily activities. The best part to consider, is that the button is waterproof! Taking it in the pool for my daily swim or the shower helps reassure me that help is only a push away. With my lanyard I am free to do anything I would like. The entire system was easy to install and the customer service agents at Bay Alarm Medical are always there to help. I would recommend Bay Alarm Medical to anyone looking for a life alert system with easy connection to your family incase of emergencies.</text>

<text>We have this service to use in an assisted living facility for my Mom. They use pull cords and with her limited ability to move around, even with a walker, her wrist alarm has been a life-saver-literally. If she falls , and can answer the alert ,  we have programmed the nurse's station number for Bay Alarm to call them to assist her. If she doesn't answer, 911 is notified and the nurse's station.  She has  fallen so many times -with the alarm we have peace of mind that help will be there quickly.
After my Mother's most recent fall, the staff stated they wished all residents  had the service.</text><Date>1522382018622<//Date><Resp>{'time': 1522781632656, 'text': "Hello Karen - Thank you for your review and sharing the experience your mom has had with our services in her assisted living facility. We are happy to know she has the safety of a medical alert system, whether it was ours or another company's - that 24/7 protection is important and we are glad you and your mother have that peace of mind. If she refers us to her friends and they sign up, be sure they mention her name so both her and her friends can take advantage of our Refer-A-Friend program.

<text>During a power outage, my alarm system gave me some problems.  It kept waking me trying to help me.  I disconnected the system but later found out there was a way to power down the system until power goes back on.  The agent that called the following day gave me instructions and emailed me a copy.  The copy also gave me directions on how to reactivate the system. That copy is now in my Bay Alarm file and I shall use it if we again have a power outage and the system acts up.  I am very satisfied with the help I received.<//text><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /GmapID><username>Arlene Moore<//username>< Pics>

I appreciated their service throughout my time of usage, but was disappointed when calling to cancel. The rep did not explain to me how to turn off the system. When boxing it, it kept speaking. I had to call a 2nd time, again a long wait on hold and the "leave a call back number" system disconnected me. Finally reached a rep, Corrina who was very helpful explaining how to terminate the connection which should have been given in the first call.<//review>

I was in a bad mood and she was the voice of reason that calmed me down. She knew exactly what was going on and diligently brought to light what was really my error, not Bay Alarms. I spoke with her twice in an afternoon, both times I was loaded for Bear. She was so patient and sweet that I couldn’t stay grumpy for long. She is a true professional and I hope she’s treated as such. The best interaction with customer service in a long time. I wish I could say the same about myself, but I can’t. That’s why Annetta deserves big kudos and she’s the reason I’m staying with Bay Alarm...at least one of them anyhow..Thank you Annetta!!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This is a review by your client Joyce Michaels...
As the daughter of Joyce Michaels, I feel that she made the correct choice in selecting  Bay Alarm Medical.  The instructions and tips that were given over the phone while setting up the system were invaluable.  I felt that you took the time to full explain my concerns professionally and compassionately. Thank you for your time.

I have had Bay Alarm service since 2012 and they literally have saved my life twice.   I am 91 years old and had two falls.  Each time, Bay Alarm was prompt and efficient in sending help.   They followed procedures and even called my son in law in Australia within minutes of my fall.  So comforting to know that Bay Alarm is there 24/7.  Thank YOU!<//text>

<Text>This is an updated review.  I am moving out of the area and I needed to know if I can continue to use Bay Alarm.  And, also, I am contemplating not having a land line when I move, so I needed to know all the ramifications, etc.  The lady who helped me was excellent.  She listened to all my questions and answered them very well.  Her explanations were detailed and by the time the call ended, I felt very comfortable that I knew what to expect when I move.  She very much deserves a solid 5 star rating.  Also, I want to commend Bay Alarm on the excellent service they have given me the past several months.  Everything worked as advertised.  I was able to communicate with them even when outside of my house, etc.  I usually test the system once a week and they are always very polite and concerned about how I'm doing and whether or not I'm OK.  I plan on continuing with Bay Alarm when I move, and I whole heartedly recommend Bay Alarm to anyone who is in need of their service.</Text>< username>

The dispatch and customer service are both great.  Was very disappointed however to learn that they recently switched their payment processor and no longer support PayPal as a payment method.  Also, customer service is strictly via telephone, no online support at all; so bummer there as well.  Nevertheless, their value is still quite excellent.</Text>

< Review>
My 87 year old mother-in-law lost her wrist monitor.  I called Bay Alarm and the person I talk with was so incredibly nice and helpful.  She is sending us a complimentary device which goes far and above what I had expected.  Customer service is a lost art, but someone has taught this company what's important.</Review>

The young lady with whom I spoke was very pleasant. She sent me a copy of the form in question, but I can't figure out how to complete it on my laptop. Please send me a version (like e sign documents) that I can complete and send back via e mail.
Thank you,

My question was answered properly by tech support.  Within a minute I opened my online account and could see all details.  I was hoping that I could do more with my online account such as managing the list of emergency phones that Bay Alarm monitor will call when my aging mom pressed the button for help so that me and all of my siblings know something just happen to my mom.  I clicked all links there but could not find a way to do it online.  Maybe another call to tech support is in order.</Review>

I have not had to use the button except for two times when it was hit by accident.  The machine was answered and I explained what happened and there was no problem.

I am mad as hell. My mother has been waiting a week for a new fall detection necklace. Her battery completely died last week. I called and requested a new necklace last Friday and asked that it be overnighted. I was told it would be overnighted on Friday. I knew better than to think it would get here by Saturday, but it should have been here by Tuesday at the very latest! On Tuesday I called Bay Alarm AGAIN and was told it was in the mail. I received a UPS email stating that I had a package set for delivery for today, Wednesday, but when I checked, it had JUST been entered into the system as a label was created. I am Mad. My mom has been a long time customer of Bay Alarm. She cannot stay at her house without this system so she is staying with me for now. She wants to go home to her own home, but can't because someone didn't do their job. Did I mention how mad I am?

I just ordered a new system from another company and should have it by Friday. Bay Alarm will be canceled first thing in the morning. If you value your safety I suggest that you think long and hard about continuing doing business with Bay Alarm. They are not even capable to get a new fall detection necklace in the mail...<//text>

<Review>My father has been in a nursing home for the past year and passed away today so this alert system was not used. Today we happened to receive a bill from Bay Alarm Medical via my fathers Discover card. We called the company and we were told that we have to return the equipment first. When we asked if the $239.40 charge would be reversed we were told to return the equipment then we will discuss it. While the company may reverse the charge, the customer service department certainly didn't commit to anything. Careful with these guys...<//Review>< Pictures>

Excellent monitoring service! Used Bay Alarm Medical for my 91 year old mother for  2 years. They responded promptly when the call button was pushed and  quickly sent emergency help on the occasion when my mom fell. I would highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical for anyone needing monitoring for a loved one.

I can't say enough good things about Bay Alarm Medical. I did a lot of research, and was skeptical / defensive going in to this. But each and every one I talked to--AND YES! I actually TALKED to people! --gave excellent customer service. Both in understanding the stress and interruptions from my father, and in delivering a super effective and affordable product. So far, so EXCELLENT!<//text>

Bay Alarm gave my mom great service at a fair price. Having a friendly helpful voice at the touch of a button allowed her to live on her own for many extra months. Thanks for your great service.</text>

Bay Alarm Medical did a great job monitoring my Mom while she was in the last year of her life. When she died and I needed to cancel our services, I was advised to return the equipment quickly and to make sure I get a receipt that this equipment was received- which I did. When I called to see if my service had been cancelled- I was told that it would take up to 3 weeks for the service to be cancelled and that my account was still active! I was also told that they had no information about my equipment being returned. It would be helpful for the people who answer the phone to have the information we need when we call. Losing a mother is stressful enough.< /text>

I was surprised to have my mobile necklace break after only a few months. It makes me question the quality of your product. I can't but worry if I selected the best company for my alarm</review>

<Text>we were on the phone with Bay because our unit was false signaling a help call.  We told you the situation was OK.

Fire Dept was dispatched for some reason, which is not cool.

setting up the account, passing on vital info, etc., also quite simple. chose Bay Alarm because they promised longer time for battery to hold power. we shall see whether that is true. only time will tell.< /Review>< Pics>

The system works very well and they have great coverage around the house both inside and out. Knocking off a star because I was on a three month billing cycle and was billed twice in the most recent cycle. I called and it was quickly removed and when I asked for an explanation, I was told that somehow it must have changed to a monthly plan. But if that was truly the case why would the charge be the same for three months of service? Just goes to show... KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS! Makes you wonder how many people get erroneous charges like this and just never notice it.<//review>< Pictures>

I was very impressed when I was contacted by the company that some thing was wrong with the base unit. If their monitor would not have let them know there was a problem. they would not have contacted me to get the problem corrected..... The person talked me through what to check and stayed with me until the problem was solved. Each time I have contacted the company from the start, they have treated me with respect and concern. Thank you<//review>

Excellent customer service.  While we have just ordered a system, we are hopeful that the high level of customer service continues.  Trisha did a great job of answering all of our questions and being patient while we made some comparisons.  While price was a factor in making a decision, it wasn't the only factor.  This company had the right price, solid monitoring capability and, above all, a great customer service rep in Trisha!< /Review>

<review>The customer service is very disorganized. I spent 30 minutes ordering a device for my mother in anther state and I had given my information for emergency and some other important numbers. I had to call them to ask why EMT was dispatched and I was not notified. Besides the fact that my mother had told them she was testing the device, and they sent out EMT anyways, they also did not have my mother's home line on file or my phone. They claimed that I needed to fill out a form but I had never received a form to fill out and the customer service person had taken my information and I assumed she would input it into the computer.

They are also very difficult to contact and to receive a call back.

I am giving them another chance but I am not at all convinced this is a company I can rely on.< /review>< Pictures>

It was almost impossible to attach because of some  small thread like pieces that you had to thread through the piece itself and then the way the lanyard adjusted left a large loop and the adjuster piece itself hanging off the back of your neck. The way that the piece hung from the lanyard made it very unattractive.  The bay alarm website there is not a picture of someone wearing the piece so that you can see the very strange lanyard. Also it did not come with a thorough instruction book. there was a small folded paper.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

After much research on the top ten medical alert companies, I have placed an order for Bay Alarm Medical service for a dear friend of mine.   I placed 3 calls for answers to questions I had and spoke to two different representatives.  I got all my questions answered in a clear, helpful way and the process for placing the order was not difficult.  The equipment will arrive this week and I don't anticipate problems with set up.  My friend is looking forward to the peace of mind this service will provide her and I am too.<//text>

<text>I purchased a bay alarm medical system last year for my uncle who is 93 years old and lives alone, He could not get out of his chair the other day and was unable to get to the telephone. He was able to press the pendant he was wearing which contacted Bay Alarm who in turn contacted the first responders as well as his personal contacts. He did need medical attention and  everything worked like clock work. Well worth the cost for the peace of mind and care that he needs.

Absolutely great customer service!  I provide this alert for my cousin who lives across country from me.  Bay Alarm had contacted her because her device was detected as not working. We found out there was an issue with her phone line. During this time, customer service not only called her and patiently answered her questions, they contacted another family member to explain the issue and checked to ensure my cousin was safe.  Outstanding support and follow through.< /Review>

<Review>Do not use this company.  I got a necklace with fall detection for my mother who has had falling issues.  Last month she had a stroke when she was alone in a room and could not move or talk. Fortunately, my father randomly walked in the room and found her and had to call 911.  She is incredibly lucky to be alive after a procedure to remove a blood clot.  When I called Bay Medical Alarm and we tested the fall activation over the phone with them, we discovered the device was faulty and did not work.  I explained the situation and asked to be reimbursed for the 3 months we had the device and was told by multiple employees that they would only reimburse me the $10 per month for fall detection, but not the total amount per month.  After I pushed to speak with a supervisor, I was told I would get a call back from a customer service supervisor (after several calls) within 24 hours and instead it was another front line staff who called back and told me the same thing.

When I went in person and we tested the new necklace they would replace it with, the alarm de-activated after the necklace was slightly moved.  I asked if this is typical and they told me that if the person falls and the alarm is set off, it will de-activate if they move at all (this makes it completely ineffective).  I explained that I was never told this when I ordered it.  The billing supervisor (Rebecca) told me that this had all be explained to my sister when she picked it up and that they had offered to test the necklace before she took it home, but she declined.  I called my sister and she said both of these things were lies.  When I shared my mother's story with Rebecca in person, she said that they would not give me the full refund because since only the fall detection was faulty, my mom "could have pushed the button".  I can't believe anyone would be insensitive enough to say such a thing after I just explained that my mother almost died and couldn't talk or move after she fell!!! Finally, after several more phone calls, I reached the customer service supervisor who agreed to fully refund us for the 3 months.  Unbelievably upsetting experience!< /Review>< Pics>

Bay Alarm Medical has been more than I could've ever hoped for! I purchased this system for my grandparents and I must say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.they came highly rated, and for good reason. Everyone I've spoken with has been knowledgeable, transparent and attentive to my every need. I sleep easy now knowing my grandparents are never alone, someone is there to help them at just the push of a button. Five star service, without a doubt !< /Review>

I am writing this post only as a review of the customer service I received from my online chat with Vicki and with Carlos, my customer care representative.  Both were courteous and helpful to me.  Carlos filled me in with all the particulars about the system I would be receiving and how the calls would be answered.  He was honest on the distance the system would work and all the costs involved.  I will give the system 6 months and then review it again.  So far I am pleased with the customer service.<//text>

Great customer service.  We are so appreciative of the wonderful monitor operators that work for you.  Even with more than a few false alarms, each call was handled professionally and kindly.  The last few calls were lifesavers.  Thank you so much for the wonderful service you provided to my father-in-law.  We all rested much easier knowing you all were a button push away.< /Review>

Very good service, pleasant, knowledgeable, and equipment works well. I would recommend them, if they are needed.  They are not as expensive as the guys on TV.</text>

Needed a new lock box due to being unable to get the one I had open. Used a screw driver and hammer on it and it opened. A new one is being sent and a helpful tip on opening the lock was discussed. That should help.</review>

Carlos was exactly who I needed this morning.  He knew all the answers to my questions, when he was not sure he was able to research, without my waiting, and give me the answer.  His articulation, pacing and communication was excellent.  I think he is an incredible ambassador for Bay Alarm!  Take good care of him, he made the deal today!!!!<//Review>

I have only installed yesterday the test went well and I spoke to a responder while testing. Prompt and courteous. I spoke to CS today for some quick questions and she was just as prompt and courteous. I have one issue the wrist alarm is not working. However I will contact them when I return home and they will walk me through activating.< /text>

Excellent service.  Arranged this for my mother who ended up with 'drop foot' following back surgery and thus had to use a walker from then on. Her biggest fear was falling, naturally. I live in another state, so did some research and chose Bay Alarm Medical service for her safety and my peace of mind.  My mother had a couple falls where the service definitely got her aid ASAP and would stay in contact with her via the two-way In-Home device until help arrived.  BAM would call down the phone-tree of contacts we provided, leave a message if there was no answer, and continue calling down the list until they reached someone. She had a few false alarms from accidentally pressing the pendant button from leaning forward at her computer desk. In those instances she would be totally embarrassed, but the BAM staff were considerate, polite, and never shamed her for it. My mother is moving into an assisted living facility so we are cancelling the service now, but we never had a single complaint in the 3+ years she had the service. Highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.</Text>

Was trying to cancel service and find out how much I owed on my mother’s account. Took almost 2 months to accomplish this. Talked to 3 different customer service representatives, each saying that they would send information, call me back, but this didn’t happen. Finally yesterday, the representative gave me the information over the phone as the amount owed . I had to pay 30.00 for them to process check. I don’t think this is correct. Didn’t have problem with service but trying to get service stopped was the pits.</Review>

Bay Alarm medical alert device has been very helpful for my mom.  So far, she has not had any emergencies, but she did set it off accidentally twice and they called right away to see if she needed help.  Just a few days ago, there was a power outage and the unit operates on battery power.  The outage lasted a few hours, and we got a call to,see if we needed any help, which we did not, but it was nice to know that they knew what was going on and help,was quickly available if needed.  It's worth it for the peace of mind.<//text>

Needed a new pouch for the mobile unit because the one that came with the unit tore away from the belt hook the first time I used it. The pouch appeared to me to be poorly made. The sewing was not strong enough to stand up to the stress from the belt hook. The belt hook was difficult to hook to my belt because it is so strong. So the sewing attaching the hook to the pouch gave way on both sides rendering the pouch unusable to carry my mobile unit any way but in my pocket.

When the new one arrives I’ll watch to see if it happens again.  My call was promptly and professionally handled by customer service.  Thanks.<//Text>

Bay Alarm Medical has taken such a weight off of my shoulders.  We have not had the opportunity for them to have to deal with an emergency, thank goodness; however, my mother has had several "false alarms".  The operators could not have been more kind and reassuring to her.  She says that it gives her such peace of mind knowing that they are out there keeping an eye on her.  I am so grateful for Bay Alarm Medical.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>We’ve only had service for a couple months (for my mother), and couldn’t be happier! Staff is very professional and patient. Price is a better value compared to other companies that I researched - I paid for 6 months and received a free lock box that contains a key to her door for First Responders.  My mom has accidentally activated her alarm a few times, and they are VERY QUICK to respond. On one of the accidental activations, my mom had removed her hearing aid for bed and could not hear the agent. They followed protocol to a “T” and called 9-1-1 and then called me. I am very comfortable leaving my mom alone, knowing that Bay Alarm has their ears on for her 24/7!!!!<//text>< Pics>

This is Darlene Curry Thelma Reeders' daughter. When we needed this system, it was sssooo easy to install and thew people we dealt with were so nice and understanding. We were extremely fortunate that we never had to use it, but knowing that when she was home, she had it to call when she might need it. Thank you so much for everything.< /Text>

My aunt had two falls within 10 days of each other. She was not hurt either time but could not manage to get herself off the floor. She pushed her alert button and received immediate help from local response team. She is now so glad that she has the medical alert.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><date>1504898262862</date><Text>We got Bay Alarm's Fall Detection Pendant and several "help" buttons for my 90yr old Mother who lives happily in her own home.  It was very easy to set up. You don't have to know anything about tech devices or systems.  It's plug in, call them to test it and done!   She did use a call button to summon help a month ago when she felt ill.  Bay Alarm did a great job getting help to her and letting me know what was happening.  She's caused a few "false alarms" too and they are so kind about that too!  Not a problem.

I live a lot easier knowing Bay Alarm is in the house with my Mom when I can't be.

Because I had signed up for the fall detection, the neck device was extremely sensitive and after 3 false alarm calls I called the office for help.
We canceled the fall detection and they sent me a different neck device which is working out very well.  No more false alarms.< /text>

My 106yr. old Mother fell at her home this past week and I cannot rave enough about how fortunate she was to have a Bay Alarm Fall Detection button around her neck.  They responded quickly and she is back home now with a few black eyes. Very satisfied with Bay Alarm.  Thank you.< /Review>

Bay Alarm medical has policies which promote unfair treatment of senior citizens, due to unfair requirements for return of medical equipment which she was unable to use and inflexibility with returns.My mother purchased the Bay alarm medical alert device and upon getting it set up, realized that it does not work for her. She found the bracelets to be cumbersome and difficult to take on and off, which she was required to do regularly after taking a shower. She did not want to wear the necklace because it was uncomfortable her for as well. As soon as she realized this, she had me call Bay medical alarm to explain that she was going to be returning and make sure that she would receive her money back.*(I am serving as her representative because the logistics of calling and making complaints would be too hard on her right now). I was explained by numerous representatives and managers that there was no way that she could receive her money back and that the policy of 14 days starts upon current receiving the package, which at that point was over. I explained to the managers that because my mother is elderly, it took her a while to remember to open the package and get it set up and also that from the day that it was actually activated, we were within the 14 day period of that day. They would not budge at all. I explained that the product was not working out for her and asked for some leniency, based on the fact that she is a senior citizen and that we were only a couple of days after the grace period for return and well within the 14 days of activation. The managers were supposed to call my mother to fix the issue, but they never did. I had to call repeatedly to follow up and whenever I was told that they would not make an exception for my mother, they refused to give me the name of someone else to call who was higher up on the managerial chain. I feel that this is very unfair to not work with my mother on this issue and feel this is taking advantage of senior citizens. I worked with both the BBB and our local consumer affairs and no one was able to get through to them that they are committing elder abuse so hopefully they will read this review, modify their policies to be more accommodating to seniors and prevent this from happening in the future.< /Text>

My review concerns Kelly Spicer. What a fantastic person she is. Very friendly, honest, helpful, and she answers every question you could possibly help and if she isn't sure she will get the info and get back with the customer promptly. I look forward in speaking with he for future opportunities. She is a keeper. Great job Bay Medical Alarm for hiring her.<//review>

Good service with excellent equipment.  Alarm system is monitored in the US so response is quick and reliable.  Like them a lot and the registration process really made me summarize medical and other information and place hard copies where they can be found by EMS if necessary.

Positive experience.  Bay Alarm contact person patiently answered questions and provided thorough explanation.  No pressure to purchase and gave direct phone number to call for subsequent questions.
We will receive the system in a week or so and look forward to testing it.
We are glad to have the alarm service should it be needed.< /Text>

<Review>Rachelle helped me (Traci). After calling numerous other companies I was frustrated as this was a gift for my grandma. She made it easy and didn't push any unnecessary crap. Also this company was #1 on the list for medical alert companies. Thanks Rachelle!! Your awesome! Hope the company appreciates you!!

The company has very competitive rates and the equipment seems good. My only complaint is if you need help on the weekend in regards to at n issue with the equipment, you have to wait til Monday. Also instructions for the lockbox do not match what you really need to do. The company needs to address that.

7/4/18 Addendum After the company’s response to my initial review, I sent an email explaining who I was and I provided more details about my experience. I will say in the company’s defense my issue was resolved the following day after I called and left a voice mail, but the issue still remains that when I called Bay Alarm on a Sunday afternoon 2 hours before Customer Service closed, no one called me back that day. The company never contacted me after I sent the email.</text>

I have had a medical alert system through Bay Alarm for a year.  I have been happy with them, especially with their customer service.  I switched my health insurance companiy in November 2018.  My new company provides a different alert system; that’s the reason why I have cancelled my plan with Bay Alarm.<//review>

<review>My mother is 91.  She cannot see or hear well.  She is very independent and objected to a "babysitter", but I felt extremely uneasy leaving her home alone since I could not call her to check up.  This is my next step.  So far it seems to be giving both of us a measure of security knowing that she  can get help if needed.  She has only had it for a couple of weeks.  So far no problems.< /review><GmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef</GmapID><resp>{'time': 1543536365057, 'text': "Hi Elaine - Thank you for your review!

Bay Alarm alerted Mom that there might be a problem with the unit after a power outage at her residence. We tested and found that there was a problem that was quickly resolved by a technician over the phone. The tech also shared some good info on preventing a recurrence of the problem.
Mom hasn't needed the system but so grateful to have it in working order if she does!<//Text>

I tried another medical alarm unit that was recommended by a friend.  It was also a "5 star" system according to reviews. Well, after the set-up, I couldn't get a signal and had to return it. So after searching the different types, I chose Bay Alarm.  Guatalupe, my customer service rep,  helped me set it up.  Her expertise and patience with me in the process was awesome!  My system is up and running perfectly because of her help.  My husband travels with his job and we are both so pleased knowing Bay Mobile is right there ready to respond if necessary.

I just received my system today. I called Customer Service and it was the most professional and cooperative company I have ever contacted, Due to a mistake I made, I needed to call again and the response was just as good as the first call. The installation was simple and straight forward. I am so glad we chose Bay Alarm.

<Review>On behalf of my Mom, Natalie, thank you to Bay Alarm for always being so timely when testing the system. Fortunately we have not have any real emergencies but Bay Alarm's quick response during testing, and the professionalism of the staff, certainly give me peace of mind that should there be an actual emergency, my Mom is in good hands.
Thank you so much,

<text>Very disappointed in initial interaction with them.  Order was placed on a Tuesday, and according to their website the alarm was to be shipped that day via expedited service for which I paid..  However, it was not shipped until AFTER I placed a follow-up call to them on Thursday (two days later) asking for status.  The representative I talked to claimed it took a couple of days to process an order before shipping.  While I explained to the representative that their website said it would be shipped the day of the order (if placed by 2:00) he was not helpful in that regard and said he could not do anything.  Due to the fact the alarm had not been sent out at the time  I was speaking with them on the phone, and because the expedited service was no longer needed since I would not get it in time to take it to my relative the following weekend, I told him to cancel the expedited service and to send it regular delivery.  Again, remember this is before product had even been processed to be shipped out that day, which was already two days later than promised.  Notwithstanding that, the representative refused to adjust the shipping time and/or refund me the additional expedited shipping cost I had paid.  While the alarm was ultimately received, it was not received any quicker than if I had used their regular delivery service which was $25.00 less.  The company at a minimum should have refunded me the expedited shipping charge but instead of addressing my concerns, they refused to do anything.  I sincerely hope this is not how they respond to life threatening situations when an alarm goes off.  VERY DISSATISFIED with initial interaction with Bay Alarm.< /text></record>

<user>109628600108569604972<//user><text>We used this service for several years for our mother. For one month the system was somehow disconnected and we were not alerted to this. We received varying accounts of what occurred from different representatives. Fortunately she did not have a fall during that period.

Fast forward to when we needed to cancel the service when she went into a facility. The equipment was returned in December of 2017. I followed up to make sure they had received it, which they did. Here it is April, and I have made numerous calls to the company to receive a prorated check. I've received stories
that it was on its way, that they've had computer problems and so on. When I spoke with Alex, one of the supervisors on February 23rd and was told it would take another month. I called again on April 16th and was told that Alex would call me back. CRICKETS. The ineptitude of this company amazes me. I would not recommend them to anyone. The only option they leave you with is to provide them with negative public feedback.

UPDATE: I promptly heard from a supervisor with Bay Alarm and they apologized profusely and offered to refund the last month's service. I received the check the following day and consider this matter resolved and am satisfied with the result.

ANOTHER UPDATE: YET ONCE AGAIN I have received an invoice after canceling this service last year. Astounding!!!<//text><response>{'time': 1525713734306, 'text': 'Hi Lisa - We thank you for bringing this to our attention.

<Text>I am considering this system right now, but I have to say that as I'm reading these reviews, it is VERY obvious and extremely annoying that these reviewers have been prompted WAY TOO MUCH to mention how wonderful their Sales reps were when they signed up!! How does this warrant giving this company all of these 5 star reviews!?   It doesn't!!!       To keep hearing how wonderful "Carlos" or "Trisha" or "Rachelle" were on the phone during the service set up is not ANY indication of how well the medical alert system is going to be!  All of these 5 star reviews only look phony to the rest of us who keep having to weed through all of them to get to the real reviews of the actual service!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Maximum stars. I sent in an inquiry via the form on the web site, which is clear and professional, based on reviews of Bay Alarm Medical. I received same day email and phone call.  The email and documents explained virtually everything.  I called today and worked with Carlos and placed an order.  It was one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had.  I concur with the online reviews that Bay Alarm Medical is outstanding.</Review>

I had to push my button several times, 15 minutes later someone finally answered.  When I didn't answer my landline, which is in a different room, they dispatched help.  From the first push to the button till help arrived, it was an hour later.  I did call and asked Bay Alert to call my cell phone, not the landline, for a response.<//text>

Bay Medical was great in a crisis for my mother.  She was having trouble breathing and she pushed the panic button.  Bay Medical called for an ambulance, called her kids to alert us.  Also, they informed EMS which door they could get in without having to break down a door.  Thanks for such good service!</text>

<user_name>J D Gore III</user_name><review>I secured Bay Alarm Medical for my mom who lived by herself with few family around capable of tending to her like she needed. She was prone to falling and on several occasions she nearly died because no one knew she had fallen for days. Enter Bay Alarm and my sister and I had peace of mind because of the fall protection. My mom’s condition worsened to the point she could no longer care for herself and has moved to the assisted living facility of her choosing. The convenience of quarterly billing and automatic payment made the expense almost invisible. If I were in a position to need this type of service, Bay Alarm is my choice.

Very polite and receptive.
Initial alarm necklace/lanyard was defective and mom needed a new one. It was shipped promptly.
The most impressive thing was the patience of their operators with mom. As I presume that a great deal of their clients are geriatric, such patience (or forebearance) is uncommon, as many of their children can attest!</Text>

Bay Alarm Medical has been very professional and immediately responsive to our parents each and every time they have pushed their call buttons.   We are very pleased with their service and would recommend them to anyone need this type of service.   They have taken care of us very well and we wound not be discontinuing to use them but have moved our parents into an assisted living facility that supplies their own personal emergency buttons for them to wear.

This site was a real pain to work with. They couldn’t manage an address change after one year they still do not have it right. They always called the wrong people. The business side of this company is a nightmare. Th y did respond promptly when we tested the system- l will give them that. We left them because we every time there was a change they just couldn’t get it straight. We are moving to a competitor.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I just finished visiting with Trisha by phone. Based on our research and  information from Trisha, we have selected your protection plan. Trisha was excellent! She was informative, sensitive to our specific needs and she was very clear as she helped us understand all of the options.  In addition, she was pleasant as well as thorough. We very much enjoyed the whole process. Trisha is indeed a true asset to your organization. If your products and services are as good as Trisha's qualities then you have loyal fans. I am now 76 years old and a stroke survivor after five months in the hospital. With ongoing physical therapy I am doing quite well with a cane and we still travel here and there. Kathleen is healthy and drives our car; she is 74.She will travel some with our daughter and I will stay easily at home with the comfort my Bay Alarm device. I also have friends and neighbors. By the way, I have not fallen and hope I will not in the future. Thanks again for Trisha and Bay Alarm systems.

ATTENTION TO WHOMEVER IS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING BAY ALARM. PLEASE CHOSE LIFE ALERT OR ANOTHER COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT YOUR PARENTS OR FAMILY MEMBERS. PLEASE!! I WORKED HERE AND WITNESSED HOW THINGS OPERATE AND THEY DO NOT CARE FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR FAMILY. I’VE HAD TO DEAL WITH MANY PEOPLES PARENTS DYING BECAUSE THE BAY ALARM SYSTEM AND CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS FAILED THEM. IT WAS SAD AND HEARTBREAKING TO LISTEN TO THEIR STORIES AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HELP OR REFUND THEM. PLEASE LISTEN WHEN I SAY THAT THE WEBSITE IS FALSE INFORMATION. MARKETING MAKES IT SOUND NICE BUT WHEN YOU RECEIVE YOUR EQUIPMENT IT WILL BE YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THE FALL DETECTION BUTTONS THEY DO NOT WORK !! SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ON THE FLOOR FOR HOURS WAITING FOR THE HELP THEY WERE PROMISED. ITS A SCAM THEY DO NOT CARE. ITS A FAMILY OWNED BUSINESS AND THE FAMILY ONLY CARES ABOUT BEING RICH!!! IF YOUR IN NEED OF SOMETHING RELIABLE FOR MOM OR DAD OR ANY OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS PLEASE GO WITH ANOTHER COMPANY. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME. IVE WORKED THERE YOU WILL REGRET IT</Review>

The product I selected seems very well suited to our needs. My initial attempt to contact Bay Alarm via web & e-mail seemed very disoriented, but once we made phone contact arrangements went very smoothly. I am only at the "have ordered" state; no experience yet with the actual product/service.< /Review>

<Review>This is our second purchase.   The affordable peace of mind that Bay Alarm gave my mother in law and our family made it an obvious purchase choice for my mother.
Thanks Vincent and Jessica  (Jessica assisted me on my first purchase) for your professionalism and patience.  You made the process comfortable.< /Review><userid>111515110742384443871</userid><response>None<//response><Rating>5< /Rating>< pics>

<text>Called three days ago to get box replaced for my dads safety. They told me it will arrive over night for Tuesday. Call Tuesday it wasn’t even shipped and that it would arrive Wednesday. Checked today now they are saying that it wasn’t sent over night that’s it will be Thursday. This company is not trustworthy. My dad has had no way to call for help other than dialing 911 for 4 days. Very disappointed with customer service. Will look for other companies to go with.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I have been very pleased thus far. Both the sales rep and a customer service rep I called were knowledgeable and prompt. Both were in the USA and native English speakers, which is important for the older folks who need to speak with them on the phone.

The system is easy to install and use.

UPDATE: we are over a year in and I just had to make a few calls to tech support. They were very helpful and fixed the problem. They actually had diagnostics going back 9 months, which helped them solve my very vague problem (loss of dial tone in regular phone line). Hint: just hit the reset button.<//Text>

<Review>My mother was actually your client and we appreciated all of the help and security you offered her. She only closed her account when she moved to a living facility for seniors that had their own "alert" system.

Thank you for helping my mom Rouye Rush for several years.

I called today to get information on a mobile medical alert device. The service provided by their representative was superb - no high pressure to buy anything, just a sincere effort to help. It was a no brainer when it came time to decide whether or not to place the order. I'm giving them a try!<//Review>

<Review>I now have "peace of mind" when I leave my Mom at her apartment and i have noticed a sense of security within her since it has been in place. Even if I  forget to perform the monthly "check" with the monitor they will check on her. It scares the heck out of her but I can tell it is reassuring to her. Bay is highly recommended by me to others who may desire this type of  service.</Review><Time>1468695564824</Time><user_name>Tom Everette</user_name><Response>None</Response><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

All customer service people seem helpful. However disappointed that they are unable to control volume which makes quality of sound muffled a bit. Hopefully it will get better. We just set up the system.<//Review>

By accidentally hitting the button on my alarm, I learned how fast help was at my door.  2-3 minutes!

Both my daughter and I had a good test that Bay Alarm works.  My daughter said, "Well!  At least we know it works!"

Another plus, the crew who arrived were so kind, so helpful, so handsome.

thanks all around</Text>

<text>I changed my phone service to Vonage and could not get my alert system to work so I thought I was going to need an upgrade.  However while speaking with the customer service representative she said I didn't have it hooked up correctly. She walked me through the process and got me up and running. She  spent somewhere between 20 and 30 minutes on the phone with me. I really appreciated the time  and help she gave me. I have been with Bay medical for about two years and a couple of weeks ago I inadvertently set the alarm off.   Well a little while later the ambulance service was at my door and my son and daughter were frantically calling me so the moral of that story is the system really does work. Having  this alert system gives me great comfort.   I would definitely advise anyone living alone to seriously consider a medical alert system.<//text>< Pictures>

Your Telephone contact provided the information that I needed.
She was competent, patient and professional.

I signed up for your service in that one phone call.
And the e-mail documentation followed immediately.

Bay alarm medical helped my father when he fell more than once. They are very professional and responded immediately.
They also are very compassionate to the family members.
I would recommend them they are the best.

What kind of outfit waits 12 days past the payment due date to inform a customer of a date issue? This is literally a matter of life and death for my mom.

Well the price is right. But until I called they never shipped my medical alert for my 92 year old mother. I placed the order on 03/16/2019 so I called today 03/25/2019 they are just now shipping the device out, so basically if I had not called I would still not have received the medical alert. I also paid for 6 months of activation. Not happy will probably return the unit and go with another company.

Their cancellation and return policy needs work. The service was fine, even though we never utilized it. However, they fail to tell you once you cancel you must have the equipment back to them before the bill date. They still charge you for the service while they process your return which can take up to two weeks. Meanwhile they refuse to issue a refund while it's being processed. Also, I was paying quartley and they refused to change to it to monthly so that I was only charged for one month of service instead of three while they process my return. Take this into consideration before cancelling and returning their product.< /Review>

Customer service has been excellent so far.  I called on several occasions asking many questions.  Their reps were all patient and helpful, no pressure to buy. I am thrilled there was no contract to sign so we can "check it out".    I have placed the order today and we are awaiting arrival.<//Review>

I bought Bay Alarm for my elderly aunt and I am so glad that I did.  She did have to use the service once when she fell and the response was awesome. The ambulance nearly beat me to her house and I live next door. I would recommend Bay Alarm to anyone who needs this type of service.</Review>

<text>My mother lost her GPS unit from a side pocket of her purse during a shopping day in her home town.  After an initial panic moment and a fruitless search of her car, she called the contact number for Bay Alarm. They promptly and courteously calmed her and tracked her unit to a local store.  She returned there immediately, and the unit had been turned in to the front counter to be returned to her waiting hands!  What a relief to have such prompt and accurate customer service.  Thank you!</text><user>101331804605476376645<//user>< Name>

I pay for my sister, Paula, who has dementia to have the life saving alarm and very recently I got a call saying the ambulance was on its way to her home and her neighbor also got the same announcement. When I called to check on her, she said she didn't have anything wrong going on but by then the ambulance was at the door. We still don't know if her chihuahua accidentally pushed her alarm or what happened but it was so encouraging to see how quickly Bay Alarm Medical responded. If this had been an actual problem their quick response could have saved her life. Thank you Bay Alarm Medical!</Text>

<review>I have been very happy with Bay Alarm Medical alert system. My reasons for canceling had nothing to do with any problem with Bay Alarm. It was simply that I do not seem to be the ideal customer in that I'm always on the go and constantly forget to put on my alarm button or to take it off when coming and going.

SO, I've decided to get an Apple Watch instead to use for calling 911 or a family member if I should have any kind of an emergency.

Thank you for making the cancellation process so easy!

We got this device for my mother in law and it truly gives us peace of mind. It also makes her feel safer and allows her to remain independent for a while longer because if anything happens or she needs us , she just hits the button and they call us and tell us she needs us. This is truly a life saver by every sense of the term.<//Text>

When I first spoke to Rochelle, she was kind, very educated in the device and Bays qualities policies. My daughter research many alert companies and, indeed Bay won but more so Rochelle. When I called she was patient, caring and waked me through everything. I kept Getty it wrong but Rochelle calmed me done. I had just taken a bad fall. She was so concerned she stayed on the phone with me until she felt I was safe. She gave met phone number if I needed her. I am so grateful to Rochelle. She is an exemplary part of your team.

It's get to be able to customize what service and accessories you need. Super easy installation and very helpful tech support if there is a problem. I appreciate the fact you can test it to make sure it is working and this is encouraged to do once a month!  The response process when the ER button is pushed takes you thru informed steps so you know a person is coming online soon to help you very loudly too!</review>

Person I spoke to was very nice, but the lack of importance of April 13, 2019 incident was troubling. My alert call & my wife's just showed the call coming from Utah, 3rd alert call to my daughter showed Idaho. Thankfully my neighbor (#4) answered. Due to the high number of Robo & telemarketing calls we stopped answering them, unless ID. My call was to obtain your emergency call numbers to put in our contacts to ID your call.. Thankfully this was not an emergency. Please make this a high priority to your customers. Thanks Charles Bennett, son of Irene Finucan< /Text>

We understand our calls were not answered because it was coming from an unfamiliar number, but please know we made it a priority to alert family as quickly as possible. We do see that a representative provided you with the monitoring center phone numbers, which you can now save in your phone. Thank you for your feedback, we will be sure to further discuss with the team and take steps to improve customer experience. All the best, Bay Alarm Medical'}</response>

We have purchased this system for our mother who will be 90 at Christmas.  We are a little more comfortable knowing she has the system and understands how to use it.  That is essential that an elderly person knows how to use, be willing to use and not be intimidated by the technology.

Easy to use, easy to install, easy to test; we are all happy with the service.  Phil W</review>

Works like a charm so far.  I ordered the unit for my mother who is 86 and lives alone.  At first I couldn't get it to make the test call but we called customer service who advised me to try a different phone jack and stayed on the phone with me while we moved to another room, hooked it all up and made the test call.  Everyone involved was polite, friendly and efficient.  I think this is going to work out well!<//Text>

I arranged the Bay Alarm for my mom and over the past several years she has used it numerous times.  The service has been fantastic!  When an unfortunate event happens the agents make sure they reach us and they provide us a lot of detailed information to make sure we know what's happening, and where (which hospital) they may be transporting our mother.<//review>

The Bay Alarm System saved my dad's life.  He had fallen and hit his head and was able to be rescued because he was wearing his pendant.  He also had chest pains at one time from angina and Bay Alarm sent  rescue personnel.
The system is very reasonably priced and portable.  I highly recommend it for peace of mind.  The only difficult part was convincing my dad to always wear his pendant.  Stubborn old guy!</Text>

We thank Bay Alarm Medical for their many years of service. Mother used it and it was instrumental several times during emergencies.  I would highly recommend Bay Alarm Medical.  Quick responses and they stayed with us until the situation with mother was taken care of.  We can't thank them enough for their help.  Mother passed away last week or we would still be using it. No contract, just so much help and all questions answered as we spoke.  No waiting.  Thank you again for your services Bay Alarm!< /text>

It was not made clear by Bay Alarm that they would be calling in the event of an emergency from a phone number different than their regular number toll-free number.  So, at 2am my phone rang from an unknown number in Utah.  Thinking it was telemarking, I didn’t answer.  Turns out my grandmother who has the alert service was having chest pains and the paramedics were called.  They also called one other person on her emergency contact list, but did not leave a voicemail, and skipped calling the 2 other people on her emergency list.  Anyway, later that morning I got the voicemail they left and called back to ask where the paramedics took my grandmother, and they said the local authorities would not release that information due to the HIPAA act.  Really?!? Thankfully we have one main hospital near us, and they confirmed she was admitted.  I don’t know if this is a serious flaw in the HIPAA laws, or with this company, but it IS obvious to me that the person at Bay who took the 2am call was completely inept, and we suspect asleep when the call went through, since my grandmother said they acted and sounded like that, and even put her on hold at one point, so she was listening to on-hold music while having chest pains...  very reassuring Bay Medical!< /Review>

{'time': 1560191548377, 'text': "Hi Shawn - First and foremost, we hope grandma is doing okay and feeling much better. We understand your concerns and are currently looking into the account as well as listening in to all the calls. Our dispatch centers are located in Utah & Idaho, and do have different phone numbers as it is not in the same building as our headquarters here in California. We apologize for the confusion that may have caused you. Our dispatchers follow the standard protocol set up and always try to leave a voicemail, if the voicemail box is not full and if it is set up. In the event that they do not, they are trying to  quickly get to anyone on the list that will answer their phone. We do see a note on the account that she was placed on hold and notified that they are getting her help. It's best we place them on hold while getting help rather than hanging up. Again, we currently have someone from our Customer Care Team looking into your case so we can better assist the family and ensure that our dispatchers are upholding the standards we have set. We will be in touch with you shortly. Thank you for bringing this to our attention."}<//Response>

I selected Bay Alarm Medical as my alert safety system..I received it and immediately had a relocation issue.  I signed the cancellation form and sent the equipment back the same day 4/16/2018.  I am waiting for the confirmation of the cancellation.   I WAS CONCERNED AND CALLED THE CONCORD OFFICE and received  an explanation and the matter was cleared up as I am waiting for the warehouse to issue the notification.I was treated with kindly concern just now over the issue on the phone and want to commend the the company for hiring gracious and helpful agents.< /review>

i called in to report that I had not received a neck attachment for my
mobile device.  Two of your employees told me that it would be shipped overnight.  This is chump change. when I called to find out where it was
4 to 5 days later, I was told that it was shipped surface to date I still
don't have it.  If U told me one thing this time and done the opposite than
what else might have U represented on this issue and what future ones will U ditto.  stop this unusual procedure or U won't have to worry about it in the future. Pathetic to say the least.     Richard</review>

It was a group effort to convince our parents that it would benefit all of us for them to have a medical alarm system.  My sister started by finding Bay Alarm Medical on-line, my brother made the initial call, I made a follow-up call, and my sister-in-law helped our parents complete the transaction.  Everyone at Bay Alarm Medical worked as a team to help our family enable our parents to be as independent and safe as they can be.  Thank you!.< /Text>

Set up was very simple although I had one small glitch. My base unit was sending the "help" signal but we couldn't hear each other talk. Bay did the right thing by calling 911 and then my phone, but they were able to stop the 911 visit when the problem came to light (one day it will be funny). The tech and service personnel are very helpful and professional.  The only complaint I have is the difficulty in getting the wristband on.  I have very small wrists and finally had to cut inches off the band to get it to work at all.  It's still very difficult to get on and fastened with one hand. Seems like a simple Velcro band would be a much better solution, especially with arthritic hands.< /Text>

I thought that this was a good idea. I encouraged my Dad who is in his 90's to get it. He had it for almost a  year and it alerted the call center a couple of times but fortunately they were mistakes until the last time where he fell and the ambulance team arrived with the firetruck. They arrived and my Dad answered the door in obvious disarray. They left and never informed the emergency contact that they had gone to the house later that day he was found lying in the garage was taken to the hospital and now is in a skilled nursing facility. All of this could have been avoided if they had just called the emergency contact to let us know. So system works but the back up is not any good, beware.<//Review>

The representative was cordial and patient, and answered all questions fully and clearly.  A very satisfactory experience, on the whole.  We have had very good reports of the product and are looking forward to attaching it to our father, who has reluctantly agreed that he needs it.< /Text>

If so, we would not recommend calling our office if you were "lying on the floor" and would certainly recommend you press your help button. Please be advised, due to COVID-19 our staff has had to make changes to abide by state recommendations, so we are experiencing a higher than usual call volume and hold time to our main office. We sincerely apologize for this.  If this was a connection issue and the long wait time was regarding our device, we would love to have one of our customer care or tech support representatives assist you in troubleshooting and testing the device. Connection to our dispatch centers are not and should not be effected by COVID-19.

<review>Yesterday I had an online chat with one of Bay Alarm's representatives, Kelly, who was very helpful and patient in answering all of the questions that I raised.  Today Jessica helped me sign up for the program for my brother, who lives out of state, and I appreciated her expertise, as well. I can't yet comment on the product but will be happy to report on that once it is received, hopefully in a few days.< /review><gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//gmap_id></record>

The CSR was very helpful and  in deciding what service was best for my dad's needs.  She was thorough and very pleasant. So far so good.  I am looking forward to having the medical alert system in place for peace of mind when my dad is at home alone.<//review>

We are sorry to hear your wait time is long, that does seem longer than what we are seeing but we will take a look to ensure this is not a problem moving forward. Please keep in mind our office hours for Customer Service and Tech Support are Mon-Fri 6AM-6PM PST, Sat-Sun 8AM-4:30PM PST. And of course our Emergency dispatch center is available 24/7 including holidays. In regards to the notices, we will contact the user, biller, and contact list if there are any concerns regarding the system, such as a power loss. However, if the power loss is restored and successfully connected within a minute, we do not contact the customer due to the fact that everything is working properly. We will absolutely contact you if we see something concerning. As a precaution, we always advise our customers to test the system at least once per month by pushing the button, allowing the alarm to go off and connect to dispatch and kindly letting them know you are safe and it is just a test. If you need assistance with testing, please give our tech support team a call. Thank you for your time.'}<//resp><Date>1552565543681<//Date></record>

<date>1552907791720<//date><rating>2<//rating><review>Our confidence with Bay Medical has significantly dropped after an incident last week.  My 86-year old mother was testing the alarm she wears on her neck.  The monitor had malfunctioned and prevented verbal communication between Bay Medical and my mother, resulting in paramedics unnecessarily being called.  The Bay Medical operator failed to give paramedics my mother's apartment number and did not relay that she had a lockbox or the lockbox number to paramedics.  Had the apartment office not been open at the time of the incident, paramedics would not have been able to locate my mother.  If this had been a real emergency, my mother could have died.  There is no room for error.  Bay Medical is a lifeline to their clients, and all information to reach a client in a timely manner MUST be relayed to paramedics.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was having problems with setting off my alarm inadvertently and each time the fire dept showed up because with my hearing deficit I did not hear the Bay Associates response.  We were able to work out a way to bypass the problem to my satisfaction and relief.  I was pleased that the response to the alarm each time it was sent to Bay was perfect and the problems were  mine.  Thanks, Bay!</review>

I wanted to like this company based on reviews and pricing, but after reading the contract in detail, I am not able to.  READ THE CONTRACT!  Paragraph #4 states that "WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE PROMPTNESS OF THE CENTER'S RESPONSE TO A SIGNAL" and later it states "WE MAY BE NEGLIGENT IN PROVIDING THE SERVICE , AND MAY FAIL TO PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE" - what are we hiring them for if they can't warranty that they will be in fact promptly responding to an alert signal!  I would be hiring them for one thing - Personal Emergency Response System" and that is was they call their system and they can't guarantee they will do it!  Makes absolutely no sense.</review>
<rating>1</rating><Response>{'time': 1507827475827, 'text': 'Hi Peggy – Thank you for taking the time to express your feedback and concerns. We definitely understand your frustration, especially because you are doing your best to protect your loved one. In regards to our terms and services, it would be irresponsible on our part to promise 100% guarantee promptness, when our UL-Certified U.S. based dispatchers contact your local 911 personnel and cannot control the promptness of your local 911 personnel, as well as possible situations out of our control such as connection issues due to service towers, phone lines, power, etc. that could affect the promptness to respond to a signal. These are standard business practices for the medical alert industry, we understand it can be overwhelming, but as a family-owned company that has been around for over 70 years, we can guarantee that we will provide the best training to all of our employees in order for them to do their best when assisting your loved ones. Whether you decide to go with Bay Alarm Medical or another medical alert company, what is most important to us is that your loved ones stay protected. Please feel free to give us a call if you have any further questions or concerns.

<Text>The customer service representatives are nice, but I’m very unhappy with the delivery. I ordered the product for my grandpa on Monday the 28th of Jan. Vincent, the person I ordered from told me it would arrive within 2-3 days because we are both in California. I told him it was needed immediately and asked if I could pay to rush it, but he said that wouldn’t be necessary.

One week later I finally called on 4 Feb to ask where it was since it still hadn’t arrived. The customer service rep told me it wouldn’t arrive until at least the 6th. Apparently the order wasn’t even provided to USPS until 5 days after I ordered it.

I don’t know how the service is since we still haven’t received the medical alert package. But I’m not impressed with the delivery.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I must say that I was skeptical about this program at first because there have been so many scammers calling my Mother's home peddling this type of product claiming that she won it, or a caring family member ordered one for her. That type of telephone activity gave me a bad taste in my mouth so I wasn't sure who to trust. With that being said, I knew with my elderly diabetic Mother living alone that I needed to do something to help deal with the high risk of her falling when she is alone. I did my homework, I decided on Bay Alarm and boy am I glad I did. It was money well spent. She collapsed one night due to low blood sugar and fortunately she was wearing her pendant. When the dispatch center tried to make contact with her to see if she was alright and she didn't respond they sent the paramedics. This one act very likely saved her life because her blood sugar was so low she could have gone into a diabetic coma. The paramedics were able to get her to a hospital and get her stabilized and she came back home that same night. THANK YOU  BAY ALARM! It is money well spent for sure!<//Review>

Bay Alarm Medical is a must-have for elderly parents or grandparents.  My mind is at ease knowing Bay Alarm is always monitoring my 85 year old mother.  Although Mom lives in an apartment in my sister's house, Mom is alone most of the time while my sister and her husband travel.  The power goes off occasionally and Bay Alarm is calling out to my Mom to make sure she is okay.  Mom loves knowing that they check on her.  I have to give Bay Alarm 5 stars....they are courteous, professional, and always on the job!  Thanks Bay Alarm for watching out for my Mom!!<//review>

I purchased this service for a family member who  uses a walker  and is very frightened of falling while alone. I researched companies  and their customer satisfaction  rating and this company stood out.
They made the entire process easy  and  the monthly fee is buying tons of peace of mind..so worth every cent.< /text>

Received messages 6 days in a row that my battery was low.  I replied the 2nd time and was assured problem was solved.  The other times I was not available so they called my 1st and 2nd contacts. One was my daughter 500 miles away!  Finally tech dept figured it was my necklace and ordered a new one.  Two days after I returned the old necklace they called again and I was not available so they called my first two contacts again (for the fourth time).
I certainly don’t need the stress nor does my family. Your employees need more training or your automated equipment needs to be updated.</Review>

When we first obtained service for my mom, it was because my father had it before he passed away. We knew we could trust Bay Alarm Medical, so we started up the service again for my mom. There was a bit of a learning curve, as Mom would accidentally hit the button, but the professionals of Bay Alarm were always there for her, whether it was just talking to us to make sure medical attention was not needed, or EMT's arriving quickly to transport Mom to the Emergency Room.
Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical for your amazing service!< /Review>

Bay Alarm has impeccable service. My mother, hesitant in always wearing her 'necklace' fell in her garage. Good fortune had it that she just put her alarm necklace on before going outside. The chain of events brought her immediate paramedic help which also included my brother and me receiving word of the incident, where he raced to the scene (He lived locally; I was vacationing in Hawaii). Fortunately my mother wasn't badly hurt. The lesson she learned.... ALWAYS wear your alarm necklace. She now never takes it off.< /review>

I was researching medical alert devices for my parents and discovered that Bay Alarm had the highest rating and in all of my dealings with Bay Alarm, I can definitely see why. Despite some unexpected delays on our part, the Bay Alarm representative, Shyra ,was extremely patient & helpful with the process. Very thorough explanations were given to all my questions.< /Text>

<review>Bay alarm is very efficient.
I'm learning how to test my unit even in remote areas .
If you don't connect,  be sure to contact them when you do get into a clear reception area to confirm that it was a test .

I called to see how to return the Bay Alarm equipment. I was given specific instructions.  I called back on 4/26/18 and spoke with Eduardo to check  if it was received. It was. My expectancy is that this the great service will continue when the equipment return will be reflected on my bill.<//text>

<text>Working with Rachelle to set up my account was fun as well as informative and productive. She took a lot of time with me, as if there were no people waiting on hold. How unusual is that nowadays? I DID interview other companies over about a week, and as a newbie to Bay Alarm, I can't predict the longterm relationship, but at this point I am very glad I chose Bay Alarm.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>The product was to be delivered to J and paid for by B. The shipping label was incorrectly printed  to B at J's address. The product was returned-to-sender since B didn't live at J's apartment. Bay Medical was very kind about acknowledging the  problem and resending it at no charge to B but it would have been better to get it right the first time.

<Review>I was playing cards when the receptionist here at Village Green ran in and asked if I pushed my button since the paramedics were in my unit!  I ran up to my unit and there must have been 9 paramedics in it.  My button was on my nightstand and hadn't been pushed!.  I call Bay Alarm by pushing the button and explained what happened.  Anyway,  nobody has an explanation for this.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1549909865675, 'text': "Hi Jeanine - Thank you for your feedback. We are very happy to hear you are okay and it was just a false alarm. We are glad to see how quickly our dispatch center contacted local EMTs. We understand it can seem alarming, especially if it is a false alarm but it sure is great to know how fast our team works along with how fast EMTs are! It's very uncommon to get a false alarm if the button was not triggered in some way, but we will continue to look into this.

<Review>I received an email today stating that my account was in arrears. It gave me a number to call to fix the problems. When I called the number I was put on hold and after a while was told I could leave a call back number without losing my place in line. I went through the process but nothing happened after clicking the completion button. I sat for a period of time to see if things would move along and they did not. I called back and hung on to the line until someone finally answered the call and we resolved the problem. Why isn't there a program that scans credit card end dates and notifies the card holder of the problem in advance of having our accounts in arrears? It would seem that the number of calls would go down drastically.< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had to cancel my credit card for this account due to unrelated fraudulent activity. When the renewal came up the charge was declined of course. Later, when I put in the replacement card info, BAM did not automatically apply the charge to the new credit card.  It took a short phone call to resolve the issue. However, they should fix this procedure. It's the only reason I give them 4 rather than 5 stars.< /review>< Pics>

Bay Alarm Medical has far exceeded my expectations by providing my family not only dependable and outstanding service for the past four years, but much needed peace of mind.  Over that time, they've professionally delivered as promised by facilitating EMS responses and notifying family members on nearly a dozen occasions.  Just had a wonderful interaction with Chauntene in Customer Support who set me up with a new agreement for continued service. I definitely made the right choice going with BAM!</Review>

Wonderful service, including help with equipment when there were glitches. The paramedics showed up in a hurry when mom called them with her button, and all of us slept better knowing she could call.
Courteous telephone help, and (it seems to me) a very fair price.</Review>

Allyssa and Rachelle were both wonderful  Another woman I spoke to on Tuesday December 5 was not good.  Talked too fast and did not give accurate information.  So I asked for another assistant.  I got Allyssa who I had spoken to in the past.  She was wonderful.  Very patient with explanations.  Did not hurry me at all.  All her information was consistent.  She needs to get a raise!< /text>

So far, so good.  Ordered Moms equipment on Monday and it arrived on Friday.  Got the system in place with two red emergency buttons placed in her kitchen and bathroom today (Sat.).  Tested the system via calling thru the emergency button and also had Mom do it to see what it sounded like.  Very nice people that were great in reassuring her all is well!< /text>

I received a call from their customer service and was rudely informed I must return the equipment and they must have it in their hands on June 12 2016 or I will be charged a years service billed to my credit card  account.  My contract states I have 10  days to return the equipment at the end of the agreement which is June 21. before i will be liable for a charge to my credit card account.

<rating>5</rating><text>Even thought we never used them, bay Alarm Medical was peace of mind.  After my Dad died I felt my mom should not be alone, but she did not want to live with her kids, she wanted to stay home.  So Bay Alarm was the compromise. My Mom had the system for two years until she past.  She never had to used the services, but there were a few oops when the alarm was bumped or grate grandkids pushed the button.  Bay Alarm was always there. Never upset always understanding.  When it was time to return the parts, that was very easy, no hassle, just a phone call and they had me set up for the return. This was great peace of mind for me and it aloud my mom to stay at home.  No regrets using this system.< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The customer service at Bay Alarm Medical is truly amazing.  It is refreshing to be able to speak with a representative that is knowledgable and compassionate.  Rachelle answered all questions and assisted me with finding the system that best suited my mother's needs.<//Review>

I spoke with Casey in Technical Help(?).  She understood the nature of the problem at once, a somewhat complicated matter which she helped me to work my way through.  I greatly appreciated her intelligent competence and helpfulness.<//Review>

<text>It was awful!!!  Mom fell and because she tried to get up, the alarm was canceled.  I was led to believe that if she fell, you would call.  I found out today that it was not true.  While she wasn't injured badly, she was very scared.  Luckily, I had gone over on my own.  Otherwise, she would have been laying there for a long time, NO THANKS TO YOU!!!!  Will be looking for another company as soon as I can do the research.  Your policy should be IF YOU FALL, WE WILL CALL!!!!  Not turn off the alarm!!  What if she had broken a bone?  She could have been moving in agony and you would have ignored that.  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL!!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1554746337279, 'text': "Hi John & Peggy Moore - First and foremost, we are so sorry to hear about mom's fall and we understand how scary and stressful it is for her and the family. We are glad to hear she did not suffer from any injuries. Although the fall detection is built in to detect falls, it does come with a push button for loved ones to push in an emergency if they fall or get hurt in any way that doesn't cause them to go unconscious. Sudden movement after impact on the button will cancel out the call because it is treated as a false alarm - if it didn't, there would be numerous false alarms throughout the day with every single movement. We never advise anyone to attempt to move and get up after a fall and always encourage loved ones to push the button or stay put and it will signal a fall and set the alarm off. We are terribly sorry that happened to mom and your family and are happy to address any further concerns or questions to better assist you. Thank you."}<//Response>

I was having trouble with COPD breathing and finally pushed my alert button
An operator finally answered after 10 rings and contacted emergency paramedics  He told me that he would be right back to me and put me on hold.  I waited for a long time until a recording told me that I was disconnected.<//Review>

{'time': 1568834641540, 'text': 'Hi Nola - We are terribly sorry to hear you had trouble breathing and the added worry/frustration you experienced. We were able to look at your account details and see that EMS was dispatched after your button was pressed and arrived to the home. It looks like our emergency dispatcher had trouble reconnecting back with you because the button was continuously pressed, which kept restarting the signal over and disrupting the connection. We are very sorry you experienced that, but we are glad to know our dispatchers were able to get EMS to you quickly. We are going to have a Customer Care representative give you a call to walk you through a test, so you have a better understanding of the process during an emergency. We definitely want to make sure you are safe and comfortable! We hope you are feeling much better and never have to experience that again. Talk to you soon.\n\nThank you,\nBay Alarm Medical'}< /Resp>

I wear the wrist alarm, confident that I am protected at my home.  I never take it off, even when I know I am out of range and have my cell phone.  Once the unit was accidentally called when it was moved and the man who  promptly answered was very understanding.  I am totally satisfied with the service, feeling secure and safe.<//review>

I am very happy with my alarm!  I have used it twice.  Once for them to get me out of the floor and the last time I fell and hit my head and ended up with a brain bleed which was a very urgent call and they stepped up to the plate and got here quickly after being notified by you!

Ikera in customer service was GREAT to work with! She was very thorough and understanding. She even  called my mom and walked her through the placement of the unit in her house (alas, to no avail). Afterwards she  called me and recommended that because there is no land line in Mom's house we'd be better off returning the unit and canceling the service. Thank Heaven they have a 30 day risk free trial!   :-)
Wonderful customer service! I'm disappointed that it wouldn't work for my mom, who lives in Truth Or Consequences, NM. The cell signal just wasn't strong enough.    :-(< /Review>

The service provide by Bay Alarm and the responsiveness is very good.

BE WARNED: All of their contracts are auto-renew and there is no courtesy reminder or notice prior to renewal. And Bay Alarm has a strict NO REFUND policy, regardless what the you speak with has to say.

So if there's a chance that you won't want the system renewed, cancel before your renewal date or you will be paying for a year of service that you won't use.

Just another way of staying in business I guess - stick it to the customer.</review>

Everything is as promised.
We used this company for 4 years and had mostly positive experience.  We had issues with hardware a couple of times, but Bay Alarm Medical responded quickly and fixed the issues.</Review>

First, I placed the order by phone on Feb 2.  I had to call three times before it was finally shipped.  I completed the paperwork with our contact information and mailed it Feb 12.  Another two calls, and was told the information may be there, but has not been put into your system.  The person was very helpful and put my information in over the phone and told me we were all set up.  I did a test call and had to push the button three times.  The unit kept saying :  Calling For Help.  Several minutes passed before anyone came on and asked if help was needed.  I expected to have someone answer a call within a minute.  Will try a test again tomorrow and see if the response time improves.</text>

<text>I used this service when my sister was dying of Cancer. We contacted them of her death promptly  and of course equipment was not being used. They continued to bill, when I was contacted in April about equipment return, her son took care of it immediately. I think case closed. August I get a bill from a collection agency. I don't know what happened, I've spoken to them at length to no avail. A collection a year to the month after the death. I can pay it but what a classless act, I'm more sad about this company than I am my sister's death.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I ordered two lanyards and only received one.  The customer service agreed to send the second button.  Thus 4 stars.  We're just starting our 30 day trial, so the star count could go down.

Revisited the review because (yes I know it sounds lame but...) one of our dogs chewed one of the lanyard alarm buttons, shorted it out so that it continuously alerted.  The third time I called tech support, Aaron answered and in minute had the problem fixed.  The rating is still 4 for the company, but 5 for Aaron.<//text><rate>4< /rate>< Date>

I ordered Bay Alarm medical alert system for my 90 year old mother who lives alone and stubbornly refuses to leave her home and come live with me or my brother.   She has had the system for over a year now and it has been a godsend, especially since I live out of town.  I added the fall detection option and it has been a lifesaver.  It really works!!!  And everyone at Bay Alarm whom  I have needed to speak with at different times, could not have been more helpful and nice.  I am so pleased I chose Bay Alarm  for my precious mother!< /text>

The Bay Alarm Medical system was very easy to set-up. Impressed with the velcro fasteners for the remote "Help" button we installed in my Mother's bathrooms. We initially experienced some distortion that made it difficult to understand the Bay Alarm operator. We were immediately transferred to the customer service personnel. Within a few minutes the technician had corrected the problem. All the staff we interacted with were very professional and friendly. Our family feels very secure about entrusting our Mother's safety with the Bay Alarm organization.</Review>

<review>I tested our medical alarm system for the first today and it went well.   After the test, I tried to make a call on the telephone.    There was a loud noise and the phone was not usable.  I used a cellphone to call customer service, selecting tech support.   The technician asked for a brief summary of what was occurring and then asked me to press the reset button on the back of the unit and then try again to make a call.   Problem solved - easily.< /review>< pictures>

I found the customer service to be excellent during the inquiry & ordering processes.  Everyone was helpful, patient and informative.  The only negative was being told that if a storm or other electric surge damaged the base equipment that we would be responsible to pay $300 unless purchasing equipment insurance against damage for $7 extra dollars per month. . . Really?  A power surge? Just why would that constitute us damaging the equipment? However, I do feel like the customer service was the best and that is of most concern to me. Bottom line is I want my mother to get a kind and patient voice if she ever needs help.< /Text>

Also I asked about the battery life and was told there was no need to change this one they would be able to detect when it signal is getting weak and would replace it.  But reading the long document they had me sign it seems to say i’m responsible to change it?  Still some confusion on my side, we’ll see.<//review>< GmapID>

<Response>{'time': 1508791586745, 'text': 'Hi Marti - We are sorry that you feel uneasy about our service agreement. To be clear, this is not locking you into a contract with us. Customers can cancel at any time without penalty fees. The main base unit is leased to customers, so customers do need to return that back to our office in working condition in order to close the account. Aside from that, we do not charge fees for cancelling. If there are every battery issues or a low battery, no problem. We are more than happy to take care of that for our customers to ensure they are protected. Please give us a call with your questions and concerns regarding our terms and service agreement so we can help you better understand. Again, it is never our intention to hide any information. We are always upfront with our customers, especially in regards to the process and costs. We look forward to helping you! Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical'}< /Response>< rating>

<Text>First class. Bay Alarm Medical was ranked first among medical alert companies by AARP magazine when I was shopping for my elderly  mother about ten years ago.

We decided to go with the combination of home landline and mobile GPS, this way we know she is just the press of a button away from getting help.  Knowing there will now be a lock box on the premises that a medic can access, and let themselves in to help my mom, gives me great peace of mind.  She was recently dizzy and an ambulance was sent to her house, but she had to go down the flight of stairs to let them in.  That will never happen again, thanks to Bay Alarm.  I called the number on the website, and Carlos, the person who helped me was more than helpful to answer our questions and get us started.  It couldn't have been any easier!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>My mom and dad wear the emergency call lanyards with fall detection.  I also have wall buttons.   Every time I call Bay Alarm I am greeted by a friendly, professional person who could not be more pleasant.   One time I had to place the Bay Alarm employee on hold so I could field questions from my dad's doctor.  Five minutes later I was back and Bay Alarm was sitll on hold patiently waiting.   This place is the best.   In particular Selicia was very nice to me.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

{'time': 1556315829293, 'text': 'HI Lawrence - Thank you for your honest feedback. We are sorry to hear about your frustrations and have taken it to the appropriate team. We are sorry for any confusion and miscommunication on our end. We currently have a sale, which displays the original price crossed out with the sale price displayed. The full free shipping details are clarified on the pricing page, but we understand the confusion it may cause for our customers and are always happy and transparent with any questions or concerns. Although we would love to, we cannot apply every discount to a single order. If a customer prefers one discount over another, we are more than happy to apply that. It looks like our Customer Service representative assisted you and you received the best rate plus the shipping cost waived on your order. If you could please clarify further what makes us a 1-star company, we would love to hear more feedback to better understand. All the best, Bay Alarm Medical'}</response>

<text>Customer service clerk was polite and prices were as advertised on the website.
The website also stated that free shipping was with the order and the website also stated that AARP, AMAC , USAA, etc discount were available.  I was told by Valerie this was not true since I was getting the sale price. (Nowhere on the website did I see anything about the prices being on sale.) When I questioned her about the shipping cost and it being contrary to what was on the website I was put on hold for her to check in about this. She came back on and gave me free shipping. When I again inquired about the advertised website discounts (AARP, AMAC, USAA) I was again told that they did not apply here since I was getting the sale price.
I reluctantly went ahead with the order. If this proves to be a problem with this company (advertised perks that really aren't available, false advertising, misinformation on their website) I will cancel my service and look for another medical alert company that actually follows what is on their website.<//text><GmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//GmapID><name>Lawrence Real<//name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The individual agents that I spoke with regarding problems with my base unit (maybe) were invariably polite and friendly and attempting to help me. We have currently narrowed the problem down but not completely solved it yet. The reason that I gave four stars instead of five is that this problem has been ongoing, off and on, for months. There may well be more than one problem, so maybe it’s not the same problem, but I have had multiple false alarms, two of which resulted in the EMS actually appearing at my house when I had not even received a call. It’s also possible that some of the problem originates in my phone system, so maybe Bay Alarm didn’t know how to resolve that, of course. But the fact remains that this problem has persisted for a long time. Otherwise, I am happy with the service.< /review>

<text>I received incredibly poor customer service today when attempting to get a simple billing problem resolved.  Long story short -  the person I spoke with said they'd have to speak with my dying Grandmother, whom they have NEVER spoken with, to get our problem resolved.  I respect any effort toward consumer protection; however, I opened this account, I pay the bill, I have made 100% of the phone calls and emails about it's maintenance, etc.  Never once has anyone spoken with my Grandmother regarding her unit, or requested to do so -- until today, when I was told a woman who barely knows her name must speak with a customer service rep to have a simple billing issue resolved.... for the bill that I pay.  Unbelievable.  When the rep I spoke with couldn't resolve my issue I asked to speak with her superior, to which she responded "they can't help you either."  After a long hold I was told they'd return my call today.  8 hours later, no returned call.  Additionally, our unit was defective, which would never cause me to write a bad review -- things happen and technology fails, but after today's incident I felt the need to share in an effort to save someone else the headache of this level of ignorance.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Several months ago I fell in my bedroom.  Knowing I could not get myself up from the floor I pushed my button.   Some one answered almost immediately and ask me what was the problem.  Shortly after  the EMTS were at my door.  Since my door was locked, they proceeded to my lock box outside and were able to open the door.  I was on my feet in less than a half hour from the time I fell.   The quick response to my fall was solved promptly and with no problems.  Without my Bay Alarm my daughter and son-in-law would have had to travel fifteen miles to rescue me.  I am thankful for this service.<//text>

My mother in law had the device for almost 2 years. In that time she needed to push the fob button twice and it worked wonderfully. We had the option to have Bay Alarm call us first. Once she fell out of bed and couldn't get up. The TV was on too loud and she couldn't hear the operator so the operator called us. Very nice system. My only big complaint (hence 4 stars, not 5) was you PURCHASE the GPS system. So when you need to replace the non-replaceable battery you have to pay for a whole new device.....$250.   Ouch.<//Review>

<text>I don't know how, but apparently my alarm button was activated without my knowledge.  Unlike other times when the button was pressed accidentally, no contact was attempted by the monitor--at least not one that I could hear (I was in my kitchen at dinner when the incident occcurred.)  The first I knew of it, my  building manager and the monitor's staff had opened my door and entered my apartment, without my knowledge.< /text>< Time>

Jessica, who handled my call, did a great job explaining how the system works and the options available.  She was patient with me and did not rush me.

She helped we with getting me setup with the system and stayed on the line to help with the electronic signing of the agreement document.</Review>

<text>I am extremely happy with Bay Alarm.  We subscribed to the service after my father had a stroke and my mom fell and broke her arm.  It has been a sense of security for me and my two sister's who live out of the area.  Since getting the alarm there have been two additional instances that it has come in handy with.  One my mom fell and broke her hip.  I appreciate the service and the options of either the necklace monitor or the arm band.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<time>1516470408418< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I don't have first hand knowledge of the service and don't normally post reviews like this but was so taken back with how they handled the report of my mothers death that I felt compelled to post this.  Reading through some of the other reviews it seems to be a common practice to charge people even after they're deceased.  I called them to notify them of my mother's death and stop the service but was told that until the equipment is returned that they would continue to bill us.  I thought naturally there would be some grace period to return the equipment; even big cable companies give you that benefit, however,  was told no there is no grace period provided to return the equipment.  I tried to explain that her family won't be able to do this for a couple of weeks given the distance that we live from where the equipment is but was told that didn't matter we would be charged until it was returned irrespective of whether anyone was using the service.  Like others have mentioned I was subjected to speaking with a young inexperienced person with poor customer service skills.  Shameful!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>We loved the service and support we received through the first year of our contract, and the response team in testing the equipment that first year after initial installation and even after the Renewal and into the second year.
However,
My mother who we purchased this for, passed away one month before the third renewal and we have received no end of grief with paperwork, etc.
Even though this is simply declining to renew for the third year, they insisted upon letters (separate letters 1) for the home base and pendants, and 2) as second letter for the GPS mobile unit we also purchased), and return of ALL equipment (even though we paid for it all in the initial contract which only addresses return of the equipment for EARLY TERMINATION), and threats to bill our credit cards (I assume for the full year renewal) if we did not comply with all of these undocumented requirements before the automatic renewal date.
It is not enough dealing with the passing of a loved one without then being threatened with charges for another full year AFTER they passed.<//text>< name>

<Review>Rapid phone response if testing device with move to new city..or accidentally sounding the alarm.  Staff has always been prompt and couteous and verify I am okay and do not need assistance.  Devices work as described and offer a variety of safe choices for what to wear in shower (or other water), what to wear to bed (to avoid choaking hazzard) what to wear if you are leaving the house for a drive or just out in the yard.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Very unhappy with this service because the dispatchers were not able to hear me well.  It was very stressful repeating everything 3- 4 times.  It did not meet my need for peace of mind and reliability.

Customer support was not able to solve the problem, so I decided to return it .< /text>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Luckily, we haven't had to use Bay Alarm for any emergency or service yet. However during setup I had my phone line plugged into wrong hole and without knowing, I was alerting Bay Alarm Medical and they were sending help! During this time, I called them on my cellphone to have them walk me through setup. They were very, very concerned, polite and helpful even as I answered the door and saw the EMT's (who were very understanding!) standing there!  Well, we got it all set up and tested and experienced the great service all with no emergency involved!
I will recommend Bay Alarm Medical to anyone I know needing a service like this!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I looked at services for my 80 year old mother who had both knees replaced. They paid a year in advance and used the service while she recovered. They received a 3-4 page contract in small print which was signed and returned. They had no more use for the service. Upon there paid in advance anniversary there credit card was charged for another year, that same day i called to say the service was not needed and could they refund the charge. I was told no they don't do refunds and to cancel they had to return the equipment which they will do. ANYONE CONSIDERING USING BAY ALARM BEWARE OF THIS AS MOST 80 YEAR OLDS GO ON TRUST. THEY USED THE SERVICE AND PAID FOR IT, HAVE NO MORE USE AND WILL NOT BE REFUNDED THERE $263.00 DOLLARS. ANOTHER COMPANY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ELDERLY.  A GREAT STORY FOR 60 MINUTES OR 20/20 TO SEE HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAPPENS.</review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

I signed up for Bay Alarm for my mother-in-law several years ago and it seemed to be set up properly and on time - although she never used it.  In June, 2016, she passed away.  The next month, Bay Alarm put through an automatic annual renewal and I called to inform them that she had passed away.  I was told that once the renewal is processed, there is nothing that they could do and that I needed to return the equipment or face an additional charge - as they were going to close the account but not provide a pro-rated reimbursement. I returned the equipment along with a copy of her death certificate - but no response from them.  Now my brother-in-law needs an alarm system as he suffered a severe brain injury - and needless to say, I will not be contacting Bay Alarm.<//text>

It's been so reassuring to both my grandmother and me to have her safe when she's alone, since she wanted her independence and didn't want to move yet.  I was worried, so I researched companies and decided Bay Alarm Medical was the best choice.  Shas used her button about five times.  Each time the company has been extremely responsive.  She has recently had more trouble.  She couldn't get out of her chair, so she hadn't eaten all day.  She finally pushed the button.  The EMTs came and helped her right away, using the info we provided to find the hidden house key. Then they helped her, fixed her some food, and even picked up a few groceries.   Now we are moving her in with my aunt.  Because of this service my grandmother was able to extend her independence, and they kept her safe.  I'm so thankful that this service exists, and I gave five stars because she really felt safe with the responsiveness of the company.<//Text>

He was having difficulty with dizziness and I was afraid he would fall and get hurt. So far we have not had any emergencies. The alert has been accidentally set off but it is easily reset and if we get a call the person on the other end is never upset with a false alert. They explain they would rather have that, but they are there for us if we need them. This is a good company.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This company has poor practices.  After agreeing to annual renewal paid by credit card in May, my mother passed away in June.  Although they agreed to discontinue service, they would not refund the balance of the unused balance (10/12) for the prepaid year.    Advise anyone who needs this service not to sign on to annual agreement.  This is not the first year of the agreement but beginning the third, this was just plain wrong to take advantage of a 100 year old widower who could use the money.< /Text>

<Review>Be very careful.  They have a lot of fine print and continue to bill you after your loved one has passed away.  I was charged $300 after I told them she had passed away.  I had to change my credit card to keep them from billing me the next year.</Review>< Pictures>

I've used the system once when I couldn't locate my husband for help. The response was immediate and a great relief to me. Since I am handicapped
it is wonderful to know help is so quick and courteous. Thank you!< /review>

<review>You are supposed to test the device monthly.  I noticed that gradually over time, when I would test the system, the time for them to respond was getting longer and longer.  Then, one day I pushed the button, and nothing happened.  I was going to restart the device and try again, but my family pulled me away for something.  We ended up going to the grocery store and doing some other tasks.  About 2.5 hours after I had pushed the button (and in fact, I had forgotten all about it), I hear this voice in the other room saying, "hello, hello, is anyone there, do you need assistance?"  I enter that room to find the voice coming from my Bay Alarm device.  I was in shock; they were just then responding to the button push from 2.5 hours ago.  Imagine if my house were on fire, or I were having a medical emergency!  I cancelled the service pretty promptly after that.</review><user_id>106973359236348977347</user_id><Response>{'time': 1471288106290, 'text': "Hi Christopher - Thank you so much for taking the time to review us.

< Review>
I set off a false alarm by laying my neck pendant flat on the cabinet and leaving the house. I had been warned about this happening, but totally forgot..I was outside when I heard a voice coming from inside the house. When I opened the door he was saying "Charlotte, I can't hear you". I had no way of calling to report that this was a false alarm. I tried to talk back to the  Help box, but that didn't work. (Does Bay alarm have such a number I could have called on my cel phone?) The paramedics arrived right away. I found Bay Alarm's customer service number and the nice, very patient technition straightened everything out. Thanks Bay Alarm!</Review>

We purchased this for my father just 11 months ago, and they have been a lifesaver for us. This system is such a good thing for the elderly, I recommend everyone to take advantage of this and use it, you will not be disappointed nor will your parents. Thank you Bay alarm!<//Review>

<review>Our experience was ok. There were a couple of issues. The speaker on the equipment is loud enough, but there was a lot of static and very hard to understand the lady on the other end , she also talked too fast. In dealing with older people, you should talk slower and be more clear.
Calling customer service was very helpful. They tried to make an adjustment , so I’ll try it out next time I’m visiting my aunt.
Another issue was that the EMS didn’t go to the door that was specified. It was ok this time because it was a false alarm. But in the future, I hope they listen and follow the directions more carefully.<//review>< user>

<Text>Carlos was very polite to me and gave me the info I needed.  Since we tried to purchase this system on line and we got no response when we hit submit, I had Carlos check to see if there was already an account set up.  He gladly did that.  He took all the info necessary and was clear in his speech and speed and answered my questions happily.  He sounded like a great guy.  When I had to call BAM back I asked for Carlos and since Carlos was busy my number was taken and Carlos called back very quickly so he could help make my purchase.  I will gladly ask for Carlos
to get any future service that I need with this BAM system.  I rate his service as high as it can be rated!<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /gmapID></record>

They refused to refund the funds even though we cancelled and sent back the unit as requested with the proper post marked date. If you like paying for three months for a unit that you no longer have or need this is the company for you. When called to refund my card they insisted on a tracking number, although the parcel would have a post marked date they said it did not. Their cancellation e-mail did NOT require proof of mailing or a tracking number, just a post marked date, which ALL parcels would have.<//Text>< pics>

Casey at Bay Alarm Medical was great, a 5-star.

DocuSign and Google were terrible.  I wasted nearly half an hour with them before I could Rate and Review.</Review>

I am extremely dissatisfied with the service for this company. I will never recommend this company to anyone in my community needing a medical alert. I truly believe I was cheated out of my money. When I received the medical devices, there were several false alarms, which woke my grandma up in the middle of the night. This prompted me to end services. I sent an email disconnecting services, and I promptly sent the devices back. I received a bill months later for 3 months of disconnected services. I would gladly pay if there the services were active, but it makes absolutely no sense to pay for 3 months AFTER I returned all the equipment. Whenever I called to get this matter settled, they kept sending me to the debt collector. I sent evidence of my email that I ended services (which is also dated) and even with this proof, they said I still had to pay. Absolutely ridiculous and worst mistake I made for my grandma.</Text>

I selected Bay Alarm Medical because they offer services in different languages.  My mother speaks Japanese.  Unfortunately my mother has accidentally pressed the button - either her wrist band or her GPS.  The customer service is excellent.  They go down the list of emergency contacts and if they are unable to contact anyone, they will send out the fire department.  They are on top of it and I'm glad I have service with them for my mother.< /Review>

I carry the device all the time. This makes my family relax and not be concerned when I take long walks alone. I feel secure. I have never needed to push the alarm.

I find the cord around my neck bothersome. It chaffs so I don't wear it. I keep it by my bed. I think the bracelet looks bulky. I have never used it.

You informed me one night that my land line was not working. I think it was around l: 00 a,,m I checked all my phones which were as they were supposed to be. Charter was informed by you and soon my land line was working. I would not have received this quick attention if I had called so I appreciate your service. Karlan Strong< /text>

<text>Had to use this service a couple of times.  Response time is great.  The only problem I had was when I received a call that the button was pushed, I didn't recognize the phone number and didn't answer the call.  I later checked my phone messages and panicked.  Otherwise, recommend this system to those in need, especially to the independent elderly folks.</text>< Resp>

<review>I called to ask a question about a voicemail I received.  I was on hold for a while, and they offered to let me put in my phone number for a callback.  After I pressed the pound button, I was disconnected.  However, I called back and was connected to tech support who helped me.  So don’t get discouraged if your first try isn’t connected.< /review>< Time>

Representative Corina was very courteous and helpful. She resolved the confusion promptly.

I must say it is odd that two duplicate DocuSign document emails got "accidentally & erroneously" sent in the first place. Makes things very confusion for customers....especially ones that don't deal with electronic document signing on a regular basis.<//review>

< review>
Handicapped and needed alarm unit prior to my wife's leaving town January 7.  Called in order Dec26 and was repeatedly assured I'd receive it in a week.  On dec28 received UPS email it would arrive jan7.  I called BAM and was told the holidays slowed everything down.  Why didn't my dec26 contact know that?  Had to pay for expedited shipping to receive in time.
Contact list had to be hand-written on their form and mailed in, instead of completed online.  (Yes, my handwriting is legible.)  Phoned in a single contact to customer support while form on the way.  BAM did allow me to scan and email the form to them.
Directions for testing the unit said to go to far parts of home and press the pendant help button but to hit the reset on the base within 5 seconds.  (Impossible for me to traverse that distance in 5s!!)  Customer service said i could do the "range test" instead but no directions for that came with the device.<//review>

After Dad died she was not ready to move from her home and was living alone. She tripped over the wheel on her walker and fell on the bathroom floor and fractured her pelvic bone. I received an alert from Bay Alarm and by the time I alerted a neighbor and she got there the paramedics were already helping Mom to an ambulance. Without the alarm system she could have died there before any body found her. Well worth the cost!</review><rating>5< /rating><userid>100845669552560614250<//userid></record>

<Review>I was a little hesitant about going with a company other than the heavily-advertised one that most people seem to know about, but the cost savings were significant and everything I saw looked like it was a good choice for my mother.  More than anything else, she wanted to know that the first alert would go to friends, not to 911, and this promised that.
It proved to be an excellent choice.  95% of the times her alert button got pressed (maybe three times a year over the four years we had the system) it was by mistake, but in each situation the reassuring voice confirmed the mistake and made sure she was well.  Once she apparently pressed it by mistake as she left the house, but a neighbor was able to go check and confirm that she was not hurt.  And then, one day she fell getting into bed and couldn't get up.  She pressed the button and within minutes the friend next door was there helping her get back into bed.  No drama--just the help she needed when she needed it.  Exactly what we were paying for.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<user>100561738127504441857< /user><text>I promptly receive my medial alert pendent and GPS locator.  I don't have a land line so I got the cellular option.   I was easy to hook up but when I went to test it I received an error message from the phone company.  I called customer service, the walked me through what I needed to do and had me test both the pendent and the GPS which worked beautifully.  They knew who I was and my location.  I live alone on a farm and have been concerned about having an animal (sheep, pig, or donkey) knock me down and not be able to call for help.  Hopefully I will never need it.  It was a little priced for my budget, but cheaper than direct tv.</text>< Date>

I've had Bay Alarm Medical for about a month now. I am 57 with cerebral palsy and subject to falls and I live with my 90-year-old mother. We've had to call the Fire Department several times because when I fall out of my wheelchair I cannot get up. The Fire Department suggested getting a medical alert button because one night I was on the floor for five hours before my cries were heard. After much research I chose Bay Alarm. We chose a wrist bracelet instead of the necklace to wear. My mother has been perfectly comfortable with her wrist alarm. I, however, since I use my arms so much with my wheelchair found that I was accidentally setting off the alarm repeatedly. They were very kind about it each time. Their first concern that we each were okay. They never got annoyed at a false alarm. But I switched to a necklace, because I was annoyed by triggering the false alarms. I had to pay extra to switch to the necklace, since the free trial period is only 14 days. But it took the full month to realize that no matter how I wore the bracelet---on which arm, facing up or down--I was still going to trigger the alarm. Other than my triggering the alarm by accident, we have had no problems. And the false alarms have proven to us that they will be there if we ever do have an emergency.   The price is reasonable. We did not opt for any of extra services.</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><pictures>None< /pictures><text>Disappointed with the Bay Alarm.   I paid for a year's worth of service and when my father passed away I returned the unit as required.   At the time I canceled the service, I was told we would receive a check in six week for the unused balance.

Today I find out this is not true, Bay Alarm does not refund the unused portion of any the balance already paid.

So if you do a one year prepay for the service in January and your loved one dies the next month and the service is no longer need, this company will not refund the remaining months - - they keep the balance.

Beware of these people. When you talk to them they contradict themselves.</text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Terrible experience using the equipment for the first time.   He pushed the button for assistance, the call appeared to be answered and he pressed nine to confirm. This happened twice. Still no EMS arrival after 11 minutes so my father called me and  I called the dispatch center who had no record of his request for assistance at all. The dispatch center in off hours was completely not helpful,  and were unable to troubleshoot the problem. They told me to leave a voicemail for tech-support for the next day. Also, it turns out the Bay Medical protocol does not require the dispatcher to stay on the line with the patient until EMS arrives. The patient must request it. I find that appalling.  It took more than 30 minutes to get him the medical care he needed which is completely unacceptable. Thank goodness he wasn't having a stroke or heart attack.   I'm glad I found out about this poor service on an occasion when it was not a life-threatening emergency. Thank goodness for that.  I will be getting a different monitoring  system for him tomorrow morning.

Now that I have read many more reviews, I am very disheartened that I could have such a terrible interaction and so many others couldn't wait to thank Carlos or Tricia for their customer service.  I'm sorry but way too many reviews appear to be fake.  I wish I had read further to read REAL reviews.  Those are actually meaningful and bad.  No company has such transparently fake reviews as Bay Medical.  The "Owner" comments always show concern about a low star rating.  At best you are offered a rep who will contact you in 24-48 hrs.  I never read an owner comment that acknowledged a problem or promised resolution. Just that someone would call.

What a fool I wax not to see through the bulls**t  reviews.  My bad.

DONT USE THIS COMPANY.  YOU WILL BE SORRY....<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I started service for a relative. Support agents were kind and friendly. The only part I didn’t like was finding out that the advertised “free shipping “ only applied to 6-month payment plans, although that isn’t stated on the website.<//Review>

They really want to separate themselves from Bay Alarm, but they're more of the same. Just rude customer service constantly trying to overcharge a customer. Stay away!</Text>< pics>

< review>
I am newly enrolled in the Bay Alarm medical alarm system. I have  had a recent occasion to make use of the emergency services offered. I had a bad fall in my condominium apartment in Lee, MA.  I could not get up and was in bad  pain. Fortunately I was wearing the alarm necklace  and pressed the button.  I received a call to confirm my need for help. The response was really quick with police and an ambulance with paramedicals who took me to the local hospital emergency service. I am most appreciative of the Bay Alarm service and their prompt and effective response.< /review>

<text>I received a cryptic phone call saying that my device had a security concern and left a Utah # to call. They did not ID themselves as Bayless and nor did they tell me who to contact once I called the number. I also had to go thru 2 depts and no one knew the details of the problem or the reason why they called me.

This is BS and BAD COMMUNICATIONS!

They should be clear and specific.< /text><Date>1540844454120</Date><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

Very easy to install.
When I've had questions, they have been promptly and courteously answered.
I have recommended Bay Alarm to many.
Having the "necklace" on gives me a lot of confidence.  I rarely take it off.
Thanks for having such a good product.

We are very glad to hear how pleased and comfortable you and your mom feel with our services.\n\nIn regards to your concerns:\nIf your mom was to push the button by accident and trigger a false alarm, the standard procedure would occur. The alarm would go off and a dispatcher would come over the base station and check to see if she is okay. She can kindly let them know she is okay and it was a false alarm. We highly suggest that she test the button at least once a month to be familiar with what occurs during an emergency. She can let our dispatcher know she is just testing. Feel free to call us if she needs assistance.\n\nWe are a bit unclear what your second concern is but would love for you to email us at support@bayalarmmedical.com so we can help address any worries.\n\nCathy, we really appreciate your kind words and honest feedback! We hope to address your concerns and provide any resolutions if necessary. It means a lot to hear from you. Thank you.'}<//Resp>

Bay Alarm Medical does not miss a thing in re: to their service on behalf of my 93 year old mother.  The ONLY  reason I did not give 5 Stars is because there needs to be a better explanation for family members of their Bay Alarm Medical client of what can happen under various circumstances.

Such as:
1.  The client presses their button and is not aware that they did so.
2.  The client has a new Base Station (for whatever the reason) and the BAM has not updated the change until BAM hasn't received a "ping" from the original station.  This triggers an alert via email, thus, a family member needs to call to inquire, straighten things out.

Again,  I am VERY satisfied with Bay Alarm Medical.  I live in a different state than my mother.  She has felt much better with this service while we work out details to get her closer to us.<//text>

The call center keeps forgetting to disconnect the call after verifying that nothing is wrong by cell phone.   This is very upsetting and almost caused an unnecessary EMS call today.  If it happens again,  we are going to switch to another alarm provider.</Text>

Bay Alarm Medical will not reimburse our money. Our family paid for their service yearly.  The last payment of around $260 was in December of last year.  We canceled the service last January because our mother went into an assisted living apartment.  Bay Alarm Medical's policy is not to reimburse unused services.  We lost $200.< /Review>

<Review>When I got my Bay Alarm I had goose bumps and looked forward to the security it provided.  It has been just a short time that I have had it.

It has gone off twice without a need.  There is a scramble to heard while I wait for some response.  Not good.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I set up an account for my Mother. Being stubborn she refused to leave her home which happen to be out in the middle of nowhere.  On three separate occasions Bay medical alert was used by my mother to summons an ambulance. Each time I was notified immediately to the emergency.  Their quick responce literally saved my Mother's life. Now we have her moved into town and have someone with her around the clock. Thank you Bay Medical. You were there for us when we needed you.

<Text>Bay Alarm you came through with doing the right thing again, I thank you so much and am so sorry for having to result to a negative post.  My faith is restored in your company, thank you so much.   You are now five stars with me.  thanks again.!

My original Post:   DO NOT use this company, besides the issues which I have dealt with them, concerning shipping charges, they now are telling my mother to pay $200.00, for something they caused me to break.  A new machine was sent to me and when I unplugged the old unit, I could not get it to stop saying, it was unplugged etc.., so the person on the phone said to take a sharp object and poke the white button.  I said but I will be charged if I break it. She said no, she will make note that she told me to poke that area with a sharp object.  Well you guessed it they now want $200.00 from me for breaking the white button.<//Text>< pics>

Bay Alarm has thought of most everything to make this a stress free start-up. The monitors do a good job (better to error on the cautious side) with occasional false alarms triggered by the fall protection model which is a very difficult engineering task.< /Text>

<Review>Thank you, Bay Alarm for your service. Fortunately during the time we were using it,  no emergency occurred. My mom did not feel that wearing the bracelet was doing anything until the day we experienced a power outage. In a very short time later Bay Alarm telephoned to check on the situation to determine why a signal was not being detected and if my mom needed anything. That phone call convinced her that someone was paying attention and would be available if she ever needed help when home alone.
Mom has moved to an assisted living and no longer requires your services, but I certainly recommend your system and will contact you again if ever we face a similar situation with any family member. Thank you!</Review>< Date>

We are on our 4th Necklace for my mom trying to get the fall detection to work.   Sadly if this doesn't work we have to get ANOTHER necklace that doesn't do fall detection.   If you really want fall detection DO NOT USE THIS company.< /review>

< review>
I hooked up the unit and was unable to plug the unit into the phone. I hit the "HELP" button  by accident and before I could connect the phone to the unit (they sent the wrong cord), a police officer was knocking on the door with full resuscitation gear to see if my mom was alright. Police where there in UNDER FOUR MINUTES. I apologized for the mistake and the officer was very gracious about the whole thing. BOTTOM LINE - this system works and works VERY WELL!!!! FIVE STARS! Hope my Mom never needs it but nice to know that if she does,  help is on the way!< /review>

Every time I talked with someone, they told me more of what I needed to know. Someone should tell you everything at one time. And I am not impressed by their response time. I don't like having to hold the button until it vibrates, and it can take up to a minute for someone to answer.</text>

Easy to establish account. Difficult to close it. I paid for the service in full for a year, despite never using it.That was fair enough because it was in the contract. What wasn't fair was this: they didn't cancel my subscription after a year as they'd promised they would. I only discovered this because they sought compensation from the senior I bought the service for and harassed her. They also tried to get an extra $200 on a trumped up equipment fee. They accused her of non-payment. I will probably pay instead of fight just to get them off this 92 year old woman's back. She's totally stressed about the bill and skeptical of me. Bear in mind that she did not sign up for the account or use the service. Bay Alarm had no business contacting her. My friend no longer trusts me to be her power of attorney because she believes I'm playing around with her finances as a result of receiving a bill she never should have gotten. I too have contacted the BBB.<//review>

< Review>
*ATTENTION*
CHECK SUBMITTED COMPLAINTS ON THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU BEFORE DECIDING TO DO BUSINESS WITH Bay Alarm Medical. They may have a good overall rating but they PREY ON MEEK CONSUMERS!

I had a medical monitoring contract through B.A.M. for two years and have no complaints about the  actual monitoring service.

The problem was encountered in their handling of the returned monitoring station unit.

They kept the UPS-packed, properly returned, non-tampered with unit for about three months then sent me a invoice for $150 stating that the unit was tampered with.

I never tampered with the unit and FILED A COMPLAINT with the Better Business Bureau and the charge was rightfully reversed.

*DO NOT ENGAGE IN BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY*

The monitoring service is adequate BUT, similar to what they did to me, THEY MAY TRY TO FIND A WAY TO GET MORE MONEY FROM YOU TOO< /Review>

I found Bay Alarm's customer representative to be very friendly and helpful when I called to cancel my mother's service.  Bay Alarm has also been very responsive the few times we needed them.
Thank you!< /Text>

< Review>
My mother's power went out and I received a phone from Bay Alarm saying that their connection to her had been lost. Since I live in a different state I ended up calling the police and they informed me of the power outage, but since she is in her 90s, they would go by and check on her.  She was fine, but very frightened, and doesn't see well (so the dark made it worse). They got her set up with flashlights so she was more at ease. She was so thankful for Bay Alarm for contacting me. Thank you.</Review>

While the response to any alerts or equipment tests have worked quite well, we are on our 4th pendent in 5 months.  Each pendent has simply stopped working without any warning.  We discover the failure when doing a test.<//Review>

<Review>My mother was 88 years old and had just broken her hip when she was visiting my sister. She lives alone and wants to keep her current living arraignments.  It was very obvious she needed a medical alarm system.  After reviewing several companies and different reviews, I selected Bay Alarm Medical. She now is approaching her 91st birthday and still lives alone in her home of over 68 years. Thankfully, she had not needed to activate the alert for a medical emergency; however, she as accidently pushed the alarm button a several occasions.  She loves the Bay Alarm, she says the operators call her immediately, are very courteous, and really appears concerned about her welfare.  Living over 400 miles away, this means more to me that you can imagine.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Bay Alarm Medical has been a wonderful service for my mom. She has pushed her button and had paramedics respond more quickly than if she had called me first. This last time my mom fell and broke her shoulder. Remsa (the local ambulance/EMTs) responded to my mom's apartment and transported her to the hospital before I could even get there.  Purchasing this service is the best thing I could have done for my mom.< /review>< pictures>

<text>The service it's self has been really good.  So I feel bad rating it low, but I am unhappy with the customer service and feel it is important for other out of town family members to understand that even if your loved one is taken into hospital or hospice care long term, you have to return all the equipment immediately to be able to cancel the account.  At least let me suspend the service so I have time to drive the 500 miles to ship back the equipment.  I was disappointed at the complete lack of feeling on the other end of the line.  That said, Bay Alarm was helpful when my grandpa did fall and need help.  Customer service is what left a bad taste in my mouth and would make me consider a different service for my other grandparents in the future.  Bay Alarm is not the only game in town.  I recommend they improve their customer service for the existing clients to keep them coming back and recommending them to others.<//text></record></dataset><record>

The young man who I spoke with on the phone, seriously needs some sort of listening skills training.  He continued to "talk over" what I was trying to say and when he was on the phone with my 81 year old mother, he did the same thing. She ended up getting so flustered with him, she had to hang up.
Sincerely,

Marti Schneider< /Text>

I was told I would have to pay $150 for the equipment since I did not have the equipment which  I was never told when it was purchased. I called to receive a refund on the subscription of $240 that was automatically billed to my account, then was told to pay the 150 and they can refund it. After I paid the $150 I was told to send in a death certificate and we can "talk" about the refund on the subscription.    Horrible service. Bay Alarm, if you want me to remove or edit this review you will refund me in whole, the $150 and $240 subscription fee.<//text><gmapID>0x80856693b1eabe9d:0x64381fc120e1c2ef< /gmapID><user_name>JD S<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

<Review>I received a telephone call to inform me of a low battery.  I called and the staff member checked my account and saw immediately the problem.  She told me which unit was failing and took steps to send me a replacement.  You cannot expect better service.  Thanks to the staff of Bay Alarm Medical.

< Review>
My wife  misplaced her necklance with the button to activate our alert system, so I called customer service to purchase another one.  I talked to
Rebecca on July 19th, 2017, and placed the order.  She was very helpful.
BUT, after I hung up the phone, I checked one more place, and found the old one.  I then immediately called again and talked to Maria.  I requested that the order be cancelled, and Maria took action to cancel it.  Very helpful ladies.  Thank you.< /Review>

<Text>Be careful when discontinuing service with these folks because they will continue to charge you until they receive their equipment back. I used this company when I was going to be gone for an extended period of time. Luckily, it wasn't until I returned home my 91 year young aunt needed the service. Since she had a home care provider I did not see an further need for the unit. So being the one paying the bill on this account I sent them a letter cancelling service. Needless to say I received a 10 day notice letter from them. Of course, I called them and indicated I had sent a letter to which they indicated they did not receive a cancellation notice and that they would need the equipment back before they could cancel the service. Read your cancellation portion of your contract carefully because they will continue to charge you fees and it's best to contact this company by phone and in person and get the name of the person you are talking to so you can avoid a lot of headache as well as having this company take more money from you.< /Text><name>Ron Sakamoto<//name></record></dataset><record>

This is one company that you do not want service from.  I am dealing with the accounts collection department right now and getting past Kevin Smith to speak with someone about how they treated my business partner and myself is equivalent to calling the white house and asking to speak to President Obama.  Their contracts are written to screw its end user (business) out of thousands of dollars even if their company picks the equipment up.  I will never recommend this company but if you choose services from them remember several things.

1.  Purchase the equipment and go on a month-to-month agreement.
2.  If the sales person is very pushy escort him/her out.
3.  Do not lease there surveillance equipment.  You can find dozens of companies that will install the same equipment for much less.
4.  Call other alarm companies and mention bay alarm lease agreements and you will hear hundreds of rip-off stories.
5.  Do Not Lease because that's how they stick you with the BS in their contract.  There is nothing special about their equipment.  Do not let the salesperson fool you.

Beware Bay Was Not Good For My Businesses.<//Text>

In early April I became very ill and  asked Bay Alarm to send an ambulance to take me to the hospital..  Instead of calling the ambulance I requested, they called my daughter who lives 50 miles away.   While waiting for the ambulance I by accident I set off my home alarm, and those people seeing that I was distressed called the ambulance for me. This was not an acceptable response, and I am researching my options  for another service.</Review><user>117124039901822237681</user><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

I just got off the phone with a customer service representative who I think her name was Laura who   answered my question quickly and precisely. And I must say that my call was picked up in less than a minute.
And just to be clear I did not call on the emergency line, it was customer service.< /review>

They had me to a bunch of stuff to try to troubleshoot, which didn't work. The unit is not functioning and they want to charge me $200 to replace it. This is very distressing to me especially since I have recommended them to many people and was about to help another friend set up an account. If this is how they treat older vulnerable individuals, I don't want to have anything to do with them. Also, I prepaid for a year and they will not refund the unused portion< /review></record></dataset><record>

The alarm system is not working correctly or my system is not picking up things it should. It has gone off 9 times in the 18 months I have had it!  Every time I get within 2 feet from the system, it goes off! I have to explain to the person who calls that everything is ok, something is not working correctly in the system! Otherwise I have 3 friends who have no problems.<//Text>

It does look like because it was a billing-related question in regards to a credit card on file, for security reasons, we handle these situations over the phone. We understand chat may be easiest and most convenient, but our priority is to ensure our customers are safe, which includes their personal information. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us via chat or by phone should you have further questions. We would be happy to help! Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical'}< /response>

Your representative "Jessica" was very professional and a pleasure to talk to. I'm not the easiest person to talk to and sometimes can come across as a curmudgeon. We spent about 15 mins. discussing your system after which I placed my order. She did a real great job and it was delightful speaking to her.  She is an asset to your company.

<review>Notice that the young man, Alan, the only really positive Google + Review listed, is a 4-year employee of Bay Alarm Medical, and read his review of his grandfather's experience with a touch of skepticism! (Just click on his picture or go into the company website and click on "Meet the Team"). Sad when the only person with good things to say about the company is an employee!<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I have found there billing practices deceptive and difficult to sort out.  They have many complaints with the BBB.  I complained after they billed my credit card and also took a check for the same services.  Now they have added $60 a year fee because I pay by check rather than have continuing access to my credit.  Be very careful with this organization.<//review>< Pictures>

<user>103130083449859710030</user><name>Pj H.< /name><Time>1466725734354< /Time><rating>4<//rating><text>We chose Bay Alarm based on good reviews online and opted for the landline version because I was afraid the cell version would be left on the charger in a moment of need.  However you have to be within yelling distance of the unit to talk to the operator, so they cannot hear you if you are are another floor, or in the bathroom with the door closed.  (Bay Alarm is  supposed to call 911 if they do not get a response.)  Fortunately we have not had a need to use it in an emergency yet.  I watched videos on the Bay Alarm site showing people talking into the pendant, but I guess that is the cell/mobile version, not the landline version that we got.   My mom fell and fractured her pelvis, and after that she actually *wanted* an alert, so we didn't have to fight about it.   She wanted as small a pendant as possible, so we didn't get the fall alert.  She wears it under her clothes and seems okay with it.  The first time we called to test it, it didn't seem to work.  The second time they answered after a few rings.  They say you need to pay $200 if there is damage to the unit, or you can buy their damage insurance.  So you may want to get a surge protector for the phone and electricity for the unit (if you can still find one that takes phone lines) and forego the insurance, or not.  Hope this helps you decide!<//text>< Pics>

Having trouble getting button s to work.  On third unit. Order should have been completed by 1st week June, still can not operate unit. Company ground ships New units, rather than air ship replacement units. Takes a week each time. Not acceptable service<//Text>

We are very glad to hear how excited you are to have this device in your car to ensure you are never left alone in an emergency. While we hope you never have to use it, we thank you for trusting in our team to be there for you in the case that you do. In terms of setting up, you only need to log in and input all the car info and then plug the device into the car port. We see you had some password troubles and hope that our representative was able to assist with that. Please give us a call back if you are still having trouble logging in. Also, our devices have been tested in different cars (old and new models) and all 12v ports are compatible. We can't say what your car port is like but give our tech support team a call and we can walk you through a test to ensure it works! We are happy to help you any time!"}</response>< gmap_id>

Tried to test the alarm button and told the operator it was just a test.  My 1st, 2nd and 3rd contact people were all called and told that I had an emergency and an ambulance was on it's way to my house.  My son called me and found out from me it was just a test and call Bay Alarm to cancel the ambulance.  It was a very frustrating afternoon!<//Text>

<Date>1529212781186< /Date><review>When I first looked into getting a medical pendant for my Mother who suffers from congestive heart failure, I read many reviews on the different companies out there.   Bay Medical came up not as the top recommended company, but somewhere in the middle.  I think what attracted me the most about their product was that the price was a little cheaper than other companies.

Well, you get what you pay for!

My initial interaction with this company was through their website.  I ordered their equipment, it arrived in a little over a week's time.  Missing from the box was what should have been an extra phone cord so you could piggy-back the dialing/speaker unit to your phone.  Instead, the company provided a computer cable which was worthless for me -- and I suspect -- most other people's purposes.

After a few days, I decided I did not want to be charged monthly.  It would be easier to be charged quarterly.  I sent the company an email, they told me to call them on a specific day to change my billing so that I would not end up getting pro-rated.

On the specified day, I made my first phone call to the company and found out something rather alarming....

They don't answer the phone.

During regular business hours, no matter whether you need technical support, have a billing question, or you want to make an inquiry on becoming a customer --- THERE IS NO LIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.

Each and every time I called their customer hotline, I reached a recording telling me to leave a message.

l would leave a message and end up having to play phone tag with the customer service agents.  They call you back on their available time.  I spent days trying to chase down an agent over the phone until I finally gave up and told them to cancel my account and arrange to return my equipment.

At that point, they stopped emailing me back.  They would not confirm my cancellation request.  They became absolutely silent.

I ended up having to contact my credit card company and have the charge removed and a block put on all future charges made to me by Bay Medical Alarm.

Then I went to the BBB website and started reading one horror story after another about how uncaring this company is when tragedies do happen.  I suggest anyone thinking of dealing with this company do a check on BBB ratings.  Simply Google: "Bay Medical Alarm Complaints" or "Bay Medical Alarm Better Business Bureau".

I am now in the process of returning their equipment, at my own expense..  They won't pay for the return.

Do yourself a huge favor and spend a little more money with a more reputable company.  Any company that runs a Medical Emergency Business by forcing you to communicate through voice messaging instead of a live agent does not deserve your consideration.

UPDATE:  Went with LifeFone.  A little more expensive but they offer live customer support and their equipment is far, far better than what Bay Alarm Medical offered.< /review>< Pictures>

defective equipment for very elderly (90 and 93), your solution started with asking them to plug into their modem. Are you kidding? They are infirm, thats why they have your equipment to start with!<//review>

After reviewing the websites of other alarm systems, I decided to obtain more information from Bay Alarm before making a final decision.  I called and talked to a rep named Eduardo Perez who thoroughly explained all the pros and cons of their system that would best suit me.  I delayed making a decision until Mr. Perez followed up with his letter reminding me of our previous conversation.  I then asked more detailed questions about their product which he answered without hesitation.  I am now awaiting the arrival of the system he thought would best fit my needs.  I feel confident that should I not understand something with installing it in my home, I will get all the help required from Mr. Perez and his company.
I also feel that I made the right choice for the right cost.

We truly appreciate your loyalty to the Bay Alarm Medical family over the years. We are sorry to hear you experienced some issues, but it does look like you were able to call in each time to get clarification and help. We are by no means perfect, but we definitely try to help our customers through - especially if we've made an error. In regards to cancelling over the phone, we do not cancel accounts over the phone - this goes for all customers. The equipment is leased and needs to be returned in working condition in order for us to cancel out the account. We do see the call was disconnected from our representative as they tried to assist you, so please give us a call back and we can assist you with power down instructions and what to expect with the cancellation process so we can ease your mind. There are no cancellation fees as we like to make this process simple for customers. Again, give us a call and we would be happy to help! Thank you."}</resp>< review>
I had been a Bay Alarm customer for about 5 yrs.  During that time we had a few problems and had a bad experience when I tried to cancel our account over the phone.</review>

Shyra was patient and thoroughly explained everything.  She ended up saving me money, since I originally thought we wouldn't be able to use their landline service with VOIP phones.  She asked who provided our internet service and reassured me that we could get the service for landlines.  Also, when I found out how the fall alert program worked, we determined that just the button I wore would work the best.  We also discussed wall button options, in case we wanted them in the future.  After having all my questions answered so thoroughly and pleasantly, I signed up and prepaid for 6 months, saving me additional funds.  A win-win situation.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>The unit is for my Mom who has MS and has been unable to walk since 2001.  The unit was returned early beacause of a recent turn for the worse in my mom's condition after I paid for my second 6 months in full.  Upon calling for the pro-rated amount to be refunded to my credit card for the unused time on my account, I was curtly and robotically scriptedly told that Bay Alarm Medical does not give the customer their monies due.  I AM DISPUTING WITH MY CREDIT CARD<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1485370940476, 'text': "Hi Rt - We are so sorry to hear about your mother's current condition and we would love to assist you. We looked into the account and confirmed that the unit was returned and the service has been canceled. We will proceed in getting a pro-rated refund issued to you in order to enhance your relationship with our company. Your review means a lot to Bay Alarm Medical and we hope that your updated review will reflect your resolution experience with us. Please give us a call if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical"}< /response>< gmap_id>

We did want to let you know that we do not send out receipts or statements unless a customer requests one. As of right now, we only send billing reminders before the next billing date. If you are interested in a receipt/statement you can request one by phone or email. If you can confirm the name on the account we would be happy to send one to you or feel free to give our billing department a call. Talk to you soon, Bay Alarm Medical'}</response>< Rate>

< Review>
tI wouldn't trust  any service company because had a very seriorius almost a fall but worse I had a shot of a thing I had three time before a shot that cushions the knee without going though another total knee replacement. The problem appeared after3 hour I couldn't stand up, I had a pendant as I call Bay Alarm Medical and they did more then I could have asked for. I walked to the Door, even though I had padlock I didn't want to take any chances. I also called 911 but there was tie. Anyway I got transported to the ER
being taken out of my hose with a something that look like a dolly. Any way I was taken the the ER by the ;Spring Lake Rescue Squad  And the Lake Como Police who had a had to pull me up to go to the bathroom and put me on the dolley. I was released form the JSMC ER after 5 hours with an Xray and gave me two pain pill and I went home with a taxi. All the nurses and doctors and the receptionist and X-ray tech were very professional and even get the disk of my Xray/<//Review>

This service performs as advertised.  The only thing wrong with it is that it does not offer GPS service, so it is mainly for use in and close to (within a few hundred feet) of the home.< /Text>

The alarm pendant was accidentally activated. We talked with the alarm company and they turned it off. But for the rest of the night it said calling and would not shut off then there is no technical department to help in the off-hours. I disconnected the whole thing and it still continues to say calling alarm. Very very frustrated.<//text>

Very disappointed how I was treated by customer service and held hostage to close account due to loss of equipment,.  They initially wanted almost $300.00 for equipment before they would cancel account.   Beware, If you loss equipment it will cost you and they don't care about your personal situation.<//text>

{'time': 1552495027171, 'text': 'Hi Mary Kaye - We are so sorry about the inconvenience this has caused you. We are glad to see a representative was able to assist you promptly and has already ordered an In-home Cellular system to be sent out to you. You are more than welcome to void this review until you actually have feedback. As a note, the type of cell phone you have does not matter in relation to our products or services. In-home Cellular system runs off of local AT&T network towers, meaning you do not have to have AT&T at all, its simply network we use for our In-home Cellular system. Again, the new system is being sent out to you and we will have a representative follow up to make sure everything works out for you. Thank you, Bay Alarm Medical'}< /Response>

My mother's equipment malfunctioned with in months of getting it. They were going to charge an outrageous amount of money to fix or exchange machine. When my elderly mother, on a fixed income, said she was just going to return it they told her that since it stopped working in her care, they would charge $200 for her to return the equipment.  ridiculous treatment of an elderly woman!!<//text>

Which is ironic due to the fact that this is a life alert company. She shows no sympathy to death and honestly should be let go for belittling someone who is grieving over death.</review>< Pictures>

Customer feedback matters to us, whether its at the time of purchase or if a customer has been with us for years. We apologize that requesting feedback was seen as negative, leading you to give us a 3-star review. We understand you won't have feedback on the actual service yet, so feel free to provide a full review once you are ready. We always appreciate what our customers have to say.

I received my system Friday, March 1, 2019, late in the afternoon.  After opening the box and holding the mobile health device I would need to carry around my neck on a lanyard to detect falls, I decided to return the contents of the entire box without even unpacking the box.  I dislike carrying things around my neck and the weight of the mobile health device alone was enough to convince me I did not need this particular device hanging around my neck whenever I left the house.  Thanks.<//review>

My mom was having trouble with her unit, and it was calling for help when she wasn't even home.  She called the tech support team and they helped her reboot her system.  Thank you.< /Review>

<text>frustrating experience with Bay Alarm today which resulted in EMS knocking on my door<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1550165325280, 'text': 'Hi Richard - Thank you for taking the time to review us. We are so glad to hear you are okay and it was just a false alarm. We do see that a representative successfully tested the system with you over the phone and that another test was done later on. As a reminder, when the dispatch center comes over the main unit (the one with the big red HELP button), let them know you are only testing to avoid EMS being sent. We are sorry for your frustration and would love to make sure you are okay, so we have assigned a Tech Support representative to assist you. Talk to you soon!

< review>
Horrible! You can't get information without an email, and the phone number on the web site is a non working number. I was wanting to get information sent to my mother who doesn't own a computer and gave her the number which doesn't work, couldn't get information sent to her without an email address. REMEMBER this is supposed to be support for seniors...... what support do they get later????????</review>

Horrible product. Did not work and after my 87 year old mother sent it back was told she should have got a tracking number and was charged $200. The customer service through this was rude, dismissive and horrible. DO NOT LET THEM TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR LOVED ONES

So far we have had 2 false alarms that ambulance was called.     But problem seemed to be because the contact number for  Bay Med to call us was wrong. Called customer service and changed contact number.< /review>

Bay Alarm Medical will keep charging you even after you cancel services since they do not accept verbal cancellations.  They only way they will cancel services if you mail the equipment back otherwise they will keep charging your account unless you change your bank account which is what I had to do.  They will not issue credit for unused services.  So if the user passes away they expect you to use your money to ship back their product but they will not issue credit for the unused portion of service even after they receive their equipment back.</Text>

Having Bay Alarm Medical allowed my father to remain in his own home longer than he would have without it at 94 years old. It literally saved his life 3 times. I would not hesitate to recommend their services.< /text>
