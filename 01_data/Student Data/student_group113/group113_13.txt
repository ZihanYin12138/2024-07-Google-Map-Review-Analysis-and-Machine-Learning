This is a nice mom and pop music store. Not a whole lot of high end gear, but a decent selection of affordable and midrange instruments with good customer service. Staff seemed fairly knowledgeable and were friendly.< /text>

Napa Music Supply is the best music shop around. Been going there for years and have purchased all my guitars from them. I had them order in my tele and a bass a while back no problem. If it’s not on the floor then there is a great chance they can order it in for you. Always going the extra mile for the customer!</review>

i love this place and used to go often before covid, i used to go just to play the ukuleles and look at guitars with my girlfriend :) I just have a question since I can't find it anywhere, how much does it cost to get all the strings on my guitar restrung? I just got it as a hand-me-down so the strings were bound to break and now they have. So yeah, love this place so much <3</review>

{'time': 1601945085284, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words and shopping with us! Our locals shopping with us is helping us keep the doors open. ❤️\nWe charge $10 for the service plus the cost of the strings. Usually the total is just under $20. We try very hard to get it back to you the same day you drop it off. When we change your strings we will condition your fretboard, give your guitar a good looking over to see if there are any issues that may be a problem later then clean it, apply a little lubricant on the tuners if needed, restring it and tune it.\nThank you again. 😁'}< /Response>

Josh was so laid back and friendly and knowledgeable and let me look around and plug in some really nice guitars while he was assisting others.
I walked out the proud owner of a beautiful Telecaster.  (It’s true I’ve wanted one for years and they happened to have, in stock, the perfect color/model, so there IS that, but I hadn’t been budgeting for such an awesome axe.)
Thanks Josh and everyone at Napa Music!!!!!!!< /text>< Pics>

Love this place. All the STUFF you need. Strings, cords, picks, capos, Mic cables, straps, instrument stands,  etc. Nice selection of ukulele's. Very good selection of Taylor acoustics. Keyboards, Electric guiters, and small venue amps. Very nice music store. Very friendly and helpful staff. Musicians living in, or visiting Napa, can find what they need.</text>

Came here for a quick buy, needed a mic boom. Called in ahead of time and they set it aside for me, they have excellent customer service.  They do however cater more to guitar player than anything else. But a killer music store! 👍< /review>

The people are so kind and the place has enough guitars and other supplies to have a good choice, and it is not overwhelming like some places can be. 10/10 would recommend. Plus, if they don’t have the exact guitar, they’ll order it. I wanted a certain fender guitar but they didn’t have the exact color that I wanted so they ordered it. Awesome and super helpful.< /Review>< pics>

tested it at the shop and all seemed fine. Later I started noticing my tone knob had a bad connection and was cutting in and out. I took it apart and to my surprise... I found a $55 master piece!!! They took apart only 1 solder that was going from 1 wire to 4 wires... It still looks like garbage, still has bad connections and excessive solder... At to top it off... My 9v bracket is a piece of tissue wrapped around the battery and held on with a rubber band!<//text>

<Review>So friendly and helpful! Diane was more than happy to help with any questions and even restrung our ukelele for a left-handed person. It's a service they offer but one well chosen. They offer mostly guitars and related accessories but also a small sepection of keyboards and percussion. They also have reeds and brass/woodwind accessories and can help with ordering those instruments, although they don't sell any in store. Regardless they o7ld be able to make that happen with the appropriate knowledge so you can't really go wrong!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Great local store with friendly customer service and a surprisingly interesting selection for a small shop. If they don't have it they seem willing to work hard to get it for you.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This place has all kinds of professional instruments of all kinds such as electric and acoustic guitars ... everything. The only bad thing is that when you go looking for a tool for your guitar they don't have it and they don't give you a quick solution. So you have to find another place. That's maddening

Este lugar tiene toda variedad de intrumentos profesionales de todo tipo como guitarras eléctricas, acústicas....de todo.   Lo único malo es que cuando vas en busca de una herramienta para tu guitarra no lo tienen y no te dan una pronta solución.  Por lo cuál tienes que buscar otro lugar.   Éso es desesperante< /text>

Really nice place to camp at, directly at the lake, with beach access
Beware though! Even though it's by the lake, right now it's pretty much overrun by bears each night because of its close proximity to the beach (leftovers at the parking...) and people leaving food at the tables at night / sending invites to the bears with smelly barbeques
So basically If you're not always of bears, you're good to go!</text>

Verizon has pretty good 4G reception here. Att straight talk/ NET10 have spotty reception. ..sometimes 2 bars 4H, sometimes no signal. You have to move around even within your campsite. The beach has consistent 4G for all carriers mentioned above. I stayed at camp site 34 and my straight talk hotspot (moxie) always had good 4G signal in this camp site and at beach . Screenshots are of NET10 /att signal at beach, at campsite 34 and an IPhone with Verizon at site 34. Fat bear here will harass campers that don't clean up their campsites and are cooking things like burgers. Bring your vegetarian meals instead. Don't count on hosts to take care of bear problems. Thumbs up me if helpful. :)</text>

Well kept. Steps away from the beach, which can get a little crowded but manageable.  Our campsite 35 was smaller than most, but sufficient for our purposes, and was the site nearest the beach. Most of the sites are large, and this is definitely a family campground.  Bears may visit you, so follow the rules😊<//review>

<text>People arrived after 1:30 am???!!! Parents talking and laughing while setting up tents, and kids making weird sound... I don’t get it!
3 stars for the campsite itself, well maintained, food lockers for each site, flush toilet, pet allowed, plus great views.<//text>< pictures>

Sandy beach, no boat area, no dogs on the beach. Toilets and a water tap. $10 day pass. Campground reservation only.
Stars down coz they would not let me drive in just to fill up my water, like a hard no, despite there being a place to pzll up for those few mins.

Love this campground. Very clear cool water. We went on sep 13 2018. The view is breathtaking. The only downside is there is no hand soap provided nor showers and it gets super chilly at night. Other than that a very great place to camp with the family.</text>

This was our second year tent camping at Meeks Bay. We absolutely love this place. The staff is so wonderful and kind. The bathrooms are clean, campgrounds are clean, the general store has an AWESOME beer  selection, and the location is perfect.

Some other reviews mention being near the road, yes it is close to the road but it is not as close as some of the others near South lake. And the wall muffled the traffic noise. We stay at the first tent site against the road and it is not noticeable at all.

We are looking forward to next year! ☺️<//review>

Just wanted to give a shout out to Rick and Michelle the camp hosts, they were so helpful and made our stay wonderful! They even chased off the bear who tried to have dinner with us. We will be back for sure, an all-around great place to camp!< /Text>

Campground is super clean and has great hosts - especially Michelle and Ricky! They are fabulous! Most people will love this campground. PROS: you can walk to the beach at the lake; lots of trees; decent sized sites; close to great hiking (one great trail is nearly right across the road); barely to no signal on your cell (a plus IMO). CONS: right at road, you always hear the traffic, and campground is in the road bend, so no matter where you camp you cannot escape traffic noise; fairly busy even though I was there during the week, and people had their music blasting; you will most likely not have a signal on your cell should you need it. I personally will not go back to Lake Tahoe area for camping ever, I'm more of an Eastern Sierra kind of girl. But like I said, most campers will probably love Meeks Bay campground and enjoy their stay very much.< /Review>

Well located near South Lake Tahoe with access to Meeks Bay Beach. Wood sold didn't burn well at all and our spot had a fair amount of litter in it.<//review>

Beautiful Lake! And the camp ground is steps from the Lake. Will definitely be back next year. Side note you have to make reservations 6 months in advance. No joke.< /Review>

The beach is beautiful and a bit crowdy like all nice places in summer time. Campers and day use area people fill it up quickly. Camp is clean and nice but too close to a road. We sleept in a tent and could hear passing cars all the time. Bears are common guests on this camp! So never leave any food or smelly items outside of the bear box.</review>

The team at the Joint is amazing! From the front desk all the way to the back of the team of doctors. They listen to your concerns and get to the root of the problem. I was hesitant at first but after my first session to several I'm starting to feel like myself again. I have less headaches and pain now. I highly recommend this office and company. Thank you for helping with my pains!<//review>

Not too satisfied with this place. One day no doctor is in, the next day he turns me away to close early. Rude receptionist.

Edit: I feel scammed. Disregarding the lie below that I showed up "right at 5," I tried to cancel the service about 2 weeks in and was given the run-around. It's now coming up to the second month and I'm informed that there's a 2-month minimum, which is in the writing but not mentioned or discussed at sign-up. Everything about this business feels shady, and the service isn't worth it.< /review>

The doctor was out due to a family emergency and unfortunately a replacement could not cover the clinic that day. This is not typical.\n\nSecondly, the doctor said you came right when the clinic was already closed at 5pm yesterday on Sunday when he still had 2-3 patients to treat. Please remember that the clinic operates 10am-5pm on Saturdays and Sundays, and to plan accordingly.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Joint Chiropractic - Sunset Galleria'}</response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>The Joint Chiropractic at 7121 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood is a lifesaver.  I'm very active senior with an athletic background and to be able to drop in for an adjustment is just about as convenient as one would want.   All of the Chiropractors there are professional and very competent.  Dr. Drew is my favorite though.  As a former professional athlete, he knows the "athletic body" if you will.  Having been in the pro sports training rooms, Dr. Drews approach is one that I can relate to and am very pleased with.< /Review>< Pics>

When you came in, there was a new patient and a returning patient that had not been in for more than a year. Due to this, the wait time goes up to properly assess these patients before they can receive treatment.\n\nAll wait times are approximate, but often the wait time is much less than predicted. However, since we are a walk-in clinic, it is often difficult to predict how busy it will be, but the afternoon and evening does tend to be slightly busier than in the morning. Especially, as COVID-19 restrictions loosen, patients feel more comfortable coming back in. Currently, there is only one doctor on staff per day at our clinic, but as it steadily gets busier we will hopefully add another doctor on the busier days.\n\nOnce again, we understand your frustration, please be patient we are trying to get to everyone who walks in as quickly as possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Joint Chiropractic - Sunset Galleria'}< /response>< Rating>

The Joint Chiropractic is the best! My husband and I come every weekend to see Dr. Wong. He’s a caring, gifted, and thoughtful doctor. I always feel so much relief after going. (Thank you Dr. Wong). We’re grateful to be on the monthly subscription plan and be able to commit to regular chiropractic care. It’s been a catalyst to making healthier life choices as well as joint and body healing. (Thanks again Dr. Wong)!<//text>

By FAR the best chiropractor I've had the opportunity to get treatment by. I schedule my weekend around this guy. I get pretty stiff throughout the week and by the week's end I could use some help. Being a taller and bigger fella than some, my body doesn't always adjust easily, but this guy finds a way to adjust me in a gentle way, giving me some much needed relief! God bless you sir, for using your gift to help the community!< /text>

<review>The various locations supply various doctors.

Therefor, you’re lucky if you find one that is capable of connecting energetically and listening and then executing the adjustments according to your own needs.  Finding a Chiropracter that’s right for your is important and it’s hit and miss (with mostly misses) only docs that work for me are in West Hollywood and only works Sunday/Monday.  Sant Monica- which by the time I get down there from Hollywood and drive back I need an adjustment again 😫- also, a lot of rotation.
So yeah, if you’re  a long time, experienced person with Chiropractic-be aware your favorite doctor may or may bot be nearby or even still with the company after a few months.  My HUGE Recs are for Dr. Wong, Dr.C-woman, and Dr. B in WeHo. They are up-to-date on procedures and understand energy balancing and connectivity there in more than others I have dealt with and I’ve seen probably about six or seven different doctors at this company.< /review>< Pics>

I wish could give a higher rating than 5 stars!! I love the business model and the quick productive service. I went in there with a lower back injury and after the assessment there was a quick plan of action to fix my back. Within 2 weeks my back was fixed and fully adjusted. Every time I go into The Joint I leave feeling more relaxed and for some amazing reason a little taller. I wish I could explain that feeling. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and I am always excited to go in there for a quick adjustment and then go about my day. 5 stars and I still keep going in even though my back is fixed.< /text>

I really like the way they do plans so I can get into the chiropractor regularly at an affordable rate. I've always been treated well by the staff and doctors. I also use other offices when traveling and appreciate being able to access care in other states as well.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I absolutely LOVE The Joint! At first I was extremely skeptical about chiropractors (due to some previous experiences), but this place and the faculty is absolutely amazing. I came in unable to touch my toes (which I’ve always been able to do) and I couldn’t stand on one leg due to the excruciating pain that I would get. Within a couple weeks I was back to touching my toes and putting on pants like a normal person. They are truly gifted!!! I would highly recommend!!!!</review>< pictures>

I have been coming here for a while now and love the doctors. I have had some back and neck issues my whole life and many places I've gone have been hit or miss. This place keeps good notes so no matter who I see the care quality is the same. Today I came in because I did something to my back over the weekend that made it hard to walk without pain and I was fixed in a matter of seconds. I also appreciate that the monthly plan is super affordable and there is no pressure for up sales on anything. Love this place.

Update 9/27/19 still great! Consistantly awesome.<//Text>

The only issue is sometimes it gets busy and there is only one doctor is on site. I wish they could have more doctors on site during busy hours to help each other out with the flow.

The Joint has been a very helpful and great place for me to go whenever I need an adjustment. The staff is great and always warm when I go in. Also, the doctors are great and listen to any concerns I have and always help fix me up and help me feel refreshed and ready to go with my week.
With a very busy schedule, The Joints hours of operation are very convenient for me and i know it helps me to find the time to get adjusted each week.

Thanks to The Joint for always being the best!</review>

<review>This is the place to go, whether you are looking for conservative treatment of a condition, such as a pinched nerve, or simply to maintain proper alignment so that you feel your best.
Also, not only is this place perfect for anyone in a hurry who does not like to spend time in waiting rooms, but also the cost is unbeatable. There are a number of treatment packages to save you even more money and to fit your schedule. I recommend to anyone looking for a chiropractor.</review><rating>5< /rating><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Matt Laydon</Name>< UserId.>

<review>The primary chiropractor, Dr. Schott, who is here during the week is fantastic!  If I was only reviewing him, I would give 5 stars. Unfortunately, I’m only giving 3 stars for the sometimes lengthy wait times. This location is getting too big for what they can manage. New patients take a minimum of 20 minutes and they do not accept appointments, so it’s first come first serve. Frequently has wait times of 30 minutes or more.< /review>< Resp>

I went to this place to get an adjustment, the young chiropractor is not doing it as gentle as in other locations. My neck started to hurt after that, felt dizzy and I got a headache 4 days in a row, couldn't move my neck without pain, not coming back to this location again. Worst experience I've ever had with a chiropractor. Of course they try to up sell.
I called them asking what to do to get better. They said supervisor will call me back but nobody ever called.
I understand where most good reviews come from, sometimes they give free ice packs if you write a review or check in from Yelp.
UPDATE: don't be fooled by their response, they didn't reach out to me after that.</Text>

I walked in with a pinched nerve so bad I was nauseous. After my adjustment my condition improved little by little throughout the day. Four hours later I was hiking 10 dogs.

Now let's talk price... UNBEATABLE.  $30!!! I purchased a membership which will bring the cost of my visits down by nearly 1/2 for the first month with new member perks. Even at just the regular visit cost the pricing is unbelievable. Adding regular  Chiro to my care wasnt possible before I found the Joint. Even looking up locations to hit on my upcoming domestic travel.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Had a neck injury 20 years ago and an accident 10 years ago that came back to haunt me. Woke up with a super stiff neck one random morning. With a few treatments I was feeling much better. Not to mention the relief from all of the back tension as well. I would recommend everyone get adjusted at least once in your life regardless if you think you need it.

After a torturous month of back pain, I decided it was time to take it seriously. The Joint REALLY helped me with my pain. After a month, I am only feeling a light to medium discomfort at times. The doctor in this location genuinely cares about his clients. He is an excellent professional and I we built trust very shortly. I highly recommend this location. Even though it is in West Hollywood, it is not as busy as people would assume. On this Saturday at 12:30 I had to wait just five minutes to be able to see him.< /Review>

This place and its entire staff , from the front desk to all of the Drs are seriously the best . Been coming here about 2 years and it's always a pleasure ... I come here for maintenance visits and well as old injuries and new . They make me feel better every time . They really listen and care . I also bring my 11 year old daughter and she loves it as well . I literally tell everybody I know to come here . Sooo affordable as well. I 10/10 recommend .< /Review>

My husband & I have been coming to see Dr. Schott at the Joint for almost a year.  My body feels looser and I don’t have as much middle back pain as I did before I started my regular weekly adjustments here.  Recently, I had the privilege of being treated by the Clinical Director, Dr. Fenton and it was next level good!   He really customized my adjustments and listened to my body.  Also said that perhaps I was dehydrated and thus not as flexible. Thanks to all at the Sunset Joint, Lorraine, Dr. Schott and Dr. Fenton.</text>

<review>Figured I share the love on Google as well as Yelp. The Joint is amazing! I lost chiropractic coverage when I switched insurance and this place has saved me from so much pain - both physically and financially. Dr. V is great! He knew how to specifically target my trouble spots and help adjust them back into alignment - which is so much better than just a general adjustment. Being someone who’s pretty active with running, yoga, and dance it’s good to have my specific needs met. Also, Brian at the desk was friendly and helpful. Overall, a 5-Star experience.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Kernes is fantastic! He took away my chronic back pain and was so helpful I sent my mom to him because of her chronic headaches, and he’s helped her as well. We both experienced immediate relief after the first visit. I had no idea how painful it could be when your spine gets out of alignment but I had been living with chronic pain for over a year and now it’s basically all gone. I highly recommend the Joint at the Sunset Galleria.</Review><rating>5< /rating>< Pics>

Had a great experience every time I came to get an adjustment here- both Drs are excellent chiropractors! Being a military spouse, chiropractic isn't covered by my healthcare so price is always a factor. I got to have 7 treatments for the price of an initial visit at other chiropractic offices! Don't let price put you off. For me to be able to come in, get adjusted and go was perfect! Highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>This place is awesome.  First, the idea of having a franchise which caters to Chiropractics is brilliant.  Honestly, to pay $70 a months and then get an adjustment once a week for 4 weeks, and you just walk in not needing an appointment, Awesome.  Now for the service I receive is an all Thumbs Up.  I walked in two months ago, barely able to walk unable to bend my left knee, which had been a problem off-an-on for me over the last 10 plus years.  Two months later I'm walking without any limp; I'm able to do squats and am able to bend down and not just touch my toes but lay the palms of my hands on the floor.  These two activities is something which I have not been able to do for a very long time.  The doctors here are truly professional in both skill and personal handling.< /Review><userid>113569347538820308967<//userid>< Rating>

After two bad experiences with chiropractors who was just thinking about money and not only couldn't fix my neck pain but also were not able to find a problematic place in my neck, I came to Dr. Jhasmin Santizo. She's found the problem easily and fixed it in 3 minutes! She is a high level professional! Thank you doctor Santizo that you returned me my normal life back. I feel amazing!

<rate>5</rate><review>I love this location. All of my chiropractic experiences have been great. My favorite chiropractor is Dr. Benjamin Heredia. He is friendly, extremely knowledgeable and very professional. He has always listened and answered my questions with care. I've been seeing him for a while now and he is always able to get those really stuck areas of my neck and back. I always leave feeling so much better and with my spine very straight. I also noticed after several visits that my bones started holding the adjustments for longer periods of time making my visits less frequent. He is definitely one of the best chiropractors that has ever worked on me and I have tried many. I have had neck injuries in the past and he has helped me get the natural curvature back in my neck. I have so much less pain now and couldn't be happier. I highly recommend Dr Heredia and just this Joint location in general. Total life changer. Especially if you are extremely active like me.</review>< Resp>

Two words dr GORDON KERNES !!!!!
The best chiropractor by faaaaaaaar.
I’m a severe case and went to at list 20 different chiropractors in LA (not kidding for real) and let me tell you don’t waste your time,
Gordon is simply the best.
If I could get only $1 for each time the chiropractors told me “oh gosh you’re so stiff
I cannot adjustment you.. go home and stretch”

Gordon was able to adjust me every time I went to him in the first try !!!
Dr Gordon also has a special tool ( no-one has ) to pull you neck and it helped me so much.!!
I wanna personally thank you for the amazing work and obviously you’ll see more.

Dr Gordon kernes is the BEST 👍🙏⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Text>

<name>Devyn Rush<//name><rate>5<//rate><review>This place is fantastic. I have had hip pain for 10 years that had never been given the attention it needed. And then Dr. Heredia came to my rescue. My dad is a chiropractor on the east coast, so I was looking for a good one out here. I can't believe that there is a neighborhood chiropractic office that I can walk to and get the kind of adjustments and help that I get at The Joint! Not only has Dr. Heredia been helping my pain go away, he takes the time to sit with me and explain what's going on. He has shown more empathy and compassion than any other doctor I've worked with, aside from my own father. I think that says so much. This doctor really, really cares about his patients, and I couldn't be more thankful. 5+ Stars to The Joint!< /review>< user_id>

I'm always in and out in about five minutes and Dr. Heredia is my favorite. He really knows how to get me all back in shape. I was having terrible neck and middle back pain and since I've been seeing him I feel like myself again and not in pain like before. The other great thing are their wellness plans and the fact they take FSA. They have a ton of locations all over the US also. Thanks Dr. Heredia for being so great :)<//review>< userid>

OMG... Dr. Ben is the best chiro I have ever come across. I've been to so many over the years because of bad back issues and he has changed my life. He has given me such a better quality of life and is always giving me suggestions to help me feel better for long term wellness. I am so thankful that I found this place and him. I hope he always works here. If you are in pain, suffering and need someone you trust.. look no further. He's just the best human being and amazing chiro as well!!!</Text>

Don’t come to this shop. I try to drop off my UPS package and the staff said they cannot give me receipt and won’t scan my package.

What a joke? They don’t want to waste money for a receipt. If you drop off your box, you may not have any proof at all. Good luck!< /Text>

When I entered the shop, a employee was talking with another person (no work related) and she just ignored me. Another employee came to me few minutes later, asking me if he could help me, but quickly. I asked for International stamp sheets. Their price is ridiculous. The post office charhes $11.50/sheet. They charge $19/sheet! Will definitely not come back again to this place! Crazy prices and bad customer service!< /review>

The guy who runs this place is incredibly nice, cheerful, and helpful. He always has a big beaming smile and greets customers by name. He always explains all of the shipping options to customers to help them find the best rates and the options that best fit their needs. Beats going to the regular post office any day. 6 out of 5 stars.<//review>

My package disappeared from this location after dropping it off at the counter while the associate was with another client.
Recommendation: Don't drop your package here without receipt.
Check other reviews.<//text>

Always excellent service, very polite has always helped me with final wrapping of packages and offers choices on shipping.
This is the only place I take my items to mail. You can keep your regular ship to address on file so drop off goes really fast. I get excellent service at a reasonable price.<//review>

I was scheduled to drop off the van on a day when they were closed and I accidentally dropped my car keys in the overnight lock box! As you can imagine this caused a major problem for me. I called their number on a Sunday and left a message they were willing to come out and help me. Most places would NEVER check their message on a Sunday.

Don't use this place. I dropped off a pre-paid package to ship and they stole the device out of the box and shipped the empty box. They also won't give you a receipt for a pre-paid package drop off.</Text>

Always get my work done.
It would be good if Scanning service is also added. Sometimes it's needed to scan proper copy(for business), though I can scan/snap some copies using phone.
Overall, I'm a happy frequent customer.<//Text>

Simply called to find out information on the availability of a vehicle to rent and the guy who answered was incredibly rude and hung up on me before I could even ask to reserve the vehicle with him. I certainly will never use this locations service. Terrible customer service!<//text>

The guys at Postal Annex have earned my trust and business!  I just had a bad experience with a grumpy UPS driver who was complaining about picking up my packages.  David from Postal Annex immediately addressed the situation with a focus on providing excellent customer service.  He had a talk with the UPS driver and then assured me that I was a valued customer and that they wanted me to continue to bring my packages there.  They really went above and beyond to make sure to keep my business and it really worked!  Thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate it.</Text>

<Review>Extremely poor customer service.
Could not even indicate the cost of notarising a document requiring a single signature, on the phone. instead said ' i have a customer waiting and i do not have time for any conversation'.
By far the most horrible customer experience i have had in recent history.

I will just take my business to a nearby UPS store, who promptly indicated the cost.($10 per signature per document).<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Very bad experience! I will give 0 star if I could. The server left us aside and ignored us, even though we had asked him. He severed all other customers who had came later than us, and then finally got us what we want. Very disappointed and will never been there again! Don’t recommend!<//Review>

<time>1454956385600<//time><Text>DO NOT GO TO THIS POSTAL ANNEX. I wanted 4 passport size photographs. They charged me 14.99$ for first 2 passport sized photos, and another 14.99$ for the next 2. I called other postal annex offices and they charge 10.99$ for first 2 photos and another 5$ for the next 2 photos.

The guy in charge of this postal annex blatantly refused to refund me any amount. When I said that you are forcing me to write a bad review, he said "its your opinion, Thank you". In case you go there and find this guy (who is korean, I think), just GET OUT and go to another postal annex.

Horrible customer service, and inflated prices is what this POSTAL ANNEX is.</Text><Rating>1</Rating>< Resp>

<Review>A good selection of beers. The blonde was out on tap so I got a four pack. But how can you go wrong with "JUICY MOUTHFEEL" ???

A nice amount of outdoor seating but the dry heat and sun can dehydrate quickly. Make sure to drink a glass of water per pint or more.</Review>< Pics>

A lovely experience in an open and welcoming space. Excellent, welcoming service without being overbearing. Owner stopped to chat with us and was a very gracious host. Beer was also delightful with a good smattering of styles and unique approaches. Would recommend to visitors  and locals alike.<//Text>

<text>Discrimination - After patiently waiting in line, I get to the front only to be ignored and have the white Marin woman (just arriving) seated before me.   The beers are mediocre at best, and some are bad.  I so wish I could appreciate this brew pub that is walking distance from home.  But mediocre beer and DISCRIMINATION will never be my go to brew pub.<//text>< Date>

I love their beer, especially their IPA's.  I have not yet had the pleasure of enjoying my beer at the brewery since my wife is pregnant and is high risk during covid.  I have, however, purchased many of beers for pick up during these months.

Their IPA's are by far my favorite IPA's I've tasted.  I have enjoyed their other beers, like this lager in the picture.

Ordering online and pick up is super convenient.

I would highly recommend supporting this local business.  The workers are friendly, and the beer is excellent.  I'm looking forward to enjoying beers on site at some point in the future.<//text>

<Text>Great beer, great space. Lots of outdoor seating during covid with daily switches to the food menu. 3 lagers and 2 sours on draft which is a huge nod to their brewing abilities.<//Text><userid>107578601179756295205<//userid>< Resp>

Great beer selection in a large, inviting space with a lounging area, a children's play area, and outdoor seating which is dog friendly. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable about the beer, and approachable.
In addition to the bar snacks and farm-direct fruit, there are rotating food vendors on the patio. There's lots of bike parking inside.
If you're a teacher or on a bike (with a helmet), you get $1 off your first beer!<//Text>

Their menu is simple and similar to the variety prior to lockdown.  Outdoor seating is comfortable and at a safe distance.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Clean, bright, wide open space with a good variety of tasty beers all brewed on site. It's also super bike friendly - with indoor bike racks - and kid friendly - with a kids play space that includes kids sized furniture and a variety of toys.  Someone spill a little beer on you and you don't want to head out smelling like a brewery? They have cool t-shirts (I got one), hoodies (my husband wants one), and bike jerseys that will make sure you're visible on the road. Enjoy!</text>

Since the day this place opened it's been full of locals and their friends enjoying the relaxed atmosphere, plenty of space to spread out, and the yummy pop-up restaurants who come each evening. You can tell, from its immediate popularity, this town has been craving an establishment like Pond Farm Breweing Co for a long long time. The energy is electric and the beer is delish. there is no bad time to stop by Pond Farm so far!<//Text>

<text>This place has a great vibe and I can’t wait to bring my family here for years to come. Great beer and an open, airy space. LOVE the play area for kids (so huge for young families who are looking for family friendly places to bring their younger kids!). Owners and bartenders are super friendly - you can tell how much love and energy this place has. What an awesome addition to San Rafael.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Amazing new brewery in San Rafael. A big open and inviting indoor space with some outdoor seating available. Most importantly, the beers are EPICally good!! With so many microbreweries opening up around the Bay area, it is key that the beers are good. These far, far exceeded my expectations. A welcome addition to the area.<//text>

The atmosphere was soo cool and family friendly! Great seating options inside and outside and even for the kids. You even get a discount if you ride your bike. Finally, all the beers were delicious from the Hazy IPA to the Blonde Lager. I can't wait to come back and host a friends meetup here.< /Text>

We signed up our entire staff to complete Ms. Cook's AB 1172 Training.  I couldn't have been happier with the course.  It was very informative and  practical.  It's taught in a way that all service providers can apply this to primary and secondary levels.  I highly recommend taking this if you work in at a public or nonpublic school.< /text>

<review>I enjoyed this training experience with Katie Cook. She was easy to understand, clearly spoken with enough volume to hear & follow. The information shared was extremely helpful & valuable. I am surrounded by 6 children ages 2 & 3 year that screem & cry to communicate while my 2 year granddaughter uses words. This experience will help me share with other parents various ways to help their child communicate. Thank you so much Katie!<//review>< pics>

We used ATCC for our AB-1172 Training and found the training to be helpful for our population of autism 1 and autism 2 light students. Our faculty was able to complete the training in a thorough and timely manner. We are grateful for finding this resource and look forward to further trainings in the future. Thank you! Highly recommend!</Review>

Passed my initial competency assessment.  ATCC is a very good program. Katie was great.  it was clear to me that she has so much passion and very knowledgeable about her profession. She really made the whole competency a very fun experience for me and also gave me helpful feedback throughout the process. I felt very comfortable and relaxed during the competency assessment. Katie was also very helpful to answer my questions about pursing a career further in ABA field. Thank you so much Katie!</Review>

This is the best program for anyone looking to peruse their RBT certification. The program is easy to follow and the added bonus of having someone walk you through the certification steps is indispensable. Katie is extremely helpful and the option to meet with her for guidance throughout the program was a bonus. I did the Full Program and would highly recommend that option.< /review>

<Text>Katie Cook is phenomenal. I was hesitant about completing my competency. Katie reached out to me and reviewed with me how the competency would take place and what to expect. I told her I would get back to her within a week. I thought long and hard about it. A few hours after our conversation, I enrolled and for the competency. I completed it today and I must say Katie erased every piece of anxiety that I had. She is calming. She takes her time to thoroughly explain everything to you. She even gives you guidance on how to prepare for the RBT exam. I recommend Katie for anyone seeking to have the competency completed.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Hi everyone,
I highly recommend anyone who is struggling in obtaining supervision hours towards the Behavior Analyst exam. I came across this website because I didn't have a good experience with obtaining supervision hours, but once I spoke with Katie, she secured me that I could get all my hours by having a remote supervisor. This journey helped me understand how much I knew and what I was going to learn. Katie was lovely, professional, and understanding. I will certainly contact them again for other great services that they provide. Thank you Katie for everything.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I just finished the Online Training AB-1172 for Nonpublic, Nonsectarian School/Agency and this class flowed and was valuable for me.  I learned great information about the main components of behavior best professional practices in an easy to understand format.  The final evaluation was fair, concise and gave me a review of the important learning points of the class.  I will highly recommend this online training to my friends and colleagues.< /Text>

ATCC has helped me on the path of completing my RBT certification.  I was very hesitant thinking that the process was overwhelming and unsure how to get through all the information available..... how to obtain my end goal.   Katie Cook is amazing and a breath of fresh air!  She helped me through the process so much a by making me feel more at ease and confident in my abilities.  She made this an awesome experience.  Katie is so knowledgeable, and professional.  I would highly recommend ATCC.  Thank you!!< /Text>

I had the best experience educating myself at ATCC. Though I was new to this field, my instructor Katie cook helped me to learn the concepts with much ease and understanding. Her availability, flexibility and above everything her expertise in this field is very commendable. She made the RBT initial competency assessment, a cake walk for me. Also the materials and the lesson plans prepped me well for the RBT exam and I did pass the exam on the first attempt. I truly would recommend ATCC for anyone who seeks to pursue a rewarding career!!!< /review>

I was so confused about how to go about finding a BCBA and the process looked longer from my end!
This process was must faster, and even when I felt nervous Katie BCBA helped me feel less nervous and did a great job at it. If you are unsure about how to get started I would recommend using Autism Therapy Career College. Five Stars all the wayyyy :)< /Text>

I was a little worried doing my RBT training online but I it turned out to be a wonderful experience! ATCC is using an amazing curriculum that makes learning and understanding all the concepts very easy. Katie, the BCBA, was readily available to clarify anything I wasn't 100% sure about. She provided me with valuable guidance and prepared me for both the competency assessment and the RBT exam. I am usually a nervous exam taker but I was very confident going into the testing center and passed the exam on the first try.<//Review>

I came across ATCC out of curiosity for working as an RBT. From the start I felt like I belonged. ATCC made it easy to understand the material and you never feel alone. At the reach of an email, your questions or concerns are answered in a timely manner. Katie Cook was such a huge help during my journey through ATCC! I am at my dream job now and couldn't be happier! What started as a thought instantly became my heart.<//text>

I am so happy and GRATEFUL that I found ATCC to do the RBT certification. I went to the FULL RBT CERTIFICATION PROGRAM and it was amazing!! Katie was so supportive and thoughtful guiding me through the process until I finally became certified. It was definitely so much more than what I expected, a high level of professionalism and commitment to the field, I would recommend ATCC to anyone who wants to take advantage of all the offerings and resources they have available to continue learning about ABA. EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE.<//text>

When I first found Autism Therapy Career College, I thought it was too good to be true. I had been pursuing my RBT licensure without the guidance of an employer and supervisor. I reached the stage of the process where I needed a BCBA to approve my background check and to conduct the competency assessment. Not only did ATCC assure me that they would conduct a background check and attest to its completion, that they would conduct the competency assessment (with no need for a client), but also that they would sign the compassionate exception attestation (due to COVID-19) and would walk me through the RBT application to the BACB and it would be complete in the same session as the competency assessment. ATCC is incredibly communicative, invaluably helpful, and well worth every penny!<//Text>

This is gonna be my first review online, cause I do not like to share my experiences online but this course really deserve it! At the beginning I was scared about buying the course cause I thought about the possibility of being ripped of, but I did it and I’m glad to have taken the decision. It has all included, lot of subjects covered with examples, affordable price per week, which is awesome, and friendly support staff if assistance needed (I had to contact them for a request and received a quickly response). I’d give it 5 stars<//Text>

I have completed the RBT Training through Autism Therapy Career College. It was such an amazing experience in learning more about the principles of behavior and other ABA techniques. I am working on obtaining my RBT credentials and become a BCBA. I know that I am going to turn to ATCC for this help with furthering my ABA education. It is my passion in working with children who have different disabilities. If you share the same passion, then look to Autism Therapy Career College for the help. They are the best and have your best interest in heart.</Review>

Came in with my 2 friends for pedicures. Called beforehand and they said 3 chairs would be open. We got there and the chairs were open but only one tech was available. They didn’t start on my friends till I was done.I  asked for a pedicure with gel polish. No other services were offered to me but my friends were offered other services. Even still It was thee quickest pedicure I’ve ever gotten especially with gel polish. Water was room temperature even after I asked for more hot water. I asked for square and my nails are round. But I could’ve looked past that if the job wasn’t so rushed. I was being worked on for 15 mins 20 at the absolute max and I did not experience this friendliness everyone is speaking of. The shop itself is not the cleanest and needs updating. I don’t know why anyone would trust getting waxed here. If you’re looking for a quick in and out without any attention to details sure but this isn’t what I left the house for. Very underwhelming.</review>

It is a very expensive place for their poor service  and long wait. Tony the owner is very greedy and has no respect for the customers only for the money. He is very unprofessional and has no morals or respect to anyone or anything but money. He does not deserve a penny to be paid to his salon. My advice not to go there.<//text>

The shop needs a rehabilitation and need to be more  modern. It's old dirty walls. Nail Techs rushes and not aggressive at all. Didn't know someone was doing my nails unless I looked up.<//Text>

<Review>COVID-19 SURCHARGE ALERT!! All there service are now subject to a COVID-19 surcharge. On a $26 pédicure, there’s a $6 surcharge (23%). This is completely absurd!! This is a nail salon/spa...cleanliness should already be part of their “business plan”! Services used to be of good quality, but the quality has been decreasing significantly over time...now you’re just being rushed through!!

I've been coming here for over a year now. I've tried other Nail Salons, but none can compare to the skill set the staff that Tony's has for acrylic nails. I moved to the valley and still come here because when you find the best you don't go anywhere else! The wait is worth it, I promise!< /Review>

Came here with my mother last minute. We're on our mother daughter trip all the way from Florida. Called ahead was told we can come in that day. The place is not super fancy or anything. But it's clean and friendly. My mother got a gel manicure and pedicure. I got acrylics from Tony. Both were great. Attentive to detail. Haven't seen my mother that happy in long time. Now we're ready to goto Hollywood!< /review>

Anyway, she did a pretty good job, and I was satisfied with the overall job.  The nail polish has lasted for awhile too.

I would come back.

BTW there is a few parking spots in the back, but there's also street parking.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Review>It's a very noisy place.  If you're looking for a little peace, this is not the place to go.  The women who work there agree constantly talking to each other across the room very loudly.

It is reasonable, though.< /Review>< Name>

Small nail salon, not upscale

The ladies that do the nails do a great job, but the lady that answers the phone is very rude! I was told that no appointments can be made, to just "show up and wait", sorry Tony, but I won't be going there again.</Review>

ok they do great work. great. everyone here has exceptional technique — and I’m demanding. but it’s a zoo. tony is pretty rude, don’t seem to abide by appointments much, and clearly overbooks. but they do a knockout job. my mani never chips. it’s perfect until i take it off. i splurge on the full deluxe pedi which includes a heavenly minty mask they put from knees to toes, salt scrub, and brand new baby feet when it’s all done. all the female techs are super sweet and fastidious. i just wish tony was slightly more appreciative of his regular clients.< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This is too bad too. I used to like this place. I came in with a friend. We both were getting pedicures and were started at the same time. I decided to get the deluxe pedicure and treat myself. My friend got the regular. So now I'm done a whole 20 minutes before her and my pedicure sucked. I still have rough feet. There was no massage like i paid for. And the chick forgot to put the blue treatment into my cold water! In fact I am writing this review whilst sitting on the couch in this salon waiting for my friend to finish her basic pedicure. I would not recommend this place anymore.

The ladies were very nice very fast, and did a great job, I called prior to going for pedi and mani and told me one great price, then at check out the male gave me a 12$ diffrence price increase, I asked why, amd he got so mad at me and said, " you know our service! You know what they did, so don't treat me like that!" I said, excuse me, I called and I let the ladies know this is my first time here and in this area. He was furious, soooo rude, I was thinking of going back, but not any more, very rude guy, probably "Tony"</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Another place in Crescent City that people can go to see the bay, watch boats coming or going, see the ground squirrels, the gulls & ravens close up & wind surfers! Also a good shot of Battery Point Lighthouse. There is a Historical marker about the SS Emidio as you drive into Beach Front Park. There's a dog park for both little & big pups 🐾.  And you can have outdoor family get togethers & grill up your famous whatevers & enjoy the large grassy fields. Near the CC swimming pool & the Marine Hospital. Only drawback: you have to drive by the sewer plant to get to Battery Point. But it only smells for a moment. Enjoy!! 😄< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>This just a small piece of the ship S.S. Emido in a center corner of the park, right on Front St. This ship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine very soon after Pearl Harbor. The torpedo disabled the navigation (rudder, I think) and it drifted into the local rocks and sunk. It is the only ship sunk by the Japanese on the mainland coast.<//review><Gmap_id>0x54d0664bac731a71:0x1664eae4c9112a52<//Gmap_id>< name>

<Text>I have a full sleeve and it was all done by Ryan Christy from True At Heart Tattoo/Raygun Tattoo.  Ryan first of all is amazingly talented.  He is super chill, family man and really listened to my ideas throughout the entire process.

He suggested some colors that I would have not originally chosen as part of my arm's story but am so glad I listened to his recommendations because I am THRILLED with how it turned out.

I get stopped at least once or a twice week with people commenting on my sleeve.  If you are looking for a solid artist, ask for Ryan.  He is the best!</Text>< gmap_id>

True At Heart, is probably one of the best shops I have been to , hands down in the US. The guys are cool, talented, and on point with every piece I have seen come out of there. This is why I chose them, when I decided to get my sleeve done.<//text>

<text>These guys mean business! It’s a straight forward tattoo shop, clean facility and welcoming atmosphere. I’ve been going to Ryan Christy for a while and he never disappoints. I give him my random ideas and he transfers it to skin using his rad artistry. He’s authentic and knowledgeable in his trade and has been for a very long time. Overall, this shop is a great place to start if your looking for good quality work and a place to establish yourself for ongoing skin art sessions.</text>< Date>

I highly recommend this tattoo shop! My boyfriend recommended this place after he got his half sleeve done by Craig. His tattoo came out AMAZING so I knew I’d be in good hands. Craig was my artist as well and he did an amazing job! I love love loooove how my ink came out. I will definitely return if I decide to get any more tattoos :)<//Review>

< Review>
I have been going to Raygun tattoo for well over 7 years now, my artist is Ryan Christy. I have always felt comfortable going into the shop to draw up new pieces of art to add to my collection. Ryan has always worked very professionally and efficiently with me. I always enjoy going into the shop even if it’s just for a consultation, they really make it a good environment to be in. Not to mention you get some of the best conversation with Ryan and his brother Craig. They are truly top notch artists and individuals. I love the work I get done here at Raygun/True at Heart</Review>

Quality work and a passion for the job. Ryan and Craig make you feel welcome and its always a great experience. Been going to Raygun for years they are part of my family now.  As an artist, they fully work with me on the artwork and the end result is always beyond my expectations. The professionalism is always apparent in both their work and approach. The atmosphere is never heavy or uncomfortable.<//Review>

Awesome shop! I came in looking for merch and artwork and was overwhelmed with how cool the space was. Very cool artwork and beautiful designs. A chill spot to visit or go get some work done. I ended up sticking around for an hour chatting with Stuart P. - awesome dude!  Definitely go check out True At Heart Dana Point!<//Review>

So I wanted  a tattoo and started looking on Yelp at different places. I really liked the images they were showing. Very detailed and the shading was on point. My tattoo artist was very patient and thorough with my consultation. In fact my consultation took longer than my tattoo but don't get me wrong he really took his time with it as well.  shaded it and made it exactly what I wanted. I felt bad because his 1st draft after he had put it on my arm before he inked it up, I felt was too large and I asked for it to be made smaller and he had to redesign it all over again. That says a lot and now he has a customer for life and I  have another appointment with him on Thursday for my 2nd tattoo I can hardly wait and you better believe I will post a photo of that as well. Thanx so much Craig you rock!<//text>

I have been going to Raygun for years now and my artist is Ryan Christy. I have moved out of state and travel back several times a year to get work done. I would not go anywhere else. The shop is really clean and professional. Ryan is very talented and patient. He does amazing work and I would refer him to anyone looking to get high quality tattoos!<//text>

<text>This place rocks.  It was recently remodeled, is clean and sanitary.  I have used Ryan Christy to do my work for over a decade, and keep coming back to him.  Give him your ideas and he’ll work with it and use his artistic skills to create a quality tattoo.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcf050fa36a259:0x3055d8eba9f905d2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Raygun Tattoo is clean and reliable tattoo shop.  Ryan Christy and Craig Christy are talented artist that will give you an positive experience with the whole process from the art work to the healing of the tattoo.  They are always on the cutting edge from their machines to the ink they use.  I have tattoos that Ryan and Craig have done that are fifteen plus years old and they still hold up to today’s standards.  Go to Raygun for a quality tattoo and an awesome experience.<//text>

I wanted to get a tattoo for the longest time and a buddy of mine says this shop was the best choice. He put me in contact with his artist Ryan and he helped me get exactly what I want with great detail and good pricing. Lighted hand so not as much pain and a very welcoming vibe I don’t like getting ink enywere else, if you are looking for your first tattoo or your already ahead but wat to find a different shop where you can be happy and satisfied with the end result, then this shop is where you should go</text>

<Text>I got my first tattoo from Raygun nearly 20 years ago and have been a customer ever since. I've probably had more 40 hours of work done by Ryan Christy at this point.

Have been coming here for years now, all my work has been done by Craig Christy and he is beyond AMAZING. A true artist, awesome ideas, is patient, super talented, works with you on ideas, placement etc. Brougjt my bf here recently from out of town and Craig completed his sleeve, now he’s hooked! The shop itself is clean, they pride themselves on the work they do. Go here, you won’t be disappointed!!</text>

Ryan has been my go-to person for the past 6 years! I have been a repeat customer and referred many people to him who were also just as pleased with his work.
If you’re thinking of getting a tattoo Raygun is the place to go to!<//review>

This place is the place to go if you want great service awesome staff and true art work I’ve had 6 tattoos done with Ryan christy and he’s my main man he’s very flexible with scheduling and returns calls and texts in a very timely manner his artwork is great the amount of time and care he puts forth is amazing if your not sure what you want he can sit down with you and go over and hand draw a draft to see if you like it he’s very professional and a awesome guy to work with I highly recommended working with Ryan. If you want a well done tattoo done by a true artist ryan christy is your man<//review>

Hands down the best tattoo place in the OC! It’s hard to find real “artist” in the tattoo industry. Ryan Christy has done an amazing job on every tattoo he’s done for me. He even did a cover up that no one else would even attempt to do! Others told me to have it lasered first. Very talented guy. I get so many compliments on all my tattoos that he’s done. People always stop me and ask “Who did your ink?” I’ve moved to Kansas and now Arizona....and still travel to see “my” tattoo guy! Lol Thank you Ryan for all your artistic creativity!  ~Billie Ann</Text>

This is my favorite dispensary! Weedmaps Compton suggested I come here & haven’t gone anywhere else since! They have cheap weed with good quality & they are a late night dispensary open till midnight ! This will always be my favorite cannabis store. Thank you curly for great customer service!<//Review>

Stopping here. The customer service here was amazing I really appreciate that because that is something that really matters. I had got the 5 gram eighth deal which was pretty cool.

I have been looking for a new cannibals dispensary in Compton for a while and I finally found a 2cap one. Really good customer service and friendly bud tenders like Dory! They’re have good selection of live resin cartridges and really good prices on edibles and tinctures!. I have definitely found my new shop.<//Review>

< Review>
I came in for my first time to the west coast to visit with my brother and sister-in-law. I asked them where I could go to get some “items” for our 6 day hike and this was the random place my brother chose “his job does not allow any type of consumption” so I walk in and for my first time buying it- it was a pleasant experience! There is one particular employee (ALEX) was very knowledgeable and more than helpful in making sure I was happy with my decision. Once I made it back I needed to revisit and the girl there even remembered me (probably because I sound country AF I’m from WV) I highly recommend this place to anyone that is visiting this area. I couldn’t be any more pleased with this store. I plan on visiting my brother about 3-4 times a year and I am happy to say that they now have a customer for life! Thank you to Alex. Next trip is set for September 2021 and I hope the same people are working and can help me again! I hope the white recluse pre-rolls are still on point and burn slow!< /Review>

Came in to nwa and maxi help me out with some fire top shelf pre rolls. She told me to check in on Yelp and follow them on ig to get hooked up daily deals. They alway have great customer service and make sure you leave happy with you purchases. I found them on weedmaps. They have 5 gram 8th and live resin carts and wax. On daily deal you can get 50% off the wax. Starting at $5 bucks. The vapes here are real and cheap and they have cheap weed start at $20 cap. The guard are friendly and make sure we are all safe and it’s always clean in here. They wear gloves and mask to serve the patient so I’ll definitely say you have to come see the best dispensary in Compton<//Text>

First time patient here and Nae offered the Best service. Their selection is great and I will be back very soon! And she offered Galaxy gummies but I’ll save that for my next trip! I can’t think of a better dispensary in La!< /Review>

Came to the nearest dispensary near me and nugz with attitude came right up. They have the cheapest weed deals in all of Compton. Tiny hooked up with a 5g eighths for my first time! With a upgrade I got a moon rock joint that hit different. I will definitely be coming back for p.a to come get the same deal. Next visit I'll be trying their new plug and plays.

always come here and I love it it’s one of the best dispensaries in Compton and I’ve been to a few. It’s a 20 cap shop for sure! Ang always comes and serves me with great costumer service. They  have really good deals on the moonrock and the stndrd edibles. I came in today and bought some moonrock along with the stiiizy carts & plug n play. I always leave here satisfied. Plus they keep the place clean and sanitized. They keep gloves on and they always have their mask on. They have cheap weed and deals on literally everything including edibles. This is a place that I will forever be loyal to. PREROLLS WEEDMAPS CHEAP WEED BUD SHOP ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<//Text>

<date>1616393655612< /date><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Chyna had served me today and was very friendly. This was my first time coming here and I really appreciate everything. I had came here and got the first time deal and they were really good about it because most shops really be stingy with the deal. I had got a 20 cap and it was really fire. This is definitely my new spot in Compton to go to always. I had also bought a couple of half gram stiizys and got one free that was really a good deal. I really appreciate everything ladies I definitely will be being a friend in so we can get some great deals.<//Review><username>Nathan Alvarez</username>< gmapID>

Nae gave me better than excellent service. I found this place on Weedmaps about 2 years ago and just found it again. Their selection of bud is even better tho. And I got a free pre roll with my purchase. Will definitely be back very soon from Vegas.</Text>

Fire 🔥 all day best weed in Compton. Best product and deals I've found so far. Check out the daily deal and ask to be apart of the exclusive text. Maxi invited me to a cinco de mayo event tomorrow with 5 gram on the fire weed. If you like live resin they have vapes and wax available at a cheap weed price<//Review>

<Review>I came in today looking for the best flower deals. This is the closest cannabis store to me so I had to give it a try. Juice and tiny hooked it up with a killer deal I walked out with everything I need and some. The best bud shop in Compton by far. The madras vapes are the cheapest I’ve found in a LOONG time! Like wow.  Not only did I get a freebie for my purchase but happy hour too? The best customer service. Thank you ladies<//Review>< Name>

Best weed shop in Compton. Ask for a daily deal and get fire cheap weed prices for 10 gram, 14 gram and 28 grams. The free dab bar gets you really high before you leaves. Ladiii hooked me up with a free pre roll. She have great customer service and took me all the deals. She took me to look them up on weedmaps. I'll be back for 5 gram 8th on Sunday pad party and she said ill get hook up with alot of edible and cape freebies<//Review>

Looked on weedmaps and found the best dispensary in Cpt. This spot has BOGO deals and dummy fire eighths for only $20. The Patient Appreciation Day sales always mean you'll get a hook up. N the CBD oil and CBD Edibles hit. top shelf joints are surprisingly not shake/trim and are free with a follow. This is now where I go for cheap weed and cheap wax thank yall. Nelly helped me suffciently love her!<//Text>

<Review>This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Mc helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the variety of everything they got!! Also check them out on the 2nd of june they are having amazing 5 gram eighth deals! Best 5 grams for $20 I've ever had! And got a moonrocks joint for only 10 dollars as an upgrade! After she still hooked me up with a free dab for spending over 75 here! This is my #1 go to late night dispensary!!!</Review><GmapID>0x80c2cd3e830be691:0x1154a05bffbc8ada<//GmapID>< pictures>

I just found a late night 20 cap dispensary in Compton on weed maps today. They have the best prices on west coast cure pods and plug n plays which i stocked up on today. They also gave me an upgrade on my eighth for a half gram of wax. They also give out free dabs with a donation and pre rolled joints. I also picked up a one of a kind glass bong as a gift for my friend they gave me a great  discount on it for my first time! Bratz was amazing and helped me out with my entire transaction ! I’ll be back soon< /Review>

Best dispensary in Compton found them on Weedmaps. They have 5 gram 8th and 50% off deals . Ask about their fire daily deals.  They have the best 20 cap ever. Ask for maxi,  this team has the best customer service in town. Open late night dispensary and pet friendly dispensary</review>

After that she proceeded to take me on a shop tour giving me all kinds of goodies based on the amount I spent. Idk if all the bud tenders are this friendly but she was a great representative of this shops product and staff. I will be coming here again.< /text>

This is THE best dispensary near me hands down! I love coming here for so many reasons. The whole entire staff has the best energy and are always happy to see me just as I am happy to see them. Besides the A1 customer service, this Compton dispensary has the coolest bongs, dank moonrock joints, a dab bar, plug n play, live resin carts and the most fire weed!! You can find them on weedmaps Compton. Check them out everyone!! Bring a friend, tell your cousins!! Guaranteed to make your day better.< /text>

Found a great 20 cap dispensary in Compton brats helped me out and gave me an extra half gram on my Quarter. I also picked up some sweeter high edibles which are fire. next time I come in I’m definitely going to grab some West Coast cure pre-roll and some OC farm Molly ranches.< /Review>

Chyna had told me to come here on Saturday for the deal on the wax today and here I am then had such an amazing time the customer service is the best I notice the selection of edibles had grew even more. Usually I just get the standard only but this time she had me try the galaxy gummy and they were amazing as well. Everyone should check this dispensary in Compton out they will get you right. Check them out on Weedmaps to see the selection of weed and more! Yes< /Text>

The coolest cannabis store near me🔥 I always feel so welcomed and joyful when I step in this Compton dispensary. Sometimes I just stop but because they are the only spot with free dabs near me, I love it. I always feel hooked up. No other late night dispensary provides quality service, cheap weed, Plug n Play, etc... This last time I was in there, there was a line so one of the girls sparked up a danky moonrock joint and passed it to us! It’s always a vibe in here. Thanks to Jules, I tried a live resin cart for the first time and I fell in love! It’s a potent high in discretion which is just what I was searching for. Check them out, specifically west coast cure!! Ya won’t regret it. My favorite the best in town< /review>

<text>I always come here and I love it it’s one of the best dispensaries in Compton and I’ve been to a few. It’s a 20 cap shop for sure! Chyna always comes and serves me with great costumer service. They  have really good deals on the moonrock and the stndrd edibles. I came in today and bought some moonrock along with the stiiizy carts & plug n play. I always leave here satisfied. Plus they keep the place clean and sanitized. They keep gloves on and they always have their mask on. They have cheap weed and deals on literally everything including edibles. This is a place that I will forever be loyal to. PREROLLS WEEDMAPS CHEAP WEED BUD SHOP ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I was looking for a dispensary near me that have $20 eighths and i’m so happy i found this marijuana shop near me! I came in on a budget looking for some cheap weed. I got a 5G eighth for my first time and a free dab! Dory really hooked it up.  They have everything here y’all, $25 eighths, Plug n Play, moonrock joints, west coast cure joints, bongs, friendly tenders & a great selection. I will for sure be returning! Especially since they have a deal running every day and coming foe Mother’s Day They are also a late night dispensary!! No other Compton dispensary is open till midnight like them! They really are the best in the city.< /Review>

First of all I appreciate the service and how nice everybody is.juice was amazing an knew all about stiiizy they also carry stiiizy 1:1. Every time I come in here they’re trying to hook me up wit some type of deal. They weed is cheap. It’s the nearest shop  to me.  I love that they are on weed maps and the moon rocks and Edibles slap!!!! I stay coming here for moon rocks! And the madres they have them at a cheaper price. Highly recommend!</Text>

This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Angie helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new plus I was getting the 50% off for the daily deal. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the variety of everything they got!! Also check them out on the 15th they are having gnarly deals! Best 5 grams for $20 I've ever had! And got a moonrocks joint for only 10 dollars as an upgrade! After she still hooked me up with a free dab for spending over 75 here! I will be here for your 420 party<//Text>

Best dispensary in Compton. I found them on weedmaps when I was looking for 5 gram eighth. They was open late night dispensary and I was able to come in last minute. Maxi help me out with a great deal on 3 full gram stiiizy carts . She said they carry the best live resin carts in town. I like how they follow cdc rules and wear gloves and mask. This marijuana store had the best customer service I’ve ever seen in a weed shop. I felt appreciated the how visit by the whole staff. The guard even makes you feel safe while your there by staying on the floor and calming down issues before it starts. I’ll be making this my go to shop for now on< /Text>

chyna had helped me today and really gave me a good understanding since i’m new. i really appreciate the first time experience. I originally came in here to buy a wax pen they didn’t have the brand i wanted but i end up trying a dime cart and that was a great choice ! what i really like about this dispensary is they have a great selection of everything even cbd pens i will definitely try one next time since they have a lot of benefits. i also appreciate the freebies they gave i got a 250 mg chief treat edible and it’s fire !!! thank you guys this is the best dispensary in compton i definitely recommend this to anyone and go ahead and check them out on weedmaps also ! will be back on patient appreciation day on the second for the crazy deals on wax and weed😍<//Text>

Best dispensary in Compton, Angie helped me out with some fire 20 cap! Looked them up on weedmaps and boom I’m here! I got to pick up some live resin cure pods! And got a fire live resin dab. They hooked me up with a fire pre roll and edible for the first time! They have the best customer service in ever!< /Review>

Shoutout to Dory for making my first time experience really good. I usually go to the dispensary across the street but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in years !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams.< /review>

Chyna had helped me out today and was really nice. I come here all the time because this is really the best dispensary ever in Compton. They got the best $20 8ths!! Yes 20 a cap of some fire. I had also picked up a plug and play for the first time and I really recommend them to everyone who do vapes you guys will really like this for a fact ! What I like about this place is that they really got the best deals ever with daily deals and really good freebie items! I definitely will be here on the 2nd for the 5 gram eighths deals.

This is the only marijuana shop you need to go to because they have it ALL! Dab bar, west coast cure carts, great customer service, great deals, Plug n Play and more… I like to come during happy hour because they give a deal on whatever you’re looking for. It’s always a good time when I come in here because the staff is so genuine and helpful. I would definitely recommend them to a friend or family member who’s looking to try cannabis for the first time or is already a connoisseur. You won’t get let down!

<review>I love nugs with attitude this is the best dispensary near me I found them on weedmaps and I love them they have cheap bongs and also $20 eighths and there also a late night dispensary I love it here they always find a way to hook me and my friends up I always leave satisfied. Trust once you come one time you keep coming back they have 5g eighths  and they also have for 20 dollar deals and Moonrock joints. They also give out free dabs when she spent $20 and they have a different deals every single day on top of that they also have parties with a goodie bags and more. They have a lot of 420 dills posted everywhere inside the shop.</review>< pictures>

<review>Maxi hooked me up with some exclusive popcorn for 20 cap. Its their best buds all together and you get super high on it. Look them up on weedmaps to see their menu. They have fire live resin carts like sticky and West coast cure. I bring my puppy here because they are a pet friendly dispensery. Ask for the honey cocaine og , its one of my favorite bud shop.  They have the best dispensery near me on customers service and I'm always satisfied with the experience here.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Best dispensary in compton, look them up on weedmaps. They have great daily deal and 20 cap special. Ask for cookie and maxi. They are my #1 and #2 hands down. They tell me they best deal for my money and they hook it up. I come in with a bad attitude and they will make sure I leave super happy by reminding me that everything will be ok and they get me some fire to help me feel good and they give me great customer support. I love this compton dispensary. Ask how to get 5 gram 8th and try the $5 upgrade for some fire gifts. And make sure you spend the wheel. Thanks guys for making my day 😍< /review>< pictures>

<Text>I went into this dispensary for the first time, and kira was my server. She did an amazing job by helping find the best options for me. Her enthusiasm and willingness to go out of her way to really explain each item to me was just phenomenal. Along with having a great variety of options and outstanding customer service, this shop is very clean and aesthetically pleasing. I ended up leaving with a half oz of Purple Kush and sour gummy edibles which I cannot wait to try. I will definitely be a returning patient here!</Text>< pictures>

I really enjoyed coming here but after this I will no longer spent a dime at this location I spent over $100 this vape was half empty first of all they sold me pods and didn’t explain I had to buy a battery I had to go back then I call them to see if they can do anything for me because is not right the employee who answered was very rude no apology what so ever she hung up the phone and didn’t care if you visit this place make sure you check your products before stepping out the door.the product is cracked as you can see on the photos the last picture is the other side of the pod is completely dry</Text>

I came to this dispensary in compton ca and was helped out by juice today. She gave such great customer service skill she knew all about the Stiizy carts I love the gelato one and you guy had have an full grams.  They also have live resin witch is strong at a low price. If your in the compton this is near you. The weedshop was very clean and they also carry the plug and plays. When I checked out they gave me a free pre-roll. I love it here it super cheap an net by my house.< /Text>

This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton, I come here all the time for the $20 8ths but today Chyna had told me about the dub deals and I end up doing that for some fire weed. They always got the best deals ever all the time and definitely will not disappoint you. They have everything at this dispensary from edibles and also CBD items they have an amazing selection of that so you guys definitely gotta check it out. I found them on Weedmaps.<//Text>

I come here all the time for just flower usually but Chyna had talked me into trying some fire  wax for the weed I had bought. What I really like what you can do is once you buy weed the price gets knocked down for the wax. This dispensary never disappoints me ever they will make sure you will leave out of here with what you want. I can’t wait to see what’s up with the patient appreciation day coming up on the 2nd they always got them poppin plus with the great deals.</text>

This dispensary always got the best deals ever this is why I love coming here. Chyna had helped me out and had hooked me up with a deal and I got 10% off edibles. I had picked up the medicated canna candys and they are really good and had got me really high for 100mg of thc. I usually come in and pick up the standard gummies but she had put me on something new plus I was getting the 10% off for the daily deal. This is really the best dispensary ever in Compton I really appreciate the customer it’s always the best. Check them out on Weedmaps as well to see the verity of everything they got!!<//review>

Looked up the nearest cannabis shop in Compton ans nwa came right up, with all the great reviews i had to check it out. This cannabis shop has the biggest selection of weed and at such a cheap price. Ive tried so many shops on weedmaps, but nothing came close to nwa. The top shelf pre rolls are stright fire and the cannabis quality is more than expected. Next time I come I definitely will be teyinf the Madre vapes ang suggested. Amazing experience thank you ladies for that live resin dab you hooked me up with. And got my stiiizy birthday cake cart deal!!!< /Review>

I came to this dispensary for the first time last week. Brix really hooked me up with the first time deal. I left with more free items than I what I actually bought. Service was great! When I got home and tried everything the quality was 100% I will definitely be going back to this dispensary. It is well worth the 20 min drive from where I live. The free dab was 🔥🔥 too. Everyone was super friendly. Hoping Brix is always there when I go because she was super nice and I also appreciated the social distancing.</text>

Cheap weed. Bongs for raffle. Many many more!< /review>

They literally have everything that you need in this shop for all the prices. There’s not too many shops that have $15 8th and that’s amazing. I had bought a Dime cart for my first time I usually buy something called a oc pharm pen which they have but I went out and tried something new. She had also gave me this really good tasting edible by LA famila for free !!! For spending more than $75. This is going to my number one shop to go to in Compton I will always be coming here. Check them out on Weedmaps as well for the selection they have they really have everything even CBD pens for those who only do CBD!!

Usually I just get the standard only but this time she had me try the galaxy gummy and they were amazing as well. Everyone should check this dispensary in Compton out they will get you right specially with the fire $20 cap and $1 dabs for happy hour.

<Text>I found a fire 20 cap on Weedmaps! I am very impressed with their service , dory gave me too tier service. They’re the only Shop with good deals on plug and plays and stndrds. I came and picked up an eighth and they gave me 5 grams on the 20 cap shelf; next time I come in im getting moon rocks they’re  only place that has flavored ones in the city!</Text>< pictures>

The coolest cannabis store near me🔥 I always feel so welcomed and joyful when I step in this Compton dispensary. Sometimes I just stop but because they are the only spot with free dabs near me, I love it. I always feel hooked up. No other late night dispensary provides quality service, cheap weed, Plug n Play, etc... This last time I was in there, there was a line so one of the girls sparked up a danky moonrock joint and passed it to us! It’s always a vibe in here. Thanks to Ang, I tried a live resin cart for the first time and I fell in love! It’s a potent high in discretion which is just what I was searching for. Check them out, specifically west coast cure!! Ya won’t regret it. My favorite<//text>

Love this place. People are awesome and tree is fire. I highly recommend this place. I had went to chyna and she really hooked it up with the daily deal they had today! I had got a 4 gram 8th today which is pretty cool and the beat part is that they have deals like this all the time. This will always be the best shop ever in Compton there customer service is always good and you will not leave this shop disappointed at all. They are really COVID safe everyone is wearing masks and gloves which I think is very important. Check them out on Weedmaps they got some bomb stuff!!</text>

The stiizy are the best price in compton. The the other shop near by don't hook me up as much as nwa. This is my new shop! The cannabis here is more than I thought I would be, gas ⛽. Next I want the the plug and plays tiny said would the best. Thank you guys<//Review>< Rate>

I was looking for a dispensary near me and found this one! My whole experience from checking in to walking out was so dope! I came looking for some cheap weed honestly & got hooked tf up. I got a 5G eighth for my first time and a free dab! They have everything here y’all, $20 eighths, Plug n Play, moonrock joints, west coast cure carts, bongs, friendly tenders & a great selection. I will for sure be returning! Especially since they have a deal running every day. They are also a late night dispensary!! No other Compton dispensary is open till midnight. The best in the city. Look for angie always has the best recommendations for my needs.< /review>

The best Compton dispensary you can go to! I’m so glad weedmaps near me helped me find this location because I had an amazing experience. From the receptionist, to the bud tenders (especially cocoa) , to the weed quality, everything is on point!! I like that they carry $25 eighths because I’m balling on a budget. Who doesn’t love cheap weed? They have the coolest bongs, lit dab bar and the best moonrock joints. The give free dabs with $20 donations too. There’s no comparison here. I got a 5 gram eighth for being a first timer, a couple joints & an invitation to their next party on Feb. 2nd which I’ll definitely be attending! Can’t wait. If you want to try a new Compton cannabis dispensary, look no further.<//Review>

<review>Looked up the nearest cannabis shop in Compton ans nwa came right up, with all the great reviews i had to check it out. This cannabis shop has the biggest selection of weed and at such a cheap price. Ive tried so many shops on weedmaps, but nothing came close to nwa. The top shelf pre rolls are stright fire and the cannabis quality is more than expected. Next time I come I definitely will be teyinf the Madera vapes tiny suggested.

<text>The best Compton dispensary you can go to! I’m so glad weedmaps near me helped me find this location because I have an amazing experience. From the receptionist, to the bud tenders, to the weed quality, everything is on point!! I like that they carry $20 eighths because I’m balling on a budget. Who doesn’t love cheap weed? They have the coolest bongs, lit dab bar and the best moonrock joints. The give free dabs with $20 donations too. There’s no comparison here. I got a 5 gram eighth for being a first timer, a couple joints & an invitation to their next party on Feb. 2nd which I’ll definitely be attending! Can’t wait. If you want to try a new Compton cannabis dispensary, look no further.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I usually go to the dispensary across the street but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in years !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy Joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1613541945382, 'text': 'We love to hear how your experience was, so awesome that your first time was great.

Maxi was my budtender and she hooked me up with a 20 cap 8th that was sticky and smell so good. She told me I can get a 5 gram 8th on March 2 for a appreciation day and they will have bogo deals on edible and vapes. She said ask for the live resins carts cuz they taste the best and are at a great price. Come see them for your early morning dispensary<//text>< pics>

Fire! I found a fire 20 cap dispensary on weed maps and it was nearby in Compton. They hooked me up with a fire 5gram eighth on the top shelf. They have the highest thc percentages in the city. I picked up a west coast cure 3 pack of joints that were hella dank. Bratz helped me out with some fire edibles from stndrd and invited me back to a 5G eight party. I’ll be back soon<//Review>

< Review>
Shoutout to Chyna for making my first time experience really good. I usually go to the dispensary near my house but that dispensary was closed so I went on Weedmaps and found this place. I was so amazed that they had a dab bar I haven’t seen one in so long !!! The deals they got here is amazing I had bought some fire for 20 a cap and on top of that I had came on patient appreciation day so I got a crazy deal and end up getting 5 grams for $20!!! I also had end up trying a Juicy Joint the one that’s wrapped in keef and it was so fire and the best part is I only paid $5 and regular price goes for $15!!! Because here they do upgrades when you buy a Eighth or more. Keep the customer service up guys it’s wonderful and I will definitely be bringing more people in so I can continue getting that great deal with the 5 grams..love this place</Review>

I love everything here !  I bought some bomb edibles they always good ones for great prices. This is the only dispensary near me that has the THC lemonade i like . I brought in a first timer and they got a discount on their bong. The dab bar is honestly my favorite part next to my budtender Sugar who offered me a bunch of desls . Everyone in there is sweet , but the deals are sweeterrr . BEST compton dispensary!!!<//Review>

Best dispensary in Compton, Eva helped me out with some fire at only $20 on their NWA’s finest shelf. Their top shelf joints are the best and free with a follow. Customer service is always great here. Thanks ladies! I found the shop on Weedmaps, it is the closest cannabis dispensary near me. They are also a late night dispensary open until 12am. They carry brands like STIIZY, DIME, & WCC<//text>

I’m so glad I had came here for patient appreciation day they really got all then best deals This is probably my third time being here and out of all the dispensaries I have been to a Compton this is really the best one because they got choices from $15 a cap and up in the cool part about it is that the weed is really good also today I had came in to check out some disposable Vape pens and Chyna had sold me the West coast cure pen and also a dime pen it is really cool are usually go for the sqrl find trying something different today. Definitely will be bringing all the homegirls in here soon. Cant wait to go to the next patient appreciation day on the 2nd. Thank y’all!!</Review>

I come here all the time and Bratz hooks it up all the time. I always get moonrocks when I come in as apart of my upgrade on my eighth. Their Madre carts are great ! I found them on weedmaps and I don't regret it one bit. I love the oc pharm moonrocks and the white recluse joints because of the cdb ! Thanks again ladies<//Review>

Came to this late night dispensary in Compton because they offer $1 dabs bar . Chyna  helped me out with the first time patient deal. I got 5 grams of marathon og and a gram of moonrock for only $30 bucks. Chyna showed me some fire bongs on sale and she told me to come party with them on april 2 for appreciation day. I’ll definitely say this is the beat weed shop in Compton. They have a lot of selection in live resins carts like stiiizy and now they carry raw garden battery. Come get taken care of with the best service in town and make sure you have your mask when you come. And check them out on Weedmaps!! And be sure to pull up for there 4/20 party< /Text>

Nwa is the best 20 cap cannabis dispensary in Compton. Stay stocked up with stiizy carts and plug n play which are really hard to find. every time I come in I get a $10 gram Moonrock‘s and oc pharm molly ranchers. Today’s my birthday and Bratz hooked it up with some thc drinks and gnarly edible cupcakes! I love it here</Review>

<review>I found this great dispensary in Compton on weed maps. Bratz helped me out with a 5g eight for $35 my first visit which was real cool! I picked up a plug n play cartridge and they have the best price for them in the city. They have tons of variety of flowers and edibles including stndrds and sweeter high edibles. I had moonrocks for the first time for a $10 upgrade and it’s my new vibe ! Bratz and the girls did an amazing job this is my new go to<//review>< pics>

<name>Sammy Leo</name><date>1611974487652</date><rating>5< /rating><Text>Nugz with attitude is my fav Compton cannabis dispensary near me i come here on the daily either to take a dab or to pick up bud. They have a variety of products and the best customer service in the city. I was so happy to find plug n play & west coast cure carts here! They also have stiizy carts. If you're looking to pick up any of the following, come on Thursdays because they give vape deals every Thursday. On Tuesday you get a 4.5 gram 8th of any shelf which is awesome. Sunday you can get a 4 gram 8th come during happy hour 4:20-6:20. Sometimes I'll just come in to hit the dab bar or pick up a couple moonrock joints. Whatever it is I'm looking for, I come to this cannabis store for it cause they got it all! Thanks to Evelyn and all the girls here for their hospitality and warm energy!! Check them out people you will not regret it they got edibles vapes wax bongs etc anything you need they got even the packwoods. Btw they open as early as 8am and close at 12am everyday which is awesome. Make sure to stop by Feb 2nd patient appreciation day #5GRAM 8TH #SQRL PODS #stiizy #dime #westcoastcure #plugnplay #dabbar #edibles #bestshopnearme< /Text>< Pictures>

The best Compton dispensary you can go to! I’m so glad weedmaps near me helped me find this location because I had an amazing experience. From the receptionist, to the bud tenders, the weed quality, the cleanlines, everything is always perfect!! I like that they carry $30 carts for my pen. They have the coolest pipes, great dab bar and the best moonrock deals. They give free dabs with $20 donations !!! I really do love it here. my first time I got a 5 gram eighth, a couple fire joints & an invitation to their next party on Feb. 2nd which I’ll definitely be attending so i can get another 5g eighth, Can’t wait. If you want to try a new Compton cannabis dispensary, look no further. As you can see, they always got the deals.</Text>

I found this dispensary on weedmaps and I was greatly satisfied! I was looking for some cheap weed and got a great 20 cap! I got a fire gram and a gram of moonrock all for just 20!!! I also was impressed to see that they carry all my favorite vape products like stiiizy, plug n play and madres vape! I also sampled their gnarly cupcakes which were sooo good! I recommend them to everyone. They have happy hour 3 times a day where you can get a dab from their dab bar for just a DOLLAR! Sooo fire! They have a wide variety of prerolls & sourz edibles as well. They have it all! Thanks for all your help really appreciate it!! I will definitely be coming back to this shop. Check em out If your looking for cheap weed then you need to come check them out, the 20 cap Compton shop don’t have nothing compared to NWA 20 cap shelf. It smells and looks like it should be price higher. I always get high from everything I choose here and I also get the sourz edibles, my favorite so far is Stndrd gummies. They get you so high and you don’t crash at all. If your looking on weedmaps for a weed store that will have everything you need, this Compton dispensary will end up your everyday go to. Thank you Angie for hooking me up with some new edibles to try, I’ll be back tomorrow to let you guys know what I thought about them.<//review>

Nugz with attitude is my fav Compton cannabis dispensary yo!! They have a variety of products and the best customer service in the city. I was so happy to find plug n play & west coast cure carts here! They ALSO HAVE STIIIZY LIVE RESIN CARTS!! If you're looking to pick up any of the following, come on Thursdays because they give vape deals every Thursday. Sometimes I'll just come in to hit the dab bar or pick up a couple moonrock joints. Whatever it is I'm looking for, I come to this cannabis store for it cause they got it all! Thanks to Jules and all the girls here for their hospitality and warm energy!! Check them out people!<//Text>

If yu haven’t been to N.W.A you’re missing out. It has three leagues ahead of your traditional herbal dispenser. I highly recommend coming here before going to any of your regular shops. I promise you won’t be disappointed. And the girls are all very pretty that’s a win-win for me</Text>

Best dispensary in Compton, Angie helped me with some prerolls and moonrocks! They have live resin they hook you up with at the dab bar always stocked on their plug n play! My all time favorite is fire og. The best Compton dispensary near me!

I always come here and get hooked up forreal!! I love all the staff, especially Jules that’s my girl! Sometimes I just come for a dab because this is the only spot with a dab bar near me. I also come here for their buy 2 get 1 free on stiiizy , stndrd , sourz edibles and prerolls. They have cheap weed and supreme weed, whatever your heart desires!! I love coming on their patient appreciation days because it’s like a big party with freebies for everyone! This is the only Compton dispensary you need to go to. They have all the good cannabis products and the best customer service. If you bring a friend as a referral, you and your friend get a bomb deal. This place is great! I found them on weedmaps.<//Text>

I come here all the time. The customer service and the flower they have is amazing. I love the 4/20 party they have I already knew it was gonna be the best. What I really like about this shop is that they always have deals going on all the time anytime and the prices is for everyone. I always pick up the Marathon Og but they have some new stuff called Hardcore OG and it is fire. Chyna has been telling me about vapes for the longest and I’m definitely going to try it tomorrow for the buy one get one free you can’t go wrong with that. Keep up the good work ladies!<//review>

I found this Compton dispensary on weedmaps today so I decided to stop by because I was looking for stiiizy & stndrd products & I saw they carry them! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by all staff! That really stood out to me because you don’t get that kind of customer service at any other bud shop around here. Jules was great help during my visit today. She told me I’d really like Madres vape & plug n play since I like stiiizy. I’m going to get both my next visit for sure!!! She hooked me up with prerolls and I got a dab from their dab bar before I left. I had such a great experience here so this is going to be my number one shop now! Open late & they have everything you’d possibly need! 1 stop shop with awesome customer service and great deals too. Check them out!< /text>

<review>This is the best dispensary near me! I’ve been to a lot of bud shops in Compton but this one blows the rest out the water! Here’s why, the staff is more than helpful & polite, they always have a great deal running on their supreme weed, prerolls, stndrd gummies, moonrocks, stiiizy carts, wax & they got cheap weed!  They even have a nice selection of CBD here. 20 cap options are also available. It’s great because they have products for everyone. One stop shop!!! They have a dab bar running all day too, like whaaat!! The only spot I know with a functioning dab bar near me! I just wanted to say shout out to Jules for putting me on to the galaxy gummies. They are so good and taste just like sourz edibles. I found this spot on weedmaps. This is my new spot, I’ll never go anywhere else!<//review>< GmapID>

<Text>If your looking for Compton cannabis shop, Nwa is the best dispensary near me. They have the best brands in cartridges like madres vape, plug n play cart, stiiizy carts and stndrd carts. I can’t wait until they get the mooonrock carts too but I love how they have the color carts as a choice carts.  If your looking for cheap weed at a great quality then you have to come check out their 20 cap shelf. I’m always finding some fire bud there. It’s sticky and smells so good. You also get free prerolls with every purchase. And for only $5 you can add a sourz edibles to your bag. Definitely the best weedmaps near Compton. Thanks guys for always making me feel taking care of, cookie always hooks me up with all the deals they are promoting and I really appreciate you guys.<//Text>< pictures>

Coming to nwa is like walking in a weed wonderland, the shop is always clean and following CDC guild lines. The weed collection is huge and they have something for everyone. If your looking for cheap weed then you need to come check them out, the 20 cap Compton shop don’t have nothing compared to NWA 20 cap shelf. It smells and looks like it should be price higher. I always get high from everything I choose here and I also get the sourz edibles, my favorite so far is Stndrd gummies. They get you so high and you don’t crash at all. If your looking on weedmaps for a weed store that will have everything you need, this Compton dispensary will end up your everyday go to. Thank you Angie for hooking me up with some new edibles to try, I’ll be back tomorrow to let you guys know what I thought about them.< /Review>

This has got to be THE BEST dispensary in Compton, the budtenders are so welcoming and the flower is amazing. I also remember seeing them on WEEDMAPS which is great!
They also have AMAZING deals everyday.
my fav is the stizzy deal, buy two get one free! Like whaaaat?!?!! Birthday cake , purple punch and skywalker are my go to stiiizy pods.
They even do 5g for $20 all the way up to 5g for $75.
This shop is a must if your trying to get a bang for your buck or trying to find real quality!</Review>

I love Nugz with Attitude! The best dispensary near me and number 1 on weedmaps! They carry all my favorite products for vaping like madres vapes , golani , stiiizy carts , plug n play, just to name a few... You can get 10% off any vape on Thursday! I felt hooked up for sure! As for edibles, the best are the sourz edibles , galaxy edibles , stndrd gummies , gnarly cupcakes & they have more than that! Just ask the girls & they’ll show you their favorite! They always got something new. They got cheap weed, 20 caps , moonrock combo deals , all that. All the girls are friendly and offer the best customer service in Compton, hands down. They follow covid guidelines and always seem pleased to help you! Clean shop in general. Love it here. Bring a friend as a first time patient and you both will get a nice deal. They got prerolls for days and they offer a top shelf one for leaving a review. They’re the best in the city. Thanks again Jules for your help & knowledge! I'll definitely be back soon.</review>

I’ve been coming here for 6 months now, I love the concentrate they offer. They have great prices and run 50% off house wax twice a week. The service is always fun and inviting and I always leave feeling super hooked up on their freebies. Try the gnarly cupcake, it’s so good you won’t even know it’s a edible 👏🏽👏🏽. If your lookin for quality cheap weed, this shop has a large collection in bud and they clean your weed of stems and never put shake in your jar!! The prices start as low as $15 for a eighth to some super fire at $60 eighth. They run great deals on bud like 9 gram quarter for ftp and referral! Ask your budtender how to make your sale a combo by adding moonrocks or sourz edibles for $5 or $10 bucks when you get any eighth. I swear this the best cannabis dispensary near me. I looked them up on weedmaps and their google maps account came up. When I saw they carried Stndrd carts and Stndrd gummies, I had to come check them out and I’m glad I did because now I come 3-5 times a week. I’m getting free top shelf prerolls just for letting you guys know how great they are. Definitely a good dispensary near me open from 8am- 12 midnight daily!!!<//Text>

<text>Nugz with Attitude is the best shop in Compton and weedmaps!
They got fire on every shelf. Whatever you’re looking for! 20 caps, CBD, stndrd gummies, moonrocks and more. If you’re a first time patient or referring a friend, you’ll receive a 9gram quarter! Bomb deal! All the girls are sweet and genuinely interested in helping you find what’s best for your needs. Best customer service I’ve ever received at a cannabis dispensary. They follow Covid guidelines and the shop is very clean. They’re having Black Friday specials so I’m definitely coming back!

Good affordable pricing and their highest shelf is worth the price. One puff and you're faded. Hands down the best weed in town. Plus the staff I'd super dope, always having deals no matter what day you come thru. vibes are off too, love coming here for all my weed necessities, edibles selection is great..from drinks to tinctures to cookies..all kinds of goodies. Thank you Gio for the great experience today !! Ask for him if you want the best !!</Review>

<text>I Always come to nwa to see my favorite budtender maxi. She really takes her time and listens to what I really want. I can trust I’ll be satisfied with what maxi suggest. Nwa has the best quality in this neighborhood in Compton. The shop is always clean and everyone is friendly here. They follow COVID-19 stop the spread guild lines by always having gloves on and not letting guests in without mask. I get a 4 gram eighth anytime I come in with my student discount. And I leave high on a free dab of their house wax. Maxi always reminds me to get a half gram of crumble to add to my weed. It’s 50% off when you get a eighth. I told maxi they need to get their menu on weedmaps so we know what’s in shop before coming in. But ask for maxi for the best customer service and deals. All the girls are great here so I’ll definitely suggest coming to see what they have</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1606337008048, 'text': 'Thank You for your feedback.

Best dispensary in Compton, max hooked me up with 20% off. She told me I can get the first time patient deal for 5 gram 8th on Wednesday. Check them on weed maps for the menu. The stiiizy are Bogota at 10 at the patient appreciation day. They also have great sourz gummies. Stndrd gummies are the best here<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Love this dispensary, thanks weedmaps! Best in Compton for sure. When I came in I was politely greeted by everyone and I was pleased to see they follow COVID guidelines. I came to pick up a stiiizy birthday cake cart and got a bomb deal. Buy 2 get 1 free! I also found out they have my favorite stndrd edibles so I had to get some too. I love that they have 15 dollar eighths and great 20 dub deals. Thanks Jules for explaining the daily deals and when is best to come for what I need. You can find parking right in front or turn on cookacre, there’s parking there too. If you bring a first time patient with you, the both of you will get a 5gram 8th. I will definitely be coming back for their patient appreciation day on November 18th. Looking forward to it!

As soon as I came in we were kindly welcomed by the girls and they explained the deal I got for my first time. The customer service at this shop in unmatched, especially in Compton. Everyone was wearing a mask and gloves. I got a nice deal on high quality bud, you can't beat that. They carry a wide variety of products from CBD to liquid edibles. I suggest everyone to check them out. You won't regret it!! My favorite cannabis dispensary off top!! I'll be back on the 5th of August for the party they are throwing. Shout out to the staff here they are amazing!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Today was my first time at nwa and I got the ftp deal for 15% off my birthday cake stiiizy Pod. The budtender was kind and knowledgeable and told me I can get a 5 gram eighth tomorrow for their patients appreciation party. The shop was  clean and everyone was friendly there. My budtender hooked me up with a nice goodie bag for free and I got some fire sourz gummies to sample. They even have free dabs with $20 donations so I left super faded. I’ll definitely recommend this dispensary as the best in Compton. Thanks for the great product, service and price. I’m so glad I found you guys on Weedmaps 5/5 stars ⭐️</Text>

Came in today and was served by Blue who was super friendly and hooked it up with the daily deal which was a 6 gram special! I ended getting a gram of moonrock and ended up checking their 20 cap shelf and got the pennywise strain. Ill definitely refer friends and family to get my first time patient deal again!< /Review>

I came in to just pick up an eighth but after I smelled the Supreme OG I had to take buy the half. I haven’t seen this type quality bud in Compton anywhere else. I also purchased two of their sourz gummies & they gave me a free one! They also have some good 20cap deals. They got it all, I got hooked up with a really good deal so I walked out a happy man.</Review>

Great cannabis dispensary shop! They have a wide selection of cannabis strains, and delicious edible and vape products. I come here for the SOUR GUMMIES & STIIIZY PODS all the time! They never run out and bud tenders are super sweet. Highly recommend. They wear masks and gloves with hand sanitizer readily available. Thank you Nugz with attitude!</Text>

Best cannabis dispensary in Compton!!! They got my favorite cannabis juice, stndrd gummies & cool 20 caps when I’m looking for something good & quick. They always have stiiizy here b2g1, stiiizy birthday cake is the best. They have a party twice a month where they give a lot of freebies & 5g 8ths on Supreme OG. Best strain ever.
Check them out!!!<//Text>

<Review>max help me out over the phone by placing 7 grams of pennywise OG to the side for pick up. when i arrived, recep was very friendly and invited me to a smoke out on aug 19 with free snacks and edibles. When i got in the med room all the ladies made me feel welcome by greeting me all together. max told me i could bypass the line since i had a order on hold with her. i ask about vaping and she said stiiizy was the way to go. i told her i wanted to try it for work since i cant smoke blunts there and i heard vaping could help keep me high without any one knowing. she said vapes was know for its descret smell and instant high. she offer me a HYBRID call birthday Cake and i got 5 off my battery pack as a combo deal. ill definitely suggest checking this place out. if your tired of butender treating you like you need them then you need to come here and get the customer service you deserve when picking up weed!!!🙏🏽🧡 this shop also follow the guidelines to staying covid free😷< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Customer service was okay but it was my first time going here, to start off I didn’t get a first time patient deal as many shops offer. Bought a gram of wax and it was not good, it had a very horrible taste.</review>

Great dispensary to stop by when in Compton. They got good deals everyday and the new budtender Gio is super knowledgeable in CBD if you got question and will always give you the best weed in the shop when he helps you. The vibes is always good when you walk in, weed is fire always. great selection of vapes and edibles. Thanks again Gio !< /text>

It is my first time in this shop and inside looks awesome. Its so clean and pretty. Jaz and Erika helped me out and they are beautiful and knowledgeable. They told me about a party on Wednesday that i will be coming to. I got a 8th of pennywise og for only $15 and jaz gave me 5 grams!! Erika told me about a 5 dollar upgrade on some crumble to add to my blunt and im excited to try this. Thanks for the free top shelf joint guys, ill definitely be back.< /Text>

I come to nwa all the time. The 710 concentrate available is the best and they have the best deals in Compton. i can pick up my cannabis juice and sourz edibles all at the same place also. They have a huge selection in edibles here with bulk and combo deals to drop the price. If you are a vaper then you have to ask them about the buy two get one free deal on stiiizy. I always ask for stiiizy birthday Cake, its my favorite strain and i suggest you try it out. Ask for maxi,  she hooks it up always!!!< /Review>

< Review>
I come here all the time for just flower usually but Chyna had talked me into trying some fire  wax for the weed I had bought. What I really like what you can do is once you buy weed the price gets knocked down for the wax. This dispensary in compton never disappoints me ever they will make sure you will leave out of here with what you want. I can’t wait to see what’s up with the patient appreciation day coming up on the 16 they always got them poppin plus with the great deals. Go ahead and look at them on weed maps as well do you can see the amazing selection that they have from edibles to vapes they got it all!! Keep up the customer service ladies!! This was really the best 4/20 party ever thank you!!<//Review>

All these other compton shops might have good prices, but their weed is whack. I might have to spend a little more here, but at least i’m guaranteed the quality i’m paying for. BEST PRICES AROUND I PROMISE!< /Text>

I love Nugz with Attitude! I travel on the East side of Compton to come here. Its the best dispensary in Compton. They actually care for their patients. With daily deals , PADS, customer service, and quality bud. Never I'll go anywhere else. & shoutout to nelly for being patient with me today and helping me choose the flower bud & deals.<//Text>

Nelly was super helpful on today’s choices and best Sunday deal for me and my family celebration! The last time I was here was 4/20 & had major fun and most importantly the deals I got before going out of town! It’s the best dispensary in Compton and realizing that comin in today! They have some good 5G $20 eights for beginner starters but the best is the $50 cap recommendation! I’m not goin anywhere else. My new home shop no matter where I travel</text>
