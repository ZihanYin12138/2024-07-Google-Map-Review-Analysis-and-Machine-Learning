Our purchase experience with all the folks from Conejo was one of the finest we have experienced in a long time, they made the process simple and with no pressure......from our salesman Ray to Rick whom helped us customize our new RV to a small warranty repair with Marcia.  I would not hesitate recommending them to friends and family. :)</Text>

<text>Buying an RV can be a nerve wrecking experience, but the guys at Conejo made us feel on safe grounds. No rush, no pressure, but all honesty and transparency. We where mostly dealing with Jim, and he really took his time to help us through the whole process, both before the sale, but certainly also after. That's what really counts. We got ourselves a really nice RV that we will be enjoying for years to come.<//text>< pictures>

This is a professional and courteous operation.  ALL the staff were refreshingly helpful.  Sometimes I wondered who my salesperson was because they were all so terrific.  Rick performed on every promise and guarantee.   They were all knowledgeable and made every effort to answer my questions (no matter how trivial).  The crew worked hard to get the Rv ready for inspection before our warranty issued.  Even our independent inspector was impressed by the quality of our coach and its cleanliness.  Between Sergio's thorough inspection and maintenance and Kirk's representation on our behalf, our coach passed the first time with flying colors. We have bought many RVs over the last 15 years.  By far, our best experience.  Highly recommend.  We live in Oregon but this dealership was worth the trip.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>We just purchased a class A motorhome from ConejoRV and had an exceptional experience. This was our first motorhome buy so we did as much research on various dealers as we did on the motorhome itself.  We discovered that there are dealers to avoid while most are honest and reliable, however, we found through reputation and personal experience that ConejoRV is not only among the very best in California, but in all the West. We are from Oregon and it was well worth our while to buy from ConejoRV and hope to be a repeat buyer again one day. A few things we learned to look for in a dealer that sells pre-owned motorhomes; buy from a dealer that also sells new coaches from strong brands (this indicates they are reliable and financially well-established), buy from a dealer that has been in business a long time (ConejoRV has been around for over two decades), look for a dealer that has positive reviews from past customers (wherever we find dealer reviews, ConejoRV is always rated very highly), and ask other dealers their opinion (reputable dealers in our state had only positive things to say about ConejoRV).  We also found that practically all the inventory at ConejoRV is in terrific shape and they do a lot of work to make sure the coaches they sell are in great condition and ready to be enjoyed by the buyer.  The warranty they provide on pre-owned coaches also speaks volumes about how they operate and the confidence they have in their process.  We found that ConejoRV also has a strong team culture among its sales and service staff. Everyone we met was helpful and always attentive. And finally, when we bought our coach, we encountered an unexpected mishap and ConejoRV came through for us in spades and made sure we were well taken care of.  We feel very fortunate to have bought our coach  from ConejoRV, which proved itself to be an excellent dealer and overall exceptional business to buy from.

We had a rocky start with one salesman here but they worked quickly to regain our business. Our coach was beautiful and delivered as promised. They took time to walk through every inch with us and explain features. Kirk and Rick were excellent to work with and when we did have a small mechanical problem in our first trip out, it was immediately addresses upon our return. Very happy with our experience and would highly recommend them to anyone searching new or used!</Text>

We appreciated the way we were treated from the beginning. We had done our research and had some deeper questions. Kirk was professional, patient in answering our questions, very helpful in assisting us to make wise choices, and giving us information we didn't even know we needed. We have already recommended Conejo to others as they gave us the very best deal (we looked at every place between San Francisco and San Diego, plus Iowa and Texas!). We have also made follow-up calls afterwards and gotten timely and satisfactory answers. THANK YOU! for a great experience.<//Text>

He took the time to research what grate was correct for my oven, ordered it, and had it shipped to my home. I had the grate on Aug. 8th. Your company has been very good about the sale, transaction and any problems. Good customer service seems to be a thing of the past, but not with Conejo Wholesale. I also made Kirk aware of a few minor problems with the unit. Kirk said these items are not a problem and would be covered. I just wanted to say my experience with Conejo has so far been a very good one.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Very happy with my purchase at Conejo RV.  The rig I bought was exactly as described by the salesman, and I feel like they made every effort to make me happy.  The only suggestion I would have is that a longer warranty would be nice; The 45 day / 1,000 mile warranty ran out before I even made it back home, but I *did* travel 3,200 miles round trip to pick up my Fleetwood Jamboree :)<//Review>

Thank you so much for a great experience in buying our home on wheels! The minute we walked on your lot and were NOT followed around, we knew this would be a good place to buy our motor home. When we needed to ask questions, Jim was there. Noel walked us through everything when we picked it up.

We had a few learning curve problems and the staff was there for us.

Thank you so much for being an outstanding facility. Of course, we will recommend you to anyone and everyone!</Text>

You guys are great, always willing to help and go the extra mile. The only request I have is follow-up has been lacking. I have had to call back on a few occasions. I will be buying more from you!</review>

<review>We purchased our Navion from Conejo in May, after searching many east coast dealers we found by far the best price best deal at Conejo !  - starting with our salesperson ,Ray , we had a great experience with this company- we flew in from N.H. to find everything prepared and in order.  -everyone has had the "dealership" bad experience but this is not the case at Conejo, feel like we met the entire staff who were all friendly ,optimistic, and above all -helpful !  all our calls with questions after the purchase were promptly answered, help was always available when a couple of minor problems popped up. - do not hesitate to fly in from anywhere in the U.S. to buy your RV from these folks !  - totally satisfied customer , thanks guys !</review>< pictures>

<review>Dear Awesome ConejoRV Family,
My wife and I would love to share our experience with this amazing company (ConejoRV). We like to thank all your customers that gave you 100% positive comments. Your past customer reviews are the only reason what made us drive the 200-mile round trip.

Everything you read about (ConejoRV) is absolutely true and more. We were interested in this low mileage 2017 Fleetwood. When we did the initial walk through, we saw minor things would have been nice to get it fixed. When we said we like to buy this unit, this amazing company did their own extreme inspection. One week later sent us an email with a list of things they will fix that we didn’t see during our first visit. Not only did they fix what we didn’t notice, they actually replaced big ticket items such as awnings, TV Etc. We were anxious, while 90% of the RV was getting completed, we wanted to get the RV orientation done. We ended-up getting the most amazing orientation that lasted several hours. We are new to RV life, orientation was conducted in a manner people like us were able to comprehend.

We trusted them so much before getting the rest of the items fixed, we wrote a check immediately for $125,000 and ask them to keep the unit knowing 150% certain they will fix the rest. We wanted to buy our own insurance and the extended warranty from outside. In the end, everything (ConejoRV) recommended (insurance and the extended warranty) ended-up costing us less and better than what we would have paid. When we were about to leave, (ConejoRV) gave us 1-year membership to Thousand Trails. We are going to use that membership to stay for free at Thousand Trails RV sites this year.

We are so glad we didn’t buy a RV from an individual owner or a BIG RV dealership. We would have never received this level of peace of mind or the service. ConejoRV is all about customer retention, on top of what they fixed, they give you a 45-day onsite warranty. We believe the reason why they are the way they are, owner believes in staff working for a salary, not commission. This small team is friendly, honest and care about ConejoRV reputation. We got to know most of the staff, every one of them were absolutely great. They should be in business forever.

Faith and Subash< /review></record>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>We want to express our delight for the amazing customer service provided to us by Ray Clausing of Conejo Wholesale Auto & RV. This last week my wife and I stopped in at their Thousand Oaks location, hoping to determine how best to sell or replace our Ford F250 Super Cab and accompanying 2000 Layton M-2555 Fifth Wheeel. Conejo Wholesale was not in the market to simply purchase, but that did not stop Ray from taking an extraordinary amount of time helping us to determine the value of our equipment. Ray checked our the condition of our truck, providing us with estimates on what we might expect from either a trade-in or perhaps a third party resale. And then he researched the value of our Fifth Wheel, itemizing each and every accessory and enhancement, again providing us wit ha written estimate of what we might expect from a trade-in, or resale.
It goes without saying that the time taken and the detail provided were greatly appreciated and certainly above and beyond what we would have ever expected.< /Review></record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>My wife and I purchased a 2008 Forest River Georgetown 374 in May 2016.  We both fully recommend Conejo RV to anyone looking for an RV.  Rick is an honest owner and stands by his word!!  Rick, Jim, Ray, Kirt, Sergio and Nathan bent over backwards to do everything to get us the RV we were looking for, and to make sure our RV was in top condition when driving it off the lot.  Since taking it home we have had no problems.  Rick and the fellas have all lived up to their word in responding quickly to any questions any time we've asked.   In 3 weeks we have put 1,600 miles on our RV without any problems.  Canejo RV is all about customer service, and that something very rare these days.</text>< gmap_id>

We received nothing but lies. Thankfully we ran across you, Rick. You all displayed honesty, courtesy and your willingness to assist in helping find a coach of our liking. Perhaps other dealers should take notice. The coach you sold us is working out wonderfully needless to say. Most importantly the service Conejo Wholesale RV provided, was as promised, one would even say above ones expectations. You stepped up without hesitation to satisfy a customer. You can bet I'll be back to purchase my next RV from you.<//Text>< Pictures>

I’ve been around the block, having purchased dozens of vehicles in my life including 4 RVs.  Even though the guys at Conejo were very nice, I was still cautious having never purchased anything from them before.  The RV we selected was a 2002 National Tradewinds Class A Diesel pusher, and since National went out of business a few years ago I felt that I had to be extra cautious; but the price seemed fair, and Rick, Jim and Glen bent over backwards to set me at ease, and help me work out the financing.  I took delivery, and right away went on a week-long road trip to Zion National Park in Utah with my wife and 3 kids.  When the generator began to give us a bit of trouble my first thought was “Aha!  I knew it was too good to be true.”  But sure enough, after the trip Conejo invited me back and quickly repaired the small issue.  Since then we have gone to Portland, Seattle, San Diego, Joshua Tree, Las Vegas, New Mexico, and countless weekend trips to local spots, and I can confidently say that Conejo RV sold me a truly wonderful vehicle.  Not only was it spotless and well maintained, but over and over again the guys at Conejo proved their honesty and integrity with every follow up communication that I had after the deal was done.  In the months after my purchase I checked prices for the same RV online, and the price Conejo gave me was more than just fair –in fact, I am confident that today I could probably sell my RV for more than what I paid for it despite having put over 5,000 new miles on it.  Conejo RV sold me the perfect vehicle for our needs, in great condition, for a great price and stood behind it with great friendship and support, and for this reason I will never purchase an RV anywhere else again.</text>

<review>We flew from Montana down to LA in the Fall to purchase a class A we saw on your site. It is a 2006 King of The Road Genesis 43 footer. Just wanted you to know that we really couldn't be much happier. The deal was great, the motor home is great, and if we ever wear it out, we'll certainly look you up again!!  I have to tell you though, as first time buyers, we learned a lot! I have gone thru the entire thing, rebuilding the aqua hot, (it froze - my fault), and simply tinkering with EVERY gadget it has and tightening up all the screws, nuts, and bolts, even removing some windows and having the RV Fog Dr. clean them up. It ALL has been a great experience and I'm glad we bought it from you!!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80e83ab9feda4037:0xd2dc1c690db585c0< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I was in the market for a well maintained quality pre-owned diesel pusher. After dealing with the "run of the mill" high pressure cat and mouse games they like to play over at the larger RV chain stores, I fortunately stumbled upon Canejo RV in Thousand Oaks. What a difference! From the moment I stepped onto the dealership property, I felt completely relaxed, unpressured and welcomed. Rick, Ray and Sergio made my RV purchase enjoyable & completely hassle free. I'm quite sure I will be coming back again in the future.< /Review>< Pictures>

Last month my husband and I purchased a pre owned 2001 Class A motor home from your dealership and were very impressed by the professionalism of your staff and the overall service we received. When we initially looked at the motor home, we found it to be in excellent condition and very clean. Jim Derengowski showed us around, but we never felt pressured or hurried. Upon making our decision to purchase the RB, Mr Derengowski handled the initial paperwork in a thorough and courteous manner. Another staff member spent more than an hour taking us through the motor home and explaining how things work when we went to pick it up. Instead of a stressful experience, this was a pleasant one and we would not hesitate to recommend your company to our friends. If we ever need a replacement vehicle, we would go no further than Conejo Wholesale Auto and RV<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We were in the market for purchasing a motor home. I was in charge of all the research and type of RV we were going to purchase. We looked around the Los Angeles and Ventura county areas for used, well maintained and fair priced RV's. We saw many RV's, talked to ALL types of salesman and came up with a few to decide on. My husband recently met Rick and Kirk at a camping function and they mentioned that they were affiliated with Conejo RV. My husband suggested we go by and see and glad we did!

We were impressed with the low key, no nonsense, no haggle (because their price's are very competitive right from the start) and overboard on customer service. We are very happy with our purchase and very satisfied with their "We Care" customer service.

Be sure to look around compare prices and customer service when making a purchase and make your last stop at Conejo RV before making your decision. "Happy Camper, Happy Life" :)))))<//Review>< pics>

<Text>We purchased a well taken care of preowned class A motorhome from Conejo RV Sales. Upon taking delivery I had a few questions. Nate in the service dept was awesome about informing me of anything he could immediately, while researching and responding very quickly to anything he didn't know for sure. He was very thorough and made sure I was given the correct information. We took a couple short weekend trips right away without issue. Unfortunately, one month after delivery it happened...
We had family members fly 1600 miles to road trip from Las Vegas to LA. We had several concerts planned and a space reserved at Dockweiler RV park in Playa Del Rey, CA. Just before departing Vegas I noticed a small puddle of fuel at the back of the coach. I called and spoke with Jim, who had contacted Rick, the owner, and from my description of the issue, decdied it was something to do with the fuel line to the generator. I was advised NOT to run the generator and to bring it in for service the first opportunity possible. We drove to LA without running the generator only to discover we still were leaking fuel. I called Jim again and he didn't hesitate to give me Rick's number directly. The OWNER of the company gladly took my call, on a Sunday evening, his only day off, discussed with me the issue and determined I needed a new fuel pump. He told me to have it towed to the shop when our vacation was over and he'd take care of the problem. Monday morning the fuel pump was ordered and expedited to the shop. Wednesday, when I was able to get towed, they had the bay and mechanics ready and waiting for me as I had to try to make it back to Vegas to get to work that night. They pulled me right in and immediately started fixing my coach. Joseph busted his butt without stopping until the fuel pump and the fuel line to the generator were replaced (Rick was correct in his over the phone assessment). I had mentioned a couple other small issues when I arrived and to my surprise, Rick was out there fixing stuff himself. They had me back on the road in 5 HOURS and didn't charge me a dime!!! From the very first call to the completion of the repair, these guys maintained constant contact (via phone calls and texts) and helped to diffuse an already very stressful situation. I cannot say enough good things about this company and it's entire staff. When we upgrade to a diesel, we will DEFINITELY be returning to Conejo. They have earned themselves a customer for life.<//Text><user_name>Nathan Roodell</user_name></record>

<rating>5</rating><review>We ordered food for our whole office and it was a hit. The veggies, shrimp and meat were all very fresh. Good selection for picky eaters and adventurous eaters too. The Pad Thai lunch special was a generous portion and it came with a lot of white, brown or fried rice. The spring rolls were tasty. The sauces and dressings were just the right amount of spicy. Thank you for a delicious meal!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjMHzI6dxbGdWy0bcOO4bepaqLrCuuWWM8TowV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwhKtYPiEBqmC7mlaPC9mTL79MlGCLcCMpJa-u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

Thai Spirit has been my favorite Thai restaurant for years and years. The food is very strongly flavored, and all my favorite dishes (drunken noodle aka spicy basil noodle, green curry, pineapple curry, chicken satay, coconut soup) they make better than anywhere else.  When I eat Thai food elsewhere, it often tastes a bit watered down, the flavors are just not quite as bold (and I don't mean spicy, even when I have to order non-spicy to share with someone who can't do spicy, their flavors are still so strong).  And the recipes they're using are just so so good, they're the same dishes you recognize, but it's like they've really perfected them, getting all the flavors balanced just right (savory, sweet, umami, etc, all there).  There's just no better Thai food, and I'm so glad I'm lucky enough to live so close!<//Text>

Really great and authentic Thai taste. I ordered a small wonton soup as an appetizer, chicken pad thai, and spicy beef pad see ew. The wonton soup broth was very light and tasty, and there was plenty of veggies and chicken. The only let down was that there were 4 wontons, and they were on the small side. The pad thai was great, and better tasting than any other place in the Eagle Rock area. The pad see was also tasty and was a generous serving. Their thai tea tastes super fresh and just the perfect combo of tea and cream.< /Text>

Not a lot of parking but the food is good. I have never been disappointed when eating here. I think it's better to eat here than takeout, just because of the time in transition and then enjoying it, when you can dine at the restaurant and enjoy the atmosphere.</review>

Thai Spirit is wonderful -- I came here in the mid-afternoon while my car was being serviced next door. Ordered the vegetable spring rolls for an appetizer - I think it was 12 pieces, good for sharing. Then I had the yellow curry with chicken. I normally get noodles at Thai places, but was feeling like something different today, and the curry was the right choice. Delicious!< /Text>

We love Thai spirit. Their Thai tea is the best in LA that we've tried and we've tried a lot all over. They have a great mild flavored yellow curry and a delicious peanut dressing for the garden salad.  Highly recommend.</Text>

Restaurant is very cozy and nice. Food is amazing! Their soups are very delicious, especially the broths. We ordered beef and broccoli and the broccoli was cooked to perfection and fresh. Their fried rice is great too! Overall their food is as fresh as it can get! Great quality food and their prices are reasonable.</Review>

Order was an hour and a half late.

Shrimp Cake: Mostly Egg with an essence of Shrimp.

Pad See Ew: It was alright, too much broccoli.

Teriyaki Beef: Way too dry, too much cabbage and broccoli.

Now, broccoli is fantastic but not worth $10 bucks in a Styrofoam plate.<//review>

<Text>The food is pretty good. I've had their roast duck in the ginger gravy sauce and it was delish, a little sweeter than I'd like for my tastes but overall it was very satisfying.

However, like another reviewer has commented on, the service while polite and friendly IS slow so expect a good wait. Even if the place is practically empty or not busy. I would follow their advice and order ahead of time by 30 min, it actually takes almost that long anyways for the food to arrive so it's a good idea.</Text><response>None</response></record>

When I got there in person and asked about my order she said I cancelled my order earlier so she didn't put it through.only one star because I used to like coming here.</text>< Pictures>

WORST yellow curry I've ever had. Watered down and smelled fishy, like they put too much fish sauce in it. BBQ chicken smelled off, like they cooked it without seasoning. Refused to give me a full refund. Delivery speed was adequate. I will never order from here again.<//text>

Monarch Park is fun! Has a nice big field to play on. The playground has some corky activities unlike your average playground. I love the benches provided at the park. GREAT FOR PICNICING!</review>

<Time>1477949156143</Time><rating>4< /rating><review>This is our cricket Haven in San ramon, can't ask for more with its 360 Deg orientation with a proper arrangement for putting a mat pitch. Only concern is the grass which is more than what is required for a subtle playing condition. Overall it's a very nice ground for cricket and being a lefty batsman the fence provides the boundary on the leg side.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Cute little pet store in the heart of Los Angeles. Located right on Spring Street next to Spring for Coffee you'll find this pet shop that is tiny, but has just what you need. Pee pads, treats,  food, leashes, toys... you name it. Oh & they also special order food for you assuming they don't have it in the store.The staff is awesome and prices are reasonable.< /text>

<text>C & L has been around since the tumultuous 80's. They have always been the place to go in WeHo and Silverlake.
Always a clean store with friendly customer service dudes. Very well stocked shelves with a vast variety of whatever it is you need for your best friends.
Their price point is a bit on the + side but the locations and product availability is always on-point.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>The absolutely most affordable place to buy bird seed. I was a regular here to buy seed each week for my African Grey. This is the only local spot I found where I could pour seed into my own container and pay by weight, instead of buying a bunch of meely bags half full of live moths. Their seed is always fresh and at the best price anywhere.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c735f413d733:0xc7614cbbe10d0696<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>We rescued a dog two years ago, and after going to PetCo.etc, this store was recommended to us by a dog park regular. Now, we go here regularly for wet and dry dog food, and treats. Nice, helpful people, the right price (very important), and great location - esp if you live in Silver Lake and don't want to deal with traffic...it's ideal. Super convenient and we like patronizing a local business.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<text>I initially went because I was looking for a fish, whereupon I learned that they don't carry animals anymore (granted, I haven't been to the store in something like 6 or 7 years...). Otherwise the place was very well stocked and the staff were attentive.</text>< pics>

The store itself feels a little cramped around the sides and at the top of the stairs, but they have so much packed into there that you'll find what you need. The staff is nice, and they oftentimes know their stuff, more than enough to help me over the years. The parking lot they have is small, but most people walk here anyway because of the short distance.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Aweful customer service. The attendant could not have been less helpful. When it came to pay she had no clue how to use the credit card machine. Go elsewhere</Review>

This store had a lot of conflicting reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. After two visits, I intend to continue shopping here.

While Collar & Leash doesn't have the most abundant supply of toys, they carry a large variety of quality treats and food. I like to buy Zuke's brand treats for training my pup, and they are significantly cheaper here than Petco.

Service was very helpful and friendly, and I ended up talking to the cashier for awhile about dog food. He was knowledgeable and I really appreciated his advice. I have since switched my dog to a more wholesome brand they carry. Thank you!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>(Translated by Google) Very good and honest advice !!
In the end we decided against a purchase, but also because of the honest advice on the spot !! The shop offers a lot of choice and parking. Unfortunately, we had only very specific ideas to fulfill (brown is just not the same brown) and were looking at another place.
The service here even went so far that people called other dog shops to find the perfect brown collar for a dog !!
Very much thanks !!!

(Original)
Sehr gute und ehrliche Beratung!!
Wir haben uns zwar am Ende gegen einen Kauf entschieden, aber auch aufgrund der ehrlichen Beratung vor Ort!! Der Laden bietet sehr viel Auswahl und einen Parkplatz. Wir hatten nur leider sehr spezifische Vorstellungen zu erfüllen (braun ist eben nicht gleich braun) und wurden an einem anderen Ort fündig.
Der Service hier ging sogar so weit, dass in anderen Hundeläden angerufen wurde, damit wir das perfekte braune Halsband für einen Hund finden!!
Ganz ganz lieben Dank!!!< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Chef Andrei at 15C catered my micro wedding event, and the food was absolutely stunning and delicious! We are so grateful for this last minute addition to our wedding as we originally were not able to afford catering, but he was very reasonable with his pricing and the food was well worth the cost! He surpassed our expectations! We are so happy we booked 15C for our event! The food looked amazing and tasted even better than it looked!<//review>

Some of the most down to earth and charismatic staff and local customers that I’ve experienced at a restaurant! We just had beers to pass the time but I’m really looking forward to coming back here on a date with some lucky lady. Be sure to try the Margarita Pizza (no special requests. Get the chef’s original recipe) and say hi to the “man of the year” aka The Mayor.

Cheers!

My go-to spot for years! It feels like CHEERS because I know everyone there and they know me! I love this place so much that I moved all my banking to Umpqua right next door.  My banking days always include a glass of wine with Chef Nathan! Best food and wine on the planet!</review>

I've always loved 15C but Chef Nathan has taken it to a new level! Amazing menu but with specials like "pizza of the week" or "burger of the month." I find now that I'm going once a week with my dog and had to give shout out. Great job15c!<//Text>

<Text>WE WERE THERE ON 02/15/2020 BECAUSE WE HEARD IT WAS GOOD FOOD & WINE. FAST TRACK TO OUR OPINION, WINE SELECTION GREAT, FOOD HAS MUCH TO BE DESIRED. MY WIFE'S HAMBURGER WAS DRY & TASTELESS ($17.00), MY ARUGULA CHICKEN SALAD SUPER SMALL & MEDIOCRE AT BEST FOR TASTE ($20.00). OUR BOTTLE OF AUSTIN HOPE CABERNET 2017 WAS AWESOME, TO BAD THE REST OF THE SERVICE & MEAL WASN'T THE SAME.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Great selection of wine, friendly staff, extremely well educated owner. If you want an experience that takes your wine needs to the next level on the central coast of California this stop is a must for anyone visiting Templeton or nearby wineries. Come with an appetite as well, the food and cheese selection is unbelievable and memorable. Can't wait to go back!<//text><Date>1552610320180< /Date>< Pics>

According to CDPH guidance, masks are mandatory while preparing food for sale, yet they are not complying with that mandate.
When asked why, they’re response was “we just don’t.” Establishments such as these do not care about public health.< /Text>

<Review>We sit down at the bar and look at the wine menu in the afternoon  only to be greeted
By a rude gentlemen by the name of Nathan telling us" food is no longer served".
I told him what makes you think we want food...It's the same small menu for food as is wine but he assumed we wanted his food lol.Unfortunately we stayed and ordered a glass of wine which was almost a portion of wine tasting.
Believe me they are making sure they aren't too generous to fill your glass more then the rules allow...but charge premium prices
Besides Nathan or Juniors Nathan's great hospitality and light pours the other staff Didn't seem to friendly or know what was going on .
There are plenty of other wine tasting rooms  to go that appreciate your business and are pleasant.
This isn't one of them.< /Review></record>

Love Ali and 15C. It's a great place, warm atmosphere, wonderful hospitality and delicious food and wine.  Everyone is always very nice in greeting us when we come in and when we reserve the patio for meetings, they are very attentive to our needs.  As  owner of Central Coast Party Helpers, I have a very watchful eye for service, they're top notch.< /review>

<Review>We were suprised at the chef's rude demeanor and considered leaving after his show of poor attitude. The rest of the servers were great, thankfully, and made up for the bad experience with the chef. Food is good, wine selection is great.

Great little wine shop. Lots of locally grown, bottled, and aged wines from all around Templeton, Paso Robles, and San Luis Obispo. Knowledgeable staff that is very friendly and willing to help you pick the right wine. Not too far from the freeway so you can easily pick up a bottle while passing by.<//review>

I used to love this place. But tonight we had horrible service. The bleached blone crazy lady serving us, who I swear was drunk or high. 1st told us not to come to the counter to.order. Then Refused to sell my husband speciality beers he brought to the Counter because he was not a beer club member.  Really.. where is this posted.. I guess this in a new policy because we have been these beers here for years...very sad...</Text>

I was literally in and out, it was really quick service. All the gentlemen in the shop were super friendly, and my car was readily parked for my exit once I paid. (VIP style. Haha)<//Review>

When everything was done I passed smog and then he showed me some tubing that could be replaced just to avoid future repair. Great experience!< /Review>< pictures>

I paid all the fees online, just needed the smog. I went in for smog inspection, failed the first time. $50 pass or failed. So I failed because of my  intake, went back home And put my factory intake back on. He said next time I would just pay $8 for the certificate.  Next day I went back And passed without any test or being on the ramp.  Went to the register he said if I wanted the tag right away its another $30 bucks. I told him I’ve already paid DMV, I should get it in the mail. He said are you sure? Ok..... then he said it’s $40 dollars for today. I’m like what!!! You’d told me yesterday it’s was no charge for rest eat. He changed his story which it did not make sense this time. So total I paid almost $100 for a smog. Long story short, I did not want to deal with this guy. I know it’s hard time, please don’t hassle your customers. You just lose me as a customer and hopefully more if you mistreat your customer. Stay away!!!!!</review>< Pictures>

I was a little reluctant to visit because pictures of business don’t make a good impression.  I called and the man who answered was friendly enough, so I decided to give it a go.  Wait time was short after arriving and smog test was complete in a timely manner.  Sean the mgr. is very nice and made a good impression.   I’m glad it went so well. Oh, and the price is right.  Returned after 2 years and happy to say the service is still great.
Came on a Saturday in fact and almost no wait.
Place is old and not much to look at, but when the people are friendly, price is lowest in town, and they get you in and out quickly, well who cares?<//review>

<Text>The best experience I have ever had getting a Smog! Sean made me coffee and another gentleman got my car and within 15 minutes I was done and out the door!! I will caLL TIS PLACE MY NEW Smog check home!!

Went back this morning and same treatment .. very nice and  fast service. I kinda wish they would have told me about the 26.75 price special instead of the 36.75 price plus 8.25 for cert. but it is what it is. My car is a 2008 Charger. but even then still worth it.. they are great!<//Text><user>111522280826112842799<//user>< name>

This is the first year that I have been required to get a smog for my car that I bought new in 2012. Since it's been a while I called several smog shops for prices and Express Smog beat the competition. You don't need an appointment, just stop by. This was the quickest smog I have ever had, it took LESS than 10 minutes. Paid $35 for the smog and certificate out the door. Call first to check the price or you might not get the discount. I highly recommend Express Smog.</text>

<Review>I take a several vehicles here a year. The guys who run the place are quick, knowledgeable, and friendly. There is an AutoZone next door to browse if you're bored and a Mexican restaurant nearby across the street if the are really busy. I've never had to wait more than 45min. when they were really busy.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Called this place in advance to see what the price would be for a 2006 Honda Civic and was quoted $35 ($26.75 inspection + $8.25 certificate). This place is not easy to miss visually as they have "Smog" signs all over, but make sure you drive into the side driveway going slightly downhill next to their garage instead of passing the place and parking in the parking lot that belongs to another shop. The other shop is Contreraz Smog and Repair and will cost you $45 for the same service.
The inspection was quick. Often when I would visit auto shops of any kind, I felt a bit disregarded when I asked mechanical questions. Here the owners welcomed my inquiries about what they were looking for and were really friendly. Probably the best customer service I got in a while. I am coming back in two years.<//Review>

<Text>I called ahead and the guy was very friendly and welcoming on the phone. Took my mustang to get smogged here. I was in and out! The guy was very accomodating when I was in the waiting room. I will be bringing my other car here as well! Highly reccomend this place. This smog shop is located next door to another smog shop. So be sure to put the address in your GPS. The smog shop has a white truck outside with a smog sign, so it is very easy to find. Thank you again!< /Text>< GmapID>

The guys are professional, quick and their service is very well priced. This is "the place" to go get in, get out, and get on when you need to complete the dreadful "Smog Certification" requirement for your DMV registration , BEST decision I've made. I plan on getting all my smog tests done there from here on out!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x8094675fc2c934a5:0xd1e064d54508af24</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Two different playground areas for smaller and bigger kids. My son really enjoyed both and especially the sand play area. The playgrounds are quite far apart so would be a challenge if you have two kids of different ages. Public restrooms available. Was very hot on our visit with very little shade.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2WAADJ4vM36S3kNrn9u7QvVpZ-nkUn_-suYvr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3B1pCKd_zmLX748fJKiZKf4Rj7Vjka58d1JyO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW0DE7UfImKYFxybt5UM-OY2c5LPsh8dvUCFwV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv-vgaP2ic7jLDIJSCCQrjafAYWd_gCjatl34y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMZWkuPQTg39CkloDc7Re_3n4GsTQSgv5JIPXF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONd2zO5HXK7zNOXjKEEVDlPi8Ohajig32X4kMC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

A large park, with two great kids play areas with lots of fun equipment (especially for middle aged kids). There are paved paths to walk or skate. There are four large baseball fields with impeccably manicured grass and great seats.

There is lots of parking spots all around the park.<//text>

We love Wilson park becuase there's 2 playgrounds. The smaller kids have an enclosed play area with sand. The older kids have a larger structure. Kids can bike around on the walkway and use the grass field to kick balls, play badminton or sun bathe. There's also baseball diamonds that the little league uses for their practice and games. In addition to the bathrooms which as accessbile, there's a ceramic art studio which has been closed during the pandemic. Lastly for dog lovers, Cupertino parks provides bags for everyone to pick up after their pets.<//review>

currently my favorite park in Cupertino since Creekside Park is full of soccer players (adults who smoke even though all Cupertino parks are supposed to be non-smoking), bicyclists (adults who think it's a velodrome even though they're violating vehicle laws by riding in the park on the side walk), teenagers and kids littering ... basically a lot of rude people at Creekside<//Review>

It's a fine park. Lots of grass and foliage as expected. Sometimes you may spot the rare group of teenagers memeing around and playing the piano badly.

Edit: Sometimes you may also see a masked elmo with hazardous candles lit around it as if summoning satan. Highly likely the same memeing teenagers. Probable cause of the next California fire you heard it here first.< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A leisurely park in a residential area. There are few playground equipment for young people, but a little different slide is fun. There are enough parking lots.

<review>(Translated by Google) One of my favorite places. Just standing there will make you feel refreshed. There aren't many shades to let kids play, but it's still a place I love so much that I want to come here again and again.
There is a fence in the area where small children play, so children can play safely.

(Original)
大好きな場所の一つ。そこに立つだけで心が洗われるような気持ちになります。子供を遊ばせるには日影が少ないけれど、それでも私はここに何度でも来たいと思うほどに大好きな場所です。

Was rather surprised to see the female wait staff dressed up in bra & panties/lingerie ensembles! But that aspect is a minor note in the overall attractiveness of this place. The female wait staff were super friendly, attentive and professional while serving me and my friend. The Vietnamese food offerings were great and the chrysanthemum ice tea they offered was simply delicious. Plus they regularly keep cleaning tables and keep their establishment quite tidy. This includes the restrooms as well. Sadly, I will need to dock this place a star due to a heavy smokers environment; despite them having "No smoking" signs, the regulars/head staff members behind the counter seem to ignore that. But since this place also has video gambling machines/various sports been played on their big screen TVs, it perpetuates a sports bar vibe which is fine I guess. I really enjoyed my time regardless. Will come and visit again!<//text>

<Text>It is a great place for Vietnamese coffee and food. The waitress was nice but they are not very talkative. The place also serves beer and not too crowded on the weekends at night. I sent on a Friday almost 10 PM. Great place for guys to hang out and watch sports.</Text><gmapID>0x808e32a35a3b0bf3:0x8db3a8150552ca97< /gmapID>< username>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I didn't understand what "Vietnamese coffee" meant.  I've had Single origin, French, Italian, pour over, etc however it turns out that "Vietnamese coffee" entails scantily clad presumably attractive women serving coffee and perhaps sitting and chatting.  This was unexpected and not a service I have any interest in, but I will do my best to review it in the spirit of it's intended role.

Environment has some cool water sculptures, several nice TVs, and I guess Keno/Mega touch machines. Coffee is mediocre at best (not worthwhile), service is slow (seemly very burdensome for the girls), girls look like they hate life  and despise the customers (which I can't begrudge them as people but it's clearly a terrible employment choice) - though they are in their underwear and would be generally regarded as quite attractive.  They can be the only reason anyone would ever come here.

My friend insisted that we go to three other "Vietnamese coffee" shops in the area that evening and this was far and away the best one which by my relative reviewing standards means this is at least a 4 though, otherwise, I'd rate it a 2 or 3.

However, I will return and try the food.  If they just had decent beer it'd be tolerable (Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier would be a good start).<//Text>< date>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>It was ók. Iced coffee good. The ladies are pretty. They hide them behind the cash box. But one girl is friendly and talkive. Service is ók. They need to walk around and chat more. Make us feel like me matter. Instead of calling them over

The Worst custumer service you can get at the store the lady behind the counter pliantly told me " if you don't like go shop somewhere else " you order parts with them and give them their lead time and it takes them twice the amount of time to get the parts and it takes for ever to get an answer over the phone. the store is a mess just a bad experience..</review>

I couldn’t have prayed for a better dentist!!! Everyone at this office is always helpful and the services they provide are the best I’ve ever had and they do such a good job that they should be charging double the amounts they charge but they always put their patients first and respect the fact that we don’t want to be charged a lot. And if you call the office and they have to put you on hold the hold music is actually entertaining and fun to listen too 😊. I will be referring all my family and friends over to Mesa Dental 🦷< /Text>

One thing that stood out to me when I was researching this place is that they claim: "we eliminate fear with one rule: love". I have had a couple thousand dollars worth of work done here in the past year and I can attest that all the staff, and especially Dr. Qadeer himself, really live up to that claim. I truly have felt loved and cared about. And my teeth are in great shape now too!<//text>

<Review>I went in because of the great Google reviews. I was extremely disappointed. All I needed done at the time being was my teeth cleaned and a replacement crown for a crown that had came off a week ago. It took them a total of five whole minutes for my teeth cleaning. I was rushed through, and barely talked to. Then they wanted to charge $3200 just for a new crown. That is triple the amount of any crown I’ve ever heard of anyone paying. The root canal was already done years ago, so it was that much for just for the crown. I rarely comment or post reviews, but I wanted to make all aware of this place. Shame on you guys.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate>< user>

{'time': 1623263927079, 'text': 'Dear Mr. Ford,\nWe are sorry to hear about your experience.  However, after reading your review I called you to clear the misunderstanding you had about the treatment plan.  Per our phone conversation, your entire co-pay is only $565 with your insurance, which is not the $3,200 UCR fee that you had mentioned in your review that is for three different types of restorations.\nFor your information, a UCR fee is an amount paid for a medical or dental service in a geographic area based on what providers in the area usually charge for the same or similar medical service without any insurance.  This is only listed on the treatment plan for your information. In fact, the $3200 is not for a single treatment, but is an accumulative cost for three different types of services.\nWe hope this better clarifies the misunderstanding we had and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.\nGod bless\nDr. Qadeer and Mesa Dental Team.'}<//response>

I am literally a horrible patient when it comes to dentistry. The entire staff at Mesa Dental has imeasureable patience. Dr. Qadeer has a fantastic personality. He is calm, understanding and goes out of his way to make me feel at ease.<//text>

<review>Was looking in getting my dental implants and my friend referred me to Mesa Dental as she had gotten 4 implants from them and she had nothing but wonderful things to say. Fast forward 6 months later and Dr. Qadeer did a wonderful job and my smile is back to new again. Friendly staff and Dr. Qadeer is a delight. Great chair manners and always making us laugh.<//review><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Glad to have found Mesa Dental and Dr. Qadeer. I have had dental phobia since I was young and was always afraid of going to the dentist. I am glad I was able to find them as Dr. Qadeer eased all my fears from the moment i met him. He was very understanding and patient with my needs and after completing all of the necessary work, i can say that my fears are gone. Thanks mesa dental.< /Text>

I wanted to like this place, based off the reviews and I did at first.  All the staff were nice, friendly and Dr. Qadeer was nice too.  However, once I reviewed the pricing for a crown which was way more expensive than my last one at a previous dentist, I called to inquire what a lava crown upgrade is and the lady told me it's the porcelain crown.  That's great and all but I want the standard porcelain crown.  Apparently they are both the same high price.  I contacted my insurance to dispute and even they agreed they were overcharging me and contacted Mesa Dental to tell them to give me the insurance rate.  I was supposed to get a call from them to discuss further, but at this point it's grounds for dismissal. You have to beware of cosmetic dental place because clearly they can charge you upgraded prices for fancier things you don't want. I will switch to another dentist that suits my needs.< /Review>

<Date>1619321735036<//Date><user>111887593854962618948<//user><Review>Let me just say I went to this dental office because I saw that he had mostly positive reviews. I went to the office to get an opinion from the doctor. Let me say, as we know , sadly in this country many dentists just like vets are trying to milking the cow. They are using fear in order to tax patients as much as possible. I went to this office hoping he will be different. He was not. I was straight forward with the dentist into the fact that I didn't want to be tax more. His answer was he does not care about money, he has plenty of money. He cared about his patients. Now comes the moment of my exam. He pretty much told me I needed an all in 4 implants which i kind of expected. He told me the cost would be 23K, I asked if he had any payment plan, any solution, he said I can do via their loan office they use but with almost 18% interest (a lot). I left, he never even follow up with me, contacted me, trying to find a solution. Basically, his behavior was if you can afford, let's do it, if not go find your solution, go pay some high interest and come back. Sir, if you cared that much about your patient, you would find a way to help them, find some payment plan where they wouldnt have to pay double the cost in interest. Hugg all dentists are just the same!!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_name>French Kalifornie</user_name><Rating>2< /Rating></record>

<review>I have been to many dental offices throughout my life and I must say, I have never had such a great experience as I did with Mesa dental. Right of the bat I knew Dr Arash knew his stuff! He didn’t BS around, he got to the point and  made sure I understood the procedure. Most dentists tell you what they want to do and it’s up to you to decode what their doing. This doctor calmly explained everything, leaving nothing unturned. I highly recommend Dr Arash.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Came to get invisalign as they had a nice special. From the moment i walked into the office, i knew i had found the place. Very friendly staff and Dr. Qadeer helped and explained everything in detail as to the next step. I am almost done with my Invisalign and couldn’t be happier with the results already.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

< Review>
Had been going to Dr Qadeer for a couple years and everything went really well until my last visit. I’ve had a lot of dental work and crowns over the years and one had recently came loose. Went to Dr Qadeer and he said we can try to re-cement it but if it comes loose again we’ll have to completely re-do the build-up and a new crown. Okay made sense. 3 weeks later same crown comes loose again. I didn’t have the money to pay for a whole new crown out of pocket so I figured I’d get it re-cemented again and wait a year or so until I can afford another crown. This time I decided to just go to TJ to have it re-cemented because it’s a simple job and much cheaper. The dentist down there pulled the loose crown off, inspected the tooth and determined everything was still fine (no cavitiy) and we can re-cement it. He then commented “we’ll use permanent cement this time. Whoever did it last time used temporary cement for some reason.” It seems as if Dr Qadeer used temporary cement knowing full well that the crown would come loose again in a couple weeks so then he could sell me on a new crown replacement. It’s now been several months later since the crown was re-attached using permanent cement and no issues.< /Review>

Set up for new patient appointment was so easy. I sent a few emails back and forth, with my insurance information, new patient forms, and they set me up with an appointment. No need to call if you don't have the time - they are very responsive via email, which made things super easy. When I arrived to my appointment, front desk ladies were very nice. I was called back by a woman (I wish I remembered her name, because she was extremely friendly) who took my xrays and eventually polished my teeth. Dr. Qadeer was patient, kind, and luckily informed me that I had zero work that needed to be done. After the exam, my teeth were polished and the hygienist Stephanie took care of me from there. In total, I think this is a great place, and they've hired some quality individuals. I can't wait to come back in 6 months.< /text>

<username>Alon Dagan<//username><Text>I know Dr Qadeer for over 15 years. I have followed him wherever he goes. It is hard to find a dentist that you can trust, one that presents facts and provide you options, one that doesn't force you to go through procedures if it's not needed and above all professional and friendly. I highly recommend Dr Qadeer. Looks like his clinic got busy over the years , which means that I'm right.</Text>< user>

Dr Qadeer is the absolute best! He listens and cares and does a thorough job with making sure your teeth are in tip top shape. Most of all....the entire facility has the friendliest people working there. It's so nice to walk in and be greeted with warmth and smiling faces. :)</review>

If you are looking for a kind, comfortable, professional and high quality dentist office this is it!! Dr. Qadeer  is amazing! Kind, professional, intelligent, and soooo nice. It's like he exudes a calming aura that just makes you feel better. All I can say is wow. I was concerned looking for a new dentist after moving from Boston but Mesa Dental made it easy to make an immediate appointment. I also had some concerns about my wisdom teeth that made me feel scared to have them looked at. Dr. Qadeer made all of my worries go away by thoroughly explaining my dental health. He also made sure I knew that he believed my pain & discomfort which was really important to me as a woman of color. He made me feel comfortable and confident by giving me a treatment plan for my gums and even gave me new tips on flossing. He even took the time to explain what the oral surgeon would do and how the oral surgeon would make a treatment plan for me.

The equipment for the cleaning was all high quality and new. Even the radiation guards  for x-rays were better than I have experienced and went all the way up to the neck. After my appointment a staff member explained in plain English Dr. Qadeer's treatment plan and how to follow up. I really really loved it here and am excited to be his new patient!</text>

<Review>Dr Qadeer and Jimmy are a dream team. I can't believe I actually look forward to going to the dentist to see them. Not only has he helped me for years with my very British teeth he also did my Invisalign for me. And look at the results!! I recommend him a thousands time over if you are looking for a great dentist. I would not write a review unless I meant every word. The picture speaks for itself. Thank you so so much Dr Qadeer!< /Review>< user_id>

<Text>I continue to be impressed with Dr. Qadeer and his entire staff.  They are efficient, yet pleasant and friendly.  Dr. Qadeer is, without parallel, a brilliant dentist.  He deeply cares about his patients.  I was a "dental chicken" when it came to dental work.  Dr. Qadeer calmly eased my fears and with his expertise in injecting the numbing agent, I no longer have pain in the dental chair.  I highly recommend this practice.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

As someone who has spent so much time in the dentist chair and has been horrified of dentist. Finding Mesa Dental was a blessing. I was so tired of have multiple crowns replaced because they weren’t putting the correct ones on. I was ready to have all my teeth pulled and go with total implants when I found Doctor Qadeer he said no way he would pull them that he could save all of them! He did just that 8 Zirconia crowns later and a filling along with a mouth guard I feel good again! All my crowns I came in with had bad cavities underneath most were less then 4 years old one had come off .
The entire staff is AMAZING from the receptionist to all of the people in the back behind the scenes, This office has the nicest and most educated dental assistances I have ever seen. They were wonderful about making me feel comfortable. I felt safe while they were working on me, something I’ve never felt in any other office and with all the work I had done I pretty much had all of them at one time or another!
But the most Amazing of all was Doctor Qadeer! He is so kind, gental, comforting always making me feel at ease never making me feel Anxious even though my blood pressure I know goes up like crazy when I walk into a dental office. He takes his time with me always doing a first Rate job! I will always be greatful to Mesa Dental for changing my life and giving me a reason to smile again😊. Thank you all.  Joan Marko</review>

<review>Changed from another dentist to this one, great experience, everyone was very friendly and I felt like the staff cared about the patients, last dentist I was at told me I needed an entire crown to fix a broken cavity filling on a molar and here the Doctor said it's a simple removal of the pieces and replacement!  Tell you what, removing and fixing the filling is way cheaper than a crown!<//review>< Pics>

Dr. Qadeer Is a blessing. He is not only amazing at his craft, but sincerely cares for his patients. I know that I am in the best hands possible at Mesa Dental, and that I am doing what’s best for having a healthy smile for years to come! Highly recommend.<//Text>

I have had the best experience at Mesa Dental. I have always had a huge fear of the dentist, until coming here. Everyone is incredibly friendly, caring and make you feel like your at home when coming in. They have helped me conquer my fears of needles and going to the dentist. I got veneers  about 8 years ago and I constantly get complements on how amazing my teeth look. People are always shocked when I tell them they are not my real teeth! I now send my husband, family members and any friends who are looking for a dentist.< /Text>

<user_name>Dominique Enciso< /user_name><review>Mesa Dental is easily the most welcoming, friendly, relaxed and professional dental office I've ever stepped foot in. From the front office staff, support staff, head dentist, and everyone else in between. Their professionalism and care make me feel like I am always in good hands. I have grown to trust them 100%. I also must add that they're super quick in making sure you're serviced in a timely manner, never waiting around too long also perfect for the families always on the move. I don't see myself having to switch anytime soon. I can't recommend this office enough.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86< /Gmap_id>< rate>

My Mesa Dental experience was great!  Dr. Qadeer and his staff were very friendly and down to earth.   The office is very relaxing and they play great 80's music while you wait.  My dental needs were very unique in that I needed to replace a failed front tooth with a dental implant.   This process took several months to complete but the result was very satisfying.  I have an awesome smile and I can now bite into an apple with no pain or discomfort.  If you haven't found a family dentist yet, please check out Dr. Qadeer office.  He will treat you like family.</Review>

Update: the dentist called me personally to better understand why the office did not get 5 stars. He had me come back in for a more detailed consultation to plan the treatment of my teeth. Way to go Mesa Dental! Stars updated to reflect their good customer service and care for quality.
Everyone was very nice. But, I made an appointment for an exam and cleaning and did not get a cleaning or explanation why not. I needed to speak with the dentist about my teeth and the plan to fix them but he was in such a hurry to move on that he developed his own without me and then left the room.  I need surgery and orthodontics in order to fix the severe overcrowding, but he didn't even take enough time looking at my teeth to see that. Then I am handed an estimate for over $6000. Nice does not equal quality. I am going to look to a dentist who will involve me in the plan to fix my teeth. Or at least stop talking long enough to hear what I expect the outcome to be similar to.</Text>

<Review>The staff at Mesa Dental are always very friendly! They do a great job. They were able to fit me in for a last minute appointment at the time that worked for me and I’m very thankful for that! 👍🏻

2/20/20 Update: I've been a patient at Mesa Dental for going on 5 years now. Dr. Qadeer is very friendly, makes you feel comfortable, and does a great job. The dental hygienists and front desk staff are also friendly and helpful. In my last visit, they gave me a very fair price for something that would have likely cost more somewhere else. I do believe they want to work with their patients, do what is best for them, and make sure that you return again. Many people I know have a lot of dental horror stories, and I'm glad that I cannot relate to them! Thank you Mesa Dental :)< /Review>< username>

The cleaning was a bit too fast. Didnt feel like they took the care and attention to do a really good job. I think they have a lot of patients and concerned about moving patients along as quickly as possible.

Update March 2020: Dr Kadeer ended up reaching out to me and offered a full cleaning at no cost. It was again a swift cleaning but the Dr was patient and clear to communicate that they use state of the art equipment and is actually more effective than older standard methods.  I guess I'm used to the old standard ways of my prior dentist. I appreciate that he took the time to explain and treat me with respect. I admit perhaps I was not the most informed customer and have to give them a lot of credit for taking those extra steps for me.</review>

This is the best dentist.. ever! I have had a number of issues with my porcelain crowns and they kept cracking. I came in and on our 2nd attempt with a porcelain crown, it cracked on impact because of bite strength. (& I’m a grinder) Right then and there, he offered me a new gold crown, free of charge, took outstanding care of not only my dental health, but they treated my 1 year old like family whenever she came in 🙏 & my little girl can definitely be a lot to handle when mommy’s in the dentist office for an hour plus! They were considerate, passionate, took care of ALL my needs, and made me feel more than welcome. I recommend this office to anyone even if it’s in San Diego! I live in LA and I still made the drive to only come here! I never had any regrets, and neither will you!!!! 🙏 thank you! Thank you!< /review>

The staff is so friendly! Always kind and caring. I always have a great experience when I visit for my appointments.

Typically going to the dentist is no fun. Needles, drilling and accidentally biting your tongue and not feeling it til after the numbing goes away when you’re just trying to enjoy a carne asada burrito, or your drink spills out the side of your mouth and you don’t realize it lol. But for some reason, the staff at Mesa Dental make all the drama of post appointments not seem to matter. Their knowledge, experience and humor always make my visits warm and enjoyable. Even when the doc is cracking jokes during a root canal!

I will always go to Mesa Dental for my dental needs. Thank you!< /Review>

<Text>I have been coming to Mesa Dental to see Dr. Qadeer for about two years now. Not only is Dr. Qadeer one of the nicest gentlemen you'll ever meet, he is very thorough, communicative, and always makes you feel like you're in good hands. His staff is friendly and efficient, and I've never had a less than positive experience with anyone at his office. I also like that you can pay for a membership and get discounted rates on services. At the time I signed up I needed some work done and it was a better deal than dental insurance for me, and I have just stayed with it as it covers two cleanings and two x-rays per year. I would definitely recommend Mesa Dental to anyone searching for a solid dentist.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Time>1576011148001</Time><Text>This place is great. I’ve been seen as a patient about 3 times now. The service is definitely a step up from corporate dental offices, where they nickel and dime you. Dr. Qadeer is professional and courteous. He honestly tells his opinion about certain options and procedures, and he always leaves decisions up to the patient. My previous dental office would just say “you need to do X, okay will that be cash or card?” It always felt so sleazy. Dr. Qadeer, on the other hand, will always say “my professional opinion is X. If you want to proceed, set up an appointment with the front, and we can consult more in detail.” Keep up the good work!!< /Text><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

<review>Mesa dental is my new spot! I was looking for a new dental office within network and I was really impressed with how well reviewed this office was. Upon arrival the office waiting area is nice and wide with TVs and a mini fridge that offers water. The front desk was really nice as I expected but  the great customer service continued through my visit. I was impressed with the dentist taking the time to review my X-rays and giving me a run down of my dental health. Overall 5 stars. I've been here twice now and o know I'll continue to come. I have even referred three people here because I truly feel this office cares about customer service!
One thing I noticed about this office that I have started to dislike about my last office is that they are honest about what you need without pushing sales...

Also, they have have plenty of parking and the 163 freeway entrance is right out of their parking lot.<//review></record>

All of the staff is super friendly and always makes me feel welcome. Dr. Qadeer explains everything in a way that is easy to understand and made me feel more comfortable with the work I needed done. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.</Text>

Everyone I met was caring and friendly. After x-rays, the dental assistant invited me to be comfortable just like at home. The personal touch at Mesa Dental is calming. I knew I was in good hands!</text>

This was my first time at the dentist office and everyone was very welcoming and friendly.  The office was very clean and the environment was very comfortable. The staff made me feel very welcome and they were very professional.  Dr Qadeer was great and I felt very comfortable with him right away.  He was very thorough and explained everything regarding my treatment which turned out to be more than what I expected.  I would definitely recommend him and his staff to potential customers.<//review>

Going to the dentist is usually not a fun experience, but Dr. Qadeer makes it 1000% more pleasant! He is good at explaining the process and the reasoning behind his recommendations (for the record, I had multiple cavities repaired).

He does a great job distracting you from the more unpleasant parts of the procedures so before you know it, it's over. His staff are also really nice and helpful and make a point to check in on you throughout your whole appointment.< /review>

<Text>Due to horribly weak teeth and an insatiable sweet tooth, my dental needs have always been ridiculously extensive.  When I was in third grade, a dentist told me that I would be in full dentures by the age of 21.
Well, 50 years later, I am happy to say that didn't happen but, it probably would have if not for advancements in dentistry and endless hours spent in a dental chair.  Having so much experience with Dentists and having been subjected to more dental procedures than any one person should ever have to endure in a single lifetime; I consider myself to be somewhat of an expert on dentists.
With that said, my review of Mesa Dental is that they are my all-time favorite dental practice.  My family and I have been going there for three years now and my only complaint is that I wish we had found them many years earlier.  Dr. Qadeer is a superb dentist and it is obvious that he truly care about his patients.  He is always cheerful and friendly, listens carefully to what you have to say, and makes you feel comfortable and confident that you are in good hands, getting quality dental care.  The entire staff at Mesa Dental are a reflection of Dr. Qadeer's positive attitude in that they are always friendly, welcoming, and willing to help you with all your needs.
I highly recommend Mesa Dental and Dr. Qadeer to anyone seeking quality dental care in a friendly and caring environment.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

Mesa Dental is the best dentist in all of San Diego!!! They have a beautiful office, friendly staff, and Dr. is amazing.  He is honest and will make sure your teeth are looking beautiful when you leave!  I needed 2 crowns on my front teeth.  After they did the work, they now look perfect!

<Review>I've had fairly bad experiences at dentist's offices. I have a very small mouth by nature, and I'd had dental assistants be quite disparaging and outright rude about having to work in my mouth. As a result I hadn't been to a dentist for an embarrassing amount of time before a friend recommended Dr. Qadeer's office to me. Any anxiety I had about the visit were gone as soon as I walked into the office. The office itself is lovely, as are the folks working there--every person is warm and inviting. And Dr. Qadeer himself is just the friendliest, most informative person you've ever met. He knew immediately ailments I was likely suffering from as a Type 1 Diabetic and provided me with an amazing amount of information and statistics about dental care with attention I've never received from another dentist. That first visit I discovered that I needed two root canals and had some cavities (that's what 5ish years away from the dentist will get you). The nervousness came back a little at mention of a root canal--was my small mouth going to be an issue again? But the team acknowledged my small opening with respect and in a matter of fact kind of way, instead of implying that it was somehow my fault or a burden (as past dentists had). And the root canal itself was a breeze!!! People had reacted to my news that I needed a root canal with looks of despair and fear, but I barely felt a thing! Dr. Qadeer and his team are heavensent and I cannot recommend them enough (honestly, I promptly recommended them to my sister, my sister's wife, and my mom, and all three have gone and ALSO loved the team).</Review>< pictures>

<text>Started my dental journey back in August after moving back from Asia. I went in super nervous, but mainly embarrassed because I’d not stepped into a dental office in 10 years. I found Mesa Dental through a coworker and could be more pleased!!! From the moment I stepped in the door I’ve received nothing but quality service. I cried at my consolation from embarrassment due to the state of my mouth but mainly because I felt so supported by Dr. Qadeer and his team. I was reassured that everything was fixable and that they were there to help, I felt super comfortable, informed and cared for through the whole process. They worked with me tailored my treatment plan to be accommodate me. Since my first visit I have raved about my experienced and have referred my whole office. Today I came in for my first Invisalign tray and couldn’t be more satisfied. Service remained consistent across the board. Dr. Qadeer and Jimmy were super accommodating to my teeth sensibility and we’re constantly checking in with me to see if I was feeling okay. I have always left the office feeling confident and reassured that I am one step closer to my perfect smile. 100% recommend, no hesitation!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86</gmap_id></record>

So far it's been one of the friendliest and efficient dentists I've been too. Joana is excellent. Qadeer is probably one of the smoothest needle wielders I've ever seen. I hate needles and he makes it such an easy experience.</review>

This is a great place.  Excellent staff and solid dentists.  They put together a quality treatment program for me, walked me through the whole process, and made sure I understood everything every step of the way.  The support staff and dental assistants are great and they were even very understanding when I had to make a last minute appointment cancellation and didn't charge me for it.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist in San Diego.<//text>

Especially if they made their high quality services available to fit your budget?

A trip to Mesa Dental will leave you feeling better than a trip to a spa.  I go at least 4 times a year just to make sure I'm taking the best care of my teeth possible.  See you there!</text>< Pictures>

I was looking for a dentist to take a look and fix some teeth that were in desperate and immediate need of repair. Scared, i chose Mesa Dental among the many dentistry’s out there and to my suprise they lived up to their amazing reputation and took wonderful care of me by not only fixing my teeth but making me feel extremely welcome. Thank you everyone at Mesa Dental!<//Review>

Mesa Dental is awesome! I have been searching all over San Diego for a good dentist and office and I have finally found it! They don't try to upsell you on other services and Amy does not kill your mouth when cleaning your teeth. They were so friendly and made my experience comfortable and convenient. I will definitely WANT to go to the dentist again. Thank you all for an awesome experience!</Review>

I am really happy with the service from Dr Qadeer. I've been coming here since 3 years now. I've had 4 root canals and 6 crowns and 3 fillings from here. No complaints about the quality of work done. Very neat work by the doctor. Must say the doctor is very considerate and made sure I feel comfortable throughout the procedure. He's been very gentle while working on my teeth too. I've referred 2 of my friends here and I guess as long as I am in San Diego Dr.Qadeer will be my dentist.<//review>

<Review>I have been a patient of Dr.Qadeer for several years and I must admit he is one of the best dentists I have seen out there; honest, caring and patient. I had two fillings and a crown done by him and no complain. What I love about his work is that he explains everything from X-rays to treatment plan in a way you understand. I have referred all my coworkers and friends to his office and I would always do so.  Great quality work.</Review>< pictures>

Never thought I’d say I LOVED getting a filling! I was totally freaked out and nervous and Dr. Qadeer put my mind at ease. There was no pain, and I felt that I was in control and could ask him to pause at any time. I felt comfortable, and the staff was funny and kind. I am a new loyal patient to this office, and I’d strongly recommend them to anyone who is afraid of the dentist - they got me over my fear!</review>

Dr. Qadeer and his team are really friendly and patient with you. I had some bad anxiety my first two visits because I've had terrible dentist experiences in the past. The warm welcoming environment here really makes a difference. Plus, you get to see before and after pictures of the teeth they work on. My only critique is that it gets really busy.< /text>

I really love Mesa Dental! Whether it's scheduling an appointment, taking x-rays or cleaning your teeth, the staff is incredibly positive and they do their best to make you feel comfortable.
Dr Qadeer is a wealth of knowledge and genuinely cares about his patients.
I always feel like "part of the family" when I walk into Mesa Dental. It's definitely a place you can trust!< /text>

Dr. Qadeer and his team are really friendly and patient with you. I had some bad anxiety my first two visits because I've had terrible dentist experiences in the past. The warm welcoming environment here really makes a difference. Plus, you get to see before and after pictures of the teeth they work on. My only critique is that it gets really busy.< /text>

I had 2 root canals done in a single visit and it went so smooth. The staff there are an amazing bunch too. Max was so patient and made sure I was comfortable through out the procedure.

<text>BEFORE I found Mesa Dental, I strongly disliked going to the dentist. NOW, I actually don’t mind going! Every employee I have encountered is friendly and really cares about my comfort while I’m there!  Dr. Qadeer is first-class and I trust him with my smile, which is very expensive after braces when I was younger and now Invisalign! I highly recommend Mesa Dental to anyone looking for a great dentist in the San Diego area, especially if past dentist experiences have been rather displeasing! Thanks Mesa!< /text><username>Julie DeScenzo<//username><resp>None< /resp>< time>

I have been a patient of Dr.Qadeer for several years and I must admit he is one of the best dentists I have seen out there; honest, caring and patient. I had two fillings and a crown done by him and no complain. What I love about his work is that he explains everything from X-rays to treatment plan in a way you understand. I have referred all my coworkers and friends to his office and I would always do so.  Great quality work.<//text>

I would strongly recommend Mesa Dental to anyone with children. We were greated with a smile and positive energy. Ismael not only made my daughter comfortable he educated her in way she could understand her exact words were he was sweet and it was fun. I also received very good information in how to take better care of my teeth. I felt very welcome by all the staff. We are looking forward to coming back! t</Review>

<text>There are plenty of dentists good and bad and don’t get me wrong Mesa is on the good side of dentists thanks to Dr. Qadeer but one thing in common with all dentists is that they try to spend the shortest time as possible w/each patient at the maximum cost to the patient, and leave the dirty work to the assistants. If you don’t have insurance, you’re screwed! 💰💸
But 1 little known difference between Mesa and others is Mesa asks patients to write reviews and if they’re negative, they’re asked to change them after they’ve been posted. I know because it happened to me. They are using lots of smoke and mirrors on social media to inflate their ratings. Just look at their other social media posts. Is any dentist perfect? Impossible! That's the result when you ask only happy patients to review and negative reviews are asked to edit. I will never change this review and wish it to remain here for eternity for all to see. I wish to remain anonymous for obvious reasons but I have had extensive work done w/ Dr. Qadeer but never again. I have my reasons and will keep them to myself out of fear of unwanted contact to edit this or feedback from the dentist himself trying to discount my claims or criticize me.

I cannot begin to describe how incredible this office is!!! I have seen many dentists in my life... but Doctor Qadeer and his staff are by far superior! Amazing people and fun environment! That’s right... I said fun! Haha I would recommend them to anyone! Especially those who have had bad experiences or fear visiting the dentist. They are incredibly gentle, informative and pressure free! Not to mention the work they do is amazing! I kid you not when I say that this office has changed the way that I feel about visiting the dentist.. and I feel so SO fortunate to have found them!!! Thanks Dr Q and team! Much love! ❤️❤️❤️❤️<//Review>

I honestly don’t mind going to the dentist anymore!! My last two visits I’ve had Jimmy who took my xrays and helped Dr. Qadeer. These two are the dream team!!!

Dr. Qadeer and the staff of Mesa Dental have made my dental journey much better than I could have ever expected. Dental hygiene was not a big part of my childhood which made me ashamed and afraid to go to the Dentist as an adult.

I've been going to Mesa Dental since October. I finally decided to make the trip because of a tooth that was giving me extreme pain. I was disappointed but not surprised to find out that I needed work on a few teeth.

Throughout this while process Dr. Qadeer and the the staff of Mesa Dental have treated me with respect and have given me a new feeling about going to the dentist. I no longer feel ashamed and look forward to taking care of dental hygiene.

My oldest has recently began doing to Mesa Dental as well. While I can't say that she shares the same level of joy that I do about dental hygiene, she has come a long way from her fear of dentist and has expressed how thorough Dr. Qadeer is. Her previous dentist told her that her teeth were good to go, only to find out she had some valid tooth pain which has since been resolved.

I can go on and on, everyone has different experiences, but I have never had a kinder or more through dental staff.  I truly do have a sence of comfort which is something I never thought I would feel going to the dentist.<//text>

<text>Coming to this dental clinic was the best decision I have made, when my friend had recommended them to me I didn't imagine how good they are; the doctors there are highly professional and generous. They afford all the sufficient time and knowledge for consultation. Dr. nasery was kind and gentle, he removed all my fears and made me a perfect crown without feeling any pain or discomfort. I will recommend all my friends to come here too.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I LOVE MY DENTIST!!! I needed a lot of work done, and I'm so glad I carefully chose Mesa Dental!! They are worth every penny!! If you're going to make an investment on your teeth, I 100% recommend Dr. Qadeer! He is extremely professional, caring, and his facility is super clean. I could go on and on about how satisfied I am with my dentist, just his attitude alone makes you want to come back. You'll know what I'm referring too, once you experience GREAT QUALITY DENTAL CARE yourself. I wouldn't look elsewhere! Dr. Qadeer is the one! 🙂< /Text><GmapID>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86</GmapID><user>108057644285438684167</user><Resp>{'time': 1576010960590, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your awesome review!

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I had an amazing experience with Mesa Dental. I came in for a cosmetic fix. I had a crown done a few years ago that looked awful (traditional military handiwork) I decided I would go with a porcelain replacement.  It was a multistep procedure that left me with the perfect smile. It looks completely natural and I don't feel that grating sensation I had with my first crown. Great Experience!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>In March 2012, I went to Mesa Dental for two crowns on my very front, top teeth (old sports injury).  Trust me, I would not give a vendor 5 stars unless they earned 5 stars.  That's how I am.  From my first visit to Mesa, I was treated very respectfully and with an overwhelmingly friendly attitude - from each and every staffmember.  They are attentive to details, truly interested in your physical appearance, and willing to explain the required procedures as well as cost/benefit of discretionary services.  They work with great partners (I was referred for a root canal) as well.  They were flexible in scheduling, and I was always seen by the dentist on time with no delay (series of 5 or 6 appointments).  I am now a lifelong customer of Mesa Dental, and I would recommend them to any family and friends.  My mouth is healthy, and my very prominent two front teeth look really amazing.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I spent almost 10 years avoiding the dentist because of experiencing a horrible dental visit in my early 20’s. Thankfully I was referred to Dr. Qadeer at Mesa Dental by a good friend when I was in desperate need and I haven’t missed a cleaning or appointment since.
Ive had several fillings and plenty of work to make up for the 10 years of no dental visits. I am so grateful to find such a knowledgeable and gentle dentist who has made the experience so much easier. The staff is all truly amazing as well.
The dentist for some of us can be so scary but what I’ve learned is you can’t judge all by one bad experience.
Thank you Dr. Qadeer and the staff for helping keep my smile healthy and beautiful!</text>

Ive lived in San Diego for 7 years and have been to 5 different dentists. It's difficult to find a dentists who has the patients best interest in mind. Dr Qadeer is that dentist, he is extremely friendly and thorough with his work. He takes routine pictures to ensure that the patient knows exactly what is happening throughout the process and why they were treated. I never saw the entire process of a cavity filling unit I came to Mesa Dental, aside from being interesting I found it to be very reassuring that they cared about their work and the patients. Dr Qadeer takes his time with his patients and doesn't rush through his appointments, he treats you as if you were family. I would say that their 5 star rating is not "faked" as someone mentioned, all of the staff is genuinely helpful and friendly. All medical practices can get complicated when insurance is involved but this is BY FAR the best dentist I've had in San Diego and I would highly recommend them.<//Text>

He explains everything clearly, does perfect work (a situation where I appreciate OCD) and is fun. He and the staff are always humming along to the music on the radio, making me want to join in. I'd recommend this place to anyone.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Leaving me messages on a phone number that I did not give them when they already have my personal number and have already left me voicemails. When I asked how they got that number they said because they have my wife's information on file. Her information is NOT mine. If you can't get my personal details right then I'm not definitely not trusting you with my care.<//Text>

<Review>I've been overwhelmingly impressed with Mesa Dental. Dr. Qadeer helps me feel at ease, is careful and very gentle - something super important for those of us who hate to get our teeth worked on. I've had a crown put in elsewhere with great discomfort, and was really surprised to discover that with a good dentist, it doesn't have to be that way! Dr. Qadeer is highly professional and cares a lot about the quality his final product - your dental health! He leads a friendly and knowledgeable team who all seem super happy to work alongside him. It's a very positive, respectful environment.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Unprofessional , absolutely no dental or medical knowledge of any kind . They need to know how to respect their customers , I don't think such dentist office can ever treat any patient ! , He also need to learn some medical terms and to have some better dental skills ! when I compare this dentist to any dentist I have seen and been to , I can touch the poor quality and the limited capability and the subnormal performance . Conclusion: Tho office overall need to follow some US guidelines and the dental association recommendations to establish a better customer review. they also need to learn what investigations to do and what not to do in order not to over charge and manipulate with the insurance.< /text>

This is a great group of people. Dr. Qadeer and his staff made me feel at ease throughout my procedure. They have a great bedside manner and sense of humor which is very imprtant to me. I have referred several people to this dentist. While going to the dentist is never fun they make it much more tolerable.</Text>

I was very happy and pleased with Dr. Qadeer's work. He kept me informed every step of the way as he worked on me for crown work. I liked that very much. Patients who are informed  while the procedure is being done feel more comfortable in the chair. He was very professional and I would recommend Dr. Qadeer and Mesa Dental.< /Review>

<text>I had the best experience with Dr Nasery. I was so scared of dentists before him. His extraordinary gentle approach has totally transformed me. He performs beautiful cosmetic dental work - my unsightly front teeth is now bright white and straight - a really natural result. Thanks to the team there you won't ever want another dentist after Dr Nasery<//text>< Name>

My family has been coming to Mesa Dental for years and they will all tell you that Dr. Qadeer is the best dentist ever!

I had a root canal done this morning by Dr. Qadeer. Trust me, I had no reservations, doubts nor fears because the good doctor has proven himself to be exceptional in the past. And today he easily lived up to that expectation. He and his staff are friendly and put you at ease. The doctor is gentle in his demeanor and skilled to where I don't worry about pain. This is what makes him the best family dentist!

I'll recommend Mesa Dental to anyone, especially the biggest scaredy-cats!</Text>

Horrible, Horrible, Horrible experience!

They are very pushy & rush everything they are doing & make you pay for something that your not ready to pay for yet! Unprofessional, rude, unfriendly & not welcoming to new guests! Dr. Qadeer was friendly but his staff need better professionalism towards guests!< /review>

<Text>It is always an intimidating experience to go to the Dentist, you never know what you are expecting. As a student with limited funds I decided to try Mesa Dental. I could not be more pleased with my decision. As I arrived in the office I was instantly greeted by the receptionist, and most importantly I waited less than 5 minutes to be seen!!!

Dr. Nasery and Benny were both absolutely amazing! I instantly felt comfortable and at ease with the both of them. Dr. Nasery provided me with honest and comprehensive information about the dental work that I needed. Benny made my time enjoyable at the dentist as well! FInding a good dentist is hard to come by these days. I highly recommend Mesa Dental!! :)</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<review>I absolutely recommend Dr. Qadeer at Mesa Dental and his staff.  He is the first dentist who was able to help me overcome my fear I had due to my traumatizing past experiences at other offices.  I love the family-like atmosphere at Mesa Dental and appreciate the effort to make me feel comfortable.  Everyone is very friendly and reassuring.  Dr. Qadeer also takes care of my kids' teeth and has done a great job with them too.  He is the first dentist they actually like going to, which is quite an achievement.  We have been going to Dr. Qadeer for several years and couldn't be happier.<//review><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dbffe26a705c37:0x1641336a0e048d86< /gmap_id>< Time>

< Review>
They always get you in and it super fast. I've only ever had to wait once and it was because they were short staffed. Still done in less than two hours. The Dr gave me info on medicine for my fever blister when I had one and he couldn't work on me. He remembered that I hate the dryness of the gause in my mouth (gives me cringing heebie jeebies) so he limits it. We cut up and tell jokes. It's a super comfortable atmosphere. I dig them.<//Review>

<text>I rarely shill for or "Yelp" about customer service I recieve unless I had a horrible experience. Today however I am posting to recommend the best damn dentist I've ever been to and I've been to a LOT. I've always been uncomfortable/terrified of the dentist and have been trying to find one who not only does good work but is gentle and who's  customer care and staff makes me feel comfortable. Mesa Dental in San Diego is by faaaaar the best care I've EVER recieved. The staff is super friendly, they listen and care about our comfort and did a GREAT job! Dr. Qadeer and his staff are a pleasure to be around. Today i had an implant set on a broken molar. I still have more work to do and am actually looking forward to my next few visits. I HIGHLY recommend them for any dental work for anyone in the San Diego area. I really appreciate the care! Thank you for your service Doc! See ya soon! BIG up ! 😆😆😆</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>I went to Mesa Dental to get two crowns done on my front teeth. I was referred by a co-worker who has been going there for many years. I have been to many dentists throughout my life and I am sure that I will go nowhere else but Mesa Dental. Dr. Nasery and the staff were awesome! The crowns are perfect Dr. Nasery was so detailed and I never felt as if he was rushing, which made me feel he really cares about his patients. I can't even tell they are crowns because he did such a great job without any discomfort. Thanks Dr. Nasery!</text>< Pics>

This place is the friendliest, cleanest, professional, and the most welcoming dental office ever! My teeth feels very loved every time I come here. Wonderful teamwork and I fully trust them with my teeth and gums not being in pain because they actually care to make sure you're numb before doing anything else. Dr. Qadeer and his wonderful team (Benny & Jimmy at that time) let you signal them if anything is wrong. It is very considerate of them; you feel like your feelings matter. Unlike some offices where they want to get the job done without interferences. It's also a bonus because they also conversate back to you even when your trying to talk with your mouth open they totally understand you and will make you smile with all the great stories they tell you. They tell you procedures everytime. I have never left the office unure of the post care for any of my teeth. They listen and are very open minded to all your questions you can ask them without them making you feel bad about how you have taken care of your teeth before. They offer great solutions if any problems or worries occur. They take the time to make it a great experience for everyone and they make it very fun and thats when the time passes by very quickly. & They always tell their patience that we did a good job making it a great teamwork. I don't remember anytime where I look forward to going to my dentist appointments. I don't mind driving a little farther for this place it is so worth it. I'm so grateful for all the hard work that Dr. Qadeer and his staff has put in. The wonderful team they have established and the bond they have with each other it really feels like family. They enjoy their job so much it shows. Highly recommended to anyone that wants a perfect dentist place. I recommended this place to my best friend and she can be very hard to persuade but she really enjoys this office as well!< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have gotten a number of treatments done with all of the doctors at Mesa Dental and I would be lying if I said I was still afraid of the dentist!  Each experience has been quite pleasant to say the least.  Who gets to lay in a massage chair with a flat screen TV inches from your face while you're getting a filling?  I have probably fallen asleep in the chair its so comfortable!  Besides everyone in the office being so professional and friendly, each person in the office genuinely goes above and beyond so that you're in and out of there in no time, which is weird because its an office you would actually want to spend more time in! lol These sweet people deserve a raise!

Now if you're a big baby like myself, lets talk about the scary pain issue.  More like lack thereof! I don't know what their secret is, but I've never, EVER felt any pain or sensitivity in ANY of my appointments.  Not even in my root canals! (Yes, root canalSSS) After the first root canal expecting the worst, I was so surprised to not feel anything! Not even the initial needle for the anesthesia! I even begged for topical for that shot and they laughed at me :( So I clenched every muscle in my body to prepare and came to realized why they laughed. They knew exactly where to poke the needle and how to slowly ease the injection in my gums.  I was so comfortable, yes, comfortable, I wanted to take the tools and add more pressure to the scraping of my roots!  I know, TMI, but I have to be thorough.  In conclusion, eating a popsicle with my two front teeth hurts me more.

Thank you Mesa Dental for everything, you rock! <3</Review>

Dr. Qadeer is the best dentist...he is kind, caring, cmpassionate and friendly!  My husband hates going to the dentist and will only go to Dr. Qadeer.  He is great with kids and adults.  I can't say enough good things about him as a patient of his for the past 8 years!</review>

Wow, I'm actually beyond impressed by what Mesa dental did for my grandmother. It definitely took a long time for her treatment to finish, but Dr Qadeer had explained it that it was gonna take this long from the beginning. Ok, so I took my granma to like three different dentists, including the one that she had been going to for 17years, because her denture was loose & wiggled when she talked it was hurting her gums when she ate bread or something. Two of them told her to see a specialist cause she had no bone for the denture to hook to. Anyways, we came here cause my coworker told me to see this dentist, cause she wouldn't go anywhere else, but here for her dental work. I gotta say, we definitely made the right choice. So the dentist recommended to put these metal posts implants in her bone & then hook the denture to these & it will keep the denture really tight. Maaan,  thanks for technology. It took like 8 appointments, between the surgeon & here, but as of Friday she is seriously pretty happy. My granma is 77 years old, & I didn't know how she might take this whole treatment, but she handled it very well! Ever since she got her teeth done here I have became patient of Dr.qadeer. I really love this guy's honesty as I was told to have bunch of stuff done but I came to Him and he recommended I get one tooth done so it doesn't break! These folks are great here.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Mesa Dental,, located right across from Kearny High School/Mesa college, off of Mesa College Dr, is by far one of the best dentistry I have been to thus far. My purpose of visit was for a checkup. First impressions: The receptionist was courteous and was very fast in getting my paperwork entered (since I am a new patient). Then I went on to the x-rays, took about 2 minutes, it was quick. Afterwards, I went on with the teeth cleaning and FREE teeth whitening. All of this was done within 40 minutes of my visit. Dr. Ehsan Nasery has a lot of knowledge with dentistry, and really does care about his patients. Pros: friendliness, great customer service, knowledge, and cutting edge dental technology. Cons: None! They also have another location called Cabrillo Dental, near Sharps Memorial hospital in Kearny Mesa. This place calls for a re-visit once I am due. THANK YOU MESA DENTAL STAFF, you are the BEST!<//review>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I love Japanese food. It took me while to finally find a great Japanese restaurant in Sunnyvale, close to Santa Clara where tons of great Korean restaurants are.  You have to try the fried rice ball, it is not on there regular lunch menu, but we saw a lot of tables ordered it so we asked the waitress for it. It has very nice texture. Their sushi is very fresh. Unlike most of the Japanese restaurants, their portion is big. Their price is reasonable based on the quality of the food and the large portion. I strongly recommend Tanto to all Japanese food lovers!< /text>< pics>

Amazing and authentic Japanese tapas. We had the pork belly, scallops with salmon roe, squid stuffed with rice (sauce on side), and the beef tongue. Everything was delicious and that was the perfect amount for 2 people.

Will definitely be back here and will make a reservation next time to avoid the 30min wait!</Text>

<Review>My third time here and it is still one of my favorite place. The crispy Salmon rice ball is so good. There so many choices on their menu both cooked and the typical sashimi/sushi. a small place so either go early to stand in line or call for reservation. If you call one week ahead you will have a better chance of getting what you want. Make sure to save room for desert!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><time>1616567146578< /time>< gmapID>

The menu, containing perhaps a hundred different dishes, is a bit overwhelming for someone like me who is not too familiar with Japanese food. Each dish is described in around three words. The waiter was helpful, but there was only so much he could do. I was happy with my selection, but it may have been mostly luck on my first visit. On my second visit I had sashimi, which was excellent -- especially considering how cheap it was.< /text>

Best Japanese izakaya in South Bay. Go to dish is Temaki Set. Take and make sushi at it's best. But pretty much everything there is good. They have a huge menu.< /Review>

<response>None<//response><Text>I have been coming here for 20 years when they were authentic Japanese Izakaya located in a smaller location further down El Camino. They served authentic Japanese tapas to accompany drinking and mingling with friends and colleagues. They have shifted their clientele now to serve non-Japanese customers, and their strategy is paying off with lines out the door (before the "New Normal") and the menu is also catering towards the local preferences.
During SIP, Tanto is offering a good selection of set meals for families to enjoy at home. Keep up the good work, I shall return when this is all over.</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<Review>The food was good but expensive. Service was attentive. My only complaint was the short haired hostess behind the table. She had such a poor manner with a grumpy face and a rude gesture. I hope owner replaces her with someone more pleasant to interact with. If she is the owner, I am not returning.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPJkbzc63u_UqJ8S3MVd_0TJnCIHDC53cVMAPB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO80xvexgcvcgc29e6yvt1ba6rUoqoxM_pla1w3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeZRzuuPCl0bHrCsajuzpEDeuFCdxWMQjzIjfv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEhVFHHZNo19KJOevFJ7sT291BnbhvepaOuy4h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgKJcPAuhINiwRyIOV3ZLO0F11Dn5p_JWXXZTX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVrjWtD3YOPUt680Yy8oNMjtnjSPGGhvzuy8Jb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<time>1580535344920< /time><Rate>3< /Rate><review>We ordered Onigiri and uni fried rice, the two most popular dishes on google reviews, and omelet with spicy roe. The omelet turned out to be very creamy and tasty.  But we were very disappointed by the other two - uni was very bitter, and you never knew whether your next bite of the onigiri would be too salty or no flavor at all.

We ended up ordering a 4th dish hoping for better luck - the chicken kaarage. Nope, it was so plain that I finished the mayo half way thru the kaarage and kept adding red pepper flakes. There were also pieces that were too skinny to be chicken meat and were straight up fried flour.

In the end we were very glad that we only waited 5 minutes for this place. The good parts about this restaurant:
1) we were very full after all that rice
2) there’s a clean and bright korean market across the street that you can wander around and digest all that rice</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP651uR2t_acdXRwySBtDXVsCvjDnKfjUGGtSVO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7yvTMkRFecWcEebQskU0TSF1iiKt4DZnRdpsQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl2D4qrGL7HR86RcZzATElTX4XGVRqAJAokojG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwZTJNaYKVIOuknTNLd12UKBSyL3Xaiu3zmsR1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

Great diversity of plates, loved the family style. Service was pretty fast. Liver and tongue were my favorites. Don't forget to taste some of their sake. The place is a bit noisy so not the place for a date.</review>

So delicious! Every dish was unique, and offered an interesting set second flavours for the epicurean appetite. My favourite dishes were the Hotate butter uni nose, Umaki Tamago, and the Kani Gratin. Also good were their oyster dishes and the Uni Shisho sashimi dish. The uni was not quite as creamy or delicate tasting as hoped, but the portion size was decent for the price. Last, we tried their ice cream dessert - beware, it is a lot to share and we could barely finish it after all the food we ate.</review>

Drove here all the way from Berkeley. It was quite the drive in rush hour traffic, however, it was well worth! We waited for about 30 minutes for a table for 2 on a Thursday night. Once we sat down and ordered, our food literally all arrived within 10 minutes. On top of all that, everything was delicious! If it weren't for the wait, this place would have been a 5 star restaurant, the wait took one of the star away. Make a reservation, and thank me later. 😁<//text>

<review>Excellent Japanese food, and good presentation. Usually, there are three lunch sets to choose. If don't like the lunch sets, there are many other dishes on menu to select. This place is always crowdy at lunch, so try to arrive early if you do not want to wait.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaP5T7cULv5ugTCUXcWxCkVWpVF8Zy6blHjAsY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Rating>

<gmap_id>0x808fb5f01cd7d477:0x5bfd6bcbc43a35b3<//gmap_id><Text>This is not the first time that My order was not ready at the scheduled pick up time but the experience I had last night was unprecedentedly disappointing. My two persons dinner set was scheduled for pick up at 5:50pm. Upon arrival, I was told it would be ready in 10 mins. I returned in 10 mins and was told they were still working on it and would call me when ready, and it was another 8 mins of wait in the cold winter. I noticed that there were at least 3 couples were waiting for their scheduled orders like I did but come on, what's the point of scheduling if you have been consistently unable to deliver on time? I rarely give negative ratings but I think I'm obligated to flag others just in case they want to order from them. For sure I will not be going back. There are still plenty of choices out there.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

We reserved through phone call in advance. The service is good and quick. Overall, the taste is excellent.

Salmon sashimi is very delicious and fresh with decent amount. Grilled beef tongue is also recommended.<//Review>

Perfect izakakaya experience right here in South Bay. Tanto stands out from the rest of the izakayas around here not in terms of food but more in terms of the atmosphere it creates. The food is top notch too. But the friendly folks who wait on you here made the experience for me.<//Review>

<Review>This 4 stars is based on CP, prices are reasonable.  Unfortunately, flavors and tastes earned 3 stars.  The ika meshi probably was the better dish, interesting sauce, fresh ika.  The sashimi on the salad was not very fresh.   The eggplant gratin tasted strange, think it was the cheese.  Beef tendon was too sweet.  Omelette with eel was so so.  The rest very so so.  Dishes all came very fast.  Service was okay.< /Review>< pictures>

A cozy real Japanese restaurant. There are always queue but it worths to wait. They also serve pretty fast especially during lunch. Eel bowl was very good and their lunch specials are pretty good too.<//Text>

The omelet turned out to be very creamy and tasty.  But we were very disappointed by the other two - uni was very bitter, and you never knew whether your next bite of the onigiri would be too salty or no flavor at all.

We ended up ordering a 4th dish hoping for better luck - the chicken kaarage. Nope, it was so plain that I finished the mayo half way thru the kaarage and kept adding red pepper flakes. There were also pieces that were too skinny to be chicken meat and were straight up fried flour.

In the end we were very glad that we only waited 5 minutes for this place. The good parts about this restaurant:
1) we were very full after all that rice
2) there’s a clean and bright korean market across the street that you can wander around and digest all that rice< /review><date>1580535344920<//date><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP651uR2t_acdXRwySBtDXVsCvjDnKfjUGGtSVO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7yvTMkRFecWcEebQskU0TSF1iiKt4DZnRdpsQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl2D4qrGL7HR86RcZzATElTX4XGVRqAJAokojG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwZTJNaYKVIOuknTNLd12UKBSyL3Xaiu3zmsR1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics></record>

<Review>Be prepared to wait up to an hour without a reservation, though I must say the wait was well worth it. Tanto has a wide variety of tapas from the familiar to the utterly unique. Some of these unique dishes have been the reason for my friends and I frequenting this location. Secondly, the pricing when compared with the level of food is unbeatable and the sake selection is wonderful. Bring and appetite, you won't be disappointed if you love Japanese Tapas.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

So delicious! Every dish was unique, and offered an interesting set second flavours for the epicurean appetite. My favourite dishes were the Hotate butter uni nose, Umaki Tamago, and the Kani Gratin. Also good were their oyster dishes and the Uni Shisho sashimi dish. The uni was not quite as creamy or delicate tasting as hoped, but the portion size was decent for the price. Last, we tried their ice cream dessert - beware, it is a lot to share and we could barely finish it after all the food we ate.</Text>

<Review>We waited almost an hour for a table at 7 pm on a weekday. We just wanted a light dinner/snack. The food came out almost alarmingly fast? The miso pork lettuce wrap came almost immediately after we ordered. The takopotato was pretty good but I think I prefer takoyaki.. it was like mashed potato balls with sparse pieces of octopus. The agedashi tofu was very good. I would rate it a 3.5.</Review><Rate>4< /Rate><user_id>110849545386955165019< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

The best value and place for lunch when craving for Japanese food. My favorite is silver cod lunch set and littleneck clam salt ramen noodle soup. There usually are additional three lunch special sets that you can choose from. Even though the prices have increased a lot like other restaurants in the bay area, it is worth it!
Sadly, they don't have my favorite silver cod today.<//text>

It is wonderful! The sashimi test wonderful. Sashimi salad is kind of oily, but well flavored! I ordered hamachi Kama, too. It was great one. Low oil and low salt. The ice cream is my favorite!

The wait was a little long, but worth it.
The salmon and white tuna sashimi was excellent.
The pork salad had shredded cooked and lightly vinegared pork and was very good
The halibut sashimi was only ok to my taste.
The butter enoki and shitake mushrooms had surprise bacon and were good/ok.
The black sesame ice cream tasted like smoky sesame oil and I didn't care for it.
The ice cream with red bean was delicious and is a mountain of ice cream with a swirl of red bean paste on the side surrounded by little rice-only mochi balls.
Very interesting and authentic menu. Looking forward to coming back to try more!

Second visit:
Salmon sashimi was again fantastic.
White tuna was very good. Next time will try another fish though.
Garlic steak was good but wouldn’t reorder.
Minced miso pork wrapped in lettuce cups was literally a head off price in a cup and tasted very fermented. Would not order again.< /text>

The dishes are delicious and authentic Japanese style with modern twists. The portion is very generous for a tapas and it makes difficult to try many dishes at one visit. They need to be creative something like  a smaller portion with lower price. Service is very quick and friendly, but needs to be a little more attentive.< /text>

We tried to eat here at about 9pm on Saturday night -- Google said they were open but they stop seating new customers at 8:30pm.  Blah.  Restaurant has a good reputation but we didn't get to try this time.  Went to En down the road instead.<//Text>

Try the kimchi fried rice in clay pot!  It's very good. We had several tables ask us what it was when it arrived.  In general all the food we tried was so good and the portion size is worth the price. The three of us ordered 6 dishes and had over stuffed ourselves and had some food left over. Staff was very friendly and quick! A few cons, it is very noisy when it's full and the air gets a bit stuffy (low ceiling).  If couples want privacy, there are more private seating available.< /text>

<text>Legit Japanese food with fresh seafood! Tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) was crispy but when you get it as a bowl, it gets covered in gooey eggs. The eggs does make it a bit soggy but more flavorful! Udon was perfectly chewy and broth was light and full with umami. A small side salad was provided for all lunch plates and bowls.

Ambience is homey and comfortably dim. Make a reservation if you have a large party during lunch! It gets packed by 12 and can be pretty loud, which made it a bit difficult to talk to people.< /text>< pics>

< review>
This excellent restaurant is completely out of place in its area, where it is surrounded by fast-food restaurants and uninspiring store fronts. We went there twice in a week, and there were guests waiting for tables at all times. We waited 10 minutes the first time and 2 minutes the second time. The menu, containing perhaps a hundred different dishes, is a bit overwhelming for someone like me who is not too familiar with Japanese food. Each dish is described in around three words. The waiter was helpful, but there was only so much he could do. I was happy with my selection, but it may have been mostly luck on my first visit. On my second visit I had sashimi, which was excellent -- especially considering.< /review>

Every time we have people visit from out of town my wife insists we take them there and I am totally cool with that.  We usually gorge ourselves and drink plenty of warm sake and it works out to be about $100 for two.  Book if possible and they don't take bookings the day of the booking.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

The food was worth the wait. My friend ordered sushi, but I don't care to eat raw items much here. I loved the grilled and braised preparations. Sharing with a friend with rice was perfect. Even with many orders of food and rounds of drinks, our bill was only ~$110 for a satisfying dinner celebration. The interior is small, almost bordering cramped, but in a booth, it was intimate and cozy. The service was attentive, though they seemed a bit overwhelmed; sitting at a corner table made it challenging to flag for some help. Can't wait to have an occasion to come back.<//Review>

< Review>
Very authentic Japanese menu and service. A lot of options on the menu amd it can be confusing to navigate.

Friendly service and the waitress helped me navigate the menu and find a gluten free option.

My colleagues, including one from Tokyo, were very happy with the menu. My Japanese colleague received a menu in Japanese and found it easy to order in his native language.</Review>

Most food was sub par or just okay with the exception of the yaki onigiri. Service is pretty poor as they pretty much ignore you after serving food. I wouldn't normally mind this type of service at a Japanese restaurant if they weren't expecting tips, but they try to get you to pay tip on taxes as well.<//Review>

I got the combination dinner, and whilst it was a good portion of food, it was okay - nothing particularly special. We also arrived probably an hour to closing, and service seemed to be non-existent. If you want to shut earlier, then just move up your closing time, but don't set it so that people are still coming in and you are rushing them out mid-meal.</text>

<review>Good food. Nice cosy place. Servers are very kind. Was very crowded.. didnt expect that. Fried chicken was great. Fish not so good. Red Snapper we ordered was cooked nice but was lacking taste. The food is good for the price. But I will shell some more bucks and get better food. Wont go back here.

I was not going for beer this time but the sake was good.<//review>< Pics>

<review>So illI star by saying this is not a sushi restaurant. With that said, it is the best Japanese restaurant around. Casual, fantastic food. Large variety. Quick on the service. Friendly atmosphere. If you are not familiar with traditional Japanese tapas food, get ready to Google all the menu items. Well worth it!!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

The service was polite and efficient, and the food was off the wall flavorfully delicious. The food presentation was artistic and abundant. From the sashimi salad and stir fried udon noodles with pork to the orders of deep fried and grilled smelt with roe; each were highly flavorful. New for me was and incredible was the monk fish liver wrapped in thinly sliced halibut. Yeah, I had an eating experience worthy of repeating. So if you're visiting like me make Tanto Japanese restaurant and must stop.<//Review>

Excellent. The number of actual Japanese customers was very encouraging, and even though I arrived just a few minutes after opening on a Wednesday, the place was already starting to fill up.  The staff was helpful and attentive.  I had the hot stone beef based on some reviews I saw and it was indeed delicious.  The staff's Sake recommendation was good.< /Text>

< Review>
I’m writing this review from the restaurant in the hopes that by delaying my departure I can regain some hunger to justify ordering more.   It took 15 minutes for me to decide exactly what to order (whole menu looked fantastic, although I can see why some patrons wished there were pictures as some of the dishes were still difficult to imagine based on the words).  Waiter helped narrow my choices which ended up being:   (1) Yuan-style black cod, (2) Grilled beef tongue, & (3) Hamachi yellowtail sashimi.   All were excellent.   Would’ve paid at least 2x if I had done this from my fav restaurants in NYC.   Taste was epic.  Like the food version of gliding in pow at Alta.   Environment is low key - Tee shirts and jeans & sneakers were commonplace here.  Wait staff was attentive, but not overbearing.  Can’t believe this restaurant is just sitting around the low key digs hereabouts w/o greater crowds &/or pretentiousness.  I’ll take my friends and fam back for sure next time I get the chance.  Best meal in weeks, if not months.</Review>

Very authentic and tasty. The only negative is getting a table! The restaurant is constantly full till its closing. Get out of your comfort zone and order something that is not usually served in mainstream Japanese restaurants.< /Review>

This place is perfect for authentic, delicious Japanese food.  The sushi is tasty and reasonably priced.  The salmon is always cooked perfectly.  Arrive early though, because there is ALWAYS a line during weekday lunch and dinner.  Closed Mondays.</review>

This was the best Izakaya I've ever been too, which isn't saying much since it's the only one I've ever been to... Nevertheless, the food was amazing, the service is probably as fast as possible (i.e. theoretically possible, not just saying it for effect) as all dishes my table ordered were served within 6 minutes. As someone who is very loosely vegetarian, I can say that this restaurant has a wide diversity of meatless dishes. They aren't meat dishes with the meat substituted: they are just straight up dishes designed in the first place without meat in mind.<//Text>

Great place for a night out with your SO! Such authentic, delicious Japanese food, we always end up getting too much and walking out stuffed and happy. Very busy place, as it's popular, so arrive early to avoid the long dinner line.< /Review>

“Are ready to order” three times in one minute.
“Here is your check” after first dish was served.

I ate chicken feather by the end. Beautiful white plume. Although they waived my bill, it is still a horrible place.

I still feel nauseous.</Text>

<text>Had to wait about half an hour not having a reservation on Friday peak dinner time. Excellent service, top quality sashimi, also enjoyed the clam miso soup. There's private alcoves of various sizes, very cozy.
The menu has many options beyond sushi and sashimi.</text>< pictures>

One of the few Japanese Tapas place in the Bay area I would recommend. Their uni meshi would def recommend if you like uni. I would suggest you to make reservation a day before because they do not do same day reservation and it gets very pack.< /review>

A hidden gem of authentic, high quality Japanese food with a wide spectrum from sashimi, udon to izakaya. Lines are always long, lunch or dinner. But lunch lines are relatively shorter and they have great lunch options (some dishes changing daily) that aren't available for dinner.< /review>

Very busy authentic Japanese restaurant but there was a cockroach running on my table which ruined the whole experience. It was quite large and casualy came up and drinking the spilled tea on my table. I called the server and she grabbed the napkin and smashed it on the table. Ewww they need a better pest control! I don’t know what is happening in the kitchen if a large cockroach roaming in the dining hall during rush hour.<//text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Date>1506827183685</Date><text>Came here Saturday night and the place was full. Entered the restaurant and saw bunch of people waiting but nobody greeted me and told me what to do next.  Tried to walk to the cashiers desk and waited a little bit. I were told that the wait is about 30 mins but their last call is 8:30 so we have to order right away if seated and that’s the last round.

Bad service. Lied on the business hours.<//text></record>

I have been to a couple of izakaya places in the bay area and I must say this is the best. Everything we ordered were very delicious. The wait could be long but once you are seated the food come real fast. The portions are bigger than other izakaya. I especially enjoyed the oysters. So fresh! I'll definitely come here again for your delious izakaya food.<//Review>

<text>Be careful! I had a braised pork belly and a daikon soup over rice with salmon roe last night. The food tasted good. However, I had to wake up at 4am this morning to throw up - left a mess in my bathroom and vomit all over my clothes 🤒😔<//text>< Name>

This is hands down one of the best places for Japanese in Sunnyvale. They are only open until 1:30 for lunch and get there early and outside of popular dining times as it fills up quickly! Everything we've had is great, the service is excellent. Parking lot and restaurant are small for a place that is so popular but the couple of times I've gone have not had wait. We did have to circle the parking lot which shares a lot of spaces with the other businesses in the strip mall.

Highly recommend pretty much every dish. Sashimi is delicious and the tonkatsu and karage were the best I've had!<//text>

This was one of the first times that I went to a Japanese restaurant without the intention of getting sushi or ramen.  Believe it or not, there are other things that exist in this universe outside of those two when it comes to Japanese cuisine.

I love love LOVED Tanto.  The food was authentic, delicious and decently priced.  I went in and stared at the menu in frustration for about 10 minutes and decided it would be more fruitful to ask the waitress what she recommended.  Unlike most times when I ask this question and I get a "Uh... I guess most like like this..." she was SUPER excited about their food and gave me multiple suggestions across the menu showcasing different aspects of their cuisine.

I ended up getting the fried rice balls with salmon inside and the tempura udon.  Both were delicious, but my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach in this case since their portions were pretty hefty compared to what I expected.

Regardless, I'm very glad that I got to give both dishes a try.  This is a great restaurant if you are looking to get a true taste of Japan in the city of Sunnyvale.< /Text>

Food and service are both great here. Sashimi was fresh, plating was eye catching, and many options to choose from!

The gyu ishiyaki is also a must try! The sizzling beef in the hot stone pot has excellent flavor.<//Review>

<pictures>None<//pictures><text>My favorite Japanese place in the bay area. This isn't your standard sushi joint, but their sashimi salmon is excellent. I recommend getting one of the hot claypot dishes (I prefer beef), and then asking the server for recommendations, they are all very excellent. Any of the cheesy carbohydrate dishes would be an excellent addition.  One-to-two plates per person in your party will be more than enough food.

This place also offers an excellent selection of both hot and cold soju.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The opening hours said they close 9. With people present I walked up to door and the women speeds over and turns sign around to closed. To compound matters the other guys thought this to fun. Horrendous, with so many options there.

<text>This is a nice izakaya with excellent food.  While the sushi and sashimi is fine, the real gem is in their hot food menu.  Their fried duck breast is very juicy, packed with umami.<//text></record>

I had the gratin which was so so, and the fried onigiri which was pretty good. The plum wine chu-hai did not taste very good to me. The waiter suggested maybe the grapefruit one would be better.</Text>

<review>Tanto is an izakaya style Japanese restaurant that offers a wide selection of small plates and (of course) sake and beer to pair. Cooking methods vary from grilled, to simmered, to items served cold, but nearly everything is uniformly well-crafted and delicious. A special call-out goes to the gyutan (beef tongue) which is exceptionally remarkable. The restaurant itself is relatively small but popular, which means waiting a bit to be seated may be necessary. Prices are definitely on the high side, especially given that each plate is moderately portioned, but as long as you're not looking the stuff yourself, the quality is well worth the cost (or you could just order a bunch of onigiri to fill up).< /review>< gmapID>

<userid>106995104092230058741</userid><Text>My favorite izakaya/Japanese comfort food restaurant!

You can't go wrong with any choice. Everything else is good, but some are just amazing!

Here are some dishes I would recommend:

Ika meshi (rice stuffed in a jumbo squid) - 5 stars. You can definitely taste the "squid innard sauce", reminds me of the yellow part of the crab. I'm not a fan of giant squid because the chewy texture gets boring and no longer enjoyable after a while. However, this squid was tender, and the rice

Gyutan (salted broiled beef tongue) - 5 stars. If you are a fan of grilled beef tongue, you should give this version a try. Pieces of thinly sliced beef tongue came on a plate (not skewers) perfectly seasoned. Eat it while it's hot!

Yaki Onigiri (grilled rice ball with spicy cod row) - 4.5 stars. When rice balls are seasoned and grilled right (crispy shell and soft rice inside), it's the best. We ordered one serving first, which came with 2 rice balls. My friend mentioned "extra crispy", and they came nicely grilled on all sides. I loved it so much I ordered a second serving, which was NOT grilled as well. So if you enjoy the crunchy rice, make sure to let your waiter know.

Uni Shiso (raw uni with shiso and roasted seaweed) - 4 stars. I admit that I had doubts about wrapping uni in shiso leave. But the flavor combo is nothing I've tasted before. Here's how you do it: put the shiso on the seaweed, and put a little wasabi on the shiso, then grab one (or more) piece of uni, and roll it up. It's optional to dip it in soy sauce. Last step, breathe through your nose while you continue to chew, and enjoy!

Toro Tataki (seared fatty tuna) - 4 stars. It came with vinaigrette dressing, thinly sliced onion and cucumber, which made it a light and refreshing appetizer.

Batu kakuni (braised pork Nagasaki-style) - 4 stars. The meat is so soft and melts as soon as you put it in your mouth. It comes with some gentle mustard on the side, which pairs great with the meat and cuts down the fattiness significantly.
There's always a wait and you will walk out smelling like food, be warned.

Tip:
1) Make a reservation to avoid the wait. Try to call a few days in advance, or else you may not eat until late (after 8PM). If you call early, you can also ask to be seated at the booth instead of regular tables.
2) Parking can be a pain cuz the parking lot is quite small. There are street parking on Henderson Avenue.</Text><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

<Review>edit: went again and had a great experience. adding two stars. hoping that the bad service from a couple years ago was a fluke because the food is awesome here!

Great food but sadly terrible service. They forgot a dish and didnt own up to it. I asked somebody to check and they didnt come back. They didnt serve water as we waited with all our other dishes finished and lied that the dish was "almost done"... after another 10 minutes decided to just cancel and take the check.< /Review>< pics>

I recommend the uni shiso for uni lovers, which is exactly what it sounds like--a mound of uni and a pile of shiso leaves. Also, the mame aji nanbanzuke is really special, so I get that almost every time. Tanto has a great soju/sake list, too, at different price points, so it's a nice place to drink, too.<//text>< rate>

< Review>
This place is fantastic.  It's more of a traditional Japanese restaurant.  It doesn't focus on Sushi or even on large meals.  They have a couple hundred different entrees, but each one is small and stands alone, e.g. silken tofu soup will only be a small bowl with just silken tofu.  But that being said, every single dish I ordered was amazing.  We ordered a mixed plate of sashimi which was some of the best I've had in quite awhile.  The tempura shitakes were fried perfectly, the Silken tofu cooked perfectly while still retaining it's shape.  I just coulodn't get enough.  Definitely will be going back there.

As a side note, make a reservation or get there early, it's small with not many tables so it gets busy during dinner time.</Review>

<text>I've now been to Tanto twice and have walked away with a "meh" feeling afterward on both occasions.

Pros:
easy to get a reservation, even for a large group
consistent service
fresh sashimi
yaki onigiri

Cons:
everything else on the menu is sub-par in comparison to Gochi.

I would only come here if I desperately want izakaya and Gochi is not an option due to long lines or inability to cater to large groups.< /text><user_id>111975404822308274576< /user_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

<Review>The food is good, especially the Yaki Onigiri.  I must say that the hokke is fantastic!  The sushi is sub-par though, especially for the price.  The pressed sushi is unevenly cut and the rice is not firmly pressed.  Nonetheless, if you're in the mood for Yaki Oni and some hokke, this is a great place.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

A different kind of Japanese restaurant that doesn't specialize in Sushi.  Reminded me of Izakaya style restaurant/bars in Japan.  A huge selection of appetizers and entrées, some of which I've never even seen in Japan (and I've been there over 40 times).  Definitely worth it if you want to try something new.  The Uni over rice was delicious and so was the Mentaiko and Mountain Yam with Nori wrap.<//Text>

Update:
Recently went back to Tanto and was not super impressed. Maybe we just ordered incorrectly.

GOOD
1. At 6:30pm on a Tuesday, there were some free tables. Pleasantly surprised since I assumed it would be packed all the time.
2. Portions are on the large side. Take this into account when you order!
3. Love the yaki onigiri

BAD
1. Large portions! IMHO the upside of an izakaya is that you can order small dishes and taste a lot of different things.
2. Tempura - just not good. Not crispy and no flavor.

NOT GREAT
1. Yuan-style gindara: 2 small pieces, flavor was okay but didn't feel broiled (crispy charred edges)
2. Miso eggplant with cheese: mostly good, but a little on the salty side
==============
Tanto is a pretty legit izakaya-style restaurant.  They have a variety of Japanese food - sashimi salads, yakitori, different kinds of donburi, and "tapas" style Japanese eats.

My recommendations:

1. Uni yakimeshi. I really can't say no to uni. And add a poached egg? I'm enchanted.

2. Beef in hot stone pot. This was really cool. Kinda like bibimbap but it's just beef. Tender and flavorful. Such a good dish.

3. Salmon and ikura salad. Love the dressing. Large portion. Yum.

I wasn't a huge fan of the gyutan and duck breast. Though the duck was over cooked. And beef tongue was served slightly lukewarm.

If you're in the neighborhood, come EARLY. You don't wanna be one of those fools waiting for an hour while smelling the deliciousness that other people are enjoying.<//Review>

<Review>This is one of the few better Japanese tapas restaurants in the South Bay.  One won't find Bento boxes, sushi rolls or Teriyaki dinners here.  Instead, they offer a large variety of menu items: grilled items, salads, rice dishes, noodles, sashimi and vegetables.

Our favorites are the sashimi salad, Buta kimchi, grilled Onigiri rice balls and garlic steak.

The restaurant fills up quickly so either come early or make a reservation.<//Review>< Pics>

This is a different style of Japanese food, not sushi or the bento box style stuff. They're more like a tapas place, serving up small delicious dishes. The restaurant is really small so call ahead and reserve if you want a big table. There is a parking lot so you don't have to scramble to find parking :)

I loved the cozy and intimate setting of this restaurant. They have awesome private booths that you and your party can sit down and enjoy their meal. It would be an awesome place to just catch up and have some food and drinks. Their menu is quite extensive. They had a lot of options. They are smaller dishes so you would need to order more to fill up. The prices here are expensive but it's a japanese restaurant, so don't expect it to be cheap. I came here with a party of 3 and we called ahead for a table. It was pretty busy on a friday evening. What's great is, this place open late till 11 pm so you can enjoy a late dinner if you wanted to.

The Food: (what I noticed is the dishes come perfect for a group of three! we were able to split everything evenly :D)

Grilled Beef Tongue: YUMMY! The beef tongue was thinly sliced and that's the first time i've had it like that. But the beef was full of flavor. It had a certain richness to it plus combined with a lemon they provided with the dish, it made for a killer combo. It's the perfect savory starter.

Tako Potato: HOLY moly these are hugee! These are way bigger than what i was used to for takoyaki. but they were delicious nonetheless. It had a lot of potato in it, so it was pretty heavy for a dish. The octopus pieces were cooked perfectly and they were the right amount of chewy and firmness. I would get this dish again if you're looking a for a good filler dish.

Sashimi (18 pieces) platter: I forgot what this what called but its listed under the sashimi section and it comes with 6 different types of sashimi and 3 pieces of each type. this was such a STEAL. Because splitting this with 3 people was perfect and the cost of this dish was $22 dollars, so essentially we each paid about $7 bucks for 6 pieces of sashimi which a good deal. The sashimi pieces were wonderful, they were fresh and the fish was on point. I would definitely recommend getting this if you were in the mood for sashimi!

Yaki Onigiri or Roasted Rice Balls ( with Salmon ): Definitely can't go here without ordering some of the rice balls and it better be roasted. The dish comes with 2 rice balls that are HUGE. They are really filling because of the amount of rice that is used for this dish. So I would recommend this dish as a great filler dish! We ordered the rice ball with salmon instead of the spicy cod roe because we heard it was a better choice. I can't speak for the other choices, but the Salmon was SOOOO GOOD! It was salted so it balanced the crisp roasted rice perfectly. The flavor combination was delicious and I loved every bite of it!

Braised Pork Nagasaki style: If you loveeee fatty pork and addicting sauces than get this dish. It was AMAZING. The pork was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth. Not to mention the broth/sauce that came with this dish was one of the best things I've ever tasted. It came close to the broth/sauce used in Kunjip's braised short ribs and that was freaking amazing. I would highly recommend this dish to anyone that was pork fan, it was simply the best dish of the night.

Overall the food here was spectacular. The service was just as good. Our food came out in minutes after we had ordered. I think we only waited 2 minutes after we ordered before our first dish was served to us. It was awesome since we were so hungry! I would definitely come back again, one of the best Japanese restaurants in the bay area.</review>

Very busy restaurant with really nice Japanese food at a decent price.
You need to go in to put your name down for a table and the second time service was slow.</Review>

Tanto has the best chazuke outside of the homemade bowl my aunt used to make me when I was younger. Definitely go for the special chazuke, it comes with all the toppings (salmon, ume, salmon roe, etc.).

I love sipping on the dashi broth, especially on a cold night, and it's so fulfilling without leaving you feeling heavy. Definitely one of my favorite Japanese homestyle food. I also like the sake sashimi here and the grilled onigiri.

The servers also have more time for their customers than those at Gochi. Ambiance is nice and intimate...but it also gets very busy during dinnertime, so make reservations.</review>

Always ask for the dinner menu.  Lunch menu is very small, but they will let you order from dinner menu if you ask for it.  Sashimi salad is always good.  Uni and egg hot dish is excellent, buta kakune is great.  The anago tempura is very good too.  I like to go with a group and then order 1-2 items from each of the grilled, stewed, friend, etc sections.  Also, their desserts are yummy too.  Try the ice cream with rice powder (?), it sounds weird but it is excellent.</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I really was looking forward to Tanto since seafood in the Midwest is so depressing and I shy away from sushi at all costs there. It was a bit of a challenge to find parking since the lot was full, so we were really worried that there would be a wait, even on a Thursday night, but surprisingly we were seated immediately. Ordered the sashimi salad, which ended up being my favorite-- it really is a salad with sashimi on top- the vinaigrette was delicious, and there was a generous amount of quality sashimi. The salmon sashimi we ordered was delicious as well. The yaki onigiri came topped with large fish eggs and was crunchy on the outside, and flavorful all throughout. Grilled oysters were great. Wish I had gone with another seafood dish instead of the rice cake soup since we already had the onigiri. Solid service. The place is described as tapas style food, but it definitely isn't small plates-- good helpings.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Very authentic and fresh Japanese food. The udon soba, ebi chili, veggie tempura and pork kimchee were all delicious. The pork lettuce cups were too fatty and blad for our tastes. Would definitely go back to sample more of the extensive menu.</Text>< user_name>

This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants around Cupertino as well. The must orders are sashimi salad, ikemeshi (stuffed rice squid), uni rice, and yakionigiri. This is the closest you can get to Japan without actually flying there.<//Review>

The thick egg-wrapped eel in the set is especially delicious, the rice balls are fragrant, the fried chicken skin is delicious, the chicken is a bit old, the fried shrimp tempura is a bit mediocre, and the noodles are not bad.

The beef tongue bento is so-so but cheap.

Yaki Onigiri Set好大一份足够两个人吃了，牛舌便当没必要点的

<Text>(Translated by Google) Have the best Japanese food shop. Prior to this, my requirement for Japanese food was fresh, and this store is not only fresh, but also has many varieties, and there is no bad taste. And I really like desserts, the first dessert list, the mix of ice cream and rice cake is really outstanding. This house has been included in my invitation to come!

吃过最好的日料店。在此之前我对日料的要求就是新鲜，而这家店不但新鲜，种类还繁多，没有一道不好吃的。以及非常喜欢饭后甜点，甜点单第一条，冰淇淋以及糍粑的混搭真的很出彩。这家已经被我列入请客必来了！<//Text>< pics>
