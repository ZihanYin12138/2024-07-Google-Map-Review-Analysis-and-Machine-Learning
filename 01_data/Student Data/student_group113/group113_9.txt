Alex was a complete professional, he was informative of what services would be best for our situation and along the way educated us of potential issues that could be a problem later.  I was pleasantly surprised by his work ethic and it was quickly noticeable he had an extensive experience in pest control. This young man's positive energy made the entire process seamless and easy. Thank you so much for making a pesty problem a simple solution!</text>

<Text>Just received a refinance Termite Pest Inspection. The Inspector James was on time professional and considerate at all times. He was patient when my daughter wanted to show off her pets and professional while performing the inspection.  I've been with Dewey's affordable Pest Services for over 3 years and James carried the same outstanding quality as Dewey always shows. Thank you James and thank you Dewey!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>When we first started using Dewey we felt it was a value. They came more often. I believe it was because they came to our house to sell a promotion. But after the promotion we starting paying $90.00 a quarter. They would come out and spray around the outside of the house and yard. This would take them all of ten minutes. I wouldn't see him again for another three months. When I finally asked exactly what we are paying they confirmed their lack of value. $90.00 for three months. They will come out one time, unless you call them to come out again. Now unless you see an onslaught of insects or rodents you probably won't call them, so we are left paying $90.00 for 10 minutes of work. And of course anything like traps is extra. If they came out at least twice a quarter,  that might be a value, but unless you have a serious rodent or insect problem save your money and go to Home Depot and buy a can or raid.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Carol Ardrey Had Dewey Pest control come out and Fernando Benavidez was the employ assigned to exterminate outside the home and he found several wasp nest one extremely big that we were not aware of. He immediately to action and with concern for my dogs Fernando informed us not to allow the dogs in the back for a day. He also made an appoint to come back to re spray while he was still at the home. He was very kind and personable and did his job thoroughly because there was also a wasp nest hidden under a roof shingle we would have never seen. Thank goodness for his work ethic to do a such a great job which gave us peace of mind to know we were taken care of well even my fur babies. Thank you Dewey for hiring Fernando Benavidez an amazing employee.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
I had been with this company since 2012, Technicians are great, however the past 3 - 4  month they stopped sending the technician out on a regular schedule,  I complained each month and was promised the service I requested, but yet every month I had to call to find out when the tech was coming out. Once it had already been 6 weeks since my previous spraying.  This still continued so we canceled services all together.</Review>

I have been using Dewey for a little over a year, and have been so grateful that I haven't hand any creepy crawlies at our house. Darryl is great and is always on time, and has always helped us out with our concers about extra pests and he has such a friendly personality.  I'm so glad we use Dewey over everyone else.<//text>

<Text>The office staff is always polite and professional. I started with them because they're always willing to not only cover the house but also to cover the sheds and when necessary (due to black widows) to cover the wood fence line as well. I have stayed with them for seven years because of the technicians like Fernando. He's knowledgeable, always willing to explain things in an easy to understand way, and down right friendly. I would recommend Dewey to anyone in need of pest control services.</Text>< Pictures>

I have to say we've been very happy with Dewey Pest Control right from the start. I remember the Rep. Brian well... and this was even close to 5 Years ago.. but the reason I'm writing this Today is, the consistent Good Service we get from our Technician, Josh!! He is TOPS in our book!! He was out for a couple weeks last year & while they had a couple nice guys that did good work that did the route... we did miss our Josh! He's good at what he does, Very Knowledgeable & is Extremely personable. We feel Very well taken care of! Thanks Josh for working with us to fit Our needs in texting me when you're 10 minutes out & when you arrive so I can open the gate.

The Office personnel has always been really helpful & nice too.

I DON'T like Bugs & our bug situation when we bought our home drove me crazy!! Since we got Dewey... I can Relax now!! I'm Serious... HUGE Difference! Thanks Dewey... Thanks Josh!! And Dewey.. Please, never take Josh off our route... unless he's ready for a Promotion  of Course.. then we'd understand.< /text>

On 3/15/18, I had the pleasure of meeting the Dewey tech for the first time at my sister's house..the tech was polite and provided excellent customer service! Keep up the good work Luis Flores!! My sister's name is Corina Mclellan..

Once again..Luis came out and sprayed my sister's house and did an amazing job! Very thorough and always updates on any changes or if he sees any new bugs!  Thank you Luis for another excellent job. 11/14/2018...

Luis and Corry stopped by this morning...I met Corry for the first time ..spoke to her and was impressed with her customer service skills.  Luis as usual did an excellent job!

Glad that Bob had a table set up at our weekly Farmers Market in Helendale/Silverlakes.  Was already planning to sign up, but kept forgetting.  So, that was handy.

<text>The last time Josh came for our scheduled service he asked about problems inside the house. I told him that we had no issues... and jinxed myself. Just a couple of days later and we were feeding dry dog food to ants. ☹️  I called Josh and he came back the following day. He tracked the ants to their entrance (under furniture) and immediately took care of the issue. I’m afraid to say it out loud now, but so far, so good. I’m totally impressed with the service Josh provides to us and I would highly recommend him. 🙂</text>< rate>

We have a regular guy that comes to our house once a monthmon the name of Luis Flores.... If you are in need of a bug exterminator in the High Desert then call this guy ASAP. He's amazing and so knowledgeable in his field. I always get Bugs 101 facts from him. He's hilarious! Very professional too! Have had bad experiences with competitor companies.< /text>

I’ve been with Dewey for a couple years, mostly because I’ve been too preoccupied to change. The first year the technician was amazing. But I feel like they might have got too comfortable and just didn’t care anymore. They’d come and spray quickly—in and out in five-ish minutes. And it didn’t help with the bugs at all. They always came when I wasn’t home, so the inside never got done. I couldn’t remember my technicians name and the one time I called, the receptionist acted like it was a chore to get it for me.

I recently finally switched to Adscot pest control, and when I called Dewey to cancel they told me I needed to give them a thirty day handwritten notice.

Seriously?

They’re good for new customers, but the charm wears off.

**EDIT- I didn’t cancel because I was dissatisfied. I cancelled because I’m moving and decided to go with someone else with my new place.</review>
< Resp>
{'time': 1533846481738, 'text': "Good afternoon Mary Elizabeth.  We were disappointed to see this review and started doing research right away.  The branch manager was unaware of a recent cancellation that was due to dissatisfaction.  When someone becomes dissatisfied, he works diligently with them to resolve the issues so that the cancellation isn't necessary.  We are unable to identify your account based on your post.  If you could kindly contact the branch manager, Joseph Perez @ 760-243-2150, he would like to speak with you regarding your account.  We look forward to hearing from you."}<//Resp>

<Review>Edit: I was contacted by Martin the assistant manager and he was great! he apologized for everything (billing issues, customer service,etc.) he was my tech when I first started up service and he takes my bad experience personal. He made everything right. I received my service and we came up with a better system for billing that worked for both sides. I am now a satisfied customer thanks to Martin! 😊

bad customer service, horrible billing, they want to harrass you for payments but don't care about actually satisfying the customers needs. they cannot work with customers who work Monday thru Friday 8-5 jobs. ( no available weekend appointments ). I used to really like them when I signed up almost 4 years ago but everything has just gone down hill.</Review>< pics>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Buyers Beware!! We had no pest control issues but when we had a door to door salesman come by we thought we'd be preventative. Their services infested us with ants in our kitchen & pantry. We called them back 4 TIMES to come back & fix the issue. They never could. When we called to cancel their services they said we were part of a contract & had to pay an early cancellation fee. This is almost a year later that we are still dealing with the repercussions from their horrible customer service & exorbitant fees. They told us that our account was taken care of & zeroed out, and now months later we are getting calls from a collection agency. They are incompetent liars & are not worth doing business with. Buyers Beware!!</text>

Luis was extreamly professional and informed me of all my options and took his time and did a great job, he was very prompt and made his appointment with the time he quoted. Since Dewey has been taking care of my property I have seen very little bugs, and when I did, they were quick to to respond to my needs. I can honestly say Dewey has some great employees and I believe Luis is among the best, I highly reccomened Dewey pest control to anyone looking for great customer service, ask for Luis, He is worth it< /Text>

Field mice are an issue in this desert. When we had infestation I was given used and very dirty massive New York rat traps. We were then told to seal up any holes around the home. No folks, that's what you get paid to do. Preventative services are not a separate entity. $33 a month for 3 years is enough to get that kind of job done.< /review>

Gave them a call early on a friday, they told me that I would receive a call before the day ended from a field contractor. Never received the call. Call them back on Monday and they told me again I would receive a call before the day ended, no call. Called them on Tuesday they told me my opp was for Wensday. Still NOBODY shows up so I called back early Thursday morning. They told me the contractor was on his way, I waited till noon no contractor in sight. So I call back and cancelled. Weird thing about all this is that  there's a Dewey contractor who lives on my street. I just called it inn because I never spoken to him and I dont want to bug the man with work while he's at home.</text>

We had to rescuele an appointment because I had to work that day and we have 4 small children and the kids cannot be around the poison for 3 hrs, my wife is disabled and doesn't drive. So the guy was supposed to come yesterday but he never showed up, my wife called to find out why he didn't show up they said he called in sick and told us they set another appointment for Thursday then today while I'm at work the pest control guy shows up and starts spraying inside and out while my kids are in the house, my wife told him not to but he insisted and sprayed anyway, she told him that she doesn't have a car because I was at work and he was supposed to come Thursday and he said "no I'm here now and I'm not coming back" so now my kids are complaining of headaches and my baby has hives so now I had to take off work to rush home so I take them to the hospital.<//text>< resp>

My experience has been bad. My service was never done like it was suppose to. Which included my inside my house,outside perimeter and i paying extra for two shacks in my back yard. But the only job they would get done is my front part of the house,and if lucky the inside .my service that i payed extra for was never done and yet i was still expected to pay the full amount.< /text>< Rate>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>bad customer service from the office staff, and twice now we have had the tech show up unannounced without an appointment after telling them we did not want an appointment. the first time, we saw him and turned him away. the second time, he serviced the house (or at least left the hang tag saying he did), while no one was home- after being told we did not want the service!!!!! how can you do this and then say give me money? its like hey i did this service that you DIDNT WANT anymore, and now you owe me money. seriously? i highly DONT recommend this company, even though we had had no previous problems, i dont like being misled out of over a hundred dollars- and they are still showing a balance on my account that i had previously paid!</text>< Resp>

<Review>Dewey Pest Control is one of the best in the high Desert, one treatment and my ants were gone and if I had any issues like last week seen one water bug come into my kitchen I called Dewey and they sent out a tech the next day ( no more water bugs since) , and their pricing there almost giving it away I could not live in Victorville without Dewey Pest Control and their Top Notch Service.<//Review><name>John clark< /name><Time>1376418867302</Time>< Gmap_id>

Customer service is terrible.  After getting paid $2700,  they were suppose to come back in 2 weeks to stay again and they never did.  They do not return phone calls or follow up with clients.< /review>

Its a down to earth small town style billiards. Great for family night and kids are welcome! They do open table tabs, and have a smoking area outside. I'd definitely recommend this place!</Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

Hot Shots has seen better days. The pool tables are worn down, the carpet is coming apart and the bathrooms haven't been cleaned in a long time. The gal at the counter was very friendly and helpful.< /Text>

<Text>Inexpensive. Definitely a guy's place. There were no women at all, just a lot of guys laughing and having a good time. The beer is served in frozen glasses and it's cheap.

Did I enjoy myself? Yes. A lot! Friendly service at the bar, respectful guys, and I won every game. Lol< /Text>< resp>

<Review>Def on of the better dive bars in CA... it's got almost everything you would want in a standard chill, dive..... pool table... foosball... deers heads...low lighting... hidden coves to kick it... decently stiff drinks .... pretty good jukebox ...
What's more to need ....
oh wait .. pinball would be the capper for me :P< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Boards are well maintained and good service. If you want to spend sometime playing pool then this is the place for you which is not expensive and can have some good time with friends.<//text>

< review>
Were planning to go to downtown Sacramento me and my friends for drinks but then I thought...so I have to drive to downtown..bust my humps trying to find a parking space only to get a small corner in a cramped, over crowded and over priced bar?...Screw that. At least in this place they have all the room one can ask for, bunch of pool tables and ping pongs and affordable pitchers :)
Last time I was there the place was a little too dark (in my opinion) and it could use some TLC / touch ups but this is definitely out weighed by the affordability and the friendly staff.< /review>

Good spot for a chill place to hang out. They have a decent selection of music in the juke box. Some of their tables could use some work but it's a nice place nonetheless.</Text>

This place must be reported for racism lately. The owner of this spot is kicking out people that do not speak English only. No wonder is loosing business. I hope she can be recorded whenever she is behaving in a racist way. Thank you!< /Text>

Cute bar to say the least - it is most unique because they are open day and night and cater to an eclectic, diverse crowd.

If you're hanging out at the lake or have just come from a walk or workout- it's great and super convenient to get refreshments here.

If you want green tea and fast to order and take out. This Lovely little place is the best. I only order green tea though. I have not try any other drink. Therefore I give them 4 stars. Staff are very friendly, cool, and down to earth. Becasue most of the staff are in their 20's.</review>

<Review>We come here any chance we have because they are the only ones that sell real orange green tea,  not from orange syrup but from the orange that grows on trees. They also don't give u less tea because u order without ice (can't drink cold beverages sometimes, girls know what I mean). U can also adjust sweetness. Cash only!< /Review>< pictures>

I just recently discovered this place with a friend, and it's been an instant favorite.  I'm a huge taro enthusiast, and it's proven to be difficult finding a place that makes their taro drinks just right...and this place definitely has it down.  They actually use fresh products to make their drinks, so you dont get the nasty chalky flavor of powder or overpowering syrups.  It's quite refreshing and average priced for gourmet tea drinks.  Love it!</Review>

Make sure you have your student ID if you want their boba milk tea! you'll get a discount! I come here often with my friends to get boba. The service is usually really quick and the quality is consistent.< /Review><user_name>Nelson C.</user_name>< Pictures>

<review>I hate service in 626. They barely understand you. And they're RUDE. I called the arcade adjacent to it and they said it was already closed at 9pm. We went there anyways and it was still open... and stayed open until 1am!

Note: ARCADE OPENS UNTIL 1AM (for sat at least).

I was too into the arcade to do anything else haha. Such cute prizes and you can even have a chance to win an LV bag... which I tried to do 4 times but then wanted to kick the machine out of frustration bc I couldn't win it!

I did win a cute milk carton guy hehe. Tip: Try to grab the one with the most surface area exposed to the claw.

Oh and the basketball games toned my arms for a week.

Each claw game is $1 and each basketball a $1. However for the bball games, you gotta exchange your $$ for tokens. You can buy 1 for $1, 10 for $11 or 25 for $20!

Oh and in the same plaza, there's tastea. And a minute away, there's an half and half AND 85 degree bakery! Wooo

There's another location in Arcadia in the same plaza as dintaifung< /review>< Name>

I ordered a passionfruit green tea with crystal boba. Their crystal boba is basically clear boba which is pretty unique. I tend to switch up my order here because I haven't exactly found my perfect drink from here yet. I have tried the watermelon green tea as well and it's good. My only complaint with that is that the drink separates the juice and the foam so when you get towards the bottom, all you get is watermelon foam. The passionfruit green tea is pretty good, better than a lot of other places. Their food is also very good. The fish cakes and popcorn chicken are very tasty. The fish cakes are kind of like a mochi texture and is topped with a really good seasoning.

Tea Bar's popcorn chicken is the best, it's really crispy on the outside and full of flavor on the inside. It's better than any other place where I've tried popcorn chicken. The atmosphere is very alright. Near the cash register, there are a lot of jungle decorations with animals on the wall. However, this theme doesn't carry onto the rest of the sitting area.

That area is very plain but I enjoy sitting there. It's good for just hanging out with friends and talking. The restroom is shared with a few other stores in the same area.

It requires a key but Tea Bar's got stolen so you have to ask one of the other stores. Overall, I do enjoy coming here and would definitely come back.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Tea Bar Jungle is located in a corner of the YES plaza with Banana Bay and Tastea.  If you re thinking about trying this place, think again.  There are SO many other spots in that DB/Rowland area that offer the same menu, but with a cleaner environment and friendlier service.  The ONLY reason I even came here in the first place was to use a livingsocial deal.  I already knew my deal expired, but I only came to redeem the face value of my voucher, which i had made clear to the worker.  As I was ordering, our eyes both followed a bug that ran across the counter.  She tried to brush it off as it was nothing and continued to take my order.   She began to argue with me about using my voucher even though we already agreed that I only wanted to use the face value.   After she took my order, we went to look for a table, which was difficult.. NOT because it was packed, but because all the tables were dirty.  My friend and I just ordered a brick toast each and when they brought it out, hers was packed up to go and mine came out on a plate. Uhhh, weird.  Did they not think we were going to eat together and i just wanted her to watch me eat mine...?  Long story short, this place was a waste of time and a hazard to my health.  Way too many turnoffs in the span of 20 mins to redeem a measly $7 voucher.

Other side notes:
-Cash only
-BOGO drink with a check in on FB
-Really random promotions like 20% your order if its the month of your zodiac...? Lol Oh, but only one promo at a time.

i hate this place.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced Boba.  Right next door is a Vietnamese restaurant that makes real fruit smooties at half the price and with good boba.< /text>

<text>3 29 2019 Closed . Such a bummer. Thank you for all the pizza.
2017 They make a great Thin Crust Pizza!
And regular crust too! They are always nice and atmosphere is always clean when I pick up! Thank you!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNny9boXcoHLDKP0MRKXCXr5kQsO162Zqx7tu_m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2bf5628f825e3:0x2b75fe11ad984137< /gmapID>< Date>

<text>Visiting from out of town and chose this restaurant based on the positive google reviews. We confirm... this is an excellent pizzeria! Definitely not your fast-food commercial chain. They make the pizza with high quality, fresh ingredients, which you can instantly taste when taking that first bite. Truly delicious! In addition the staff were super friendly and made us feel right at home. 5 stars for sure! Highly recommend!</text><userid>102295294016819504204< /userid><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

< Review>
This place aroma alone brought me in. The atmosphere is great, clean, great lighting, great display of the menu. It is a bit pricy for what I'm use to paying for a lasagna, but it was so worth it. Garlic bread itself was amazing. Definitely coming back. Why I gave it a four is because the owner, the owner, made a snobby look at me. Maybe that's just how Armenian are I guess, but their lasagna, amazing!</Review>

10" Cheese Pizza for $4.99+ tax. Dine in or pick up. A lot of harsh reviews, but it was decent. Maybe its because we live very close so it stayed warm even through the cold walk.<//review>

One thyme is my life I fell in Love for the second time with a different creature. This time she said did you see the Oscar’s last night I said no off course not I was chasing waterfalls in the La La Land. She said well on Ellen the generous they dillivered big Moma’s pizza I said well good for them can you keep on talking please the voice of yours wants to save this worthless world of the Vatican.

Now turn back the clock back couple of notches me my Dear dad and my Lovely Keri from Mom’s side Mountian climber Karo Hovanessian we ordered the bread and egg deal it was scrumptious even though we got there when they had barely ordered but they gave us an acceptional service on I spend great time with my dad and my father figure.

Thank you Rosa Berthney Shahverdian for making this life worth living in and enormously great and giving me the entitlement to live in this life of a giant with my Angel StellaRosa of the Amazon’s!!</text>

FALSE ADVERTISING ALERT. Visited this place and ordered what was advertised on the cash register which stated the following: Phillycheese Steak or salad or fries & soda. Which means you get the Phillycheese and your choice between a salad or fries. Either way you get a drink. The female quickly stated that it says or soda, I explained that it says & soda and she said its a mistake sorry.<//text>

Buyer beware.. Pay with cash! I ordered pizza over the phone and two days later my card number was stolen. I called my bank and they said that the person that used my card knew my billing address and big mamas is the only place that had both my card & address. Food is great, fraud charges on my card is bad.<//text>

<text>Who doesn't like pizza? This chain of Big Mama's & Papa's Pizza found away for me to say..Me! Food wise two guests who ordered pizza devoured them. Kuddos to the pizza.
The chicken Parmigiana sandwich was too salty to enjoy & other chicken parm eater agreed..Salt mine...was the term used.
Workers were courteous but lacked training in

Don't like how the toppings are under the cheese. Pizza is reeeaaally greasy. They advertise a free large pizza after your 11th online order, but there "pizza counter" is saying I need to purchase another. I ordered 15 times and their website says I need to purchase one more. FALSE ADVERTISING, been claimed by other reviewers as well.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very rich and cheap pizzeria. The place is quiet. Very comfortable sitting both outside and inside. They are very nice. It has two unisex bathrooms that are really decent, quite clean. They have television where they play games or programs of public interest. Very happy the truth. I recommend it.

Ernie is always courteous and helpful. This is a good gas station for the city of Inglewood<//Text>

<Review>Needed a STAR smog check for car registration. Had to call three separate times to make sure the smog person would be at the station. Once I confirmed there was someone and drove there, the technician was thorough in his explanations, very friendly, seemed to go about his business efficiently, and I was out of there in 15-20 minutes like he said I would. I highly recommend their STAR smog check service at a great price. I had a coupon which they honored for less than half of what I would have paid at two other places I called.<//Review><username>H Deane Wong<//username>< Resp>

The ppl here are outrageously disrespectful and do not assume responsibility for their merchandise. A family member purchased a car charger from there that never worked and they not only cursed, yelled and still did not refund him is money or give him an exchange. The guy at the register is extremely gross and the owner is out of touch. I wish I could give no stars.<//text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I needed gear for an extended wilderness trip. Replaced rain gear, built a waterproof, layered shell, some shorts, pants and shoes for under $300, all quality stuff, well below typical retail prices. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of taking my partner there the next day. It's in a super cool repurposed industrial building. This area is worth exploring and there are no better places to view the Bay and SF skyline.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwBYS86ykJREjYwEmPQteskmQqoe6ypxWOWmfH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Shopping is typically in invitation only if you're not an employee. If you're fortunate to get one, make sure to take advantage of the invite. Great winter sports and cold weather gear.< /Text>

Selection varies by season.  for April, there were more down jackets , light rainwear, pants and shirts than winter shells. No Sorel winter boots either, but maybe that's to be expected in mid spring. Easy to get to from the highway.</Review>< Pictures>

Visited on a Sunday afternoon, 2nd day of sale, and even though we were able to purchase some items, we had a hard time looking up for our sizes (women's medium sizes to be exact). There were a variety of really good products with good discounts but sizes were broken. Not sure when or if they replenish with the same items or with different stocks once they're gone. Overall, with the provided discount and friendly staff, it was a very good experience. Oh, by the way, there was a queue for entering the premise when we got there and waited nearly if not 30 minutes to get in.<//Text>

Not open to the public. But if you are able to get an invitation it's a great place to get details on Columbia gear and related brands (Prana and Mountain hardwear). The store is oriented towards clothing rather than actual gear.< /review>

<Review>From my experience the Columbia brand discounts were less than you could get online or at the Columbia outlet stores. I was pleasantly surprised by the Prana-brand clothes available. The discount on those is pretty good, but selection is minimal. Overall, I'd skip the employee store and check out the outlets.</Review>< Pictures>

The discounts are fairly substantial on some things. The depth of inventory for an outlet store is pretty good. Yes, I know it's not an outlet store but it functions like an outlet store. However, it's not an easy place to get to. It's in a very remote area and the only thing around there is the Rosie the Riveter Museum.</text>

Fantastic, but requires an invite. Great prices on high quality outdoor clothing and equipment (tents, backpacks, sleeping bags) from Columbia, Sorel, Mountain Hardware and now Prana. A great option for some items that may not be in stock is that you can order online and have delivered at employee store pricing.<//Review>

Wonderful prices!  Selection can be on the paltry side, lots XS and XL sizes.  Go to Assemble for a quick lunch to pick up the free pass to get in.<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) A store that cannot be entered without an employee's letter of introduction. Colombia is only partially handled, and other manufacturers are also included. If you only want to see Colombia, I recommend outlet stores.

(Original)
従業員の紹介状がないと入れないストア。コロンビアの扱いは一部のみで他のメーカーも入っている。コロンビアだけをみたいのであればアウトレットをおすすめします。< /review>< pics>

Sweet little dog park.  They have a side for large dogs and small. Love that the park has toys and poop bags! Open until dusk.</review>

<text>Great park. Runs on donations. A lot of super sweet pups  Are usually here ready to play.  Most of The puppy owners are really kind great to talk to super informative about dogs stuff. Rarely have I ran into anyone that was rude or unkind not to say there isn't any.... I can think of 3 off the top of my head but other than them it's a great park and a great place.  So just a reminder if you come to the dog park please clean up after yourself and your pets it's a team effort here. It's up to all the people that use the park to care for the park so we can have a nice park.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This is a nice big park. It has separate big dog and small dog areas. Also has some nice benches and plenty of balls around and a water fountain. It is very clean (i.e. no dog 💩) which is rare. The only draw back is that the big dog area is covered in wood chips and my dog doesn't really like to run in it.< /Review>

We take our Dog to the Elm Street Dog park at least 3 times a week. There is a section for the little dogs and larger dogs. All owners care for their own dogs and everyone is friendly. There is water for the dogs and seating for people if they want. Poopoo bags are on site too and its a very clean dog park</text>

Visiting the AG area and ate at the park. Park was busy and all appeared well behaved, including the dogs! Park has fenced in areas for small and large dogs with small benches to sit on while you hang out. Check it out!</Review>

Off leash dog park with lots of room for your fur baby of any size to have romps with friends. We work off pure donations and volunteer works for maintenance n safety. So please donate time or money anytime!  ❤🐕🐾🐶</Review>

Glad I stopped by this dog park with my pup on our way out of town. The weather wasn't great so we had the whole place to ourselves. It offers more than enough space for your pooch to run around and blow off as much steam as necessary. Completely fenced in, covered in wood chips so even though it was starting to rain we didn't end up all muddy by the time we were done, water bowls available inside, as well as poop bags. There were even a ton of tennis balls laying around—just bring your dog and everything you could possibly need to get in a great game of fetch.<//Text>

It looked like there was more grass on the small dog side which would have been nice for the large dog area. However it does look like they are in the process of some landscaping so maybe that's why.</review><time>1560457907374< /time>< Rating>

The park itself is a nice place to take my dog it's convenient and close to home my dog was attack by another dog there so I really choose my times when I go there if at all. Then again I blame the owners more than a dog<//Text>

<review>One of them to maximum 3 music gear guitar stores et C. Staying in business so that guitarist like I can walk in and buy something off the shelf still. I don't mind buying things online but walking into a guitar shop is an experience in and of itself. Go there, use their services by gear, from what I can tell they sell used instruments so that they can stay afloat. I have plenty of new things too specially strings accessories and stuff like that, but these places are becoming hard to find and need the support the community so get your ass in there keep the music alive.< /review></record></dataset><record>
<Text>I have purchased many guitars from Dan and the Crew over the years.  Only one time did a used Guitar I bought have a problem... Dan had it fixed and back in my hands within a couple of days.  They are always fair... and the prices are good.   I'm glad I have a Great local music store to visit!

Keep it up!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

<text>Dan Ernst Owner of grand central music is a Scum Bag with a Capital S.
Bought a roland jx10 from him in feb 2013 said he had it professionally cleaned cause one of the keys did not respond.( shoulda took that as a sighn right there that this would go south.)
Got the roland a week later patch buttons did not work cardtridge port was busted cause he shipped the cardtridge inside of the synth and the internal battery was dead.
Talk to him about going to repair man he got upset and said his repair man pro clean it and made sure it was in running order.
Took it to repair man costed 166.00 he begrudglingly said fine send him receipt.
So rapair man did two weeks go by no response.
The owner is a bs'er and a finagler.
Do not support.
Do not trust.
Eventually we will cross paths Dan.
Thats not a threat.
Thats a promise.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80ecf0d84f9584b3:0x81f26b42baedcdb7< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My wife and I both got a haircut by Chris and Linda. Needless to say, we were anxious to get our haircut done during COVID, but this place is extremely clean, and Chris and Linda were very friendly and accommodating. We love our haircuts, received so many compliments, and will definitely be returning to Happy Cuts again.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Love my hair color, cut and keratin care with Linda- she is awesome with providing the best advice and treatments for my curly hair. Have been going for the last 9 years and the family operated business has top notch service and safety protocols during COVID.</Text>

Friendly, skilled, and courteous staff.  Moderate cost. We live quite a ways away and sometimes go to other salons because they are closet, but we always go here is we need the perfect cut.  Great place.</Text>

Very satisfied with my haircut. I was a walk in and was seen within a couple minutes, the woman who cut my hair was very friendly and the haircut was only $19.</review>

My favorite thing is I walk out with the same great haircut every time. They have 4 employees that all give great hair cuts. I used to latch on to a person when I found someone who could skillfully navigate my dome but in this place I'm comfortable walking in and waiting for whoever is next. It's so convenient to walk in. I'm usually in and out in less than 25 minutes. 6 stars!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<name>Debbie Marder< /name><review>I'm 30 and I've been seeing Kim for about 4 years. My husband and MIL saw her as well. She's fantastic, I've never been disappointed! They have the best price around for high quality work. They've recently moved to a new location, but it only adds a 3 or 4 more minutes to the drive. Completely worth it! I wouldn't go to anyone else. Highly recommend for men's and women's cuts!</review></record>

I've been a Happy Cuts customer since 2014, ever since I moved from Pennsylvania. I've tried a few other salons in the area, but never seemed to get a haircut I wanted. At Happy Cuts, however, my hairdresser Kim is always able to cut my hair exactly as I want, and every time I leave satisfied, smiling, and grateful to her. The prices for haircuts are pretty afordable, and everyone who works there is friendly and polite.</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>I went in here after reading all the good reviews, had high hopes. I go in around 1:30PM on a Monday, I see that there are only 2 stylists who already had customers, but luckily nobody else waiting so I go in, tell them I want a haircut and they tell me to have a seat. No problem. 20 minutes go by and a gentleman walks in, doesn't have an appointment either and he asks how long he has to wait. They tell him 15 minutes. I'm thinking, "Oh good it must be my turn soon then". One of the ladies finishes up, and asks me to wait for 15 more minutes and takes the gentleman after me first. Now i'm a little annoyed. Another 20 minutes go by, and the lady who took the gentleman finishes him up, cleans up, and i'm thinking "okay surely they'll take me now?". Then she just starts chatting up the other stylist while i'm there. Still. Waiting. I wait around another 5-10 minutes, they don't acknowledge me so I just walk out. Now I understand that they recommend taking appointments, and I have no problem waiting. But if they're aware that i've been waiting, takes the person who comes in after me FIRST, then that's when I have a problem. Will not be coming back here.<//Review><user>103021716683592171571< /user><rate>1<//rate><gmapID>0x808fb4349b383da7:0x7335e094727bebb8< /gmapID><Name>Elle P< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Awesome find in Cupertino! I got a trim and layers for just $25, plus I was struggling to find a salon that I really liked for a hair cut. Kim did a great job; I sure am sticking with this place. I don't need a fancy shampoo. Easy to get an appointment on a weekend (avoid weekends, the place is too packed.) They do kiddie cuts too.< /review>

Always friendly and reliable service.  Kim really knows how to cut my hair!  They moved recently from Cupertino to their new location in Saratoga, but it's still worth the drive for me.<//Review>

Excellent technique and service you would expect to find at a high end salon.  The owner is a master colorist and stylist.</text>

<text>I’ve been with Dr. Sosa for almost a year from switching over from thee most terrible pediatric dentist ever. Unlike the last dentist Dr. Sosa really cares for my sons needs and his feelings and has experience with children on the spectrum. Words can never express how thankful I am for the doctors in any field that truly show compassion and care for there patients and what that means to the patient themselves. Evan is highly sensitive and it can be more frightening for him getting teeth pulled. Dr. Sosa really does a great job with him and he no longer has these explosive anxiety attacks. Would recommend Dr. Sosa so anyone I know…she’s the best!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Check the YELP reviews. Those seem to be more accurate.
Whoever answers the phone here is so rude. If you don't have customer service experience, maybe you shouldn't be the one to deal with patients. I literally had to say, "Can I speak?" As she continued to speak over me, louder and purposefully enunciating every word. I'm not dumb, I'm a new patient that doesn't understand the process yet. We will be going elsewhere.< /review>

This office is a joke. They have a horrible admin team and are very unprofessional. They say they accept your insurance before educating themselves on what your insurance details. They will bill your insurance for services on days you weren't even there, so they can collect money. They are a fraud. If you talk to the staff the girl who answers the phone will get snippy and act like a spoiled little infant. When my insurance called to get an understanding of why they were billing for dates incorrectly the girl who "handles the situation" hung up on my insurance. Dr. Sosa finally got on the phone and admitted that they do services "without asking if that's ok" then bills insurances later instead of getting the ok first from the insurance. DONT GO HERE! Not professional at all. Also Dr. Sosa wasn't very cheerful to my child as you would think a children's dentist should. It's time for her to retire.</text>
<Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1605636983127, 'text': 'I’m sorry you were unable to schedule your child for a visit with us when you called yesterday.  By posting multiple negative reviews, you were able to express your frustration.  I am surprised however, given your low opinion of myself and my staff that you wanted to come at all.  Our office accepts more than 70 different dental insurances (and multiple plans within). HMO plans are different in that the primary (general) dentist is assigned by the insurance.  We are a specialty office and cannot be assigned as a primary provider.  That does not mean we can’t see your child.  It just means there are more steps to go through.  We strive to assist our families with understanding their plans and limitations, but by familiarizing yourself with your own plan, you can have a better understanding of requirements and benefits.'}</response>< gmap_id>

Dr Sosa is absolutely AMAZING with little kids. We have 3 boys and have had nothing but horrible experiences in the past with both regular dentists and pediatric dentists. Dr Sosa is so calm and soothing and explanatory, gentle, kind- everything you would hope and pray for in a dentist for your children. 10/10 as a family we recommend her‼️< /review>

Do not waste your time with this dentist office. The staff and dr sosa herself are rude, shady, and will make false claims with your insurance. They expect the client to do their billing for them. They will not even give you a curtesy call for a follow up. We will NOT be returning here.  Parents beware dr sosa is stern and cold to children as if she was still in the military. Not what you would expect for a pediatric dentist. Again do not waste your time and money here.< /Review>

<text>My daughter is 7 years old and I have been taking her to see Dr. Sosa since she was about 2 years old. My daughter looks forward to seeing her and feels comfortable and independent as Dr. Sosa has always taught her to go to the exam room alone like a big girl. As well as letting her pick her own flavored gloves which my daughter loves! Dr. Sosa and her staff are absolutely amazing very friendly and thorough with any findings or concerns at each visit. I have 4 kids and have gone through several dentist over the years and by far Dr. Sosa has been the best! I highly recommend her.</text>< pics>

<Text>My kids love Dr. Sosa! She was recommended to us by our orthodontist. My kids were not loving where we were before but know they love going to the dentist! They love the different flavored gloves she uses and the TV on the ceiling while they are getting work done. There are toys and books in the waiting room and a treasure box where they can pick a toy if they have any more major work done. And Kirsten the receptionist is super friendly and helpful!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My son has been going to Dr. Sosa since he was 1 year old and now he is 8.  He loves Doctor Sosa, he can't wait to see her for his 6 months cleanings!
Doctor Sosa is a wonderful dentist.  She is very professional, gentle with kids and extremely patient.  The office is very clean and has lots toys for kids to play with.
I couldn't imagine taking my son anywhere else.  I highly recommend her.< /Review>

Without going into details I had the same experience that happened to (joseph Williams)
It’s just terrible
( please don’t mislead other people with your comments on reviews if more than one person has the same experience in your office that means IT IS Trueeeee) you’re the assigned dentist this is not my first visit I was unsatisfied from day one I will be going to another dentist to fix what you have done and I will file a complaint with my insurance as well<//review>

Dr Sosa was great! Talked slow and calm to the kids, explaining what she was doing. Tv’s above the chairs for the kids to watch was a great distraction.  The office was decorated cute and has posters with info on snack foods and grams of sugar . The kids got fun bags with a brush, timer, floss, toy, etc. Both kids want to come back to this office... that’s a win for me!< /Text>

My 8 year old Daughter completely loves Dr. Sosa! We have been to Super Dentist and Western Dental which was a complete disaster with them, she was traumatized of going to the dentist until we meet Dr. Sosa. My daughter has been now coming for 3 years and always leaves completely happy even though she has gotten some intense work done. Completely recommend!!</text>

{'time': 1536854452340, 'text': 'I am so sorry you were upset by the outcome of your son\'s appointment.  I will not address publicly your specific situation except to say that every child is unique and not just one approach works with every child.  When we see a child for the first treatment visit, we sometimes have to make adjustments based on behavior.  If those adjustments are ineffective, we stop treatment, and consult with parents on other options.  It is up to parents to make the decision on how they would like to proceed.  I never get "angry" or "irate" when treating children, but if both the TV and the child are making noise and my instructions to the child are not being heard - the TV gets turned off so the child can concentrate on my voice.  As for the matter with your dental coverage and reporting a broken appointment:  the dental benefits provided to you and your child come with guidelines.  As a courtesy, we let you know ahead of time of the consequences of a broken appointment.  Again, it is up to you how you wish to proceed.'}</Resp>
<Text>DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILD HERE. It is my opinion that this dentist should not be working with pediatrics. She has zero patience with children and uses threats to get them to cooperate with her. I have an almost 7 year old son. During his procedure (which was a big procedure) he had told her numerous times that she was hurting him and she did not believe him and seemed to become irate with him. She turned the upper TV off that was above him and told him she wouldn't turn it back on because he was crying. He is almost 7, not 2. He wasn't throwing a tantrum! He was in pain and scared. So sickening that she had no compassion and was using threats on him instead of helping him. I know when I get dental work done, I usually require a lot of shots to numb the pain. I don't understand why she would get so angry.
The receptionist was not kind either. I called to reschedule my appointment because I run a home daycare and my back up had cancelled on me, therefore I could not get out of work. When I called to reschedule, the receptionist threatened to report me to my insurance for cancelling an appointment. I can understand being reported if you cancel numerous times and you become a problem for the office, but I had never cancelled an appointment on them and they didn't even know me yet.
I am now finding out from other patients that they had the same bad experience with this office as well. No one should leave their children's dentist office with a knot in their stomach for the rest of the day about the way they treated your child. Such an awful experience. We will never return here.</Text>< userid>

Miserable experience.  Take your referrals elsewhere.  It's not worth the hassle.  New crowns, which were done over 3 separate appointments in January for our 5 year old, came out within around 30 days.  Wanted 100$ to replace while pushing blame onto insurance company for only covering one per year and and us as parents for not watching to make sure he didn't eat anything sticky.  Specifically advised my wife to come see her if anything happens with the crowns and when we do we're advised it's an added fee and not her shoddy dental work.  You won't be allowed to be with your child while any procedures are done.  It's very uncomfortable but for us it was the only option.  Filing complaint with insurance provider and taking business elsewhere.  Don't risk the bad experience.  Go elsewhere.</Review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1550867245198, 'text': 'Mr. Williams:  It is unfortunate that you chose to reveal to everyone reading Yelp, Google and my Facebook page sensitive dental health information about your five-year old child.

And while I will not discuss (publicly) your child’s treatment, I will address one specific point:  Parents coming to my office ALWAYS have a choice.  At the very first visit, we review office guidelines, treatment options, and expectations.  You are obligated (as the parent or guardian) to decide if our office is right for you.

Was very anxious about bringing both boys to dentist. One has ADHD and one has a pacemaker. Both were gently taken care of by DR and treatment was very painless and easy.
My boys are already asking when their next appointment is.
Recommend her to anyone with kids.<//Review>

My family and I recently had a very negative experience with Dentist Sosa. Our 4 year old damaged a tooth about a year ago that required repair. Upon arriving at the office I was informed that I would not be allowed back with my daughter for the procedure and she permitted my wife to go begrudgingly due to her age. I was put off by this but let it slide as we have been seeing this person for about 8 years at the time. Now, that repaired tooth needs to be redone and we were told under no uncertain terms that we were not welcome to be present during the procedure. In addition to being very coarse she offered no reasoning as to why and then very passive aggressively printed up a form with her office policies and handed it to my wife and I.
Though we were put off, very upset and despite our better judgment we acquiesced as we were afraid of causing our daughter undo pain by delaying the procedure. At that point Dr. Sosa said she wasn't willing to do the procedure at that time because my Wife was visibly upset. At that point we left and will never go back. Her lack of bedside manner, lack of respect for our time and disregard for our daughter (Who wasn't about to go back without her mother at the very least) has severed a 9 year relationship.
I am of the opinion that a Pediatric dentist is a specialty that exists to cater to Children and their parents. If you don't do that you are simply a regular dentist. My 4 year old can't advocate for herself and she is scared by the very prospect of going to the dentist for a simple cleaning, much less something that is as scary to her as a broken tooth. Since Dentist Sosa took away any Utility she can actually provide as a "Pediatric" Dentist,  We will simply take our Daughter to our Family dentist or find a Pediatric Dentist that actually has our children's feelings and best interests in mind. After very little research it doesn't look like it will be hard.< /Text>

Both of my boys have been going to Dr Sosa since they were 1 year old, they are now 7 and 13!  I’ve always felt completely at ease in their office and the boys have no fear of dental work because Dr Sosa is so calm and patient.< /Text>

< review>
I have been taking my daughter here for years I think since she was 4. She is now 8. My daughter always looks forward to her visits and is happy to see the dentist. Everytime I have taken my daughter here the dentist makes sure to explain to me everything that's going on and why. Our first visit she let me come back and see what was going on. Every visit after that she takes my daughter back by herself and she enjoys it. It gives her and the dentist one on one time and really makes my daughter feel in control of her appointment and gives her time to ask the questions she wants to ask. Never once have I been upset with how they handle things I always know what is going on during the appointment and if I have questions or concerns they always take the time to explain things to me. I would highly recommend her to anyone and everyone. I really feel like she does take her time with each child and really seems to care for not only her patients but the parents as well. I also like that she tells you what will be coming up in regards to you childs dental health.< /review>

<review>You are not allowed to go back with your child. I understand to help reduce anxiety, however there should be a window or something to be able to monitor your child. Dr Sosa will patronize you when she speaks to you. I am less than impressed to say the least. Don't recommend her at all.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I've had both my kids going there for several years.  Every time I felt that the doctor was just not kind or friendly.  I didn't like not being able to go back with my kids either.  The last straw was during our last visit when my child was lectured on the proper place to spit out her gum (she spit it into the wrong trash can).< /Text>

Today we saw Dr. Rossanne Sosa located at 10715 Tierrasanta Boulevard. The visit began well with the dentist coming out to say hello to my son and beginning with a discussion about good dental care. She then examined my son's teeth and applied a fluoride varnish.

As we were discussing treatment things began going downhill. She told me I would have to wean my son from breastfeeding. When I replied that I would not do so she became defensive. She repeated information about how a cavity is formed and told me breastfeeding was the problem. I said that food causes cavities and breastmilk is food but I wasn't going to stop feeding my son. I also told her I had done some research regarding breastmilk and cavities and knew that breastmilk contains cavity fighting ingredients. She replied that if I had done research I obviously wasn't going to listen to anything she had to say. I then asked her what training she had in regards to how breastmilk affects baby teeth and she told me we were done and walked out.

Overall I felt like she didn't have respect for me as a parent. She is obviously the expert on teeth and as such should inform me about the state of my son's teeth and her suggestions on what to do about it. But as the parent I get to take in all that information and decide what to do! And she definitely didn't respect that. She didn't like that I questioned her or that I did research.

It was truly a disappointing visit.<//review>

This place is amazing. We love the care we get from Dr. Sosa and are even more amazed at how fast she works! It was difficult to find a dentist who would do fillings/crowns without putting our kid under anaesthesia. After trying out several other dentists - we found Dr. Sosa and are grateful we did</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I’ve been with Dr. Sosa for almost a year from switching over from thee most terrible pediatric dentist ever. Unlike the last dentist Dr. Sosa really cares for my sons needs and his feelings and has experience with children on the spectrum. Words can never express how thankful I am for the doctors in any field that truly show compassion and care for there patients and what that means to the patient themselves. Evan is highly sensitive and it can be more frightening for him getting teeth pulled. Dr. Sosa really does a great job with him and he no longer has these explosive anxiety attacks. Would recommend Dr. Sosa so anyone I know…she’s the best!</review>< name>

Check the YELP reviews. Those seem to be more accurate.
Whoever answers the phone here is so rude. If you don't have customer service experience, maybe you shouldn't be the one to deal with patients. I literally had to say, "Can I speak?" As she continued to speak over me, louder and purposefully enunciating every word. I'm not dumb, I'm a new patient that doesn't understand the process yet. We will be going elsewhere.< /Text>

<review>This office is a joke. They have a horrible admin team and are very unprofessional. They say they accept your insurance before educating themselves on what your insurance details. They will bill your insurance for services on days you weren't even there, so they can collect money. They are a fraud. If you talk to the staff the girl who answers the phone will get snippy and act like a spoiled little infant. When my insurance called to get an understanding of why they were billing for dates incorrectly the girl who "handles the situation" hung up on my insurance. Dr. Sosa finally got on the phone and admitted that they do services "without asking if that's ok" then bills insurances later instead of getting the ok first from the insurance. DONT GO HERE! Not professional at all. Also Dr. Sosa wasn't very cheerful to my child as you would think a children's dentist should. It's time for her to retire.<//review>< pics>

By posting multiple negative reviews, you were able to express your frustration.  I am surprised however, given your low opinion of myself and my staff that you wanted to come at all.  Our office accepts more than 70 different dental insurances (and multiple plans within). HMO plans are different in that the primary (general) dentist is assigned by the insurance.  We are a specialty office and cannot be assigned as a primary provider.  That does not mean we can’t see your child.  It just means there are more steps to go through.  We strive to assist our families with understanding their plans and limitations, but by familiarizing yourself with your own plan, you can have a better understanding of requirements and benefits.'}< /response><gmapID>0x80dbffc97711484b:0x185d076f28a963ba</gmapID></record>

<review>Dr Sosa is absolutely AMAZING with little kids. We have 3 boys and have had nothing but horrible experiences in the past with both regular dentists and pediatric dentists. Dr Sosa is so calm and soothing and explanatory, gentle, kind- everything you would hope and pray for in a dentist for your children. 10/10 as a family we recommend her‼️< /review>< Pics>

Do not waste your time with this dentist office. The staff and dr sosa herself are rude, shady, and will make false claims with your insurance. They expect the client to do their billing for them. They will not even give you a curtesy call for a follow up. We will NOT be returning here.  Parents beware dr sosa is stern and cold to children as if she was still in the military. Not what you would expect for a pediatric dentist. Again do not waste your time and money here.< /review>

My daughter is 7 years old and I have been taking her to see Dr. Sosa since she was about 2 years old. My daughter looks forward to seeing her and feels comfortable and independent as Dr. Sosa has always taught her to go to the exam room alone like a big girl. As well as letting her pick her own flavored gloves which my daughter loves! Dr. Sosa and her staff are absolutely amazing very friendly and thorough with any findings or concerns at each visit. I have 4 kids and have gone through several dentist over the years and by far Dr. Sosa has been the best! I highly recommend her.< /review>

We have been seeing Dr. Sosa for 8 years and will be so sorry to leave next year. Both our boys love her. She did a fantastic job on their braces and they were even able to come off early. Dr. Sosa is always pleasant and professional and we never have to wait for our appointment.<//text>

My son has been going to Dr. Sosa since he was 1 year old and now he is 8.  He loves Doctor Sosa, he can't wait to see her for his 6 months cleanings!
Doctor Sosa is a wonderful dentist.  She is very professional, gentle with kids and extremely patient.  The office is very clean and has lots toys for kids to play with.
I couldn't imagine taking my son anywhere else.  I highly recommend her.</text>

It’s just terrible
( please don’t mislead other people with your comments on reviews if more than one person has the same experience in your office that means IT IS Trueeeee) you’re the assigned dentist this is not my first visit I was unsatisfied from day one I will be going to another dentist to fix what you have done and I will file a complaint with my insurance as well< /Text>

Dr Sosa was great! Talked slow and calm to the kids, explaining what she was doing. Tv’s above the chairs for the kids to watch was a great distraction.  The office was decorated cute and has posters with info on snack foods and grams of sugar . The kids got fun bags with a brush, timer, floss, toy, etc. Both kids want to come back to this office... that’s a win for me!<//review>

My 8 year old Daughter completely loves Dr. Sosa! We have been to Super Dentist and Western Dental which was a complete disaster with them, she was traumatized of going to the dentist until we meet Dr. Sosa. My daughter has been now coming for 3 years and always leaves completely happy even though she has gotten some intense work done. Completely recommend!!</Text>

{'time': 1536854452340, 'text': 'I am so sorry you were upset by the outcome of your son\'s appointment.  I will not address publicly your specific situation except to say that every child is unique and not just one approach works with every child.  When we see a child for the first treatment visit, we sometimes have to make adjustments based on behavior.  If those adjustments are ineffective, we stop treatment, and consult with parents on other options.  It is up to parents to make the decision on how they would like to proceed.  I never get "angry" or "irate" when treating children, but if both the TV and the child are making noise and my instructions to the child are not being heard - the TV gets turned off so the child can concentrate on my voice.  As for the matter with your dental coverage and reporting a broken appointment:  the dental benefits provided to you and your child come with guidelines.  As a courtesy, we let you know ahead of time of the consequences of a broken appointment.  Again, it is up to you how you wish to proceed.'}<//Resp>
<Text>DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILD HERE. It is my opinion that this dentist should not be working with pediatrics. She has zero patience with children and uses threats to get them to cooperate with her. I have an almost 7 year old son. During his procedure (which was a big procedure) he had told her numerous times that she was hurting him and she did not believe him and seemed to become irate with him. She turned the upper TV off that was above him and told him she wouldn't turn it back on because he was crying. He is almost 7, not 2. He wasn't throwing a tantrum! He was in pain and scared. So sickening that she had no compassion and was using threats on him instead of helping him. I know when I get dental work done, I usually require a lot of shots to numb the pain. I don't understand why she would get so angry.
The receptionist was not kind either. I called to reschedule my appointment because I run a home daycare and my back up had cancelled on me, therefore I could not get out of work. When I called to reschedule, the receptionist threatened to report me to my insurance for cancelling an appointment. I can understand being reported if you cancel numerous times and you become a problem for the office, but I had never cancelled an appointment on them and they didn't even know me yet.
I am now finding out from other patients that they had the same bad experience with this office as well. No one should leave their children's dentist office with a knot in their stomach for the rest of the day about the way they treated your child. Such an awful experience. We will never return here.<//Text><Name>Natalie Mattazaro<//Name><user>105480687941657399828< /user>< date>

The receptionist, Kristina is always helpful and friendly. Dr. Sosa is absolutely amazing with my daughter who is 8 and has been with her since age 6. We had fillings done at age 6 and absolutely flawless. My daughter loves the dentist now that we have been seen by Dr. Sosa. Thank you Dr. Rossanne Sosa Pediatric Dentistry<//review>

<text>Miserable experience.  Take your referrals elsewhere.  It's not worth the hassle.  New crowns, which were done over 3 separate appointments in January for our 5 year old, came out within around 30 days.  Wanted 100$ to replace while pushing blame onto insurance company for only covering one per year and and us as parents for not watching to make sure he didn't eat anything sticky.  Specifically advised my wife to come see her if anything happens with the crowns and when we do we're advised it's an added fee and not her shoddy dental work.  You won't be allowed to be with your child while any procedures are done.  It's very uncomfortable but for us it was the only option.  Filing complaint with insurance provider and taking business elsewhere.  Don't risk the bad experience.  Go elsewhere.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1550867245198, 'text': 'Mr. Williams:  It is unfortunate that you chose to reveal to everyone reading Yelp, Google and my Facebook page sensitive dental health information about your five-year old child.  In one, 5-minute, telephone call with me, your anger and desire to “get me” with a cyber-bully attack superseded common sense and consideration for your child’s privacy.  And while I will not discuss (publicly) your child’s treatment, I will address one specific point:  Parents coming to my office ALWAYS have a choice.  At the very first visit, we review office guidelines, treatment options, and expectations.  You are obligated (as the parent or guardian) to decide if our office is right for you.  You will always have the option of discussing with me (at anytime during the course of treatment or otherwise) issues regarding your child’s care – privately, of course.'}<//Resp><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmap_id>

My kids have been going to Dr. Sosa since they were 1 years old. Even have gone through hoops to get back to her after our insurance changed. Wouldn't take my kids any where else. Staff is always friendly and kids can't wait to go back. What kids want to go to the dentist? That alone speaks speaks volumes.</Review>

Was very anxious about bringing both boys to dentist. One has ADHD and one has a pacemaker. Both were gently taken care of by DR and treatment was very painless and easy.
My boys are already asking when their next appointment is.

My family and I recently had a very negative experience with Dentist Sosa. Our 4 year old damaged a tooth about a year ago that required repair. Upon arriving at the office I was informed that I would not be allowed back with my daughter for the procedure and she permitted my wife to go begrudgingly due to her age. I was put off by this but let it slide as we have been seeing this person for about 8 years at the time. Now, that repaired tooth needs to be redone and we were told under no uncertain terms that we were not welcome to be present during the procedure. In addition to being very coarse she offered no reasoning as to why and then very passive aggressively printed up a form with her office policies and handed it to my wife and I.
Though we were put off, very upset and despite our better judgment we acquiesced as we were afraid of causing our daughter undo pain by delaying the procedure. At that point Dr. Sosa said she wasn't willing to do the procedure at that time because my Wife was visibly upset. At that point we left and will never go back. Her lack of bedside manner, lack of respect for our time and disregard for our daughter (Who wasn't about to go back without her mother at the very least) has severed a 9 year relationship.
I am of the opinion that a Pediatric dentist is a specialty that exists to cater to Children and their parents. If you don't do that you are simply a regular dentist. My 4 year old can't advocate for herself and she is scared by the very prospect of going to the dentist for a simple cleaning, much less something that is as scary to her as a broken tooth. Since Dentist Sosa took away any Utility she can actually provide as a "Pediatric" Dentist,  We will simply take our Daughter to our Family dentist or find a Pediatric Dentist that actually has our children's feelings and best interests in mind. After very little research it doesn't look like it will be hard.</Text>

<review>I have been taking my daughter here for years I think since she was 4. She is now 8. My daughter always looks forward to her visits and is happy to see the dentist. Everytime I have taken my daughter here the dentist makes sure to explain to me everything that's going on and why. Our first visit she let me come back and see what was going on. Every visit after that she takes my daughter back by herself and she enjoys it. It gives her and the dentist one on one time and really makes my daughter feel in control of her appointment and gives her time to ask the questions she wants to ask. Never once have I been upset with how they handle things I always know what is going on during the appointment and if I have questions or concerns they always take the time to explain things to me. I would highly recommend her to anyone and everyone. I really feel like she does take her time with each child and really seems to care for not only her patients but the parents as well. I also like that she tells you what will be coming up in regards to you childs dental health.</review>< user>

<text>You are not allowed to go back with your child. I understand to help reduce anxiety, however there should be a window or something to be able to monitor your child. Dr Sosa will patronize you when she speaks to you. I am less than impressed to say the least. Don't recommend her at all.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

A friend recommended Dr. Sosa because her son loves her. She is great with my daughter who has been going since she was three. My nieces have been seeing her for over 2 years as well. They all love going to the dentist.</text>

Today we saw Dr. Rossanne Sosa located at 10715 Tierrasanta Boulevard. The visit began well with the dentist coming out to say hello to my son and beginning with a discussion about good dental care. She then examined my son's teeth and applied a fluoride varnish.

As we were discussing treatment things began going downhill. She told me I would have to wean my son from breastfeeding. When I replied that I would not do so she became defensive. She repeated information about how a cavity is formed and told me breastfeeding was the problem. I said that food causes cavities and breastmilk is food but I wasn't going to stop feeding my son. I also told her I had done some research regarding breastmilk and cavities and knew that breastmilk contains cavity fighting ingredients. She replied that if I had done research I obviously wasn't going to listen to anything she had to say. I then asked her what training she had in regards to how breastmilk affects baby teeth and she told me we were done and walked out.

Overall I felt like she didn't have respect for me as a parent. She is obviously the expert on teeth and as such should inform me about the state of my son's teeth and her suggestions on what to do about it. But as the parent I get to take in all that information and decide what to do! And she definitely didn't respect that. She didn't like that I questioned her or that I did research.

It was truly a disappointing visit.<//Review>

Dr. Sosa physically assaulted my daughter, dragging my terrified 7 year old out of the exam room when she panicked during a cleaning. My daughters arm had nail marks and bruises the next day.
Instead of explaining herself, Dr. Sosa screamed at my daughter until my daughter was crying and hyperventilating. Worst human being ever. Read beyond the first 16 reviews on Yelp and you'll find dozens of similar experiences.< /review>

If you're looking for a dealership to buy a Nissan, Nissan of San Juan Capistrano is definitely the way to go. This dealer is large enough to have what you need but small enough to be personable. I tried several other dealers, (Irvine & LA) and they're just too big. Takes the fun out of buying a car. Also, Marco was nice and extremely helpful. Appreciate this dealership alot!< /review>

<Review>Recently leased a Nissan Leaf from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano after having a bad experience at a different dealership. I spoke with David over the phone and told him what I was looking for and how much I was willing to pay. He was able to get me the best price possible! When I showed up to the dealership David was with another customer but he quickly assigned Ashton to help me out. Ashton was amazing and answered all my questions. I definitely recommend this dealership. Ask for David or Ashton!< /Review><user>118033333426420784871< /user><response>{'time': 1621973514399, 'text': "Emmo Henriquez, we strive for 100% satisfaction, and it is great to see you had such a positive experience at Nissan Of San Juan Capistrano.

I want to give a shout out to Nissan of San Juan Capistrano for the respect and listening to my wants and needs in the right car for me. Robin the sales girl listens to me she did not pressure me into purchasing a car I did not want she listened to what I wanted and found a 2 cars in my price range that would work good for me. Marcos the sales manager he went up and beyond to help me get financed. He listened and worked with me being I have no credit and just starting to reestablish my credit. Alex the financial guy got me the lowest interest possible with the hardest of circumstances. They have been nothing but helpful since getting my car. You want the ultimate car buying experience go and speak with them. They will treat you with the respect you deserve and truly listen to your wants and what you can afford. Thanks I love my car.<//review>

<review>Never did come to a completely amicable conclusion here, so I will still recommend going elsewhere.

Final Update:
I received a call from Nissan Corporate this morning, and unfortunately they will not be able to help, as they will take the dealer's side on this.  The issue is, the dealer is communicating my concern to them incorrectly.  And even when I tried to explain to Nissan Corporate, they will defer to what the dealership is saying.  Oh well.  I cannot recommend anyone shop here for anything.  These situations are probably only going to resolve themselves with class action litigation.  Just Beware!

Update:
I received a call from the dealership saying that the scratches were fixed, along with the dents. The area that was scratched does look repaired. That's great. Unfortunately, the dents that they claimed were fixed are mostly fixed, except for the largest and most obvious one to see. Needless to say, I will be contacting Nissan corporate tomorrow, and likely filing a complaint with the Bureau of Automotive Repairs. Nobody should endure this type of runaround when they purchase a new car. I have not had my van for more than half of the time I've owned it over the last 3 weeks. This is just unacceptable. With that said, everyone at the dealership has been very nice, including Liza and Evan. I'm not sure who "Nathan" is, that the manager mentioned in his response to my review here.

I would stay away from here at all costs. They say one thing to your face, but they don't respect you at all. We purchased a brand new 2019 NV Passenger from them on April 21st. We purchased the perma plate option, for paint and exterior protection as well, because it's always nice to have extra coverage. Fast forward to today, and I have had the car at the dealership since Monday, waiting for the "sales team" to decide what they want to do with a bunch of dings and a couple of deep (to the metal) scratches. I don't understand why my vehicle's fate is in the hands of sales people, but it is. I will be calling corporate promptly, but I want everyone to know that you better keep your guard up here. Do not accept any of their sales tactics as truth.

I will edit this review as things progress. Currently, we are being helped by their customer loyalty team, after contacting corporate to get involved in the process. I still cannot recommend this dealership at all right now.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Absolutely bar none...the worst experience I've ever had at any dealership! The salesman Matt's negative  energy about his previous employer adding extra charges at signing is exactly what was done to me by them. The got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the finance team effort and energy 👏👌🙌<//review>< Date>

I am a 55-year-old woman and I have gone to the many dealerships several times to change and buy different cars during my life!  To be honest, I did not have much faith in the promises of the sellers, I always went and unfortunately most of the time I came back because of the situation without making a deal!  But, this time I am very happy that I drove 52 miles from San Diego and came here to change my car.  The staff there were very polite, kind and helpful and helped me with a lot of patience and information and finally I was able to find the car I wanted and they also paid a good price for my car. I really thank them all.  Thank you Nissan🙏❤️🌺<//Review>

I have brought my Rogue to San Juan Capistrano Nissan for all my service.  My last visit was for oil and oil filter change. When I pulled up, Angel met me at my car and immediately started the check in process! After checking the mileage, Angel expedited the paper work and I only waited about 30 minutes! Angel is very courteous and professional! He made sure I was kept informed by visiting me in the waiting area.  Thank you Angel and thank you Nissan for taking good care of me and my cars over the past 9 years!<//Review>

John Harneth did a fantastic job.  The transaction was quick and easy, and he answered all of my questions.  I have already recommended him to a friend.  My Leaf SV is fantastic.  Cheap to pay for, but doesn't feel like a cheap car.  Goes really well for a base model and has a bunch of features that work really intuitively.< /review>

Brought my car for service and was in and out within an hour. Nice to see the same faces as when I bought my car. Angel the advisor was very pleasant and Tyler (my sales person) brought me coffee in the waiting room. Every employee that walked by me and others that were waiting said hello and asked if we need anything! New GM has turned this place around!!!

Just had a great experience.  We leased a LEAF, and hammered out all the details through email.  Car was ready when promised.  We just went in, did a test drive, and filled out the necessary paperwork.  Quick and painless, as opposed to languishing at a dealership for hours dealing with price and other things.  Ashton really delivered for us.< /review>

Tyler at Nissan of San Juan Capistrano went above and beyond to take care of me and my brother. He’s the man!! He demonstrated an example for what it means to be a professional salesman. He really consulted me and wasn’t just trying to sell me a car. I appreciate everything he’s done and the work he put in to make sure I left happy!! No pressure and a very fine gentleman, everybody that needs a car come in and ask for Tyler!!!< /Text>

The price to repair my door handle on my Rogue was 450.00. So . . . I thought that was kind of silly. But the service from Tom and Mark, at the front desk, was outstanding. They were spot-on, and I appreciated it. Great guys, great service. Thanks to them both!<//review>

<Review>The service was ok, I thought most places check all the fluids when the oil gets changed, many other places I have gone have. Then when I tried to clean my windshield I had no liquid. Then come to find out when my car was in the shop someone changed the nob for headlights etc, so from after the shop to last night I was driving without break lights, I guess someone forgot to put the lever back I’m glad I wasn’t in an accident because ppl didn’t see me well. Also no one from the warranty place call me yet about the (break alert).</Review>< pictures>

<review>The experience I had here really can’t compare to any other dealership! I went to a Nissan dealership in Huntington Beach and they told me the deposit I would’ve needed to put down was x4 the amount that I ended up putting down at this dealership! They saved me from being completely scammed and were completely up front about everything which is so rare these days with sales guys at these places! I honestly can’t recommend enough - If you’re worried about getting a bad car because you don’t have credit (my situation) come to these guys they are the only ones who were about to get me a BRAND NEW 2020 car for great monthly payments!! I will definitely be going back when I’m ready to upgrade too!<//review><GmapID>0x80dcf1a519707de1:0xda7aabd62323ec94< /GmapID><resp>{'time': 1604787146224, 'text': 'Alex Carabott, we really appreciate your positive review!'}< /resp>< time>

Purchased a 2020 Nissan Rogue from David Farias and had a wonderful shopping experience. Since I knew what I was looking for, I gave him my list of vehicle requirements and he made sure each and every one of them were met. He was able to get me a great deal as well! 10/10 would definitely recommend going to David for any of your Nissan shopping needs.
Additionally, San Juan Nissan has like no wait times for service appointments !<//text>

<review>By far THE BEST car buying experience I have had!  What began as a casual browse online, I was contacted by Tyler Sherman’s team. After a few months contemplating, I reached back out. I explained my current situation - unsure of what I can qualify for as I have run into very difficult times. (As with so many during this pandemic) Tyler was reassuring, and invited me to come and view the inventory.
After having to reschedule our appointment due to work obligations, I finally made it to the lot.
Upon arrival I was greeted warmly. I was directed to Tyler and with a calm, confident greeting I expressed again my concerns and my needs. Without any hesitation he provided a tour of the cars that fit my criteria and brilliantly provided details, facts and information on each.
Took a drive in the prospective car I was looking at and once we returned, Tyler made me feel comfortable covering the next steps. Once the application was complete, the manager Ayden introduced himself, asked a few questions and went to work to qualify. As we waited, Tyler answered all of my questions with ease. I never once felt pressured, never felt the need deposit more than I felt comfortable to or agree to higher monthly terms.
Ayden returned with my approval and negotiated the terms effortlessly, assuring that I was completely satisfied with all of the terms-which I was!
Both Tyler and Ayden went above and beyond to make me not only content but absolutely thrilled about my decision to get into a great Nissan Rogue-a killer deal at that!
Thanks guys, I really appreciate it and will return along with referring anyone looking to purchase without the cliche “sales-y” experience.

An automatic five star review for Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Thank you to my salesman Juan Torres for your kindness and undivided attention to my car buying experience. Juan answered all my questions in a very honest manner, he worked closely with Jon in finance to help me get my payments that worked within my budget. And a big shout-out to Jon in finance, even after it was all said and done and I had left the dealership Jon contacted me the next day and was able to reduce my payments.Jon contacted me again 2 days later and was still continuing to work on my loan and was able to reduce my payments even more and also reduce the length of my loan. Never ever have I been to a dealership that once I left they continued to work tirelessly on my loan to reduce payments and make life just a little bit easier during these uncertain times. Thank you again Juan Torres for being my salesman I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you Jon and the finance team for all your hard work. Stay healthy and God bless Patricia Arnold.< /Review>

<review>If I could rate it 0 stars I would. Don't ever go here. They lie to you and tell you prices and then corner you. "I'll go talk to the manager" 4 times and lied every time about what was available.  We wanted the 50 dollar promotion for the test drive and was denied. Don't ever go here.< /review></record>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Would not recommend shopping here.  I inquired about a used Nissan Titan Pro-4X the have on their website for the price of $37,690.  I started to negotiate price and they said that with the dealer add ons that they could not work with price on it.  They gave me a list of the add ons, I told them to remove them, they then proceeded to tell me that the advertised price does not include the dealer add ons.  They have a disclaimer on their site that the dealer can add those add ons and to them this seems fine.  To me it's a shady way of doing business, the advertise the truck for a certain price and when you arrive they give you a higher price.  They need to be upfront and list those add ons with the price they are looking to get out of it.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I didn't end up buying the car during my visit, because I wasn't ready, but they really gave me a great experience while I was there. When I first arrived, I went to use the restroom. When I came out, David had opened up the doors, hood, trunk etc. of the car and it looked stunning when I walked out. I felt at ease here, and didn't feel pressured. Thanks so much David and Ayden!<//Review>< UserId.>

<Review>I have been paying a $12.00 ‘rider’ insurance police on my Nissan finance. It covered little things like cracked rims and lost keys.

8 months ago, I lost one of my two keys and finally went in to replace it. Although the service tech was pleasant and verbally helpful, he had to contact the claims dept. Because it was a Saturday, he could not contact them until Monday. That was a week ago. He still has not contacted me.

He did find me in the computer files. He has my address, cell phone number (and email address, I believe).

I’m planning to call him early next week with a follow-through call. If I can’t get a new key, I will cancel this rider policy. $12 per month is $144 per year and $720 total before the car is paid off!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1569359444969, 'text': 'Mark thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are going to pass the information on to Liza Howell our Customer Relationship Manager to make sure that this gets taken care of.

So much more than just good service. I was made to feel like the most important person to walk in the door.  Warm greetings, WiFi,  car washed with oil change and beverages and snacks while you wait.  My agent let me know status of my car and came for me when it was ready.  It’s funny. I’ve never enjoyed getting my car fixed but at Nissan San Juan Capistrano I do.< /text>

What you described is the type of experience one should expect when coming to a car dealership looking to do exactly what you said, SPEND THAT MONEY! If a business is ever to expect a customer to pull hard earned money out of their pocket to purchase a good or service they better get 5 star treatment from the minute they jump out of their car. On top of that, thank you for your service. Thank you for fighting for our freedom so that we all can enjoy life here in Orange County. Have a great week! -DM'}< /resp>
<Pics>None< /Pics><review>The dealership is top notch! We parked our car and were immediately greeted with a warm and pleasant greeting, as African Americans take note this is where we decide if this is sincere or one of those smiles we get only to get our money later to discover their klan members!
I assure my bros this place is legit and WARM !!! SPEND THE MONEY HERE!!!!! The car purchase process was done with the intent to save save as a Veteran they found us a better interest rate lowering our payments!
This place bought tears to this old Marine! This is how it’s suppose to be!!!!
Thank you 🙏< /review>< username>

<Text>I stopped by Nissan of San Juan Capistrano to see what they had and what I qualified for with my not too pretty credit.  I met with Lana who was very helpful and not pushy.  We looked over the inventory and decided on just the right vehicle.   Then to Ali the finance manager that also went very smooth.  Ali was friendly and professional.  I drove away in a very nice vehicle and a fair deal for my position.  Thank you both Lana and Ali it was a pleasure doing business with you and Nissan of San Juan Capistrano.< /Text></record>

I have purchased 4 trucks from Michael Shelby the fleet manager. I have found him to be an excellent resource. He has the experience and expertise you want from your dealer. There is no one else I would consider when I make a car purchase.

< Review>
One of the worst experiences I’ve ever come across not only for a car dealership but customer service prospective as well. Head sales manager attempted to hit on my partner, sold us a car which in return would have received 40,000 dollars worth of interest. Rude throw out the entire process. Just a horrible experience all around. I wouldn’t recommend this location if it was the last place to buy a car.<//Review>

I am very happy to now have a reliable, honest Nissan dealership near my home.  When I purchased my Juke, I did so from the Carson dealership which is over 50 mi away...but they promised me a good deal and delivered the best service I've ever had for a car.  I originally went to the dealership in San Juan in 2014 (they were under a different ownership at that time).  I was disappointed in their high pressure salesmen, and they actually were crooked and tryed to 'take me to the cleaners'.  My experience at Carson was a pleasant and above average experience.  I feel that way about the personnel at San Juan now, and am so happy to be able to have my car serviced close to home now.  Thank you!<//Review>

BRIAN did a great job with the whole process! Intake, communication during and prompt call to let me know my Murano was ready to go. Service was fine right first time and results thoroughly explained.</Review>

Nissan of SJC called me re: a recall for a wire harness fix. While the truck was there I ask Brian, in service, to do an oil change and tire rotation. All of the work was done in very timely fashion. When I picked up the truck, it had been cleaned up and looked like new. Nice work Nissan of SJC.< /Review>

Brian Escobar in service makes me a very happy client.  He is straightforward, honest, solution-oriented,  and makes taking my X-Terra in for ANY reason a pleasure,  and I never have to wait longer than is reasonable!<//Text>

Repairs seem to be excellent. They also turned off light on dash even though there was no explanation of what that was about. Team was slow to acknowledge me when I entered for service. Then we never received a call when the work was finished. This was our first time to your location, so I did not feel welcomed and helped very well. Repair service rep has yet to report results and or concerns  They had car for a week for major repairs, it would have been nice to have more communications.</Text>

Easy to schedule maintenance and service with their user friendly online experience. Had a scheduled appointment and was assigned a random service rep., as it was my first time there, but instead of making me wait (he was tied up with another customer), Matt Barr walked up and offered to assist me so I did not have to wait. So far the experience is good...ask for Matt Barr in service,  if that dept. is what you need.< /text>

< review>
We went there this morning to buy a Honda Civic EX 2006. The manager named Karl and Kacey were so nice to us. And we finally closed the deal with a very decent car. The car itself is still very well maintained. It was cleaned up again both the exterior and the interior. Then the porter actually drove us back home as an additional service since we hadn't bought a car insurance. Overall, this is a very recommended car dealer.. Although we didn't actually buy a Nissan. :P</review>

It’s not how a business treats you when you buy, but when you don’t buy. When a company helps to empower your decision and then respects that decision it addresses something missing from so many dealers, integrity. It’s easy to build a culture of immediate gratification, but the real value of a business isn’t the $$ they make on a deal but the loyalty they build. I don’t know what my next car purchase will be, but I will 100% visit Nissan of San Juan to start that search.<//Review>

The service department and Gary is the best there is. I literally go out of my way for their service department here because I prefer to not go anywhere else. My X-Terra is almost 11 years old, and is running perfectly thanks to this service department.

The service department at San Juan Capistrano Nissan is phenomenal! They have been keeping our daughter's Altima running the past 8 years in excellent condition. With it having over 100K and driving it back and forth from LA, we have it in for inspection regularly.  The service department keeps it safe for our daughter and giving us peace of mind.< /review>

Level of service has declined since the change in ownership - came in for their oil change special when I asked for it the service tech said he was not familiars with the specials I showed him the website and said I had to have it printed - not indicated on their page asked about their free check engine light scan and said that was not to identify what if there is any issues - quiet a joke I only drive from Anaheim since this is where I got my car but last time I drive all the way done here for poor service and to be talked to in a condensing manner. He offered a free was but made it all point to tell me it would take another hour just for the wash, I passed.<//review>

If anyone else has been subject to their bait and switch tactics (not honoring the internet advertised price or claiming the advertised car was already sold), please contact me at ruthperryman@gmail.com.  It's time to band together and stop this fraud in its tracks.

Another Nissan dealer just told me that they also try to charge you an additional $1500-$2000 over and above the advertised price for accessories they install.  This is also considered bait and switch so if this has happened to anyone please contact me.</Text>

<Text>I do not know where to start.  I came in with my truck having a loud knock/clank in the undercarriage.  A friend mentioned it might be the passenger front axle.  Dealership looked at it, couldn't find the actual issue, replaced the axle anyway (after asking me if that's what I wanted them to do; I didn't know the true cause until later).

I had a friend come take a ride with me, and after 5 min, we diagnosed the issue to be the rear differential.  Gears are completely ground down.

How on earth did someone at the dealership drive this vehicle and not notice is beyond me; there were 25mi on the trip odometer when we opened up the diff cover and discovered the damaged gears.  These gears were beyond repair and were DEFINITELY that way when the truck was in the dealerships hands.

I may never take my truck to Nissan of SJC again.  I cannot be any more disappointed, and I wish there was something more I could do than just post this review.

One star because I cannot leave zero.< /Text>< Pics>

I was told the car I wanted was already installed theft recovery, protection package and dealer warranty, etc. and these items cannot be removed. Okay, very good negotiator.

The funny thing is I got the exact same car(yes, same VIN) from another Nissan dealer who transfer this car from Nissan of San Juan Capistrano with 11k less out-the-door price, without those fancy options.

My lesson: Do your homework and ready to walk out.</Review>

Weseloh Nissan was a great experience.  My family was considering a 3rd car as we were going to have a new driver soon.  We drove to the lot and were greeted with a friendly atmosphere, not a pushy over the top sales force like we had experienced with other dealerships in the past.  Within two hours we had test driven a vehicle, looked at several different options, sat down to see what our numbers for a possible purchase might be and completed the purchase of our new vehicle.  We had never had a car deal go smoothly.  We can not thank Weseloh enough for the professionalism and service we have received.<//Review>

So totally unhappy that I would have to wait 2 1/2 hrs. to get JUST an oil change!!!! This is the second time, 1st time it was 1hr. 50 min. Do not understand what the hold up was. Gary was very nice and apologized but I WILL NOT return to your service dept. again. You need to fix the amount of time your customers spend there, SO SLOW!!!<//text>

<Review>Gary Linendoll is one of the many reasons why I always return to Weseloh Nissan.  He is extremely attentive and friendly.  His assessment of the needed repair or service have always been right on.  Unlike other garages, Gary never tries to push for any unnecessary services.  I appreciate his honesty and professionalism.   Oh yes, the waiting area is very nice and helps making time pass especially during some of the longer waits.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I have been in the auto industry for over 30 years. My family and friends usually call me to assist them when going to a dealership for a new car. My wife researched a deal for a CPR car and chose a vehicle with Nissan of San Juan Capistrano. Her sales agent was Lana Fallah (please forgive the incorrect spelling).  She gave my wife trade in value numbers and what they would offer her on the 2018 Nissan Rouge. I meet my wife at the dealership, reviewed the paperwork, and was pleasantly surprised. The numbers were clean. The offer was great. The vehicle condition and financing were perfect. I didn't have to haggle to beat the price down on the front end. Above that, Lana was great. She was straight forward, professional, caring, and respectful. So much so that I told the sales manager that my next Nissan would come from his dealership. When we got to the finance manager, Ali Fallah he didn't try to upsell to bring the price up. He showed my wife what he believed was necessary and what she was getting. There were no games, no ploys, and no tactics. Excellent service, great information Ali explained everything. This experience is how sales should be conducted and how consumers should feel. Thank you Lana & Ali Fallah. Thank you Nissan of San Juan Capistrano.< /text><UserId.>112423765697358333481<//UserId.>< Response>

Rob at Weseloh was great in helping me get my leaf. He really was very helpful in answering all my questions over the phone and in email before I even came into the dealership. Once I was there, he again answered all my questions and was very honest about things he didnt know but got the right people to answer those questions. Truly a great buying experience from him and the rest of the staff at Weseloh. I even traded in my car and got a good deal for it. Would highly recommend him and the dealership for any purchase.< /text>

Beware beware beware when you sign your car contract with them: They charged us (my mother and I) $995.00 for GAP insurance, they also told us that our credit union wouldn't go over 60 month payments on our new car. (That was a lie). We refinanced right away with our credit union, they charge $299. For GAP. I'm not sure what the average cost is for GAP but to charge that much more is a rip off to me. Now let's add more proof of WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF AT NISSAN. DAMIEN their finance manager and Jonathan (their former sales manager) were in it together and illegally changed our contact. I actually have both contracts to prove the fraud. They are crooks and should be audited.</Review>

I drove 1-1/2 hours from San Diego, only to be shocked that the price they promised on the phone and written via email was a total disinformation. The sales lady on the phone sounded polite and courteous and she confirmed both via phone and in writing that their advertised price was valid  for my case and I specifically asked if there were any hidden charges and surprises, and she strongly advised no. But when I got there, they just said she was wrong.</Text>

My daughter was searching for her very first car and what a beautiful car we found at Weseloh Nissan with the help of the greatest sales associate I have ever met, "Washington". His attitude and appreciation for assisting us was wonderful along with his thourough knowledge of the cars. The moment we walked into the dealership until we drove off with my daughter's car we received nothing but friendly,professional and timely assistance.  Thank you "Washington' for your superb service and when we need another car you and Weseloh Nissan will be our first choice ll!!!</Text>

Going to check this lady and you can go home and we will notify you, I have to ask before they checked me out what was wrong and they have to go and ask the mechanic... so pls stop responding because I have prove that you guys didn’t do a good job.... so they said I’m contradicting myself haha so that o why the dealer contacted me and apologize for not doing a good job you probably contradicting yourself for not having all the problem documented in... Nissan of Tustin did a better job diagnosis and fixed my problem.</text><time>1555484429070< /time><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Readers, I'm not sure how to rate this dealership yet, but I will update this and other social network reviews as time progresses. The experience my wife and I had 2 weeks ago in leasing a 2015 Nissan Rogue at Imperio Nissan was great. The salesman (Roy Sudip) and his boss were both friendly and helpful in working out a deal, and we love the car so far. The problem I have is with the cash back involved. The deal called for Imperio to send me a check for $1,000 as part of my trade-in, and to date that has just not happened. I have sent e-mails to Mr. Sudip twice on this matter. He responded on the first, but is no longer responding to my inquiries, leading me to believe I may have to take other actions.

As I said, I will update this as time progresses, and let everyone know the outcome. If this becomes a legal problem (hopefully not, but I'm losing hope), I certainly wouldn't want other customers to have this problem. To be fair, if Imperio resolves the problem, I will certainly revise all social media posts to reflect that and an improved rating. BTW, I have the promise of this payment in writing from Imperio; I'm not making this up.

Sincerely, Dr. Kevin Buck< /text>

Worst car buying experience I’ve ever had. I purchased a vehicle and it took them over 2 months to register the vehicle in my name as well complete and submit all paperwork for the car. Every time I called I either didn’t get an answer or they just didn’t give me the information I needed and left me wondering when I was going to get what I needed. 3 months later I got what I needed. Not good business. Totally unacceptable. The manager was pretty pushy as well. This is only my experience however I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened in the future.<//review>

Their online prices are FALSE, advertised prices are FALSE, phone prices are FALSE and emailed prices are all FALSE. Their call center people are very polite but once you get there, you'll get the real deal!
I believe most posters with 5 stars are employees or family/friends of employees trying to jack up their rating FALSELY as they lower prices FALSELY.<//review>

<text>If I could give a Zero, I would. I was treated like dirt. Showed up for an appointment and Ariana easy even there. So, I talked with the 4th person to help me. I was home and he said he would call me back after he checked on prices. Not only did he never call me back, but the next day A friend of mine who worked for Nissan called to find out what was happening and he was told about the customer relations person that she would look into it and give me a call. She never called me back either and when my friend called she said she passed it on to someone else and I should be receiving a call. 2 Days Later I did get a call asking me what my decision was and when was I coming back to choose a car. I went to Nissan in Tustin California, and they rolled out the red carpet for me they do nothing about my horrible experience with Capo dealership, and they were the kindest nicest most thorough people I've ever worked with. I didn't have time to go over my car when I pick it up so one of the salesman called me to ask when I wanted to come in to learn about all the features. they reached out to me and didn't have to. When I brought it in I was helping mediately even though it was a Saturday they were swamped. I'd only had the car for 3 days and they even rewashed it for me if you want great service and a great car, go to Nissan in Tustin and avoid Nissan Capistrano like the plague!</text>< Pics>

Do not purchase a vehicle here. Customer service is horrible. Sales Manager Jonathan Kyle is extremely unprofessional. The fact that he told me his salss member was fired is mortifying. Even after speaking with GM AK, their sales managers attitudes and unprofessionalism conitnues. Word of mouth goes a long way and i deal woth a lot of people on a daily basis. Its unfortunate for Nissan.</Review>

< Review>
I got totally taken to the cleaners by this auto dealer.  Our lease was up on a  2013 Nissan Altima and we brought it into Nissan San Juan Capistrano.  We decided we wanted to buy it.  If I hadn't wanted the car so much I wouldn't have paid the price but they kept telling me it was the lowest they could go.  Now a few months later I have to sell the car and I will loose $2500 on the price I can get for the car now compared to what I had to pay for it.  Steer clear of this auto dealer!!< /Review>

<text>Horrible customer service! Employees walk by as if there aren’t any customers waiting there, and with no offer of assistance unless you chase them down as they go to make a cup of coffee. Evan was particularly rude and should not work in the service industry. I asked him a simple question and he responded with an unprofessional attitude that was unnecessary. I should have been the one with the attitude since I was waiting 30 mins past my appointment time and I arrived early. I left and went to Nissan Irvine where they are very professional!< /text>< pics>

<Review>GO ELSEWHERE....There are several other Nissan dealerships just north of this poorly run / ethically challenged franchise!

5/7/18
I inquired into leasing for credit challenged customers online.  I was bombarded by calls from Nissan of SJC to come in as they specialize in that type of auto transaction.  I was pleased when they approved me and provided a lease contract to drive the car off the lot. The rate was very high, but I know my credit justifies paying a premium.

5/14/18
Here’s where the lack of experience and hard selling kicks in. I received a call a week after I took possession of the vehicle telling me that Nissan declined my application (I’m not in the “misleading my car purchaser” business) but I do know that responsible/ethical finance managers provide their lenders a complete application with support for a final approval before they execute a binding contract and send their customer off the lot. NOT THE CASE!  I listened to the bad news and was told they had alternative financing lined up. I was told that they have an approval with worse terms, but it was a done deal. Having spent 20 years in finance, I learned that resolving a problem was more productive than focusing on who caused the problem. I agreed to the terms and quickly drove back to the dealership to sign the new contract. Upon reviewing the contract, I realized the rate was 2% higher than I was quoted an hour earlier when they broke the bad news. I realized this outfit was no less crooked than the slimy car salesman up and down Harbor Blvd.  knowing I was had, I signed the new “binding” contract and vowed to do more research next time!  Sit tight....it get’s worse!

6/12/18
I received a call that I needed a co-signer. I laughed a bit as it was a month after they bait and switched me into the higher rate loan.  I listened to their explanation and offered to provide a larger down payment. It was a Sunday and I was told they may not have a solution until Monday. Several days passed and I received a call asking for a co-signer again.  That said...I don’t think my offer to increase the down payment was considered or noted in their system?  For the 3 weeks after I signed the 2nd contract, I received multiple declination letters in the mail from banks. I didn’t think much about it because I had finalized the car purchase. Although they were submitting my application to a plethora of banks, they never asked for my approval to run my credit over and over, nor the fact that this deal was not finalized. My credit scores plummeted and I received notification from one of my current credit card companies that my account with them was terminated due to the decline in my credit scores (I wouldn’t have known of the massive inquiries had it not been for my creditor calling me to tell me my credit line was closed).

PLEASE know this is the culture at Nissan of SJC. Review your contract, look for misrepresentations and don’t be afraid to walk from the deal. There are many other Nissan dealerships close by......I can’t imagine they all conduct business this irresponsibly!< /Review><rate>1< /rate><resp>{'time': 1530395956386, 'text': 'Pat McQueen, we truly understand your frustration and apologize for your inconvenience.

I cannot believe this place. I called ahead to ask about getting two recalls on my car fixed, they searched my VIN and told me what the recalls were and that I could come in at any time to get it fixed. I showed up the next day on Friday and after 3 hours, they tell me I have to come back to get one recall fixed. They already ordered a special part and it will be there by Tuesday. I waited until Thursday for a phone call, didnt get one, so I called them. No one would answer on the service team so I kept being rerouted to a receptionist asking where she could transfer my call. Then. I found a direct number, called them, and they said the part was on back order and they might have it in on Monday. Then sounded irritated when he said "We will call you, don't worry about calling us". So, they call me that following Tuesday, they say it is ready, I show up Wednesday and they fix the recall. They hand me a receipt and I say "do i just show this to the dmv, then?" They said "YES". I go to the dmv to renew my registration and get told I need an orange slip, all dealerships know that, so now I am playing phone tag again and no one is answering. I am in Oceanside, 45 minutes, away and all I want to know is if they can email or fax it instead of me going to them a 3rd time.. This is the worst service I have ever received and I am beyond annoyed with them.</Review>

I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle here. Once they make the sale the customer service in the sales department is nonexistent. They pass you around from person to person and can never give you a straight answer. They never call back when they say they will. This is the worst place to purchase a vehicle.<//review>

I come to Weseloh Nissan to get my 2011 Juke serviced. For this particular visit, I dropped in to get a part number. Someone hit my car and took off; fortunately, all that was done was that the fender flare had been torn off. My son works in the industry, so he was going to order the part through his work and put it on my car.

I usually deal with Dustin, Sabina and Gary Linendoll. Gary was gone that day, but John Arnold was very friendly and helpful, as well as Dustin and Sabina. As it turned out, Weseloh had the part in stock! I got my son on the phone, figured how much he could get the part for, and decided to get it at Weseloh for convenience sake. The tech assigned to the job even put it on for free! Everyone from Parts to Service could not have been more friendly or helpful with my need.</Text>

Buyers beware....if you have your own pre-approved financing for a lease buyout, don't go here! They will give you the runaround for a week, and give false purchase payoff information directly to your lender, then receive the check via FedEx, take the check to another dealership they manage (Irvine), and you will have to track it down because they didn't disclose, and will refuse to disclose all applicable taxes, title / registration costs, purchase option fees, etc.  in order for you to complete the vehicle purchase and take ownership of the leased vehicle. In their actions (which they will later justify when you complain), they will sit on your lender's check that they received from your lender, allowing you to incur finance charges, loan closing costs, etc., and there is no accountability for their sales persons mistakes. My husband actually had to go in person to get the check back from the dealership, and was then told upon arrival that the GM was in possession of the check at the Nissan of Irvine location (which he also manages). This was after the GM already knew of the escalated issue after being notified directly by Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp and me personally....

This dealership pushes the purchase option contracts, so that they can use their dealership financing (which they won't fully explain to you why because they think you don't know what they are doing). They did this with me multiple times in one day, and then on later days, even after I told them I just needed the dollar amount they needed for the purchase because I had my own financing. They think with this option, that since you have the 10 day window to then get them the payment for the vehicle, it shouldn't be an issue. When in reality, it's an extra step and unnecessary when you can just get them a check, in the amount that they need from your lender that same day so that you facilitate the purchase. The GM will tell you that you need to provide your social security number for identity purposes to complete the purchase, even if you have the payment in hand. After this incident, I checked with the DMV on the title and registration process along with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp, and there is no need for you to provide your social security number to facilitate the purchase when you have your own financing….

The whole situation was very odd and a complete waste of my time that I can never get back. Save yourself the headaches and stress and go somewhere that is fair and honest, and provides full disclosures for such a large purchase. A dealership that doesn’t discriminate when you have your own financing, or intentionally make the purchase process difficult because they are making no profit in the lease buyout transaction. Sales managers that can talk and treat you with respect, and not refuse to calculate additional purchase costs to complete the transaction at hand. A dealership with a GM that actually helps to resolve the escalated issue, with a definite solution and immediate course of action when an issue escalates to his level and when there have been so many negligent actions by his management and sales staff during your transaction request. My requested lease buyout transaction should have been very straight forward, but they over complicated it to the maximum extent, and I lost money in the process. After multiple trips, I'm just thankful we were able to get the check back from them....

In reading further reviews and doing additional research on this dealership, I see that this is not the first time there has been an issue with them placing road blocks for this type of lease buyout transaction. This dealership is under new ownership and name, with the DBA being filed in March 2017. What happened here is not okay and has been escalated to the highest level with multiple reporting bureau’s to prevent anyone else from going through this.< /Text>

Just bought 2018 nissan rogue SV (feb 26 2018). But when i went home just got the car the same day i noticed the other key fob doesn't working. I sent email or send message on the contact web but no answer. I called them they put me on hold then they hang up the call. I called again they said they will notify jake and jake should call me (thats what they said). But i didn't get any call back. I called my sales broker because i made my deal with them (car specs). They said i can change the battery by my self. I did that but still the key fob didn't work after i put new battery. To many hassel for brand new car. This is Nightmare for me. And worst experience.<//Text>

<Date>1301702517201</Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Great experience.  There was only one red stick shift Xterra within 75 miles when I was ready to buy, but when I showed up I still got a very fair price without haggling.  The finance process was clean and no hassle (especially compared to other experiences where I've had to walk out) and I managed to leave with a good deal on my car in 2 hours start to finish.

I normally think people that only take 2 hours to buy a car are getting ripped off (my last purchase took 2 weeks and 8 dealer visits to get my price), but they proved me wrong.  I did my research before I went and they came in just $300 (1%) over my target price right away (more than 10% lower than sticker).  I chose not to haggle for the extra price, but it's always nice to know that we're starting from a very reasonable number from the beginning.

I highly recommend the fair and friendly buying process at Weseloh Nissan!<//Review>< pictures>

They damaged our cargo van
We sent our company cargo van Nissan NV
To Nissan of San Juan Capistrano 33633 CaminoCapistrano, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675 On August 12th 2017 around
9:30am To fix a suspension manufacture defect , Brian from Service department called me around 4:30 to inform me that the service is done but there is an accident happened to my Van I went back to pick up my company Van and Brian and his manager Hernandez showed me a strong damage to the side of my van , and they explained that the service mechanic was testing my van and he hit my van to the wall and damaged the driver back side of the van , Brian and his manager offered me to fix the damage but they have to take the company van for about 9 business days to be fixed
> They offered me an open  truck or small van during the period of fixing my van but we are a heating and air conditioning company,so the rental van has to be same size as our van
I took our van to a three different collision centers for an estimate price to fix my van is
$5000 and it will take 15 business day to fix plus the company logo will cost $1400 plus the resale depreciation value of the van
plus renting a cargo van for three weeks $1500 I talked to Hernandez the service manager about His options to us , he said his collision center will take 9 business days to fix the van and they will charge him $300 to fix everything on the van , and Hernandz is willing to pay me $300. It is ridiculous that big of a difference
between his cost to fix and the other body shop cost.
> How can I trust Imperio Nissan to fix my van for $300
My van is 2014 cargo van has 32000 miles since day one the van has a lot of manufacture Defects, starts with the back up camera was defected also
> the van battery was defected and the front suspension was defected,also the  USB is defected and they can't fix it until now
I'm taking them to the court ,

Nissan of San Juan Capistrano are giving the wrong information, the accident happened under their new management , I have all paper work to prove that , we are in the court anyway
Don’t trust this Nissan dealer,</Review>

Rob Chianese is the man!  He and all the other associates made this a process that is not nearly as scary as I thought it would be.

<username>Cristian Ciobanu< /username><time>1473457996888<//time><rating>1< /rating><Text>Everything is great up to the point when your vehicle needs service and that's where the "fun" starts at least for my experience. I purchased 3 new vehicles from this location and for my last Nissan Murano the CVT transmission started to show failures, I took the car to the service while in the manufacturer warranty and they told me nothing was wrong with it or at least they can't read anything (after charging me for the computer reading etc..). After another 500 miles I took the car back for another review as the problem was getting worse and then of course this time they found the problem and then just to be told that I'm out of warranty now being at 61000 miles and there is nothing they can do about it. This after I've being a loyal customer and servicing my car at their location.

(Update 09/09/2016)
My experience gets even better as I took my car to a local mechanic who found a problem with a defective tube that was providing air to the engine. This piece was replaced with under $200 and all seems good with my car now where the Nissan certified professionals from this location quoted me a full replacement of the CVT transmission for 5K.
I can't imagine how these people can still be in business to rip off people that have no idea whats happening with their cars. Lesson learned and good luck to those who dare to use their services.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>My mom and I made an online appointment to test drive a used Hybrid Altima. We were greeted right away by a tall light haired older gentleman at the parking lot and asked if he could be of help. It was nice and friendly welcome. He directed us to Washington who he thought was the right person we were looking for. That was very helpful of him to do that. Washington was very professional and quick to get the keys for us to test drive. He showed us 3 other cars very patiently told us their differences and features. He was knowledgeable about the Nissans and Kia Optima.  I liked the 2010 Nissan Altima and decided to make an offer. The application process for financing was easy.  I did not get the deal I hoped for but $14/month more than my target. Signing the papers was fast after that. This car was for my son, he said it was a nice experience, I would go there again to buy another car someday.< /review>< Pictures>

I just traded my Nissan Juke to the SL_AWD. Moving out of state need a car that can handle the snow. Looking forward to having this new model. It's really amazing having the back up camera. Also, the heated seats are perfect especially because I have a bad back. Jeannine Phillips came around a second time to help me get my car deal situated. I got such a good deal!!! Thank you!!!!One Year Ago: 2011 October: My Nissan Juke is the best car I've ever driven. Thanks to Jeannine Phillips, I was able to find the perfect car for me :) It's funky and cool, fast, and economical. I can't wait to have this car for years to come. Jeannine was able to make me feel comfortable and confident the whole way through, and I left the dealership glowing! Thanks Nissan Weseloh for everything!<//Text>

An honest review means a lot to me and I think it helps any business or organization to achieve it ultimate goal. Also from the customer perspective, a review helps others to understand what they are likely to expect. Here is my review for Ocean Nissan based on my recent business with them

Sales Department
----------------

1. No one was pushy (A typical sales style that possibly most hate).

2. Right from the moment you park your car and step in, people are happy to see you and willing  to help you. Always expect a big smile from most of them.

3. Hooman Keyvan is an amazing person and man who sticks to his words.. Always a winner for me in any profession. If you want your next Nissan talk to him. A genuine person.

4. The Sales Management team is very good and would tell you what they can and what they cannot do.

Service Department
------------------

1. The service department was responsible for applying the Enviroguard and they took some time as a loaner was available.

2. They service quality was good and I am hoping to get outstanding service as I step in to get my servicing in the future done.

3. I wish they have more loaner, so that customers donot need to wait for longer to get their work done.

Dealership
-------------

1. Clean and nice ambiance.

2. I heard that the owners visit it regularly and that I am sure shows their passion in the business.

3. Good selection of vehicles to choose from.

4. Car Doc and Enviroguard are good options that not many dealerships provide.

5. They want new and existing customers to come to them and that tell me that they take pride in their service and customer.

6. Personally would have loved to see some more tea options in the waiting area.:)

Hope what I have written helps others and hope the dealership and its people exceed my expectations all the time.< /Review>

<text>I recently bought a "cream puff" of a Honda CRV-EXL (07) and dealt with Rob Chianese, the salesman. He did a terrific job, encouraged me to make the 40 mi drive down from Long Beach to see this CRV after I inquired on an internet search. EVERYthing he told me about the SUV was right on target. It was a beauty, and even though hi mileage, he worked a deal for me that included assurances (a drive train warranty - in writing!) even though it was advertised (quite appropriately) "as is".  Rob was a straight talker, no pressure, guy, and made the difference in getting me into the car that I love, in just a couple hours - test drive, lots of questions, dealing with my car insurance, etc. Oh, and thanks to his excellent deal, they threw in tax and title at the price I could afford. Amazing.  I didn't think they could or would do it at my low price offer. They found a way. So I highly recommend Rob and the dealership. If you go see him, I think you'll agree.   -    John E.

<user_name>Donna Routledge<//user_name><Review>This is my second purchase from this Dealer and both times I was VERY pleased.  I bought a pre-owned Kia Soul a year ago and traded it in yesterday for a Nissan Juke!  It was a pleasurable experience all around.  David Martinez is an excellent &quot;specialist&quot;.  He knew his product and he made me feel comfortable and I felt that he was truly there to help me make the best deal.  I wanted to keep my same car payment on the new Nissan Juke as I had on the pre-owned Kia Soul and I guess that was rather unreasonable of me.  After the back and forth between David and Bill Taylor, I was pleased with the offer and I'm only paying $95.00 more per month for a brand new vehicle!!  Weseloh Nissan makes buying a car a great experience!  They even gave me a sandwich when I said I was hungry!  I would recommend this Dealer to everyone who wants a good deal and a extra friendly experience!<//Review>< Rate>

<review>If you don't have a personal service manager for your vehicle that you trust 100%, I would like to introduce you to you Sabina Heineman. She is THE most trustworthy service manager in the industry. She makes recommendations for her customers as if their vehicle were her own, never recommends unnecessary services, and is honest and thorough, every detail is taken care of. She is friendly, sincere, asks about our other family members (remembers everyone's names!) and is simply a good person that looks out for your best interest. You will never feel like she's trying to "sell" you something, you will feel like she's making sure everything is taken care of as quickly, inexpensively and thoroughly as possible. She applies any discounts available, without you having to ask, offers a shuttle or free rental car services (the rental car counter is literally a few feet from her desk, how convenient!) for major services to your vehicle so you're not out for a day or having to arrange for someone to drop you off/come pick you up, and keeps you up to date if there is a new findings with your vehicle during servicing (I recommend replacing this - our technician found that it is damaged/needs replacing.) I LOVE that she simply says "I recommend" rather than "do you want us to" - I have no idea what a car needs, and when other dealers ask you if you want to pay for something, you feel like they are trying to make an extra buck, while Sabina tells it to you like it is. She serviced my previous Nissan (1991 Hardbody) when it was 18 years old, and told me truthfully "this is damaged, but replacing it will cost (X amount) and nothing bad will happen if you wait in it or just ignore it - it will just make noise" - then left it up to me. She saved me $1800 for a service I would have done with another dealer worried my truck would fall apart if I did not replace the part. Honesty, integrity, and sincerity - Sabina is the best. We take our 370Z to her to be pampered, and after being disappointed by countless other dealerships servicing my Toyota truck (literally 4 other Toyota dealerships who tried to sell me services that the next one said were unnecessary, and having repairs cost way more than quoted without any communication from my service manager there, the leaving me with a feeling of distrust), I began taking my TOYOTA to Sabina at Weseloh Nissan. She said they will service ALL makes and models!! She took extra time to call the Toyota dealership, make sure she had all the info as to what services were factory recommended for my milage and vehicle use (we use 4WD a lot in Big Bear and Mammoth (yay!), then made sure they had all the specific  tools to service my specific model, then even went down the street to Toyota for the parts they needed without a markup! Awesome! In summary, Sabina is the best, you will love her, appreciate her, and be surprised that you finally found a services manager you really trust. Thanks, Sabina!!</review>< rate>

Horrible service.

I call to schedule a service and I am told to show up the coming Saturday before 2.00pm, and I am scheduled for 2.00pm. I do that: the coming Saturday I drive 45 minutes to get there and the service guy says there there is no service scheduled for me, that service is going to close soon and all I can do is leave.

Clearly the guy could not care less.

It's the second time in 1 year that these guys do something like this to me: obviously they will never see me or any of my friends again.</text>
