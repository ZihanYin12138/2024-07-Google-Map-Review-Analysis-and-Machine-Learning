I have told my colleagues and I hope to come back. With the competent personnel they have, you will enjoy your time. I visited this barbershop, which brought quality and style while relaxing in comfort. In the environment of relaxation, welcoming faces welcome you as you enjoy your experience. This place is something I highly recommend to everyone!</text>

Exceptional Gentleman! Freshest fades I've ever received in my life. Noah is amazing. The shop has is friendly, welcoming, and each cut is a work of art. These guys really take pride in their work and you come out feeling like a million bucks each time. My go to barbershop in San Diego every time.< /text>

<text>It's difficult to find a good barber especially while traveling and not always worth the risk in my opinion. However, Omar from The Barberia Barber Shop hooked me up! I even rescheduled another appointment with him before heading back home. The online scheduling makes everything easy and convenient. If I still lived in SD, this would definitely be my go-to barber!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>The Barberos! Great place to come get a cut/trim/shave. Always help keep me looking good. I personally come monthly. It's a fun place with awesome people working. You're not just another head here they make you feel special. I highly recommend Omar, he is an awesome person with Golden hands. Is very hard to find a good barber this days.<//Text>< user_name>

Finally Omar has his own shop. He was my barber for over a year when I lived in Serra Mesa. He was always fast and professional. My cuts always looked fresh and clean. He will give you recommendations on what looks good and ask your preferences. It got to the point where I could sit in he chair and he would remember my cut. I definitely recommend giving this shop a visit if you are looking for. Fresh cut in San Diego.</text>

<text>The barber takes his time to listen to your instructions as to how you want your haircut or beard trim. He's very friendly & the conversation is intelligent & funny, & if he likes you he'll offer you a beer while he does his barberin' thing. Best beard trim I've ever had, & I'm picky af.</text></record></dataset><record>

My military experience has taken me all over the world. Looking for a good barber is tough sometimes. I was fortunate to find Omar through a family member and hands down can say I will never go to another barber in San Diego. Flexible, customer service and overall satisfaction every time I get my haircut. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good cut.</review>

Noah has been cutting my hair for over 2 years now. When I found out he was moving to a new North Park shop I was ecstatic! Noah is a fantastic barber and gives clean lines and fades! The new shop is clean, fits the neighborhood and feels like you're in a friend's living room kicking it. If you're looking for a new barber it's a must try!</Review>

I am from Massachusetts and here on a short vacation. It's always a little scary going to get your haircut from someone you've never had cut your hair before. From the second I walked in, I felt like I had been a long-time client. Great shop, great haircut and even better people. Hands down one of the best cuts I have ever had. You'd be a fool to walk by this place to go somewhere else.</review>

Been getting my hair cut by Omar for a few months now and I am very picky. However his patience and ability to listen has gotten us into perfect sync when I get my regular cut from him! Thank you Omar for loving what you do.</Review>

Took my fiancée and her best friend to get their nails done this morning for our wedding by the time they were done my fiancée nail polish has already started to peel off of her nails. They also got a pedicure and the man has cut my fiancée on her right side of the ankle. It’s expensive and poor quality service I do not recommend anyone to go over there it’s a waste of money.< /Review>

My cousin came here on a Sunday and the end results are depicted in the photos. The nail polish was applied in a rush causing it start peeling. She asked to have it fixed however, the tech mentioned that she could just apply another coat of nail polish at home. The job was done in a rush and they kept injuring her fingers. She spent $39.00 on a regular pedicure and acrylic nails. Did I mention that the male took someone's tip? What kind of establishment is this? I would much rather take my business elsewhere.</text>

<Review>Went there for just a color fix since the top coat was peeling. They guy  said he could do exactly what was already done, even the loose glitter. When it came to it, he argued with me over the glitter, gave me a ugly gold ombre and charged me for a full set, arguing  with me in front of a salon  full of people. I had to go to a second salon in the same day to fix what he did. Never going back.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures>< date>

<Review>I went today around 1 pm they attended my mom first. I was next to do my nails but I decided to go to the bathroom I was thinking that the guy from the window was going to wait for me. No he decided to help someone else. After 30 min he helps me, he starts to put the acrylic nails, he starts to cut my nails to the shape I want. The shape I asked for were OVAL. He decided to shape whatever, they are all UGLY. I had gone to wash my hands when I come back for him to finish my nails he was attending another client. Another lady finished the job but neither she did them great. I had asked for CHROME ( they  didnt tel me that they charge $15 more just for chrome)  she couldnt do it because she was on the phone with another person. Its the first time that anything like that happens to me. I will be going back tomorrow morning for them to fix them correctly.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd35cf467119c3:0x24ca94b5d4d095b8< /gmapID></record>

<review>I hadn’t been there for quite sometime and decided to go back and give them another chance, well that was a mistake. Henry was cutting down my nails and another customer can in well he asked what services did she need and she told him and then she stated she had made an appointment with him at 4 well it was 4 but he had started attending me before she arrived well he looks at me and says sorry I can’t help you I have an appointment, really??? You just found out you had an appointment and your going to ask me to get up and move and not finish what you started because of your appointment?? Well he sure did then as I’m waiting for someone else to become available another customer walks in who had complained about her polish chipping already when she had just got them done the day prior well the gentleman that was helping my daughter became available I thought he was going to help me and finish with me well I was wrong again they took in the customer that came in after me and ask brought it to their attention that I still needed to be attended to and Henry and the other guy that sits by the window said yes your next, after waiting for an hour and very disappointed with the customer service I was given finally David help me and took care of me. David was professional and did a good job but I don’t think I’ll be back there ever again after the way I was treated. I felt like they didn’t care about new customers.<//review><GmapID>0x80dd35cf467119c3:0x24ca94b5d4d095b8<//GmapID><user>100718203690060257759< /user><rate>1< /rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

<Text>Come here to get a pedicure with Cindy but sure enough she wasn't there so I got a new guy that did my pedicure. This was a horrible mistake he was rough not only did he cut me he cut me 3 times omg I wanted to cry. The girls that work here saw me struggle with the pain and came to the rescue literally finishing his job. Keep in mind he was just staring the whole time, why hire someone that doesn't know what they are doing! Once done they told he will paint my nails I said that fine I know your busy. I was wrong again he would squeeze the places where he cut me to paint my nail omg I couldn't I just said can I wait for someone because you dont know what your doing. I posted pictures just for your convenience<//Text>< Rating>

Bad experience my nails were made by a man, he made it so fast that he left them ugly and very bad, he left them acrylic under the nails and he did not paint them well he left me some shorter than others< /review>

< Review>
They close 20 minutes earlier than what they have posted. They are rude and impatient. They don't like it when you tell them you don't like something they have done. And even if you go in just to get your eyebrows done, they will make you wait til they are done with a manicure or pedicure before asissting you.<//Review>

Extremely rude service on behalf of the owner. Will never recommend to anyone nor return again. There is No point in making an appointment- owner decides if he wants to respect it or send you to someone else even after already waiting over an hour and he set up the appointment. He Yelled at me in front of clients - this man should not provide customer service he is a complete incompetent jerk! Save your money and go somewhere that respects and appreciates their clients< /review>

Update: The everyday drink special keeps me coming back. Large beer and large hot sake 7.95. New menu just came out which lowered some prices and added items. The rest still applies. Stopped in for lunch and sat at the bar. They always give you a nice greeting. I've had the scallops rolls which have Amazing flavor and texture. It's cool watching the chefs prepare dishes right in front of you. They are friendly and answered all my questions. Clean with great family friendly service. I notice a lot of regular customers keep coming back. I highly recommend you try it.</Text>

My friends wanted to eat sushi, I am not much of a sushi guy, I believe I had only eaten sushi once before. I was very surprised, I found some things that Zi really liked. The California roll and the spicy tuna roll were excellent. The rice with the fish made it very edible, I really enjoyed it. Sansui Sushi has a fun chief, he was great with s knife. He made everything to order and it was fast. Do yourself a favor, stop in and have some Sansui Sushi.<//Text>

Amazing hole-in-the-wall sushi spot! A few of us went in about an hour before closing (I know extremely rude), but we've always wanted to try out this spot. Their specialty rolls are super flavorful and the soft-shell crab that they had us try was delicious! Location isn't ideal, but do not let that stop you from coming in! Elsinorians should definitely check them out!<//Review>

Been here many times over the last 30 months. Food is EXCELLENT and reasonably priced. Since the remodel, the ambiance is more open and friendly. I am more of a fork & California roll person but the rest of my family runs the gamut from reasonably to very adventurous (eel, gross) and they all enjoy the many choices for lunch or dinner. It is so nice to find such a great selection that is reasonably priced and family friendly tucked away in a corner of Lake Elsinore.</review>

First time and we enjoyed everything we ate. Very fresh. Loved the fresh wasabi. Tuna hand roll, salmon and hamachi were very good. The blue dolphin tuna melts in your mouth. We will be back.<//Text>

I was in town visiting my best friend and was craving a California roll and a tempura salmon roll. Jessica said they could customize my order and sure enough they did! The chef did an EXCELLENT job! Also, the service is exquisite! Jessisca REALLY makes a difference in providing a friendly and customer centered experience. She's just the kindest and most patient person. She'll also help you decide what is good if you're not familiar with the variety.  Oh yea, the prices are VERY VERY reasonable! Cant wait to visit my bestie again just so I can grab some more rolls! 😍😍😍<//review>

I really want to support local, but is this place still open for business?

I've tried calling the number to order take out, and it NEVER connects... (happened twice now, different day and time) :(<//Text>

<text>Went there about a year ago for lunch. There was myself and one other table with about 7 people. The rest of the place was empty. I ordered a simple plate of sushi. Ended up waiting about 2 hours for it. The whole time the server was focused 100% on the other table with the 7 people. About an hour into my waiting I wanted to leave but I thought to myself "I've been here this long, couldn't be much longer". How wrong was I. Food was good, but I was so frustrated I couldn't even enjoy it. Needless to say I haven't been back since.< /text>< GmapID>

This restaurant is under new management, the service was awful, one waitress for the entire place and it was packed.  Prices are higher and the food is less.  Will never return and it used to be one of my favorite 🤷😒< /Review>

<Review>Never going again.
My family goes here because it's local. Mom and pop place, we like to promote small business. We LOVE sushi.
My husband likes to sit at the bar and watch, and will chat with the chef.
The last couple times we've gone, the chef has commented on my weight.
This time, he explained no one should need more than one roll to be full.
We usually order several rolls, then we all share. My husband stopped eating as soon as the discussion started. He is sensitive about his weight even though he is not heavy. He asked for his second roll to be boxed. My daughter doesn't have a weight problem, and loves sushi. Going out is a special treat. She asked that her second roll be boxed. I tried to salvage the experience for my family by telling them the sushi would be good for lunch tomorrow, etc.
I wanted to try the pan fried noodle, and was encouraging the others to try it.  When I was able to sample it, even after eating a roll, the chef laughed at me, shaking his head in disbelief. I had the rest of the dish boxed.

We aren't going back.
Eating out is supposed to be a relaxing and fun experience, not one where you are being judged and openly ridiculed by the person to whom you are handing your money.< /Review>< name>

<review>Took family here for sinner one night. Ordered the kids chicken teriyaki, and some rolls for the hubby and I... Ordered one of the specialty rolls because it was advertised to come with cilantro.. and hubby LOVES cilantro. I ordered some roll with yellowtail, which came out warm to the touch. Hubby's order came out and it was missing his particular ingredient, cilantro. When we asked the chef (owner) about this he said the grocery store was out... Hmm... That's when we gladly said we would go run out and pick some up to complete the roll.. Server (also owner, husband and wife team) comes back to ask if everything was okay. Obviously it was not. We did not touch the roll, as it was not what we were expecting. She takes it back rather rudely. The rest of our meal we were mad-dogged by the wife, making for a very uncomfortable dining experience. Now comes the bill... Much to our surprise, the roll that was untouched, has not been removed. We paid and left. Never again will we come to this establishment. Very rude management.< /review>< pics>

I've lived in the area for over decade, but had never been to Sansui until this week. Can't believe I've had this as an option..... I'll be making up for lost time. #LasVegasRoll<//text>

<text>DON"T Give them your business! Awful Service! Awful customer service! Awful business. IT'S A SCAM! They were supposed to do a CLEAN DEEP and before the guy even left my house the carpet was EXACTLY the same way. Dirty and Dry. I called the office and they requested that I send them photos. I did. I even sent them video. The owner, Robert, called me after two hours and started to accuse me, saying it is my fault that my carpet has washable markers and dark stains, and that it wasn't their fault. CAN YOU IMAGINE? He said that the guy from his company did a great job. Please, take a look at the photos and tell me if you think he did a wonderful job. I paid him $180  CASH before I inspected the home. I believed all the good reviews they had. NEVER DO THAT. I agree with the previous bad reviews. THEY DON"T CLEAN YOUR CARPET. They just vacuum it. THEY ARE WASHABLE MARKERS. UPDATE: I bought a washing Machine for my carpet and SURPRISE! It got rid of all the "Permanent" Markers!< /text>< Resp>
{'time': 1606237051259, 'text': 'Thank you Beta for your comment. We reached out several times and tried to explain in our nicest efforts, that the yellow, red, green and blue   markers would be an area of concern for us as they usually are perminant! These stains from the day care have made the carpet alsmost impossible to completley rid of every color stain and there were hudreds when we started. We removed most and the few that are left behind might take some extra care and maintienance in the future. Upkeep is how you maintian carpets and the cleaniness and the bright appereance. We offer and belive that high frequency cleanings are the way to go. After the carpets have been marked hundreds of times they are considered areas of concern and should not normally be able to look new again, by anyone or anyway.\nWe stand by our work 100% always have and we always will!'}</Resp>

This was my first time using a carpet cleaning service and it was great! I will never buy a home carpet cleaner now that I see how quick and cost effective it is to use Eco Clean. One hour and $149 and my whole house was done! Wow. I'll never do carpet cleaning myself again. And my carpet got so much cleaner than when I've a carpet cleaner on my own. The tech was super nice, he explained everything in easy terms and repeated the important stuff, which was good because I tend to forget. The scent didn't bother me, and I'm very sensitive to smells, but it was just a pleasant, clean smell. I'll definitely be using EcoClean again. (I found them on a Facebook ad and don't know these people from Adam.)< /review>

Marked "Filthy Traffic area" there isn't anything filthy in my home, he marked that because he knew I was unhappy with the soaking of my carpet.  It took two days to dry.  I paid $149.00  For deep cleaning, there was no cleaning!
Luckily my carpet wasn't dirty!  Although I can see some streaking.

UNPROFESSIONAL.  UNRESPONSIVE.  UNETHICAL.  POOR QUALITY.
Don't use these people unless you want your house damaged and the owner Cary to be unprofessional and unresponsive in resolving the matter!  Her employee wrapped hoses around a corner wall and chipped my (NEW!) paint down to the drywall.  Cary failed to return a half dozen phone calls and four emails with pics of the damage for over three weeks!  Per chance, I caught her answering the main line today and she finally had to speak with me.  She admitted to receiving all the messages, but "has been busy".  AKA a poor business woman who does not value her customers.  She failed to take responsibility for her employee's actions.  The resolution offered:  buy another service (because the first was so good! not!) and she'll throw in Scotchgarde.
YOU WILL NOT be happy with this company or it's employees and owner.</review>

ECO Clean came out and absolutely restored my carpet! I didn't think they could make these carpets look this good. We used to run a daycare in the home, also had a dog and these carpets have seen better days. I haven't had the carpets cleaned since the daycare moved out of the home and WOW, ECO Clean really did a great job. Rafe was so professional from the get-go, he offered to make things easy for me so I didn't have to move all of my furniture around. He was very friendly and helpful and gave me lots of good information about what else I could get cleaned by ECO clean. He worked hard and got the carpets cleaned fast, while at the same time making sure it was done right. Great work!!<//review>

It's extremely hard to guarantee arrival times and that's why we ask for a 2-hour window of time to show up. Yes, the first appointment of the day is a great way to assure 99% of the time we show up right at 9am. However sometimes we have to make stops before the first appointment, chemicals or specialty tool, things needed for the day’s work.\nI apologize for this happening and it making your work day harder on you!

< review>
Update aftwr getting a family member to come over a wait till they arrived: Do not use this business for carpet service. It did nothing for my carpets. I did the deep treatment clean they offer for $99 for some recent stains in the carpet. No Groupon or anything. Gave no results other than a vacuumed looking room. Absolutely zero stains were lifted. Not happy with this place. Plus they had to move my appointment that I already chanfed work to accomdate for. Dont recommend this place at all. There went $99.

Orginal:
Asked for the first appointment of the day due to work. I pushed my work schedule and everything for me to get to work and they "rerouted" my guy to a different spot first. Not happy. I planned my whole day around them a week in advance. In NOT HAPPY.< /review>

Great Experience with my carpets, tile and grout. Grout is nice and clean. Was very careful with setting up equipment around landscaping and making sure everything was done nice. Will continue to use Eco Clean for all floor needs.< /text>

It was your first time so we were happy to make you happy.\nWhen the carpets are in really bad condidtion and you request a deeper cleaning than Groupon, we have asked that you call us directly so that we can offer you the very best price. Instead you booked online with a voucher for a light cleaning. In this case we would expect you to know there will be an additional charge when you ask for additonal services.\nWe also know that price is important and that being the back bone of our company.\nWe hope you call us before scheduling in the future and we are Happy to offer prices starting at $159 for a 2 story home with stairs inlcuded like we do on over 11k homes a year.\nThank you for the feedback.'}</Resp>< Review>
Very bad experience with communication of pricing. I was told my total for cleaning was one price and after cleaning I was given an extra $125 on top of the $109 I had already paid. I clearly stated, I would take the additional services if it was just $15 more than what I paid already. The cleaner agreed. The cleaner did not communicate that what I needed to pay was in addition to what I had already paid. I am so disappointed with the attempt to get more money out of the customer. Customer service and communication is one of the staples of a business. I then called to speak with upper management about the concern and was told since I am not a continuous customer they can not do anything about it. Wow! This was my second time using them. The first person that came out did an awesome job and provided me with deals and pricing for the service I wanted. Silly me to think I would get the same level of service again. I now will not be a frequent customer. And will make sure people know how poorly I was treated when trying to resolve a miscommunication on their employee’s part. Why would I even think that I would pay twice the cost of what I paid the previous time. Such an attempt to trick a customer is simply despicable.  I will also report to better business bureau the blatant disregard for customer and attempt to stick it to customer because the service was already done. I live to do right by others. I decided to give them a check anyway as I was so upset I needed to get him out of my site. It’s definitely a sad situation when you are looking for good companies with good people providing quality services and you get someone trying to pull one over on you.</Review>

We had eco clean come out and shampoo some really dirty carpets and they were able to clean them very well with their non toxic pet friendly cleaners. The technician was friendly, took pride in his work and was very communicative about his timing. We will definitely use Eco Clean next time.< /review>

Service was decent, except for one neglected small sticky patch.  I liked that there was no chemical smell afterwards.  My only big problem was that we were charged a different price from what was quoted on the phone. I read other reviews on this forum where this was the complaint. My husband was upsold on the day of service and charged $50 more. The tech claimed that this was the "deep cleaning" price, but the original price of $190 which was quoted me on the phone was not even offered as an option.  The owner did, however, refund the extra money when I complained.  I might use this service in the future, but will be sure to get a quote in writing first.  The owner also tried several times on the phone to get us to be frequent customers for a lower price.  This felt like a hard sell.<//review>

<Review>My carpets aren’t done, yet. Pretty sure they will be fine. The company offers a groupon which is probably awesome if you are getting your carpets cleaned every 3 months, because it’s literally a basic steam cleaning and in the small print does not include stairs, though advertised as a 2 story house deal. Ended up paying what I would have if I’d booked them directly...not a single penny saved and confusion of 3 different price points for the same exact service....why not just be up front and sell your product instead of deceiving your various customers? Ah well.< /Review><userid>106610119676352382810< /userid><Date>1553895902080<//Date><Name>M Valenzuela</Name>< response>

We tried to hire them and they were rude and the phone call ended with them saying: "Be careful we know where you live." Said by the owner, Robert Spike himself! We later called the police and they had to tell them to leave us alone and put a verbal restraining order on them! Some customer service and satisfaction! Keep your family and friends safe and don't call them or interact with them. They even responded to our other reviews and asked us to remove them. They deny that it wasn't their company but that is somewhat impossible given that theirs was the only company we contacted for this service at the time.<//review>

Contacted Eco clean via their web appointment scheduler. set appointment for the next day at 11 am, toby called at 9:30 indicating he was early could I meet him on 15-20 min, I said yes.  Carpet is very dirty so i agreed to the deep clean, it got nearly all spots out, but some have never come out before.

Had an area rug cleaned also, 35$ additional, well worth my time and money..</Text>

My home smells so amazing and their technician was very professional and sweet! They place YOUR needs first and value your business relationship. I would highly recommend these guys to anyone and I would use them again in a heart beat!</text>

<Text>The techs showed up on time and were nice. My house is about 2900 square feet and about 2000 square feet is carpet. The techs finished cleaning the carpets in 30 minutes. It takes me an hour to vacuum the house. It appeared they were on a race to see how fast they could be done. My carpets were dry in a couple hours on a cold rainy day. I have had a much smaller house carpets cleaned and it takes the guy over an hour and he goes over each area several times. I did not see them go over any area more than one quick pass. Did not seem like a thorough job.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Okay, this company is Definitely going to be around for the long haul as they are competitively priced, making them an great option for carpet cleaning services.l, which I like and their staff is friendly.
I must admit I was skeptical to use them at first considering that I saw their special on Groupon.But I promise you will not be disappointed as long as you call them and ask them exactly what it is that you are going to get.
Also expect an upsell from the technician once he visits your home, telling you that you need some extra stuff in addition to what you purchased,  so be prepared for that  but if you stick to your guns you will be fine and let them know you just want the service that  you ordered.

The carpets were steam cleaned, They looked pretty nice when they were dried as It was hard to tell the difference while they were still wet. I left my AC on and gave it a few hours to dry and I'm happy with the results.

I ended up getting the deodorizer which I won't recommend paying for because they claim to scent last for a month  but once the floor dried it disappeared. If you're going to pay for that just make sure you may regret it l depending on what it costs.

I will definitely use these guys again as their customer service was pretty solid and their response time is pretty great also.

My advice,  keep up the great work and throw in  the  deodorizer  for free It's definitely not an upsell< /text>

<name>Ace Duffy-Pagan<//name><Text>I had my apartment done which a lot of companies can't do which is annoying. But Eco Clean was able to do that service for me at a fair price. I had previous tenants that lived here and had a dog/ cat that made the carpet smell bad under my stairs and I went about it with my manager and he said the Carpets were cleaned before we moved in. I couldn't take the smell so I bought carpet deodorizer, spray, plug it ins and candles. Until finally Eco Clean came into my life did the animal treatment and I don't smell that horrible smell. It's so light that I can't smell it. I will reuse Eco Clean and do one more treatment just to have it 100% gone.  But again I am super impressed and happy to have found this company. So I now found my carpet company for life. Thanks Rob again brother and I hope to talk to you soon.

Sincerely,

This was by far the best experience... to make a long story short. Eco clean made my day. We  initially had another appointment with another company that turned out to be a  disaster.. after having to turn the first company away and our house being rearranged all morning eco clean were able to fit us in last min and we could not be happier. Not to mention we saved a ton, and our carpets are looking great! Thank you for making a day great.< /review>

We were so happy with the carpet and tile cleaning. Our technician Matt called a half hour before arriving and then showed up right on time. He worked really hard and even managed to get a really difficult stain out of our carpet!  Their rates were very reasonable and the online scheduling was easy. Will hire again!<//review>

Horrible customer service where the receptionist and the owner were extremely unprofessional. The owner tried to rip me off. I would not use this company ever again. I would rather go to someone else who's professional and does an awesome job.</text>

After posting my honest review the company emailed me requesting I withdrawal my review ! They immediately tried to bash the customer by claiming that I haven’t cleaned my carpets in 15 years! Which is a blatant lie!!! First off I haven’t even lived here 15 years second I own a steam cleaner and they are cleaned every 60 days due to the fact they are WHITE and I have a POOL! Then they state in their request that I refused the upgraded package ...yes I did not wish to pay an additional 65 dollars when I just wanted a regular cleaning and once they arrived they informed me my Groupon only covered a “light” cleaning I mean that should tell any future customers right there of the type of business they are doing when the first response it to make up a lie and blame the customer for the half assed job their tech did !< /Text>

The gentleman worked diligently and hard, however there was a section I had to ask him to scrub a little harder on my tile shower floor because the grime and scum was clearly not gone.  It took another five minutes, a different cleaning solution, and some extra elbow grease and they came clean. I was a little disappointed that instead of the professional noticing it himself and taking initiative, I had to say something and ask him to do it thoroughly to get the job done right. It seemed that my inspections were met with excuses when I pointed something out I wanted done with excellence.  Overall, he did a good job, and was a likable man ,but if you hire eco-clean, be sure to be an advocate for what you really want.</review>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'll start with I missed the fine print that said no apartments. That's my bad. The tech could have just said sorry amd refunded me and that probably would have been easier. I live on the second story of an open apartment complex and my down stairs neighbors had a hookup. It wasn't all that hard to find where to hook his garden hose up. Yes. Garden Hose! Anyways. The tech kept giving me and my mom this look like you jerks I can't believe you're making me do this. he then proceeded to tell me oh its an additional 40 (I think for a deep clean?) And tried saying its typically 25 per room for an apartment (I have a 3 bedroom and was also having the living room and hallway done.) I argued with him amd asked why I was never told of the charges before. he tried playing it off well cause its an apartment and were not going to know til we get here. I put my UNIT number on the order form amd I explained to him I called the office and talked to his receptionist this morning and asked when he'd be at the apartment. He was like oh thats my boss and started talking about how his boss let's him and the other techs deliver the bad news and that its been a repeatedly addressed problem. I paid him the extra 40, (he waved the 25 a room since his boss didn't I form me of it) I had to leave him there at 11 and my boyfriend was there when he got off work before noon. He said the carpets looked wet but he couldn't tell a difference. I went the next day and nothing looked different. I called to complain and the owner answered. he talked down to me the entire time, introduced me several times in the beginning of the conversation and tried guilt tripping me. Oh well I really dont know what you want us to do miss allen you live I am apartment we don't usually do those were did you a favor and now you're mad at us thats a horrible feeling... No you ripping me off for $100 bucks is a horrible feeling. I caught him lying multiple times. he even tried lying about what was on the invoice which I had a copy of. What a joke! He also tried getting me to stay on the line because he didn't believe his tech would talk about him like that and his tech was just getting there! I do not recommend this company. They aren't there to provide a service. They're there for your money.</review>

The technicians as well as the lady who helped me with rescheduling (and a discount to compensate for a minor inconvenience ) were all very nice and professional. We even shared some good laughs. The work on my carpets was great and I would recommend and use them in the future< /review>

I have cleaned my carpets myself for years.  This cleaning was excellent and better by far.  Kevin was a doll. He  did an outstanding job.  Now I am spoiled and I will be calling EcoClean from now on.  Kevin also did an amazing job on my sofas. Thanks so much again. I could not be happier!!</Review>

I've gotten my carpets cleaned by this company before and was very satisfied. This time around, not so much. The guy finished my house in about 30 minutes and once dried, they looked they were never cleaned. Kinda upsetting considering I'm preparing for a new baby. Seemed like because I didnt want to get anything extra done to the carpets that they offered, he did a poor job.</Review>

Good service and easy to work with but our carpets look dull. We have stain master carpets and it’s very dark almost black and now it look gray with a brownish tint. I’m disappointed because I asked if they knew how to clean this type of carpet. I won’t use them again.

Since my review the owner called me an explained the issue with my carpet and has vowed to correct the dullness. He was very informative and I learned from him how to better care for the carpet. I’m giving 5 stars for the awesome customer service, knowledge and service they provide.  I will use them again knowing what I know now. Thank you EcoClean for standing by your word and service.</review>

<text>We took advantage of their tile & grout cleaning special. The grout in our kitchen is white and looks somewhat dirty. Unfortunately, after the tech finished, the grout looked just as dirty. The tile looked great, but that wasn't the issue. I cannot recommend them for grout cleaning.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>They had to reschedule our carpet cleaning and stretching twice.  Once it was done the carpet looks the same and the stretching looks worse then before.  Now there are areas where the carpet meets the tile that don't stay tucked in.  They did not have any furniture guards so I had to buy them from home depot.  I definitely would not use this company again.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<user_name>Project Outdoor Life - POL<//user_name><Review>HORRIBLE!  Avoid this company like the plague.   The owner is unethical and doesn't know how to ckean carpet or tile. I bought 2 separate items on Groupon - the carpet cleaning and the tile cleaning and both were a total joke. The carpet - they just moved the dirt around and made it all gray. The tile - was partially cleaned.  I had to argue with them to come fix it and they finally agreed but then cancelled the appointment. If you care about your home then don't let them near your property. By the way - their poor technician was forced by the owner to try and upsell me.  I overheard the owner coaching him in the phone  he said I have money and can afford it because I work downtown.</Review>< rate>

<text>Bought on groupon a single strory three bedroom up to 1200 sq ft house. Original cost 129 I paid 55.00 for groupon. Bought this on a recommendation from friend. When making my appt it asked what treatments were needed, I notated them: example pet stains, pet urine etc.  Technician arrived ( he was really nice so my review should not reflect him) and proceeded to tell me that the groupon only covered their quick clean valued at 129.00 (that wouldn’t handle what we needed) but to handle my pet issues it would cost my an additional $69.00 for that package ( the pet packages is 149.00 regularly)  Since we had moved our enrire bedroom furniture out to clean I had to agree for the extra pre treatment to accomplish what we wanted. Thank goodness we vacuumed prior since I didn’t see the technician vacuum. After all was done including a tip which is expected, I ended up paying full price for something I thought was a good deal. I won’t recommend or return for the price I paid lbecause it’s misleading. The tech was nice though.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1541868862725, 'text': "I'm sorry Michelle, I think after our talk we made it right and thank you for that chance!

I was  happy  to   use  a groupon rate  and Jeff  did a  fine job on my carpet.
the pet  stains are not viable   at the  moment    ...so I sure  hope   they dont reappear!!!     He also stretched the carpet.
we  are  happy  with  this  service     and would recommend ECO CLEAN

<text>Posting for my sister: purchased the Groupon carpet cleaning for $125 for 2 story, up to 2500sf of carpet. When I called, she said stairs were extra, then $270 includes 2 area rugs, sectional and staircase. I proceeded. The cleaner the  came out and told me it would be $360 for the job,  ON TOP OF THE $125 I paid Groupon. When i asked why . price was increasing, he flat out said it was "bait and switch" ....?! He said all that groupon was good for was water put on the carpet, mo cleaning solution. What?? Why would that ever be an option? After telling him this was a scam, he ended up doing the work for a total of $270, including the groupon amount paid. I spoke to the company, and was told he shouldn't have done that. So why did he do it? I'm filing a complaint with the BBB, and groypon. Buyer beware!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The man that came out was on time and very nice. He explained everything thoroughly. Although he mentioned some spots would possibly wick up, this was way worse than expected. After spending $109 on the Groupon then an additional $149 for the deep clean the results a week later were dissapointing. He also emptied the used water on our lawn, saying that is would actually be good for the grass but it burned a big spot on the grass. I could have probably done just as well with my Bissel cleaner.< /text>

<text>I purchased the groupon for 1 story house. The technician came and explain to me that because of some of the heavy used areas, I need to get the deep cleaning which I did for additional $69 then also asked me to buy stain remover for extra $10. I also purchased that. After the service is completed, I inspected the carpet and the carpet still looks dirty and most of the heavy used areas looks the same. I don't even know if the technician actually used a carpet steam. I asked him to re do the other room but still looks dirty. The technician told me that he cannot do anything about it and I need to replace the carpet. I don't have any pets nor bringing dirty shoes inside the rooms so it is just a regular soiling form usual daily use. I am very disappointed of the service.
However, the owner called me and offered to redo the service. He sent Yule who cleaned the carpet of my townhouse (he is the reason why I went back of using this company because he really did a superb job at my townhouse). Yule came and he re did the three rooms and what a big difference!! He even showed me the area he finished cleaning and you could see that the previous technician didn't do his job. My carpet looks cleaner and newer now. I really appreciate the prompt response of the owner and for sending Yule to redo the cleaning of the carpet. If you use the service of EcoClean, ask for Yule Mathews. He is very thorough and very professional.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Was not clean.  I clean my carpet pretty often but this time, I decided to try this company because I saw them on Groupon. and this is the first time it wasn't clean afterwards.   The guy who cleaned it told me that when it dried, the areas that were dirty would look lighter and clean.  I believed him.  I waited till today, a day later for it to be dry, but it didn't get any better. When I called to complain,  they were rather rude.  The person I spoke to was called Rob. Plus later on, when I used my private bathroom, I fell in - one of the two guys obviously used my toilet and didn't put the toilet seat back down. Will not recommend or use this company again< /text>

This is very standard practice for a carpet cleaning company to do when the scope of the job becomes much larger and different than the coupon is being offered for.

The carpets looked fine and my 2 star review has nothing to do with the quality of the job. I was unhappy with Eco Clean Carpet due to the pricing and the information I was given before setting up the appointment. I bought the groupon at a fantastic discount of $109 however before purchasing the groupon I called the company to explain my carpet cleaning needs and make sure the goupon was the best way to go. The customer service person said she thought so but wanted to check with her supervisor, so after a brief hold she came back to say yes, the groupon  was a great deal for my house. Once the technician arrived and evaluated my carpets, I was extremely surprised to find out I would have to pay an additional $149 for him to clean my carpets. I wish I would have canceled the cleaning service right then and there but I felt since I already purchased the groupon I had no choice. I called the office the next day to explain the situation and let them know I did not feel like I was given proper information prior to the technician arriving at my house and the price seemed very high since it was advertised on groupon as a 70% discount. The supervisor let me know there was nothing he could do at this point however next time I use them they will give me a deeply discounted repeat customer price. Needless to say, I will not be using this company again.<//Text>

I called to ask about the groupon before I purchased it to clarify exactly what I needed. Since I have a two-story house I had to buy the two-story groupon even though the carpet is only on one story. It obviously costs more yet it doesn't include cleaning the carpet on the stairs. Stairs are extra. I was told by Eco Clean that groupon doesn't allow them to include the price of the stairs in the offer. I thought it was odd but was told it's only $3 per stair and they don't charge more for risers like other companies. I was also offered other services at a lower rate (tile and upholstery cleaning) since I was purchasing the groupon, and was told the price offered would be entered in my profile for the cleaner to see and honor.

Once the cleaner arrived I mentioned I purchased a groupon and was adding tile cleaning and upholstery cleaning. He wouldn't offer the same price on the tile cleaning because I wanted my kitchen counter tile cleaned and they only do floor tile. He said he would still do it if I wanted but not for that low of a price. I feel the lady who offered me this extra service should have clarified, or the cleaner should have honored the price. Then he proceeded to up sell me on carpet and upholstery cleaning.

I despise up selling! I would much rather use a company that is totally upfront about pricing even if I'm paying a little more for it. I bought a groupon for what seemed to be a decent price but found out from experience that the company's goal is to up sell once they are in your home; so much so that I even asked what I purchased the groupon for. Found out it was just for a basic shampooing. I suspect that the groupon price is no savings at all, probably close to the same price every other company offers so it looks good on paper but then once they're in your house you feel the need to purchase one of the other packages in addition or you're just wasting your money otherwise.

The cleaner was friendly. He called to let me know when he would be to my house and called again when he realized he would be a little late. He seemed experienced and knowledgeable. I paid after with a credit card and a tip option pops up at signing which is awkward especially after all the up selling at the beginning. Then the cleaner handed me his phone and said I just needed to fill out one more thing. Turns out it was a review. He didn't ask but just said it would take me two minutes to complete at the most. Since he was standing right there I almost filled out a good review for him because it was awkward not to otherwise. I didn't feel right about that because I read reviews beforehand and really rely on other people's experiences and I wasn't completely satisfied after my own. I asked if I could fill out the survey later once I have a chance to at least see how his work turns out. He tried to pressure me to fill it out right then so I simply declined. If the company insists on such a quick review I wonder how many of those reviews can really be trusted?

The job was done and seems to be fairly satisfactory. I think the carpets turned out well. I'm just a little disappointed because I don't like the way Eco Clean operates as a business. I will likely try someone else next time and see how the experience compares. In the meantime, I won't be recommending Eco Clean to my friends and family.< /Review>

On Tuesday the Eco service person came to shampoo my carpet.  My carpet looked the same as it did before he came, plus the carpet was soaking wet and stayed wet for almost a week afterwards.  I am very displeased and will not use this service again.<//Review>

<review>Well, they try a bit too hard to up-sell their services. Then, when you don't upgrade, the resulting service is very basic and rushed. A 1,600 sqft house done in 25 minutes? Not worth it. Next time I will try someone else.< /review>< pics>

Rob, the owner, is profoundly rude.  They did a dreadful job. Did not get out a single spot.  Looked dirtier than before they came.  Left everything so wet and soggy that it started to mold.  I had to have it re-cleaned and dried.  Awful company.  Do not use.<//review>

The place was easy to locate however; why does it have 2 names?
The food was great, even my picky eaters loved it.
Our server was awesome.
Very patient.
My only concern was he wasn't wearing a mask even though we sat outside.</review>

<Text>We stopped here for lunch after a visit to Charles Paddock Zoo. I am so glad we did! The food was really great. We had tacos, burrito and enchiladas amongst us and we loved it, kids included. The place (and bathrooms) are very clean. The serving staff didn't wear masks but we kept ours on while they were near our table.<//Text>< Time>

This is my favorite restaurant to stop by when we are in town. Real authentic mexican food and great portions for a good price! Good service and atmosphere. On holidays they have this amazing plate called Birria you have to try it.< /review>

<review>Great food...most of the time.  We've ordered from here several times and thought we had finally found reliable, quality mexican food in A town.    And that was true until we tried their burger and beef tacos.   Best description I can offer is mystery meat.  One of the few times we've requested a refund.   This was not always the case. First time we ordered from here we had delicious ground beef burrito and tacos.  But for the time being, we're just sticking to the veggie (bean and cheese) and chicken Chimichanga and chicken tacos, which are always delicious!!  On a side note, the last few months they stopped including chips and salsa and their salsa is muy bien!< /review>< Response>

This place is no longer Marinas Cocina but I think it's better! We had great food there. We will definitely go back. Quite possibly my new favorite Mexican food restaurant in Atascadero.<//Review>

Came here first day in town, it was an off hour so not too many people in which we always preferred. The service was great and the food was super yummy. Excellent portion sizes on the lunch menu and the margaritas we're served ice cold and in liter size, so worth it! Wish there was Mexican food this yummy back home. Recommend the shrimp enchilada.</Review>

<Text>Marinas Cocina is our go to lunch spot. Quick easy, good service, nice chili verde, chips that are of the thin variety which I really like. Nice chunky salsa. And I think I'll go there for lunch again today. Thank you marinas Cocina.< /Text>< pics>

Was not happy at all, sat down and therw wwre ants on the table.
I was told that this table always gets them, then I order horchata and cocktail. Horchata was out of the bag per the gentlemen behind the bar and the shrimp in the cocktail was not fresh at all.
Was over priced for the portions.< /text>

If you do not mind being greeted and seated by the owner who happens to be talking to someone else on his cell phone as a first impression it is a great place.  His "help" was at the bar on her computer. The food was mediocre but mediocre in its mediocrity.  Many individuals have lost sight of what customer service is about in this electronic day and age, if I am giving someone my money to receive service I do not expect the attention to be given to someone else on a cell phone. Too bad, I wanted it to be good. I left an adequate tip anyway out of respect for those who serve. Will not go back or recommend it.<//review>

It's not the most authentic Mexican joint in town, but they very well might have the best salsa.

If you're not gonna hang out for cheap beers, I suggest taking your burrito to go and eating it at the lake Park across the street!</text>

<Time>1466209530324< /Time><text>Had the Atascadero Giant burrito. It was fantastic. Beef was flavorful and cooked perfectly, sauces were on point, and the portion was, well gigantic.
Tacos have a good portion of meat, with basically a salad on top, great deal for 3 bucks.

Great food at a reasonable price, good atmosphere and convenient location. Has a small dining room and small sports bar and on the way to Morro Bay. Make it a point to stop here if you're coming from out of town.
If you live in or near Atown and haven't eaten here, it's time to rectify that mistake.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Got to give this place a good rating just for being open 24 hours. Food was decent too. Lighting was pretty dark late in the night though. Still, I'd come here again to get some good late night Mexican food.<//text>

<text>Really good food I love there Tortas but when I called to place an order they spoke Spanish and I said "I don't speak Spanish do you speak English?" in Spanish *the only sentence I remember from Spanish class* and they hung up on me!

I have eaten here before and it was good no problems. Tonight i went into in there and there is no letter grade on the door, no service, and lots of things were not refrigerated. Based upon that I can no longer eat there.< /text>

I love this place for A group of people. They serve the Biggest Burritos, Pizza, And Asada Quesadillas. They taste very Good, when your craving something Greasy and Just plain Unhealthy. But overall place is not great atmosphere, They never have someone available in the front to give u anything you need. You have to get their attention which is hard because they are busy making your food. But definitely worth a try!<//Text>

<text>As I'm sitting here, looking at the food how good it looks but once I got my meal, it wasn't so good as it look. My opinion, this place need a new make over & the food needs more effort. Other then that your money is worth spending at this place!</text><username>PrettyBoy Junior</username>< Response>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>Awful service!! Hot, sticky, and sometimes gross inside... AMAZING FOOD. Honestly, I've had to wait 30+ minutes in crazy, crazy heat for a torta and a burrito. Granted, each where absolutely massive, enough for two big meals. After all that wait when I asked the guy for "dos salsas por favor," hey nodded, and came back with no salsas and disappeared back into the cooking area where he could pretend we didn't exist even though we were attempting to make eye contact. One time a friend of mine that happens to be a very attractive young Latina had to endure looks from creepy older men during one of those excessively long waits while she was picking something up for me.  She was very uncomfortable. I'll never ask another girl to go there for me. But the food is AMAZING.<//Text>< Pics>

If i could rated with no stars, I would. I ordered the biggest pizza here by recommendation and to be honest it was one of the worst pizza i have ever had. If i could go back in time id rather go to a different place. A microwave pizza taste better then what i had. Im not sorry for this review and i will definitely avoid this establishment in the near future.<//text>

I've been there a couple of times and I went there again tonight- and they were awesome. The only drawback they have is that their menu is mostly in Spanish but if you know some Spanish- you won't have much of a problem. The food and service are worth it. I highly recommend the Super Burrito with Carne Asada. To El Fogon- thank you for another awesome dinner!</review>

< Review>
Was looking for something different for my Mom's visit.  My son suggested 3rd and U.  Sure why not?  It was excellent!  Wasn't feeling a beer so we had ciders!  So good!  Great burgers!  I tried the mushroom swiss and had them add grilled onions.   It was so good, burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was soft and did not overwhelm the meat!  But strange to say, the chipotle mayo was the star of the show.  I got it on a whim and everyone at the table ended up asking for their own. Can't wait to go back, it may be our new go to burger joint.< /Review>

Best breakfast burritos in the world, just $5.50 for a huge burrito eggs, cheese, French fries, and your choice of meat bacon, ham, sausage, hot links or vegetarian. Served from 10am to 1130am weekdays and till 1230am on weekends. They also give you a bottle of what I believe is great home made salsa! Routine is 1 squirt then bite then squirt then bite, repeat as necessary.< /review>

<review>This cute mom & pop restaurant is one of our favorite places to eat in Davis. You can't go wrong with a burger, buffalo chicken sandwich, steak sandwich,  salad, chicken tenders, or the hot dogs. Ask if they have potato salad,  you wont regret it! They also have 2 for $8 beers every day! Cant beat good food and good beer at a reasonable price. The owners are super nice as well.< /review><user_name>The Figueroa Family</user_name><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

Really delicious food. They run out of random veggies though. Prices are pretty much what you'd expect for downtown Davis.</Review>

<review>They have improved after the recent work on 3rd street. Food was very bad in the past but last time I actually liked it. Beer is cheap and they have several tap options which vary from time to time. But what I love the most is the outdoor sitting. A pity they do not closed later than 9 pm. Good place overall</review>< resp>

<text>Second time coming here. First time was great! We got our food in a timely manner and everything was delicious. However, today was the worst restaurant service I've ever been treated to. We went for brunch around 10:45am and ordered our food. After about 45 minutes of waiting, I went to the cashier and asked how much longer the wait would be for our food, she was very rude and told me she "just runs the cashier" and I shouldn't bother her with that. I asked one of the runners who told us that it would be about 10 more minutes for our food. We waited another 15 minutes, a total of 1 hour, for our food, still no sign. I went up to the cashier for my money back and they were not ready to give me my full amount. So overall, I waited an hour and fifteen minutes for my food and then was not refunded my full amount. I will not be coming back here again. Although the food is good when you actually get it, it is not worth the awful customer service.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

I like the casual atmosphere of students studying. The food is salad and sandwiches. The television can be set to whichever channel that you want.</Review>

I would describe the atmosphere more as a sports bar than a cafe, but you'll find more than just fried bar food. They have quite decent burgers and panini. The place can get pretty crowded with students, especially if there's a major sporting event on. There's a nice patio, but it can get smoky at times. Overall a decent place to meet with a group for food and drink.< /review>

Just enough beers on tap, though they are still very into IPA. The spicy buffalo chicken sandwich here is awesome, and the chili fries rank among the best in Davis. Definitely work checking out in between classes or when your work day goes way too long and you need a place to decompress.<//Text>

Chill, sports bar feel with great all-around American diner fare, including small bites, burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Although on opposite sides of the spectrum, the california burger and teriyaki burger are both big hits for me. Pair that with the fantastic (IPA) tap list and special, this place screams happy hour.<//Review>

<Text>Terrible service. I spent at least 10 minutes wait in line to order while to cashier was no where in site. I finally ordered and had to wait at least 20 more minutes for my sandwich to go.

The entire time I was there drunk college students were yelling at each other for no good reason.

The food was good,  but nothing special. It's not hard to screw up a turkey club...

I don't think I'll ever go back.<//Text>< Pics>

Noisy. Not a great menu. Not really a sports bar even though that is how they market themselves. Very few tvs. Customer service is ok.< /Review>

Best place to come to if you need a Tile loan! The Staff is great, they have excellent customer service. They really care about your needs and situation. It was real easy and very hands one, if you come with the proper documentation. Would I recommend anyone of my friends to come there to get a loan YES Indeed! Thank You Charlie and Carolina for your great service.</Text>< Date>

Today I went in to get further information for a loan. I was greeted the second I got in, I was helped right away and they even offered me coffee. As Leslie was giving me details Laura and Carolina also had side conversations while I waited. These ladies were amazing, I typically don’t review or rate anything, but these ladies deserve the recognition! They did amazing and I could not be happier with their service. Thank you Titlemax for having great ladies like these in your company!!<//review>

TitleMax isn't where you go for a low-interest long term loan.  It's where you go when you need money fast and know you can pay it off quick.  This place is what it is and there's obviously a need for this kind of service.  At the Lancaster location Charlie was most helpful and professional.  He walked me through the process and it worked out well for me and presumably for him too.  That's a win/win.</Text>

This location offers top notch service with a personal touch that can't be beat. We worked with Carolina who was by far the best and most effective loan person we have ever worked with.
Over all We give this location 5 stars as that's all that's offered the entire staff here are out standing!< /text>

In a pinch this was a great choice for me. Of course I did some research before deciding on Title Max.  Yoselin helped thru the whole process and advised me that I would need to be there  at least an hour. So I'm glad she gave me this info before arriving and set a time for me to meet with her. She was very professional and courteous. She was able to answer my questions which I felt at ease to proceed with the loan. They even gave me the chance if i wanted to put the headrest back on to my driver side. I'm short so I don't care to have it. It just might have given me less of an amount to loan. I appreciate the detail of her process. I'm very happy with the service that was provided and the app to make paying a whole lot easier. Thanks for the cough drops Yoselin and the wonderful service!!</Review>

If there is a option for zero stars......i would select it.  I'm not sure who is writing these highly positive reviews, but I received lying and shady service from the early beginning.  The regular guy that works there (Charlie)
advised me to switch my registration to CA which was fine after 4 hrs in the DMV :(    also after waiting a week a half to receive my CA title in the mail, I bring everything they asked for and still got turned down!   TERRIBLE SERVICE.....and i went down the street and got approved from Fast Auto Loans easily!!!!!    I highly recommend FAL and please save a headache from Titlemax with their very poor service!!!!!!</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I loved the service that the girls in this business offered me. Thank you very much for your help. If I need a loan, I do not hesitate to return with them. I recommend it.

The new taco stand here is amazing. I heard it was every other Friday and every Saturday. $2.50 each and if you buy six , the 'agua fresca' is included. The orange salsa is quite spicy so watch out!<//Text>

I needed just one item. However, I went home with 6. This little market appears to not only meet the needs of the community, but the needs of weekenders and anybody else just up here for the day. The staff was friendly as well as very helpful. I will definitely make this little market my GoTo place for quick shopping needs.< /Review>

Prices are high, no returns accepted. Charging 300% industry standard for chains and other items. Save your money and go elsewhere.<//review>

< Review>
A few months ago I was travelling to big bear with my family and went in to buy chains. They sold me the chains and wouldn't help me get them on. They ended up not fitting our SUV which the store clerk said they were. They wouldn't refund my purchase so I filed a fraud report with my credit card and was refunded. The prices were crazy too. Do not buy from here! Fraudulent illegal business.< /Review>

Fraudulent business. I was on my way up to big bear when I was stopped and told I needed chains. I asked around where I could get some and was told to try Mountain High market. There was only one employee working whom I found out later was new. I’ve never had any experience with chains until this day, so I asked the employee if it was better to have 4 chains or two for my front wheel drive sedan. She said 4 would be better so I asked to buy 4. I placed my phone displaying a photo of my tire and tire size on the booklet and the employee helped me find my chain size, or so I thought. She went to the back room and came back with a bag of chains. She explained the no refund policy and I bought the chains with my debit card. When I opened the bag, I found two chains instead of the four I had requested. Additionally, they weren’t the right size. They were unusable, not even close to fitting. I asked the lady to return them and she refused, stating there were no refunds. I told her, “I understand the policy but you sold me the incorrect item. I asked for four chains and you sold me two that don’t fit my car. If you don’t accept the return this is fraud.” She called her manager, Kelly, who instructed her not to complete the refund. I decided to try to go up the mountain anyhow and had a great day of skiing (apparently the chains didn’t need to be on my car, I had to have them with me just in case). On my way back down I decided to stop by Mountain High in hopes a manager or different employee with better morals might be there. A different employee was there, and I told her I was sold the wrong item and it would be fraudulent if they didn’t honor the return. She called Kelly again, and Kelly told her to not honor the refund. I asked to speak to Kelly and was refused, so I told them I was calling the police. The police showed up and I made a police report. I left my chains on the counter and left. I filed a fraud report with my credit card company who finished the investigation and reimbursed me today with the 140$ I spent on a single pair of chains. Chains cost 50$ at Walmart. This shop is committing highway robbery on the regular and is fraudulent in its business practices. DO NOT BUY FROM MOUNTAIN HIGH MARKET. Do not support a business that scams its customers. Kelly is scum of the earth ordering her employees to commit fraud on her behalf. Do not support this illegal establishment. whatsoever.</review>

Thank God they're here because when the roads get super iced over, it's extremely difficult to get to a grocery store.  They have enough food and supplies to get the job done.< /review>

Nice staff. Helpful staff. Kind of a strange environment. You’ll feel weird sitting here with your laptop. Go to the one across the street. They don’t serve hot foods here. So don’t think you’ll be having breakfast. Orange is a nice area and this is a pretty historical building. But besides that, not the best option for a Starbucks. Small. Cramped.</text>

Not recommended!
If you will calm down and have a coffee in a silent environment and read a book or your emails, don't come to this Starbucks!! The very loud music at this place will expose you for noise pollution and headache!<//text>

<Review>My favorite Starbucks. Since there are two Starbucks at the Orange Plaza this one actually has  seating. My husband and I love to come here  on Sunday and read the paper in relative peace  The one by the cigar store is usually full of students on their laptops. I think the lack of parking is actually a plus in this situation.<//Review>< pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Review>This place has always been super fast and efficient. My drinks have been consistent and the staff is very friendly! Nothing bad so far in my many visits. They have a large selection of mugs and cups to the far right as well! Their teas and coffee beans are right in the open as well.

Since it is more of a kiosk inside the Wells Fargo Bank, there are plenty of tables and one large table for groups. A good place to sit and chat or get some studying or work done. The building has lovely tall ceilings made of what looks like the original wood. It's actually very pretty. Make sure to look up when you're there!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dcd9e717e95e37:0xf414512461244ce9<//gmap_id></record>

This Starbucks is located inside the Wells Fargo building which happens to be the oldest building in the city. The building is gorgeous and all you need to do is look up and you will instantly find peace. There are plenty of tables and couches to lounge on while you sip on your caffeine. For all you budding novelists and screenplay writers, this is the ideal coffee shop to plug in and type away. Starbucks inconveniently shares their restroom with Wells Fargo so you need to enter the bank area if you need to go.<//review>

Ordered the special pumpkin spice coffee since the picture looked so great. I asked for extra whipped cream, and was disappointed when my whip  cream was below the top of the cup. I looked at it and asked for more please, and the barista added a small rosette. I sat down with  my drink and looked at the board again and felt shorted the advert-
ised 4" of whipped cream so I once again went up and told him I wanted my drink to look like the one in the add above his head! Wish I had taken photos,  also, they don't offer decaf!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

The only two times going there, the orders were wrong.  Working at Starbucks is not exactly rocket science.  When I order an upside down Caramel Frappuccino, that's what I expect to get.  Driving the extra few miles from now on.  That locations employees know what they're doing.<//Review>

<text>The Old Town  Orange Starbucks at the Circle. Staff are super friendly. Weekends are crowded. Parking is difficult. Its one of those places you might need to stroll to if you can't find parking close by. There are plenty of streets and shops to stroll through.< /text><rate>4< /rate><pictures>None< /pictures><Date>1454353014238<//Date></record>

I visited this cofee house last Saturday night. The seating is plentiful. The lighting is just right for the evening. The noise level is ok. I had the Turkish Cafe Latte with Cardamom. I did not add any sweetener to it nor anything else. It tasted great the way it was made. This place is better than Starbucks. I was...</review>

Update: make that ZERO stars!
I'm a regular (ok...ex-) who thought I'd hike five miles to my favorite Sunday Starbucks. Last Sunday SUPRIZE!
Small sign on door indicating they are
NOW CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.
No prior notice nor warning.
I had scheduled a meeting there.
Rush to stop everything.
Went across street to the other Circle Starbucks...line out the door!
Even bathroom had long wait!
SO:
Clearly Starbucks just does not care or need me, the customer.
SO I DO NOT NEED THEM!
I'm tired of all their little stupid games and screwups. No order, no prep any more and I WAS holding up to 20 meetings a week at various Starbucks. FINI!
I'll take my small personal account elsewhere...they won't care.
But they might notice my BUSINESS
account of $2,000- $3,000/mo missing.
Goodbye Starbucks...
It was nice knowing you...

Prior good review....

It's a Starbucks....BUT...
fantastic historical setting
actually INSIDE the Wells Fargo Bank, oldest in area, is spectacular!<//text>

< Review>
I mean, come on. It’s Fentons! Enough said, amirite? 😂

Okay okay, seriously though. My entire family is Bay Area born and raised. My dad still talks about stories of taking my mom to Fentons in the earlyyyyy dates WAY back when haha. It cracks me up every time. But it brings me SUCH feels to now do the same with my partner.

I’m gonna cut to the chase. Black and Tan. It’s a must-have. My amateur-self didn’t realize you could order it on a boat. Don’t be an amateur like me! Honestly, come for fun, nostalgic fun we’ve all been missing lately.</Review>

<Review>What's not to like about rich, creamy and flavorful ice cream, decadent sundaes and great variety of hot and cold sandwiches and salads, all in a setting of a retro Ice Cream  Parlour that has served generations of guests. A great selection of ice cream, sorbets and toppings. An awesome place for celebratory groups and families. The crab sandwich on toasted French bread and the Roast Beef with Au jus are two long time favorites of mine that come with tasty fries with great texture or side salad. Old fashioned milk shakes made in the stainless large cup, served frosty in a old fashioned tall milkshake glass with a tall spoon and the remainder in the metal cup.  What a delightful place.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>A MUST whenever in the Oakland/Piedmont area. This has become a family tradition that we live by—grabbing a banana sundae whenever there’s a special occasion, and we never regret it. Fenton’s has the best ice cream in the Bay Area hands down!</Review><Time>1620703468632< /Time><response>None<//response><Name>Abigail Chin< /Name>< Gmap_id>

The experience here was underwhelming. I was expecting a great place based on the reviews but honestly I can get something that tastes 10 times better from the grocery store for a fraction of the price. For such a “historical” establishment I was expecting fresh, flavorful, homemade ice cream. I got cheap, artificial tasting ice cream that didn’t even taste like the flavor I got (blueberry cheesecake). I also paid $6 for a very small scoop. Definitely not worth the price!</Text>

I love the wide variety of ice cream, food, sundaes and more that they offer. We just had lunch in the area so we wanted to try some dessert. I got a single scoop of blueberry cheesecake ice cream. Oh man this was delicious! I am a huge fan of anything blueberry flavored and I love cheesecake so this was the perfect combination for me personally.<//Review>

<Text>Fenton's Black & Tan is old school delicious. They have many great sundaes, but usually that is what I treat myself to.

Great service ...very polite and professional.</Text>< Pics>

The almond ice cream varies from day to day, but sometimes it's like it's just frozen crunchy almond butter and it's delightful. The black and tan sundae is hard to beat.< /text>

<Text>I absolutely loved visiting this quintessential ice cream store that’s a staple in the sf Bay Area. However, I now prefer the tastier ice cream stores. They did a great job of making sure visitors were safe though, and they were very nice!<//Text>< pictures>

The ice cream is okay but there is nothing unique about it that would justify spending $6 dollars for a small scoop. It might sound harsh, but the truth is for that price you can get a tastier small pint of ice cream at your local grocery store. The place was also packed, with about 10 employees jammed behind the counter, which made the ordering process overwhelming. Oh well, at least we tried it for ourselves.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Alex Khammari</user_name><gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30<//gmap_id>< time>

< Review>
A true gem of Oakland's history and present and so much fun. Fenton's created some well known ice cream flavors and the recipes are sometimes based on California agriculture like Toasted Almond. They continue to create new and seasonal flavors each month too like Bing Cherry with chunks of cherry in the ice cream.<//Review>

<Text>Killer sandwiches, burgers and appetizers. Excellent homemade ice cream and monster sized scoops make Fentons a must try if you are in the area. A definitive Oakland landmark thats been around over 100 years. This ain't Baskin Robbins, its a great place where you can enjoy some amazing creations.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>I have to say, I’m sitting on my couch eating THE BEST DANG BLT SANDWICH I’ve ever eaten, no exaggeration. Like, the bacon is perfectly crispy, the tomatoes are fresh and delicious, the breast is toasted perfectly golden brown, there’s perfect quantities of everything— it’s a simple sandwich but it’s really, really yummy! Fentons knocked it out of the park with this one.</review><user>103218069509122549297</user></record></dataset><record>

Best ice cream I've ever had. I got a Black and tan and I highly recommend it to anyone who goes.

They also have a ton of other sundaes and ice cream options to choose from. There's a whole menu of food and desserts.

I think it was called Cream Caramel Almond Crunch or something along those lines. Anyway, it was delicious, gooey, creamy, and heavenly.

<Review>While on a business trip, a coworker who has family ties to Oakland took me to Fentons and I'm glad he did! I think I may have to make that a routine stop on my trips to the Bay area. Had the Fenton Club with fries...which I would recommend for a meal. However, the Cookie Connection was the main attraction and it did not disappoint!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>This was one of the highlights of our trip. The food was great and the service was amazing. They were extremely busy but everything came out in a good time. The ice cream was also some of the best I've had with lots of options to choose from. Definitely stop by if you are in the area.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8n3ZW6i3miHGcwXlgHJ35NY7UL0ha5DHg0RCH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlU-fZbk0DyANFSw0uOS8oNiyAmqT1Epu1X95m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfEGGtkBYX_49oZygbKs2Hhc4Y38yi41i1nCQL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRn6LZmKl-ZT_V21mh0tXbL0Wj1E_iC1B-UDe2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORlGo2u_K5bw-K7BMItujkUSeFhY4Xgja0lwx3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30< /gmapID></record>

I’m told this is an iconic ice cream store and it lived up to its billing. We had the special of the day - apple pie - and it was excellent!  Lots of apples and cinnamon with bits of crust. Worth the calories. They have outdoor seating too. Very nice.<//Review>< rate>

It was my first time going here today& since i had already eaten dinner, I went straight to their ice cream sundae menu. My gf and I ordered the "Fentons Special." Not sure if it the best sundae out there for everyone,  but for me it was perfect. I am horrible with decisions & with that sundae, since it has a little bit of everything, it was perfection. It is definitely a sundae meant to share with someone or to bring home. I didn't realize how big the sundae was when i ordered it abd was definitely not prepared for the amount of ice cream that was given. The servers were very polite and easy going. It was busy when i went which was about 7PM on a Monday night.<//Text>

Five stars for the ice cream. My friends and I tested the best banana split between here, Mitchell's of SF, and Ghiradelli, and found that Fenton's is the best due to the better ice cream. The other places are great too, but I'll always pick here first< /review>

There always seems to be a long line, so I recommended putting an order online and just picking it up. There website allows you to place it and pay once you pick it up.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>My family have been going to this creamery for the past three generations and every time friends visit we make a point to take them here. Fentons, by far,   has the best ice cream in town, but recently their customer service has fallen off the wagon. On a recent trip I intended to buy two 1/2 gallons and the manager told me with a snarky voice that he was out of 1/2 gallon containers  and had to sell me the ice cream for nearly double the price in smaller containers. I'm sorry, but any reasonable person would give me the same quantity of ice cream for the same price regardless of what containers you ran out of. That's just good customer service and quite honestly I'm disappointed with this type of service from Fentons.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Classic American ice cream place where the medium size portion would be equivalent to 3 Italian ice creams. No fruit flavors other than sherbet. The ice cream is good but the whipped cream is too sweet and has some added flavor. good but not impressive.< /Review>< Resp>

Nostalgic and fun, a great place to stop for ice cream treats with all sorts of toppings.  The place is lively and large enough to accommodate a lot of people.  Service was pretty good and friendly.  Nice they have their own parking lot, though it’s small so you might not land a space.   Sweet potato fries were very good and portion size was generous too.< /text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Very good ice cream on a sunny day. This place was hopping busy for a weekday lunchtime. I ordered my ice cream in the to go line - cream caramel almond crunch. Of course it was good. It's ice cream! I sat out on the side patio to enjoy it. Just be prepared for the price. $5.45 for a petite, and a regular size was over $9. Yabba!< /Review>< Pics>

Fentons is an institution that does not really need further reviews. Being at Fenton's is always a warm and great experience, and the food is great. If you have room left for ice cream, their sundaes are definitely ones to remember.</text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>If you go here make sure your hungry for good ice cream cause that’s what you’ll get .
The servers are very friendly , it’s often crowded but I have gotten in within 15-20 minutes most times I went and I have 5 in my family . Now the food is good the crab salad sandwiches are scrumptious and yummy . The ice cream portions are big , order the petite for a one person portion . I read others reviews of this place band all I can say is if you don’t give this place 5 your delusional in your expectations of what a good , busy ice cream shop is !
Not to mention all the nostalgia that this place exhibits. If you want great ice cream and fun , come to Fenton’s</text>< Pictures>

<review>A historical Bay Area establishment.. they opened in 1894 I believe? They were also featured in the Pixar movie Up. Never eaten the food here, just the ice cream. This time we got ice cream cookie sandwiches. The chocolate chip cookie was great but the macadamia white chocolate cookies were too hard for the sandwich.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>All around very good experience. For adults and three little kids. Everyone enjoyed their food. The fish and chips were good, and the ice cream excellent. Services good and the staff could not be more friendly. There might be a long wait, but I'd say it's worth it. This is 100% traditional, old-fashioned ice cream shop.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The ice cream is the best I’ve had in the US.  It had flavor and not just mostly sweetness. The ambience is full of Norman Rockwell nostalgia.<//Text>< Time>

Still the best eventhough, for now, it's just a fraction of the unbelievably grand size delicious sundaes they serve when dining in.  Once the ban is lifted, we'll get back to sitting in, ordering up, and over indulging ourselves.</review>

This is amazing ice cream, beware though the scoop size is big! It is a treat for tase buds. Highly recommended to go with the main ice cream speciality. This is not only a good ice cream place but a very good burger/sandwich place too.

Very nice staff and very courteous.

Only cons : lot less parking and street parking is also difficult to get.<//review>< user_name>

< review>
Fenton's Creamery is a historic ice cream parlor and creamery that has been in existence since 1864. I am a late comer to the glory of Fenton’s Creamery. Sure I remember all of the hoopla of the ice cream shop being immortalized in Pixar’s  2009 animated movie  “Up”, but I never tried a scoop of the ice cream until 2018.   I am a fan of the black and tan sundae, three million  of these sundaes have been sold since its invention. There was a line forming out-the-door tonight just as people have been lining up since it  1st opened. I love this ice cream.<//review>

<Review>Ice cream here is bomb, I ordered a sundae and the kids chicken fingers...and this is what I got lol. I was thinking if you order kids chicken fingers it would be like 1 or 2 tenders (cause that’s what it sounds like), but instead I got some cheapass dinosaur nuggets instead lol. Maybe change the name on the website to kids nuggets. Bummer but oh well.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>They let you sample from a wide variety of in house made ice cream and the portion size was huge for the actual sundaes. We tried the Saddleback brownie and it was delicious. Legacy restaurant that's still as relevant as it was more than a century ago.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

One of the best, if not the best, ice cream shop and restaurant in the Bay Area. Not only is this place featured in the Pixar animated film Up but it defiantly lives up to the endorsement. The dinner and lunch food is tasty, not the best, but the ice cream, oh my goodness they do this well! All the ice cream is made in house, and is of the highest standard. If you get even a small scoop it will be more then worth your time. I love getting the Black and White with marshmallow on top. Only down side is the side is the parking lot is tiny. I usually park on the street and walk a block or two.
Going back for my birthday and a few friends, never regret it!</Review>

extremely tasty. I am happy I finally got to try it. I like it way better than Cold Stone (there's is overly sweet/heavy to me and makes me feel nauseated ) Fenton's has a lot of flavour I especially loved their green tea icecream IT IS PERFECTION.< /text>

One of the best ice cream places I’ve been to, really good taste.  I made a mistake and ordered 4 flavors forgetting each flavor was a scoop 🤷🏿‍♂️.  The girl I was with did say I was tripping but hey, I thought I was right as usual haha<//text>

Fentons creamery is one of the best places to visit in Oakland.   The black and tan with toasted almonds is amazing and the sundaes and shakes are great.    The burgers are good and everything wlis well cooked and presented, fries and extras are plentiful.  The atmosphere is like a classic ice cream shop and it's a nice play to visit with family.< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>There are tons of flavors to choose from at this classic ice cream parlor that’s been scooping up sweet delights for decades. Straightforward American diner fare is also available but it’s mostly there so you can feel like you’re having dinner before you indulge with dessert. One of my regular orders is mint chip ice cream with cold caramel, and I sometimes don’t fool myself about having a meal and just get ice cream.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Fun place with a family friendly atmosphere. The menu has plenty of variety including burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Their icecream desserts are fantastic! Overall it's a touch on the expensive side, especially for a scoop of icecream, so you might want to save a visit for a special occasion.< /Text>< GmapID>

Sooooo yummy!! The food (non ice cream) is delicious and I think sometimes overlooked. And of course the generous helpings of ice cream are DELICIOUS and famous as not only a bay area must for foodies but also made famous by Disney Pixar's movie Up.<//Text>

Fenton’s will never disappoint, they have amazing food and ice cream! Also, my daughter loves the fact that we go to the ice cream shop that’s in Up! The prices are super affordable, and it’s always busy. The only downside is the parking, it’s so small so if you are getting close to the restaurant just start looking for parking.<//review>

Very popular spot. Floats were SO good as were the fries. Service was super friendly, but slow. The vibe is great, just what you'd expect. Can't speak for the rest of the food, but people sure seem to love it there. Do your best to snag a spot in their parking lot.<//Review>

<time>1496674225214<//time><rating>5<//rating><review>Perfect for all your all-day or late-night sweet tooth cravings! Great for group outings and celebrations. You definitely get that family-owned feel.

Just want a scoop (or why not two) of your favorite flavor? Don't be intimidated by the perpetually long line pouring out of the front double doors. The uber-friendly staff keeps the line moving fast and people going in and out quickly with their decadent desires?

Or maybe you want something to eat or a more adventurous treat? You and your group can take a seat and order from a variety of parlor foods and treats, from classic burgers to shakes and pies. Of course, the main attractions are the MASSIVE sundaes that Fenton's is famous for. My friends and I were feeling quite adventurous and celebratory (it was one of their birthdays), so we split a Banana Special, the featured sundae on the menu. When they say "three HUGE scoops of ice cream", it's really an understatement. What we got looked more like three whole pints really, all over a sweet, ripe banana and topped off with strawberry jam, chocolate, pineapple, whipped cream, and a cherry. It was outright delicious and filling, and I'm sure glad we had a team to finish it.</review>< pictures>

<review>Have come here few times for ice cream and couple times to eat a bite!

Food is 3.5 stars, old school burgers, sandwiches and other items are pretty decent. Ice cream is quite nice although i only like few choices that are light otherwise most of the stuff is pretty heavy, though it's homemade style so all good ;) Old time favorite is the junior size black tan sundae and the petite size scoop of caramel crunch :)

Place is usually busy no matter the season with enough indoor seating and few seats outside with a cute little fountain. Bathrooms are neat and clean most of the time.

Service is quick and super friendly :)<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpcC4fzqudkPEKdkQD824WLIm5DHiCUoN8AHSj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZauki6VD8kuMmBbIqCYdcFHYlUwMISdeJkC0v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFVD__SimT9XsuuziQLpK-PGooseVdcgbkRlPw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyJox3RMCE7SpLf_Tek6HNImeVBkuyYVWBDcvV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQUmauVZmPBab7ZD2wZjSohBlKqUHZvY2u1Z5x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdaAHJkiJ4yZO_yAZ5IWf-gw_8eBT9Fp4nMm1h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6V7t2DjnMZ4ZnPT-JHKUnIiwlVG-7ZcpFsasj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv0graqgWL7j0mNsWd889gRaQRy8nihQceca8m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

This place is an Oakland staple. Nice for families with kids or any ice cream lover. I ordered the petite sundae with marshmallow topping. It was huge for a petite and truly hit my sweet spot. They also have a nice dinner style menu. Staff was very friendly and service was good. We didn't order food but could see  the portions were large. Small parking lot and metered parking on the street.<//Review>

Fenton's is incredible. The portions of ice cream they give you are absolutely ridiculous, but the quality is top notch. Just remember, if you are ordering a signature sundae, you can easily split one between 4 people. Also, if you want something savory, they have diner classics like grilled cheese, fries, burgers, etc.<//text>

<Text>Good : A great family resturant. Very american style food that is always delicious. The menu has healthier and les healthy options to cater to all. Fentons has a nice feel of an old ice cream parlor. A perfect spot for a child's birthday party as they do sing and give an ice cream treat.
Also was featured in the Pixar movie "up", which is a fun fact!

Bad: Acoustics are bad and it gets very loud inside, so not a great place to have a first date or chat with family or friends. Also the tables are very small and cramped (especially in groups of four). Usually pretty crowded. Parking is also difficult to find so expect to walk a bit.< /Text>< pictures>

Busy restaurant/ creamery.  Small parking lot, some available pay street parking.
Great icecream flavor, generous scoops, good service,  price is reasonable. Try their heath bar, caramel and pecan, and strawberry cheesecake flavors icecream.<//Text>

A great place for date night. This was where generations of dates had met for dinner and ice cream - especially massive, homemade sundaes to be shared by two or more patrons. With lines in the evenings and a variety of original viands, I've always enjoyed the food here, often in the company of family and friends.<//review>

With so many reviews it feels like adding to it at this point is just talk. This was my first visit, and during Covid. I didn't mind waiting in line, wish the inside was open to have the best creamery experience. The service and staff was friendly, and they all were hustling. Why the 3 stars? For the price of a scoop of ice cream, it's overpriced and much smaller than what a traditional creamery would serve. Tastes great, but disappointed with the serving size.<//text>

Wonderful ice cream and hamburgers!  We purchased that the Banana Particular, despite all of the warning signals about its large size.  However, I must acknowledge the ice cream tastes are priceless.  Rich, creamy, yummy.  We turned out some original tastes for tastes like banana, chocolate, coffee, and oreo and extra strawberry and caramel sauce on it.  It had been MIND BLOWINGLY GOOD.  And we could complete it one of five individuals, a plus! The chips were fantastic.  Salty, crispy, whatever you might want at a fry.< /Review>

<user_name>Miriam Smith<//user_name><review>First time here. Wow! Waited 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad for a Sunday afternoon. Dining area is loud; don't come for the ambiance, lol. Ordered turkey bacon melt with onion rings. Melt was delicious, the grilled turkey and salty bacon mellowed by the swiss cheese. Onion rings were crispy and flavorful. Not sure what they dredge it in, but it's tasty.
Ordered a Black & White Junior which, surprisingly, wasn't as sweet or rich as I thought it'd be. The vanilla ice cream was smooth and tempered the richness of the chocolate ice cream. The marshmallow and fudge were balanced with the whipped cream. I probably should've ordered the regular size.
Hostess was friendly. Staff was helpful and checked my table often.

Two things to keep in mind:
1. The parking lot is extremely small for such a well-known and busy establishment. Be prepared to park somewhere along Piedmont and walk.
2. This is not an inexpensive eatery. Be prepared to drop bills. I was part of a party of four. Our bill topped out just over $100 before tax and tip. But it was worth it, if just for the privilege to say, "I've eaten there."</review><UserId.>113091130672951483434</UserId.></record>

Service ok but the taste of my peanut butter chocolate ice cream was bland and different.  Too many plain whole peanuts and a few small chunk of chocolate.   It was always great but not this time.  I'm disappointed.
The tuna melt was ok.< /review>

I was in this area for an appointment and had some time to spare so decided I should stop here for an ice cream cone.  First happy thing was that they have a parking lot so no need to search.  Then I perused their list of flavors and decided on Pistachio.  Although I had a cone I decided to take a spoon to help me along.  When I put that first spoonful in my mouth I could not believe the taste.  It was fabulous!  It was remarkably creamy, had lots of pistachio nuts and the flavor was like nothing I have ever had before.  It might have had touches of almond or lemon along with the pistachio.  Whatever it was, I loved it!  I don't think I had ever been here before but, if so, it was over 30 years ago.  I have to have a return visit now!<//text>

Our love for Fenton's over the years has never been as strong as today.. Pandemic or not.. their commitment for servicing the community with same passion and flavors as usual.  It's outstanding.. because it's not just going to get a scoop of ice cream..No!  You are going to get Fenton's.💕🍧🍨<//Review>

Great ice-cream choices!  Pretty decent choices of food as well.  Your bill will surprisingly be on the right side of the spectrum because everything is on the pricey side.  Overall, quality of food and service is very good!  Family friendly is a huge plus!</review>

<review>I wanna try them when it's not take-out only. I pre-ordered and they are obviously very popular because I still ended up waiting in line for 30mins(there was two lines, about 15-20 ppl in pickup line and a line around the block for people who was ordering there.)

Of course with the wait food isn't too hot but overall the food was good.</review>< resp>

Loved their home made ice cream and delicious sandwiches. The best place for me where I had the memories with my late dad. Bring back happy memories. Their sundaes never fail to comfort me and give satisfaction.< /text>

<Text>Excellent ice cream and a great looking vintage building.  My son only had a take-out cone, we did not have a sit down meal.  The counter staff are very friendly and they are understanding with needing a little time to make a flavor choice.  I would visit here again on my next visit to Oakland.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Awesome place to come get some food and desserts! Don't let the line fool you, they have a separate line for to-go ice cream orders with a wide variety of flavors. Their sit-down section is the rest of Fentons and they have a menu for hot foods with something for everybody. Come here on an empty stomach and be prepared to share the desserts! The sundaes definitely run on the size of extra large! Service is really fast and the waiters are helpful when it comes to helping you decide which flavors you want. Parking lot is small but there's plenty of street parking nearby.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXqLAPnjJbj3zqd-x8yOGPzZpAtxV-8fMlOI8p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None<//response><username>Lily Dang< /username><Gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<Text>This ice cream was too die for on our vacation. You can see what we got in the pictures and I wanted to say if you wanna ice cream like this you’re going to have to go inside and sit down but other than that you have to take your ice cream to go...... also I want to say that this place sells food so if you wanna go get lunch and grab a dessert. Do your thang!</Text>< pics>

Always great service and delicious ice cream.
Their portion sizes are huge. Over the years I've gone from junior sundae to splitting a small sundae with my boyfriend.< /Review>

Great food, great ice cream, great ambiance, great service. Order the Sundae of the Month and be prepared to receive a bowl of ice cream as big as your head.

Two logistical items to note when planning your visit to Fentons: 1) When they get busy (which is almost all the time), they won't seat you until all members of your party are there. 2) Finding parking can be extremely difficult.

If you're looking for t-shirts and other souvenirs, visit  "Myrtle's Lodge", Fentons' official gift shop, across the street.< /Review>

If you like LARGE portions of ice cream...COME HERE. The prices have gone up quite a bit. I grew up near here, would go here often. When I was home visiting one time, my mom told me some shocking news...FENTONS IS CLOSED????? What???? This can't be??? If any of you remember when a fire happened here.

I do remember one time when I went here and with one of the servers here at the time. The service was TERRIBLE...that was then, this is now.
Fenton's is like the Six Million Dollar Man...we can rebuild Fenton's..updated, cleaner, and still THE BEST ice cream.

I can remember when the BIG sundaes were $5.00 a pop, now the sundaes are $15.00 a pop. Fenton's still rules.  And thanks to the movie UP for making this place famous.<//text>

Love this place!  It a family tradition of ours to celebrate the beginning and the end of school by coming here and getting ice cream. We've been doing that for 20 years or so now.  My one complaint is the back room where large groups are sat.  It's a really loud room amd people sitting right next you can be hard to hear. I attached a photo of what was left of my banana split.< /Text>

Party of 10 didn’t make a reservation, so that our fault, but we were told it would be an hour wait. One of the hostess or waitresses told us they had a clog in one of the bathrooms and soon as that was sorted out they were start clearing tables faster?! Wth... An hour and 40 minutes later our party was finally seated, but we were too irritated so my wife and I left...<//review>

Usually is crowded, good service, even though it took longer time of the usual to get my hamburger.
Hamburger has good flavor, kind of expensive, same for the desert, an ice cream.

I recommend it.< /Text>

<Text>This is a favorite and has been all my life.  My parents even went on dates here.  While I miss the old yellowish coloring that seemed to cover the inside years ago, it is a very clean somewhat timeless look with a few key elements like the candy drop shape of the lights and the wire chairs that still remind me of the past.  The ice cream as always was huge and delicious.  Prices for a huge sundae are not cheap but it is a treat and not something to do all of the time.  We were very lucky and found parking in the lot which only holds about 7 or 8 cars.  We also were lucky on timing because we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to seat 4.  This is a landmark for the East Bay Area and has been immortalized in the movie "Up".  If you are in the area and enjoy a really great sundae with excellent ice cream, you really should try to visit Fentons.<//Text><user_name>Brad Hunter<//user_name><rate>5< /rate>< response>

<review>One of my all time favorite places. Been coming here since I was a teen. The serving size can't be beat, nor the quality of ice cream. My hubby and I like to share the sliders and a Jr. size banana split! When it gets hot out our way in the San Ramon Valley, we head for Oakland just for this treat!!< /review>< pictures>

We were given samples of different flavors we were deciding on, but we did have to ask rather than having the option offered. All in all a tasty creamery but not the best I have ever had.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30<//Gmap_id></record>

Wow! This place is amazing! Friendly, fun servers, great atmosphere & so many great ice cream flavors & combinations to choose from. The quality of the ice cream is outstanding. The milkshakes are delicious, banana splits are huge, perfect for sharing. Great place. Love. Love. Love.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>There's two different ways to do Fentons.

Option 1 - to go. The right side when you enter is where you'll line up, try a couple of different flavors and then decide what flavor you want and head out. Maybe sit outside on one of their benches or tables. Or walk along Piedmont Ave.

Option 2 - sit down. Their menu has not only various desserts like banana splits and sundaes but also diner food like sandwiches and fries. It's got that old-school diner feel. The service is okay but also just a nice place to catch up and grab dessert.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>One of my favorite Ice cream spots. The portions are big and delicious in both ice cream and food. My BF first time going, so he was excited. We got there close to 11pm on a Saturday night he was shocked to see how crowded it was. Although service was fast, it seemed like it took forever. My sundae had no caramel or hot fudge it was all on the plate instead of on my banana split. If you could call it that because I literally only took 3 bites of banana. I'm used to going and getting a HUGE sundae I expected my banana split to be bigger. Disappointed this time but that does not change my love for them.</Text>< pics>

Slow service. The server wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. The fries were old and cold as we're the onion rings. We were charged the adult price for a kid's meal. People that were seated after us, received their meals before us. We had to tell the server several times it was someone's birthday and we wanted the staff to come sing Happy Birthday. The food was like 2 out of 5. Oh and the kicker, she couldn't tell me the price of a scoop of ice cream on a cone. The banana split was  a 5 out of 5.</review>

Food was great, ice cream was great. It was a super busy day for them and we waited almost 2 hours to get in. You know people love it when the line just for ice cream goes clear down the block. I think we waited longer for ice cream than we did for our food. Friendly service and fun, noisy environment!< /text>

I've tried many things of their menu and never been displeased- high recommendation and my favorite place to eat (dinner and ice cream!). I suggest getting a sundae or something more deluxe rather than a scoop of ice cream.</review>

<text>Oakland is the home town for my family, and Fentons has been apart of that, we have ALL been coming here since my family immigrated to the USA from Norway in 1928. If you are from Oakland you know this place, great for family and friends, classic ice creamery. So many of my childhood memories are from there and we are continuing to make sure this generation also has those memories. Thank you Fentons and your crew for being part of so many lives throughout the years.</text>< Gmap_id>

A great place for quick diner food, but it's really about the ice cream here. Fenton's is super open to dining in for only dessert/ shakes/ sweets. Be sure to bring friends because the ice cream portions are huge!</review>

Favorite spot to celebrate a special occasion or to treat friends! Friendly staff and good food, including their salads, but it can be hard to hold conversations during peak hours since this place can get busy. Of course, you can just stop by to get a cone or cup of ice cream, made on site and wide selection of flavors (toasted almond my fav). Parking can also be tough to find during dinner hours.< /text>

<Text>Great food AND amazing ice cream - how much better can it get!  Well, if there was a parking garage nearby that would help but I will gladly brave traffic and the parking gods any day to go to Fenton's.  I've been going to this original location for 20+ years and it still is unbelievable.   The ice cream is made in house and during the day you can actually watch the process thanks to the giant windows they have now in front of the area.  My favorite is the coffee ice cream with hot caramel.  I don't even drink coffee and this is my favorite flavor at Fenton's!  But I think that hot caramel on just about anything is super tasty.  For the savory side you have American diner fare but super fresh and surprisingly (well to me, at first) crave worthy.  Anything they have is delicious: fried food, salads, burgers, sandwiches, everything!  Must go if you are in the area or not.  It's an institution and immortalized in Pixar's Up though on the most recent visit - don't know where Doug the dog went.</Text>< Pics>

The best. You could travel the globe in search of better ice cream than Fentons and it would be futile. Swiss Milk Chocolate ice cream is a miracle.<//review>

I would recommend maybe only stopping in for a quick bite of ice cream , or the French fries.  I hate French fries but these were amazing.

Super good ice cream and some waiters where great but one waiter took way to long because he was flirting with a waitress he did not get a 25 dollar tip who did get the tip was a young buser who was doing a great job at his job i hope she gets a promotion and a raise she is just as sweet as the banana jr. That i ordered. Which i highly recommend.< /text>

If you're looking for a charming old school diner/ice cream parlor you'd be hard pressed to beat Fentons. Quaint neighborhood with good food and friendly staff. Parking is pretty limited so be prepared.<//Review>

Great ice cream, and quick service at the counter. The restaurant was full, and had a long wait to be seated, so we just went to the counter to get our ice cream. They were friendly, and the ice cream was delicious.< /Review>

This is the place to go if you want to spend $30 a person for burgers and sundaes. Ok. Maybe pricey. But the portions are beyond huge and the quality is great. A definite experience.</Text>

<review>Love Fentons. I visit whenever I'm in the area. Tough to get parking in very crowded neighborhood. Ice cream treats are generous servings, even the petite sizes are generous. Worth the wait and hassle of parking.</review>< Pics>

This is a great place to visit with a large party. We had a large group of around 30, and had reserved tables in their large room at the rear of the restaurant. The staff were courteous, and friendly. The savory meals are delicious, but the desserts; well, it is called Fentons ice-cream. Treat yourself one day. Go hungry, and fill up on a huge Sundae.</review>

A nice icecrem theme restaurant, great for children or family gathering. However, watch out your car parked on the street even though it looks like a nice neighborhood. Our brand new rental car was broken in and everything was stolen. A police report was filled, no result.</text>

<Review>Good food & ice cream. Very tiny parking lot that's always full & hard to find street parking, it'll be nice if this restaurant was located in a shopping center with a huge parking lot like Alameda. Also if you bring kids, I suggest that you don't order them the nuggets because it taste like the oven cooked nuggets that you can buy from the frozen section in a grocery store. The burgers, fries, & sandwiches are delicious.</Review>< pics>

<text>Went here with friends when I asked for a good homemade ice cream joint! Place was packed but we were seated immediately!! Watch out what you wish for, though: I ordered what I thought was a simple sundae and got a dessert as big as my head, which was absolutely delicious but which I couldn't finish without help!! Great place for birthdays, especially since we sang the song for 4 different parties!! Awesome selection!</text></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Cannot go wrong with a dessert at Fenton's! The best is getting their current sundae special---mountains of ice cream on cookies and/or brownies inevitably the ice cream equivalent of ankle deep in hot fudge it caramel topping. One can easily be shared among four with everyone still getting a generous amount. And they allow swapping out ingredients or creating your own.

Oh and they have food, but why are you wasting precious stomach real estate on that??< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30< /GmapID></record>

One of my friends invited me to come here for the first time and I thought it was similar to other ice cream places in the area where you just wait in line to get ice cream and then go. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they have a diner and you can order normal food and then get a dessert afterwards.

The dessert menu is vast and they have some local favorites that are really nice. They are also humongous and I didn't know this so my friend and I both ordered a dessert to share and it was massive. Even after working on just a dessert both had to get packed up and taken away. It was part of the fun trying to figure out how to stuff our faces with ice cream.</Text>

the way ice cream is served is not very good. difficult to eat. scoops are larger than the container and lots of it drips before its finished. the flavor was not what I ordered. and the ice cream quality is not great. its fame is only because of the size of the ice-cream not the quality nor service not even price.< /text>

<text>It's a good ice cream shop, but I wasn't particularly wowed by it. Overall it was good tasting ice cream with a good creamy texture but nothing phenomenal or outstanding. This place probably gets more out of being a historic place than the taste of the ice cream itself. Still if you want good ice cream, you can't go wrong with this place either. Pricing was also decent for the amount you get.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>I ordered an ice cream cake on the phone on 6/8, and when I went to pick it up on 6/22, they had the order but not the cake! They told me they had a note that said they should call me back and tell me they couldn't make my cake, but that they hadn't gotten through to me. I checked my call history and confirmed they'd never called.

The manager was kind and offered a gift certificate for next time, but I declined because I don't think I'll be back.

I can't figure out what happened, but it seems likely that they got my phone number wrong when I ordered over the phone (even though they read it back to me). Maybe the person trying to call couldn't read the handwriting of the person who took the order. Seems like it'd be worth the extra trouble to make sure this doesn't happen when you only support ordering over the phone (and by fax, which... seriously?) Online ordering would have prevented this.

Really wish this had worked out; their cakes look great! But I was counting on them and they let me down. If you're going to give them a try, call them a second time a couple days before you plan to pick up!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Wonderful selection of ice cream with changing seasonal specials. The portions here are XL and the price is very reasonable for the amount of ice cream you get. They also sell single scoops for the less hungry. The diner portion is also good food, but the ice cream is the star as the name implies!< /Text>

Love love love Fenton's! Only downside to this location is parking, as the assigned lot is tiny. So you might have to park a little far, but it's always worth the walk to us. The creamery itself is just great - I love the aesthetics. Just a fun place! Ice cream is the best part but the food is pretty good too. Highly recommend!<//review>

We miraculously found parking one block up. Got seated, party of 4, immediately on a busy Sunday at just after 5 PM. We could not have had better service or ice cream, floats, and sundaes! It took a little while to take our order, but being our first time here, we had to look over the big menu anyway.</Text>

<text>It is THE PLACE for enjoyment. Usually one has to wait outside till the place is available inside. We were lucky - we didn't have to wait. The food is good. The best is "Varieties of Ice-cream". We asked for "triple Sundae with Banana split" - and what we received was a mini-mountain that we could eat with extra-long spoons from all the sides.
The atmosphere was that of a joyful festival, the staff was smiling, happy, and most cordial. That's one joint, I will visit again.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

We’ve enjoyed Fenton’s for more than 45 years as a couple, having visited Oakland and Vacaville hundreds of times. If you enjoy exceptional house made ice cream with three signature flavors, Toasted Almond, Swiss
Chocolate, and Rocky Road and 49 other flavors you owe to yourself and your loved ones to visit this 125 year old Oakland landmark.

By the way, Sunday July 21, 2019 Black and Tan Junior sundaes are $1.25, a remarkable savings. I encourage you to visit often. By the way, I had a bowl of chili today. It was very good. All sandwiches, salads, and menu items are very good.

Visit the back and watch them make ice cream and other treats.< /review>

This place is amazing. We came in with a large group fairly close to closing time on a busy sat night. Employees all friendly and welcoming, service fast and efficient. Ice cream was spectacular. I'm still enjoying leftovers.<//Review>

Overcooked and dry burgers and buns, standard frozen bag fries, pretty underwhelming service, especially for the prices.

On the up side, the malt was excellent, and the onion rings were (although again frozen bag standard) cooked just right.

Perhaps it was just a fluke that day, but doubt I would drop nearly 90 dollars for 4 people for burgers and fries and a malt again there.</review>< pics>

<Review>I've been going to Fenton's since 1950 or before when it was on 41st and Howe.  We would stop after parties, dance lessons or dates.  My husband and I would have our favorite Rocky Road cone every weekend.  We were married for over 60 years.  He would tell the waiters he remembered paying 25 cents for a milkshake when he was a boy. Good memories and I'm still meeting my family there.</Review>< response>

Fentons...what can I say? I had a crab salad sandwich on sour dough and it was as good as I remembered it. Though not today, I've eaten their hot fudge sundae and swooned. Great place for families but like other eateries on Piedmont parking is challenging. Your patience is rewarded!< /Review>

Been coming here since the '70s thanks to my parents. My favorite is the Deviled egg sandwich and a Swiss Milk Chocolate malt with extra malt, extra old fashioned whip cream, and extra thick! The wife loves the chili bread bowl and a petite Sunday with cold caramel.</text>

<Review>An East Bay classic! If you're coming for dessert, come hungry because the portions are huge and you'll want to lick your dish clean. The real caramel is a special treat!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30<//Gmap_id>< pictures>

A bit crowded. Finding parking is difficult. Made a mistake of reading only the sign with the different options of ice-cream. They have some more on the side which aren't indicated on the board. Free testing available. But because of the rush you might need to choose quickly.</Text>

<review>Best ice cream I've had in a very long time! Employees were all very friendly and helpful. The night we went, they were very crowded, yet we still received our order fairly quickly. I had the Dutch chocolate chip ice cream which was really rich and delicious! Only tip I could give would be to please open up the entrance somehow, there wasn't much room whatsoever, I can only imagine how uncomfortable someone with claustrophobia would feel. Nice fun place with an exciting atmosphere.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The service is top notch...and I must say that the employees really like their jobs and each other and it's obvious when someone comes in for their shift.  It's like they are all close.  Gotta love that.

Loved the food and the ice cream was enjoyable too!  It is definitely loud in the restaurant but I liked that I didn't have to worry about how loud the kids were being.  Wait staff did seem frenetic at times but everything got handled efficiently and the order was correct.  Would definitely recommend a visit if you are in the area or for a fun outing.</text>

This ice cream parlor is maybe more famous than it is good, but it's got an outstanding reputation, so I'm definitely not saying it's bad. The servings are huge, so I recommend sharing a sundae unless you're truly committed to an act of gluttony. Expect a line on most evenings, and to hear "Happy Birthday" sung several times.<//review>

<review>Great ice cream and classic American food. Huge portions of ice cream are their specialty in their many variants of sundaes. Do go beyond chocolate because their other flavors are delicious and a real strong point. If you don't want ice cream, their sliders and fries are excellent. Fenton's is a well-deserved East Bay institution.</review>< UserId.>

Fenton's should get 5 stars but I only gave it 4. The place is extremely noisy and it is not a place where you go to have a business meeting.
They get so busy that they forget your food orders. We ordered a french dip sandwich that came after the banana split. We had to remind the server we were still waiting for our food. It was like forever.
I understand you go to Fenton's for ice cream but no one should have the dessert before the main meal.
Prices have gone up and the portions are huge but beware of a sugar rush.
You're better off getting a cone in the take out line.</Text>

Been coming here since college.
Good food,  esp. The French fries.
It's just kind of crazy that the price of a sundae is the same price as an entree.
Oh well...< /text>

<text>Fentons Creamery is definitely a must if you love ice cream. The sundae selection to choose from are to die for. My favorite is the blueberry cheesecake flavor ice cream, (SUPER TASTY!).

Fentons also offers many other items on the menu such as, burgers, salads, shrimp 🍤 po'boys and the list goes on...</text>< Pictures>

Great old time ice cream parlor with a wonderful food menu as well. For take out stay to the line on the right, the left line is for the restaraunt. Wonderful sandwiches and other lunch items. Tuna salad just right with not too much mayo. Don't forget dessert, great selections and plenty for sharing. Small free parking lot adjacent to the parlor.< /text>

We waited 2 hours for our food and it wasnt even that good when we finally ate. We wanted to try their famous ice cream but we couldn't stand to wait another hour or so to get it. Not worth it.<//Review>

Fentons was a great destination after my son graduated Kindergarten today! He had one thing on his mind which was getting a banana split. The food was great he ate dino chicken nuggets with fries, I had the yummy fish sandwich. After eating he got his banana split and ate it all up. We will definitely be back. Around the time we went like lunch time it was pretty quiet and alot of seats to choose from. Great service, Great time!</review>

This place is iconic for a reason. Very family friendly, but also a little too busy for my taste. If you go during peak times, be ready to wait a half hour or more to be seated. Also, the iceacrean portion sizes are MASSIVE. Do NOT underestimate the sizes. The sundaes WILL be larger than you think. I reccomend sharing between at least 3 to 4 people.<//review>

<Review>Great ice cream options. You can't really go wrong with any flavor they have.

When you get there will be a line out the door. Don't get discouraged. This place doesn't have a really good way to queue up the people waiting to get a scoop. Just find parking and then get in line. It moves pretty quickly.

If you're getting ice cream only (not eating in) there won't be a ton of options to sit and lounge. You may need to walk around or get back in the car and leave.

The food here is just really basic and average. But they make it up with the ice cream. The prices for everything is what you'd expect; nothing too high and nothing too low.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Amazing ice cream creations, most large enough to feed a few people. If you love ice cream, this is your spot. Similar to the creamery in Walnut Creek but I'd say a step above. Definitely worth the drive if you can find parking!</text><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

<Review>Everytime I go to Fenton's I bring someone new who has never been. Now known because of its cameo in UP, this charming place is also popular for its extreme ICE CREAM. While they serve food as well, be sure to remember to save room for dessert. A word of the wise, a "generous" scoop of ice cream is being modest! It's a great place to take kids while also a cute place to go on a date!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Long-established local Creamery with a wide selection of ice creams sherbets and sorbets. They also have a fairly extensive selection of regular food items for those I feel guilty about eating dessert first. In addition to their regular selections they have seasonal, monthly and daily specials of somewhat more exotic ice cream. Parking is somewhat difficult to come by at this location.<//review>< pictures>

We went there during a busy Saturday afternoon and despite a good number of people there we got seated in 10 minutes. The kids got banana split and Sundae (from kids menu), the parents crab salad sandwich. Everything was very good, service was great and kind. Anyway it's not a cheap place :)<//Text>

<review>I had dairy-free strawberry sorbet and it tasted somewhat of freezer, not totally fresh. For the price paid, I didn't think it was worth it. My friends had ice cream sundaes with bananas, which tasted fine but would have been eaten more easily in a wider dish. The service was prompt, however and the place has a pleasant old-fashioned atmosphere.</review>< resp>

The way to uplift a tough day is with 2 Scoops at Fenton's Creamery. We drove from Santa Cruz and it was well with it!<//review>

Wonderful place to go. Fresh and yummy ice cream every time I go. Parking can be hard at times so I suggest carpooling or taking public transportation. There is seating outside if the inside is full. I highly recommend the black and tan but order it with all toasted almond ice cream, it is the best!< /Text>

Went there for dessert but decided to get a burger also. I was so pleasantly surprised. The burger was cooked perfectly, the bun to meat ratio was great.  It was a very nice meal. I ordered the milkshake but I was expecting a much larger size as one would normally get in an ice creamery.</text>

<review>We were a party of 9 celebrating my granddaughters birthday and the cute little girl who was our server could have been a little better and attended to us a little more considering her 18 percent tip was added on there assuming because we had a party of 9 .
When you know someone is paying a great tip you should give full service in attending to their needs .. She forgot 1 persons water which we kept waiting for her to come back by our table to ask again when a boy was kind enough to offer . Teach the young to pay attention ! Other than that the food was great and the ice cream was yummy .. we are going back to do this again and hopefully the service will be just a bit better ..< /review>< pics>

Ice cream was of course, great, but the service was lacking. We waited 40 minutes for entrees and then only got some of them and they arrived at different times. One of us had a undercooked burger and the other had desert arrive before anyone got food.< /Review>

Can't go wrong with a Fenton's sundae. I've tried burgers and the crab sandwich here and I like them both. If you're looking for something light to eat, the crab sandwich is good. Otherwise go for a burger. There's lots of different permutations that you can try. In addition to that, there's all the regular American diner fare: fries, milkshakes, chili dogs, etc. At the end of your meal you should definitely get a sundae.</text>

What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? A classic spot, great for birthdays and special occasions that don't demand ambiance or a dress code. The sundaes are ENORMOUS, so I recommend sharing. The food is incredibly mediocre; this is a dessert spot.</text>

The ice cream here is so tasty. I have only been here twice, it has been pretty busy both times. I brought people with me on the two separate occasions and they really enjoyed the sundaes. The service was really friendly and I can't get over how yummy the cookie dough ice cream is. This is a simple flavor, a classic, but the cookie dough is perfect. I would recommend this place for families, it is a big building bustling with ice cream lovers.< /text>

Delicious ice cream! The people working there were fine, not amazing. But I didn't go to the creamery for service ;D. I got the pomegranate one and it was great. The rest of my family got mango, pistachio, and Dutch chocolate. Would totally go again to try some more flavors! :)<//Review>

Wow this place can fill you up! When you come near this place in your car you can see the crowd flooded outside you know it's going to be good. This place gives hints of having an old fashioned vibe, you can notice it is  furnishings,  decoration, and in serve wear. The "Banana Special" is gigantic, in the menu they mention hat tourists might snap photos of your desert, it's big, and the banana it's self is completely submerged into the ice cream.<//review>

Oh I just don't know what could possibly be said about fans that hasn't been said before but you know I mean let's face facts this is some of the best ice cream you can get around the Bay Area regardless of what the wait time may or may not be it's always worth it

Do you want to stand around for ice cream probably not is if I know is the ice cream going to make it all better yes so if anything just know that sending somebody it had to kind of get an idea of what the menu items maybe is a good idea but either way just waiting on line hold on tight and everything will be okay once you get that spoon in your mouth

I tried the other items here in terms of like the actual menu items and food and stuff and it's about as average as you would expect that don't come here for anything but the ice cream and I don't really see that changing any time in the near future

So yeah cream it up cuz you so deserve to taste the good life<//review>

Ice cream is good. Sanwiches good. Don't get the chicken strips for kids, they're just cheap boxed frozen ones that they heat up. Kiss wouldn't eat them.< /text>

One of my favorite places in Oakland. Its crowded and busy, all the time. It is worth the wait. The CrabMelt is amazing and I dream of them often. Soft grilled buttery roll packed with tasty crab meat.  The Mini banana Split is the way too go.<//review>

so good but the restaurant is pretty loud. they could incorporate more fabric or softer materials in the decor to absorb some of that echo-y noise that makes it hard to communicate w the waiters and other people at your table</text>

At the time of visit they didn't have flavors that I wanted to try. Therefore I stuck with coffee cookie dream as that would be my go to. I was hoping for some seasonal fruity flavors. They had cherry vanilla but when I sampled... it was just maraschino cherries mixed with vanilla :-/ outside of desserts I do also enjoy your solid food every so often.</text>

The service was great, our waiter was professional & kind, so was all the other wait staff we encountered...I willingly paid over $8 for a milkshake.  It was only ok, just not $8 good.  We ordered a basket of onion rings & the waiter brought us a metric ton of onion rings...the order of onion rings was $6.75.

My kids each got a kids ice cream cone, they both were more than the order of onion rings.

In fact all the non-ice cream menu items were the only reasonably priced items on the menu.

It was a nice place & obviously very popular but I couldn't figure out what justification there was to price their ice cream items so high.  It would be hard to come back knowing I could get the same caliber of ice cream for half the price anywhere else.<//text>

If you like heavy and dense ice cream, which is so sickeningly sweet you can't taste any flavor other than sweetness, and you like it in huge portions, then Fentons creamery might be the place for you.

Apparently, judging by how busy this place  is, a lot of people do enjoy this kind of ice-cream. Or maybe its also the nostalgic factor that makes it so successful. Personally, I've found their ice-cream mediocre and not very enjoyable.< /Review>

Amazing old fashion ice cream parlour. If you are close to the area at all it's worth the drive to stop at Fentons. Lots of huge sundae creations as well as a full food menu and friendly staff. Parking can be tricky as it's a popular place but it's WORTH IT!!! Take a jar of hot fudge home with you!</review>

Super close to the cemetery, so we can contemplate mortality and then have a fun lunch.  A lunch of a pastrami sandwich, 4 ice creams, chili fries a burger, 2 root beers and fish and chips for a fam of 4 will cost 100 bucks, so keep that in mind.  Roast beef and pastrami here are better with au jous, fyi.</text>

This place is the traditional American diner we need in the Bay area. Great burgers, hot dogs, cob salad, etc...

< Review>
Incredible ice cream. What can you say to put into words the rich and full flavor of these ice creams which are made on-premises? My favorites are coffee cookie dream and mint cookie.  Seasonal favorites of pumpkin pie ice cream and peppermint bark are also very highly recommened. Portions are big and a sundae can easily be a replacement for any meal. 😀👍< /Review>

<Review>While the ice cream is smooth with the perfect texture, the flavors are lacking. The vanilla raspberry vanilla tasted like vanilla but not a rich enough flavor. The hot fudge topping was glorified chocolate syrup. The caramel topping lacks full flavor.< /Review>< Name>

Great family place always great atmosphere and the ice cream is world class. They need to put a creamery at the Oakland Coliseum.  If they had done that the Raiders would never have left.< /Review>

Three of us couldn't finish our fudge brownies sundae after eating only half of our sandwiches. Wish there was a way to take leftover icecream home...<//Text>< Pictures>

If I was judging the food, I would rate low.  But, let us be honest, you come here for ice cream.

The ice cream is good, large portions and a little pricey (but not bad).

Think slightly better food than a dinner, with giants delicous ice cream deserts< /Text>

This place is a landmark in Oakland, the business has been there for quite some time and become a family tradition to celebrate birthday's! The ice cream confectionery choices are delicious. Can't speak to the current food menu but if they still have the same crab sandwich from a ~decade ago I can recommend that also.<//review>

<text>Some days you can walk right in and sit at a table, other days the line is out the door and there is no parking and people waiting in the parking lot. Even so! don't just pass it up! Good things come to those who wait! It always moves way quicker than you would think, besides that a lot of people don't realize you can walk up and order a to go which is nice sometimes. The staff are busy but friendly. My grandparents went here when they first dated, I have always gone here since a little boy, and now my children come here. I have never had better ice cream anywhere else.< /text>< userid>

Where do I start...  If you're lucky to get a parking space, consider yourself fortunate.  Service was terrible.  Sat for 20 minutes before even getting a glass of water, then know one seemed to know who would take my order.  Another 10 minutes passed by.  Once my food arrived it was cold and rubbery like it had been sitting around already pre made and just warmed up but NOT.  Ordered a small one scoop hot fudge sundae for dessert.  That item alone was $10 bucks.  Everything was overpriced.  Waitress never stopped back to see if everything was okay.  Needless to say; "I will not be going back to this place"!!!< /review>

This is where they have the best ice cream sundaes  period. I have been coming here since I was kid. Were talking the 1960's and the ice cream  has not changed. The crab sandwich is also one of their classic sandwiches. Very good.</text>

One major problem with this place. Too much goodness to choose from for everyone in the family. Then sitting in the dining area will make you pre-plan dessert, but when there is too much to choose from that’s hard. One suggestion: make everybody order something different for dessert that way everyone can sample/share.< /text>

<Text>Ice cream coma... But so worth it!

The line gets soo long, but thankfully we came just before it started to get too long. So many options to chose from at the end hubs & I decided to share the monthly special, the warriors. We swapped the almond ice cream with black walnut which was extremely delicious. Filled with walnuts, it quickly became our favorite.

We should definitely have gotten the junior size because we couldn't even finish half of it. The portions are very Americana here. Think Texas big... But it's delicious, oh so delicious.

If you're an ice cream fanatic, like me, this place is your heaven! It's so worth the drive up to Oakland on a hot...< /Text>< Resp>

<Text>I love this place. Great ice cream and they also serve good food as well. The people there are always so nice and they also give samples for you to try so you can see what flavor to get. Parking is hard to find sometimes, they have a tiny parking lot that fits like 8 cars. I would recommend coming here late where street parking is free and available. The decor is cool, it's like a old fashion diner.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Wow, this place gets busy!  We came by on a Friday night (the last night our of exploratory trip in Berkeley/Oakland) and the line was about 20-25 people long.  Thankfully it moved pretty quickly.  Nice assortment of flavors - a good mix of traditional favorites (chocolate, vanilla, rocky road) and more interesting ones (peanut chocolate crunch, vanilla almond swirl).  Tasty, but not as good as Smitten IMO.<//Review></record>

Fenton's is an excellent soda fountain and restaurant with ample setting. They are popular so schedule your visit to avoid the crowds. They also substitute if anyone in you company has allergies.</Text>

<text>Really good place for ice cream, burgers and curly fries! Not a good place for a diet though!

I have been here a handful of times and it's usually pretty crowded, even at off-hours, but it's definitely worth the wait. They have excellent milkshakes and ice cream and the burgers and the curly fries are really good too!

It's perfect for kids and families. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!< /text></record></dataset><record>

I didn't get the Mango Icecream of my chice. I had then the Pinapple. It was more Lemon flavoured Vanila, though very nice in taste. I also had Kuki-do. Mmmm .  .  . Yummy that too !< /text>

As a diner its food is good, not the best, as an icecream place it's great. The environment and feel is also great. Highly recommend their Pie a la mode.< /Text>

The atmosphere and ice cream sundaes are classic Americana / Disney (perfect for a Pixar film!). The burgers are pretty good. But the other food I've eaten there has been just OK, and it's easy to walk out with a tab over $40 per person. I'll still go back though. Maybe just for the ice cream sundae this time.</text>

no matter whether it's morning afternoon or night they have amazing food, awesome servers in some of the best ice cream ever. Parking lawn is extremely hard so plan on parking on the street which means possibly having to walk a block or two but it's well worth the walk.< /Text>

Before the fire and amazing remodel the awning was yellow and sun burnt orange and the food was not particularly good. I was taken there 4 being student of the week at St Leo's Middle School and I ordered a burger. I regretted that decision for quite some time and took a while before I was able eat a burger anywhere. I'm sure that along with the remodel the food has gotten much better. But this is of course and Ice Creamery and not a burger joint so getting back to the ice cream I have no complaints it's actually quite good and I wholeheartedly recommend the black walnut or whatever derivative thereof is served.<//Review>

Fenton's has the best ice cream around so yesterday I decided to treat my grandson to a cone. What a horrible experience. When it was my turn the cashier looked at me like I was bothering him, never asking may I help you, what would you like or any normal greeting. We placed the order, he even seemed irritated during that encounter.  I paid and paused but did not get a thank you. I said "you're welcome" and asked the young man was he a new employee because he was lacking basic customer service skills. I told him when a customer makes a purchase you should say thank you. I've been going to Fentons for years and often take out of town guests but may never return if this is the new caliber of employees.< /text>

<rate>2<//rate><Review>First issue. They told us it would be around a half hour wait it took over an hour to seat us in the most uncomfortable chairs I think I have ever been in. Second issue. My $15 burger didnt come with fries they cost extra. My burger was dry and both the patties and the bacon where over cooked. Honestly the fries where the best part of my dinner and that's not a compliment. The dessert was good but nothing to go crazy over. This place is just over hyped. If you want to go only go for dessert they charge way to much for their meals that's would have Gordon Ramsay spitting it back on the plate.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This place is one of very few restaurants that actually have diabetic friendly desserts. They have two flavors made with Splenda,  vanilla and pecans something-or-other, sorry, don't remember exact name). All of their ice creams are homemade, they have milkshakes, and they have very good food.<//review>

One of my favorite ice cream shops! I don't get go here too often, but I always stop by when I'm in the area. They have a variety of ice cream flavors. You can dine in or take your ice cream out to eat. I've tried their ice cream flight, which is a choice of 3 different ice cream flavors or more.< /Text>

<Text>A local ice cream joint in a hip neighborhood in Oakland. The place is spacious with outdoor sitting, complete with fountains. There are plenty of seatings inside as well. Service was quick and painless to get your ice cream. Their scoops are huge, and I really suggest to just get petite size. It will be more than enough, trust me.

The ice cream was good, but not that mind blowing good. It's still better than most ice cream places I've been to though. I'd say don't make special trip here, but when you're in the area to do other things, do swing by and get some ice cream here. Maybe even sit outside by the fountain when the weather permits. Definitely a good experience.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>Anywhere from a 15 to 30 minute wait. Always a crowd inside. Parking is horrific. But the food the customer service and the atmosphere and food more than makes up for it. Fentons Creamery is what I would consider to be one of Oakland's many landmarks.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

My husband talked for years about this infamous banana split his dad used to take him to get after A's games.

It was delicious and worth it.< /Review>

The Swiss milk chocolate ice cream with cold carmel is the best of my life. Honestly, this place has the best ice cream I've ever had. Perfection. Portion sizes are massive. Service is nice but can take a while because this place is always crowded. Stop reading his review and just go!< /Review>

Fentons is amazing! All their food is pretty solid American diner-style food, but that's not why you come here. Let's be honest...it's all about the ice cream. They have a huge variety of sundaes, pies, flavors, and toppings. If you have not tried it, give it a chance. If you've been before, then you know why you need to come back.< /text>

The shiz. You can't ask for a larger "small" size of ice cream. This place is destined to make the world fat and I'm ok with that. One scoop at a time is what I keep telling myself.

Fenton's is your classic diner with good food and better ice cream. Get here and expect a little wait, even if it's just for the 'cream because this place packs up quick. Flavors are simple yet amazing and the best thing you can do for yourself is indulge! Get a sundae on a Sunday and plan to stay awhile because even the truest ice cream aficionados couldn't eat this 'cream quick.

If you've got kids take them on an ice cream tour - yes they do that here.</review>

Absolutely good food and just like it was 35 years ago. The crab melt is a must everytime.  Ice cream of course is required. You will not be let down. The staff are young and sweet. I am surprised how clean you can keep this place. Historical place that sweeps you back in time. I have stop when going through town.</Review>

Go here for that ice cream parlor experience- great flavors and generous servings - stray from that and you’re bound to regret it - some overpriced items I swear were pulled straight from your freezer or TV dinner.</Text></record>

Solid lunch and dinner menu, but the real stars are the preeminently shareable sundaes! Can be pricey, so if you're looking for price performance, just order a cone or two at the counter, rather than waiting for a table.<//text>

If you don't know what Fentons is then you should probably just go and find out. They do serve food there. I've never tried it but hear it's diner type food. Good enough. But what you're really going there for is their ice cream! They have tons of flavors and make all kinds of tasty (and huge) sundays! Just go, you won't regret it.< /Text>

<date>1465932520492< /date><Rating>5</Rating><text>On a warm Saturday afternoon, nothing beats a Black and Tan Sundae at Fentons. As long as you do not have to share it. :)

Parking is scarce. But you can generally find some where within a block.

It can be busy, but service keeps moving and is above average for a place as busy as this gets. Just set the correct expectations, servers are not going to get to you as fast when it is crowded as when it is empty.<//text>< Pics>

<user_name>Areca H'lael Smit</user_name><Review>I think it's the only ice cream shop I've been to that makes sherbet. Orange, raspberry, pineapple. A little too sweet, but still so good. Otherwise, they make an excellent vanilla and solid mint chip. It's usually so crowded, I almost never wait to eat in. This said, when I want to recall my youth I eat in and get fries and a milkshake...< /Review><rate>4< /rate></record>

Legendary Ice Cream. Coffee Cookie Crunch is the greatest. You really don't need to know more about this place. Also, if the line is long, just ask how long the wait is, looks are deceiving, they churn through people.< /Review>

<Text>Fentons has a variety of food and more importantly, desserts to offer and they do not compromise on size or deliciousness. It might be a bit pricey, but it's absolutely worth it! Great for groups of people, to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries. The Fentons Challenge is most definitely challenging, but don't hesitate to give it a shot!<//Text>< pics>

I had the banana split! It was amazing it is one of the few classic ice cream parlors around!

I love the fact that you can get one of the hats as a little souvenir! It's a great place to visit if you're a fan of the Pixar movie Up! As this is the ice cream shop that the movie bases it on :)</Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>My daughter and husband love to come here and get ice cream. I usually get a salad and sneak bites of their ice cream...lol. The ice cream is very good, a decent assortment of flavors, the salads are pretty good, the veggies are always fresh. The only issue I really have with Fentons is that it is not a comfortable place to eat, it's not terrible since we don't go there to sit down for a formal meal, but the chairs pink the hips, they are hard metal and everything echos so loudly since the floors ate marble the tables are marble topped and the chairs are metal. Being in there can be headache inducing at times, but again it's all about the ice cream and as far as that goes they ate doing a great job.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Classic ice cream shop! It's a sit-down place that also serves other food, but their ice cream involved food (milkshakes, sundaes, etc) are definitely the draw! All highly recommended< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<userid>104987932455782713675< /userid><Text>The ice cream here is the best in the Bay Area.  My favorite is the toasted almond.  They make great sundaes that are big and generous and can be shared with the whole family.  Sharing one big sundae is much more economical than getting the kids each their own cones.  Child cones are expensive (I think live $5 each) but I'll take my family of 4 kids there and we'll share a sundae for $10 instead.

As good as the ice cream is, I'm not a fan of their other food.  It's pretty basic burgers and fries type stuff and overpriced and not very good.  I gave it a 3 on food, but that rating was just for the ice cream.

Another good value is getting a prepacked half gallon to go.  They have a few flavors (fortunately one is toasted almond) that you can buy cheaper prepacked.  I think a prepacked half gallon is cheaper than a handpacked quart.

Sometimes we'll buy one of those and take it home and enjoy the ice cream and have more left over for the week.

When I've dined there the service has been poor.  More than once I've had to get up myself at my table to go pay my bill or to go get something that I need like napkins.  I think they have too few and too inexperienced servers working there covering too many tables.< /Text><date>1338556189827</date><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

Like most people, you probably know about Fentons through Pixar's UP, and what you'll find is some very good ice cream. If you dine-in, the food is pretty standard and fine, but the main attraction is, of course, the ice cream. The big sundaes are real big, but boy will you enjoy it. Be sure to look for Dug and a framed photo of Carl & Russel sitting outside of Fentons, and be sure to grab a paper hat!<//Text>

Fenton's is known for great ice cream and really fun place to go to for your birthday, especially for kids. Customers will join staff in singing Happy Birthday! (4 times on our last visit) Parking lot is really small, street parking is metered, but free a block away. Definitely recommend coming here, just get a cone if that's all you want and walk around Piedmont. It's almost always busy, a sign of how good it is!<//text>

I know the ratings this place had on Yelp, but the ice cream I ordered, (rocky road and mint chip), was really nothing special. I felt like the long wait wasn't worth it. It's obviously very high-quality ice cream, but nothing much more than that, in my opinion.< /text>

This place is an institution, but the food and ice cream are definitely not the best around.  This is clearly the place to be if you are a high school student on a weekend night.  Otherwise, you just feel old here.  But the milk shakes are really good!  And it has a parking lot, which is such a rare find in this area.<//text>

Another ice cream place that I have been going to for decades - no lie (I went before it burned down and after it was rebuilt).  The world's best ice cream, made right there on the premises.  I used to get the regular banana split when I was way younger (so much ice cream!), now I can only share a banana split jr. with my wife or I will go into a sugar coma.  My daughters love the place, it is crowded & noisy, good friendly service.  My favorite is dutch chocolate chip.  I will drive across the bay to get it, it is that good.<//review>

<Review>This is Oakland's premier old school ice cream parlor.  Can't beat the ice cream.  Sundaes are awesome, so are the root beer floats and shakes.  Food reminds you of an old school counter coffee shop.  This place was featured in the Pixar movie "Up".  Most east bay locals know about this place.  It's one of the very last traditional ice cream shops in the bay area.  Two thumbs up.<//Review>< Pictures>

This business has a fantastic following, so If you want a seat arrive early. Every time that I travel pass Fentons Creamery in the evening the people are standing outside waiting to enter. And the food is absolutely wonderful, from the Tuna Melt, to ice cream; be sure to wear loose fitting clothes. Lol<//review>

Poor and rude customer service! I ordered one scoop and they gave me two scoops but never fixed it when I asked about it and just charged me for 2. The waiter was impolite and refused to apologise for her mistake. Also the environment is extremely crowded and noisy! I've since found better options.< /Text>

I really like Fenton’s. It has an amazing list of ice creams and a decent diner menu. The servers were very nice! It’s not super cheap Incase you were wondering but worth it.
Just an fyi I don’t like their hot cocoa too thin (watery).</review>

<Review>This old-school ice cream parlor is a big deal in Oakland. The flavors aren't crazy, but they are well-made and delicious.

My complaint of Fenton's is the weird system of for-here/to-go. The natural thing is to order at the counter up front. However, if you order there, then you can't sit anywhere in the restaurant. They need to sort this out or at least give the counter-people somewhere to sit and enjoy their ice cream.</Review>< pictures>

<text>On a recent Baseball trip to Oakland, my wife and I made an effort to get to Fenton's for some of their world-famous ice cream.  The quality didn't disappoint:  Flavor, texture and quantity -- all the best.  For those worried about venturing into Oakland, rest assured, the creamery is in a safe and family-friendly neighborhood, with parking to be found on side streets.</text>< resp>

I had not been her for over 20 years. Things have changed a little but it is still ao good!  Food is generous and comfy and delicious,  but not as affordable as I remember. Ice cream is always awesome and huge! Staff is nice and accommodating. It is always packed with families and college kids. Parking is a challenge but so worth it!<//review>

<Text>Tasty, but portions have been shrinking over the last few years. What used to be a challenge to finish, is now sadly snack sized. Ice cream is still the start attraction, can't get enough of the caramel sauce.</Text><user_id>107095448378142135186</user_id><user_name>Matthew L</user_name>< Resp>

Parking is so hard to find here! They do have a small parking lot, but it's usually packed already! If you're just getting ice cream, I would definitely recommend doing take out. The line goes way faster!< /text>

This place is great!

I got a banana split and shared it and we still didn't finish it.

The parking lot is small. Really small so hopefully you get lucky or you find street parking.

There is tons of seating inside and some nice patio seating outside as well.

The price is expected for a speciality ice cream dessert.< /Text>

The ice cream is better than what you can get in most supermarkets, and service isn’t bad. I recommend getting a table outside if possible. Waiting for an indoor table can be a long experience.</Text>

I love this place!  I love the Blood orange ice cream, and the huge selection of ice cream in general! They're delicious!  The most memorable would the the marshmallow topping and the delicious crab sandwich! Be sure to try it if you're in the area!</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Fenton's is the your classic ice cream shop. Their massive sundaes, made with a wide range of fun flavors and rich homemade toppings are the thing of legends, but they've also got a serviceable selection of sandwiches, burgers, and other diner-style fare if you need to start with something savory.

Pro tip: ask for "cold fudge" instead of hot fudge. It's actually room temperature, and will help to keep that gigantic creation from melting before you can eat it all (you were planning to eat it all, right?)< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Decent ice cream, but for the price you get a really small portion. The petite size is one scoop, not like other ice cream parlors, where a scoop is really 1.5-2 scoops. Keep this is mind when I tell you that this single scoop is $4.<//Review>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Ice cream is amazing. Unique flavors. Massive scoops. Kids were of course in heaven. However, almost no parking. Very crowded. If you go back to the party area there is a mandatory gratuity of 18%. At first glance it looks like the tax. So make sure if you get party seating that you don't add more of a tip unless your server really deserves it.</review></record>

Uniformly amazing food, but a cannot-miss stop just for their massive ice cream desserts.  It's practically a rite of passage for Bay Area lifelong residents to go and get nauseatingly full on their first order, and everyone who can visit here really, really should!</text>

Good for nostalgic vibes and an americana experience. The sundaes are massive and decadent. The service can be slow, but the place is always busy. I’ve never tried the food, but it’s standard diner fare.<//review>

Great for dessert! The food was good but when my sandwich was ordered with no sauce and came with it anyway they only scraped it off. The atmosphere is lively and the staff is nice but busy!<//Text>

Pretty good ice cream. This is a very popular place and the line was super long to get ice cream. Lots of flavors to choose from. I didn't think the actual ice cream itself was that memorable though.< /Text>

The absolute best place in the East Bay for ice cream & the burgers are pretty good too ! Take the kids to the place featured in the last scene of the animated movie 'UP' & take their picture in front of the building for a memento ! Bring your credit card because it ain't cheap,but it's worth every penny ! An Oakland treasure!!!< /Review>

This place has some really great desserts, especially the sundaes.  The magic is lost with the whole view of the kitchen, which was not the greatest view to me, but may be something for others.  There can be a long line here since it's a famous establishment<//text>

<Text>Why do people go here? It can't be the ice cream because it isn't even good. I know it's not the food. To top it off there are 2 ice cream places within a block that knock it's socks off. Next time you roll up and see a crowd of idiots waiting to stuff their faces, head down to Lush and treat yourself to something memorable.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Holy moly that is good ice cream. Wish I lived closer so I could try them all including the rotating flavors. Possibly the best creamery I've visited! (it is pricy, but worth a splurge)< /Text>

<review>It's hard to rate, because the Ice cream is always 5 🌟 , but the food tends to be a little sub par, better food options in the area, but the food isn't terrible. I would say better than tolerable. Side Note: I cook very well so my bar is set kinda high.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>Don't be deterred by the long line serving the To Go custom.rs - it moves fast!   If there's a wait for a table, try the  bar stools with a top-notch view of the kitchen activity.  The sundaes continue to satisfy, and the extensive diner menu appeases every American palette (burgers, club sandwiches, chilli cheese dog, salads, pies, cookies, and of course--ice cream, LOTS of it!)  Time has stood still at this classic old-fashioned ice cream palour.  If you can't decide amongst the long list of sundaes, you won't regret the Black and Tan--extra hot fudge sauce on the side.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Make memories while they make you ice cream, before your very eyes if you want to go watch them do it. This restaurant represents probably the oldest and most consistent tradition in my family. So much good food, great desserts, and amazing memories. I got on the news once because I was eating there.< /Review>

Great old school style ice cream parlor! I really like it!! Highly suggest you go check it out and sit down if you can there and eat in.  They put some effort into their ice cream sundaes and it shows, they are delicious.  Go to destination for sundaes!< /review>

<review>Nostalgic and fun!! Fenton’s is an institution in the Bay Area. Home to Rocky Road ice cream. Fair warning, it’s usually crowded and there’s usually a wait, but so worth it!</review>< Name>

<Review>East Bay phenomenon widely known for hand made ice cream. Always crowded but the line moves quickly. parking can be a challenge on the street, their parking lot is small.
They also have a store across the street for candies and toys of all kinds.<//Review>< pics>

Great customer service and the milkshake was delicious but the paper straw throws off the taste and it is also a restaurant with a little ice cream stand by the front entrance if you just want ice cream. :)< /Text>

Its a family tradition to go here for their milkshakes, as my grandfather brought his three sons here, and in turn my father brought me and the last time I went the shake was creamy, thick and big enough to tide me through dinner and breakfast!
Enjoy!< /text>

I have been coming to Fentons for almost ten years. Tonight, I was sat down and for some reason, it took nearly 20 minutes to get our waters and to get our order taken. Usually, we order less than 5 minutes after being sat down. Meanwhile, people to my left and right, in front of me, and behind are getting served! Do they not like my hair? Sad!< /Text>

Stopped in for a waffle cone. Was underwhelmed by the flavor selections; about 12 variations of chocolate, chocolate-chocolate, and coffee with a few sherbets.
Great if you want the classics...go elsewhere for more variety.
Enormous portions on the waffle cone.< /Review>

<username>Jose Robleto<//username><text>Delicious, mouth-watering, to die-for-creamery. Words don't do enough justice of how great the ice creams are. You'll come back several times if you are visiting on your vacation. If you live nearby, good luck not going there often. When you saw Disney-Pixar "Up" at the end, Carl and Russell are eating ice cream, this is the creamery the animators are paying homage to. The location was always busy when I visited but they sit you quick if eating there or to-go too. Can't wait to back. Wish they had one in Los Angeles.< /text></record>

Amazing ice cream! Try the tan and white, the toasted almond ice cream is a must. But the chicken club was even better.</Text>

I felt like I was on the show "Cut Throat" The chef gives the plate of food to each judge. One of the plates of food in comparison is much smaller than the other. I couldn't believe we were served the same exact dish and one of the plates was smaller than the other... I was given the smaller plate... the food was good... The milk shake was awesome👏👏👏 I hope the next time it will be better... Thank you for the creativity and design of your restaurant...<//Review>

Don't waste your time on an average burger and fries. Ice cream sundae portion sizes are out of this world- order wisely. Always say yes to marshmallow topping.

<Response>None< /Response><text>I thought it to be a little pricey for a kids scoop of ice cream. It was about $5.00 for the small kids scoop. However, Danika and the other staff were really patient and helpful when we were ordering two ice cream cakes. The cakes we're awesome and reasonably priced. They accommodated our requests for custom cakes which exceeded our expectations. Warning...if you get a cake with black frosting be aware it will stain your hands, tounge, and anything else it might come into contact with haha we got a good laugh out of the way we all looked while eating it.<//text><Date>1522023703871< /Date></record>

<Review>Amazing ice cream, and soooooo many fun flavors and different sundays! The sandwiches are a bit pricey, but are an experience worth having at least once.
Building is a little dated inside, but that also gives it a very comfortable "old timey diner" feeling so it's not exactly a bad thing.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Fenton’s is well worth the time. I had a tasty French Dip sandwich, but the real reason to go, of course, is their fabulous ice cream.</Text>

Fenton's will always be a fun place to go. Whether it's a child or adult birthday, office party or middle of the week family dinner Fenton's is it. Thank you for a good crab sandwich and ice cream forever.< /Text>

Great place for kids but that does mean it gets loud when the place is packed, which is usually is. You'll want them there to help finish the monstrous servings of ice cream. Mornings are more quiet and they serve a great breakfast.</review>

It's sacrilege so say anything bad about Fentons but these days I just don't feel the ice cream is worth the wait and the noise. Perhaps I'm just getting more grouchy as the years pass (well, not perhaps it's true) but there are other ice cream places in the area, and other places to get diner type food.

Feeling better saying that I can say that the meals are average and the ice cream and ice cream concoctions are very good. If you're going to come try to come when it's not as busy so you don't have to wait too long for a seat or for your turn in line for a to-go treat.<//Text>

< review>
Melted goop with no subtlety. The guy getting our ice cream dropped the cup into the ice cream, peered at the ice cream adhearing to the outside of the cup with a mystified look, and apparently concluded that this customer would be delighted to have a bit extra for free.

Ordered a small and only ate a few bites before tossing it in the trash as a write off.  There's many better options even if they aren't featured in a Pixar movie.<//review>

<review>Walked off the street... service was immediate.  Ice cream was pricy, but the flavor was delectable (Dutch chocolate chip), very creamy and the single scoop was humongous.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Such a fun place to grab "Diner food" with friends, family or your date & ammmmazing ice cream.
Their monthly specials are always fun.
Sometimes there could be a long wait so call & check.
Parking can be a bit tricky. Arrive early if youre meeting someone & Good luck!<//text><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

This is what you want in an ice cream parlor. Handmade ice cream and treats, but the additional menu items make Fenton's a great destination. One of Oakland's little known secrets. I was taken here by my dad and I have taken my daughter.</Text>

<text>For families, or just lovers of ice cream, this is a great restaurant.  The ice cream counter in front scoops out big servings to those who just want a scoop to go.  For those looking for a meal, the restaurant serves up great burgers and sandwiches.  Very family friendly, you won't be able to go more than ~15 minutes without a recitation of "Happy Birthday."  Can be crowded, especially on hot summer days.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Unless you are taking some kids out for a treat after a T-Ball game - I don't get it. It's fine. But not worth the chaos unless you have a nostalgic relationship to this place.<//Review>

I'M sorry but he needs to decide fast.  We were waiting for our turn to be seated.  There's a lot of open seats but he is not even calling us.  He was answering the call, getting names of the next customers and he was ignoring us.  I asked him and told him when are we gonna seat, he couldn't answer me.  Finally there was this waiter who I talked to and I asked him if we can sit down down and he said yes.   Please teach this guy good customer service.<//text>< time>

<Text>I have been going there since i was 2 years old i am now 30. I have seen some improvements over the years. Still gets crowed on weekends, if you have alot of time to spare for to wait for a seat then that is great otherwise average wait time is 30 to 50 minutes in a weekend. I like the ice cream, and the caramel is awesome.</Text><gmap_id>0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30< /gmap_id>< Response>

<review>I know this place is iconic, but it is also a constant let down. There is always an excessive wait and it is apparent why. The service is always sub-par here, taking way too long to do anything. The poor service leads to people being at their tables for longer than is necessary. The portions are huge and great for sharing, but there isn't much special about the product other than excess. There are better places in the bay area to satisfy your sweet tooth.< /review>< pictures>

Definitely a must if your coming from out of town and a regularly visited spot by the locals. The creamery is a historical site and has been featured in Pixar's Up movie. Needless to say, the ice cream and shakes are what they're known for and also make sure to come with a group to share as the ice creams sundaes are HUGE!!!<//Review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>A staple for the area, and there's never a time to go when there won't be  line of excited people.

An old-school ice creamery, so there won't be any of those high falutin' flavors you're used to from Tara's, Bi-Rite, but Fentons knows how to do solid ice cream well. Toasted almond is delicious, but I always get the apple pie flavor when it's seasonally available (are apples ever NOT available?).

The ice cream all comes with little cookies, and even the tiniest size is a hefty wallop of dairy.

Food is decent as well, though come here for the sweet icy concoctions!</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Fenton delivers exactly what you came for! Large generous portions and amazing portions. It's a fun, family friendly atmosphere. It's diner style offering an array of great portions. I had the French Dip and it was exactly what I expected with no surprises. The foods great but the real star are the heaping desserts! I ordered the Cookie Connection. It's a warm chocolate chip cookie smothered with two large scoops of ice cream, cookie dough and cookies n' cream. Marshmallow sauce, chocolate fudge and crushed oreos! I could not even complete it but it was an amazing journey! Would definitely come again!<//review>

Cheeseburger was really good. We were seated fast but it was unbelievably noisy. I couldn't hear the people in my own party.  It was crowded too. The tables were too close together.  Our main waitress was nice but another was rude.<//Text>

It's an Easy Bay fixture with a lot of history although a lot of the old school character was lost during the fire years ago. But it's bigger brighter and louder now - about the only quiet time is early afternoon in the week when the kids are not around but at all other times expect to pick up a buzzer add wait. There is also a take out line for those wanting a quick fix. Bar seating is quicker too if you're okay with that. There is also a back room that can be rather chilly - you might actually believe you're in an  ice-cream factory.

Ice cream dessert portions are epically huge, i was once mocked for only ordering a junior sundae after dinner - but the thing was huge anyway. My advice - being a friend and your appetite!  Ice cream flavours include seasonal items, don't be shy about asking for a sample of you're unsure.< /text>

We went to Fenton's on a Saturday night, as it was highly recommended by locals. We opted to sit outside and were seated right away, even though it was busy. (I guess most people wanted to sit inside.) Our waitress was attentive and kind, giving us extra info about the menu and her recommendations. We ordered dinner (burgers) and then got the saddleback brownie. My hubby's burger order got messed up, but they remade it and gave us half off his entree, which was above-and-beyond. The dessert was excellent (amazing brownie!), but after burgers, my stomach probably would've been better off with a simple scoop of ice cream! :) We'll be back to try some other desserts.< /Text>

<Review>Fentons has never failed me (ice cream wise). It's just a ton of ice cream and once you see it, you'll be saying wowwwww.... Every ice cream has a great taste and the amount is just insane!

However, the food is not great... eat somewhere else but have dessert at Fentons!<//Review><UserId.>101857788099366310725< /UserId.><username>Enny Tran</username><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Come for the ice cream, stay for the curly fries!  No reservations, and maybe not worth the long weekend waits, but delicious diner fare all the same.  It's not on the menu, but I always get the chili cheese fries with curly fries instead of regular fries.  Sinful!  Better bring some friends with you to help conquer the banana split.</review>

My other half went into the restaurant to order a banana split for his birthday for us to share. Server at the counter treated him dismissively and like he was an irritation.  He came out with three scoops of ice cream in a vertical container with no banana. We liked the  ice cream, but there is no excuse to be treated poorly and not getting what you ordered.</review>

<text>Never eating Fenton’s again. Too sweet and didn’t live up to flavor- blueberry. Also $8.30 was way too much for the tiny, tiny scoop. If your visiting, just skip this spot.< /text>< Pictures>

I love the ice cream...no question it is the best. The service herr is slow when it is busy and they did mess up the order. Again, a busy restaurant can do That! The parking can be a challenge, but I still think it is worth it.< /Review>

Hate to say ice cream itself is overrated though it's a fun experience given the old fashioned feel. Fun time, just not the best ice cream or food.<//review>

The crab melt sandwiches and chocolate ice cream are my top recommendation.  Also, you will hear many children celebrating birthday there.  From there, I only see smile, laugh and satisfaction.  The only let down is the parking space.  This restaurant has its own parking lot, but always full.  Street parking is hard to find.< /Review><user>103739417928142577218</user>< Name>

<rating>2< /rating><text>Yes the food is good, but the service is slow and they often seemed quite plainly overwhelmed. Their refusal to take a reservation for large groups on certain days and unwillingness to seat a large group untill over half your group is there means that often large groups have to sit outside for long periods of time. Overall I'd say this is not a good place for a party but a decent place for lunch with a few friends.< /text>< pics>

Fenton's is an ice cream place that also serves American Diner food. The ice cream is one of the best in the bay. The food is mediocre at best. There's also very little vegetarian friendliness.  They have veggie burgers but they're made on a shared grill, etc. The place is usually packed but waits aren't long. Parking can be tricky.<//review>

Best place to get ice cream in the East Bay. Don't be intimidated by the crowds outside, many of the people are just in line for take out, I've never had to wait more than 15-20min for a seat inside.</Text>

Solid, upscale diner-style food, attentive service, comfortingly spacious decor. But the ice cream is why you come to Fenton's- huge variety of flavors, all of them outstanding, and the sundae creations are to die for.< /review>

A great place to visit for ice cream made on premise. Food is served here too. Maybe you'll meet some Pixar employees.</Review>

Who doesn't love Fenton's?! Parking is always hard, but it's worth it. Their selection of ice cream flavors is enormous, their portion sizes border on the ridiculous (a "single" scoop is actually a double), and their sundaes are infamously delicious. We take my stepson here every year for his birthday, and my husband and I go there to celebrate sometimes, too. The food is decent, but in the greasy diner food category. Everyone should visit Fenton's at least once for dessert. Or often :-)< /text>

A classic ice cream parlor that is still in high demand. The portions for their Sundaes are very large, so don't feel ashamed to share with someone. There is also a scoop counter, but we came for the real deal. Be forewarned - if its a hot day outside, you may be waiting for a while to get in the door.<//text>

Ice cream flavors are well done and scoops are huge! Wish I could give a lower rating because I hate children, but that's a me thing...expect to see/hear children.</text>

Deer jeebus, Lord in heathen, this place is pricey, but whereelsecan you get an ice cream dish that's 4000 calories? SWIM might go here baked and really enjoy it.<//text>

Fantastic ice cream. Their sundaes are extremely generous. They also make pretty good sandwiches, but stay away from the hamburgers. Desserts are their speciality, but it isn't great for a meal. Also, the dining rooms are noisy, so this isn't for a quiet meal either.< /Review>

<Text>It's a classic ice cream parlor and has a diner feel to it. The food is pretty unremarkable, but you know what you're getting and it's what you expect.</Text>< pics>

<review>What's not to like about an ice cream parlor? I mean, at the very worst, it's still ice cream!

Occasionally, there's a bit of a wait, but that's just because other people like their ice cream too -- don't hold that against them.

My favorite thing to get is the Banana Special, because I have an inner fat kid who's just trying to get out. Remember when ordering large though: mix up those flavors. You don't want to get stuck with a bunch of the same.

That being said, ice cream is a go!<//review>< Rate>

Really good ice cream. Most of the big sundaes are pretty huge, easily shared between 2-3 people, which helps explain the price.</review>

<text>This is by far, the best ice cream I have tasted. The friendly atmosphere and services received exceeded the customer satisfaction survey that one can be rated on.  Put a smile on your faces and head on over. I live in Pennsylvania and have visited Fenton's in Vacaville and Oakland over the past 5 years. It's a great place!< /text>< pics>

The venue is great. But, out server was not the best...he spoke  "at" us and not "to" us. Had to ask reapeately for items; i.e., straw, catsup, dessert menu..
Maybe he was just having a bad day!!!</text>

One of the best Creamerys in the Bay Area. Their burgers and sandwiches are delicious as well. It has an old school diner feel. There are a lot of tables available. Their parking lot is a bit small though. If you've seen the Pixar movie Up, this movie was in a scene towards the end of the movie.</Review>

I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. I like Fentons, the food is pretty good and who doesn't like ice cream. But I think the hype doesn't quite live up to the actual place.< /review>

Not bad, but certainly over rated. The ice cream is very high quality, but the food on the menu is average and severely over priced.</Text>

Took my son to this place. We order food, ate half of the food I order. Took my son to the restroom. Came back to the food being clear off the table. I told the person clearing the table off, that we was still eating. He says to me you should had said something!! I told him I shouldn't have to say anything about going to the restroom... Long story shorten no!!!</review>

Great burgers and sandwiches, and the best ice cream for dessert! Fenton's is an Oakland institution (did you catch it at the end of Pixar's Up?), famous for their ice cream made fresh on site. Be sure to put your name down with the hostess to get a seat. Fenton's is really accommodating and knows their customers well ("do i want fries or onion rings...?" Choose the half-and-half. Burgers and sandwiches are large and filling.

Their ice cream is worth the wait. Creamy and perfectly flavored, there's always something for everyone. The sundae us great to share with someone, but I personally like the black and tan. Their seasonal flavors are great too.

There is a small parking lot, but parking usually isn't too hard to find. Patio seating has heaters for the chilly nights, and there is a private back room for events.<//review>

The garbage on at the entry, on the counter and behind the guest check in was all filled up on a hot Sunday. It was really gross to see that sanitation is not a high priority at this establishment. Please please please empty the trash. Birds, children, trash and ice cream is not a combination I want to remember.<//review>

5 stars for the Black and Tan sundae or any of your favorite types of ice cream!  Don't order the food here as it's overpriced and not that good, especially the crab sandwich (definitely not worth the price)< /review>

<text>Minus two stars because I thought it was overly sweet, the guy helping us wasn't very friendly and it was on the expensive side.

I liked how they used metal spoons for samples but when we asked for a sample it seemed like it was a burden to the worker so I only got to try one. I regretted my choice right after I made it. I wish I got to try other flavors.

I tried my friend's cream caramel almond crunch and maple nut and they were soooo good.

The coffee to me was overly sweet. It had oreos and cookie dough. Regrets.</text>< Pics>

Classic neighborhood establishment, great ice cream, sundaes and comfort diner foods. Has the old school 50s diner feel down to the uniforms the servers wear.<//review>

This place is amazing ! First, the welcoming vibe you get from every single employee who speaks to you is fenomenal. As far as our Experience tonight, we walked in with our almost 2 year old, and they immediately sat us down. They already had a table ready with a high chair, it's like they were expecting us. It's Friday Night, they at so busy, and we did notice other people had been waiting , maybe they just had larger parties ... aside from getting in right away, the food was served pretty rapidly. The food was fresh, hot and very delicious. I can't wait go back and have more ice cream! We had to take our ice cream to go because our son was ray to go. I'm telling you, it's the best pistacho and cheese cake ice cream I've ever had in my entire life. So make your way up to the Famous Fenton's, you're missing out.</Review>< Rate>

<text>Our family goes to Fenton's a few times a year and we've never had bad food or ice cream, but we've sometimes had uneven service like long delays or mixed orders. Portions are unpredictable, with some sandwiches large and others small. Fenton's is always crowded and always noisy and the back room is best left to over-excited and over-sugared kids because you can't have a conversation back there. Parking in front is limited and requires luck. But if you're going to Fenton's you probably don't care about any of that. You're there for the delicious ice cream and photo-worthy giant sundaes. Fenton's is the Disneyland of ice cream and will have your kids wide-eyed in amazement and bouncing in their seats. They will talk about it for weeks and remember it forever. Like Disneyland, just be prepared to wait in line.</text>< response>

Amazing ice cream, and still made exactly the same way as when my grandparents first went there over 50 years ago.

If you're in the area, don't pass this up!<//review>

<text>I have been going to Fentons for my entire life snd have never had any issues until recently. The food was ok and overpriced, but I expected as much. The icecream was great, and always is. However, the service I received the last time I visited was extremely lacking. My waitress messed up on our order, was extremely forgetful, and made our table wait until I had to get up and find her to give us our check. Very dissapointed. I will not be going back anytime soon.</text>< pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>There are two kinds of great ice cream parlors in the Bay Area. The first is artisanal, small batch parlors with inventive flavors and an absurd attention to detail, like The Ice Cream Bar in Haight or Bi-Rite Creamery. Fenton's is the other kind: their focus is on rich, classic flavors done right and stacked high, served in a busy but friendly atmosphere. The closest thing to it would be Leatherby's in Sacramento. There can be a decent wait during peak hours, and I haven't tried anything but their ice cream, but so far I wouldn't change a thing.< /text>< user>

<Date>1499418100543< /Date><rating>4<//rating><text>Right when I arrived to Fenton's, I already knew what was in store for me. The parking spot literally only had like five spaces and since there is hundreds of people inside. I decided not to wait unless I was trying to set a Guinness record of man that waited the longest for a parking spot. We had to drive and park one block away since there was many signs that warn we will tow you (your car) while you are enjoying Fenton's.

I wasn't too worried as it was a nice day for a walk. When we got to Fenton's, there were ten to fifteen people waiting. That day i got to know random people on a personal level accidentally since it was so crowded. There was only two of us so we got the stools right in front of the cooks ( I'm watching you cooks....).

The waitress came up and hurried us if we are ready yet. As it was our first time and we didn't even crack the menu we told her come back in a few mins.

We ended up ordering the jalapeno poppers tuna sandwich and cranberry turkey sandwich.
Jalapeno poppers were the BOMB! It was the right kind of crispy and soft in the inside.
The tuna sandwich was decent, nothing new or extraordinary here.
The cranberry turkey was great because the ingredients matched up perfectly and the savory cranberry oozing out the sandwich.
The superstar for this part was the curly fries. I don't recall that I have tasted a better curly fries than here! Crispy and soft as you bite into it making it hard to resist popping more in your mouth.

Now for my next act i would like to present the desert part!

We ordered the cookie crunch(not sure if real name) and the saddle back brownie sundaes. Sad to say is that we didn't know how big it really was.

The cookie crunch had two colossal scoops of ice cream. That rich cookie dough blended it with melting ice cream allied with cookies on the bottom! Every gushing flavor just twisting my mouth because of how bloody good it is! And that was only the first bite!

The saddle back brownie is a terrific name because that brownie is really the size of a saddle! Humungous! i'm talking about a entity that cannot be fully kept by the bowl! It came with two or three scoops of ice cream.The cold delicate ice cream paired with the hot brownie just told my taste buds into groupies awaiting its next arrival! As she just threw in the white surrender flag, I also waved my flag.

We ended taking more than half home. We went to town not too long after and just completely obliterated it.

If you will be going in there. Soldier give it a empty stomach because you will be going to war on those sundaes and I wish nothing but victory for you.</text>< pics>

Overpriced for quality no better than a regular ice cream shop, and I was disappointed that I couldn't order a sundae because they're big enough for five people to share. No way I'm spending $12 on ice cream.<//Review>

Wait time wasnt as bad as promised we were told 45minutes but were seated in 15 minutes. Atmosphere was that of a diner but elegant, menu options where variable but i was disappointed at the quality and price of the burgers iv definately had much better quality at a better price and not to mention frys are not a part of the dish just added to the dissapointment service was good and timely. I would probably only return for the ice cream since that was the only thing i didnt try. food here is disapointing to say the least definately the worse burger at the worse price iv ever had.</text>

Great food all around, from the apps to sandwiches, burgers, etc.
Oh, did I mention the ice creams are off the hook?<//Text>

Excellent place and ice cream! However, parking is tough and it does get pricey.< /text>

I'd heard about this place for a while but never checked it out till recently.  Wow what a surprise for a place that is so popular.  I guess you should stick with either the icecream or the burgers.  I can't believe how lousy our lunch was.  Sent back the fish and chips because the inside of the fish was frozen.  Then got the french dip which was soooo mediocre.  Eating it actually made feel kind of sick.  French dip is a hard one to screw up.  It appeared to be pre-sliced roast beef out of some package.  Understandable but low quality.  The bread was weirdly doughy and soft for a dutch crunch roll.  My wife's sandwich wasn't any better.  There were plenty of servers but they never filled our tiny dixie cup size water glass unless we asked them.  Also, had to ask for salt and pepper shakers to try and pull some flavor from my sandwich.  The servers all were young with this deer in the headlights kind of look.  I know they're not a deli and are know for their icecream and history but these $14 sandwiches  were really crappy.  I felt like I ate at McDonalds or something.  Not going back.</text>

Traditional and a bit cheesy, the ice cream isn't as dense as it should be for the price. Go for the experience rather than the taste.</Text>

<text>For what you get, which is A LOT, dessert at this place is worth every penny.

All I wanted was a root beer float with a mini scoop of rainbow sherbet and it was TOO MUCH (for me) hahaha I had to tag team it with my brother!

Our server was great.. friendly, funny and informative. On my next visit, I promise not to be so full already!</text><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

(Translated by Google) It was great to have meals and desserts in one place. However, there were a lot of people, so I was very noisy.
