The staff is super helpful, one of the dryers wasn't quite working and the lady working there at the time took care of it. Super clean surfaces and machines, they're always cleaning them and wiping them down. Free wifi to keep the kiddos entertained, they can plug in they're devices and charge them as well. A bending machine so they can snack while you wash. Or you can just drop off your dirty laundry and they'll do the work for ya!<//review>

Nicest coin laundry place I have ever visited! Clean, well kept, a great variety of detergents/dryer sheets/drinks/snacks/etc.. available in the vending machine. Coin machine on site. They also have an app so you can pay via your phone w QR codes on the machines- how high tech and cool is that! There was a super nice and helpful lady there to wash/dry/fold your laundry for you if you want to pay for that and just come pick it up later. Would definitely come here again!<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I came here based on the reviews. I like that you could use an app to start your washer and dryer and Pay.
Things to keep in mind:
1.  download the app Huebsch
2. To use the app it requires you to add $10 to your “account”

$2.50 to wash in residential size washer. They do have detergent available for purchase and several options of detergent to choose from.
Open 24 hours for the self serve laundry. Very clean and well lit inside.
Love that the app can send you an alert 3 mins before your load completes.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

A little pricey, but so very good. Could've easily shared a plate with my husband. I had plenty left over and couldn't finish. I also had a biscuit with the jam...it was delish. My husband had the burrito special with al pastor, and HE was full, and it takes a lot for him to be full.< /Text>

This place is great, got the corned beef hash and biscuits and gravy. The biscuit itself was delicious, nice and buttery, lots of layers. We’ll be coming back. Service was super friendly too!<//Review>

The biscuit with jam was my favorite part of the meal. The service was good as well. Not crazy about the location, very crammed. Gratuity is included but we were not informed prior to ordering. I'm sure this is a good breakfast option for those who live nearby, but I won't be going out of my to return.< /Text>

This place is awesome. The staff is super nice and helpful. They don't accept tips and it's a teamwork approach where you will see several faces through your meal. It's a small place with a great look and feel. And the food... wow the food. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Just go!!< /Text>

Very good food, in a weird location but once you find it it's easy to get to. The small menu has basic breakfast items but they are all very good.</review>

Tried this cozy little place for the first time, an Indian restaurant doubling as breakfast place on specific times, so called popup restaurant. Genius idea to share a location. The hash eggs were good. Would definitely return.<//text>

A small, sweet place ..5 tables indoors and some few more on a patio. Tasteful,modern decor & limited menu. Food is fresh, healthy, creative  and slow to arrive. Not cheap but good portions. Would return.<//Review>

<Review>Interesting little breakfast option. Apparently it's an Indian restaurant in the evening and breakfast shop in the morning. The egg sandwich, French toast and chilaquiles were great! If you're looking for quick and cheap, this might not be the place... but if you just want to relax and enjoy a nice breakfast in a unique location, this is a perfect option.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80deaa36cec6fd37:0xe6fbff937d1ce2a7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
There were four in my party and we came for breakfast May 21. The food was good but for the price, not worth the cost. Two of us ordered biscuits but had to pay an additional $1.00 for their house made jam. For a $2.50 biscuit, it seems the jam should come with??? They also were out of the house made bloody Mary mix. Breakfast Repuplic is a better bet. Big portions and good strong coffee that isn't going to cost $3.50 a cup.<//Review>

<Text>Only giving 2 stars because the service and atmosphere are decent. The food and coffee were so gross and overpriced. The coffee didn't smell or taste like coffee, it was basically hot water. I ordered the chilequiles and they were the worst I've ever had. The bottom of the plate was covered in a watery substance, making everything soggy and messy. So unappetizing. My boyfriend got the sweet potato hash and all the potatoes and veggies were undercooked. Confused why this place has good reviews! I won't be back after wasting $50 on a bad breakfast.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Kerry Hayden doesn't know what she is talking about in her review.  The coffee is some of the best I have had at breakfast.  My breakfast was approximately $15.....not $50!!  Very good breakfast and the wait wasn't all that long.  Give it a try!<//Text>

<UserId.>108739784339562516156< /UserId.><text>Between three and four stars. Overall, the food was ok, but the way the restaurant is set up is weird -- small enough so that we could hear the staff's personal conversations. The kimchi fried rice was great, but overpriced at $14. The avocado toast was $10 for a single piece of seemingly store-bought bread, half an avocado, eggs and a pinch of greens. However, the service was pretty good and I like the idea of sharing a restaurant between day and night for full utilization and the notion of a built-in service charge instead of tipping.</text><Rating>3< /Rating><Response>None< /Response><name>Jeff Payne<//name>< gmapID>

I’ve come here several times and had a lovely experience each time.
Get a biscuit. Get the jam.
They need to serve a biscuit appetizer and/or dozen take out so I can get chubby off these things. Yessai!!</text>

Eggs are eh. Only one piece if French toast for 12$. Honestly very over priced. If we are gonna pay that much at least give us a little more food. Coffee was too strong.</Text>

A little pop-up restaurant operating only on weekend mornings in the premises of Sundara would be expected to do a great breakfast, and Jake's does. The word already it out - place gets crowded fairly quickly - but if you get there in time to get a table, whatever else you try (daily special always a good choice), try the homemade biscuits - light and fluffy and fresh - and the gravy with some kind of special herb that makes it the best ever.</review>

The breakfast burrito I had was good, but it was lacking flavor. They had IPA on tap at 9am, so that was nice.</Review>

Was in San Diego for business and decided to try this place before heading to the airport. Excellent choice on my part. Gotta try the kimchee dish. WOWZA. Must try for breakfast when in SD. Fantastic.< /review>

<Text>Had a wonderful experience here. We called about 30 minutes ahead of time and only waited about 10 minutes for a table. I had the special, Denver Omelet sliders....yes...they were amazing. The coffee was got and fresh, loved the wide mugs. Everyone at Jake and Eggs is working hard to make sure customers are taken care of. Don't take my word for it - go!
Protip: try the off menu brownbutter muffin - it's fantastic!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>I had the machado burrito which I thought was bland and overpriced although everything on the menu is overpriced. I gave this place a 3 star because everyone else enjoyed their meals. Service was fine. Overall, not a place I would recommend.< /Text><username>Brett LaCues<//username><user_id>111486293661818877321</user_id>< Pictures>

This Subway is not good! The girl making the sandwiches had no creative ability. She loaded the sandwich with all the fixings in the center and when she cut the bread she ripped the bread in multiple places on the 12" sandwich. Her attitude was so poor. She had this look on her face like she was band to the deepest, darkest place in hell....called Subway! If you dont like the place you're working at then hey....pretend to because frankly no body cares. We are coming to the establishment for food or whatever, not for your bad teenage attitude. The place was nasty too. Cutting board dirty and veggies and tuna all over. The place was not busy at all. There were 2 people working there and not one of them was concerned with the cleanliness of the place. I will not be going back.< /text>

It's 3:30 pm. They only had 2 options of Bread. 2 options of cookies and it was said that it would take 2 hours to bake bread. Not very happy, but very hungry.</review>

Moved close to here a couple months ago and literally every single time I have been here the bread has been stale, sometime to the point that it cuts the roof of your mouth.  I mentioned it 4 or 5 times but they dont care obviously.

Do yourself a favor and go to a different location  like I am now, even though its much further. .</review>< pictures>

I live down the street from this subway, naturally when I'm hungry this is a first choice for me. There have been several times that I have been dissatisfied with the way this place has been run and I've thought about leaving this review before. I wouldn't do this sort of thing normally, but today pushed me over the edge.

I waited for a total of 30 minutes today behind one customer. This customer ordered more than 8 sandwiches and there was only one person on staff at the time. The other came back from lunch early to help with the amount of backup that had been occurring. Every time I come here and its like this I don't get angry at the people working behind the counter because they are doing the best they can, and they are working fast to get what needs to be done done.

I wholeheartedly believe that there is a huge management problem and a huge disconnect with the people that run this place with how the operations actually work. I'm only writing this review because I'm hoping that someone in management at this restaurant might actually change the way things are working and think about the experience they are creating for their employees, which then extends to your customer. I hope you fix this, for now I'll travel the extra mile to the next subway on Sante Fe.<//Text>

Clean store front with a great new addition of a agua frescas dispenser. Was served by a fellow from Michigan, very kind and good conversation. For being from Michigan, he rolled my burrito/wrap like an absolute pro.</Review>

Horrible horrible service!  Empty store, one girl working, she could not have been less pleasant from the moment I walked in the door.  Skip this Subway.  The people in these stores are usually terrific.  Very disappointed in this store.<//Text>

The worst losers work here. Where they really can even count your change correctly. Or they have NO bread, but they have the gaul to promote new items.< /Text>

<Review>Usually pretty good, but last few visits they have been running out of EVERYTHING! Live by Vista High School Subway but would always drive to this one. Not anymore. Sad to say but won't be going to either anymore both are terrible.< /Review>< Rating>

The food and the feel of this place made me feel like I escaped work for a second.  I ordered biscuits and gravy, with a hot chocolate.  My order was up in less than 10 minutes.  I’d go back if it was the only place near me or when I have a taste for biscuits and gravy.  Delicious!

Went back again for lunch on 3/26/2018.
The potatoes were phenomenal! Very quick service again.< /text>

Highly recommend love this place. The exterior is clean and well kept, but easy to miss (No Open Sign in the huge window that faces Capital mall). Placed just about midway between the tower bridge and the Capital building. Great food served hot with good service. Nice menu selection to fill you up or just tie you over. Coffee is tasty, but beer, wine and soda can also be had.

Food was good, expensive as was coffee. Could not taste any lavender on my lemonade. Everything's in Togo boxes, though you can eat there.<//Text>

Very nice addition to Old Soul. Convenient for quick meeting over coffee. Outdoor seating area a big plus. Coffee is always great. As is the food. Would be a 5-star except parking isn't the most convenient if you are going just to Old Soul. Perfect location for those in neighboring high rises.</text>

Great location if walking, friendly service. Food menu has good variety. Quiche specials change often and are consistently excellent. Coffees are delicious, espresso is toward the chocolate/fudgy end of the spectrum - not on the acrid/tobacco end. Very enjoyable.</text>

<review>I don't generally write reviews, but I had to share my experience at Old Soul on Capitol Mall from this morning. I (thought?) ordered a veggie breakfast sandwich and coffee and I was brought a regular veggie sandwich and salad. I was disappointed, but if I was unclear, well that's my own fault. So I was going to eat half of the sandwich and save the rest for lunch. But the nice person (manager, maybe?) who saw my acute disappointment made me a veggie breakfast sandwich and gave it to me along with a box to take the other sandwich. I was so touched by this gesture, especially since it was probably my fault to begin with. Old Soul has earned my unswerving loyalty forever. Thank you to the staff there for being so nice and always looking out for the clientele! Oh yeah, and their food and coffee are really great also :-)<//review><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_id>

Stopped by here the other day on my way to work and I'm not sure that it was what I expected. I've been to the other Old Soul's which were great but this one I'm not sure of. The coffee seemed a little too original and the barista that took my order wasn't too kind. Other's might have better experience's, but mine wasn't too great.<//review>

< Review>
Great coffe and food spot. Great location on Capitol mall with beautiful water features outside where there is outdoor seating as well as inside with comfortable longs seating. I did not try any food on my visit except for pastries and dessert which were delicious especially after they warmed them for me. Lots of drink options, I had a vanilla latte which was perfect with a single shot of espresso. Loved the mugs they came in you can have the option of having it in a takeaway cup also.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>My favorite weekend coffee spot! Same great coffee and food as the other Old Soul locations. On the weekends its pretty much empty and there's tons of parking available on the side street. I haven't been here on a weekday when I would assume it's way busier due to the proximity to the Capitol and downtown office buildings. Love their mochas, tea selections and PB cookies, but everything is good. There is only one barista running register and making drinks, but it's never been crowded when I go, so service is still relatively quick.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Went there this morning around 9:30am.  Place was closed, even though the sign at door and website says they open at 7:00am. A staff person or owner was unlocking the door, when I asked if they were opening he was rude and dismissive.<//text>

We had the most wonderful coffee here, served beautifully and artfully, especially tasty! The outside seating next to the fountain was nice but there is plenty of seating indoors!<//review>

Cool spot on Capitol Mall. Came in on Sunday for coffee. Coffee is good; place is absent of the homeless crowd and drama that is rampant in the Downtown area.<//Text>

<text>My girlfriend and I went for brunch on sunday. The quality of the food was unbelievably horrible.  She ordered the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was burned hard and black. I ordered the omelet.  The potatoes were so oversalted they were inedible.  The cashier was nice and exchanged them. But it was unbelievable the kitchen sent such obviously bad food to the customers. ..we will never eat there

Coffee is horrible, not enough variety such as white mochas and other flavors, food portions are very small and everything is over priced for what you get.< /Text>

< Review>
Today wasn't good at first no chassis once I got one the guy that dropped it never said the back twistlock was gone so I got back in line and waited again then a guy came all the way over from the shop and asked if I needed a pool chassis or evergreen I said pool he said I just finished one with the bit and paperwork I had just prayed for a good chassis not more then 5min before that but once I got hooked up an went to my spot the crain guy climb down and went to lunch lol I guess you can't win em all lol I ended up getting to Phoenix at 9 tonight but you know it's OK</Review>

Very good for the price - which is pretty much the lowest you’ll find. Be careful coming at busy times (Saturday morning, Friday afternoon) as the wait can be horrendous. As long as you can plan around this, this place is fine.<//Text>

The gentleman that does the haircuts is pleasant and goes by a pictured list of haircuts that he cuts. All cuts are $9.00 and he at 1 time worked Super cuts. There was another person, Steve that I knew who retired and was very good. And the guy that runs the place is very good. I'm a repeat customer.</Text>

We were looking for a good barber shop for long! This is the best! Not for the price, it's just the best in the area...price is cheaper than anywhere else! I pay 10 for kids, and 12 for myself.<//text>

An average, quite inexpensive barber. Weekdays guys haircut is 8$ at the time of this comment. Their cut is good if you want a simple clean cut, it works for me but do not expect anything special here. The barber himself is not much friendly, he never speaks to me really. The place is average clean. Note: do come here if you want to see his funny routine with the stall.<//text>

So if there's one person ahead of you it might be a 30 minute wait! The quality of haircut reflected the attention to detail and I was very satisfied with my haircut.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Fast and high-quality cuts, and walk-ins served with little to no wait. If you're thinking of getting a cut after a day of work it won't be a mistake to add this to your plans.< /Review>

My new go-to place. Love the way they style my hair, they do a great job with the fade, better than other places. They trim my beard for nothing extra, where super cuts will charge like $10 more. With such a low price and great style, I'm going to come here every 2-3 weeks now.</Review>

For $11 it is a decent place to get a normal haircut.

Edit : It used to be a good place, but not anymore.!<//review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>The sign clearly states that kids haircuts are $10 but when it came time to pay, the woman charged me $15 because "girls haircuts are more than boys". If you want to charge different prices you need to state that up front and not falsely advertise to customers. Do not go here unless you want to fall victim to dishonest business practices.<//Text><gmap_id>0x808fb65d1cd72773:0x47637b32fe5fa633<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

< review>
The stylist didn't seem super familiar with using clippers -- she kept bonking my face with them. And she removed my beard without asking. And then made some excuses about it. I was like "please trim my beard to the same length as my hair", and then she got out the clippers and started removing my beard. I couldn't really stop her once she had started, since then I'd just have a weird missing beard piece. At first she claimed that that's what I had asked for, that it really *was* the same length... but then she offered that "it'll grow back in a day".

... strong work, exactcuts, strong work :-P< /review>

Bad experience! We drive from far, stop to put gas and use restroom, and we were unable to use it even as client. Is Pandemic stuff he wants me to go Denny’s instead! What a bad service, I totally understand the situation but gas station without restroom? 🤬</Text>

Great prices on gasoline and friendly service.  I gave them only 4 stars because their gas pumps are frequently unable to process credit cards or produce receipts without going into the store.<//text>

It's an ARCO gas station in a fairly depressed part of town. Usually has cheaper gas than other stations in the area. The bathrooms are kind of dirty. Otherwise, there's the usual AMPM market, and easy access from the freeway as well as return.</review>

I know for a fact that donuts are 2 for $1. And I'm in love with them. I send my hubby over walking, to get me 2 glazed donuts. The guy charged him .89 a piece and since I only handed him a dollar, he had to wall back up the stairs and so forth..really? Rip someone else off. I'll find another place to get my don't fix thank you. My husband also informed me that customers no longer get free air. They told him it was broken...unless he pays.    What?  Lost 2 customers</text>

Delicious food. Always very fresh no matter what time of day you were there. My friends of been coming here for years and now they bring me here. What a great hidden gem. Never many people there I wish more people knew about it to keep them in business. Great price for all you can eat.<//Text>

< Review>
We had a work get together with a large group on a Friday night and there were no issues with services. Smooth as silk.
The meats are tender and the spices are fantastic! My favorite meat is the spicy pork!! (Warning: It has a kick if you aren't used to spicy foods!)
The dipping sauces have great flavor as do the "non-spicy" meats.
The experience of cooking your food at your table is great! If you have questions on how to do it, the staff is wonderful about showing you. Just ask! It's a family owned business so their heart and soul are in everything.
Be sure to enter off of Lancaster Blvd., otherwise it's tricky to find from inside the Marketplace.< /Review>

The little Korean lady always tickled my son everytime she walked by. The meat and food was fresh and delicious and seasoned perfectly.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

First time here. Nice selection for the basic dinner. Excellently spiced meats. Very fun for a group cooking your own grub. I think next time I'll need to go with an expert to assist in all the other menu selections.</text>

Confusing, super complicated menu and pricing structure. However, meat appears fresh, service ok. Yet, side dishes (essential part of any Korean meal) need Improvement in freshness, quality and taste.< /Text>

This place is nothing more than a all you can eat buffet. Therefore, there is nothing really special to say about it.< /Review>

Not impressed with the food. We decided to try the Louisiana style cooking side of the business and after having THE BOILING  CRAB our expectations where high. Unfortunately, it did not meet up to those standards and since then we now have our own shrimp boil recipe at home. Thank you for the service but will not return.</review>

This place is great. It's run by a Korean couple and they know their stuff. You cook your food on a grill in your table, which just adds to the meal. The buffet options are all very good, and they even have hotdogs for the picky eaters. The banchan is also excellent. I personally love the broccoli - I could eat a while plate of that!  If you are looking for some authentic Korean BBQ, then this is the place to go.</Text>

Just moved to the big AV...was so excited when we found out AV had a Korean BBQ style joint....WAS SO SAD...poor service, poor quality food and SAD selection.  Nothing at all like the Korean BBQ joints in Los Angeles.  Over priced, over hyped, and so amazed to hear how other reviews raved about this place.  NEVER COMING BACK!  AV deserves BETTER!!!!<//Review>

Was not what me and my family expected at all from previous other experiences. Food was very over priced and no variety to choose from the meats. Service was not great and the food was tasteless. Ruined my mother's birthday and we were hoping the food would be brought to us like previous Korean BBQ. I dont know what the hell those other reviews are talking about. They obviously do not know what a real Korean BBQ is all about.<//Text>

In short - good food, place looks great; good place to take a date.

My wife and I had dinner here to celebrate her promotion at work and had a great time.  First, just walking in - the lobby looks amazing.  The whole place has fairly high ceilings which gives it an open feel.  It also lets the noises dissipate quicker, so even though there were other people dining in the restaurant, we couldn't hear them as loudly as we would if the ceilings had been lower. We liked how clean the place was and the decor. We got the "All You Can Eat"  "Course #1".  With drinks our total was around 47 dollars for the two of us.  They have New Castle, Pacifico, Blue Moon and Coors on tap.  Like most Korean BBQ places they bring out plates of meat for you to cook on the grill in the center of the table.  Our waiter (like every staff member we ran into) was very polite, kind and attentive.

We enjoyed the "rib eye" which was the fairly typical thinly cut beef with seasonings that you find at Korean BBQ places and also  the spicy pork the most.  We also tried the short ribs, brisket, steak, pork belly and teriyaki chicken all of which were terrific, but were a bit more plain compared to the two dishes we enjoyed the most.

They also offer 6 sides with the meal.  We got the salad, rice, broccoli, macaroni salad, bean sprouts and kimchi.  The salad was mostly just different types of lettuce with a sweet sesame-type dressing.  It was fresh and fine for a starter.  The rice was appropriately sticky, which is preferable when eating with chopsticks.  My wife liked the kimchi, though it was a bit more spicy then she expected.

We had a great night, and will definitely be back soon!< /review>

I order your Carmel Iced Latte 3-4 times a week, every week because its FANTASTIC.  I only know how to order them in your 32oz cup; any other size just seems wrong.  Just wanted to share my gratitude and say thanks to your crew!<//Text>

<text>Great experience! Friendly staff! Quick service! Tasty coffee! Beats just about every coffee house! I'll pass several coffee shops and travel a distance to find a coffee bean! The girls working were very helpful and personable! Everyone complaining about the restrooms should be ashamed! Coffee Bean has no control over covid OR the stipulations and mandates introduced and enforced by the government! Their quality of product and service is much higher than most and cannot be downplayed by an incomparable, uncontrollable set of circumstances!<//text><rate>5< /rate><user_id>102015242194053443501< /user_id><GmapID>0x80dcdf88c477368f:0x50cf244492f1cf99</GmapID><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8R_CyPc1CoDKIpRch9V_Aa1AcRcVFOxdljapn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Name>Star Entertainment<//Name>< Response>

I’d give you zero stars if I can Micheal a plus for effort I guess wait what effort smh.</Text>< username>

The only downside is the no-bathroom thing. I’m not sure where the closest one is to this location, but if I knew, I would go back.</text>< rating>

Staff is just rude and it's no longer worth giving them my business. I'll find another coffee bean or a Starbucks. I've been a consistent customer for 4 months and can't even have a drink made how I want or a pastry toasted without attitude. I hope this comes under new management or ownership.</Text>

<Review>This store needs customers service training. Went in today to purchase a coffee and muffin, wanted to use the restroom first. Needless to say I didn't buy anything because the young lady would not give me the restroom code. She was so rude, with her response. Saying you have to buy something first. My co workers stopped going there awhile ago for the say reason. I never knew using a restroom was that big of a deal. This is definitely my last time coming her, and I will advise everyone I know to go to Starbucks. Like Starbucks you guys need sensitivity training before you end of in the news treating people this way.<//Review><UserId.>108998893058148641927</UserId.>< gmap_id>

Wouldn't let me use the restroom although I made a purchase I was going to make anyways not to mention I'm 9 months pregnant with a young child. I love coffee bean but there is more than a few  reasons why Starbucks is a lot more convenient.</Review>

I bought breakfast and was sitting down responding to business emails and phone calls and every time i looked down at my phone to read an email (i didnt have my glasses so i was having to read at an amgle and a bit close to my face) she would knock on the table and yell at me to wake up even though i was clearly awake. She did this multiple times even when i was om the phone.
Shes racist and unprofessional and i will be speaking to corporate about this. I spent my money here to enjoy breakfast but it was ruined because some crazy woman was bothering me any chance she got. Ive seen her do this to black people and younger people that look homeless...even if they buy coffee or food.
She treats customers very poorly and needs to be fired asap as im sure the store is losing customers because of her bad attitude and blantant racisim.</review>< Pics>

They make the best mocha frappacino. Add 2 shots or three. And only 3/4 of chocolate. Ask for extra ice blended w/whipped cream.  A lot better than Starbucks. And it stays colder for a long time!!!   Delicious and gets you going in the right direction.    Really.  You have to try it.  Ask for thick.  Just don't get it later in the day.  You will be up all nite!!!<//review>

This is the post gym hang out for 24. The service is slow but it gets done. Arrive early or late if you need to plug in while using wifi.

Mothers love to hot the outlet equipped seating for nothing more than ogling their nonsense spewing offspring.

Please contact me so I can be there if you set one of them straight.< /review>

This review is based on the customer service. As a disabled person, I have trouble using the restroom sometimes and after only 5 minutes the employees started banging on the door telling me to hurry up. Very unprofessional and rude.< /Text>

I ordered a pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives. Delicious but skimpy! The mushrooms were the best! Second, were the olives. And the crust was third. And in last place were the skimpy pepperoni (microscopic slices)< /review>

Every time I order online my name never seems to come up, the name that shows up is unknown customer. This is very frustrating when I have enter my profile several times and it never seems to work. This is the reason for my rating.</Review>

The Staff Wasn't very Professional. When I first Walked In. It Was Almost As If The Staff Wanted To Focus On The Orders That Were Already Called In. And Once I Was Helped. They Didn't Have The Pizza I Wanted. And They Didnt Even Try To Accommodate me.</text>

I called to order large pepperoni pizza and it was $15, the person who answered the phone was rude. When I told him it was too expensive and if they have any special he said it’s cheaper if I order it online. So why do they need employees if they are asking their customers to order online & they can’t apply the online special?</Text>

If i could i would give it 0 stars cause i waited for my pizza 25min and they gave my pizza to another customer and when i was waiting for my refund the custer came in with the pizza and they tried to say they had put it in another bag when it wasn't true. I think thats very unprofessional for the manager on charge and the rest of the employees i dont recommened you to come to this pizza hut</review>

I was saying my street name loud and clear and he  just said "What?" like a drop out.

<text>Horrible. Absolutely the worst Pizza Hut ever. They don't honor any specials. They are rude. Always late and will not give you your pizza unless they see your credit card. They dont even take an imprint of the credit car so why even bother. I had to deal with a snarky rude driver who didnt even come to my front door and instead made me walk out of my gated community and find him. Naturally I wasnt happy. Im paying 3.50 for you to deliver it to my door. Even though i showed him my ID and clearly established I was the one who ordered and paid for it. He simply refused to give me my order. Very unreasonable and rude.

I am aware the Pizza hut has a policy of always requiring the customer to present thier card, however I also know that its only for verification purposes and a drivers license should have more than sufficed.

This is only the beginning. The second time I ordered I placed a phone order for carryout. When I got there they had gotten my order completely wrong. Not even close. They refused to make it right. Then the lady who took my order just rolled her eyes and made a racist comment in Spanish. I was outraged and demanded a refund. She refused and said no refunds. I just couldnt believe how a place like this was still in business. Now to add the cherry on top of the BS Sundae that is this pizza hut. When she finally agreed, she swiped my card and double charged me.

I cut my losses and I hope that if you have read this far you will consider boycotting this location. I hope they close down or hire new staff.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2ca77dd39d603:0xe0af168874aa006b< /gmap_id><rating>1</rating></record></dataset><record>

<username>linda lafrance< /username><Text>We have been going there for 24 years. Best burgers 🍔 we have ever had.  Our fast food is Burger Junction. We like their fries, hot dogs, and many other options. The owners are the best. The area may be a little sketchy but homeless people don't threaten you. Their just needy. I've never been bothered by anyone.</Text>< date>

One of the greatest burger places around. Might not be in the nicest area but no one has nothing on their burgers. The chicken sandwich is one of the best, that chicken breast is always so juicy. I have been going their since I was small and now I take my kids and they love it.< /Text>

Let me just tell ya, Me and my uncle went here for about 2-3 years or so. Good ol’ times, but anyways this place was the best! I hate to say that we had to stop going because my uncle died from a heart attack. We only stopped by for a quick meal before my piano lessons. The Jr. Burgers are so good I can’t explain it! Service quality was a 10/10, staff are friendly. Don’t read the bad ones. But one problem was the cleanliness. Still good place to eat!</Review>< resp>

You’d be missing out if you just drive past and didn’t even stop.  These burgers will change your life.  There are some places that really bring out that inner love for everything and everything around you , once you’ve taken your first bite, you just melt into the flavor and a wave of happiness comes over you.  You smile and nothing else matters. Worth it</Review>

The service is excellent. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears the owner is the Chef? The food is old school. I am glad this spot is available. Sick and tired of ordinary fast food. This spot is perfect. I hope they set up tables outside so we may enjoy the location. Either way, make a stop here weather you're feeling for a healthy or hearty meal.</text>

I celebrated my nomination earlier this evening in this fine place. I am glad to say that we had a astonishing evening and the venue was surely the reason for the outstanding meeting. The waiters  cooperated in a graceful style, the meals were yummy and my friends were very  pleased. We shall definitely return for more celebrations. Thank you very much.<//review>

This review doesn't reflect the food . The food was great ,old school burgers and fries . The meat was fresh not frozen and was seasoned well and very juicy and flavorful . The issues were the homeless population hanging right outside the establishment , panhandling and harrasing every customer. The other issue is the cleanliness of the business . The windows and window sills we're in need of  a cleaning ,the table was sticky with  a residue ,and the ceiling tiles needed to be replaced . Just based on the food would be a solid 3 ... But the other issues brings it down to 2 star rating .</Text>

Delicious and juicy burgers, lots of juicy marinated chicken on the chicken salad, and friendly service from owners Ben and Sal and all the wonderful hard working young people they employ. Have been enjoying their food for the past 25 years!!</Review>

On of the best burgers! The restaurant is a rundown mall but there is a steady stream of customers seeking out a great meal. The owner works in the kitchen,  which says a lot about his pride of ownership.< /Text>

Was cooked pretty good. Burger was good but not great. Quite greasy. Flavor was descent. Like I said good not great. I'm kinda wondering what scale they used because the patty was pretty thin for a 1/2 lb patty. It was wide but not that wide. I've been measuring and cooking food for 40 years. It might have been and that would explain the grease. 70/30 could shrink like that. Anyway I had the fries (Sides are a la cart)  They were cooked to a perfect crispness on the outside and the inside was perfectly cooked. Only problem is no flavor. I mean none. Just potatoes with a little salt. Tasteless. I think they meant that after reading the receipt. It said plain fries. Got em. I would try the curly or something else personally. Burger was $7.99, fries were $2.94. A bit too much for the two items. I probably won't be back but who knows. For the price I would rather go to five guys or someplace else.
Finally, I would hope they would actually have someone who knows how to clean a bathroom do it!  Two words. Pumice stone. Disgusting guys. Went in to wash my hands and wow. Grey sink from lack of proper cleaning. Toilet rings. Seriously?  The interior of the restaurant is dated and in need of TLC.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Good for the price. Very affordable and the buns are high quality. I had way too much mustard on my chicken burger, but otherwise it was good. Cannot accommodate more than four people to a table.<//Review>

<Review>They got those buns you drool for on A burger.
Its one of those places that hide in the plaza but once you find them you won't forget about them.

My family and I have had numerous burgers and other items from here and all been good over the last decade we have been coming.

But the flame grilled burgers are so good, and you can watch the flames as they cook through the window.

They have been open for decades now and have a lot of the memorabilia all over the walls. And I believe the owner still flips them burgers here.

They have a Philly cheesesteak, Turkey,  and chicken sandwiches,  hotdog I think too.
Curly fries. Regular fries and some appetizers too. Don't forget about the milkshakes.<//Review>< Pics>

I liked the taste of the burgers simple but not bland. It's a cozy little hole in the wall so I liked the fact that there wasn't many people for the lunch rush. They serve bottled beer as well so you can even drink if you wanted one with your burger. I got the avacado burger and added bacon it was a little pricey because you have to pay for fries and soda separate but the serving size was worth it, and the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. It's a nice place to go eat if you want a peaceful lunch and going for a nice quiet lunch date without all the distractions of a more popular spot. I'd go again if I'm ever in the area.<//review>

This place is great! Love their food. Mushroom burger or double is so good. Big juicy and delicious! Meals don't come with fries, have to order separate. Indoor seating. Short wait time.<//Text>

I called to order a jr cheeseburger with mushrooms, bacon, avocado and grilled onions minus pickles. I ordered this last week the same way and was told today by the employee that in order to get a jr cheeseburger that way i must get a fry and drink. I then said well i don't want the other stuff its a waste of money i only want the burger. The man who said he has worked there for 30 years says give her the bacon free and thats it we dont make that. I don't understand how or why can't I just order a jr cheeseburger by itself from a burger place. this place deserves 0000 stars for customer service and wack food service but the food is good.</Text>

<text>A few days ago I was at the Rite Aid next to Burger Junction and the smell of their food smelled great. I went home to ask my kids father if he ever ate there and as a kid he did fairly often. So I placed an order with them this evening and I must admit it tasted great for my first time. I have absolutely not one complaint and the staff there was very polite and friendly, making the experience that much better!!!! I would recommend this burger spot to anyone who loves to enjoy good burgers and fries!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ac5a815dd17ab:0x214c5d1a000d6438< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Back in the day, it was great.  Today, not so much.  I had to ask for more pastrami because there was only crumbs of it on the burger.  I also ordered fried mushrooms and they were fried too hard to eat!!!< /review>

The owners I believe are brothers and they're only one that cook which is probably why it's always perfect. All in all excellent all around.<//review>< pictures>

<text>The employees don’t Greet the customers or have any customer service experience. The girls don’t wear gloves while making food. I seen one of the girls get on her phone and not wash her hands, then go back to making food!!! Also floors are Dirty place not clean enough. I won’t ever eat there again until they train Their employees and clean the place up!!!! Because of the CustomerService and everything elseIt takes away from the food been good< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Definitely one of the best burger joints in Sacramento! They have a very comprehensive menu consisting of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fish and chips, fries my goodness, go and give them a try if you're in the neighborhood! They have an old-fashion feel and the food always makes the customer feel satisfied.<//Review>

<Text>From the moment you take your first bite, you find out that this is not your typical burger. The bun is not your ordinary sesame bun. It is a bun with a slight pleasant crisp. If you are familiar with a Mexican Bolillo, that is what it taste and feels like.

The patties are juicy and flavorful. I specifically got the avocado burger. I enjoyed the combination of flavors it had. I wish I would have eaten it with Jalapeños.

My wife got the Bacon Burger. The bacon was crispy and thick.

Unlike other burger joints, this place has alcoholic beverages.

I also had the Pineapple Shack. I really like it  because it was not too sweet. In fact it was the right amount of sweet.

With respect to the place appearance, It almost feels like you are going back in time to the 90s because of the decor and menu.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< userid>

<Text>I hate to give a one star!! But the cashier was rude barley wanted to answer my simple question regarding menu? Homeless male walks in and ask her to fill up a water cup that he brought in from outside. This is awesome that the restaurant did not turn him down I think that’s awesome but wear gloves before touching orders the male had scab and needle marks all over, she did not even wash hands after (ewww) Young lady helping make the sandwich did not wear gloves and rubed her nose with the top part of her hand gross! My self and my Co worker will not eat her again plus’s we wiped down are own table while the cashier watched and did not offer! Burger was a positive and the cook older male very polite and clean!  Not usually a critic felt it should be comon Since.<//Text>< GmapID>

I have been coming there since the mid 80's when they opened and over the years, I'd stop in just to see if they still make some of the best hamburgers I've ever tried and lo and behold, they are still hands down some of the best tasting burgers around. This is a must eat spot!!<//Review>

I give this places 3 1/2 stars. I got the giant junction, which while big it didn't have as much pastrami as I would have liked The shake was good but expensive and the fried mushrooms were ok at best. I would recommend this place but I wouldn't return if there were a better option on the table< /review>

Family owned and a long time envolved in the local community. Thier burgers are amazing....the bread alone is worth the trip there. They offer a variety of amazing sides like fried zucchini, fried mushrooms etc. They do offer vegetarian options but the owner has been making my father in law sauteed mushroom sandwiches for years before a "veggie" burger was even probably thought about. Thats what keeps us going....my father in law had very few options to eat when he worked in the area 30 years ago....the owner of burger juction made him sauteed mushroom sandwiches to meet his medical need to only eat a vegetarian diet. We only go in every few months and he still recognizes  my father in law every time we go and that is so special and a tribute to how much they care. Its not a new flashy burger joint, its full of old photos and i think an old car club comes in on the weekends, but irs worth the visit. They really care about thier customer!< /review>

<review>The burger i got was really good the fries were ok but plane. I spent about $13 for a great burger fries and a drink not to bad. They dont have meal deals everything is individually bought. Would give five stars if fries had more flavor. I will be back for an awesome burger when im working in the area. I recommend this joint.< /review><user>104992019466922677951</user>< gmapID>

< Review>
My burger was one of the worst burgers I've had in a long time. I called in my order today. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Online it said there would be 5 pieces of bacon. There was only one piece of bacon. Not even close to half of the burger had bacon on it. Might as well have had no bacon. On top of that the meat was gristly; I bit down on something hard that I had to remove from my mouth. So it made me wonder about he quality of the meat. Not much tomato on the burger either, and I love tomato. There are sooo many good burger places nowadays, I can think of like 10 off the top of my head, so therefore I would not return here. I don't know about their other burgers, but I don't reccomed the bacon cheeseburger, unless you specify that you want a lot of bacon. To me it's just unacceptable to serve me this burger with one piece of bacon. I don't know what they were thinking. And of course I had to pay extra for that measley piece of bacon. Maybe they will see this review and improve the bacon cheeseburger. But I will not give business to a place that is stingy with their ingredients. I can't stand that. Don't be cheap to save money, this seems like one of those places. Sorry if that's harsh but I'm really disappointed with this burger and I prefer to spend my money at a place that cares more about the quality of the food. I'm also disappointed that other people seemed to have good experiences and I had such a bad one. But this is definitely one of those experiences where you end up feeling like you just wasted your money cause the food was so bad. Not gonna take this risk and waste my money here again when there's so many places that always serve me a good burger.<//Review>

SO RUDE. It was more than obvious that the cashier did not want to help us. Did not greet us at all and  was resting her head on her fist like she could care less that I was a customer. Not coming back again.<//review>
