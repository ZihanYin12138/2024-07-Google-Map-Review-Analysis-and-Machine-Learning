<Rate>1< /Rate><Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Install crew was late and then made comments thinking we could not hear them about why did we think they would be here at the scheduled time. Left trash on the ground, roof and under the panels after the installation. Did not show up the second day like they said they would to commission the system so I wasted my Saturday waiting for them. Not happy with the installation process at all and hopefully this is not an indication of how things will be going forward!< /Review>< userid>

Where do I start.  Vivint was quick to sell and quick to start the install.  The install is still not done.  They showed up on a Friday 3 weeks ago to start the install.  They were in a rush to finish but the sun went down and it was dark so they had to stop.  They asked me to do the walk around but I explained to them that it was dark and there was no way for myself to see the work they did and I explained that we would have to do the walk around another day.  Well the next day I get up in the morning to head to work and my garage door will not open.  I check the usual things like the GFI and plugs.  No luck there so I checked the breaker panel and I found that a few breakers were off.  I didn't want to turn them on because The system was not done and I didn't want to mess anything up.  I try calling Vivint and what I found out is they use a offshore call center.  Well I explained the the call center I need to get my garage open and if they can send someone to see what we needed to do that was safe for the solar system to turn that breaker back on.  Well no body came out and I tried calling again to get someone to come out.  In that time I found out my bathroom plugs didn't work.  So because they didn't finish and I didn't want to turn the breakers on my self because I didn't know exactly were they were at in the wiring of the box.  I kept calling and the same thing over and over well have some one contact you.  long story short a guy came out took a picture that he turned on the breaker and said I was good to go.  I returned home still no power in the bathrooms and garage.  I called the guy back to let him know what was going on .  after a few days later he showed up again and said it was a loose ground wire that he forgot to tighten up.  I returned home and nope still have problems with power to the plugs in the bathroom and garage.  I explained to him through text hey have to come fix this I need to open my garage door.  No response no response so I asked him through text what's his company's contractors license and what insurance does he carry.  Still no response so I'm back to calling the Vivint customers service number.  They said they will have someone call me on Monday.  I'm not a electrician by trade but this is not a difficult fix.  Especially sense it was working before they started the install.  They forgot to hook up a wire in the box.  Bad customer service bad tech support will not call you back.  I starting to think Vivint hired a sub-contractor that does not have a contractors license .  I'm going to get to the bottom of it.</text>

I would like to share my experience with Vivint Solar. I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in their service and professionalism.
My husband passed away December 21, 2020. I contacted Vivint Solar of my husband's passing and they informed me of all the documents they would need from me. It was at this time they said they needed to send someone out to inspect my panels and I scheduled with them to come out Jan 5, 2021. The serviceman said it would require a Technician to come out due to there was a short.  I told him okay please disconnect thevsrrvice due to I didn't want to chance a fire if there was a short and he said he did.
I then made another appointment for January 29, 2021 and after spending half the day waiting I get a call that the Technicaln called in sick and they needed to reschedule. So they made an appointment for February 2, 2021. When the Technician arrived he informed me this required him to get on the roof and he was not certified to get on the roof and I needed to reschedule.  My appointment was then scheduleded for March 18, 2021. The Techniciann shows up and he informed that he was on doctor's order and had not been released to access the roof and needed to reschedule. So I contacted Vivint and they rescheduled for March 24, 2021 and it was a no show. So again I reschedule for April 19, 2021 and the Tech said he needed to order a part. I asked how long does it take to get the part. He said about 2 weeks but due to COVID it might take an extra week or so.  Nothing for the whole month of May. Finally June 3, 2021 Vivint came out and installed the part. Now remember I'm  dealing with the death of my husband and being inundated with all these inexcusable appointments.
Today June 15, 2021 I receive a call stating I'm passed due on my Vivint account for $715.00 dollars. I told them my service had been disconnected and the customer service person said, she was sorry for my loss but I owed this bill. I told HER I DID NOT HAVE SERVICE AND WASN'T PAYING FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T RECEIVE.  After getting no where with her I told her they could come get the panels and hung up.
If you are considering solar I highly discourage Vivint Solar.< /Text>

<Review>Installation of the solar panel went well yesterday. However, the workers did not take extra care of my roof tiles and found some damaged and also the gutter had dents and scratches. I'm  little disappointed.<//Review>< Pics>

I just got my solar panels installed yesterday, so we haven’t gone live yet, but my sales representative Grant has been awesome to work with. He is extremely knowledgable and has been in constant communication with me every step of the way. He gives me updates on our progress and is always quick to respond to my text messages or phone calls.

The solar panel were installed in one day, those guys worked quickly and efficiently. They didn’t mess around and got it done.

I would highly recommend Vivint Solar for anyone who is interested in getting solar. If you need an honest, knowledgeable, hard working Vivint rep, ask for Grant. You won’t be disappointed.<//review>

The panels on our home were there when we moved in, so we took over the contract. For a year and a half now, we have been trying to get a meter installed so we can start using our panels. Every time we call, we get a run around about “your internet isn’t connected” “we’ll send a technician” and every time, the technician says we need a meter, and every time, no one calls us back or comes to install said meter. And now, we’ve been noticed that our “past due balance” has been sent to collections. How can we have a past due balance when our panels aren’t even working?? I just want the panels off my house at this point but they won’t do that either. Terrible phone customer service, I would never recommend this company to anyone.</text>

<Review>If I could give negative stars I would. I deeply regret not fighting to get out of my system in the beginning when the trouble first started in 2016. All started with a lying, shady AF salesmen who later got fired and has just been all downhill since. Now this year I have a tru-up bill that has DOUBLED since last years, constant system issues and customer service reps telling me I’m stuck for 20 years unless I buy it outright in 2022. Definitely think Twice before buying into this SCAM!<//Review>< Date>

We are very happy with Vivint Solar and Mac. There were no problems with the install and the inspection. Mac has been able to answer all of our questions. Having the bird proofing done put my wife and I at ease. All of the employees were professional and cleaned up before they left. We are looking forward to PGE flipping the switch.

Happy home owner,

<Date>1585094553560</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>9 months ago we signed a contract with Vivint sales rep. Adrian Luna in Oakdale, Ca. The panels were installed 2 months later. Now 7 month after installation we are still not connected to the PG&E grid. We have been calling Vivint since December and can never get anyone from management to return calls. We finally found the appropriate department in PG&E where we learned that Vivint never submitted the proper forms to have us connected to the grid. Apparently the people you reach at Vivint are there just to screen your calls so management never has to be bothered by you. Our next call will be to our attorney. We never have dealt with a business as outrageous as this.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Vivint Solar Company is the WORST company ever. I wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy!! My mother and aunt has had panels on there roofs for over a year and still isn’t hooked up. Excuse after excuse. The sale person by the name of Michael Miller completely lied about the whole process! Had my mother and my aunt sign a iPad that was blank saying that they were saying a document for PG&E to hook up the solar. That was complete lie! They were told that they had  signed a contract. They had know idea that they were signing a contract. They also forged my mothers name on a document I saw the document that was forged and it wasn’t my mothers signature! This is completely against the law! There is a lot more that has been done through this over year long process,  to much to type. Again this is has been going on for over a year!!!! This is deplorable to say the least!  Mind you my mother is 82 years old and my aunt is 78 years old. This is taken granted of the elder! I called 2 months ago and told them everything that has been going on and all the lies that’s have been told. I was told that they were sorry and going to take care of it and also look into the forge document. Mind you the gentleman that spoke to me pulled up the document that was forged he told me yes your right it isn’t your moms signature! I still haven’t heard a word from anybody. I’m not sure how they are getting away with all there lies and illegal actions that have taken place! If something isn’t done soon I will be contacting a lawyer and will be taking action! I’M DONE!!!!!!!</Text>< Rating>

The work was good but the workers need to be more aware of the home owners.  They stepped on my plants, left a caulking gun on my trellis and left the caution tape up in my Backyard.  Very nice guys but they don't pay attention to the details of total customer service. More training is needed.< /review>

Ahshia has been such a great person to work with. She is honest and will not pressure you into something that you dont want. You will explain everything that you need to know about solar. She has been working in the solar field for a long time. If you need a solar person to speak with I would recommend Ahshia.<//Text>

<Review>First off, my name is still misspelled. It should be Blakely.  Chris has been great always accommodating and available.  Everything to this point has been very quick. I had expected the inspector to have been here early this week but have not yet heard from them.  I also hope someone will be showing us how we can view everything that is on the website.
So far no complaints.<//Review>< Pictures>

The gentleman Steve was very friendly. and introduced himself.  The other gentleman I did not get to meet before he got up on the roof.  Steve warned me because they did not get here till 2pm, they may not get to  complete the job because it will get dark.  I am glad he told me.  As it turned out they did complete the installation, but have to come back to take pictures and turn the system on.  I was not disappointed.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>My rep Luis was very thorough when explaining the contract and the process.  At no point did I feel pressured into something, in fact it was one of the smoothest transactions I have ever experienced.  The fact that I didn't have to front a big deposit up front made it that much better.  Overall, I am very happy with my experience and have since recommended Luis and Vivint to friends and family.<//Review>< Time>

I give 4++ stars.
The salesman Nate was wonderful. He walked us through the process. Everything went very smoothly not like the last company that came out and went all the way then dropped out just before the install.
Vivínt was very good and easy to understand and had good follow thru. Would have been 5 stars except for a glitch in scheduling the install. But when they came the crew was very guilty and clean and they got it installed, cleaned up, explained what they did etc. in the exact amount of time as I had been told to expect. Thanks<//review>

I have had Vivint Solar for the past 7 months.  After receiving by first billing statement I became very alarmed and knew something wasn’t right.  I contacted Vivint Solar, my first attempt was to my sales person (Clint Williams badge # 94791) with no response.  I then placed one of many calls to their corporate office to get to the bottom of my extremely high billing.  I have spent hours on the phone over the past several months trying to find a resolution to this matter with no support, concern or follow through from Vivint Solar.  Meanwhile the crazy high bills just keep coming.  After doing a lot of research and spending over an hour on the phone with a PG&E Solar Support employee I found the issue.  I was informed that the permit that was sent to PG&E by Vivint Solar stated that my kWh usage was 13,000 when in fact it was only 9,700.  Vivint Solar then provide me with 39 panels to support 16,000 kWh.  Being that Vivint charges you based on how much energy that is being generated by your panels not by the amount of energy you are using, 16,000 kWh is way over producing for the size of my home and my kWh needs.  I have been over billed and talked in circles for the past 7 months.  Not to mention that installation process took over 8 month and was extremely unprofessional and frustrating.  My sales person also promised me $250.00 for a referral I made that was never paid.  I am now considering this to be a fraud situation and will be seeking legal representation.

Thank you,

I had Vivint Solar panels put on my roof in August of 2017. Today is July 28 2018, and nothing is running yet. I was told by the salesperson that it should be from 4-17 weeks for all paperwork and inspections to be done. Well we are just about 52 weeks in and Vivint Solar is not working. My system should have been on since January 2018, but since it was raining and not much sun out I wasn't really worried. But once the sun started to come out I starting getting a bad feeling so I started calling. So many excuses and they were all directed at PGE. So I asked to speak to supervisor but none available. I was told a supervisor would call me back the next day, that was months ago and I yet to hear from a supervisor. The only way I got there attention was after I started posting reviews like this one on different social media platforms. I posted on the Vivint Solar website, yelp, bbb, consumer affairs, Call Kurtis from the news, and now this one. I have an annual payment due in a couple months and have asked Vivint Solar to help with that since my system hasn't even been up any part of this year. But the rep is giving me the run around. I have emailed the Vivint Solar CEO twice already and can't get help from him either, so to all that are looking into solar, please please please do not even look at Vivint Solar. Save the headache and go elsewhere.<//Review>

< review>
I have the same problems since i had my solar panels the first few months were okay but after getting trup bill that they did pay because the sales person said i would not have to pay that bill only monthly, now i have a second trup bill for 900 again but now i canot get a hold of sales person, he told me if we were not satified that they will come back and remove the solar panels. Now i got a second set of panels that took them 6 months to get the ok from pg&e while the whole time pg&e was charging me more because i was usuing their power. So now im stuck with two bills from vivnt wich are 98 dollars each, and i still have to pay the trup bill thats now at 800 and still get charged from pg&e about 200 a month, in the end im stuck witll 4 bills and saving no money. There was alot i was told and from talking to a ladie on the phone she pretty much said oh well ur stuck for the next 20 years when the sales person told me there was no long term 20 year account. Im not satified at all...< /review>

<review>Warning about using Vivint solar:
This is absolutely the most awful company to work with. The contract states that they will maintain the panels on your home; however, our panels had not been in communication with Vivint since April and they didn't even catch it! That's their responsibility. It wasn't until I called inquiring about the recent fires and potential for them to clean the pannels that anyone came to notice that there was no communication. This means they had been producing energy but not crediting it to us. There's a whole laundry list of other issues that I have with them but this is my greatest concern. They are also super shady. A rep contacted me in a panic via email, voice call, and text messages asking for our recent PG&E bill. Andy Kresge is his name and now that I've sent him the bill, he's not returning any of my messages.<//review><Name>Anjuli Martin-Hollman</Name></record></dataset><record>

I'm from stockton & when usually someone comes & talk about solar at my door. I slam the door. It's so many weird ways they try to explain you can get it but set up & activation fees made it not worth it. But I noticed my neighbor had vivint for a some years. When he told me that he paid  nothing I had to do some research.when I found out it was true. I immediately told my neighbor to give that guys number to come out. He gave me the run down. & set me up for a flat rate with no payment towards the panels. Everything insured through them for 20 years I just pay for cheaper power. So big thanks to vivint<//text>

Hard to get a hold of.  Had an electrician at our house that left a mess all over.  And found out later that he messed up on the new electric panel he put in.  Bought a new air conditioner and oven to find out later the electrician left the wires to short.  So the fuse kept blowing out.  Called a manager to complain and never got a call back.</Text>

Really good burgers, for a good price.  A filling meal, a Duo with side and drink, is around $10, and has two large sliders and really good chips.  Larger burgers around about $8 to $10.  Service is kind and fast.
They also have vegetarian and Keto options. And all their food is to Halal standards.
A new favorite burger joint!<//Review>

First time trying Burger IM and it was okay. Wasn't blown away by the burgers or fries. Didn't dislike them and would eat there again. But the patty, buns and sauce were average at best. Patties were not seared enough to result in the Maillard Reaction (nice flavorful crust). Definitely needed salt and pepper.  I think too these slider style burgers are prone to drying out before you can get a good sear on them. It was definitely filling and I've definitely had worse. But with so much competition in the space I have several others that I would choose instead. Like I said I'll be back at some point and probably try more flavorful toppings as I kept it standard for my first try. But this visit did not leave me with a craving to get right back.</Review>

Meat quality was good especially for halal burgers. They are usually a pre-formed patties.

However, they could have been seasoned better. The actual meat prior to the condiments.

The Hawaiian 🍔 was blah

And, when they say spicy, it really wasn't spicy at all.</text>

It was nice how we were able to customize our choices but I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the food. The bread buns were too squishy for our preference, my sister had added avocado in her burger but found out that the avocado was a super old one with some parts of it starting to spoil. Our meal was around a sum of $12, this deal came with fries and a drink so it was acceptable but still the food quality was a 2/5. Gave it a 3 start for it's friendly service and cleanness of the shop.</text>< userid>

The burgers were super tasty and high quality. Great bread (similar to Fuddruckers) and the upgraded meats are totally worth it. Super juicy beef and great flavor. I particularly liked the one with cumin in it and got it California style and was overwhelmed with flavor.
The ordering process can be a bit tricky/tedious especially if you've never been here. I think it's because they encourage you to order lots of burgers but each one has to have all the details ironed out. If there's a line behind you the pressure is on to order fast.< /review>

Whether it's the Duo or the Triple Slider Combo... you can't go wrong. Mix and match your own choices... NO pun intended... of meat patties and toppings 👍🏾👍🏾<//text>

Decided to try this place after a long drive back to town. Placed the order online for two chicken sandwiches and a burger , in which the description does not include cheese as an item in the sandwich . I added a memo on the order for no cheese on the chicken sandwich  and it Still came with cheese. I also ordered onion  rings for an additional charge instead of fries , which I did not receive. All and all horrible experience for how much it was.  Save your money or go to in and out. At least they get your order right.</Text>

No, things are not made up in advance. They will make your burger, french fries, onion rings, Etc. When you order them and pay for them. So you order at the counter pay for it and they bring the food to your table. What makes him special is they have regular sized burgers and then they have a whole series of smaller burgers with 3 oz patties so the end up being sliders. But that's a great way to sample because the menu has the duo which is a choice of two sliders or the trio which is a choice of three sliders. The duo is $6.99 and the trio is $9.99. I had the Duo and I chose the lamb and the Angus beef. They offered 12 different burgers were sliders.

I really liked my choices as an initial sampling  of the sliders. Both were very good. I'll be going back to sample more of the various proteins which include chicken salmon Nana variety of different varieties of beef.</Text>< Pics>

Very tasty! Love the keto option, and all the other fresh ingredients! Only thing is the tables were all dirty, so we had to clean one ourselves to sit and eat. We will definitely go back.< /text>

<Review>These burgers are the perfect size. Little bit larger than a slider, not as big as a full size. Onion rings were hot and crunchy thick slices of battered goodness. Sweet potato fries were good. Amount of fries in the order was generous. Can't wait to go back.< /Review>< Pictures>

The best place to get burgers in Dublin. The service isnt necessarily fast, but a great burger takes time and I'm good with that. The fries, milkshakes and wings are good as well. Live the multiple burger types they offer. Will definitely be returning< /Review>

I've been here a handful of times since it's opened. The interior is fresh and inviting, clean with a usually friendly staff. The menu is a little complicated particularly if you are ordering a burger with a little customization, but after your first go around its no problem. It always seems the staff expects some confusion and is helpful. The burgers - you can order the duo or trio combo, and it's possible to order two or three different burger combos or all the same. There is a choice of aged beef, spiced, etc. Chicken, salmon and veg. All are good choices depending on your mood. There's also a 1/3 lb single burger. The fries - personally, I'm not a fan of sweet potato fries, but they are good. Regular fries are sliced potatoes, flat like a chip, but not as thin. The problem with the fries, they get cold fast for some reason, and never seem to have just come out of the fryer, same goes for the onion rings(rings are tasty). Hence the minus one star. Chicken wings - choice of flavors are flavorful, and the consistency of the wings are well balanced and tasty. The family pack is a good option and may be cheaper than ordering individual combos for each member  so pay attention to that when ordering. The party box is a cool idea if your having visitors. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to eat there, if you are cost conscious, explore the menu before going so you don't feel pressured when ordering. 4 out of 5 for me. Minus 1 for generally room temp fries and overall cost.<//review>

Pleasanton-Server- Arina V, order#35 06/4. Picked up by Ali, I ordered 24 wings for $19.99 from the menu and was charged separately for 12 wings $12.99 and 12 wings $12.99 total of $25.98 instead of $19.99. I called, the call was picked up by Lisa who placed me on hold and after waiting for 10 mins she didn't realize I was on call instead answered saying "how can I help" when I said I was placed on hold by her she blatantly responded saying her manager will call back. I am really disappointed by the service and want the extra charge to be refunded. Also,  your staff needs to be trained on taking orders and on how to provide good customer service. This is not the first time I've faced issues with this location, this is the third instance.</Review>

Great food & service! I recommend the Merguez style patty. Sweet potato fries are usually hit or miss at most places but it's been consistently good here. Onion rings were good, too. I think there are a bit too many options but once you find some favorite combos to stick with it's right up there between Five Guys & In-N-Out.< /Review>

Burger was juicy and flavorful, but something seemed off.

Also in the giant meal packs it doesn't advertise you must have 4 of the same.  I felt the advertising was a little misleading.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fe9693d5601f5:0x53a0fbfec8642ce0<//Gmap_id></record>

Two tomato slices the size of quarters, a few small slices of onion, huge piece of lettuce. Had my burger delivered to the table and was told my fries would be right out but never received them. Only thing good was the soda. Never eat here again!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great burgers and fries.  I love the fries!  The Spanish beef is the burger to get for those who don't mind a little spice with a ton of flavor!< /Review>

The fries!!!! I can't stop thinking about their fries.... sweet baby Jesus blessed them with a magnificent recipe. They were crunchy on the outside and soft and flavorful on the inside, just how I like them!!! I kept talking about them later that night....< /text>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>This place has a ton of really good options! Halal, vegetarian, keto, it's all here, not to mention the IMpossible! I got the duo deal (burgers only) and got one lettuce wraps and one with bun. The wagyu beef was cooked through (its better rate, but I understand), and the maege(?) beef (tasted like it had cumin on it, similar to curry) was perfectly juicy. The 3 oz versions of your preferred combos here are very adequate and affordable, so I would totally suggest the duo for variety and quantity! The sweet potato fries and plain chip fries were also tasty, not too salty, and fresh (I prefer them crispier though!). They didn't hear my bf order the sweet potato fries, but fixed the problem right quick. Good place, nice service, and solid food. Definitely hit the burger craving.</Text><Date>1574646984727< /Date><gmap_id>0x808fe9693d5601f5:0x53a0fbfec8642ce0< /gmap_id><Name>Lynn Chayatanan< /Name>< rating>

I love the burgers here. All very organic from start to the end. You actually choose all the ingredients you want on your burger and have it cooked the way you want. The fact that the all meat is Halal is just another big plus for me.</review>

Clean and tastefully setup. Unfortunately the tomatoes where very cold and the meat seemed to be reheated. So, ice cold tomatoes, dry meat and dry bun.
Not impressed, this place needs to stop by 5 guys for a lesson in burgers. MOIST. Lol<//Review>

Delicious lunch but on the pricey side. There is an option for two or three sliders and you can add a side with a drink for extra. Friendly staff but you need to pay extra to get the better ingredients.<//review>

Burgers or should I say the sliders were great.  I would stay away from the burger with the mederanian spices unless you like those spices because, you really taste them.  Can't say I really noticed much difference in taste between the normal ground beef, Aged beef, and the wagyu beef.  Just save your money and get the aged beef, wagyu costs extra.  In n Out was my favorite till now.</review>

The order menu also does not tell you what other toppings you can add onto your burger, and everything is 79¢ per burger. So if you get a trio, with 3 toppings each, that's $7.11 of add-ons.</Review><user>112427359145924621511<//user>< pictures>

Burgers are more like sliders only a tad bit larger than a slider.  Good selection of meats though makes up for it.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Fast service, good portion (trio), and great flavors. I was unsure what to expect from the mix of 5, 4, and 1 star reviews but was glad I gave Burgerim a go. I got the trio with Merguez, Wagyu, and Aged Beef. I liked the Merguez the best as the beef is seasoned where as the other two are more about the meat only.

Burger styles are caliente which has jalapenos and pepper jack, california which has avocado and swiss (I think), simple which is just American cheese and pickles, lettuce, tomato.

Also tried the sweet crunchy garlic wings and they were awesome. Wings have a lot of meat, texture was great, and the taste was incredible. Easily some of the best wings I've had.

Where I think the comments on wait come from: it takes forever to pick what type of burger you want. We noticed people in line taking several minutes to place an order. Look at the menu ahead of time and know what you want to eat.

Place is clean, however, there is an odor of fried oil in the air that will permeate your clothes so be sure not to have any meetings right after.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I paid north of $1.1k for my four tires at Skips, then returned for a flat tire, it is supposed to be complimentary service but TWICE Skips asked me to come next day, obviously this is denial of service and violation of the sales contract. Add to that,  borderline confrontational attitude from the manager and the service person next to him at the cashier. And before I get a response from Skips management for this posting, which I will appreciate, please check with your shop manager and offer basic training in treating paying customers respectfully. I had to go somewhere else to deal with my flat tire, which is considered an EMERGENCY, and for Skips to let down their customers and offer this level of poor service they are telling the world that business model is after they get paid they will not honor warranties through tricky business tactics. Moving forward, I will skip Skips..!!</Text>< user>

Had a blowout on 101. Called Skip’s and they managed to get me in, replaced the tire, and adjusted my alignment all in a few hours. Though they were fully booked with appointments they made time to help me out. Exceptional customer service - both Andy and Anthony. Very appreciative of them taking care of a guy from out of town who was caught in a bind as he was passing through. Highly recommend.<//Text>

I have been doing services with this location for over 15 years. The team is awesome and very responsive and helpful. Over the years I have my Toyota, Honda, Lexus, trailer, boat and BMW and now my Porsche services here and never have a problem. There prices are much lower then the dealers and they give you recommendations only on what you actually needed and not on some predetermined schedule. They will tell you to fix or replace what they see in their inspection and not what recommended in the manual. This will save you a lot of money. That is why I trusted their services and recommendations. None of my cars have any problem over the years with their recommended services.  I will guarantee you will be happy with their price and services like I am.<//text>

<review>Just a great experience with great customer service from Nick in the shop and Andrew working on the vehicle. I brought my car over with two nails at 5pm with the shop closing at 6 and the team found a way to get my mustang in to patch the tire and send me home happy. I’ve bought tires from this business 3 times over now and have had to come back for fixes/replacements a few times over due to my awful luck, and the business always takes amazing care of me.

Don’t bother taking your car to another location or pay attention to the salty reviews below that do not understand how a reputable business with volume is run - come to a spot that is efficient, fair, time sensitive, cost effective and easy to work with. 4 thumbs up.<//review>< name>

Made the mistake of having a repair performed on the weekend.  Place is very busy, so next time will attempt to only go on weekdays.

I just needed to have a flat repaired (on a new tire; therefore, was under warranty).  The wait was over 2 hours, but once the mechanic got started, he was able to knock it out in about 20 minutes.

The service advisers were very competent and attentive, keeping me informed on what was happening.  There are several eateries nearby, which helped to make the wait go faster.

Good place.< /Review>

Honesty, integrity and excellent communication skills displayed by the team.  I took my car for strut replacement to Skips based on the recommendation of the dealership service center following a regular service. Skips team inspected, and informed that my struts were just fine and did not need replacement at all, plus did not charge a single penny for inspection. Tons of thanks to Skips Tire and Auto Repair Center.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Skips on Cottle is amazing. I have a Boxster which is primarily used on the track. I had some last minute alignment adjustments I wanted to make before an event. I gave Skips the camber and toe numbers I wanted and they were able to dial those in for me. Very appreciative of them going above and beyond what I expected. We also use them for many of our other cars.< /Text>< Response>

I rather give them a 3 instead of a 5 stars, this 5 stars goes to Carlos that try his best to help the customers. NOT because of their management or lack of.  I dropped off the wheel that I removed for them to replace the tire. Dropped off at 9:30am and was told it will be done by noon. I asked again and again the manager said by "NOON". They will reinstall the wheel back on when i come back at noon. I called back at noon, the manager said that his team was on lunch. Might take a few more hours. I drove by. The tire was still in the same spot were he left it this morning. But I saw they're working on different  vehicles. That annoyed the hack out of me. I'm a reasonable person, but my time is costly. I know business is struggling during this pandemic. So don't disappoint your customers. That will effect your business revenue. This is the first time I'm at Skip Tire. No matter how much marketing you guys do, word of mouth from a customer are always better and it doesn't cost you guys a single penny.<//review>

Great customer service. Andrew kept calling to check in with me about my car. Let me know what was going on before proceeding with anything done to my car. Initially went in to get new tires, but also needed new battery. They were able to get me my new tires and replace my battery as well !<//Text>

Andrew was amazing. He took care of me soon as I walked in the door. Walked me through every step of what was going to be done to my car. When something else was needed, he always called and gave me a quote. I have been bringing my car here for the past two years and there’s no other replace I trust.<//text>

The salesman was very knowledgeable and helpful. when he heard I had a flat tire he bubble tested the tire to figure out if it was repairable or not. Took a lot of his time. Unfortunately since I was traveling I was not able to buy any tires from him. But if I was in the area I would< /review>

Besides delaying the delivery of my car. the seats all came black and the door was all dirty, I asked to clean it, they didn't like it. after riding the car I saw that the tires were not calibrated. I do not recommend. I lost a lot of time and a lot of money. Yesterday I paid 200 dollars to clean and sanitize my car seats and today they do this to me. I don't recommend it and I won't be back. Lose time and money< /Review>

He gave me his advisement without any pressure. I'm a little poorer from all the service done today, but am amazed at how quickly everything was done!

I bought 2 brand new Michelin pilot tires here for my car back 2 years ago. I barely drive my convertible with less than 4000 mile per year.  They pushed my hard to buy their insurance guaranteeing that would cover puncture repair or replacement with simply normal wear and tear. Today I have a simply nail puncture and they refused to fix the simple puncture by telling some lame excuses that my insurance would not applied and I need to buy another tire to be “safe”. This is the 2nd encounter with the same issue that I had before and I trusted them and bought a new tire and insurance. Watch out when they say “safe” to get you. Avoid this place.< /text>

<Review>We bring all of our cars to Skips for amazing service.  This is the “ mechanic you can trust” and here’s a good example: check engine light went on on 2007  MDX, and it was linked to the Cat Converter.  They recommended I run a cat clean additive first before spending $2000 on a cat converter, and sure enough that did the trick and turned off the check engine light. Now that is good old fashioned great service!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Date>1567720769234< /Date><rating>5</rating><Text>I've purchased tires here for 3 cars in the last 2 years. I've always felt I've received the best information regarding possible tires for my car. Prices are fair and service is fairly quick. Dont expect to just show up and get new tires for your car while you wait. I'd make an appointment.  They are very busy. Dropped my car off for tire rotation and alignment at 730am. Done by 11am. So not really fast, but that was fine with me. My only complaint would be, we purchased the tire protection for my daughters car. She got a nail in the tire. They wouldn't fix it without her leaving her car overnight. Seems to me they should rethink that process especially when a customer paid additional money for tire protection.  I'm guessing it's a 20 minute repair for a competent tire buster. Anyway, I recommend this place. Other than what I stated I've got no complaints.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Very disorganized for a corporation store, I went to website for appointment,  and I got a confirmation email which when I got to their office: they indicated they did not receive confirmation appointment from the web.
It was 815 am when I got there, for nail in the tire. It took them till 515pm to fix. I understand that because of the pandemic things are disorganized, and staff needs to move slower  to be mindful  of virus, but in my opinion I see areas for optimization for a manager.<//Text>

<date>1558562271419<//date><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>I’m leaning between 2-3 stars because I know Skip would have never let my car or me leave feeling the way I did. My purchase included high end tires, brakes, and alignment on my Chrysler 300. $3000 out the door. The same day I drop off our minivan for tires $700 so both my cars are at the shop at the same time. I pick up the minivan first and no problems. Get a call a few hours later my Chrysler 300 is ready for pickup. When I get there I’m excited to see my car with new tires. The car is my pride and joy. I love driving this car. As I walk by I notice the Black 22” wheels have white wheel weights. No problem right? I figure they’ll paint them black or pull the car in and switch out the weights. Nope, the salesperson Francisco tells me that I should have said I wanted black wheel weights. I’m blown away by his response. I just spent $3700 and you would expect they would take pride in their work right! NO! Francisco continues to tell me, raising the tone of his voice, if You are particular about you car you should have said something when you dropped it off. If this kid knows Skip he wouldn’t be talking like this. Back in the day Skip took care of his customers like they were family. I’m thinking this isn’t the case anymore. I’m off to find a tire shop I can trust to fix my situation. I’m very disappointed!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1558732688800, 'text': 'We’re sorry that your experience with us wasn’t as good as it should have been.

Anthony was great and insightful. He truly wanted to ensure we understood the problem and provided clear options to changing my tires.

The shop is very clean and there is a good amount of parking.

I'll be going here from now on! Appreciate all your help and patience, Anthony.< /Text>

Took fender well covers off messed those up as well.  Told me that I was hearing things! I moved an left the state towed the van. Took it to a Goodyear shop here an right away told me the rear pad on one side was defective. Showed me the pad an rotor an that’s the noise. Funny 5 times at this place didn’t find it yet another shop found it first time. They don’t take the time to properly diagnose any problem if it is not obvious. I do not recommend you useing this location. If you value your safety an those of your family!<//Review>< pics>

I've been to Skip's a number of times over the years and have always had a positive experience.  Yesterday I went to get in my car and discovered my driver's side front tire was essentially flat.  I took the car to Skip's and was told it would be an hour to an hour and fifteen minute wait and there would be no charge to repair the leak, if possible.  Well, sure enough, I was out of there in an hour with the cost of a few signatures.  That was it!</Review>

I got a flat on my right rear tire today, I called skips to see if they had a tire my size available. I spoke with Francisco and requested just one tire. When I got to the shop Wendy checked the car in and Anthony took over the transaction. They had quoted me two tires at almost 500. Anthony must of gotten upset over the fact that I only wanted one, I just wanted a tire to get me home. I could deal with buying new tires once I got home which was over 200 miles south. I got there at 3:45 they said it would take an hour. I waited until almost 6, longest time I've waited for just one tire. At the time of check out Anthony was raising his voice, he was being really rude. To top it off they must of taken the TPMS Sensor off my wheel and kept it. They noted on the receipt that the TPMS light was on before they serviced it, obviously it was going to be on if the spare was on. It should have gone away after replacing the tire since I had a sensor on the wheel, but it stayed on the whole drive home. Which means one thing, they took the sensor off. Now I have to buy a whole new set of sensors awesome. I do not recommend this place at all. Go somewhere else not here.< /text>

<Text>Several weeks ago, I went to Skips out of convenience to fix a flat tire. When I entered all 3 employees were busy with customers. So of course I waited patiently until someone was free.

When one of them was free, instead of acknowledging me, he checked the mail, chatted with  another employee and then he  came to the counter and asked me, " Can I help you?"... No, I enjoy wasting my time standing in line!

Andrew, the manager, helped me.  He had this nonchalant attitude about him. I told him about the slow air leak, he checked the flat and the rest of the tires.

He recommended having all 3 tires replaced, the 4th tire still had plenty of tread. I agreed with him because the tread wear indicator was flush with the tread but I only replaced 1 at that time.

Other than Andrew's lack of customer service attitude. I wouldn't mind returning here if I was helped by another staff member. Like Nick or Charles, they were friendlier and more  concerned about helping their customers.< /Text>< pictures>

Awesome, awesome and awesome! Best customer service!  Bought a set of tires in July and got a great deal.  Had a blowout on the freeway (ran over something), called them this morning, they got me in and my tire is covered (buy the warranty).  They are a great team and I will continue to do my business with them! Thanks to all at Skips on Cottle!<//text>

<review>Just left there without any service being done.  Call ahead time to get a quote,  price sounded good,  so drove over there to have service done,  by the time they were writing the paper work,  the price almost went to double.  When I told them what the person said on the phone,  they basically call me a liar and had to show proof that I was calling the correct place.   Then telling me it would be impossible for someone tell me the price I was saying form his store     Should people start recording conversations to be not called a liar?   Anyways never going there again.  Thank for making me feel like a idiot< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
I do buy my tires here for over ten years. Usually have very good prices on their tires with knowledgeable staff. They always look for extra work and quote a that repair service at a premium rate.  I hope that they do not try the same tactics to old ladies and others that are not so car savvy  From friends, I heard that they do.  So, just for tires, Skips is great.  Just be prepared to say no to their extra work that they propose.</Review>

<text>Skips tire on Cottle Rd was The worst experience that I have ever had getting a simple tire replaced.  Every customer in that shop was complaining about the poor service both When I purchased the tire that should’ve been my first warning.  Not only did I pay too much for the tire but it took them a week to get a standard Michelin tire in and then charge me more.  When I went to pick the tire up they in for me it was going to take an hour to two hours to take my spare tire off and put the new tire on.  The store manager not only didn’t care about the poor service his shop was providing but then was confrontational about putting my tire on that I paid for then proceeded to talk down to me.  Not only would I never go back but I will make sure everyone that I talk to does not go there< /text>< gmap_id>

< review>
AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. I never do things like this but this time I just had to. They will up sell everything they have in store to make some money from your misery. In short, they misdiagnosed my issue and charged me through the roof for another issue that they "found" with one of their up sells. They tried to offer me 30 minutes of free labor (a FULL COST SAVINGS of 80$  for their diagnosis mistake). More details below.

I have had the worst experience possible at this repair shop. I went in for an issue with my Honda Civic 2010s charging system. There was no notable dimming of lights or anything indicating an issue with the battery but their electrical diagnostic victimized the battery due to low cold cranking amps. I paid 200$ for this battery replacement only to drive home and see my battery indicator go on/off intermittently (Some diagnostic they ran eh?). This was on a day that temperatures were almost at 105 degrees and I was stuck in traffic driving from SF to SJ for 2 hours with 2 kids in my backseat. I had to turn all my electronics including the air condition off to make it home (Uber was not an option because I was stuck in bumper to bumper traffic). I called them in and I was told to tow it in to their repair shop (I dont have AAA and towing would cost me another 250$).

I took the car back in and spoke to the manager, Andrew who did not have a good answer really other than running the diagnostic again to find that it is the alternator that is actually the victim (At this point he seemed to indicate that the battery was ALSO a problem which I do not believe for one second. I am no mechanic but I know my cars well enough and I told them multiple times to check the alternator and the belt because the battery was fairly new). I HAVE NEVER FELT more taken advantage of. The alternator would cost another 500$. When I asked about options for installing an alternator that is not OEM, the employee got super agitated only to tell me that they would not do something like that (which is okay but this could have been communicated in a much nicer way).

To add to all this, they sold a brake flush to me. I have not idea why I agreed to it but we are where we are now. While doing the brake flush, I got a call saying that now my left brake cylinder needs to be replaced because it has started leaking. Well it was not leaking before I got there and I had my entire brake system done for 1000$ plus 4 months ago. Anyhow the employee made it sounds like I would die if he put the car together without replacing the cylinder. This cost me another 230$. On top of all this, he had the audacity to up sell a brake drum clean for another 80$ AFTER i told him everything had been replaced 4 months ago (He actually called this an "upsell" too).

Anyhow, I am sitting in a Starbucks now while my car is being worked on by another mechanic.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. IF YOU NEED MORE DETAILS FEEL FREE TO MESSAGE ME. They risked the lives of multiple people and did not take any responsibility for it (other than offering me a whopping 80$'s in savings after I spent 677$ already). They may have some competent mechanics but definitely did not feel like they had any integrity.<//review>

Could not believe it!!! I got in my car yesterday morning and the warning light said to add air to one of my tires. I had this tire patched last summer at another location, and assumed that it was now time to replace it. So, after school, I limped into Skip's on Cottle Rd. (without an appointment) and thought since it was after 3:00, since I had no appointment, since they seemed very busy, etc. that I would have to take the bus, Uber, rent a car, etc. and leave my vehicle there for at least a day. Not only did they pump up this tire, they found a nail in another tire and fixed THAT one and... ... ...there was NO CHARGE!  I insisted that I had not purchased the tires from Skips, that they didn't do the repair, it wasn't their fault, etc. I even asked if they accepted donations. And I was assured by Andrew that no, that's not the way that they did business, and that they hoped that I would use them in the future for other needs. WOW. Couldn't be more pleased!</Text>

I've been taking my various cars here for at least 20 years. They stand by their work. They've actually told me when they didn't think a service was needed, and I've brought in a car for service and when I pick it up its actually a lower price than was quoted and approved.

I brought my car in for an oil change. I left Sunday and went straight home keep in mind I live on beswick close enough to walk. Drove to work Monday morning hearing a weird sound couldn’t quite figure it out. When I got to work I noticed one of my lug nuts was sticking out really far. So I brought it back to skips. And you know what I get? Sorry we didn’t see that. So it was a stud that broke but somebody couldn’t own up to it. How they can let me leave with that going on is beyond me. So now after I’ve paid $1300 and I’m told it’s safe to drive on 4 studs instead of five cause there busy is ok. I give no stars........<//text>

Let me start by saying A BIG THANK YOU TO ANTHONY for your amazing customer services and for keeping all promises you made in regards to my car. I hope you understand that my only reason for writing this review xx months later is so that i could test the new tires to make sure they perform exactly as you promised. I dont regret getting all 4 tires changed even though I was only planning to replace 2. I have to admit, Iam once again left a Happy and very Satisfied Customer!!!!

Honestly, these past few years that I have used Skip's Tire & Auto Iam amazed after each visit how friendly, caring and professional these guys are. Each one of you welcome your customers with a smile so bright, it will make someones worst day a happy day.

Happy Car + Happy Customer... = Thank You Skip's Tire 😊

Dealership prices.
Told me my battery was dead and were going to do a electrical systems test. Assumed that meant the battery needed a recharge as the alternator went out and the radio still played when the tow truck driver tried to turn over my car the day before. They replaced the battery without asking. They called back later and told me that it would be $330 to replace the alternator never told me the pricing of the battery.  Got in this morning and was told it was $500 for everything. Not happy at all.
Workmanship seems good on the alternator replace.</Text>

Pretty good service if you are buying tires or getting an alignment. I was disappointed that they would not help with a warranty replacement from another supposedly affiliated shop. Asked about a strut replacement and walked when I heard the labor rate ... but I suspect they are the same as others in the area would be.<//Review>

<Text>I took my car here on several occasions, each time because it was close to my home. I regretted it more with each visit but like I said, they were in a convenient location so I really wanted them to work out. My final service from them started in Feb for routine maintenance. My car broke down completely not 3 miles from Skip's garage. 2 months and four full days in the shop later, I was down $2500 and my car was in far worse shape than it was when I first took it in. Fast forward to today, I took my car to a DIFFERENT mechanic, who called and informed me that my front brakes looked like someone took a SAW to them and wondered who in the world last worked on my brakes. The answer: Skips. In fact, I paid them to replace my entire front brake system.

Honestly, I have a whole list of reasons not to take your car to this shop. I won't write the entire novel on all of my personal experiences with this shop that ended in disaster, but I will say that if you like having a car that runs and a bank account with money for things other than bogus repairs, take your business ANYWHERE but here.<//Text>< Resp>

<response>None</response><Time>1543792910051</Time><Text>I blew a tire hitting a road median one night. Car was towed to Skips, the next day. Since two other tires were not the best, I decided to buy 4 tires. With $20 per tire Road Hazard Insurance, price came near $700. I also scheduled an alignment but was told that I shouldn't do so for I "need ball joints". As it turned out, taking car afterwards to my mechanic, I was told  besides ball joints I have a BENT CROSS MEMBER. If I had known that,  I would have never put on a complete set of tires! So Skips can sees my car needed ball joints but NO ONE AT SKIPS NOTICES A BENT FRAME (Cross Member) ?? REALLY?? And did anyone notice at Skips that the right front wheel was PUSHED BACK 2" INTO THE WHEEL WELL? I GUESS NOT!
I called Skips later and was told they "sympathised" with my situation and offered info on where I might salvage my rims and tires.  Wow, thanks alot!  I've got a car with brand new tires on a car that I have to salvage. Thanks alot Skip Tires! I gave them one star for "sympathising" with me</Text></record>

Brought my car there for a leak in my tire, they said they would patch it. Easy peasy. After they "patched" the tire they didn't even charge me a dime! I was stoked! Left there with paperwork with a nice $0.00 balance.

I drove home, woke up the next morning surprised to see the flat tire again. I called them and told them what happened, and asked what they would do for me since I was now stranded at home with a flat tire they said they fixed. They wouldn't send a car with air, or even a spare tire to get me down to their shop, I had to get there myself (on a flat tire that they said they fixed) for them to look at it. Fine, I get it, I could be an axe murderer and you don't want to send an employee to someone's house on hearsay alone. Would have been nice, but I get it.

Here's what boils my blood. I took it to a different place and there wasn't even a plug where the puncture was! It's obvious when a tire has been patched or not, and this one was obviously skipped over. To their very mediocre credit, they were nice enough not to charge me for no work done.

You get what you pay for I guess. You gave me  0 service, here's the closest 0 I could give you. Shame, everyone at the desk seemed nice.<//text>

Can't speak for service, but this place is expensive!  $45 for a flat tire.  $120 for changing a light bulb (of which half was returned after complaining).  $60 for tire chains that cost $28 on Amazon.< /Text>

I'm assuming they're doing their job. But they don't know how to reset the computer in my car. For example, I took my car in for an oil change. They did the work, but a week later, my oil change light came on! I took it there for them to reset it, they still couldn't get it right. Finally found the answer on YouTube.< /review>

<Text>Dropped my car off with a matching set of tires. Wanted to put 2 tires on the back because they were worn and one had a slow leak. Picked the car up 4 hours later to see that they decided to put the tires on the front without asking plus I ended up with a different tire on the rear that wasn't there when I dropped it off . So i still have bad tires on the back and a slow leak. So if you want to go to a place that will do whatever
THEY want instead of what you want then go ahead and go there personally I will never go there again!!!!!!!< /Text>< pics>

I went there for a flat tire fix last Sunday. There was a sharp piece of metal in my tire which caused it to go flat. I was expecting to have to buy a new tire. They warned me the time it takes to fix could be approx. 2-hours. I was ok with that since it was a Sunday at lunchtime and I didn't have an appt. I got a call within less than one-hour that it was fixed. I went to pick it up, they repaired the tire and charged me FREE! What....no charge! Amazing! I have never been there before, didn't buy my tires from them and no charge! Wheel Works would have charged me for sure if I didn't buy the tires from them! Wow! Totally made my day!<//review>

<review>I went here because i live just down the road and they gav me the bet price on a set of tires. I took the car in and the guy looked at my tires and told me they were really still in good shape and i could come back when they actually need replacing. I never have someone tell me i dont need something at a auto repair shop. I was very impressed ended up getting my oil changed and a new air filter then they gave me a $10 off coupon.

<Review>Took  my recently acquired 64 El Camino to Skips for tires and rims. Josh was very helpful and took a lot of time making sure I had the right tires and rims for the vehicle (knew what rims I wanted but was not sure of the correct tire size).

The shop did an absoultely marvelous job of mounting, balancing, and making the needed  vehicle alignment changes. Car tracks absolutely straight.

I also used them to put on new tires on my wife's 2012 Ford Escape a few months back. That job was done perfectly as well.

I truy appreciate a job well done. Thanks!< /Review></record>

< Review>
I brought my car in because I had a major oil leak.  I waited 3 hours for for them to tell me that they did an oil change and then tell me that I have an oil leak.  Then they charged me $44 for the oil change.  I left with my car still leaking oil.< /Review>

I cannot believe it!  Pulled in with a flat tire and they said they cannot fix it because it is too close to 5:30pm.  Really?  Wow, I will never buy a tire from these guys.<//text>

Absolute rubbish customer service. We had an appointment to see a rental property they were listing , as we were out of town. We were advised to submit an application online for it but were reassured that we didn't have to do it until before our showing appointment on Tuesday due to the office being closed Memorial Day weekend

When I happened to look on Zillow today ( Saturday ), the property had been rented. I called the office and was told that yes the owner had accepted an application already. I let them know I had an apt Tuesday to see it ?
They said sorry but it has rented already

When were we gonna get a phone call letting us know about this ? To cancel our appointment. ?? Baloney !

We are thinking of renting out our home
we own in San Diego and will DEFINITELY not use this company. Piss poor service< /Review>

I am a former tenant of one of the properties they manage.  I always paid on time and left the property in pristine condition with a few upgrades. They have acted in a predatory way and do not respect or follow tenant laws.

They misrepresented their ability to enter the unit while we were occupying it by claiming they can enter if they give us 24 hrs, but had no valid reason to do so.

They have tacked on charges after we left even though they denied us a pre-move out inspection and did not send us at-least the pre-move out inspection list.

They lied to us when they communicated they would not be renewing our lease by claiming the owner was moving back in. Not two weeks after we left we say the owner had put up the house for sale on Zillow. to me it seems like they are also not communicating with the owners whose properties they are managing.

Whenever you communicate with them they are flippant, unprofessional, avoidant and callous in the way they operate. I do not endorse them in the least.

****Spare me your fake sympathy, you are just passing the buck to the owner. Those deductions wouldn't have happened if your company fulfilled their duty. We were never given a chance to address the deficiencies we were cited for and that's a clear violating of our renter's rights.

Trust me I have the lease and it won't stand up to the scrutiny of small claims court.****<//Review>

{'time': 1601659839321, 'text': 'Hi Maria,\nI am sorry that you had such a negative experience.\nFrom a company procedure perspective, we are not entering occupied properties unless it is an emergency. This is a common practice in the industry until progress is made with COVID.\nFrom a property perspective, the owner canceled our management services and told us he is moving in.  We had no right to challenge his instructions.  All charges to your deposit were determined by him.  We are transparent with our relationship by listing on the first page of the lease that we do not own the property, and that the owner (listed as landlord on the lease) makes all of the decisions with charges to the security deposit.\nWe will do everything we can to assist in resolving your security deposit dispute, but please keep in mind that it is not our decision to  make. I would be happy to send you a copy of the lease for reference if you do not recall the details.\nSincerely,\nBill Ausen\nBroker'}<//Response>

I was a out-of-state homeowner with them for ~ 14 years and this team was great to work with.  Even when my main representative left the company to have a baby the replacement person was just as awesome.  First I had a revolving door of 4 college roommates, replacing someone about every 3 months!  AHP did all the background checks and contracts without a hitch.  I'd say this was about 20 roommate replacements!  Then I got lucky with a long term older woman who just needed help with maintenance items.  Their maintenance contractors were also prompt, polite and reasonably priced.  They always listened to what I needed and made it happen.  The year they changed over to automated software the reporting got even better.  I cannot remember a time when there was ever a mistake on the accounting.  They are also easy to schedule a meeting at the house and made it happen even if my rep was not available on that day.  Again, awesome team!</Text>

I've rented two times from AHP. Looking for properties on their site is great, I feel like the pictures give you a good idea of what the property looks like, and so do their walk through videos.

Both properties I've rented (I'm currently renting from them now) are well maintained. The respond quickly to maintenance requests. Their tenant portal makes it easy to submit a maintenance request and pay rent online.  Plus when I call someone actually answers the phone, which is better than the apartment complex I lived in that wasn't managed by them.

Moving in and out was pretty easy. We walked through the property for initial/final inspection. Moving in they give me a report with everything that was "wrong" with the property before I moved in. They also gave me a move in packet that detailed where to call for my utilities, cable in the area, and renters insurance.< /Review>

I can't say enough good things about American Heritage. Of all the places I have lived, they have been the best by far! I find it rare these days to get to talk to a real person on the phone. If I call during their business hours, an actual person picks up the phone! At previous places I lived I was lucky if I got a call back in a week. Here you can talk to someone every time you call. They also have the option to pay rent and request maintenance online…I love the convenience. If you are looking for a place to rent, definitely check them out!</Text>

American Heritage Properties has been my property manager for almost two years now. I find the organization to be very professional. They were able to find a good and reliable tenant quickly for a single family home we had just brought to market. They are extremely proactive with respect to maintenance issues and are able to locate reasonably priced vendors for repairs. I have been quite pleased with their performance as a real estate property manager.<//Review>

Finding a place to rent through American Heritage was simple and quick. The necessary paperwork was done online through Nicolle without a hitch. After moving in, I had some minor issues with the place which Marcia jumped right on and resolved. The crew at AH are  professional and efficient.  Working through a property management company affords you the luxury of accessing their vast resource support pool for all your maintenance needs and establishes a quality standard you would not get with a private party.  I highly recommend American Heritage Properties to anyone who is looking to relocate!!!</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>American Heritage Properties is really one of a kind. They went above and beyond to make every step of the way easy. This was my wife and I's first time looking for a condo. We had little to no experience, but American Heritage Properties made everything simple and straightforward. There are so many agencies out there these days and picking an agency to use can be very difficult, but I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt I would never use anybody else. After we got the keys they even left a present for us in our new home as a housewarming gift!  Do yourself a favor and trust them with what they do best. :)</Text>< Pics>

We rented a beautiful home from American Heritage properties in late November 2014 and continued to rent the house for one year.

There was a few issues with the house , (needed a new dishwasher had some plumbing issues )but each and every time American Heritage properties was very quick and responsive to handle each problem that arose with the house.

Unfortunately the owners had some kind of a medical issue and needed to move back into the house so unfortunately we were only able to stay for 11.5 months.

As you can imagine It's extremely difficult to try to find a house for rent in San Diego and right around the holidays there is just not very much available inventory so that makes looking for a home very stressful.

In 2010 we had a really bad experience when we we rented a house from an individual who was a real estate agent in chula vista  and her husband was a big shot DUI attorney , when we moved out they used a lot of intimidation and threat of a lawsuit in order to strong arm us to pay to repair this 25 year old house for things that we did not damage, like the 25 year old fence which blew over in the heavy rains and winds that happened in 2009 and 25 year old window screens which were damaged from 25 years in the sun not from us . )

So naturally we were thinking the worst but to our relief American Heritage and the owner accommodated us by giving us one free week and they give us back 100% of our deposit so we were very grateful and we would definitely recommend American Heritage properties to anybody looking to rent home from an honest company that really wants to try to do a good job to protect the homeowners investment as well as the interest of the tenant .

So we just want to say a big thank you to the whole team at  American Heritage Properties & Thank you Holly and Sandy for making this early move out turn out to be so good.</Text>

However, over three years they never demonstrated anything that made them "better" than any other property management company that collects rent.

If you do use them be prepared to find your own service professionals if any repairs or updates to your property are needed.

I'm not sure where AHP gets their vendors (or even if they bother vetting them) as their quotes were OUTRAGEOUS!

(One example was a bid of almost $1000 to repair TWO floor tiles!  Another overpriced quote was for  installing an oven and still another was for replacing a water heater.)

We ended up having to find our own vendors to service our property.  Luckily, thanks to the internet this wasn't too difficult despite being out-of-state.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1436286528982, 'text': "Hi Kevin,\nThank you for taking the time to write a review.

I've had a relationship with AHP as both a tenant and property owner for the past 4 years. Extremely professional and friendly, AHP provided my family with peace-of-mind as left our property to be professionally managed by their outstanding management teams. Expect quick responses either via email or phone, and best recommendations for nearly any situation. I would HIGHLY recommend AHP if you are looking for a property management company that knows all about customer service and satisfaction. Our expectations were exceeded from start to finish.<//Review>

<text>My family and I had been in the market for a new rental condo property for the better part of six months. About three months ago we stumbled across the AHP website and liked what we saw. During our search we visited three different properties over the course of two months. In mid-August we toured a property that was perfect for us. Great location, easy access to the freeway, wonderful school district. After our tour, my wife and I new this was the place for us. Having already been pre-approved the process was as simple as a phone call expressing our interest.

AHP is a professional organization and represents some of the best rental properties on the market. And believe you me, there are some scary places out there. We moved into our new home in early October and we are 100% satisfied. I give AHP my highest recommendation for anyone in the market for a new place to call home. There is a very small inventory of great housing properties out there, but AHP seems to represent a fair share of them.

With gratitude,
Satisfied Client/Tenant</text>< UserId.>

Moved back east for work and kept home in San Diego as a rental property. Had a family member managing the home for close to 20 years but when it finally became too much of a hassle for him I decided to turn to a property management company. Trying to decide which one took some research and was a challenge trying to do it from WashDC and having to make a relatively quick decision. I searched the web and read as many reviews as I could, narrowing down my choices after talking to receptionists and other office personnel over the phone (note: first impressions are important to me and are very telling, often reflecting leadership and management of a company).

I noticed that AHP was started by a retired Naval officer and was now run by his son. Being a Naval officer myself, it peaked my interest and seemed like a good place to start. I was impressed with everyone I spoke to on the phone and was impressed by the "can do" attitude of the individual who walked me thru the process, looked at the property and made recommendations. From the start I was impressed by the professionalism I observed from afar.

I have been with them for over two years now and am extremely pleased. They found wonderful tenants and have handled everything I've needed quickly and professionally. The chief property manager (and founder's son), Bill Ausen, is actively engaged and conscientious about making the company as good as it can be from what I have observed.

Their website states about their founder (John Ausen - Bill's father): "... founded American Heritage Properties in 1981, after retiring as a Navy officer with over 22 years of service. Recognizing that San Diego needed a highly streamlined and professional property management company, his military experience contributed to his organization and development of a company with the highest integrity and standards."

I can say from my experience it appears that he has met his goal.< /Text><resp>{'time': 1447786538146, 'text': 'Hi Mike,\nI just realized that I had never responded to your review.\n\nI sincerely appreciate you taking the time to share your experience in detail.\n\nIt is my hope that your satisfaction with American Heritage continues.\n\nThank you again,\nBill Ausen\nBroker'}< /resp><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Purchased a Cadillac Escalade yesterday. Drove maybe 1.5miles to a code saying “ low pressure oil, stop engine”. Immediately got off the freeway & ran into Jiffy Lube which was perfect timing because the car started hesitating to go. We literally only had the car from 2:32(pick up)-5:45p(returned).  They currently have the car & I’m nervous some fraud activity will occur to get the code to go away. Lady wouldn’t let me return since I didn’t sign a paper. She asked where I took the car & when I responded Jiffy Lube she said “that’s why” & laughed. The guy at Jiffy honestly didn’t charge us what he was suppose to charge us because he wasn’t able to fix the issue. The error message stayed up there. He said the bottom of the engine may need to be replaced.< /review>

Being a college student, my budget was tight however the staff worked with me to get the best deal possible. I definitely recommend shopping at this location because they provide great, reliable vehicles. I will most likely comeback to purchase another car in the future from them.</Text>< pictures>

This place made my life soo much easier. I was in and out of there in like less than an hour. My favorite part about the whole deal was their was no pressure. My biggest pet peeve is pressure. When I entered their office, ask about the car they handed me the keys and let me all the time I needed to check and make sure this is the car I want. I will defiantly be back here in a couple months to buy my daughters car. Oh yeh btw super friendly staff.
Thanks guys!<//Text>

Great help from the financing department getting me into the truck I deserve and great rates. I do recommend this dealership since my credit union trusts them as well as they are on their program. Quality trucks and great warranty options. Thanks Mike!

Drove 400 miles to pick up this f150,I know used vehicles are always taking a chance and I would kind of expect a few small things to pop up. Less than 14 hrs after pick up it broke down. Took immediately to mechanic and he found not just 1 or 2 but 9 codes deleted and  spliced wiring to the timing /cam phasers. They spliced the wiring and deleted codes to get it smogged illegally and sell and it ruined the timing in the engine, cost is estimated from 5-8 thousand to for a new engine replacement, they committed fraud. Pursuing criminal and civil charges.</review>

Worse service I have ever had with a dealership I got approved for 40k truck and this dealership ran my credit and kept blowing me off telling me they would call me back it took three days to get ahold of someone so they can try and get more down. The salesman there is the laziest salesman I’ve ever had. I went to a different dealership and got approved for a different car worth more for a better price. I told them they were about to loose a customer and they said they were doing fine and they could afford to loose customer because of how many customers they had even during a recession horrible dealership horrible staff highly recommend not to do business with these swindlers......<//Review>

<Text>I had a pleasant experience at this car dealership. I was really anxious about going to a used car dealership to buy a car but that wasn’t the case anymore after my experience with Mike and Ariana. Mike was really knowledgeable about cars and helped us showing several cars that meet our needs. Ariana got us a rate that was lower than what our bank gave us!! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone that’s looking for professionalism and quality service.

I bought a car December 23rd and parked it til I could get it checked at the dealership.  On December 26th I took it to the dealership only to find out it needs $7100 worth of repairs.  This is NOT AN HONEST DEALERSHIP , THEY DO NOT AIM FOR HONESTY and good customer service.  They will scam you and OVER CHARGE you for a broken vehicle.  DO NOT SHOP HERE .</Review>

< review>
I bought a 07 Nissian Armada in Dec from Auto Zoom. I was in a bind needing a reliable mode transportation for myself and kids. I am a single Mom doing the best I can do with what little I had and I feel preyed upon.  The owner was non negotiable but at that time I had no choice as I needed something NOW and settled. That was my fault I know this. I love my car now but it has cost me half what I paid for it in repairs and replacements in just 5 months. Only a day after purchasing it the rear window did not roll up or down. So that was replaced. The horn still does not work and that is going to be pricey as many parts have been replaced and the issue has yet to be resolved. I had to shell out $800 to have the struts and tie rods replaced. Not to mention there was 2 months until the registration was due so I shelled out $200 for that in the mist of the madness.
Again I really like my car. It is big, spacious and cozy for my small family but I feel like they sold me an unsafe vehicle seeing a quick sale of someone is in a rock and a hard place. I will not be returning as I do not feel that I was given a fair deal or honesty.<//review>

<Review>Car shopping is my weakness and I can’t say anything better about this dealership. Customer service is really important in any business and I usually leave if I don’t receive it in any business. I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for good customer service and quality cars.<//Review>< Resp>

They were fast, professional, non pressure, and nice though the whole process. The car I was looking at online was in kept in their warehouse they had inside. They also have a great selection of cars. Bobby went above and beyond getting the payments low as possible for me.</Review>

There are so many dealers in the same parking lot with no boundaries. The cars are somewhat mixed together and it is hard to find the staff for this company. I saw a particular car online and when I got there ....they couldn't find it. It was a nightmare. After test driving the car I asked about a particular issue I noticed. They explained to me exactly what it was. I asked if it would be fixed and they said they could fix it if I wanted to pay almost $2,000 more. Obviously I didn't buy it but went home and researched the part and cost of labor for the issue. It was less than $200. They we're trying to rip me off. I will never buy from them.< /Review><time>1522336815579</time><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>A very nice museum for its size.  It is small but they make very good use of the space that they have.  The docent was eager to talk about Hemet’s history and had a genuine interest in it.  He was very knowledgeable and he also grew up in this area.  There isn’t an admission fee but donations are appreciated.  There are exhibits about paleontology, the old train line and railroad, the Native Americans, the orchards and produce grown in the past, and old Hemet life.  It was a fun experience.  Expect to spend about a hour or so here.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO324t5TNB3DyzehOiSunX4OWS_Wf-rMQgJ4zAT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBkuDIRnTa0uhToSZw6XcOe8-adYHzKD7H_UwH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp-ELxR9HRRqDcUWnjpYoYD2Bh0cllGGkdkaPn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9G_0g4FzZeUe0LyLoj4tZ5PC1RWEL32S63PUB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiVDIbUZAPFzXNh8oBW8DuK9kSdIP8TYsrrarb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCjUDI-YRXX1Igz_BdB0r1UJIKVISLOnGbBwzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db6f4ff3447145:0x7a173b17c2d0e25</Gmap_id></record>

The Hemet Museum provided a panorama of local history. From fossils and ancient artifacts, to the development of its agriculture community, to the bulging metropolitan city it is today, the local museum presented a fascinating history. What a wonderful experience!< /Text>

Even though there were many visitors in the Hemet Museum, spacing was not an issue due to the size of the Hemet Museum.  All visitors did have masks on and social distancing was evident, But the problem thier is no trash bins in the surroundings.</text>

<Text>We just stopped through here on a whim. We looked up in Google to find things to do near us and we found this place. Little small museum with a lot of history tucked inside. If you're a fan of the old and Dusty is great place to come explore. We met a guy named Kevin who was the museum attendant and he was awesome. Very energetic very knowledgeable and you can tell he was passionate about history in this area. It is a donation recommended place and it's nice to leave a few bucks if you can to support the history conservation. Go check it out. @RoarksVentures passed through while camping in Idyllwild. Great little spot to spend a half our to an hour getting getting lost in history.< /Text>< Pictures>

Hemet  Muesum is in the Historical Hemet Depot  that was built in 1898..

<Text>Great selection of shoes but took a long time for anyone to offer us help. About 3-4 workers just chatting around not helping any customers and on a busy weekend. 💭

We walked over to someone and was a nice help. All they had left we’re display in son’s size so a bit a worn but we took a shot anyway. No offer of a discount, no biggie but would have been nice. 👟

My son wore for a few hours and felt uncomfortable so we took back to exchange for smaller size (6 days later as we live out of town) and very disappointed as Shoe Palace in Gilroy would not take them back. They looked the same as we bought them, nothing more than what the display gave us. 👎

So 4 stars for selection, 1 star for service = 2 stars which means they lost a lifelong customer. 🤷‍♂️< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I absolutely loved my visit here. Great variety/selection of brands & clothing. Staff was extremely helpful & courtious; wanted a jacket that was missing a button- the mgr went in the back & found a brand new 1. My Dad & I were very pleased. I'd definitely recommend this shoe store!<//Text>

Very disappointing. It is not well organized and the staff is very unfriendly and not interested in helping customers. We were looking for a particular brand and did an internet search. Shoe Palace showed that they carried this brand so we drove there. We couldn't find them and every staff member we asked told us to just look around which we did but couldn't find them. I finally asked for a manager who told me they don't carry that brand at the outlet store but at the San Jose store they would have it. That's understandable but the staff should know which brands they have in their store. It cost us an hour.<//text>

The store was organized and most workers were easy going and helpful. However, their manager was extremely rude and made me highly uncomfortable. He was very unhelpful and patronizing. Unfortunately I do not see myself returning to this store location because of him.<//review>

They are okay for two stars. They did good customer service for me, but I have to drop them to two stars for other customers that where unpleasant. (Never mind one star)< /Text>

Ordered my shoes online 10 days ago and never received a tracking number!! Called customer service and they told me that I would be receiving the link to track my shoes in 48 hours. Waited the 48 hours and never received the link, called again and she told me to wait another 48 hours. Gave her a hard time so she went to go check at the warehouse and she told me that the shoes were not available!!!! Did not apologize for the inconvenience just asked me if I wanted a refund. Terrible customer service at Morgan Hill, Ca<//Review>

DON'T SHOP HERE YOU MIGHT GET RIPPED OFF.  If I could rate it "NO STARS" I would.  First, when I asked for assistance the girl was coming over to help us and when another customer interrupted her as she was following me, she completely dropped us and started helping them.  When I interrupted her helping them, she said "oh, you had a question?" I told her "No, I needed assistance". When she finally got my husband the other shoe to the one on display (which had a sensor price tag of $59 sale price), we decided to get that pair.  We went to check out, she removed the sensor and price tag, the guy at the register rung us up and I realized the price was $18 more than expected.  I asked him what the price was and he said it was $69. When I told him it was priced tagged at $59, he tried to use the excuse that another customer must have put it there.  We told him it was one of their sensors with the price tag so they should sell it as advertised because that's fraud.  They are misleading their customers.  He told me "oh there's alot of shoes that are muspriced so they were cleaning them up" obviously they missed some shoes. When I asked him to verify with the girl how much they were priced at, he said "he could ask get but it wouldn't make a difference. The register was locked so there was nothing he could do", yet he had no problem deleting the transaction and continue to help others.  They are very mischevious, blame their mistakes on their customers, customer service was terrible. He should've apologized for their error and given me the price it was marked.
I took my son there a week later just so he could show me what he likes, but I wouldn't buy his shoes there.  I would rather buy them from a business with some integrity and great customer service, even if it's going to cost me a few bucks more.  Terrible, Terrible,  Terrible.......</text>

I have been a client a few times here at the Paul Mitchell School and I am seriously getting more impressed with my visits.  The supervisor Jacob, of which I cannot even begin to come up with the right words to express my most sincere graditute for this gentleman. He went far and beyond to make sure I was informed about everything and gave me the rest assurance I was in good hands, and I was .  I came walking out feeling like a supermodel.  All the students who worked on me were so eager to learn  and made me feel so comfortable.  Money and time well spent. And I will most definitely be back.<//review>

Absolutely LOVE the job they did on my hair! My stylist and her learning leader were fabulous.  I came in wanting something cute and short that would still look good with my curls, where I wouldn't have to blow dry it everyday. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new cut!</text>

Cosmetology school that provides salon services @ much reduced fair by PM students learning this field. Practicing on those enquiring services; teaching instructors monitor guiding over them. I like coming in & getting my hair: cut, colored, treated, toned, conditioned, corrected & styled  every now and again.< /review>

I came to get my hair done on March 31st, 2021. First of all, I completely understand that this is a school and a space for learning. So, it is at no fault of the students (more an issue with organization of the institution as a whole).

I am not going to write an entire sob story, but I would not recommend going here for any color (can't speak to the other services) unless you know the student that you trust. Unfortunately the lack of mentorship throughout the entire process led for me to leave the institute after sitting in a chair for 8 hours, paying over $120 and going to get it fixed the next day (today) at a salon for an additional $500 because it was so damaged.

Anyway, I know I walked in accepting the risk of working with students, but truly... I did not know it would be this shockingly bad.< /review>

The school is no longer like it was prior to covid. It's turned into one of the worst beauty schools with minimal professionalism,  value, quality or reliability.  While the customers are used as helpless Guinea pigs,  no one bothers to guide the students or give them any real help. The kids running the place, were pretty intimidating and aggressive.  The old paul Mitchell school is not the same</Review>

The hairstylists are always friendly and the price is unbeatable.  Give yourself between 1- 1 1/2 hours though, as they are all students and my hair is long and curly and it takes much longer than the professionals at Dry Bar... but as Dry Bar costs $49, Paul Mitchell is $12.  Plus.. the ones at Paul Mitchell also give a great hair wash!</review></record>

I came her with my mom and my sister for a haircut 💇🏻‍♀️ They told us that we had lice and that they could not complete the haircut until we had the live removed. We all freaked out and immediately headed to hair wizards where they told us we did not have lice. . . we had dandruff 🤦🏻‍♀️ It was the instructor who thought we had lice, which made it even worse; we were so furious that we went to Western Beauty Institute instead where, thank goodness, we had a much better experience.

In short, don’t waste your time here.< /Text>

I have been here coming for years with mixed success. Today I rushed here from work for a pre set appointment only to be told that there is no record of the appointment and my request can't be accommodated. I understand that this is a school but basically telling me that there's no accountability for  people who fail to properly book an appointment and refusing to give me an option to confirm an appointment is unacceptable. Nothing but attitude from the instructor who clearly felt the conversation was a waste of his time. Part of this training should be customer service, something he doesn't seem to know much about.<//review>

< Review>
So for the last couple months I have been coming to the Paul Mitchell Beauty School. Overall I’ve had a pretty good experience, I think many people forget that these men and women are students and still developing their practices and aren’t always going to know what to do. So patience and kindness is key. With that being said, I’ve been seeing an old friend’s sister here and she is amazing, unfortunately I haven’t had the best experiences with the instructors. They are often rude and difficult for my friend to pin down, there have been times when she has looked for just someone to help her and there hasn’t been anyone for a while and I myself haven’t seen them on the floor either. I am in the process of going platinum and unfortunately the Instructor who assisted last time asked the girls who were doing my hair not to use foils when lightening. Unfortunately I was wearing my late grandfather’s sweatshirt, and it’s been bleached for the lightening product as well as the top that was underneath it, I didn’t think that anything would happen to my clothes, had I, I would’ve worn something different so obviously it wasn’t expected, but it was certainly a let down because I would’ve expected someone to catch that. Things ran late that day, my friend had to go to work after the school closed, so the Sarah, the instructor, finished my hair. We finally got my hair to an 8-9, ready to get to a level 10 for the following session and my friend gave her instructions saying that she wanted a certain toner in my hair. Sarah ended up putting grey in and only told me it was grey while it was going in. I left with my hair just as dark as before, looking greenish (despite it being a grey toner, it looked green), and it was a patchy job. I’m not one to complain about something like this, but I’ve spent hundreds of dollars since September/October on my hair and now I’m questioning if I should continue with you guys, if I’m only going to have a fairly mediocre experience next time. :(<//Review>

If you are someone who is incredibly meticulous about your haircut, come here. If you’re someone like me, who just does a mandatory cut once a year, don’t go here. I was sat for about 2 1/2 hours for a cut that looks no different than when I could’ve done myself.  Everyone was kind and patient, customer service was great, I just wish the person cutting my hair knew how to move at a reasonable pace and cut more than five strands of hair at once<//text>

As good as it gets, I honestly never even dreamed about walk into this place to get a haircut, But after my wife told me i should, i gave it a try and i was amazed. The students there are probably more skilled than any of the barbers i went to before.  I was more then happy with my haircut and this place is now my new barber shop.</Text>

<review>This was my 4th and probably last time going to this place. The first two times I had the same hairstylist, and she was great. Third time she wasn’t the best, but I understood she was a student. But yesterday I left there in tears. The person cutting my hair did not know what she was doing. She even pulled up her iPad to look how how to part my hair for the haircut. I ended up changing my hairstyle because I could see she had zero clue about what she was doing and I was getting super nervous. When she pulled out her iPad to check how to do layers, I was like ok just leave it as is.  I said forget the layers. But the worst part was when she tried to style my hair and blow it dry. It turned super puffy. The teachers were nowhere to be found. At 8 pm the teacher came and said they were closing, but I could could come back tomorrow and she might fix it! She refused to even put any product in it to make it better. I understand that these are students that are learning, but they won’t be doing it on my hair. Too bad because I had such a great experience with the first stylist, but I can see that was probably just luck.<//review>< pics>

<Text>So I have been to the one in Sherman Oaks many times but honestly it is a hit or miss. I've had good experiences and less than desirable experiences. And unfortunately I think I'm just over the guessing game. This last time I went in for a cut and color, as I usually do, and it typically seems like the students don't have the stamina to do a long session like that. But because of this, I always keep my entire day open.
Unfortunately my hair was sacrificed this last visit.
I asked for the same color all over, no highlights, and she missed spots! Underneath and on the side of my head. Now when I put my hair in a pony tail you can see the missing spots (an ugly Orange color on my dark hair); I'm so embarrassed by it. And the hair cut was fine but not what I asked for! I asked to keep the same shape and instead they took too much off and it has really hard edges. And of course this was the time it had to cost more then usual. I paid a lot of money for a botched job and now I'm going to have to go pay even more money somewhere else to have this all fixed. I finally learned my lesson and don't think I'll be coming back. If you don't mind not knowing what will happen to your hair and just looking to pay less, go for it! But this last experience has ruined it for me.</Text>< resp>

<review>Honestly reading all of these reviews right now and they are all so funny. If you people want to get a good haircut, color or whatever THEN GO TO A PROFESSIONAL. You guys are all complaining about STUDENTS messing up your hair. Well news flash THEY ARE ALL LEARNING. You get what you pay for and you should all not blame PEOPLE IN TRAINING. Cut the bs. And pay extra to someone with experience instead of saying the school is horrible. You all sound ridiculous.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><user>113983180345999677603< /user><rate>4<//rate><date>1521652411095<//date><response>None<//response>< user_name>

I really want to give a 5.0 but I visited the salon with my daughter and her experience was not at all like mine.
1st off-The school needs someone to manage the front desk (figure out iPad mobile ck in or sonthing). We had appts for 5pm however the front desk bottle neck with 20 ppl in line did not allow us to ck in until 530. The senior hair stylists were doing their best to manage those of us concerned with our ck in issues. Paul Mitchell school HIRE A REAL front of shop manager.
2nd-Arrive WAY WAY early. The location is in a weird "Galleria" with like a few restaurants, movie theater, dsw, and 2 odd clothing stores. Many many vacant store fronts. Strange vibe.
Lastly, my stylist Taylor was supposed to be  level "2" and she was not and I am so satisfied that I am returning Thursday for some color.

My daughter got a level 2 stylist named Bailey.  She was very insecure, left color on her scalp and left lines of demarcation along hair line. She needs to learn to fake it and get some confidence. Poor thing. She was so nice, but my daughter will see Taylor moving fwd.

Renee was a fabulous instructor to Taylor while she was trimming my hair. Loved him. He is well respected by the students and other instructors. He is what's up.

Thanks!< /Text>

<text>I used to be a weekly client for a shampoo and blow out but stopped going for a variety of reasons. Emails of, "We miss you!!!!"  started arriving. Yesterday (January 29, 2014) I had an appointment at 11AM for a shampoo and blow out. I arrived at 10:55am and filled out the appropriate paperwork. I was told to "have a seat" on the couch and that someone would be with me "shortly."  This appointment to do my hair was in preparartion for a 1:30PM business luncheon in a restaurant very near by. At 11:10AM I began doing the crossword puzzle in the back of a PEOPLE magazine. At 11:20AM I finished this third grade challenge and looked to the desk to see if anyone remembered that I was sitting there. It appeared not. At 11:25AM with a knot in my gut I decided to leave. At 11:26AM a very nice student with auburn hair and a beautiful smile came to me and said that she was ready to do my hair. Too late.  I have electric rollers..........The MAIN PURPOSE of this review is to laud the elegant African American gentleman from New Jersey who answered the telephone when I called shortly after leaving to complain to the manager about my latest experience at this place. He validated my complaint and we both agreed that, "11AM means 'before 11:10AM' " and apologized for my less than stellar experience. He assured me that my next visit would make up for this one and to please not be discouraged again from returning. This man is a MAJOR ASSET to your company!!!  He should conduct a customer service workshop!!!  Will I chance another disappointing visit?? Maybe but I have electric rollers so......maybe not!!!! Either way, I am very grateful to this gentleman who knew what to say, how to say it and had a smile in his voice. Ideally, The Paul Mitchell School in Sherman Oaks treats him better than they treat random clients!!!! Thank you!!!!<//text>< Gmap_id>

Receptionists ARE MORONS! I used to get my hair done there in Sherman Oaks back in 2012, 2013. It was great, everyone was nice. Anytime, NOW and last year that I have called, the phone WORKERS are rude, hateful of their little 9.00 jobs and disrespectful. I went once and hated them up front so much I left..did not stay to get my hair done.
When i call, after a year or more, seeing if things have changed...they keep hanging up the phone.., many times it.s immediate you call back they put you on hold and AGAIN, keep hanging up. They.re so stupid they don.t even know how to work their phones.
They are also nasty with awful dispositions. I will be contacting the corporate office.</text>

<Text>I've only had excellant experiances at PM. Student #2313 is professional, takes her time to make sure she is getting it right and is concerned that she is doing what you want. The teachers are pleasant and take their time with the student to make sure you're getting the style you want. Remember, this is a school, and the time it takes to get your hair done will vary and at times take long, but for the price and quality of service you get, it's worth it.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Good thing I learned that early on, after I has a student who was simply afraid to cut my hair, and was just standing there....... been coming here for years. These people are STUDENTS,  so you are coming on your own risk. Always make sure to communicate to the teacher if you are having problems. And, make an appointment with Phase 2 as I already mentioned.  Those people are near their graduation, so they know what they are doing. Otherwise, unfortunately a lot of times it seems as no one cares there...like other reviews mentioned, front desk barely responds to the phones, or all the stuff is just too busy chatting with each other.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c297eb1eac214b:0xa250d72dea83a3b3< /Gmap_id><rate>4< /rate><user>113725281888852422735</user>< pics>

Do not ever go here! My bf went for a haircut today before our photoshoot and came back with his hair ruined!!! The hair cut was uneven and so was his hairline . it looked so bad. Ive never seen a worse hair cut. I told him to go back and have the girl who did it fix it or give him his money back. He refused as we were already late for our shoot. I will post a picture. Save yourself some time and money and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!</text>

If I could give my review 0 stars I would. I went in for a basic color and cut. I bought a groupon for $16, which basically covered the $40 color. I wanted to go a little lighter than my natural dark blonde. I was told that I would need to have the color stripped from my hair and then a color put back on. They are the pros, so I trusted them. They said that it's no longer a basic color and the price was going to be $67 for the color and cut and they have to charge me $10 for an extra bowl of color. I Thought it was a little pricey but okay whatever. 5 hours later, I ended up with the most brassiest yellow orange tinted hair. I was so embarrassed to leave. The student that did my hair was sooo excited and just wanting to take pictures of the finished product. she knew I didn't like it. She knew it looked bad, but she was trying to save face. When I went to pay it ended up costing even more. $76 more, because they had to use two bowls of color on my hair. I wish I could start the day over and not show up for my appointment. Waste of my time and a waste of my money. Never will I go back or recommend going there to anyone. Now I have to go pay more money to have my hair fixed and I get to live with this disgusting color on my head until they can get me in.<//text>

If I could give my review 0 stars I would. I went in for a basic color and cut. I bought a groupon for $16, which basically covered the $40 color. I wanted to go a little lighter than my natural dark blonde. I was told that I would need to have the color stripped from my hair and then a color put back on. They are the pros, so I trusted them. They said that it's no longer a basic color and the price was going to be $67 for the color and cut and they have to charge me $10 for an extra bowl of color. I Thought it was a little pricey but okay whatever. 5 hours later, I ended up with the most brassiest yellow orange tinted hair. I was so embarrassed to leave. The student that did my hair was sooo excited and just wanting to take pictures of the finished product. she knew I didn't like it. She knew it looked bad, but she was trying to save face. When I went to pay it ended up costing even more. $76 more, because they had to use two bowls of color on my hair. I wish I could start the day over and not show up for my appointment. Waste of my time and a waste of my money. Never will I go back or recommend going there to anyone. Now I have to go pay more money to have my hair fixed and I get to live with this disgusting color on my head until they can get me in.</Text>

Poor customer service. I showed up 30 mins early and one of the receptionists asked me to come back at the time of my appointment so I went to dsw to kill time. I came back and saw one was chatting with a friend and the other on the phone so I sat down, 25 mins later I asked the guy if I was going up any time soon and he said “you never checked in” then said he wondered why no one had called me. I had an uneven haircut but I wasn’t upset because I understand these are students and they are learning however a basic haircut took well over two hours. I didn’t have time to make sure it was even. After combing it out at home (1 hr later) I realized one side was longer than the other. I called and said it was ok but if they can just straighten it out for me but received horrible customer service once again. I feel like they don’t really know what to say even when your’re making things simple (said I would pay AGAIN for someone to even it out)  I’m considering just going to a hair salon and paying twice the price but less of a headache. Sorry but I can’t recommend this place to anyone. Somehow it comes out more expensive in the end.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Awesome school, great staff teaching the latest and greatest techniques! !! We wouldn't send our daughter any place else!

To: Kyle Sheehan and all who read the her post. 1) yes, it is pricey, but I know for a fact and we were specifically told this before enrollment that if you are driven, motivated, looking to advance they will be right by your side, however if you're there simply to get your license, then that's where they'll "meet" you. So that's up to the student to decide. Also, what are your goals? There are many advantages by attending this school, including some amazing assistance with job placement,  such as at studios, actors, and very nice salons. They also DO IN FACT supply you with all of their professional supplies and products in a traveling case on your very 1st day, that includes, hair products ie, blow dryer, flat iron, curling iron, sprays, etc,  as well as all the spa supplies, makeup,  etc. The tuition also includes all of the doll heads, and the 2 books that you will need, 1 for color the other is for towards the end when they teach you all about how to pay taxes. There are no other books required because on the 1st day they give you a brand new iPad to keep with all the apps and software u will need, and this too is included in your tuition. We did plenty of research, we had 3 meetings before commiting, with all that said, Paul Mitchell is a great school. Oh and as far as the location, it's wonderful that's it's right off the freeway,  who wants to drive all through the valley if you don't have to. That's my 2 cents!</Text>< pics>

I was not satisfied with the services. I went for a coloring. The guy who did my hair, the teacher had him use 40 developer and I later found out their not suppose to use 40 developer. I complained about the services and products they used. They still wanted to pay $10 per bowl for bleach or toner which I don't think is right.<//text>

<Review>I still remember when Ulta first came to California. It was such a huge deal! I had been addicted to Sephora back then, and I never walked out without dropping $200, so I had to go cold turkey. Sephora was my personal crack den. Anyway, Ulta is carries drug store makeup so it's not so hard on my wallet, plus they have some serious sales. It's huge and clean and the employees are friendly (though I've seen some scary corporate stories on Reddit and Tiktok). If you are going to shop at Ulta, shop in the store, because they resell returns. No, they are not supposed to do that, but if you are buying online, you can't inspect your items like you can in the store. Anyway, if I'm near an Ulta, there is no way I'm not going inside just to see what is new. P.S. the Sephora near me NOW HAS A LOT OF THE ORDINARY!!! YAYYY< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The overall experience is average like any other Ulta location - however, I called about a specific product line and was placed on a super long hold. When I finally got someone to look into store availability for the line, she said that they didn't carry it at this location. The next day, I go in to buy a new brush and lo and behold, they have the entire line in their skincare section. Just seems like they're not all together here.</Review>

They were out of some of their promotional items, but she made sure I left happy. She was very patient and kind as well as very knowledgeable about the store and product.<//text>< Pictures>

Love ULTA but I would rather drive to the Irvine store than come to this one. It's ALWAYS under stocked, empty shelves, the nail polish section is laughable on hope bare it is and the employees see you standing there & are too busy doing nothing to ask if you need assistance????👎< /Text>

<review>After having a pretty bad experience at the Whittier location, I almost didn't bother coming to the La Habra location. Luckily my husband drove me here anyway. Super grateful he did. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and helped even though they were extremely busy. I didn't get the young lady's name. I think she may have been the manager. I needed to be color matched and she walked me straight to Amy who took care of me. I don't wear too much makeup. Amy didn't make me feel dumb when I asked about concealer or anything else. She was super helpful and positive and educated me on what to do and what to buy. No salesy pitches, nothing. Just pure honest feedback and suggestions. Thank You ladies for turning my experience around! You have a lifer here!!! HUGS!!!

Today's visit was very lackluster today's date is the 13th of July and the time is 9 o'clock I probably got in here like at 8 so from 8 to 9 I literally walked around the store looking for a foundation and a primer. Not once was I was approached by  anybody in the store to ask if I needed any help,not one time I saw 1 makeup artists on the floor and I think the other lady was a hair lady. Neither one said a word to me it totally floored me at the end of the day I don't know what I'm doing with makeup so I didn't make an Impulse buy, just tested some items, bought something little and called it a day.< /Review>

Was very frustrated trying to return an item.  I wanted my money back but was told since I was only one day pass the 60 days return policy they could only give me store credit.  They were not willing to budge.  Not happy and won't go back.  😒<//text>

I went to get my favorite foundation in my shade and could not find it, so I asked a person for help and she said she had to go to the back to look for it so I waited 5-10 minutes . Then I'm assuming the "manager" of the store comes up and tells me she is sending another person to look for it, she then tells me she has not seen my shade of foundation in months. Really you haven't seen this popular brand of foundation in my shade in months? I don't recommend coming to this location, it seems like they never have anything in stock.< /review>

Poor customer service. Had a hair appointment, was pretty much ignored as I waited; first time at the salon. Rude stylist came out and said it would be another 35 minutes e en though I was on time. No eye contact, no apology.< /review>

<Review>Walked in place was crowded. Started looking for sales assistant our eyes locked and it was all over. Explained to Ronald
.. like McDonald... what i was contemplating... he told me what a bad choice i was making ... and pointed me in the right direction... ended uo with some Mally foundation and primer/pore minimizer. So far so good. Excellent customer service.< /Review><time>1512809104128<//time>< user_name>

< review>
I'm extremely disappointed after coming to this ulta location this morning having gotten a greeting and no further assistance. Today I needed help finding a suitable foundation for my skin which is rather difficult alone and with no knowledge on what's good and not so good. We saw a few employees none of which asked to see how we were doing or any other costumers were doing besides one at the brow bar. I over heard another costumer asking for service which was responded with "What do you need?" And later, "We don't sell those items like that anymore." Therefore concluded her costumer service. I ultimately decided to leave and will look for better service at a different location or maybe I'll just return to Sephora. Shouldn't employees push sales?< /review>

<Text>Ulta, your return policy will drive customers away to Sephora. I came to return a $4 shampoo from December 2016 with the receipt; the item was nearly new. The cashier and manager refused to give me a refund and wanted to give me the "lowest price," which was a couple cents which is ridiculous. Don't drive customers away over $4. I've returned products over 60 days with and without the receipt recently even after your return policy changed and they accepted them for full credit; I'm afraid to shop at ulta now because of the inconsistent return policy.< /Text>< pictures>

Staff are very honest and helpful. Emphasis on honest which is why I switched from Sephora. If they can’t answer my question they don’t just guess and product push they find someone that can answer me better. If they see me buying something I don’t need for example I got an it cosmetics cc cream (which doubles as a concealer, foundation, moisturizer and spf) the sales woman saw I was also debating on getting a concealer from the same line and informed me the cc cream I was already buying was also concealer so I didn’t waste the money on it.  I ended up buying a nice lip stain as well with the extra money by tarte and I had another experience when I couldn’t decide on a foundation and a employee gave me samples of a couple to try at home before I decided so I could see which worked better with my skin type throughout the day. I was ready to buy one I was unsure of but she earned a return customer and made the store more money in the long run that way she was the one that initially got me hooked on ulta. Putting the customer before her own commission. That’s something I really admire about this particular ulta. Honesty</Review>

Love Ulta but I have noticed lately they are missing a lot of product. Inventory has been lacking.</text>

< review>
So here's the reason why I 1 starred this Ulta in particular. I have been to Beverly Hills, The Grove, High end malls around California and NEVER and I mean EVER have I felt as uncomfortable as I have when I came here. I am hispanic, don't look it but I am. For some odd reason when I walked in I felt like 2 of the workers immediately started profiling me. A few minutes later I saw the 2 speaking to one another, the next minute one of the women came next to me and loudly asked on her headset "Are the police coming?". Now I've worked as loss prevention and I know the basic procedures for deterring theft. These 2 women were seriously racial profiling me and I feel appauled. I love bringing my mother and wife Ulta, never have I run across such an issue anywhere that I've been. I'm sorry ulta but whoever trained or is managing this ulta needs to be checked. Seriously sad that my mother still went and purchased something from this store, never will I come here again. Hope no one else feels the same discrimination that I felt, Amazing...<//review>

I called this place 7 times to see if they carry a certain brand.  The fist 3 times I was put on hold for 10 minutes while they "looked" for the product but was disconnected every time.  I then called 3 more times and it went to voicemail.  The last time I called I finally got through to someone.  The person acted like she had know idea what I was talking about when I exploded the 6 previous calls.<//text>

Store was busy, which was to be expected as they opened up moments before I arrived.  I was disappointed they offered a special, several tags advertising it but had NONE. Don't post for items you don't have available.  Ulta is notorious for this though<//review>

<Review>I've been here a bunch of times and each time has been awesome. Everyone is nice and the place is clean. If you get a foot massage you sit on a leather chair that reclines. It is a little bit cold in there but they give you a light blanket to cover yourself.  There are no frills so if you are looking for luxury this is not the spot for you.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJnBhW7-WGlVt1lSkHJav2c4KGs-kadwwh1S9h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrFAKXhuxIwPy4aQAFq6w7AawmtxUkWiXYVNwR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Great experience from the point I called to make the appointment until I paid and left. The staff were very kind and the massage was exactly what I needed. All the pain in my feet and legs is gone and the head and face reflexology was a delight. Will be returning soon with any friends or family I can talk into it. Best price I've found for service this great. ☺</Text>

My mom and I were down at the farmers market and stopped by here after for what we thought would be a quick foot massage. I was impressed as it was a lot more than expected. They put us in big comfy chairs and actually respectfully massaged our entire body. They know TuiNa massage techniques which is a traditional Chinese massage in which I’m trained. The feet soaking with the head massage was delightful. Felt great when we left! 🤗🙏 cash Only and don’t forget to include the tip!< /Review>

I did a 90-minute foot body combo. It was good, but not wonderful. the language barrier with the massage therapist made it difficult to be specific during the massage. Also, many of his methods seemed a bit random and amateur. There was a lot of muscle pinching.

Customer service was good and the environment is nice inside this space. Car very likely to be broken into if parked on the street. Don't leave anything visible.< /Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Called for a last minute reservation and they were able to squeeze me in.  $50 for a 75 minute massage.  45 minute foot massage, and a 30 minute back massage.  The first part of the massage is in an open area.  It's odd to me that you get up go into another room to finish off your back.  I usually know what I'm expecting at these kind of massage places.  Essentially, you get what you pay for.  Most massage places like this are $30-$40 for a 1 hour massage.  15 minutes more for $10-20 more was not worth it for me.  Although their customer service was fine, the actual massage itself was awful.  I had so much pain the next day.  My back was completely bruised up.  I had tears running down my eyes during the massage.  I had to tell him several times please do it softer.  The first half of the massage they did my feet, legs, head and arms.  That part of the massage was fine.  The 2nd half of the massage you go into another room and take your clothes off to get your back done.  It was pure agony and pain.  I kept looking at the clock waiting for it to be over.  Unfortunately I will not return.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>I went for my first ever massage and it was really pleasant. the massage therapist was able to locate the problematic areas very effectively. I was ready to fall asleep by the time she was done. The front desk receptionist was extremely pleasant and helpful. overall my experience was very nice, the atmosphere was calm and the massage therapist knew her stuff. definitely planning to go again when I get the chance.
ps: I may have just missed it on their website, but the place is cash only and they were kind enough to let me wait until after my appointment to go get cash.</text>< pics>

They also had $45 for just back. There is nothing private about this space as many of the massages are done in one large room. But if you aren't looking for the spa experience and just want a good rub down, this place is the best for the right price.</review><date>1514411799635< /date>< gmap_id>

I should have known better! *In brief: They  literally injured my spine. *Company response: We'll give you a few Accupuncture visits to help....I went for them, had some minor very temporary relief for maybe 20 minutes after each, then hurt again. *Details: I've had Chinese massages for years, and usually go to another place in Oakland.  But, sometimes for variety, I try other places.  Here at Angel Feet, the practioner used deep and somewhat painful pressure.  She said, don't worry about it, that it's healthy long-term, rather than just comfortable short-term.  So, since I'm a believer in the long-term benefits of a good massage, combined with the seeming credibly of being co-located in an Accupuncture office, I "trusted" her.  In hindsight, her move that caused my spine injury was when, I was on my stomach, she "with strength" lifted my leg, high & hard above my back.  I again said, that it hurt a lot..but she reminded me that it is supposed to.  Well, after leaving, approximately 2 hours later I was still in pain, which then continued to get worse.  The next morning, I had trouble getting out of bed.  When I stood up for any length of time, it hurt more.  This pain continued for months.</review>

My fiance and I always come get a massage and enjoy it every time. All the time we are there our favorite guys that we request is always gone🤦. It's very upsetting but the new guys that are there we always try but this last time we went in two weeks ago, Bruce and Michael helped us. Bruce was very good but as for Michael, my fiance said he was gone 70% of the time. He sat on the arm rest the times he so call massaged her, also he was pooting around(that's disgusting and rude). He just put pressure on her body instead of massaging. Lastly, we always give our massagers a great tip and it upset me because we gave him 5 dollars as a tip and he questioned it? First of all I did not need to give you anything but I did out of kindness. If anyone knows where Tom and Billy went, it would be nice because they we're very generous.</Text>

The prices are what brings me back, they do a $35hr. leg n foot massage thats really more than just the feet. They also offer $40 hr. back massage as well, I usually do both. Beware tho you really have to speak up about the pressure they apply as its easy to get beat up here otherwise. So tell them soft or medium and make sure to speak up if its too hard, they tend to rub on the hard side.
Also my tip is to call ahead for a reservation (big plus if you speak an asian language) and ask them where to park as they offer a discount if you park in the parking lot they work with.< /Text>

<Text>It's is a relaxing environment where you can get a massage and reflexology treatment for 35 bucks an hour.  The start wit a hot foot soak and pressure point facial massage.then they do your feet ,arms,neck and shoulders
.most of the time you need an appointment but you can get walk in treatment sometimes.  The old men are the best reflexoloigists ,if it is therapy you need. The room is quiet and relaxing.  I almost always fall asleep. It is a great way to beat traffic while treating yourself to a relaxing evening. Then it is nice to take a walk through China town and have a bite to eat or do some grocery shopping.  On Friday there is a farmers market on 9th and Broadway.  There are many authentic Asian restaurants quite close . Great dim sum may be had. On the other side of Broadway near 9th and Washington can be found some tap rooms and some great eating in the Swan market complex. That market offers a butcher shop with a truly epic selection of brats and sasauges.  The fish market has some deals too.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1516221000221, 'text': "Matthew, thank you! Providing our guests with a relaxing massage is what we do best.

Although the price is relatively low, the massage was rushed and not particularly good.< /Review>

Good German beer selection. The food is tasty but I wouldn’t go there strictly for the food. Nice spot to drink and get snacks. Great ordering system< /Review>

<Text>Last Saturday I came here for the second time and it was the proof/reaffirmation that it is a good place to eat. (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).

Its dining area is cozy, spacious, and perfect for relaxing, enjoying your food, and the street view. I had the famous Turkish Breakfast (light, varied, and full of flavors that combined are very enjoyable), my friend ordered something "safe" and something traditional: traditional beef burger & gyro pita. He was very happy with both options (meat with good seasoning/taste and not greasy) and of course a traditional beer (he was really happy with the combination of food and beer).

The staff is friendly and always looking if you need something, and ready to clean/disinfect the areas that are vacated to prepare them for the next people.

Its menu is very varied and extensive, which will give you the opportunity to go more than once and enjoy all its options (and its desserts!)

Bonus point: the location, it gives you the opportunity to walk -after eating (and not feeling so guilty about the dessert you ordered) through the whole Castro street and enjoy the atmosphere of "the streets closed to cars".< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTRZC_xAh0sxkGyvGT8IpyuO3Qf9rVarCKyC2d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg1q_BZECCnU7zYs7566V9yM6SUxPNi6NjgifW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMu_ilxld1WARPHfNt5ZDU9uFRWg3NrZdXP293=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP73BAGoAu2NrLdkKe29Apam5pJi7_T-rso4zwc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< user_name>

This place has a ton of outdoor seating and you get served relatively quickly I really enjoyed that they also had Exploding Kittens which I played before my food came. The pita was super flakey and tasty and the tomato flavor was really great and savory so the whole Turkish breakfast dish stood out a lot. Would come again.< /review>< pics>

I'd give this 3.5 stars, but round up to 4.

This is a really cute, family owned, small Turkish spot. They have all kinds of traditional pastries and meals. I got the Turkish breakfast, which looked incredible. It looked a bit better than it tasted, and it was pricy for what it was (sliced tomato, cucumber, salami, and an egg) but the bread was fresh baked and food was satisfying.

I'd probably try it again.< /Review>

Now that it's getting cooler, you can order from a wide variety of hot drinks. Don't forget to save room for their homemade desserts.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Great outdoor dining space!

Scan a QR code to get to the online menu. Order and pay online using Toast.

Food gets brought out fairly quickly, everything tasted freshly made. Warm pretzel with sweet mustard was devoured.

Shakshuka was a nice blend of onions, tomatoes, peppers, with 2 poached eggs and Turkish bread on the side - delicious!

Chicken sandwiches, bratwurst, etc, were all decent. Every dish comes with fries so be prepared for lots of fries!

As it's getting cooler, would be nice to have some outdoor space heaters too.<//review><Time>1605399888206</Time></record>

Think drunk college meal with what was left of the bread and the mushrooms and broccoli you found in the bin but had forgot about. Of course you are almost out of milk, so not so creamy, but the fact you had two slices of bread left and beer made up for it. Why you would box that experience up and sell it downtown in you greek/german eatery who knows! But kudos for the effort, and what kind of fool orders fettuccine alfredo from such a place anyhow...</review>< user_id>

I got the Dönnerkebab pita sandwich from the beerhaus menu. The meat, lettuce and other vegetables were good but the pita was cold, dry, and falling apart. A warm, soft pita would have made it so much better. The included fries were very good.< /text>

<Text>I want to love it, but I just can’t.

Pro: great location, lovely outdoor seating area, friendly staff

Con: food. And drink. I left half of my lukewarm-on-arrival scramble on the plate because the cheese tasted moldy.
I left half of the tea in the cup because the water tastes bad and they don’t appear to filter it.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Out-of-towner here. I come to this place just about every time I wind up in Mountain View. It's consistently good, and just about the only good breakfast option (is anything else on Castro St even open before 10?). Food, service, atmosphere is great. Tons of seating. The baklava is unbelievably good (moist but not soggy, crispy but not stale).< /Review><user_name>Martin Bonica< /user_name>< resp>

Turkish restaurant with strange greek labeling. The Turkish coffee was quite good. The baklava had a strange taste, not what I am used to from Turkish places in Europe.<//Review>

This is a surprisingly hidden gem in downtown. Olympus is just next to the train station, with plenty of outdoor seating, and some inside. The menu is fresh, and feels well made from what I've tried. Don't skip, just walk in, and order one of the all day brrakfast items and a double espresso. Then take a seat and enjoy the scenery.<//text>

<Text>This man was just trying to buy a coffee — he wasn’t being overly disorderly. The owner, after charging him for the coffee, then called the police to remove the man for no apparent reason. I felt that this situation was inflated to be more than it was; the owner did not have to treat this man in this way just because of the way he looked and dressed. I was deeply saddened by this. The owner did not have to escalate the situation and mistreat the man in this way. Now the man is handcuffed in a police car. I refuse to come to this restaurant again. This cafe is called Olympus cafe in Mountain View. This post is about the unkind of the owner, he can just asked the man to leave instead of called the police and charged him for the coffee. The man just wanted a coffee and he paid as well. I always believe that we should be kind to people who are less fortunate than us. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. (btw, if you are going to this coffee shop and forget to wear a face mask, they will call the cops. )</Text>< pics>

{'time': 1600093572388, 'text': 'Dear miss Joanne,\n\nI believe there has been a misunderstanding about what happened to the man that was at my establishment. First, I want to make it clear we did not call the   cops. A man came into my business without a face covering, I told him he must wait outside, but still took his coffee order. Then all of a sudden the cops came. They told me that this man was causing a disturbance at another establishment.\nWe treat all of our patrons with the utmost respect.\nWe have been in business for many years and have a good client tell.\n\nWe also wish that you talked to the police at the time. But you are welcome to contact police department to find out about who called the police. Because we have already talked police department. They are expecting your call.\n\nThan will do announcements to the public together.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThis is our second post,  since we since we do not hear from you,\n\nHello\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to clear up a misunderstanding. Attached to this message is the police report regarding the situation. Please take time to review the report so that we can resolve this misunderstanding.\n\nAs noted in the report, the customer was making a problem in the downtown area before he came in to Olympus and showing alcoholic symptoms which has caught the police’s attention and resulted in his arrest. As a restaurant we have no association with the arrest.\n\nWe simply ask that you remove all false accusations from our review page promptly. We do not tolerate racism or the mistreatment of customers at Olympus.\n\nWe tried the post police report here, but google do not accept picture posting here\nsend us a your email than will forward you full police report.\n\nI hope we can resolve this issue smoothly.'}</Response>

The food here is not the best you'll ever eat, but the atmosphere is nice and it's pretty fun to sit outside with a glass of beer during these crazy covid times. My wife insists you should try the schnitzel at night.</Text>

Good food, tables far from each other and mostly not directly where people walk (unlike other restaurants on Castro where people walk next to most tables).< /Review>

The food sucks, very pricey and bad hygiene. We spent $70 for two scrambled eggs (no sides at all) and a chicken pita. Every time we went to the restroom, the old man (i guess he is the owner) would stare at you like you were an outsider. it was a very uncomfortable feeling. I will not go again.</Text>

One of the waiters was unbelievably rude to me.  I ordered the Dolmades, which, as you can see from the picture I took, INCLUDES PITA.  I received a sad little plate with 4 dolmas and no pita, so I went up to the counter to ask for pita.  A waiter who was just standing around came over to rudely tell me my dish doesn't come with pita.  I pointed to the sign and he just said "well you're not getting pita.  The sign says pita but your dish doesn't come with any."  I asked for a manager and he just said I wasn't getting any pita because he said the dish doesn't come with any.  The cashier said that of course the dish comes with pita... but the waiter continued to argue with me, and instead of bringing me the missing component of my order, slammed plates and completely ignored me so someone else had to bring it to me.  Watch out for the tall man with the beard.  He's rude, dismissive, and tries to cheat you out of things you already paid for.</Text>

<Text>We really enjoy the crepes here. They have nice outside seating and the food usually arrives quickly.

Also, you should try their creme-brulee cheese cake.< /Text>< pictures>

The goat cheese salad is a pure delight. They also have great looking desserts - I do not have a sweet tooth so I do not partake, but I enjoy the eye candy of their display. Also great Turkish tea.< /Review>

< Review>
Olympus had the worst restaurant service and food we have ever had at any restaurant anywhere. First off it took 25 minutes for us to get our food. Then my wife's salad was rotting and she had to ask for new salad that took an additional eight minutes to get and it was slightly rotten too. My wife had no salad dressing for her salad. I ordered the gyro plate and was given no pita bread with my meal. I had to ask and wait for a tiny amount of pita bread. Then when I asked the waiter for more pita bread it never came. Both our meals tasted cheap and gross. On top of that the food was very expensive. I could go on and on. Avoid this restuarant. Terrible place.</Review>

Good food in mountain view. Right next to the train station and the parking lot. I ordered from the Turkish breakfast menu and it was delicious. They need to update their website because the menu prices in the store are at least $2 higher on average than what is listed online. Don't forget to try the desserts!!< /text>

<review>Good ambience, friendly (enough) staff and omelette in point! Gyro sandwich was a bit bland but loved the salad dressing. Great variety of desserts e.g. baklava, opera cake, cheese cakes e.g. not too loud, and self seating type of place. On the cheaper side considering Castro street price range with decent portion!<//review>< Pics>

Not the greatest of cafes I've been to. Great location, decent food, and pretty good ambiance. Turkish coffee is "different", so maybe worth a try. Besides that, the scrambled eggs and other typical breakfast dishes are nothing but ordinary.<//text>

<text>I admire this place! They give fantastic dishes, their menu is decent, The chief cook in that place is very trained, I enjoy a lot tasting all their food. The dishes are consistently tasty, the attitude towards the customers  is efficient. I visit often this restaurant and I not even once was discontended. I recommend it to all my friends.< /text>< name>

Great atmosphere and friendly staff. They have wifi which is great!

I had ordered decaf and they didn't have any after they charged my order. I was about to be a little upset but they were friendly and helpful in finding a replacement.

I didn't have the food, so I can't review that. But the coffee was delicious and fast! The food did smell amazing! I got there at the right time because it does get busy for the morning work crowd :-)< /Review>

Good place. Has limited indoor seating but a lot of outdoor seating to make up for it.. has a wide variety of dishes on the menu. Recommend ordering the Turkish dishes, the pasta wasn’t really good. Falafels were awesome though. Service was relatively quick. Definitely a place to check out if you are on Castro!< /review>

< Review>
Greek name and lettering for a Turkish place? While that's a bit deceiving, I nevertheless wanted to give it a try, too, after passing by so often. OK getting over that false advertising: I love good Turkish food too, but this was a tasteless, Americanized thing. Lamb was dry, lettuce poured from a bag, disappointed. Neighboring other Turkish restaurants (with Greek names, too) are excellent, will stick to them for good Turkish food. Waitress and music were pleasant, though.< /Review>

Turkish restaurant with strange greek labeling. The Turkish coffee was quite good. The baklava had a strange taste, not what I am used to from Turkish places in Europe.<//review>

Visited the place for lunch as it is close to the station, before heading out to the hotel. Ordered Cobb salad and pita with gyro. The salad was fresh, tasty and healthy. The gyro was one of the best we've had outside Greece. There was a slight wait as it was the rush hour but it was worth it. The service was okay.< /text>

The place is OK but the food was not that amazing. There are many tables, outdoor seating as well, and some good looking desserts that I haven't tried myself. A few beers on tap, not that many. Happy hours with $5 for any beer from the tap.<//Text>

Prices online do not reflect the prices actually at the restaurant. I bought a burger and it was very small. Far smaller than any burger at that price point. Other people with me got some good looking gyros and stuff, but I think the overall consensus was dissatisfied. Biggest kick was that we chose it for it's relatively cheap prices from online and they were a straight up lie.< /Review>

I've been going there for years and see the service declining. The last time around, the girl who took my order misplaced/lost it and after waiting for over 45 mins, we realize our order has not been processed. The staff were cold and apathetic, did not apologize, and we left hungry after requesting a refund. I would have liked to re-order, but going by their attitude, felt it was better to go elsewhere. If you choose to eat there, sit outdoors enjoy the view, and always ask for a copy of your receipt to prove that you did order and to ensure you get the items you paid for. I will not be going back.< /Text>

A great spot for brunch for small and large groups alike. I've been to Olympus many times and have yet to find something on the menu that isn't wonderful - waffles, omelettes, pastries - it's all really good! And definitely get the hash browns.</Text>

<text>They recently "upgraded" their outdoor seating from European cafe patio to American gastropub deck style. It fits more people and seems more polished but now kind of loses what made this place unique.

This is a perfect place for enjoying breakfast with great outdoor seating. We are going there pretty often. They offer a great selection on breakfast like American, Turkish as well as good lunch options.
You also have to try their original mint tea - it’s awesome. And don’t forget to take one of the delicious Baklava desserts - they are unbelievable!
Nice staff as well.< /text>

This is one of the many bakeries and coffee shops in downtown Mountain View but what make this place special are their pastries like baklava.  Prices are comparable to other bakeries.  People stay here for hours here over their coffee, pastries and tablets and laptops. They also serve lunch and dinner.<//text>

Good place to hang out after work, offers happy hour pricing on draft beers with a pretty good selection of the staples. Regular beer prices very competitive, nice outdoor beergarten style seating area. Full food and dessert menu available. Definitely Recommend< /review>

Went to this place as it was somewhat busy, and I ordered the falafel plate. The people there were very nice, and there was water at the side. The seating was either in or outdoor, and we chose a spot outside looking out towards the train tracks. The falafel was great, and the hummus and pita was good too. I would recommend this to anyone who would want Mediterranean food, and they even have a bakery with lots of baked goods.</Text>

Prices are comparable to other bakeries.  People stay here for hours here over their coffee, pastries and tablets and laptops.

Rly good lamb gyro
Fries look good & crispy (unlike soggy ones @ most greek spots)
Banana bread very good(a little too sugary). The blueberry muffin could also use some work. A trend seems to be forming with the American baked goods.

Good ambiance
Nice outdoor seating
Fast service< /Text>

Slow service is my only complaint. Perhaps their kitchen is too small for all the business they have. They serve a nice combination of American food and Turkish food. The coffee is excellent. You can sit inside or outside on the patio where dogs are allowed.</review>

<Review>I enjoyed my chicken kabob dinner.  The food was tasty and pleasing to the eye as well.  My companion shared a bit of falafel with me,  also well plated but a bit bland.

The baked goods looked fantastic but I did not partake.

Service was efficient.   They have lots of outdoor seating that was not crowded.  It also is away from the pedestrian crowds on the sidewalk.

Parking is near impossible.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Great Turkish/Greek place. One orders food at the front and they bring it to you according to your number. Sitting outside is absolutely gorgeous.

I got a portabella panini, and it was perfectly grilled; the side salad and dressing were really tasty as well. Mom had a strawberry waffle and based on her reactions I would say it was also impeccably done.<//Review>< Pics>

Pass this place all the time but never stop.  We were going to another cafe this morning but found it was closed on Mondays.  Stopped here instead and it was a great surprise!  Ordered a chai latte and the greek yogurt with granola.  Super yummy.<//text>

Food was good and there was little to no wait. On the way out i bought some pasteries for my mom. One was their Tres Leches cake. She told me "i give them a 10...and that's out of 5! Best i've ever had".<//text>

Very friendly staff is happy to guide you through the extensive menu. Order at the counter; food will be brought to your table. This is a great place to dine outside on a fine day. Ample portions. Reasonable prices. I’ve never had room for anything from the gorgeous pastry case, but coffee and baklava is at the top of my list for my next visit.</Text>< Pics>

Ordered a gyro, spanikopita, and the British burger. All were quite good and the portions were fairly generous. Worst parts were that the order got slightly messed up (put pickles on the burger despite no pickles request) and the free water dispenser looked empty, encouraging me to buy a sugary drink instead. Overall, still a good place and I'll definitely consider coming back here, especially for the relatively low prices.< /text>

I've been coming to this place over the last year. Had food here at least 20 times.

Service and food quality was already not great, but it has now gotten to ridiculous levels, so have to give this 1 star.
Today, I found a strange piece of meat (that looked like ham) in a chicken omelette I ordered. I went to the waiting staff to note that, and the only reaction I got was: "Are you sure you didn't order something other than a chicken omelette?", followed by them taking my plate and not saying a single word. Great service guys!

Also: some simple sides (like gozleme, Turkish pancakes) have multiplied 2x in price... with no clear justification.< /review><date>1540668788934< /date></record>

<Text>If you like authentic Turkish breakfast, meal, coffee, or dessert Olympus can be your place. I always enjoy their nice salads too. The environment is also good for meetings and working on a laptop or paper. Kids can also enjoy the entree's and desserts alike.<//Text><Time>1524375816554< /Time><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6< /gmapID>< Response>

Average Greek food. This is not so much authentic Greek food but more of a mix between Greek, Turkish and American food. Had high hopes yet food tasted quite bland. For better Greek food look elsewhere. While the food was okay, desserts we're excellent!< /Text>

Visiting from Michigan, found Olympus on Google Maps, arrived and it is amazing! Fresh squeezed orange juice, fantastic coffee, pastries are insane, and I came for breakfast and it was great! I'm a huge breakfast guy and I would definitely come back here! Not to mention the outside seating is the perfect place to get a morning coffee and enjoy the Mountain View Weather.<//Review>

Ok food and atmosphere. Not especially flavorful or tasty, but definitely not bad. Their Turkish pastries are my favorite items.<//Text>

Visited for dinner and breakfast on two separate occasions. I was very happy with the service and the food. The kebabs are soft and the salads fresh. I'd definitely recommend this place for a relaxed meal with friends or on the weekends by yourself.<//Review>

Best place for breakfast on Castro Street. Delicious omelets and strong house coffee. If you're a dessert person, the baklava is recommended. Good to sit outside when the weather is good. Fast friendly service.</Text>

I've been here a few times and my experiences have been mixed. The first time I was blown away by the delicious pastries and coffee. The second time I went I had the saddest sandwich ever. I could hardly enjoy the awesome environment and huge patio because my sad sad lunch drained all my energy. I'm sure I'll give it one more try though.< /review>

If I had to put a label on it, I'd call it a Turkish restaurant, but they also serve crepes and scrambles and other conventional breakfast cafe foods.  The food is very good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable - food ordering at the counter, order numbers on sticks, indoor and outdoor seating. I'm definitely going back for more.<//Review>

Became one of our new favorite places for breakfast.  The smaller or bigger your party, the faster you get in. Their coffee is a delicious blend   Service is fast and friendly - they even recognize us now! Food is wonderful - my friends and I have had everything from the menu, generous portions and everything is very fresh, prices are really cheap compare you get and location of-course. Would (and have) recommend for anyone looking for a non-chain breakfast place.</Text>

Service can be slow, you pay at the counter and they bring it to your table. At different times it can take them anywhere from 5-20min to bring tea with a cake. Food is good. It's near the road and Caltrain station, so can be quite noisy. Outdoor seating has shaded tables.<//Review>

I had an outstanding breakfast and a quick, cheap dinner at this place.
The breakfast was fantastic, with high quality Baklavas and other sweets. I quite like the Turkish/Greek verve and even the cappuccino was passable.
The dinner was nothing fancy but again clean, no-fuss food for a good value.</Text>

<name>Alina Adams< /name><text>Service can be slow, you pay at the counter and they bring it to your table. At different times it can take them anywhere from 5-20min to bring tea with a cake. Food is good. It's near the road and Caltrain station, so can be quite noisy. Outdoor seating has shaded tables.< /text>< user_id>

<review>The food is just alright, but the staff is friendly and the place has ample patio seating making it good for hosting families and big groups. It is also a spot one can work out of with plenty of tables and wi-fi so it's not uncommon to find people having lunch meetings and clacking away on weekdays.

Inside there's comfier seating towards the front by the mirror, and a good amount of tables. However, it's not unusual for this area to be highly fragrant with heavy cleaning scents which can compete with the fresh scents of the food and, as is my case, this detail can negatively impact the overall dining experience. If you are not phased by heavy fragrances, it's probably a non-issue for you :)

I still stop by for the occasional chai latte to-go before continuing the rest of my commute, or grab coffee and a snack and work from the patio in warmer weather.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Olympus is a nice cafe with a vegetarian-friendly menu. Even more importantly - with decent wifi, a fantastic outdoor patio, and staff that don't rush you out, it's my favorite place to camp out and get some work done. They have decent coffee, a nice entree menu, and an excellent desert bar.<//Review>

I had a Nefeli salad, which didn't have anything special about it. The sauce was very strong (too much vinegar), which may explain why they put it on the side and not already mixed in. I wouldn't come back for this.</text>

<Review>I ordered a Gyro Pita and waited over 30 minutes for it. It wasn't even crowded. What I eventually got was a pretty sorry excuse for a pita. The meat was all at the bottom and it was just topped with some lettuce. I'm sure some of the other dishes are better, but this experience makes it unlikely that I'll come back for them.<//Review>< pictures>

Doughy, raw pastry, undercooked, reheated, doesn't taste fresh, some random parts dry. Not flaky. Greasy, burnt edges & OVERPRICED. things taste STALE and OLD. Mushroom strudel would be better if it had more mushrooms(fresh everything would be nice) and if the pastry was cooked correctly and flaky and not raw on the inside.(AND LESS EXPENSIVE)
Desserts aren't any better, look upscale but are either way too sweet or underwhelming. Creme brulle cheesecake isn't so bad I like the fresh vanilla bean in there but crust is soft and not crunchy and flaky like traditional cheesecake. It's not the right consistency--a little too soft and no signature crunchy scorched sugar on top--its wet and soft.
Entrees are bland and underwhelming, and overcooked. Salmon extremely expensive for being overcooked and not fresh tasting.
Mint lemonade is nice.
All in all tastes like over priced hyped cafeteria food, which is great if you're into that.
They can do so much better for the prices they're charging.
Owners and Chefs....put some effort, buy local and fresh, don't penny pinch, don't freeze and don't overcook/undercook!
Save your money and take a nice drive to another establishment.<//text>

Had burnt Swiss burger despite asking for med well.  Asked for hot water for drink but was charged $2.95 for hot tea.  After getting the receipt I asked about the charge, the female staff told me well I have to ring up your water some way.  What???? Later on,  I asked a nearby male staff member who was busing a nearby table,  for more ketchup for the fries, I was told it's up there at the drinks (water/sugar/sweetner) counter near the door and pointed at the place.  No ketchup bottles in sight.  Asked another staff (a different female) about ketchup, she goes "it's in the kitchen ."  Will not be back.  There are plenty of other restaurants in downtown Mtn View w/ better customer service.<//review></record>

<review>Ordered two Spanakopita from this cafe in a Mountain View. Firstly was charged more than price displayed on window. Secondly had to tell staff that display case had several small flies and one large fly inside, to which they half-heartedly tried to get them out, however we persisted. We then received our pastries, which were luke-warm, when we asked for them to be hot, had sweet pastry with a savory filling, which was not made clear and the contents of the pastry was stale! We ended up taking one bite and throwing both of them away, a waste of nearly $9, would not recommend!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>This place is interesting because it offers a mixture of typical American breakfast food with middle eastern. The portions were huge, but the food was just OK. It is pricier than other better breakfast cafes in the area. I regret being to full to try the Arabic sweets and American cakes, which were very tempting.<//Review>< Pics>

One of our favourite spots for sweets! Their triangle baklava is a must every visit, and if you can go for breakfast/brunch try their kaymak + bal + Turkish tea! Absolutely delicious.
The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome.</Review>

Amazingly delicious juicy baklavas!! They have 3 or 4 different kinds of baklava and basically all of them taste amazing. The price is good and staff is friendly. They have plenty of space outside to enjoy your delicious desserts.

The not so good: I tried their lamb skewers and most of the meat was very chewy that some pieces i just could not breakdown with my teeth ( in the picture my plate looks beautiful though :D ). The salad and rice that came with it was good though. We ordered some falafels and they were not that good--the spices were super strong--We've never tasted falafels with that strong flavor before. Maybe I'll give the meat a second try in the future but for now I'm coming back for their baklava!!</text>

The nuts in the baklava look like taco meat, and the whole thing tastes burned. Inedible. Cappuccino is watery and bitter. Service is friendly, but will look elsewhere next time.< /Review>

This is a great place to grab a quick breakfast, or to sit down and sample the broader menu at brunch. I've done both and absolutely love their pastries, especially Borek which is a flaky pastry filled with meat. I'd also recommend the Turkish Breakfast.<//review>

Like the atmosphere, food just wasn't that good. Very plain and didn't incorporate the flavors. Had a spanikopita (wasn't fully warm), veggie crepe (veggies we're good and fresh at least) and penne pasta (sauce was eh). All nothing to write home about unfortunately. Sorry Olympus.<//review>

Food was pretty good, but expensive. Parking in this area is a nightmare, but overall I would recommend. A decent place to eat.<//Text>

Solid spot. Great coffee (never burned) and pretty good pastries, though a bit pricey.
The service is quite volatile. Sometimes they forget about one of your orders, and they almost never bring all your order at the same time.< /review>

Very good Turkish desserts and the patio is great to enjoy them with a tea. I was even lucky to have a customer with a very nice voice playing guitar and singing at a nearby table, but I don't expect that to happen often :)

Bosphorus would be better than caltrain tracks, but still a very enjoyable experience!

I should try their breakfast next time I stay in the area.< /review>

The sulaç pudding is fantastically creamy with a perfect hardened texture on the top. The menemen egg scramble is A+ as well.

Their omelets are pretty good the chicken marsala as well. Tried the swiss burger but it was a bit over cooked so if you like it medium ask when you order.

The best thing about this place is it had the nicest staff I've ever seen. Super friendly and smiling and chatting with you.</Review>

<Text>Absolutely delicious! It's exactly like Crepevine with slight differences in menu choices. I recommend this place whole-heartedly! Delicious food and good service, not too long a wait. You get to watch the trains go by as you eat.

We ordered the chicken panini and the French toast. Both were delicious!

It's in a good location and close to parking buildings. Not too crowded when I went (Wednesday at 4) although with how tasty this place is I imagine weekends and afternoons can get quite crowded.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Encountered VERY RUDE service by a young girl at cash register while waiting at Mountain View station from out of town. Subway across from station told me this place around corner has restroom. I tried to look for quick pickup so I can used their restroom. But 1 little piece of pastry even cost $3.95. She asked if I wanted it heated up, but then tell me it's going to take 6+ minutes. I said no thank you, I'm just waiting for my transit. She put the spanakopii pastry in a bag and put it on side of counter. I gave the cashier girl $5.00 then she said with tax it comes to $4.31
So I gave her $5.00 then told her wait a minute, I have a penny, handed her additional penny (1¢) then waited for my change but I didn't get it so I told her "um, change please?" Then she goes "you gave me a penny, what do you think? That I was going to give you a DOLLAR?" What the heck?! That's NO way to talk to ANY customer!
I said I haven't got my 70¢ back yet but she insisted she gave it back already, which I don't remember But it's just 70¢ & I didn't have time to argue about it. But she's just standing there not even giving me the receipt so I told her "receipt please" and she only reluctantly gave it to me making additional comment "what, you think I was going to cheat you or something?" And rudely stuck the receipt at me. I really felt like sticking the pastry back at her and get my $5 back, plus with her attitude she'll probably claim I tried to steal $5 from her anyway. So I just walked out.
After getting to my destination, I check my receipt, it said I gave her $5.00, not $5.01. I checked my wallet, I had at least 2 quarters in there before, so if she really gave me 70¢ back, I should have at least a dollar worth of quarters in there but I only have 3 right now. I'll never go back to this stinking place and hope the owner will fire her soon!<//Review>

The staff is unfailingly friendly, the spot is pleasant (especially the outdoor seating), and the food is very good. The Turkish dishes are their best (my favorites are the Sucuk Yumurta and the Sucuk Toast, because I love the Turkish sausage), but the other breakfast fare is good as well. The Turkish pastries are good, but the non-Turkish options look unremarkable. And don't bother with the uninspired non-Turkish dessert case, get a Turkish dessert like baklava instead.< /review>

I eat here frequently and I've been very happy with the food and the service. The kaymak and bal is very good, as are many of their savory and sweet pastries. I'm quite fond of the gozleme.

I also appreciate that it's not trying to be fancy or pretentious like many of the new restaurants on Castro. It's just good food.< /Text>

<text>Visited this place regularly for three months when I lived close to Castro. Absolutely love the breakfast items, must try the stuffed omlette selection and pancakes along with their cappuccino. Personally love some of the Turkish treats they offer like the gozleme stuffed with spinach and feta cheese or the baklava and the spanakopita. The seating outside is great, directly overlooking the Caltrain station and on Sundays the farmers market.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6</GmapID></record>

< Review>
Came for dinner, their gyros are horrible. They're anything but a gyro. They come unwrapped and full of lettuce and other crap that does NOT go in a gyro and I'm not talking on the side. What kind of gyro comes with a thin pita split open with mostly green letuce (instead of onions, tomatoes, lamb, fries tzaziki). When you eat, it falls apart and you have to resort to fork and knife. I'm never coming for dinner here again.</Review>

I would give 5 stars, but customer service needs a bit of improvement.  Ordered an item we never received, even after asking twice.  Food great though.  Near the Caltrain station, which is great for commuters but bad for background noise.<//text>

Turkish & Greek dishes + American breakfast + American/Mediterranean cafe entrees & lots of cakes/pastries/desserts. Casual & pleasant cafe atmosphere with outdoor seating (helpful since we often walk there and eat outside with our dog). Service is always pleasant.
I have to confess many dishes are imperfect (for example, I'm always looking for a good breakfast spot; they have a lot of breakfast options, but I find them just OK), but I like some of their items a lot. That plus the service and atmosphere have me coming back often.
I like their desserts, pastries, & paninis. What to get:
- chocolate cake (chocolate cake with chocolate mousse)
- spinach-and-feta gozleme (a savory Turkish pastry...like a filled flaky flatbread)
- chocolate-hazelnut croissant (the croissant is definitely on the very soft side, but it makes me happy enough)
- Athenian Panini (grilled bell pepper, grilled eggplant, tomato, Kalamata olives, provolone)
-Shakshuka
- Capellini Pomodoro (angel hair pasta w/ tomato, basil, olive oil, garlic).
- mint tea</text>

< review>
The Dolmas was very mushy. Pine nuts not recognizable in the Dolmas .The lamb gyro was very chewy like jerky.The tomatoes were pink not red. No sauce that could be counted because like the one slice of cucumber was at the end of the pita. Awful.< /review>

<text>A Turkish bakery and caffe. The service was great, friendly staff, and a great environment. The owner is a nice man from Turkey, he owns a restaurant down the street that we are going to have to check out tomorrow.

We ordered a chocolate chip cookie, and it was massive and delicious, definitely worth the dollar fifty. We also ordered an Acma, which was described to us as a cinnamon roll without the cinnamon. Free hot water and Wi-Fi too, overall great experience. Highly Recommend.

The next day when we stopped by however, we tried to get a cup of hot water to put our tea in, and they tried to make us pay for it, unlike most establishments, which kind of put a dent in the love of the place.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Admittedly, I didn't order their specialties but my Denver omelette and coffee were fine, not great. For the price (which I suppose is normal for the area) I expected more.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent food, excellent coffee, very quiet place.
I recommend ordering the twist on pita bread, they give it with a salad that has a delicious dressing.
I ordered a large American coffee, and it really is great; I like that they have liquid milk to put the coffee and they have brown sugar to sweeten.
Desserts look delicious I ordered the chocolate mouse in a glass and it is a delight for those who want to eat sweet. To my taste it is something cloying.

(Original)
Excelente comida, excelente café, lugar muy tranquilo.
Recomiendo pedir el giro en pan pita, lo dan con una ensalada que tiene un aderezo delicioso.
Pedí un café americano grande, y realmente es grande; me gusta que tienen leche líquida para ponerle al café y tienen azúcar morena para endulzar.
Los postres se ven deliciosos yo pedí el mouse de chocolate en Copa y es una delicia para los que apetecen de comer dulce. A mi gusto es algo empalagoso.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A lifetime option for a quick coffee shop on Castro Street in mountain view, close to Google, Computer history museum. Beware of the American caffe, you're basically a watery espresso ... The chocolate pudding looks appetizing, but it's a type of flan, but quite a bit, I do not think it's very good. The espresso was good

Uma vida opção para um café rápido na Castro Street em mountain view, pertinho do Google, Computer history museum. Cuidado com o caffe americano, vc é basicamente um espresso aguado... O pudim de chocolate parece apetitoso, mas é um tipo de flan, mas bem molengo, não achei muito bom. O espresso estava bom</Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Perfect for a tea break while waiting for the caltrain right from the station. There are many types of cakes, and they all look delicious! I got tiramisu and mousse chocolate. Both latte and cake are my favorite.
Many outside tables were comfortable.
