Review is for meal prep only.

This is now the third meal prep service I've tried, and I'm so happy I did! I've been looking for a meal prep service that actually includes adequate veggies in their meals. The food is good, and you can choose your meals! I'm very happy so far. Pic is of a meal reheated straight from the container- good portions and a good amount of veggies.</Text>

Food was delicious. I thought the meal preps we're good. Definitely chef quality food in dine-in restaurant. Would definitely go back to try out different options. Make sure you go before the lunch rush as it could take a bit to get your food. Food was worth it though< /Text>

I love Black Market Meal Prep! I've been coming here for years since they've been open. I can't believe it's taken me so long to actually post a review. The customer service and energy that they have here is stellar and infectious. Luis in particular is amazing and and an absolute rockstar. He's attentive and you get the feeling that he genuinely cares about his team and clients. He's always greeting people by name and with a smile that finds its way through the face mask. The entire team has great customer service.

The food is also delicious! I was craving healthy and tasty food options after workouts years ago when I came across Black Market Meal Prep online. My first dine in meal was a chicken build your own entree and I was hooked. I was so excited that I couldn't stop recommending the place to anyone that would listen from my gym, work, and friends. It's been who knows how years and I still have that same enthusiasm. I've gotten my new co-workers hooked on their meals and the protein donuts they distribute. I'd highly recommend trying their restaurant and meal prep service. Bison burger and chicken anything for the dine in are my go tos. I'm partial to their chicken and beef options for the meal prep. I tend to stay away from the fish meals. Philippino chicken, kbbq beef, and   ¿Mexican market?, I think it's called, style chicken are my favorite meal preps.

Keep up the awesome work</Text>

I should have taken a picture.  I have tried most of their bowls and they are excellent!  My very favorite bowl is the lunchador!  The steak was so so tender and cooked perfectly and the vegetables were so good!  I can’t wait to try some of their other items!  Keep up the GREAT work Black Market!  I am a customer for LIFE!!! ❤️❤️❤️</text>

<Text>Looking for a healthy meal - look no further. Black Market Kitchen in Orange is pretty darn amazing. I often order in from them as they are one of the few outfits with healthy mindful meals.

Pictured here is a quinoa bowl with Ahi Tuna on a bed of asparagus, brussel sprouts, green beans and avocado topped off with a fried egg. I ordered the chimichurri sauce which was excellent. This is a huge portion and the veggies and quinoa fill you up. The Ahi Tuna was excellent too.</Text><user_id>112770384663248320983</user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dd25e6bcab3437:0xb7c555843210281f<//Gmap_id><username>Khurram Mir</username>< resp>

The food is good the portions and flavors is perfect the big problem with them is the service I called to order my food and they put my call in hold for 15 min, and never answer you can’t wait for this time is super long time other big issue my same two meal cost me here in the Restaurant $27 VS Uber Eats I did last week for $45.00 that’s the reason I  try to call but isn’t work and the web site is not for  order special meals like you can do here or in Uber eats they need fix this problem<//text>

<review>First coming here and I got the salmon entree. The food was really and with great portion size. I  even had to take leftovers home. It is very convenient for those who like to meal prep during the week but don't have time to do it themselves. Also, I noticed everything is made fresh and on the spot.< /review>< GmapID>

We've had to spend quite a bit of time at St Joseph Hospital due to a family member being there and today we wanted to venture out to find some food other than Hospital cafeteria food. We were going to go into Togo's but I noticed the sign on the door and immediately thought it was a place to go in make dinners that you would take home to eat later. Turns out it's a nice little restaurant making some seriously good food. Nothing complicated here you pick a protein which can range from chicken to veggie patty to fish. You then pick a vegetable and last you pick a carb which can range from sweet potatoes to rice. I ordered a beverage and they have the natural sodas dispensed in a fountain that were very good. They provide alkaline water that's chilled for free. We sat down in a booth that was clean and the silverware was nicely wrapped in a paper napkin. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. We were pleasantly surprised to have a very simple meal that tasted excellent. We both had the chicken which was tender, seasoned and grilled nicely. I had three vegetables and no carbs. The vegetables were cooked perfect meaning not overdone or too crunchy and nicely seasoned. I honestly could eat here everyday substituting my chicken for fish. The owner was in and we talked for a few minutes, nice guy. This is a terrific find and we'll definitely be back soon.</Text>

I’ve been taking my son here for a few years. I’ve absolutely loved this place, until my last experience and will not go back. The dentist was extremely pushy on a procedure and when I declined he brought in another extremely pushy scheduler and walked me back to the computer to try and force an appointment out of me. If my son wasn’t still set up in the chair I would have walked out right then and there. When I left I asked for the estimate and the procedure he was trying to push on me was $1,200!!! It was a completely different experience than I have ever had there. The forcing and cornering was such a turn off I’m taking my business elsewhere.< /review>

<Review>The secretary was very rude. They sent the paperwork that the wrong phone number, so I did not receive it and they did not try to contact my spouse or anyone to confirm we had received it and filled it out. I drove out of my way 30 minutes so that my son could see the same dentist he has been seeing for years, by appointment. only for them to tell me that it would take too long to fill out the paperwork and they couldn’t be seen. The customer service was absolutely terrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone. I even arrived early in case there was paperwork to fill out (which I was not aware of and no effort had been made to contact me or my husband, the other contact on file). Finding a new dentist for my kids now.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I have been taking my children here since my son was 6months old. He will be 8 in June. I love the doctors and the staff in front used to be nice and professional. I had an appointment and brought my daughter all the way from Temecula (while experiencing morning sickness from my current pregnancy) to walk in to a secretary at the from (Mariela) who sounds like she was on a personal call. 2 mins after waiting for her to hang up, she asks have I filled out forms they sent me the day prior. I was given the appointment a month ago and no one said I would be sent forms 1 day before my appointment nor was it texted she said they emailed me which I’m definitely not looking for this email because I was unaware of receiving it. I was then told she is going to see if my daughter can still be seen. So I told her that makes no sense because no one told us of forms to fill out. She then tells me no it’s because you are 10 mins late. Mind you, she was on the phone when I came in and I was only about 8 mins late, but besides that there has always been a grace period of 15mins (I have been coming to them for 7 years now smh. I got upset and told her I am freaking pregnant and drove up here to be told we may not be seen, just please get a manager. She tells me she is the manager and never mind You can leave. I have never known a manager say they have to see with staff if We can still be seen. If you are the manager you could make that happen. But she was so snobby and didn’t want to be at work in the first place. I will never bring my kids here again. Definitely lost our business.</Review>< Date>

If they they have less I would selected that. My grandchild (5y) had very painful issues with his teath made appointment for dental evaluation and treatment referred by denti-cal they service was rendered however I was shocked that I had to take him to another place fir the work (tooth fairy). After providing all information to them and got pre-authorized for service and waiting...at the appointment I was told that they can not see him as I do not have the original medical card just the number and I should wait till I provide it regardless if they got authorization or not. When I told them I been told by the other dentist that my grandchild will be doing the work at this office and they already confirmed all coverage and they did the evaluation and X-ray and came only for the work!!!I was told no they are not associated-with any other dentist but there’s and they need to do new evaluation and X-ray as new.
I nearly lost my temper as I thought it’s always what’s the best interest of the kids precedes any and all but copy of a card is more important than my grandchild “pain”</text>

The doctors are great. The office staff seems nice when you talk to them or just have standard visit, but if you need anything outside of the visit they really do not seem to know what they are doing.
It is a shame to ask for a simple progress report and they refuse to give it to you. Instead they want to give you what they call a ledger and call that a report. When I explain I do not want a copy of the bill or charges just a simple progress report it was such a hassle. Now I have to fill out a form for a copy of my child's records and find a new dentis . What a shame that a 6 year old would have to leave a dentist they like over something as simple as simple progress report of the says visit.< /Text>

<user_id>113758304592980156810< /user_id><text>If I could I would post zero stars. My 3 children were patients for YEARS. Until I got suspicious of the alleged cavities they said my toddler had. My other children had cavities filled by them. Took my kids to a different dentist for a second opinion and said how fine her teeth were. Showed me on the x ray that the suggested work by Tooth Fairy Dental was very unneeded. To top it off my son is now having to get his fillings that were done by Tooth Fairy Dental redone because they still had decay when they filled them. Im very mad that it is causing my 7 yr old extra pain and procedures. I stayed for years for how nice they seem and how comfortable they make the kids. Glad I saw in my eyes that they didnt have my kids best interest in mind</text><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

I liked this place for my daughter at first. But it takes months for appts. And require 24hr notice of cancellation. If not they charge $36. If you have other kids with you and your little one needs laughing gas to get a procedure done. you cannot be in there. You need another adult to go in or hold your little while you stay with your kid.</Text>

Such an awesome place! My daughter was absolutely terrified of the dentist. We were in and out in less then an hour for 2 extractions. They made her feel so comfortable. Brandon is so friendly and professional! Looking forward to our next appointment. Thanks guys!< /text>

Overall great Staff and Doctors. My kids like it here and feel comfortable when receiving their treatments. The only downside side is accommodating service for all my kids at the same time. As a single mother you want to be able to treat as many kids as possible. To avoid going back and forth and missing so much time off work. But I know this is something that can easily be fixed.<//Text>

I am happy to say that even though i had read bad reviews from this place, i gave it a chance because a friend referred me here. Today was our first time as a new patient and both my son and i were happy to have received exceptional service from the whole staff. This is a great environment for kids! Great job!<//text>

The staff at A Tooth Fairy is always helpful and friendly. I have had bad experiences with previous dentist. Here they are different. They care about the patients and help them feel at ease. My three kids love going to their dentist. I would recommend them to all parents.</Review>

<text>First of all, when additional documentation is needed for insurance. Even something as small as a receipt ledger they will state they can't fax it due to human error factor while faxing. It takes two weeks to get your records to change dentist due to the lack of customer service. Realize that they create new rules not policy or procedures when it suits them not for the patient. Poor business relations.< /text>< username>

I being going to here for that last pass 2 years, and I am so happy 😁 with them all that stuff are super nice . Doctors are always taking that time to talk to me if is any concern that I may have . Is just in one occasion. I come in late for a few minutes they don't want to see my kid anymore I ask to talk to that manager , she was so nice and try to calm me down. She managed that situation with a good and positive way offering other day . I left that day super mad 😡 but after all . I call them back to re schedule an appointment. One of that reason why I when back is becuase my kids love it 😍. And is so nice when they call you to remind you about your appointment, I am very happy with their service 👍. Thank you tooth fairy .

<Text>I love this place. All the doctors and assistants are so nice. My kid broke his front tooth today and they took us in. When I came out from the treatment room, I over heard another mom yelling at the front desk girl saying that she has been waiting for 30mins. I had to tell her that I'm sorry, but my kid had an accident at school and was rush here to get his tooth put back in and I think they took us in and that's why they are running behind.

A mom to another mom. Please be patience because I really believe they are doing the best they can.

Thank you Mariela for getting us in for the emergency and sorry that you got yelled at.</Text><Time>1515817820411</Time></record>

<Text>My daughter has been coming here for 3 years now.  She LOVES this place and begs to go to the dentist.  They are very gental. My daughter has had fillings done and she swears up and down that they never gave her shots and that the whole proceedure didn't hurt at all.  They definitely gave her shots as I watched them do it.  I would recommend this place to all of my friends that have kids.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dc9bc4366c94b5:0xff1ddbd0c9ad183a< /gmapID><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Awesome! Since moving to Menifee, I had struggled to find a decent kid dentist, so for 5 years I continued to drive to Hemet! Until, Dr. Patel (an equally amazing dentist) referred us to Tooth Fairy for a root canal. The staff is friendly and helpful and they put the kids at ease. My kids have had great experiences and look forward to each visit. (The prize display doesn't hurt as encouragement) 😉< /Text>< Pics>

Walked in to schedule appointment to make sure we got all the paperwork and records needed to fill 3 cavities that had already been diagnosed.  First available was 2 weeks out, showed up and they wouldn't fill his cavities, which is what we scheduled the apportionment for to start with. Said they needed to do another check up and cleaning and more xrays and the first available time to fill the cavities would be almost 2 months out.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<user>113756976422630126252</user><Text>I have taken my kids here from the start and my kids are now 3 and 6. In the beginning I was beyond pleased with the efficiency of this practice. The dentist and staff always went above and beyond to make my young kids feel comfortable. However lately I feel they are heading in a downwards spiral. Both my kids had appointments this morning and we were there 15 mins before scheduled time and the office was empty! We however waited 45 mins in the lobby before being called back for my 1st appointment! When asked what was taking so long got the excuse they are wiping down the chair and will call us shortly, another 15 mins goes by and now I get an excuse the dr is running behind!!!?? So I’m like ok, she’s taking her time and giving “good care” for the patient before us. We get called in and with in 15 mins did two cleanings and exams on my kids and was rushed out of there!!! Dentist saying “your times up” when asking a question! “I’m with another patient”!!! I’m floored! The patient before me was there “over her time” and my kids don’t get the quality care they deserve and waited for patiently. What’s the point of making an appointment if every time we are there it takes 45-1hr to be seen?! They need to hire more dentists or teach the one I saw today to be more efficient and give same amount of time to each patient< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

I would really think twice about taking your children here.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I took my daughter here because she has a cavity. She was very scared and the lady that took her xrays was kind of rude! She gave up and didn't even finish taking her x-rays. They sent me to Loma linda so they can put my daughter under anesthesia just to do her x-rays! Aren't you supposed to be patient? I felt very uncomfortable and definitely won't be back.</text>

<text>I have been trying to take my daughter back for her check up and they keep scheduling me 2 or 3 weeks out she had an appointment today but she is sick she had a rough night when I called to male sure I could still bring her they said no put then told me to reschedule I have to pay 35 $ because it wasn't 24hr notice ... she was not sick like this yesterday. These people work with kids and don't understand how much can happen in 2 or 3 weeks ... I want to take her but they won't see her now because they have that rule they want me to pay 35$ how is that right!!<//text><date>1486656740978</date><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_name>

Definitely call the shop directly if you haven't been here before. The online booking link only goes to one barber. But when I called I learned that there are other barbers available that aren't affiliated with the booking portal. I was able to walk right in once I spoke with them on the phone.  Dan hooked me up with a clean fade at a competitive price.  Glad I decided to call. Found a good fade spot near home in West Sac.  I certainly reccomend them.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1599104756966, 'text': 'Just call the shop for now 916-371-4921.  Sorry for the inconvenience'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>It was a complete waste of time The Barbers were unprofessional they kept stopping in the middle of haircuts to change the channels on the TV.  They took too long on one guy who didn't even have any hair. Supposedly they're license but they don't know how to do a simple bowl cut. They made many racial comments while there. Talk too much. Very unprofessional.  Never go in it's a waste of time and money.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I was rather disappointed after waiting an hour to find out the barber wasn't able to perform a simple undercut. I even explained that it was shaved sides with longer on top, and even provided a visual aid, but he continuously announced how he had "never done one of those before" and that he was "unsure how to cut it".  The staff took a very long time finishing up the previous customers, checking their phones, changing the television channel, and chatting the entire time. Upon seeing the amount of hair I had, the barber exclaimed that it was "definitely time for me to get a haircut" as well as a couple of "oh wows" and wide eyed stares. The subject of conversation became racist and unintelligent as they discussed their misperceptions of European culture. Overall, it was a complete waste of time, energy and after I was finally seated to have my hair cut, he almost immediately removed the cloth from around my neck asking me if I wanted to go elsewhere due to his lack of knowledge on the hairstyle. And this was after making fun of other licensed barbers. Don't waste your time like I did.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>The haircuts are nice and Its definitely not a let down with the cheap prices. They do take their time, I got a 1 fade with nothing on top and it took 1.5hrs but it was very nicely done. Unless you are waiting on a specific person to cut your hair its usually a get in and sit down deal.< /Review>< pictures>

I went here three times. Had two different guys cut my hair. They didn't listen to what I wanted. They were set their ways and didn't want to hear a different opinion. When I went for the last time the guy started arguing with me about what I told him for my hair. He then called me a liar and said that I didn't know anything in front of all the employees and customers. I walked out furious. I'd rather shave my head then go back to this place.<//Review>

This is the most legit barber shop I've ever been to. Bill is incredibly awesome and all of the other barbers are great too. I suggest you always make an appointment as this is a popular spot to say the least. They do great razor fades which I feel is a dieing breed in the barber industry.<//text>

This one of the last places for the average Joe to get a cut (and a shave). No extra jell, mousse or foo-foo with your haircut. Just clean and professional. It's busy and that's because people know a good business when they go to one.</Text>

<Text>It has been a long time for me to eat at  any flame broiler so today I was really hungry and I in went in, the cashier I don't know if Emma was just tired or she's pregnant and tired but she needs a little bit more training on customer service cause she barely said hello  never really smiled. I order half & half chicken & Beef  with half & half rice & vegetables to go. I was Getting my drink they had zero vitamin water lemonade it had no flavor so they had another  flavor vitamin water  the Acai berry & pomegranate.   I looked in my bag for napkins I had to get napkins on my own  So I walk to my car which was a little ways away was about to eat realize adding get a fork side to go into another restaurant to get a fork my food was OK it wasn't hats off the grill so that means it is sitting and not being freshly made but it was OK the sauce says we're OK our probably go back to that flame broiler any flame broiler that is in whatever area I'm in if I need to get food.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2b746c8561ba1:0x170b162bc574f503</GmapID></record>

The one at the counter just kept drying the floor with a sign. I gave it a full minute then I walked out. Who ever owns this spot is missing out on money because of the bad customer service.

I'm here often and they're inconsistent on how they cook their white meat (too burnt, burnt on one side, or chewy raw as seen on the photo). I brought it to their ATTN and instead of having them replace/rework my order, the chef stated they ran out of white meat. Mind you a few orders were coming out of white meat, and I patiently waited an extra 20 minutes on Friday as they got a shipment of white meat. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. #FAIL</review>

<Review>Basking robins has delicious ice creams, my favorite is the old fashioned butter pecan. Usually go for the smallest cup cuz they fill you up bro.

Worst customer service.
Went at 12 noon and was closed, per timings they should have opened at 11
Half of flavors are not available as their cold storage was broken.<//Text>

< Review>
Ordered a birthday cake two days ahead of the party. When I arrived on the party day and was told the cake was never done. Never called me ahead. Actually it took the store boy over 20 mins to contact the manager  over the phone to figure that out. Ruined my party without apologies.
this place is run by several high school boys, with the guidance from a legendary manager nobody ever met. These boys had to call the manager for everything, even how to place a customized order, or how to give a refund, which took forever for you to wait, then told you it's beyond their capability. hard to work with, only time wasted. Better go to somewhere else.Never come again.< /Review>

If you’re looking for the Stranger Things Baskin Robbin Exclusive Funko Pop, DO NOT GO HERE!! The POP itself is 12.99 and they’re selling it for $40 with a limit to 1/person! Not only that, they sold the first person the pop at the price of 12.99 but changed the price at the register in front of everyone else that was waiting to $40. That’s ridiculous!

You’ll have a better chance of getting it at a cheaper price online.<//Text>

Signage says they open at 11:30.   It's the day after Thanksgiving.   It's now 12:30 and no one has come to open the store. I've seen many people come by only to see the store still closed.</review>

I just witnessed an unfortunate event.  I came in last night and employee "Brandon" (according to his badge) tried to take my order when he was abruptly stopped by "Evan" ( I'm guessing his supervisor)  in a very rude, harsh and unprofessional manner. He said " you! Clock out your gone" Brandon tried telling him he just wanted to take my order before he left and again this Evan guy stops him and says " No! I told you clock out and leave"!  His approach was so unprofessional as this whole thing unfolded in front of me, the customer, and unprofessional towards Brandon.  This type of behavior is not far from bullying in the workplace and worty of an official complaint to California employment and labor.  I hope this Evan guy get some kind of disciplinary action for his unprofessional manners.< /text>

Place was filthy. The metal of the glass covering on the counter is filled with dirty liquid and moldy ice cream toppings, seemed  like they haven’t cleaned them for days. Also, came there to get the limited edition pop funko and no employee helped me. They were all helping out other customers who came before me. They told me to wait and I stood their for about 15 minutes until I left.</Text>

<review>The owner was incredibly friendly and personable. I have never purchased a gun. He helped me through the process and in choosing a piece for home protection. I don't think I could have had a more pleasant experience. Just overall a really nice guy! A decent enough selection and can get you whatever you want if it's not there.< /review>< pictures>

Smaller store. Owner is very knowledgeable and friendly. The only complaint is that the guns are slightly more expensive. I figure its due to being one of the few still open gun stores in the area and being located in California. Bought a 40cal Shield, very pleased.< /Text>

Not at all surprised this place has such a good rating.

I didn't check reviews or anything, just wanted to stop by a local gun store and ask some questions about guns (total newbie btw, literally never shot a gun in my life).

The small store is absolutely packed with fishing gear n stuff, but I was able to see down the short hallway to a counter with some handguns and shotguns on display

Once I got back there I was greeted warmly and I began perusing the selection and asking my questions.

Not once did I feel any embarrassment or awkwardness or anything. I'm sure he answered many of my questions a million times but he delivered consistently great customer service.

If you're a first timer you'll need an fsc to buy a gun. They do it there for 25 bucks. I'd highly recommend choosing this place, since he was so beginner friendly.< /Text>

So I went to Bass pro shop. Big mistake. I got a hour's worth of cold shoulder with $700 in hand to buy a Glock. So I went to these guys & was glad I did. Super cool, very patient, and got the impression that they are genuinely concerned with my lack of experience. Even the other patrons were raving about these guys. I was so impressed, I dropped almost a grand. I'm picking up my 2 weapons on Thursday and will probably by another. So if you can remember and appreciate how customer service 'used' to be, you owe it to yourselves to experience what these people have to offer.

Always great. I've made purchases here regularly here for over 11 years. Just making an observation of a comment from a customer who purchased a used SKS. A firearm was purchased and the serial number is registered to you; it becomes a matter of factory service or warranty. You cannot just swap out a firearm with another as you would a TV at Best Buy; there is red tape and govt paperwork that is registered to the firearm in question. Think before you buy or whine about that purchase.<//review>

Oh my word. Come here and unwind, and be ready to undo the top button on your pants by the end of the meal. SO good you won't want to stop eating until every morsel is gone. Make sure to have dessert too. It's DEFINITELY worth it.< /Review>

Horrendous . I hate leaving a negative review for any establishment. But this place was absolutely horrible . My huevos rancheros came out Lukewarm and covered in what tasted like watered down pace picante salsa . Our glasses were dirty and it took our waiter 10 mins just to return with creamer for our coffee . 4 tables around us sat unbussed. The floors had food crumbs on them.  They forgot parts of our order The dishes were pieced together in random fashion. I do not recommend this place at all. You will end up disappointed and having spent too much money.

To the restaurant;

Please focus on your attention detail and cleanliness. The condition of your restaurant was shameful . If it weren’t for the protection of the Westin surely your lack of standard for cleanliness and attention to detail would close you down. Please take the time with your staff to pay attention to these types of details as they make a difference.<//Review>

Well known as a great dinner spot, of late we have been going for breakfast and weekend brunch. We ordered poached eggs with crispy hash browns and buttermilk pancakes. The food was delicious and visually appealing. We ate in the dining room rather than the patio on this day due to wet conditions out of doors.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><gmap_id>0x80dafd55c485b8c9:0x59ca035ee2ba2683<//gmap_id><review>WOW!  Great Views.  Great food. INCREDIBLE service. Very reasonably priced.  Service and food quality I am used to finding at restaurant that are considerably more expensive.  If you are looking for phenomenal dining experience, please try Pinzimini -- it will surprise you!

We arrived at Pinzimini for a romantic dinner and our experience simply blew us out of the water. The staff were incredibly knowledgeable and attentive (without being intrusive).  Their guidance through the menu down to minutia of preparation was beyond helpful --  INCLUDING how modifications in preparation and ingredients might affect the overall balance of the final dish -- I will mention that the wine suggestions were also perfect.

The outdoor dining was designed to maximize views.  For those on the perimeter (which most tables are), you are rewarding with an expansive view of the lush resort property.  Off the perimeter is a very large central table augmented by an expansive and visually engaging firepit.

100% will return.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxXnPw8TJyjBAbJDqu6n_l39P0pv2itqteh9Ml=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdRQ56hpQhL5Mlxaz-ID5A-S8rn3apKTt-440-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< date>

Located on the grounds of the Westin Rancho Mirage Hotel, this restaurant provides excellent service and delicious meals. I came in for dinner and was not disappointed. High compliments to my server Angel, he recommended some great wine pairings with the meals. The pasta and meat balls are made by hand in house. I had the pork chop dish and enjoyed every bite. If you can take the heat, the exterior seating has lovely views of the palm trees within the atrium of the hotel amongst the pools.< /Review>

<date>1605635114542<//date><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Sorely disappointed in this restaurant for a Westin.  While the service was excellent at our group (practicing COVID19 distancing) - the food left much to be desired.  Especially the price of food for what you end up not getting.  But the execution was just average.  Others in our group said they have been to the Brunch here which was also average, at best.  Sad..........

Mixed drinks were terrible, i.e., there was plenty of tonic in my vodka tonic - but literally no vodka.

The Westin has some pretty places to sit if you can social distance but don't think you need to order food or drinks, unless maybe a beer but even though choices are less than stellar given how many craft beer potentials are out there.

Don't go out of your way to go here.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Had both breakfast and lunch here in October. It's a very nice restaurant with in or outdoor seating. For dinner I had spaghetti and meatballs because they make their own meatballs with a combination of beef and veal. Serving was plentiful, tasty and plated well. Zinfindel was a good option for my dish. Although I was looking forward to dessert, I was too full. Breakfast the next morning also hit the spot. Eggs, toast, homefries and, of course, bacon. My son downed a plate of pancakes and eggs and from the smile on his face, I know he liked it. The restaurant service was very attentive and pleasant for both visits, while the decor was open , clean and somewhat upscale. I would definitely recommend a visit to this Elegant Westin Mission Hills establishment.< /text><date>1572341502913<//date><Rating>5</Rating><user_name>Robert Staffa</user_name>< pics>

Great for breakfast.  Good food and service.  Dinner is another thing.  Waiters not up to the task.  Serving Italian food, but you have to ask for parmesan, etc.  Need to be retrained.   Evening dining isn't enjoyable.<//review>

Lunch was quite good. The local interpretation of the Caprese Salad adds watermelon and beets and is quite tasty. Their burger is better than average, clearly handmade instead of using a foodservice patty. Service was caring without being heavy handed. Hotel restaurants are generally only "meh" but this one is better than that.<//Review>

<Review>This is a so nice and beautiful.  It is a restaurant inside of Westin Rancho Mirage Resort and Spa.  This is a most beautiful Westin in this area.  They have hotel and villas next to each other.  A good waalk way between the hotel and villas along the amazing goft course.  Pinzimini is an of few resraurants in this resort, it is great and friendly service, good foods either buffet or cook to order.  It is so relaxing atmosphere around here speicial at night.  The have several outdoor fireplace and it is a good place to hang around for a whole family.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Had the Calabrese Pizza, it was phenomenal. They serve a piece of Rosemary Bread, and a Riccotta cheese as a spread to entertain you while you wait for the main course. Atmosphere is wonderful. Fireplaces are everywhere and you can sometimes hear and see the entertainment from the other restaurant in the Hotel. Patio is great, bar is seating is great and the rest of the place is a little more traditional and intimate!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dafd55c485b8c9:0x59ca035ee2ba2683</gmap_id></record>

<text>Went for happy hour at the bar. My wife ordered the house chardonnay that she said had no flavor. We had the pizza and the calamari. Pizza was so greasy with oil it almost slid off the plate and was not very good. The calamari was not very appealing and half the portion was fried olives-weird!
Not a good experience.</text><pics>None</pics><user_name>neil naroff</user_name>< Gmap_id>

Nice place. Elizabeth, the server, did a great work taking care of my family. About the menu, you have several choices, drinks prices is the average prices in Palm Springs area.< /text>

Horrible service and even worse food. Took us over 30min to get water and some bread, food got to us 1hr and 36min later! Food was cold, looked unappealing, salmon dish was raw in center and simply a terrible experience for the prices charged at this place. Now maybe our fault for hoping for a good meal @ 830 on a Saturday night, they close @ 10pm but it was not very full and had ample staff so we decided let's give it a go. I'd highly suggest driving the 1.5mi to the east to find a large variety of food options, pricing that was on par for the type of food offered. Do not eat here!</Text>

This place just is not what they advertise it is. For the prices and verbage of an 'award winning chef', we expected a lot more. The food was clearly premade and microwaved - the $22 lasagna was cold in the center. They will not leave you a bread basket - you must ask your server for each small slice at a time. The service was awkward, unfriendly, and rushed. There were people being seated for dinner wearing swimsuits and carrying large pool floats.
We expected an upscale, chef-prepared dinner. This was truly everything but. A well deserved one star.<//Review>

The staff was quite friendly, and the outdoor seating is beautiful. The menu is a bit pricey, and the quality of the meal itself was decent once, and just okay another time. My wife enjoyed the egg white omelet for breakfast one morning, which was solid, while I had the eggs Benedict which was exactly as advertised. We went back for lunch the next day (because let’s be honest, the hotel has limited food options) and we were both disappointed in our respective choices of a chicken panini and the lamb burger (I’m a fan of blue cheese, but damn!).
The primary reason for my 2-star assessment is that the service was unjustifiably slow for both meals. We sat for breakfast at 10:00 on a Friday and waited 10 minutes for coffee, and an additional 30 for our fairly basic egg dishes. We sat at 11:00 on Saturday when the restaurant was at ~30%, were sat without menus, ordered about 15 minutes later, and didn’t have meals in front of us until 11:40. We later realized that we also never received the Diet Coke my wife ordered.
Today, we went to the coffee shop and got bagels for breakfast. I’d rather eat at the airport than try my luck at pinzimini for a third time. The other 6 reviews look good, so maybe they are just having an off weekend, but I won’t be back to find out.<//text>

For expensive Italian restaurant I was disappointed.
The service was fast and staff were friendly and polite.
But the shrimp were old and should have been discarded yesterday on the salad.
The Volcano pizza was good,  but the crust was soggy in the even after I requested that it be burt?< /text>

A nice place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would it give 5 stars but... why did you remove the huevos rancheros from the menu!!??? Those were the best in the entire Palm Springs area, bad decision.< /Review>

A truly wonderful dining experience especially for being a hotel restaurant.  One of my favorite things about this place are the mini green juice samples they give to people waiting to get a table in the morning.< /text>

< Review>
My husband I moved in here about six months ago and we love it!
We are both full time working professionals so it is so nice to have 24hour laundry mat. The layout is just perfect for us two. My favorite thing about the community is how friendly and helpful the manager Cristina is. From the day I came in to ask for an application she has been nothing but helpful and on top of things. I always know she is a call or text away. If I have any questions, I know I can go to her and it will get answered/taken care of. So professional and down to earth. 100% recommend.<//Review>

If you’re looking for a great place to live in Escondido the Grand Rose Apartments are definitely at the top of the list. From management, to community and environment, everything here is top notch. The manager (Cristina) is on site Monday - Friday. She is always either a phone call or a quick walk away in the office. This cannot be said for many of the apartment complexes in Escondido. Anything you need  or any problem you have in your apartment, she and the maintenance workers are on it. Unlike other places, you aren’t waiting around forever to get things taken care of. The complex has various courtyards throughout the property each with its own appeal. There’s a area with barbecue grills, tables and seats for anyone to enjoy. There’s a pool and a 24 hour laundry room which are always neat. They have two vending machines there along with a water dispenser. Although it’s very pet and child friendly, the property is always clean and in order. Usually those two things don’t go well together, but that isn’t the case here. The manager makes sure people are behind their pets, their children and that the kids are able to enjoy playtime. People can walk around the complex peacefully with their pets and they clean up after themselves to keep the property in good shape. Maintenance is always cleaning around and making sure everything around the property works both inside and outside of the apartments. One of the best parts about living here is the security you feel. There are cameras around the complex and security gates. Not just anyone can get inside. Everyone has their own assigned parking and you don’t have to worry about kids running around in the parking lots. This is a great place to live whether you have kids, pets or neither; there’s a place for everyone here. It’s a very welcoming community. Everything considered, it’s one of the best places to live in Esco. I recommend it to anyone looking to move!</Review>

<review>The apartments have come a long way. It used to be horrible here and I almost broke my lease because it was out of control. Things have changed so much for the good. My kids can now run and play without me being worried. Everything is so clean all the time. The maintenance crew is so sweet and always ready to help.  Cristina is a very friendly but professional manager. This a very family oriented Apartment complex.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmapID>

<Text>Hello,
I am going into my third year living at the Grand Rose apartments and I love it!!!! The manager is very responsive, friendly, and always eager to assist. Also, I want to mention the maintenance staff was the same, friendly and helpful. When I moved in the apt. was clean and ready for me. The layout was perfect for me and my family. When I would send a maintenance request, it was always taken care of right away. I have lived in this area for years and never wrote a review ~ not that they didn't deserve one ~ but everything was just "ok". I give the highest rating to the Grand Rose apartments along with their staff. Great job everyone!!!< /Text>< pics>

< review>
Living here has been such an amazing time. The fact that there are no roaches , it is a very clean complex and the people are friendly. The laundry room is always very clean and opened 24 hours which is a very helpful thing. The only problem is that my kids always want to spend money at the vending machines with the snacks and drinks hahah. I would highly recommend this apartment complex to anyone because over all it is an amazing place.< /review>

The owner and management do an outstanding job creating a safe environment for young families. Not only are the improvements that theyve made to the community spaces beautiful but the units themselves are great too. Lots of storage. Another reason i love the unit is because there is no upstairs neighbors and the back patio is big enough for my kids to have an outdoor play house. The manager cristina makes it a priority to get to know the families and is super friendly.<//Review><user_name>Josue Cortez<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

And also its hard to fined people  that work like this and know how to make a well done job and know anything. And the owner of the property  is luck to have these workers.woooo.< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>the apartment are not huge but they are the best I have lived in. Never get bothered by anyone everyone is friendly. Gated and parking is not in issues if you have more than 1 car maybe but in all honestly how many people need 3 cars for one family? Management is amazing she is always willing to help and listen. Maintenance is great they are not speedy Gonzales you have to keep in mind there is more that one apartment and they do what they can and when it is urgent matters they are on top. So for all the complainers why are u really complaining you couldn’t pay so you go against the helping hand? Lol I love my home my kids do too and they are safe.

I wish there was a way to give negative stars! Literally the worst apartments EVER the parking is a HUGE NIGHTMARE. You’ll NEVER get anything fixed in your apartment or they brush it off and say they will fix it soon even though it’s been over a year! They constantly add ridiculous “fees” ! The trash is always a mess! This complex is terrible and needs to get it together! Worry more about making the place look friendly rather than making it look like prision and fix the parking situation you’ve been “working” on it for a “WHILE NOW” AND THERE IS NO PROGRESSION  !<//Text>

I’m going to be completely honest when I say that I never write reviews, especially not negative ones. However, this salon absolutely shocked me. Not only were they rude to my friend and I, but they are extremely expensive for the low quality manicure that you receive. Only come here if you plan on getting a pedicure and terrible attitudes. I got a full set of acrylics WITHOUT gel and it was $45! I asked the nail lady how much it was going to cost for the manicure two times and she yelled at me saying that I would “find out at the front table”. So I wasn’t surprised when they tried to rip me off and say it was $45. They then changed their mind after I already paid and said it was $40 and then handed me $5 back, which was pretty odd and unprofessional. I had tried my best to be nice to the lady doing my nails but every time I said something she would give me a dirty look. If you go to Jackson Nail, they only charge $25 for a full set, are extremely nice, and perform outstandingly in their work. For $20 less, you might as well go to Jackson Nail or really anywhere else but Martell Nails. I am writing this review 2 days after I got my nails done and both my friend and I already had two nails fall off and one of mine cracked. So please save yourself the money and time and don’t go here.</Review>

I tried the powder dip on my fingernails. Its expensive, $45. But they say its healthier and lasts a lot longer. My nails usually split with gel and dont even last 2 weeks.So I'll see how my nails do with the powder and if it does last longer I'll be back!< /Text></record>

First time getting a pedicure. I was just accompanying my wife because we had the time to do this.

I saw a lot of bad reviews, but I had no expectations either. The lady I had didn't speak English, but I wasn't there for a conversation.

It was enjoyable, but the seats were uncomfortable for me. However I do have a bad back and prolonged seating is uncomfortable. My wife loved the chairs. I would have really liked if they had a heating element to ease my discomfort.

All in all it was a good experience and my wife was satisfied as well.<//text>

<review>Had been using solan for a while prior without issue.... Made appointment 2 days before wedding day, (4/21/18) told manicurist to remove the nails I had on already, and do a gel ambrea with a specific color... didnt listen.... continued to tell her what i wanted, no change.... she didn't take the old ones off tried to do an ambrea with just the polish... all the while I'm telling her its wrong. After she was finished I told her AGAIN it was not what I wanted and wanted it redone.... ended up in a yelling match.... another woman came and attempted to fix my nails, came close but only excepted them because I was fed up with the whole thing... i was charged for 2 sets of nails.... AND 2 months later they charged me again saying "transactions processed during that week didnt post" even after showing proof the money came out of my account..... still took almost 2 months to get refund for the second charge. Yes its been 2 years, but thier service has not emproved.... everyday nail concerns i give them a 2.... anything specific 0 (my ONLY bridezilla moment was this)... haven't been back since, but family/friends have reported similar events. I would suggest the solan in the raleys parking lot....< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>I made appointment with Laura, and they said ok. I showed up for my appointment, and they said Laura had emergency so she'd just left. I asked my friend, and they said Laura no longer works at Martell nails anymore.  WHY YOU LIED TO CUSTOMER like this??? It took me 40 mins to show up there for my appointment, and my tech no longer worked here!!!!
FYI for someone looking for Laura, she's working at Organic Nail Lounge at Ione - 10 mins away from Jackson.

<Review>Way overpriced. They push you to upgrade and get really rude when you don't want to. Not to mention, I'm fairly certain my 6 year old niece could do a better job than they did. I reccomend going LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE.< /Review>< Resp>

Had the so called 40 min pedi. My daughter sitting next to me got a good one. My gal barely massaged my feet and legs.  She didnt get the cuticles she missed half of one hail with polish.when i asked her to fix it. She did but then on purpose messed up the one next to it.  I didn't notice till I was gone.<//review>

Expensive, cash is cheaper.  Kinda uncomfortable because my lady Hugh seemed grumpy and like she hated her job. I have had better pedicures but this one was “OK”
I’m going to look Around for a more friendly comfortable place<//text>

Pedicure was horrible. I paid close to 50 bucks and I still have a calluses on my feet. She use the pumice stone  just enough to make contact with my feet and that's it. The massage was just her moving her hands up and down my legs and feet really quickly.< /Review>

Stop with the hardcore up-sell! Also, despite it being illegal by consumer law,  they charge a different price (like 10% extra) to use your debit card.  Please just set a price and stop nickel and diming people.  Last time I'll go there.</review>

I've visited this Salon 3 times and as of the third on Saturday I will never go back. I've dealt with Phyllis on all three occasions and I could not be anymore surprised and offended by how rude and disrespectful she was this last time. The last visit I had to completely file down the entire new set she put on. Not bad for $50.00 right....WRONG. I decided to give this place a third chance and Have never been treated so badly. She couldn't even shape them all the same, when i asked her to fix them all she did was argue and she said it's my nails fault not her. Funny considering I've been getting my nails done for around 22 years and its never been a problem before. I forced her to stop after she sat there mumbling under her breath in her native language and giving my nasty looks (I paid her for what she do that will have to be COMPLETELY redone) and waited for my friend outside.
Do not waste your money. This place looks nice but their tools are dirty, their product is super cheap and They have HORRIBLE attitudes.</Text>

< Review>
When I first moved to the area I visited this nail place a few times. I felt like it was a bit over priced but had an ok experience. The last 2-3 times have been awful. I will NEVER come here again. They have some staff that are wonderful but I never seem to get them. My most recent experience was yesterday. My sister in law is in town and we went on for pedicures. We settled on the 45$ pedicures, though we felt those were pricey as is. We wanted gel as well and they wanted to tack on an additional 15!!! We decided to go with polish instead. We could tell this irritated the women doing our nails. I had gel on my toes from a previous pedicure though about 4 nails had nothing on them. She informed me that she would be charging me 5$ to remove the gel. I have never been charged for that... ever. She seemed annoyed at having to take the gel off of my toes and moved extremely slow. I have had gel taken off dozens of times and it can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes. It took her 20 minutes. My sister in laws pedicure was almost over by the time she started on mine. Kind of defeats the purpose of getting pedicures together. Anyway she was aggressive while cleaning my toes and actually hurt me. Lackluster massage and overall not worth one dollar I paid. After she was finished she did not let my toes dry AT ALL before she tried to put my sandals on. I told her I would prefer to wait a bit and she told me no 🙁. Pretty sure it should be my choice. I  begrudgingly let her attempt to put my sandals and and tried to help her along and she yelled at me “don’t help me! Just keep talking.” It was so rude I couldn’t believe it. She ended up messing up the polish on my pinky toe as well as the polish on my big toe but proceeded to act like it was my fault. Heavy sigh. This was the nail in the coffin. This place is over priced, poor quality and terrible customer service.<//Review>

New owner. Way different experience.
First off, they need to stop trying to talk you into how you want to pay.
Second, service was ok. Not what it used to be.
Third, they manipulated my 12 year old daughter in thier constant upsale effort....
They asked her if she wanted French manicure, after I told them color. She didn't understand what they were saying. Then they came to me, saying your daughter says she wants French manicure, $5.00 more.
They tried upselling the whole time.<//Text>

Horribly overpriced, they push upgrades really hard and they will not take a credit card. Also, don’t bother making an appointment because they will not care and make you wait. Rude staff and totally not worth it. I’ll never go back.<//Review>

I will never ever go here again if I could give this place zero stars I would. They lady I paid at the desk was rude and charged me $80 for something I didn't ask for and when I was explaining to her that I didn't want that she ripped the money out of my hand and said bye and put the money in the till< /text>

I used to go when it first opened and they weren't that great, so I stopped. I recently got a gift certificate there, so I went and got just some white tip acrylic nails and I haven't been there in a few years. They started to lift the very next day, one thumb was way longer than the other and within 3 days it's popped off. it's a $35 set that I only paid $15 for and that's not including the $5 tip I shouldn't have given. If it werent for the certificate I never would have gone, it was even more disappointing than I remembered.<//text>

Poor job on the pedicure (nail shaping to polish application), cheap polish brands (the quality is awful). It should've been half the price it was for what you get.<//Text>

But every time I visit this store, it feels like the air conditioner isn’t working properly. Wearing a mask, in the store, makes my face feel hot. I think the thermostat units need to be replaced because the digital thermostats are always at 72 degrees, even at high noon, it never changes on the temperate reading. Also, there is no public restroom available so don’t go there shopping after you drink a 24 or 36 ounce beverage!!!

My experience with donating items was inexplicably rude. Someone needs to step in and do some retraining to the staff accepting donations. Plenty of folks looking for work that may be able to do the job with, the bare minimum, a smile. Chasing donors away won’t help the organization. I understand it isn’t the easiest of jobs but that does not mean it’s okay to be rude. Perhaps these are volunteers who are overwhelmed?  If that’s the case, choose to volunteer elsewhere that you don’t have to deal with the public.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Love this store been coming here for 17 years if not more trust me this store is like No other .
Other thrift stores keep their stuff for weeks , even months not this one. Everyday is something different thats because they are removing the old stuff every Friday and out with the something different . Prices are great and if you feel the price is not for you just ask them for a fair price and they might work with you.
This place is clean well organized and staff friendly you are not just a customer you are family to them my kids rather come here then a amusement park 😂</text>< pics>

I love this store! Prices are great, staff is great, and selection is aplenty! Nice, affordable thrift store. The only reason they got 4 stars instead of 5, is because they're not open now that restrictions have been lifted for them. I miss shopping there. Great store!<//review>

<review>There is a guy who lives in Calimesa who (whom) I have known for 33 years. I hadn't seen him in 28 years, but social media helped us to get back in touch. Me and the Wife drove from Anaheim to Calimesa to spend an afternoon with an old buddy and his fiance.

They took us out to show us the local sights. We had breakfast at Clarkie's, then before getting library cards at the local branch (why not?!) we found ourselves at this thrift shop.

Maybe it was the beers I shotgunned in the vacant field next door before coming in, but that visit was the most fun I had ever had at any thrift store anywhere. Ever.

The four of us were joking and messing around while we browsed. The other customers and the cashiers joked right along with us. Everybody was in a good mood and friendly. Great customer service.

Pro tip (I only went there once and it was only for about 30 minutes, but, yes - I'm a "pro"!): There is a secret room located on the other side of that doorway without a door at the back wall of the store. There is more stuff in that room. I found a Japanese drum like the ones in Karate Kid 2 back there.

That drum was pretty sweet.</review>< rating>

<review>I enjoy shopping there for the most part but I'm noticing men and women clothes put in the wrong places, men's in the women's clothing and vice versa plus the prices are going up maybe a little too much for a thrift/ used.</review>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Mike Is a great guy. If you need a phone repair I would definitely recommend heading over to RepairAll. The price for the repair may be a little more, but nothing beats having great customer service that you can trust if you end up finding a button or something goes out after the repair. Not that common these days to find that in a business.< /Review><user>109152090267724355420</user>< response>

A few hours later my phone completely shut down and started going in and out of re-boot. I tried everything I found online like hard-reset and even updated by connecting to iTunes. No-luck, iTunes was trying to force me to do a factory reset. This wasn’t an option for me because I would lose all my work on my phone. I started searching Yelp for a phone repair.... it was Saturday night and 9/10 spots were closed the following day (Sunday) but not repair all. I requested a quote through Yelp and got a response within 5 minutes to bring the phone in the following day on Sunday @11am to their Manteca branch. I dropped off my phone wotofo Leticia and she took care of it for me. She opened my phone and repaired the water damage. My phone is good as new and she charged me only $50 for it. Thank you for the wonderful service.</text><rate>5<//rate><pics>None</pics><user>105872650853054453566< /user><Date>1623617662225< /Date>< user_name>

<Text>I went here because of there rating and wasn’t disappointed. I had just went somewhere else ( manteca computer services) and had some faulty screen replacement that ended up frying my motherboard and top it all off screen didn’t work properly.... So I explained my concern and frustration and the young lady here assured me she could fix and she had it fixed in 30 min unlike other place that took a week also said I would have a year warranty on the screen, so super happy wish I would have went there to begin with<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>So my phone got stepped on and my phone stopped working completely, first it was a blur then it would not turn back on. It was my first time taking it in and the customer service Greg provided was absolutely great! I thought it was going to take a while to get my phone fixed but it ONLY took 30 minutes and the price was reasonable! He did forget to give back my screen protector back because he had to leave as soon as my phone was fixed due to a family emergency ☹️ But overall, I would highly recommend this place if anything happens to your electronics.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Called 45 minutes before they closed, Luis assured me he could replace the screen on my granddaughter's iPhone 7 if we could get there soon. Now 20 minutes later we were there and it's Luis replaced the screen and the world was perfect once again. We've dealt with a lot of repair stores, this was by far the most efficient and affordable, we will be back!!!<//review><user_name>Gramps Lee<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>A couple weeks ago on Friday I brought my laptop with a replacement battery to be picked up the next day.  Prior to closing I received a call informing me that I had the incorrect battery and the technician provided me with specifics from the battery in my laptop, which I was able to look-up on Amazon. A week later the correct replacement came so I returned with my laptop and was able to pick it up Saturday afternoon. I appreciate the quick turnaround, I’ve noticed an improvement over the past few days.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely loved the customer service and the speedy repair. Claudia made sure I did not leave without a good protector case and screen protector. whatever questions i did have she was able to answer them. She even went above and beyond to help us in our time of need. I highly recommend this repair shop.<//Review>

<text>Bryan was great, service was perfect some of these reviews on here are horrible, if your device is non function when you take it in, liability is on you if something is not working. Bryan quoted me over the phone for a screen and battery replacement on my iPhone, he was able to get me in right away, he kept me updated along the way which I thought was nice, phone was repaired and I had it back in a few hours, he even gave me a discount for replacing both items at the same time. Their policies are written out in the shop, as is their warranty, read it. I’ve already recommended this place to a few people.< /text>< pics>

I was so excited to find my screen was not broken, but just the tempered glass screen protector I had bought here a few months ago.  I was so happy, I bought a screen protector for that phone and for another family member.  Claudia was superb in service and professionalism!< /Text>

<name>Vincent Harrell</name><review>Brought my phone in to get the charging port fixed. My screen worked just fine. When I went to pick it up the screen was broke. The guy working said since the phone was dead when I brought it in we couldn’t do pre tests to make sure the screen wasn’t broke they wouldn’t replace it. I know for a fact the LED part of my screen was just fine along with the outer part of my screen. He offered a discount on the screen even though he “didn’t break it.” I would recommend going somewhere else because who knows how many things they  “didn’t break” then offer to fix for a small discount later.<//review>< rate>

Phone screen is acting up and having a hard time responding to touch. Sometimes it will be fine but then it won’t let me press my screen and use my phone. I never had this problem until I got it fixed and it’s messing with my day-to-day usage. Even just typing this message it is causing me to constantly go back and fix what I have typed because it is not typing some of the letters. I even reset my phone thinking that would help but it didn’t. I am Very disappointed with the service, not worth the money spent on it.<//Review>

<Review>I recently dropped my iPhone & cracked the screen—again! Having done this two previous times, I was well acquainted with the process of having the screen replaced. I was pleased to find RepairALL within 10 min. of my home instead of having to drive to the next larger town. Not only was it convenient, the repair gentleman was delightful/knowledgeable and quickly replaced my screen (& case) for a very reasonable price! I am pleased to give RepairALL my highest recommendation!!</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The staff are very helpful and friendly. One employee, I believe his name is Ke’Shaun, replaced my phone screen in a matter of minutes and explained the process as he took it apart. They also have a pretty nice selection of cases and accessories. I definitely recommend RepairAll to anyone who needs phone repair!< /text>

<Text>First visit they were courteous,  fast service, affordable prices

Had a second visit to have a tablet fixed. Parts had to be ordered. It took to two phone calls and a visit to find out after 4 weeks that the parts were never ordered. After a total of six weeks to get it back.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Went in for warranty claim because the screen on my iPhone was acting up after a few months when they replaced it. I was promised that it was under warranty and will be replacing for free. Came back 45 minutes later to check on the status then Keshawn told me that my screen had a big scratch which was not there before I gave him my iPhone so he said that the warranty is void. (ended up paying $83 for a new replacement screen) on top of that I was never given a receipt because he claimed that he ran out of ink on his printer. Really? What kind of business are you running here?! I will never ever go back to this place ever again because they don’t treat their returning customer right!</text>

RepairALL is a great place to get your phone fixed. I’ve been twice, I’m a vip member so I get discounts sent to my phone often. It’s nice to see they care and send discounts. I’ll continue to come here for my iPhone repairs. Their fast as well!<//Text>

Nice place. Looks like they have every type of case and screen protector that one would need.</review>

Great customer service and very fast. The gentleman who helped me was very nice and gave me realistic times for my phone part to come in and for repair. I hope I don't break my phone camera lens again but if I do, I'll be bringing it back to RepairAll to have fixed because of their great service< /review>

My last visit for a repair was positive. The technician was very responsive and went the extra mile to  make adjustments that did not even concern my main issue. I left feeling confident that my phone was repaired and was actually working better than when I went in. This technician was a young female and I don’t remember her name but I highly recommend her.  She worked quickly, proficiently, and seem to truly care about what she was doing.</text>

Great, friendly service.  And with expensive high tech devices, it is good to know that they are skilled.  My repair required soldering tiny connections and they did it well.  Kept me updated during the process and charged me very fairly.  This is now my go to repair center.</text>

I thought I needed to replace the charging port on my iphone. Greg  could have done that.  But he was honest and told me it only needed to be cleaned, which he did at no charge.  I wanted to buy something to say thanks and help keep this business growing.  So I bought a charging cable!!! Thanks Greg!!  I'll be back!< /Review>

I thought I would have to get a whole new phone after I dropped mine this last time. I called around to get quotes on my phone and found out that RepairAll was the only repair store to offer a free diagnosis in the area. So I took my IPhone 6 to RepairAll  the next day as soon as the store opened. I could tell that Gregory knew what he was doing because he fixed it within 15 minutes!

<review>Myra is a genius. she took what I was under the impression to be a total loss (iPhone 6s plus) that was cracked, frame bent, LCD screen looked like a colorful inkblot, with water mixed in, and in about 35 minutes returned to me a brand new phone. I cannot say this enough this place is awesome! For those of you who dont have insurance on your devices, and cant afford the 900+$ to replace it, Go to repair all! Talk to MYRA shes amazingly talented and super helpful and polite. 100% in customer service!< /review><time>1553446837253</time><UserId.>113918985210424028781< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Honestly, now I won't go anywhere else. My phone screen completely shattered on the kitchen floor. I called on a whim and I couldn't ask for more! Excellent customer service, affordable prices, super helpful and got my phone fixed in minutes! I definitely recommend!!<//Text>

I had talked to someone two days prior to coming in to get my screen fixed and was offered a good deal, called after a few days talked to someone new and asked about what the other guy had offered and he said he would honor it, I thought that was pretty awesome! Super fast, only took 20 minutes to fix and not super expensive like other places! Very nice as well. Highly recommend my screen looks good as new!!</text>

The store is super clean & organized - they're always available & ready to assist. Repair costs very reasonable and are completed in a timely matter.  This is the part that sets RepairALL above it's competition - no matter if they get my business or not, I know Greg & staff will guide me into the correct direction.</review>

My IPhone went for swim for about an hour and a half. Got a new phone, however, I saw this store next to the AT&T store and thought I will let them look at the damaged phone. Free estimate with 30 minutes and 2 hours later my phone was fixed. Just restored the software at home and the thing worked perfectly. I wouldn’t of bought a new phone if I talked to these guys first. Also couldn’t ask better professionalism.<//Review>

<review>2nd time in for service. Yes, I dropped it AGAIN.
I cannot say enough for their business and service,
Honestly!
Last time in I purchased a new screen. I was told a screen protector could save my screen from cracking, so I had them put one on.
When I dropped my phone, I could see the glass was shattered.
I brought it in to have the glass replaced and when the gentleman removed the screen protector, I was shocked. For once, I had been sold something that actually worked. I had a new screen protector placed and my phone is like new again.
I would recommend this company to all. You will not be disappointed.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1535047930409, 'text': "Thank you for the review!

The young man that helped me seemed to be very knowledgeable and customer oriented. I was extremely happy with the outcome of my visit. He met and exceeded my needs. I would highly recommend and certainly will return.</Text>

< review>
Really great customer service! I messaged Repair All Phone Repair and another local phone repair shop through the maps app with my phone info and what I needed fixed. Repair All promptly replied within 30 minutes with a quote and also notified me that the part would have to be ordered. The other place read my message, but never answered. So I went in store to Repair All and paid, about a week later I got a text saying my part was in. I called and asked if they had time to fix it now. Dropped it off and an hour later was ready to go. Employee even left the protective plastic on there, and left it up to me if I wanted to take it off or leave it on, which is a nice gesture in my opinion because I know some people who do like to leave it on. Basically, I would DEFINITELY recommend that you go here for any phone repairs.</review>

They were friendly and nice. I went in to replace a screen for an iPad Air first generation. Cost me $90 with a lifetime warranty. I happily paid it. Dropped it off and picked it up the next day. I will definitely go to them again.</text>

I am a repeat customer and I will continue to use this repair shop for all my electronics. I needed a screen replaced on my iPhone 6. Repaired while I waited and with the coupon the cost was $30 less than batteries plus. Recently had another phone fixed and was given a generous discount for an inconvenience caused by a new employee. This shop stands behind their customers with courtesy and great service, I would recommend this shop to everyone.</review>< Rating>

I found RepairAll online with great reviews and I walked in with an iPhone nightmare- multiple broken phones that all decided to have problems at the same time. I picked up my working phones an hour later and they are as good as new! The price was great too. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anybody that needs repairs done. I wish I had found them a long time ago!</review>

The screen on my iPhone 6 was severely broken with dark lines going on the side of the screen, making it impossible to see or use the right side of the keyboard.

I definitely recommend this place! I just got my phone fixed today by Greg. He finished in less than an hour and the price is so worth it. I called other shops that were charging me a ridiculous price but this place is reasonable and  Definitely your pennies worth (:</review>

Took iPhone 6s in to get a new battery. Left with phone and realized when I got home that it wasn’t charging properly. Couldn’t go back until next day. Store did not have another battery. I was told delivery would be in about 2 and to call back at 2:30. I called at 3 and was told, oh yes it’s here, I’ll get right to it. 5 minutes later I received a call that this battery was bad also. The manager drove from Manteca store to Modesto store and got another battery. I finally got my iPhone back with a good battery installed at 7:00pm. Manager was very apologetic and made extra effort to get me my phone back. Maybe they need to change their source of batteries.< /Review>

I shattered my IPhone 7 Plus screen completely. I came in to repairALL mid day on a Friday and he told me it would take 40 minutes to replace the screen. It was done 40 minutes later. Same cost as taking it to the apple store but way faster and more convenient. No hassle.<//Review>

I shattered my IPhone 7 Plus screen completely. I came in to repairALL mid day on a Friday and he told me it would take 40 minutes to replace the screen. It was done 40 minutes later. Same cost as taking it to the apple store but way faster and more convenient. No hassle.</text>

<Text>I broke my phone screen and use my phone for business and needed to get it fixed. I went to RepairAll in Manteca on Hulsey road and they fixed it within minutes! I also invested in a fireproof case for better better protection and they gave me a great discount on the case and $10 off for signing up on their rewards program! They were great and I’d strongly recommend the guys at RepairAll!

I broke my iPhone screen and wasn’t sure if there was more damage because before the screen cracked all the way my phone glitched out terribly, so today after my daughters soccer game I went to this location to get a quote and after speaking to the technician he told me that they could do a free diagnostic which was great because I wasn’t sure if I need a new phone or just a new screen. The diagnostic was done in less than 10 minutes and it turned out I just needed a new screen (great news) so I was in and out within 30 minutes which is notable because I couldn’t get an appointment with Apple until a week and a half from today! The technician was super friendly and made the whole experience wonderful from beginning to end..the apple store is good at what they do BUT as far as expedited repairs and customer service they are lacking.  I will be taking our phones here from now on not just based on that but the price as well!  I don’t always leave reviews but when I do it’s because the service was above and beyond or extremely lacking in quality and I’m happy to say that this was a great experience and have already told family and friends about it!
-thank you again!<//review>

Going to Repairall in Manteca was
a great experience. Greg, the store
Manager, is a very personable and
Knowledgeable representative who
repaired my antiquated 5 iPhone
with 30 minutes, after advised by
my carrier to just get a new phone.

Well great customer service never
never goes out of style and I highly
recommend the repair service of
Repairall</review>

Went in, and 30 minutes later my broken screen was replaced and I was all fixed. Friendly guy, he made it easy. Cheaper than Asurian and faster. I should have gone RepairAll when my charge port gave out. I would have saved money.<//text>

I stopped into Repair All to see about replacing the battery in an iPhone 5. Ten minutes later the problem was fixed and I was on my way. The service was excellent and much less expensive than replacing the phone.< /Text>

<Text>I waited 2 hours to jus be told my daughters phone had a touch disease, meanwhile at least 5 other people came into the store an the young man working alone was unable to fix any of the phones, I personally feel he doesn't know what he's doin an should receive more training, I'm quite upset I wasted that much time, for him to tell me to contact apple, very disappointing, if the staff isn't trained properly this business we be closed down in no time..</Text>< Rating>

Came into this store so upset because I thought I had lost all my pictures of my kids because my phone got thrown in the toilet , I thought my phone was done for but Gregory was able to fix it and save all my precious memories of my children ! Can’t thank him enough, and will definitely be back again!!<//review>
