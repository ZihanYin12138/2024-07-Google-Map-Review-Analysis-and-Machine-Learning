I have always loved this store because of their unique merchandise by local artists or businesses. Not to mention I’m a huge supporter of local Long Beach stores and rarely shop at bigger or mainstream places. The staff is usually very friendly and outgoing. However, today that was not the case and I won’t be back, ever. The older gentleman that was there was unkind and just plain rude! I literally asked 2 questions and he made me feel like I was bothering him. I walk to the register to pay for my item and again just so unkind and the only thing he said during the transaction was my total and “take your card out” he then walked away abruptly! That’s it! He didn’t even look at me or say a simple “thank you”... “would u like a receipt?” or “have a nice day” Just walked away... smh.
It’s just bad business and flat out rude AF! So take your hard earned money elsewhere! It’s sad that Made has this grumpy old man working there. There is no reason for people to be treated this way when supporting a business. There is never anyone in there, maybe he is the reason?!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This place absolutely fantastic for buying local Long Beach gifts for friends or for yourself.

They have lots of One Of A Kind items, most of which are handmade by local residents. There are a lot of Long Beach themed items as well, so this is the perfect spot for unique souvenirs.

The staff here are friendly and helpful.

The store is very interested in everything local, hosting events supporting the neighborhood, art exhibits about Long Beach. Some other fun stuff as well.

This place is well worth a pit stop while you are visiting Long Beach.<//Review><UserId.>115935470550642368694< /UserId.>< response>

Great store for gifts and cards, pretty good for locally thrown ceramic plates and bowls. A little overpriced but that comes with the territory of supporting local artists. There's better coffee in LB than the stuff they sell there, though.</Review>

<Name>Christopher Jacob<//Name><Time>1431024567197<//Time><Rating>4</Rating><Text>Very nice little shop in downtown LB. The retail space is packed with local-made products ranging from handbags to pickled peppers! It's a fantastic place to pick up a gift for that special someone, or if you want to grab some premium goodies to support your local makers! I have my eye on their locally roasted coffee and hot sauce selection, but they also have soaps, candles, stationary and much more.

My only negative would be some of the prices were a bit ridiculous. I understand you get what you pay for, and honestly its worth it to know the money is going to some creative folks living in the city, however some tags were just gasp worthy! (Example: a small bag made of recycled material about a foot long by 8" high was priced at approx $250!! It was a nice bag, but not THAT nice!!)

I hope this shop stays open for a long time, its things like this that encourage folks to make their own goodies and sell to their community. Its an awesome idea with a beautiful execution.</Text>< Pics>

This place could easily be seen as the heart of Long Beach; everything sold inside is made by potential (or newly introduced) small business owners. Chocolate, pies in jars, hand made candles, leather goods and jewelry, Long Beach printed clothing and more!< /Text>

MADE is a super cool shop servicing downtown Long Beach by carrying local makers of all sorts: jewelry, clothing, housewares, ceramics, doggie stuff, accessories, furniture, and lots of edibles like chocolate, sauces, teas/coffees, and more!

Downtown LB is small but mighty. The East Village has a small amount of local shoppery, but that's about it. MADE almost suffered the fate of many businesses that attempt to make it on Pine but with some creative and loving business dealings seems like it is putting down roots and will become a staple of DTLB.

The large space also hosts many community events like art shows, holiday parties, readings, polling, monthly/weekly pop-ups, and a lot of other creative and cool reasons to drop in.< /review>

<text>I participated in a crowdfunding program for them, which said contributors at my level would receive a wooden map of Long Beach in October 2015. I understand with crowdfunding programs you may not always get the final product, but October 2015 rolled around and there were no updates. I contacted them several times and finally got a response in January. Then, a month ago, I received an email that the maps were ready and mine would be shipped out by April 20. Almost 4 weeks later...nothing. I've emailed DW Ferrell, called the store, posted on Facebook...no response to my request that they confirm the address it was shipped to and provide me with a tracking number. Needless to say, their customer service is horrible.</text>< pics>

We stopped here during our self guided hike tour & the customer service was amazing! My favourite part was the wine tasting at the tasting bar which was just $10 for 5 different wines! I also loved my salted caramel with nuts ice cream. Very rich & appropriate after a long bike ride. The only downside was my spinach ravioli. There was barely any seasoning or flavouring. We went here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn’t even packed. Made it the perfect pit stop. We ended up covering it in pepper to make it taste better. Other than the ravioli, everything was great!< /review>

The offerings of this store are awesome, the coffee is top notch. The wine shop has a great selection of local wines. Everytime I go there they have a great selection of gifts & unique items. I love the greeting cards they have as well, very dry humor. The last time I was getting coffee, the young lady making my coffee was so friendly & genuine her name was Hannah. Another great thing to get there are their sandwiches & a great drink selection. I can't wait to see what they have on my next visit...❤❤❤❤< /Review>

Discovered this local hot spot last year. We enjoyed the wine tasting so much that we joined the wine club. We stopped by yesterday with some friends and met Todd the owner. He is a super nice guy and his staff are always so friendly.<//Review>

His wine selections are fantastic and the notes he provides for each bottle are invaluable. It is clear that Todd takes the time to carefully review and select bottles, rather than simply throwing random bottles together. If someone wants to enjoy the best wines in Sonoma and from the Old World, I would highly recommend getting in touch with Todd.</text>< pics>

The best quick stop for coffee, a sandwich, gelato, fabulous french bread, pastries, just about anything you'd need. Also a fabulous wine bar. It's a fun & convenient spot, recommended highly.< /text>

The food was great and the service was great as well. No major complaints at all. Would suggest that with the amount of drinks sold in glass bottles they should place bottle openers on or near the tables.< /review>

We prefer Sonoma’s Best Wine Club to any single vineyard because of the amazing selection of thoughtfully-curated local and international wines. The tasting room is more like a bar (you can get a full pour versus tiny taste) with friendly, laid-back atmosphere filled with fun, interesting locals. The adjacent cafe is also delicious. All of the staff is great—shout out to Todd, Myron, and Joanne for always making us feel welcome.<//review>

Lovely stop to make during our drive in the Sonoma Vslley.  Great food and deli. Didn’t try wine tasting but looked very promising too.</review>

The gift shop is interestingly good, I check prices of anything that appeals to me and I always find something that is priced very low for it's value, the rest medium to high.< /text>

If you are looking for artesian products, most locally made, with a cool comfortable vibe, then stop here.

It’s perfect for a picnic, to get your rations, from cheeses, meats, spreads, crackers, to a bakery, espresso, to a deli for salads, sandwiches and drinks. They offer a large selection of unique wines as well.</Review>

This was the cutest one stop shop. Deli, ice cream/ gelato parlor, small wine tasting room and Espresso Bar all in one. It's has a little but of everything. Will definitely make it a place to stop on all my trips to wine country.<//Review>

Only came here for the food. Some of the things we're obviously microwaved frozen foods that were quickly prepared. Sandwiches that were made seemed like an afterthought. Lines weren't particularly long, but was very slow, followed by an even slower wait to actually get the food to your table. Can't speak to the stay and rooms, but I would not recommend the food.< /text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I was quite disappointed with the service here.  We ordered sandwiches to go and it took about an hour to get our food because they mixed up the order of the tickets.  We noticed that all the parties who came in after us were happily enjoying their meals and we asked when our order was going to be ready and they responded "yours is next" without even checking our ticket.  We proceeded to wait and then inquired another time about our orders and they finally started making them (after waiting almost an hour).  When we addressed the wait time with them, they didn't apologize - the server who took our order actually rolled her eyes at us.  The sandwiches were delicious but I don't think I would return based on the wait time.  We actually missed a scheduled wine tasting because we were waiting for so long and the sandwiches were quite expensive.  They were tasty, but there are plenty of places who will make a delicious sandwich in less time and with better customer service.< /review>< Pictures>

We just arrived at our Sonoma's Best Cottage and its adorable, classy and comfortable! Laura was great and even helped us out with a girls day of relaxation in town. We were greated with a great selection of wine and cheeses as well as a perfectly temperature controlled room. Access after hours was a breeze. We will be back!</Text>

<review>Cozy, but vibrant. Wine tasting with sports on the teli ( you can also enjoy a beer). Wonderful little deli with cold salads a wide of cold drinks to accommodate most tastes. For me I had the Sonoma Veggie sandwich ( see pic). They also have a full coffee bar. Located at East Napa st & Eight St just a bit outside the town square. Friendly staff full of energy and smiles.

Indoor & outdoor seating
Services animals allowed
Handicapped accessible
There is a ramp to the outside patio as well as seating at the bar for wine tasting.

You can sit in comfort enjoy great wine, feed your soul with good conversation and take care of that rumbling tummy.

Perfect place to stay in Sonoma. Cottage with a kitchen, a store with breakfast and picnic fair out front for the day, and a "locals favorite" wine bar in the afternoon to get the lay of the land and have the perfect happy hour.  The manager, Todd, had An amazing selection of wines from the region and the world. All within walking distance of downtown Sonoma.< /review>

Just stopped in for an Americano. Barista asked if I wanted room for cream. I asked for room for cool water instead. She put the water in for me and it was perfect, not too hot and not too cool. Awesome tasting coffee as well. We now have a new pit stop and place to stay. Deli looked delish as well.</review>

Great spot for sandwiches, pastries, coffee, and wines. You can eat inside, out front, or in back in the garden. Take away is quite convenient if you're on your way to a winery like Buena Vista!< /text>

<Text>Smoked pork bbq special was incredibly tender; sauce was excellent too. Nice little touches like horseradish in the cole slaw and mustard seeds in the cabbage. They also have a la carte, olive oil tasting, cheese samples, wine, and they sell art. Lots of friendly people inside, both customers and workers. Will definitely be back.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Ate here earlier today. My dad and I had a weekly lunch date at Arbys but they wont even let you order at counter to take out. What a joy to eat a sit in lunch with my 92 year old #ad. They were the perfect blend of aware of covid and practical but not fearful or paranoid. Cashiers were awesome friendly and my Western bacon cheeseburger was so nice after a year. Thank you Carls Jr!!<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<review>Food quality was very good. Hot and fresh. Prices are a little high though. 4 burgers and two large fries for $33?! At least the food and service were good.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>Had a very bad experience here. The order was wrong, missing items, even checking the order at home, the items we did receive were not correct. One prime rib burger was completely without any prime rib. We asked and paid for for extra cheese and could barely even see the cheese, and the fries were less than half full. Worst experience I've ever had at  Carl's Jr.</Review>< pics>

<Review>This restaurant is my favorite Carl’s to go to! The employees are very friendly and the manager as well. I had a very big order one day and they came to my out to help me. If you’re in the area and hungry, definitely check this place out!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This place is awful! They never get an order right. I ordered two big chicken sandwiches equaling $13.00. Get home and there’s chicken fingers in there. I would say next time I would check my order. But I will never go here again , Or any other Carl’s Jr.’s for that matter</Text>

<text>First off I just want to say it's Carl's jr. I like their food their hamburgers are great they have the best chicken tenders. This is not my normal Carl's Junior but it happens to be on our way home from my nephew's work so we stop there every now and then just this past week though they did leave something out of my order so by time I went home and then drove back I was a little upset however their manager made good on my order and went Way Beyond. He's not only make sure that I got my complete order he remade my hamburgers that were cold and also credit me for my order because of their good service they have me as a loyal customer. Good customer service and good food way to go Carl's Junior love you guys</text>< Time>

<review>Just purchased the double large burger at drive thru, requested specifically for it to be VERY hot. After it was delivered to my car, server with no gloves ( I have a very compromised immune system) I went home to eat. Once I opened I found it to be a single and COLD. I threw it away.
Tried calling but got a fax signal.
I will NEVER  support them again! May 11th 2020< /review></record></dataset><record>

"Screwed in the drive-thru"
Ordered and PAID for Zucchini only to find out we got regular fries when we got home. Receipt even confirmed Zucchini. Very disappointed. This location is going on our 'no-fly' list for a while.

If you order ANYTHING special, you should check your FULL order before leaving otherwise you too risk being "Screwed in the drive-thru"!!< /Text>

The restaurant is very clean the food is good but the price is bad. Unfortunately this is a franchise. So expect prices to be around $2 more PER ITEM. The ketchup is also behind the counter they are stingy about it also. I recommend going to a different one.<//Text>

< Review>
The BEYOND BURGER IS INSAIN, WHY ITS $2 MORE THAN REAL MEAT, IS WAY BEYOND ME, ITS ACTUALLY NOT FAIR, THAT SOMETHING FABRICATED  IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN COW FLESH.

BUT ANYHOW , IT IS AMAZING, GOOD JOB TO CARL'S JR FOR BEING  THE FIRST FRANCHISE TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO LAUNCH A MEAT TASTING FAKE BURGER.

Just make it cheaper !< /Review>

I haven't had burgers for a long time now but I believe their burgers are quite tasty. Very delicious and meaty. Unlike McDonald's burger that tastes bland and feels old . Yummy!!</Review>

Great service from the lady in the drive thru - Her name if I recall is Guadalupe - What an asset to this location. Very pleasant and thoughtful.

The food is solid, I only go here for the Beyond Famous Star. Finally a legit Vegan/Vegetarian offering has brought me back as a customer of Carls Jr after 8 years.</review>

The food was very good.   I came in for a salad.  I asked the man behind the counter what kind of lettuce was in the salad.  He said it was Romain.  I like Romain lettuce,  so I ordered it.   When it was delivered to my table,  the lettuce turned out to be Iceberg lettuce,  which research shows to be the worst quality lettuce on the market.  I returned it and was offered anything on the menu in exchange.  I was well taken of for the rest of my meal.  I will go there again.<//Text>

We used to have romaine lettuce mix, but Carl's Jr. corporate changed the salad recipe about 6 months ago.  Now we just use Iceberg Lettuce as you stated.  I am glad our crew replaced your meal and took care of you professionally.  We hope to see you back again soon."}< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>I still believe that the Carl's Jr original 6 dollar burger is one of the best burger deals available. With a coupon they are 2 for $6. Ask for jalapenos if you like spicy and they will add them no charge. I would give them 5 stars but the service is not so great and every table in the restaurant was dirty. Understaffed. Burgers are great!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1520023357512, 'text': 'Thank you for the feedback'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Look it's Carl's Jr. I'm not going to go all "Yelp", however they do deserve my 5*.

Let me tell you why these guys are 5 star.

This is the best service and food I've gotten across the nation at a Carl's Jr., whether it be out of state here on the West coast, or on the East coast at the Hardee's version. The best.

The food has been made fresh every time. Because of this, you guys have been stealing my business that would typically go to a Wendy's.

The friendliness of employees has been top notch. Two separate times now. The first time I went out of my way to tell the manager great job on my burger and fries. The gentlemen tonight was literally running to help me. Super polite.

Now the food. I've been eating the protein burger here. You guys make the best protein burger out there. Only habit gets close. In and out can't touch this burger.

Thank you for rocking it guys. Loving the new updated menus too.</review>< pics>

Tried again this year while my husband was ordering, he couldn't get a word in, the guy taking the order kept cutting him off, guessing wrong what we were trying to order, then right when we finally ordered, every item received was wrong... right down to the drink... just done with this place.

Last year: Meal wasnt so good today, the worst was the onion rings, there was so much friggin salt on them I took one bite and spit it out then just threw them away. Waste of money.<//Review>

A good burger place and recently renovated with nice seating and stylish look. A little disappointed with the new set that they removed the TVs showing live sports or news that people can enjoy.  Last week and now the Veggie burger that has just bread with lettuce, tomato and onions with sauce now costs 2.49 + tax. Used to be  $1.30 . What a ripoff and the order taking personal was so rude. Never going again.< /Text>

Went through the drive through, was told to park out front and wait for our food. 15 minutes later we went inside to see what was going on. They hadn’t even started our food. The restaurant wasn’t busy, they were pitifully understaffed. The girl who took our drive through order left while we were parked out front. I will never return to this joke of a Carl’s. Would give 0 stars if I could.<//text>

The manager wasn't kidding. 10stars worth of juicy burger! I've been having Carl's Jr since I was 1. I am 35 now and still in love with the food and service at Carl's Jr.</Review>

I know it's just fast food and I shouldn't set very high expectations, but the bun on my chicken sandwich was soggy and I ate at the restaurant, it's not like it sat in the bag for awhile.< /text>

It's a lot of food and they cook their own beans, pretty awesome. Giving 4 starts because their salad could be better</review>

This a location in Salinas that the business has changed hands over the years but the style of the food hasn't changed much good food and I believe that it is owned by the same people that own Ticos Tacos , I am a longtime resident of Salinas so i still call this place Pepe Taco which is what it was when i was a kid.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The salad is very ugly, the taste of the chicken is good but very dry I think it has been stored for a long time, the attention compensates a bit.

Still doing curbside.  A bit pricey.  But, they are there.  Go through many different vets since the practice went corporate.</text>

< Review>
Great place with caring people, whether it's keeping your pets healthy or helping you say goodbye to a sick pet (we've done both). Always honest and up front about any costs for care before services are performed. You can request an appointment or ask a question online and someone will call you back promptly.  They're open 7 days a week, so I never have trouble finding an appointment that fits my schedule.  If you adopt from SD Humane, they honor the vet visit coupon that comes with your adoption.  I highly recommend this veterinary office.< /Review>

They ended up being a sister location to our old vet, which we loved, but was too far away for regular care. Multiple visits, multiple issues with the kitten. They’ve been our vet since. They’re always professional, kind when my other cat needed end of life care.

It’s been a few years now. Staff is kind, I never worry about my pets in their care.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>These guys care tremendously and I really loved having them as my vet. Came in with my little guy and he had pustules all in his ears and mouth, he also had a pretty high fever. They didn't recognize what it was initially but they put him on an antibiotic regime that helped pretty quickly, then they did a biopsy and a culture and it came back as Staph. Weirdest way I've ever seen Staph present. It came back a little about a week or so later so they just had me give him a higher dose of the antibiotic he was on and it worked. Thank you guys for saving my boy.< /Review>< pictures>

1st time she's met my furbaby Bowie .
He absolutely DOESNT LIKE TO BE PICKED UP.
This sweet Dr Dog Whisperer carried Bowie outside so he wouldn't pull & get out of his harness.
She prescribed  itch Medicare. Hes tearing himself up in this heat. Definitely he's getting better.
Thank you everyone @ SDPH

<review>Took my Dog here on 19 Mar 2021. Technician had an attitude from the start. Didn’t allow my dog to sniff her to feel comfortable didn’t acknowledge her by name just grabbed her with the rope and dragged her away. Definitely not how you approach any pet. “Veterinary care from the heart” I doubt it very much. Won’t be coming back here at all. Don’t come here unless you want your dog treated like dirt</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80d9512cb18cbcb7:0x17af3b075e953de2</GmapID></record>

I’ve been taking my dog here for years and she has been seen for various things, some routine and some verging on emergencies. I’ve dealt with numerous staff and the running thread through it all is professionalism. The level of care and dedication, not only to each pet individually but to animal healthcare in general floors me. Take any negative review with a grain (or shaker) of salt bc I’m here to tell you that your pet is in good hands here.</text>

I found them to be way overpriced, and they seemed to be trying to upsell us.  I'm so glad I shopped around and asked friends for references.  I have a lot more trust in our new vet.  These guys kept suggesting worst case scenarios that were really a reach, and pressured us to spend on extra costs.<//Review>

I had to say farewell to my sweet kitty today. I am so grateful for the way Dr Wilcox and the staff handled the situation. I left feeling I had made the right decision and the procedure was gentle and peaceful. They were very caring and compassionate. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this facility.

EDIT: I received a wonderful sympathy card from the staff. What a nice thing. Thank you!</Text>

I wish I would have got the name of the girl I spoke with this morning June 29, 2020 at 10am. Her service was unhelpful and unprofessional. Wasn’t sure if her workplace might of been stressful or just having a bad day but whatever her problem was effected her service. I called about my year old cat. I wanted to make a wellness check up appointment because the previous day he acted a little off and I thought maybe he ate something bad. Only helped she wanted to provide was reference number to another pet vet, I didn’t feel it necessary when I was already on the phone scheduling an appointment  for Friday July 3, 2020 with her. Towards the end of call we discussed my cats previous Health  records I told her I had got him thru a family friend and I have very little documentation of his past. She said that if I were to bring him in he would have to get a rabies shot since I had little proof of his past health records. I did let her know before he came into my hands they had given him all of his needed shots and was neutered and the only documentation I have is a tiny paper with his weight his color and the shots they provided. She seemed unimpressed and over it at that point. I did let her know that I understand these times are stressful but it was her attitude that was definitely the reason why I would never plan to go or EVER set an appointment there. All she told me was “well I referenced you a number and you didn’t want it” The misrepresentation of the store she gave was unfair to all who actually work hard and enjoy their service. I’ve never in my life left a disappointed review anywhere. Sad to say today is my first. Hopefully she does better next time she handles a call.< /Review>

My dog has been coming here all of his nine years and they have been good to him. The staff is consistently kind and accommodating. He is always pretty relaxed when I have taken him there. They aren't the least expensive option but they  Certainly are not overpriced and they are more than willing to help you find the most affordable option.  I absolutely love the staff and reccomend them to anyone who asks. Some of my friends have taken their dogs to vets based solely on price and a few of them have been sorry as their dogs either weren't cared for properly or became sick due to unsanitary practices. I have never had a problem here and my mom took her dog here for about 17 years as well. Again, I highly reccomend this place.< /text>

<Review>Extremely DISAPPOINTED with our recent visit!  After years of being loyal customers at San Diego Pet Hospital, it is sad to report that it has become a place where they only want to upsell you and cause you to spend a ridiculous amount of money to treat your dog, trying to get you to return for more appointments before they will give you antibiotics or treatment!  Then AFTER you complain to the office manager regarding the excessive cost to pay for literally nothing, no treatment at all, they lie and say that your dog, who has never threatened anyone, was the problem!  Either they cannot handle big dogs or, more likely, are only interested in making an exorbitant amount of money off of you during these trying times! We're OUT and will not allow our amazing dog to be victimized with lies to cover their pathetic practices!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. E and the staff went above and beyond providing compassionate care for my rescue pup, who is very shy and fearful of strangers. While we were only there for routine vaccinations and prescriptions, she took her time to gain my pup’s confidence before examining and treating him. The end result is a healthy dog with no traumatic experience that is only helping him on his journey to growing into a confident adult dog.
Their compassion and kind approach to the entire well being of my dog was quite impressive. By the end of the visit, my dog was wagging his tail and happily taking treats from Dr and staff, which is a huge new accomplishment for him.  Well done!!! Thank you so much!< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80d9512cb18cbcb7:0x17af3b075e953de2<//Gmap_id></record>

< review>
If I could give them a -0 I would. I came here to get the puppy package for my 2 month puppy at the time. When I first brought her in they did a poop sample and some test and they said she was  in great health . After 2 weeks of having her she kept biting I took her back and they said she was in good health. My puppy finish the “puppy package” with them at 5 months. A week after her shots were completed I took her to the groomers and they said my puppy had worms!!!!!! I took her back to the vet and they told me they were adult worms and that her mom gave them to her! Then they charged me for her medication, which i should’ve have due to them doing the poop sample when I first brought her they should’ve caught it. Ounce they get your money they are rude! If you love your dog don’t come here.</review>

<Review>Walked in today with my cousins dog who was dying. And they told me to come back tomorrow. The staff said the doctor was busy for hours doing a procedure, but what vet was going to see the gentlemen and his two dogs in the lobby. Meanwhile the staff laughed and my mother and I as we walked out. Also the staff in the back was laughing during this so called procedure. We needed help to end our dogs suffering and they told us to make her suffer more. Do not bring your animal there. Oh and last year when I was there they left a door open and lost a cat that was there for treatment. Will be filing complaints to get this location shut down for negligence and for inhumane treatment of animals, which is a felony now I believe. Lawsuits to follow.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Worst experience at a pet clinic I've ever had. They made me wait for one hour and a half even though I was there on time for my appointment. They are extremely expensive. They made me pay 150 bucks just for eye drops and made me come back for another appointment check up for my cat again a week later. Which cost me another 75 bucks and they did not even tell me how my cats corneal ulcer was doing (they claimed they needed to sedate him in order to tell us how his eye was, which costs an absurdly 300$). They even made my cat bleed from the mouth by putting a pen in his mouth, and were not even apologetic about it. They were worried about their pen instead. They are very money hungry, and their service is the absolute worst. They tried to make me pay 600 dollars for a few tests which i can not afford to do. Do yourselves a favor and go to another pet clinic in San Diego. This establishment is a joke and they will try their best to rip you off bad.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

First off this place is NOT CHEAPER! They say that to get you in for as much money on every other test they can do. And they will try to make you feel horrible if you don’t get them.
I brought my pup in and they kept telling me all these meds I needed to give which I already had at home but they didn’t think I should use those only to buy theirs and said they would Report me to spca. What kind of people do this when you already spent 1200$ with them in 3 months!!
They practically hounded me at the desk with a gang of their assistants bcuz I was crying and mad they said they would report me when I didn’t have more money at the time. Horrible.
My pup was brought to VCA and they were so much more affordable and cared for the well being of my dog not just a pay check!! If I had to do over again I wouldn’t ever have stepped into this place. It speaks for itself hidden piece of gum under a desk.
If there is anyway to drive your dog 10 minutes the other way I would definitely do that!
It makes me sick just driving by that place still months later.</Text>

My pup even got a certificate of bravery for doing so well in surgery!  I love this place and will be switching over to them for all of my pets needs!  They're also VERY reasonably priced.<//Review>< username>

They were able to get me in for a visit very quickly. The staff was amazing and called when I was there to get my dogs old vet records. My fur baby loved everyone there. The pricing was standard for vets, but they were able to give a military discount which they just recently started to do. I had a great experience!<//text>

I came into the this facility this morning for my 2 month old kitten, he had a problem with his right hind leg. The vet (short haired woman with glasses) examined my baby and told me he had a possible dislocated hip. This requires surgery and medications. I don’t know if it was because I was young Latina (minority) but she straight out a few sentences into the conversation told if I could not afford my pets needs (I am a low income student) that she would call the ASPCA to take my pet from me. Then she said I was being hostile but how could I not when a few sentences into the conversation about my pets needs you threaten to take him by force. Long story short she was very insensitive showed no remorse for it and I ended up having to relinquish my kitten who I LOVED VERY VERY VERY MUCH. Though she acted as if I did not care for him at all. On top of that afterwards I was informed the vet would pay for all my kittens expenses. Yet you could have done a good deed & helped someone keep their beloved companion & given him his treatment without taking him from me. This clinic had the most insensitive person I have ever met. She has no respect for me or my situation. I love bean very much and am devastated left in tears that my beloved baby was basically forced to be given up by me because if I didn’t she would have called law enforcement. I was going to get him his treatment as soon as I could. I applied for credit care and got declined. They also had an organization to help me but I had to only pay for an X-Ray to get it but could not afford it. I came looking for help maybe if they just would’ve let him have an X-Ray from the kindness of their hearts I would still have bean. I am never going to forget this or my baby bean. I came looking for help not someone to reprimand me for my financial status that I cannot control. All he needed was an X-ray for the organization to help me and they could not even give me that. I try to do one good thing every day from the kindness of my heart and expect nothing in return. I lost my baby today, I loved him so much and I wish he came home with me. I am not someone with many friends not even one and bean was my companion & dearest thing to my heart.</text>

Dr. Romero is wonderful as is his amazing staff! They took such great care of my Fawkes Dog during an emergency. They were thoughtful and kind. Dr. Romero even called at 7:00 pm to make sure our dog was doing ok. They truly care and I could tell from our initial exam where he sat on the floor with our dog to examine him. I will always be a customer here!<//Review>

It’s overpriced and expensive. I took my dog here because I wanted the best care for him but I felt like they hustled me down for money at times saying he needed this and that. I recently took my dog to Tijuana where they cured my dog for $30 instead of paying $800 here. The doctors and staff are nice but the pice was unaffordable for me. So I will only be taking him here it’s it’s ABSOLUTELY  necessary.< /Text>

<review>I'll start off with my first two visits. The first two times having to wait over an hour past my scheduled appointment time to have my pets seen. For my most recent visit, I have never had as horrible service by any staff for any establishment , than of which I have received here. Start off again by having to wait to be seen past my scheduled appointment time, though not as bad as the first two times. Had one staff member slam the door on me as I'm waiting patiently in the room for my pet. Followed by another having an attitude and rudely telling me I need to go wait in the lobby, as if I wasn't supposed to be there and someone had to told me to (which no one did). Didnt use the bathroom because it seemed like a huge ordeal and event to find out if there was one even available, leaving me waiting to find out for about 15 minutes. Doctors themselves are not bad, and there are a few good staff members and techs here, but overall the staff was not good during my visits. I will not be going back there and will be searching for a new vet ASAP. Find yourself a vet clinic that offers service both your pet and you deserve.<//review>< pictures>

Their attentive, tender, and well read staff convinced me and my boyfriend to continue going to this vet. The details of the surgery and costs were spelled out very clearly. They were extremely friendly and gentle with our dog. Unfortunately, even as young as he is he has some tendency towards aggression. The staff knew exactly how to deal with it on their end and even recommended a few options for home solutions. Very pleased.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My cat was hit by a car last year and needed treatment to grow back a large patch of skin. Dr. Clore and the team were so helpful and supportive in the process, I have yet to find a vet hospital that is as compassionate and understanding at this one. They worked with me on prices and gave me all the options. I can't count the times that I felt they went the extra mile. My cat healed successfully from the treatment and I'm so thankful they were there for us.< /Review>

<Review>These folks are always good to our pets (2 dogs) and are very easy to work with.  They are very professional, offering all the very best in care, but when you can't afford to do all the tests, etc. to check everything they understand and give you good advice for lower priced options, weighing all the probabilities and risks against the costs so you can find a good common-sense solution that you can afford.< /Review><Time>1390273188449<//Time><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>5<//rating><username>Sam Gray< /username><UserId.>112323740349333710299</UserId.><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80d9512cb18cbcb7:0x17af3b075e953de2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The place is awesome. They have anything and everything you will ever need regarding fishing equipment. I should have looked them up long time ago. Good place to go if you need some gears and bait. The People that works there are awesome. 👍👍👍<//Review>

<review>I've been shopping here since I was a child. It used to be a great one stop shop where they called their customers by name.

Today I stopped in to buy worms to take my grandson fishing.

Lights were on but the door was locked.  I tapped on the door & someone answered saying they were closed because the cash register was not working.

I said I only need worms , would pay cash & round up the difference  (no change needed). They said NO! go to Berkeley (15 minutes in the opposite direction of our travels).

Lame customer service!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Been going BT for 10 years.  Have all kinds of tackle & bait you’d ever need at good prices.  George will take the time to show you how to put a rig together and how to fish w it.  Good people.  This is a local business we should support so I buy most of my gear from them.</review>

We are brand new to fishing and came to this shop Saturday (2/13/2021) for some hooks and bait.
We thought we knew what we needed from talking to other people, but where obviously a little daunted by entering a shop with so many different options.
After bopping around the store for a little while, we were approached by a man named Ed. I am fairly sure that was his name, sorry if it's not!
Ed came out of nowhere like a shining beacon of light. Surely our requests where simple to people with such vast knowledge, but Ed showed extreme interest in helping us with our amateur fishing adventures.
He didn't play the old salesman trick of trying to sell us a bunch of things, he was just excited. Beyond showing us the best hooks/baits/ weights etc. He asked us were we planned to go and when, and offered an incredible amount of insight and help along the way.
Not once did I get the feeling that we were being judged for not knowing anything, nor did I feel intimated by him or anyone else at the shop. Just honest help and real enthusiasm.
So thanks a ton Ed and everyone at Bay Tackle. We will absolutely be back when we need supplies.
We didn't end up catching any fish that day but maybe that just means another excuse to come to this great shop.

* Also as a side note they took COVID very seriously and we felt safe shopping there forsure!<//Review>

This is the best tackle shop I've ever been to. George has been informative and helpful from the first time I walked in. The bay area is very expensive, so paying a tiny bit more than internet prices is well worth it and proves priceless after all the information and advice you get from the experienced staff (not the type of experience I've had with other tackle shops in the bay area). This is a true and personable local business that I will always support.<//Text>

<review>This place is outstanding. The guys there are fishermen. The give good accurate fishing advice. Great selection of fishing supplies and equipement.  Anything you would need to fish in the SF Bay Area. Fresh bait includes ghost shrimp, eel, worms, roe and more... Worth the visit if you want to find out were the fish are biting , how to rig up and what bait , jig or lure to use. 5 stars< /review>< time>

Letter of appeal to store's Corporate Owner was not replied to.    The switch-out lever feature was critical to my use-need.    I donated the new reel to the Oakland Salvation Army Store.    Purchased "functional" reel from the I-Net.  It's OK to buy bait and worms from a bad- faith place....but if there's any kind of "functionality" problem.....Bay Tackle will give you "The Cold Shoulder".<//Text>< Pictures>

I don’t know how you could give these guys here less than 5 stars. Drove from Vallejo because I heard these guys knew their stuff about fishing everything around the area.  Went in the shop yesterday for the 1st time with my kids and guess what, these guys are the best. My kids are new to fishing and Mr. ED answered every question my kids and I had for him. He took his time with them, explained everything on what they wanted to fish for and set them all up with all the tackle they would need.

Moving on to today. We went out to San Pablo Dam to the spot he told us about and for the 1st time in my life, we LIMITED in CATFISH!

Thank you ED and the rest of the guys at the shop. We will be back and recommend you to everyone.

Alittle expensive but it’s worth the extra cash to have great conversation and gain knowledge on how to catch the WHOOPERS with no BS or dealing with some  employee from WALMART or other stores who could careless.< /review>

<Text>These guys have everything a fisherman could dream of and the knowledge of the employees are the owner is exceptional. The only problem I have with Bay Tackle is that it reminds me of Costco you go in looking for 1 thing and come out with 10. So if you want to get hooked-up visit Bay Tackle.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Bait shot has been here 60 years, twice-as-old as myself, but I remember going here with my grandfather as a boy. I still go here to this day. Prices beat Berkeley Marina tackle shop, it's worth the extra 10 min drive for the MASSIVE SELECTION of equipment.< /Text>

Been coming here for years, if you don't know this place and these guys you're not a fisherman from the Bay Area. The people here help you in any way they can and set you up with the same things that they use. They are not stingy and let you know where to go or where they have caught fish. This place has everything, I wish they had more live bait but rods,reelsan tackle wise,
they've got one of the largest assortments in the bay. You can definitely find cheap deals on things and high quality stuff to. I stop by sometimes just to hear the stories and find out where are the fish are.</text>

< Review>
This is a fantastic shop for fishing. My son is 12 and loves fishing. I don't know the first thing about it. Ed and George have taken my son under their wing and given him lots of good advice about gear, fishing spots and techniques. They don't sell us things we don't need. They are well stocked and provide excellent service. The prices are very reasonable and the service unmatched.</Review>

<Review>Knowledgeable staff, a real bait and tackle store. A wide range of quality fishing equipment and tackle representing virtually all major manufacturers. A huge inventory on hand allows one to mix and match setups and feel what they feel like helping in selection. Prices are very competitive. Please support your local bait and tackle stores. Plus up to the minuet unbiased fishing reports are only a phone call away. Maintenance and repairs are performed on site. They carry all you need from taking kids fishing in the local resovoirs to outfitting one for long range trips targeting monster bluefin tuna.< /Review><gmapID>0x8085785030018e31:0xb7635bdaee919cc2<//gmapID>< Name>

<Review>I have had been going to this place for few years and was always happy with theirs suggestions.
In   last couple of months I spend few thousands for rods and clothes, to my surprised, couple things did not have the quality what was expected .
I went to purchase waders and boots, after 5 hours in the water one shoe practically lost its structure and color obviously it is manufacturing problem or the boots were just too long on the shelf.
Right the 2nd day I came to one of the owners (owner)  and showed him and told him about the problem , he says that this is not his problem and I have to send the product to manufacturer, same happens with expensive broken rod.
To my disappointment, some manufacturers require prove of purchase and I was not able to provide one receipt so even the store could not  reprint  copy, (my fault).
Bottom line is , most of the stuff is it more expensive than you can find on the internet and I am OK with it, given that I relay on  costumer service.
In this case, they are great when it get to selling product, on the other hand you can not count on any customer service after its sold!
Very disappointing.
There is big fishing store up north were I went and told the story  one of the employees, to my surprised he says we are dealers of Phenix, we can send the rod to them for you  (even when it was not purchased from us!).
Now, that"s how you loose loyal customer......

This place has a very nice selection of fishing tackle, but you definitely pay a premium for shopping there.  When items are on sale, they may be around the same price you would get at a place like Wal-Mart.

The staff are very knowledgeable and they don't try to sell you the most expensive option.</Review>

<Text>After having spent thousands of dollars at this shop in the past few years I bought a pair of chest waders from George. He recommended them as some that he had and was very satisfied with them.
I used them two times and the second time they began to leak. I have had similar types of waders and they all have lasted several seasons. So I took them back to the store and George starts back peddaling and giving me reasons why he cannot take them back and give me a new pair. He actually suggested that they sell repair kits and that I should buy and use one of those.
I have read of others having the same response when they have purchased merchandise that soon broke and should have been warranteed.
If you want to support someone like that, do so at your own peril. It will take one experience like mine to change your mind.
I won't be back.<//Text>< Pics>

Disappointing. Bought several thousand dollars worth of gear there. The one time I returned something they claim they never got it and now I'm out almost $200 bucks. No amount of "buying local" is worth that. Plus, as has been said, items are usually available for less elsewhere anyway.< /text>

While we loved the company as a whole; a HUGE shout out to Santiago, Alberto, and Bryan who blew us away with how efficient they were with our move. We've moved many times but have never experienced a moving company with this much professionalism. The crew was on time, communicative, and went above and beyond for us. I would 100% recommend this moving company but make sure you request Santiago, Alberto, and Bryan!!<//review><name>Brianna Dell'Aquila<//name>< pics>

<Review>We worked with Vardeep, Alex, and Alberto on a local move. They arrived on time, even calling to give advance notice of their pending arrival. All three were genial, hard working and patient working with seniors during a big move. They provided helpful suggestions and didn’t get frustrated with re arranging furniture. Highly recommend for any moves!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

These guys were awesome! Vardeep, Alex and Alberto showed up on time moved super fast and were pleasant and energetic on our stressful move day. Their rates are reasonable and Mandy also was very professional and helpful scheduling a local move. Will use them again!< /Review>

<text>Vardeep, Alex, and Bryan are great. Showed up on time, very professional and fun to work with. We moved out of a 4 story town house that was packed full from 16 years of living. They muscled through the stairs. I was impressed with how fast they got it emptied out.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating><gmap_id>0x808fcad7764c8563:0xd85a7b516191e3c4< /gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>102978034958399381558</userid>< pictures>

They were extremely communicative, thoughtful (called out special care for items, asked where household goods should be placed and even helped pack last minute items)
Being 9 months pregnant, it was a huge help to have the help and people who knew what they were doing. Highly recommended!!< /Review><userid>109641116257476291754< /userid><date>1611969161440</date></record></dataset><record>

<text>From booking the move with Mandy, to changing the date to a day earlier with a phone call only days before, to Joe and his team on moving day - Southwest Movers has been professional, friendly and delivers their services as promised. Easy, as-planned, and with a smile is just what we were so grateful for in the middle of moving chaos!

Emilio, Jordan, and Junior did an amazing job. We had a LOT of stuff to move and they did it all with a great attitude. There was nothing that was too hard or a problem they couldn't solve. One of the best moving experiences I've had. They came prepared, on time, and with masks. Emilio went over all the charges and walked us through the timeline and process. Overall, a great team and I would highly recommend.</review>

<Text>Emilio and his team were great! He made sure everything was packed properly and handled with care. His crew were respectful young men. They helped me move from my art studio in Sunnyvale to my home studio. It was no easy task with 15 flights of stairs. They helped to rearrange furniture in my home so items could fit nicely in my home studio. I had horror stories with previous movers, but SW Movers restored my faith in humanity.</Text>< pics>

They were extra careful, friendly and fast! They truly saved our move into our 1st home! I hope I don’t need to move again anytime soon but if I do, these guys will be my 1st phone call!<//Text>

Jason, Emilio, Vardeep were extremely professional and got the job done without any issues. All furniture was properly covered, packed, and delivered. I’ve moved every two years for the past 20 years and never had movers like them. First move where there was no damage to my items. 100% recommend this team and company.< /Text>

Joe and his team were very careful with all my belongs, ensured they were packed properly, and delivered in a very reasonable amount of time (a little over a week). Definitely recommend Southwest Movers and will definitely be using them again.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu96R9d0GjenWc-wDIuyneTCTdBS-BkRz3NxpA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

Jason explained the price breakdown beforehand and they finished the job exactly in the time frame he told me they would.
All in all it was a fantastic experience and I definitely recommend their service.<//review>

<Review>This was hands down the best moving experience that we have had. From the very 1st interaction with office administration, to the execution of the move with Jason and Edger, top notch. What i was really keen on was the hourly charge rate. You don't end up with any hidden fees, costs, or expenses with an hourly rate. Jason and Edger busted their butt's to get this done extremely fast, and extremely professional all while being one man short for the day. I would highly recommend Southwest Movers for your next Bay Area move.<//Review><response>None<//response></record>

Joe and the boys helped our family out with a move and split the loads between two locations all in under one day. They were kind, helpful,  fast and worked harder than I could ever imagined.

They did laugh about how much stuff we had and if it was possible to fit in the house...

Great people, great job.<//Review>

Santiago, Vardeep and bryan wdre fantastic. They arrived on time and were friendly and efficent. They packaged up the loose itema and made it very easy. They deserve extra thanks for the hard work they did with the three flights of stairs!

These guys were great - efficient and friendly! Price was very reasonable for the high quality service provided. They brought extra moving blankets, tape, etc. and fixed up some of the packing we did to make sure none of our items or furniture got damaged. Worked quickly and were careful with our belongings. Would definitely use them again!< /Text>

I have never used a moving company before and from beginning to end they were helpful, efficient, and patient. I first called Mandy and she was cheerful and explained the processes. I had called several places and she was the only personable person I talked to. She made sure everything was set and good to go.

The movers came on time and where phenomenal. Jason, Angel, and Emilio moved things quickly and even helped fix my sofa (which has been broken for over a year...) when they put it in my new home. Overall, I am thoroughly impressed and I honestly will never move without a moving company ever again.</Review>

The gents showed up on time were super friendly! The move was a little hectic as it was only some items from a larger home and they paid attention to all the details I shared. The unload was seamless and easy! Great job! Thanks, Joe, Emilio and Jordan!!!</Review>

<Text>Southwest movers are great! They give you a call before they come, they even handled our upstairs apartment, which we know is a lot of work, last time we moved ourselves in. They wrapped up all our furniture, they took apart beds, loaded everything in the truck and moved it all into the new place fast. Would recommend them to others. Thank you Angel and team!< /Text>< user_name>

Jason and his crew were amazing. They showed up on time and were very efficient. Polite and pleasant guys, it was easy to work with them. I moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to a three bedroom. They finished loading in 2 hours. They packed all the furniture and loose items carefully. I would definitely recommend them to my friends.
Mandy was also super easy to work with. She was very responsive and helpful when planning the move.<//Review>

<text>Fabulous experience. We had a complicated move that the guys pulled of off so efficiently and professionally. The move could not have gone better! I highly recommend them. Easy to set up the date, clear and reasonable prices confirmed ahead of time, on-time the day of the move, clear communication during the move. Not only was nothing broken, but I saw one of the guys rearranging the furniture here and there to make it look perfect in its new home!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

If you’re planning a move, call Southwest Movers TODAY - they are awesome!

Jason, Joey and Angel were a super efficient and organized team and made this move a breeze. As a teacher, I would give them A++ across the board!

The company is professional and punctual, with great customer service from the initial call to the end of the move. They were transparent and up front about the costs ahead of time and went over options for extras without trying to up sell or surprise us with any hidden fees. The company also called us two days before to confirm time and location, which relieved quite a bit of stress on my end having been stood up by movers before. We had called a few different moving companies and Southwest Movers was the most prompt, organized and reasonably priced option and it shows on every level how much pride they take in their business.

On the day of the move, Jason called to give ETA (on schedule, of course!) and the guys brought all the equipment needed like dollies, blankets, tape, mattress protectors, wardrobe boxes (!!!), extra picture boxes and muscles. Moving a 2 bedroom apartment from Santa Cruz to San Jose took just about 4 hours including travel time. They were very careful with my belongings and even took apart the bed and put it back together!

I highly recommend this moving company for your next move!</review>

The process was super smooth! Jason, Angel and Emilio were very professional and nice. No wall scratches. A notable upgrade compares to previous experiences with other companies. These guys do what they need to do and don't try to make the invoice bigger with extra stuff. Very thankful!< /review>

SW Movers helped me with a long distance move and were great!  I filled out the form for an online quote and Joe immediately called me to discuss and then sent me the quote.  Joe came with Emilio and Junior all 3 were friendly, helpful and took great care of my belongings.  While they guarantee deliverly within 17 days, Joe really worked hard and came thru with a delivery to my timeline.  He kept me informed every step of the way as he promised.  My furniture and belongings were delivered to me in the same condition as when they left.  They understand your initial inventory list submitted for the quote may differ from the actual inventory and Joe did a great job keeping the quote and actual super close.  Please note, I packed all my own boxes.
Thank you Southwest Movers!!!</Text>

Our savior...  Stuck on the side of the road with temps over 100 degrees, Southwest Movers loaned me some tools and helped me change my tire.

<Review>I had a great experience from the beginning to the end. Joe and his assistant called me days ahead of our moving date to confirm everything and even managed to squeeze us in for an earlier appointment. Jason, Elmer and Angel arrived on time and were super friendly and efficient with packing our things and wrapping up our furniture up in padding. They also helped with disassembling and reassembling our bed and cabinets which was super helpful coz that’s always such a pain to do! The entire moving process was done in 3 hours. Amazing work and I highly recommend their services. Will definitely be calling them again the next time we move.<//Review>< Pictures>

Joe was very rude and damaged my wall with the sofa, plus they charged 120 for material and they never said on the phone call they will charge for material I am very upset with there service they ask you to give them 5 to wave the 50 dollars for material which is not right, plus they also damage my frame too.
Never will go back to them again I bet you ask everyone here why they give 5 star to them to not pay 50$ and this is not right they should to say over the phone<//Review>

<Text>Joe was very rude and damaged my wall with the sofa, plus they charged 120 for material and they never said on the phone call they will charge for material I am very upset with there service they ask you to give them 5 to wave the 50 dollars for material which is not right, plus they also damage my frame too.
Never will go back to them again I bet you ask everyone here why they give 5 star to them to not pay 50$ and this is not right they should to say over the phone< /Text>< user_name>

<text>The team - Angel, Juniorand Salvador- were amazingly friendly and helpful in making our move a stress free one. They moved all furnitures carefully and even helped move furnitures from one room to the other. They didn’t complaint at all about heavy book boxes- and I had many!. I totally recommend Southwest movers to anyone! Thanks Southwest movers for making our move so smooth and stress free!<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>They did a horrible job. They wrecked our new leather furniture and packed things so that boxes would cave in.

Also really needed to be told in advance how much they were charging for materials. They charge literally 10x the price of Home Depot for things like boxes and tape.

This service just leaves you feeling ripped off and you only find the extent of their poor packing once you're gone.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8GJ_0tpLW2cZFhI9CN8bH_byEh-ZNrcJtNLs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjL4Ijf2c7oPQRq-zsETDDBAMlrIAYbF-FWno=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJf0Lqq2RtY3iuSBMrHgTqhU05iurMNIM6asQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHdzQKhC6hKtqnL6MJokvFvUnDkT-_xMdMLKA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCwCKwiJOZg8bFNC8QGfENZp2Q1ZzODgNmx9w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1yLImRM3UJb7oo6baP1bMU1b5e4Zq0ftUI4A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Name>

We do charge for all materials since we are not doing both locations of the loading and unloading. Had you moved with us, we do offer free tape and blanket wraps to protect your items as they’re placed into our trucks. We are entirely responsible for your items during this type of move so we ensure protection of your property. Whereas when items are packed into a pod, lots of things shift and are out of our control as far as how it’s handled after the initial loading.\n\nAlso, we did everything we could to accommodate your move date which Easter Sunday. We even gave you a rate of a 2 man crew for a 3 man labor crew.\n\nThe photo of the chair- had you had us do the entire move, again the item would’ve been wrapped with a moving blanket and tape free of charge. If you refused any additional packing materials, unfortunately these things can happen when using pods and freight companies.\n\nI am sorry you are left with a sour view about our company, but I assure you, we’ve been in this industry for over 20 years and strive to leave each and every customer happy and satisfied.\n\nI would contact the company who moved your pod and ask them how it was handled during its relocation since it caused damages.\n\nIf you have any additional concerns or questions please feel free to contact me.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJoe H.

<review>Angel, Joe, and Jason were very personable and efficient in their packing! They knew exactly what they were doing! To pack my TV they were upfront with the additional cost of packing material and made sure that they packed everything for safe travels! All standard packing materials came with the price and it was nice to know that you can tell they've done this a million times so far!</review>< pics>

Jason and team did a great job helping my girlfriend move in under 1.5 hours! Very good quality and performance for the price and the movers took great care in setting the furniture up in the apartment after moving. I would highly recommend and plan on using Southwest Movers next time I need to move.<//Review>

Jason, Younes and Luis helped me move and did such a great job. They called to give me their eta, they made sure everything was super carefully wrapped up/boxed up. They made sure everything was moved and gave me all the info before they started. They made sure all my stuff was safe and sound at my new place. They were all super nice and friendly. They were even nice to my dogs. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for help with moving. They were all awesome!<//review>

They were extremely thorough and thoughtful throughout the whole process! I moved to the third floor and you can imagine how tedious and difficult that is for any movers to complete and they did it beautifully. I am so thrilled to have come across them when I did, they will certainly be my go to movers from here on end!<//Review><UserId.>112913143519151329154</UserId.>< date>

< Review>
The arrived 1.5 hours late, charged us extra unnecessarily, purposely worked slow to charge more time, forced us to take boxes from them on rent, surprisingly rude, not helpful. Out of the three guys, only one knew how to pack, others were learning on the job. In the end, they took 30 mins to wrap up their blankets and charged us time for that also.

Highly unprofessional. Will never recommend them for any work.</Review>

<text>Update: We used these movers again for our move this year. This time from our apartment to a single family home. Highly Recommend!

Best movers in town! Our movers Jason, Angel and Amelio moved our stuff very efficiently and quickly. They arrrived on time and are very professional and very easy to work with.They packed all our furniture in blankets and even provided wardrobe boxes for clothes. They also helped us set some of our furniture. Overall I think they provided a great service at affordable prices. 100% recommended.</text><GmapID>0x808fcad7764c8563:0xd85a7b516191e3c4< /GmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< Date>

I worked with Joe in moving from the bay area to Texas, and I am very happy that it all worked well. Joe is excellent in the communication and his logistics. He got the moving done in a week whereas others quoted to take about 14 days. Got it delivered without any delays and right on time.</Review>

<Text>Southwest movers were great! They were willing to drive down summit road onto winding, steep, mountain roads. They tirelessly walked all of our items up and down steep hills surrounding our new home. They were very careful and thorough. They made sure the floors were covered and nothing was damaged inside the home during the move.< /Text>< user_id>

Jason and his team did a fantastic job last weekend! They worked very efficiently, friendly, and carefully with our furniture and stuff.

We really appreciated all their hard work and flexibility to make our move smoothly and happy to be home.

We definitely recommend Southwest Movers to anyone.< /review>

Jason, Fabian, and Younes were so amazing! Not only are they just great guys but they made my dreaded move easy and seamless, going above and beyond to take care of the details.

Yesterday we scheduled a move with SouthWest movers. They did an extremely amazing job moving from South Bay to Tri-Valley region in a record 4 and half hours in extremely sunny (Over 105F) conditions. I'm actually really short of words in describing their efficiency, planning and work ethics.  I'm completely satisfied with their awesome first class work. Jason came with three other guys on time, they were like a rock band brimming with energy during the whole move, always having smile on their face, very soft in speaking and energetic with their move,  accommodating any of my last minute changes. I would give all the guys 10 stars and will call them in future. My personal thanks to Jason and Team.</review>

<review>Worked with Joseph. I have moved a lot, through countries and states. I have never met more professional and nicer person. My parents were moving to Florida to retire.
We have spoken and got quote from numerous companies, but Joseph is the only person who explain every item, every charge and he made true on everything.
My parents are moved, all dates are met and everything is safe in the new house.
Thank you Joseph for being a true Professional!!!< /review><user_name>Ilona Klimenkova<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I recently moved from San Jose to San Diego and chose Southwest Movers, because of the great reviews I read on them. I was not disappointed. Joe and his staff were the utmost in professional. They were on time, quiet and respectful to my neighbors and handled my items with great care. Everything arrived just as it was when they packed it and they assembled and set my furniture back up for. Not to mention, the price was very reasonable too. Moving is not fun and can be very stressful. Southwest Movers made it as easy as it can be. Highly recommend!!<//text>

Quick and professional! They were careful with a tough move because we had a large couch and it was difficult to get out of the apartment. We had to use the back door but they happily did so even though it meant carrying the couch around the block.</Text>

I’m very pleased with Southwest Movers. They just moved me from one home to another in San Jose. Joe and his crew were right on time and have been very friendly and accommodating.

They wrapped the furniture carefully and were very helpful setting it up per my instructions at my new home.

About 4 hours after they started, I’m all set up in my new house.<//review>

These guys were fast and friendly. They packed all our stuff including the clothes, furniture and food, transported it all to a new house and places it all inside.

Unfortunately, they broke our furniture worth ~$1000. It’s more than 2 months since we moved and they haven’t done anything about that. Their insurance doesn’t seem to cover anything.</Text>

Joe and the rest of the SW moving team provided fantastic, personable service for our interstate move from California to Washington.  They did an outstanding job with packing all of our items, not a single item was broken.  Everything was highly planned and coordinated and the price we were quoted was the price we received.<//text>

<review>I have used southwest movers in my recent move in Cupertino.
I am extremely happy with Joe and team (Izeek, Younes).
They are very punctual and job very well done.
They have used all the necessary precautions so that all the items and the walls are protected.
Moving the appliances, especially fridge, need to be disassembled ( and reassemble)so that they fit through the narrow doors.
They have done tremendous job.

I already know who my movers are for my next move.
I will highly recommend sanjose southwest movers.

< Review>
I recently had South West Movers help my boyfriend and I move into our new place. Super hardworking and sweet guys. Very professional and timely from the first call I placed all the way until the job was done. Everything they quoted was upfront, no hidden costs. They took extra care of our valuables and they protected furniture. They even helped us pack up the larger items. They were really efficient and helpful during a very stressful time for us. Everything went really swiftly and smoothly. Hopefully we won't be moving again anytime soon but when we do, we will definitely be using South West again! Wonderful company!</Review>

These guys were fast and friendly. They packed all our stuff including the clothes, furniture and food, transported it all to a new house and places it all inside.

Unfortunately, they broke our furniture worth ~$1000. It’s more than 2 months since we moved and they haven’t done anything about that. Their insurance doesn’t seem to cover anything.< /Text>

Excellent service by Joe and his team. Price was reasonable and they moved things very quickly. All the furnitures were well protected and no damages were found. Also they helped in un assembling all the furnitures and assembling them back at the new place. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for movers.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I chose Southwest Movers because of the reviews they have received and they quoted me the least amount compared to 2 of their competitors and I am very happy with my decision. This is your first time hiring professional movers and I now wish I have done so before. The stresses in moving are the little details you miss, but with Professional such as Joe and his two guys, they took the stress factor away out of moving. They are very good at what they do and is very friendly. I would definitely use them again for a move and recommend others as well. Thanks Joe and Southwest Movers!</review>< pics>

The San Jose movers are professional and nice (thus 2 stars) but the delivery truck (destination another state) is super large. Unless you live by a highway expect to be charged onsite, in cash.< /text>

These guys are hard workers, reliable, and show up a few minutes early. What more can you ask for? They kept the communication open the entire time, a call when they were on there way, stopped for lunch, etc. Mandy in the office was extremely quick to respond and take of business! We will use them again when my parents move.< /Review>

I found Southwest Movers on Thumbtack and I'm thrilled with their service. They were in touch with me throughout the process--from booking to moving day, keeping me informed about next steps. They showed up on time (early even!) and were very professional. It's clear the staff has a ton of experience. They knew all the right questions to ask and anticipated everything we wound need.
Everyone on the moving team was professional and friendly. Great experience all around!< /review>

<review>This move was very rough for me and my kids to have the time to prepared for this move. I also had to change my move in date, due to issues at the new place, so by the time I knew when I could move in, I could not find movers for the new move in date. I went onto thumbtack and found South West Movers and they were quick to reply, gave me all the info and quotes I needed, and Mandy was extremely helpful in coordinating the move and helping me make decisions. The movers called to let me know when they were coming 30 minutes before and arrived promptly at 9. Joe, Walter, and Armando were great to work with and very accommodating. I've used moving companies more than a dozen times, and while we had a nightmare preparing for this move, South West Movers ended up making this move so much better than with the movers I had used a year earlier. I would highly recommend them, they worked with me trying to reduce costs when the move took longer than I thought it would. I will definitely use them fort next move.</review>< pictures>

< review>
I wish I could give 100 stars to Southwest Movers. We have been shopping around for movers from a while and everybody took so long to come or end up giving us ridiculous quotes and ETAs. It hardly took me 30 mins to talk and sort out everything with southwest. I called them at 11 AM and Joe came around 1PM. Thats it all set! It was a very smooth move. Very Responsive, Very accommodating and Super Fast service.  I really know how stressful the move can be but these people made it sooooo much easy for us. I called them so many times as I don't have a destination address. Every time, Joe was very responsive and handled all my questions so well.. pick up and delivery are seamless. Southwest is Awesome! and Joe is the best! Now I know move can be easy peasy lemon squeezy when it is done by Southwest.< /review>

My husband received a pair of shorts for Christmas which he was so excited about. On the 27th he decided to wear the shorts for the first time. He placed his wallet in the back pocket and zippered it up. While we were in a public place we couldn’t get the zipper to open so we were forced to open the pocket by ripping it open. Talk about embarrassing! Will not purchase again!!< /review>

Very helpful staff! Beautiful and modern designs. I didn't end up buying simply because I'm just not sure if they'll be around to stand behind their clothes, particularly the thin liner in men's running shorts. But I'm certain you'd find something you like there. Clothes very comparable to Lulu in quality, though also in price.<//text>

These are by far the most comfortable shorts and pants that I own.  They're comfortable enough to be worn at home when you're just lounging but stylish enough where you don't feel embarrassed wearing them out in public.  They're also fantastic as running wear.

I'm not sure what their in store customer service is like but their online service was phenomenal.  I had a pair of pants that had a defect (seam was not sewn properly) and emailed them to point it out.  They asked for pictures for verification and sent me a brand new pair of pants!  The representatives were incredibly responsive and courteous.   I submitted the claim on a Monday and my replacement pair arrived later that week!

Do you pay a premium for vuori?  Absolutely.  But the quality of materials, design, and service more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I would love to take care of the local company but unfortunately they decided to have everything for men clothing to be from China.
I understand it’s all about money and obviously they decided to out source to China and not USA. Hopefully, they’ll eventually switch back and I can go back to buying local America products.</Text>< Pics>

I bought leggings for one of my adult daughters for Christmas.  She says the leggings "feel like she is wearing a cloud."  Apparently, they are incredibly soft and fit her perfectly.
Unfortunately, word has spread now, so I'll be buying for my other two daughters as well, but glad to buy from a local business!</Text>

Buyer beware,  shops closed but they have no qualms about charging you fees if you wnat to shop or return items.  God forbid it doenst fit and you need to return it.  I also dont believe what I tried on are made for anyone shorter then 5'5".  Poor prduct line for everyone and bad public policyt.  Had I read teh customer sevrice complaints I would have waited until our shut down ended and went and tried on everything before I decided to buy.</text>

I ended up getting the ponto shorts and the transit joggers thanks again gerrit for all of your help I can’t wait to come back and get more!<//Text>

<Review>Vuori has terrible customer service and does not stand behind their product. I bought a pair of ripstop climbers that were defective, unwearable. I didn't notice until months later when I put them on for the first time for the purpose I bought them for. A backpacking trip. Vouri says sorry but "outside of the 60-day window in which we have access to the payment information necessary to process an exchange" Even though I have never actually worn them. They did offer me a 40% discount on another pair...  :(</Review>< pics>

<review>If you like working out and high quality clothing and you aren't buying from these dudes.... man what are you doing with your life?

Seriously though, some prices may be high but they're worth it. I use the shorts for anything and they look good as hell and are just as comfortable . I've been complimented multiple times while wearing them and I've never felt better in any other clothes.

I work out in them, go to the beach with them, wear them casually while doing work, and I even go out partying with them

Buy from them dude ... just buy< /review>< time>

I absolutely love this clothing brand. They offer styles for both me and my wife. There is so much variety! I have been shopping here well over a year! We come in from out of town to shop here ! The friendliest staff! Keep up the great work Vuori! The bank shorts and the equator boardshorts are my favorite !!!!!<//text>

<text>Awesome shorts, good length- cool fabrics. I love these shorts. Also, I had one small issue with one of the pairs of shorts I bought, and Vuori sent me a replacement pair in a heartbeat- way to stand by your product! I'm definitely gonna keep shopping at Vuori.</text><name>Markos Guiberson</name>< gmap_id>

Bought a single pair of Kore shorts at REI and decided we had to go to the local shop near by. This company, brand, whatever has a very bright future ! This place was awesome! Several things to pick from, material is very well made, and the one person working there was very helpful and down to earth and beyond! Will definitely go back to continue buying. Highly recommend with enthusiasm to anyone wanting a brand that will change their life! See you soon Vuori !</text><time>1501461909731</time>< Resp>

Purchased two pairs of kore shorts. Wore the first pair for one afternoon and the inner stitching came undone. Have tried customer service but having little luck. For $60 a pair I would expect better quality and some kind of responsive customer service :(</Text>

Discovered vuori after seeing some of their shorts at REI - was pleasantly surprised to find out they are an Encinitas company.

Appreciated the store's wide selection of men's gear - its usually only a small section at other yoga / boutique fitness places.

Did a great job with the space - this used to be a dingy liquor store (from back in my North County days) that now has a cool modern feel.

Cool staff too.<//Text>

Reasonable oil change price. Brought my own filter and oil and they changed it for $20. Also inspected my car and found a coolant leak that I've been trying to look for.

Edit: upon further review, it seems that they OVERFILLED my oil level far above the "max" dipstick line...< /Text>

Excellent service! My tire was not repairable, but they at least plugged it so I could get back on the road for now. They also noticed two broken studs from the brake job I had done recently, and offered to get the parts and fix it on the spot for what I consider a good price. Highly recommended shop.</Text>

I was looking for a mechanic that will let me bring my own parts since I had already bought my sensor. And Carlos was really helpful and give me an affordable labor price. He installed it right away I was out in about 1 hr. He also give me the oil change special and since I call and make an appointment I got an extra discount. Make sure you call him when you are going because there is another shop beside him and they will try to get you. Car-los auto repair it's the one near the get wall.</Review>

Great Place - I was there this morning to get a simple oil change. The guys went above and beyond. Made additional recommendations. I was in and out in approximately 20 min. Will be returning again for great prices and service.<//text>

I've had my mechanic for years but couldn't get to him because my brakes were on strike so I googled something local.
The price was right, very informative with my options, service was great and fast.
I am seriously considering replacing my old mechanic with Carlos.<//Text>

I have been here twice now for an oil change. Not only are they professional and nice but they are fast and provide excellent service!  It is a breath of fresh air going to a auto repair shop and not feeling like they overcharge and always find something else wrong with your car! I would recommend them to anyone.< /Text>

I found them online they have a timing belt and water pump special  $200 labor when you get the parts yourself, but I found that it was cheaper for me to buy the parts trough them. Honest mechanic is rare I'll be coming back for sure.<//Text>

New spot with an unusual concept. It's fun and interactive. You get to see your ice cream being made, and that is a treat. This place seems like a family run franchise, and they aren't without a few issues. But the focus is on the ice cream rolls. And while it's exciting and fun, the end product leaves you wanting. The texture is not all that it's made up to be. I would still stick to conventional ice cream.

Not a bad place, and one should experience this ice cream roll. At least once.< /review>

What an inventive spot! This was my first time here and I can say that I was really impressed. I thought it may just be a novelty (and it is novel!) But after trying three different creations, I can say definitively that it is great ice cream! I tried the strawberry, the strawberry banana and the Oreo. I was amazed that each combo was largely carried by the main ingredients and didn't seem to heavily rely on super sugary cream bases. In fact, we weren't sure if there was much processed sugar added at all to the fruit flavors. True or not, it was a clean tasting treat that I'd return for again and again.< /review>

This place stands out from other ice cream joints. If you are looking for something new to try, look no further! This can be a little pricey, but take the plunge, place your order, and enjoy the show! They will make your ice cream before your eyes -- these cups are truly works of art! My personal favorite is the purple yam, but I have tried most flavors on the menu, and everything is well-crafted. They have some unique toppings that would be tough to find elsewhere. This is a good one to bring visitors to, as well, if you are looking to impress your family and friends with all the delights the Bay Area has to offer.<//review>

<Text>Delicious home made ice cream. Servers pour a cup of house-fresh ice cream batter on cooled metal plates. Using spatulas to incorporate forming crystals and fruit, they form and roll ice cream in front of you. The results are fresh and delicious. Thai iced tea is our favorite.<//Text>< userid>

The ice cream rolls are so yummy! We had the mango, the banana, and the strawberry mango.  All three flavors had a fresh sweetness and the fresh fruit was amazing! While we were there we saw almost every variety of menu items being ordered. All looked delightful and delicious. They make the ice cream rolls right in front so you get to see the process, which is really interesting and fun to watch. The customer service is really polite and friendly. We definitely recommend and will become regulars.  Thank you so very much!<//Text>

Soooo I have to visit this place again. Visited today with a group of work friends for a birthday lunch. Ordered a variety of sandwiches, salads, soups, and man even one thing was not bad! One would think its just an ice cream place, but one of the best american diners in Oakland.

<Review>The ice cream is cool. More presentation than taste. So it's a bit overpriced. At least a dollar less would be better. Who controls the price range sign though? $7.80 a pop is not a one dollar sign thing.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><user_id>112096707488870093042</user_id><user_name>Eddie Tobias</user_name><Gmap_id>0x808f80c9fd749d1f:0x4a8db8aa295eae38< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They were really quick when making the delicious, frozen treats! There is a wide variety of ice creams to choose from and the rolled ice cream is made in front of you! The ingredients are especially fresh, and there are interesting test-flavored ice cream such as wasabi, durian, and chrysanthemum!! I got the blueberry-strawberry rolled ice cream and sampled the flavors mentioned above. I thought wasabi would be strange, but I enjoyed it the most! Stop buy and give this place a try!</review>

Are you kidding me?!? I'm reading so many reviews about price and portion sizes, lol. The small cup of ice cream was so worth the $7 bucks! The place gives a good-sized portion amount. And to be honest, you really shouldn't be eating anymore, lol.

Just because an ice cream place is in Oakland Chinatown doesn't mean it has to be cheap. For the effort and craftsman of the Instagram-able ice cream rolls, I'd definitely say it's worth the price tag.

My party and I went around 6 pm on a weeknight and got our orders within 15-20 minutes. I was just in "awe" with the artistry of making the delicious rolls.

I ordered the Purple Yam and my brother got the Matcha Green. I'd recommend both as they're both to die for. Super thick. Super creamy. Mhm. They were both just explosions of flavors.

Overall, I'd totally come here as this place was super delicious.

A few negatives to note:
- Cash only
- No line/name system</text>

Great rolled ice cream flavors! I had the Thai tea and it was spot on! The service was not great though... the woman at the cash register/taking our order was curt and not helpful at all. Would have been 5 stars with better service.<//Text>

Personable service at this new corner nook serving yummy Thai-style ice cream roll sundaes in Oakland Chinatown. Don't be scared off by the smell of gas when you walk in -- it's not dangerous, it's just durian. You might have to wait a few minutes for your order since they make the ice cream rolls to order, but it's worth it.</text>

Good icecream. Thai tea is bomb and pretty cheap for a huge scoop. 2 icecream cups for 5 dollars. Never tried the actual rolled icecream too pricey for me.</Text>

I actually tried durian ice cream! I was a very mellow taste albeit one I will never eat again. They had lots of other interesting ice cream flavors too. For the  main event I got the mango roll. It was fun to watch them chop up the mango, pour on the ice cream, and watch them work it on the ice table into the ice cream rolls. Looked like the used fresh fruit too. Not cheap at $7ish per dessert, but the show and size is worth it. They are shareable if you desire. I ate 80% of mine though.< /text>

Generous portions and fresh fruits for the rolls. The milk tea is also a must have. The wasabi ice cream is pretty good as well, it's made with real wasabi instead of the horseradish stuff</Text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) If you want to eat ice cream in Oakland, you're in good hands here. The ice cream is handmade. The ice cream parlor looks clean. The decor is neat and clean. The staff (on this day there were two young ice cream men) is friendly and endeavors to implement the customer request. Hope to see you soon.

Wer in Oakland ein Eis essen möchte, ist hier sehr gut aufgehoben. Das Eis ist Handmade. Die Eisdiele sieht sauber aus. Die Einrichtung ist ordentlich und sauber. Das Personal (an diesem Tag waren es Zwei junge Eismänner) ist freundlich und bemüht den Kundenwunsch umzusetzen. Hoffentlich bis Bald.< /Review><user_name>Daniel Dahmen<//user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>117039453643266155468<//userid><Response>None< /Response>< pics>

Came here to check this place out after hearing raving reviews from TikTok. The food was OK, one of the ladies that took care of me was in an awful mood, but another one (an older lady) was super sweet and nice and so was the cashier, so maybe the middle-aged one was just having a bad day in general? Portions are big, and you'll end up satisfied and full.< /Text>

<Text>5/5 stars this place is an amazing place to stop by in Westminster! The proportions are HUGE I ordered 3 2 item combos for my 5 person family thinking we were gonna finish it but no you can feed up to 10 people if then! I did not feel any type of discomfort in my stomach after eating what's so ever. Also their customer service was A+ the lady saw that the bag that had the plates of food and the sauces was sweating so she went the extra mile to give me a separate bag just for the sauce and they really don't skimp on the sauces too. You will be amazed when you enter this establishment!</Text>< name>

I just can’t believe all of those reviews below are legit and real, I walked in the other day to get some food, I ordered to go, the lady in the cashier was rude and has a lot to learn about customer service. Food wasn’t fresh and looks so bad, I couldn’t even finish half of my plate, I trashed it right away and I’ll never come in back to this place, watch out.

Staff has never really been friendly but they have also never been rude. Food isn't mind-blowingly amazing but it doesn't taste bad. All in all if you wanted "average" you'll have it here. They do however give you a lot of food for the price, so there's that.< /text>

The portions are immense. Two people could eat a single 2 item combo. That works out to $5.00 per serving. Very generous.</Text>

I was fairly disappointed. With the high rating, I was expecting great tasting food. Yes, the portions were very large which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the food tasted terrible. To me, this restaurant is the epitome of quality over quantity. I’d rather have less great tasting food than a lot of mediocre food. Besides, their prices reflect the food portions. Yes they give you more food than other places, but they also charge you more. I paid $11 for a 2 entree combo. I sadly can not recommend this place.< /Review>

<text>What did I get myself into?! My fiance has been coming to Hong Kong Express since his job relocated nearby. He would always send me photos and today, I realized why he loves this place. I had a 2 item combo. Half rice/chow mein, orange chicken and egg rolls. I assumed it was 1 egg roll. Nope it was 2. And they were HUGE THE! The amount of food on my plate. OMG! My plate ALONE could feed my fiance and I. The orange chicken was GOOOOOOOOOD. Best egg rolls I've had. He had chow mein, orange chicken and green bean chicken. NETHER of us were able to finish our food. It would have been impossible.

Thank you!! See you soon!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The food is actually really good,prices fair and portion size huge. The problem is that I get sick every time I eat there. At first I thought it was just me. After going back and getting the same result 3 times over the course of 2 months I'm pretty sure it's not me. I will not be going back and it's a shame as I said before that the food is pretty tasty.< /Text>

I go to this marvelous  place many times because I like the good mood that is characterizes this restaurant. The crew is highly welcoming and professional. The service is extremely efficient. Not to mention, the food they prepare is magnificent. I ate there many times and I was always joyful. The cost is modest. I suggest this restaurant to all my friends.</text>

Most amazing food I've had in a long time. Feels like home cooked food. Ate here once and came back every other day for 2 weeks and counting. You should definitely give this place a try or your missing something in life amazing portions, food, prices, not much more else to want.<//text>

I give the MEGA SERVING Hong Kong Express located at 15452 Beach Blvd, Westminster, CA 92683 FIVE EGGROLL STARS. A friendly and generous staff is what this Hong Kong Express has. One plate is enough for 3 people. 😱 5️⃣ ⭐'S</text>

<review>It was OK. VERY generous portions. We each got a two item meal with half rice and half noodles. I chose the orange chicken and BBQ pork. The orange chicken was alright. The BBQ was tough and too hard to chew. Overall it was kind of what I expected for a fast food Chinese food place. You will definitely get filled up!<//review><gmap_id>0x80dd2646d35e527d:0x37f3173fe42f2e1<//gmap_id>< Time>

Stay away from the rice though it's horrible and it seems like the lady at the register can't do simple math because every-time I go it's a different price for the same stuff. The food is great when it's great and not so great when it's not cooked well; lack of consistency but still my favorite Chinese food place even though it seems they go up on the price every 6 months now.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Usually, I buy here a side of chow mein. The place is not really friendly. The prices are different all the time. One day my chow mein costs $3, another day $5 for the same portion. That's so weird to me.<//Text>

The food comes out fresh and warm every day! Broccoli beef, friend rice, and the chow neon are absolutely delicious! It’s nothing like Panda Express; though it comes out very fast, it tastes delicious! I 100% recommend going here if you’re in the mood for Chinese food!<//text>

<Time>1544054571586<//Time><review>If you're REALLY hungry, this is the place you've GOT to go. Portions are HUGE. You can barely close the box. The only thing I don't like about this place is the temperature of the food. I ordered the BBQ pork which they had sitting on TOP of the steam table and it was basically cold  which is a big no-no, especially as far as pork goes. The other items I had were warm at best. I've been in here quite a few times and it seems like kind of the standard. Other than that not a bad place to eat, but I think I'm better off at Panda<//review>< UserId.>

They fill the heck out of your plates. The tray will be overflowing and they'll still continue to place someone more, which is awesome for the affordable price. 9/10 food is always fresh.

<text>This is my favorite place to get Chinese food. There spicy wings are the best. The beef and broccoli is crunchy and tender. The fried rice is so savory and different from other fried rices that I've had. The chow mein is delicious.

The restaurant has the most amazing savory food. The ladies that work here make it exciting to stay and eat. They talk and talk and everyone loves it. They have some conversations in Spanish, their language and English. Overall this restaurant is the best and their Chinese food is the best I've ever tasted<//Review>

Although it's not the most trendy place, I have to admit the food is so much better than most places out there. The price is reasonable and the portions are huge. I love the ladies that work there; very welcoming and social. It impressed me that the third time I visited, one of the ladies remembered my usual order!<//text>

The food was just okay.pretty typical. I had mushroom chicken, which tasted questionable, meaning not quite like chicken so I threw it away the texture was a little off to me, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli The noodles where thick and the food was kinda greasy. Not eating there again.</text>

This is the best Chinese Take Out in the County. The food is fresh, hot, and in VERY generous portions. You can try to find a better Orange Chicken but I can guarantee that no one can neat the ladies of Westminster Hong Kong Express< /text>

I choose the two item combo with half rice and half chow mein. This definitely filled me up and took about a third of it home for lunch the next day. Great price for 1-1/2 meals. Will be back!< /review>

I've been coming here since I was 13, now I'm 23. Friendly customer service everytime I go. Food here is always fresh. One combo plate can literally feed a whole family of four. Egg rolls are always cooked crispy. The sauce here is always wonderful (perfect spiciness). Their party plates are decent prices. I live in LA but it's always worth coming over here. 5/5 stars!!!<//Review>

I really like their service. The ladies there are welcoming and they give great portions!

I was worried that they wouldn't except credit card because of previous reviews, but they do take card now!

I don't come often, but whenever I do, I'm never disappointed. My usual order is chow mein and fried rice with jalapeño chicken.< /Review>

They will give you enough food for 4 people and unlike many such Chinese places thier food is not only plentiful but Delicious. You'll get so much you'll actually ask them to slow down and go easy. Cram jammed packed and piled as if you'd never eat again! Really sweet kind humble attentive staff as well. Easy in and out parking. Cheap. Quick. Tasty. Tons of it. Who could ask for more?< /text>

AMAZING food, WONDERFUL service, the owner is very nice. If you want good, dependable Chinese food, this is the place to be. You got your classic orange chicken, chow mein, and the fried rice is bomb. Also the beef broccoli??? 10/10, would order again.  I love this place, very dear to my heart, and everything is at a reasonable price. Very good<//text>

<Review>The food is great quality, and this place has very reasonable pricing. Employees are very helpful and caring. I don't understand how some people would say that their food is bland because they arrive at 8:56 (closes at 9). So basically they get leftover food, and they can't complain it's cold because that's all that's left. Since it's closing the lights were dim, not fully on but not fully off either. So why would someone claim that it was "dark"? My advice to those people would be, get the food in the afternoon so it's fresh. It's all about timing.</Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dd2646d35e527d:0x37f3173fe42f2e1< /GmapID></record>

Amazing portions will literally blow you away. There has never been a time I've gone here where my to-go box would actually close, the plastic bag that they tie around it is literally what holds it together!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I love it here!! Been coming here since 2004 and I love the ladies; they are so sweet and friendly.
If you're on a Budjet this place will feed you well.. Most Chinese food places like Panda Express give you so little for your money but here they are not greedy they will send you home with leftovers. I now live in Big Bear but I visit here when ever I'm this way.< /Review>

Portions are really generous and for the price of 1 item for 6.69, 2 item for 8.19, and 3 item for 9.39, it's definitely a steal! The food is always made fresh daily and you can taste the quality ingredients that the big chain franchises skimp out on. Would reccomend!< /review>

<username>Shirley Manuel</username><Time>1532996576770</Time><review>I’m a little baffled at all of the super positive reviews of this place. I thought it was absolutely terrible!! And the portions that everyone spoke about are true. It’s ridiculous how much food they give you. To me, it doesn’t even remotely resemble Chinese food. The portion size just tells me that they don’t value the food that they serve. It’s a big fail for me but obviously I’m in the minority. 😳</review></record>

This is my favorite go to Chinese fast food joint. They give so much food. I love it! The ladies are very nice as well.

My favorite combo is the chao mein and orange chicken. You can't go wrong with it. The food is very delicious overall. Just a heads up you will get very very full. I leave super satisfied every single time I go.

Parking is easy and it is cash only so heads up !

10/10 Food, Service and Cleanliness !< /review>

Went to get cheese food after I got off from work decided to try this place. The old lady was rude and the pork was dry and the Orange chicken was gross. The food got me sick, I ended up throwing up about an hour after I ate here. I would not recommend this place to anyone.<//review>

I felt sick to my stomach the minute I walked into this place I still tried to look for maybe something to eat after reading reviews of it being good but now the girl was picking out items out of one tray it appeared that it was watery and unappealing so she was trying to fix it the glass was so steamed you could barely see what was in there the smell of Rockton meat filled the dining area no 1 even greeted us when we got there so we turned around and l Left<//review>

<Text>Very busy. Employees not very friendly. Steam table food. I didn't really care for their selections. I had the BBQ chicken, orange chicken, chow mein & rice. I wanted the BBQ pork but the lady helping me said, "bbq pork no good what else you want instead." She pointed to pork swimming in watered down sauce. I tried the orange chicken instead. The whole experience  was average.</Text>< name>

This place hands down my go-to Chinese food restaurant. The food is amazing, The service is great, and the price you pay for what you get is so much more than what Panda Express or any other Chinese food restaurant would give you . Super cheap and affordable.< /Review>

This place is amazing for the price you pay and the meal lasts for 2-3 at most, really hard to do in 1 go but it's a good thing, been to this place several times and still happy by food and the staff, very nice, I promised them to do a review, I'm not a fan of Orange Chicken but this place does a good job of making me change my mind and the Chow Mein is really great .< /Text>

they have no choice food,the few choice food they have is not taste good, lady was very RUDE, they have no area for family cos they have supply that area ,I am sorry but there's around many homeless,expensive food comparing with an other places.reason I gived a start cos they give  a lot food and I think that's why customers giving no less than four stars , but for me and my Family that is not important.(QUALITY IS IMPORTANT BUT  SERVICE TOO )</Text>

The brocolli beef is good, the kung pao isn't the best I've had but it's still pretty good. We will try the orange chicken next time. The ladies are nice and quick to serve and checkout.

<review>(Translated by Google) It is good and inexpensive and I give it 3 stars because it lacks a fix to its facilities, they just have to do a little more and I give them 5 stars
