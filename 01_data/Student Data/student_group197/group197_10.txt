As of now (Thurs, 13 May 21) they are open to a limited number of bowlers!  Its great tobgo bowling again!  It wasn't needed on a Thursday evening, but its a good idea to call ahead and make reservations.</Review>

Wow I am impressed. Never seen a bowling alley look so nice. Couches are really nice and comfy!</Review>

<Review>The last two times I have gone. The lanes have broke down way too much. I buy an hour of bowling and maybe get to bowl for 15-20 mins. I guess I’ll just buy by the game and take a few hours to bowl them. I went through 4 lanes while I was there each time</Review>< user>

< Review>
This bowling alley is great. In the month that I have been here we have been there 5 times. They have a good Single Marine Program special on Tuesdays at $5 for 2 games and shoes. Their food is pretty good too. They have 40 lanes for your bowling pleasure. They have their balls separated by weight/color so its easier to find what you like. They also have a party room you can reserve for birthdays or whatever you want as well as discounts for those events. They have a decent amount of people for league play, but still have room to fit others who are not on a league. Overall good atmosphere, friendly staff. Keep it up.<//Review>

This bowling alley is pretty nice! The food is pretty good, the staff is nice, prices are good, and I don't think I've ever seen it be crowded with people. They have a bar, food, arcade, clean restrooms, and the set up is nice. I love their couches super comfy! Can't say I've ever had a bad experience! :)</Text>

<text>This is a nice bowling alley as it is a great time. They have a small arcade as well inside. They usually have music playing but sometimes they have movies. There is a good food place inside called the grill. The staff their are pretty nice. The only problem I would say is the lanes do sometimes break a decent amount, but even when they do they get it up and running again decently fast. All in all it is a great place to bowl.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc7baacfab609b:0xab1c90fa3bff7b8b< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<name>Lauren Busby< /name><text>I love leatherneck lanes, it's the only place we go to bowl now. Its so much more affordable than the bowling alleys out in town but just as nice, if not nicer! The music selection is fun, its clean and being on the base i feel safe bc it doesnt draw a bad element/rough crowd and it doesnt get rowdy. It seems super family friendly every time we've been. There's a snavk bar that serves ok food(stuff the kids will like) and they serve beer and mixed drinks, so everyone is happy!!</text><Date>1573709590572</Date>< userid>

<user_name>Antonio Santiago< /user_name><text>Great place to bowl with friends and family. Weekends are CRAZY so I would highly suggest going on a weekday or early on a Saturday. They have great lanes, arcade room, and a grill you can order food at. Which is also really good, but price is iffy. I personally don’t think it’s that bad, but not everyone is on the same budget. This is definitely a place to check out if you want something to do. It’s also right next to restaurants and other services which is great.< /text>< rating>

This bowling ally is one of the best I have been too. They serve very good food. The food is very well priced as well. There is plenty of space for you to bowl, eat, or just hang out. They also have very good internet, so you can get your work done and eat lunch at the same time.</Review>

<review>What a great bowling alley! The decor is very nice and fitting. Most bowling centers on base look run down and out of date but Leatherneck was a pleasant surprise. Love that it wasn't too noisy and the music was at a good level. Gentlemen at the counter were super friendly!<//review>< UserId.>

Most affordable bowling alley in North County. Really slow during the work week and somewhat busy on the weekends and week nights. Usually a toss up. The NEW menu has chili cheese fries and chili nachos for a great price. Unless you're bowling with kids, play by hour and have the other people pay for their shoes. Prices change by day and time.</text>

Clean place. The food is awesome. The crowd is mostly family. You will need base access. I don't remember but one day out of the week they have 50% off shoes or games.</review>

These was a serious problem with the staff and the food tickets. I ate lunch there every day this week and not one day did orders come out in the order they were placed. Lots of Marines were frustrated with this and how long the orders were taking. With only two staff on deck to handle long lines it wasn't working. Orders were seriously taking 30mins to get out. The Marines in our classes only had 1hr for lunch and were having a hard time making it back to class. I hope they can make some changes to improve this.</Text>

This place is by far the best bowling alley I have ever been to! It's comfortable, very family friendly & the staff goes out of their way to make you welcome. We went for my husband's birthday... we had no reservation or anything but they still went above& beyond to help us make it special for him. They welcomed our church group with a banner across the video screens the entire night & they even gave my hubby a bowling pin with happy birthay wishes written out to him which our group signed as well. This place is truly awesome... GO THERE!!!< /text>

The lanes are always breaking which requires us to continually notify the staff. The place looks wonderful and the food is very good. If we could get good working and oiled lanes that'll be a delight.< /Review>

It's okay, cute, family friendly but not too cheesy. There's 6 pounders, I think that's the lightest they have on hand. Food is pretty meh for a bowling alley. Music is usually on and only kids sized shoes have Velcro straps. If you're an adult you'll only get shoe laces. If your kid doesn't know how to play they have these small dinosaur slides that you can roll the balls on. It's really fun for a family/day. If you want to go for a retro day you should go here and follow up with Johnny Rockets for dinner. :)</review>

My only complaint is the price. The food is great and decently priced... But the cost of bowling alone usually turns me away.< /Text>

We were pleasantly surprised to have such a nice bowling alley to hang out at while our son had his paintball birthday party. It's a beautiful facility. We had a good burger and curly fries with a couple IPas. It is on Camp Pendleton. Thank you to all our servicemen and women!</text>

<Review>This place is the best gym on Camp Pendleton. Every 7 foot bar weighs exactly 45 lbs. The 45 lbs plates weigh exactly 45 lbs... you get the point. The antifatigue matting actually strips away your fatigue, allowing you to extend your workout or achieve greater GAINS. Lastly the Marine employees are all volunteers from elite battalions and squadrons, chosen for their dedication to fitness, knowledge of bodybuilding and general helpfulness. One of them spotted me on the bench on a heavy set, and I ended up not needing it, probably because he was there. Parking is rarely a problem unless a unit is training or there are ceremonies on the parade deck, then you might as well go running.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Went with my family great atmosphere awsome time. Bowling is expensive. One game 5 dollars per person per game. So you got 4 people its 20$ a game. For two games with four people with rentals is 47$. Play by the hour is 30 something with four people plus rentals. With one of the players which was 5 years old we only got i game plus one frame for 31$. So i would shop around the area for a cheaper place if you wanna hang out for the night. Food was good beer little pricey. 5 dollars for ipa's ect. 4$ for bud or bud lite pint.</Review>< Pics>

One lane the balls gets stuck constantly, it's the lane just to the left of the front desk when you walk in. Pitchers of beer are pretty cheap though.<//text>

<username>Gigi Barros<//username><Date>1624243511468<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>I got a pedicure and a full acrylic set with gel nail polish and I've been getting lots of compliments on my nail color that I chose from here. My nails haven't broken and I've had them on for 3 weeks now, longest I've ever gone with nails. Everywhere else I've gone they've never lasted as long, so that makes me happy and want to go back. Only thing is when I do go here my nails are just a basic color no jewelry or designs.</Review>< Pictures>

They were super nice. Hannah did my nails.  She paid attention to detail, i didnt have to point out anything.  I mentioned color was a little light, she offered an extra coat. I would highly recommend, specially since im picky.  Cant say the same about the pedis.< /Text>

This was the first time I visited this place of business. The person who did my mani/pedi was very gentle and meticulous making sure everything was just perfect. Thank you</review>

I have no idea as to why their rating is so high . This place is absolutely terrible !!!! The ladies are very rude . I had to wait about 20 min even though I had an appointment. And I when I told her I wanted to get a different shape , she said she was going to charge extra ( which is okay) I told her Yes, and she said it was too expensive for me , and that I couldn’t afford it . When finished I payed and quickly left . I will never return again . Do not come here !</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible experience! I came here with 2 of my cousins & we all had a very bad experience. Right when we walked in, the lady at the register greeted us rude. We asked for pedicures & she rolled her eyes & told us “ok, pick a color.” While we were looking for a polish, she rushes us & tells us to hurry. Mind you, we weren’t even ready with our polish. We practically just grabbed any color. Then, the ladies didn’t even give us any time to soak & relax our feet in the water. Everything was so rushed & careless. One of my cousins didn’t even get polish on because the lady doing her toes didn’t even trim her toe nails correctly. She was literally trimming them in a triangle shape... pointy tip & everything! After several times of my cousin trying to correct the lady & telling her she wanted regular square shape toes, she kept going deeper on the sides & making them like triangles. Finally my cousin was done & told the lady to please stop. But during this process when the lady was using a cuticle trimmer on my cousins toes, she then uses it on HERSELF! She trimmed something off her hands! Without any cleansing, Disinfecting or Sterilizing. & right after she puts it away in her kit! We about just died at this point. & couldn’t believe what horrible experience we had. Out of many salons we been to, this one is Definitely the Worst! & I do not recommend at all!</review>< Pics>

I dont let anyone else do my nails. They do quality nails. They get busy though so there may be a wait but it is worth it. They are friendly. Flower and Vincent always does their best to make sure everyone is taken care of.<//text>

< review>
went to get a waxing service done here and this place is so unprofessional and unsanitary. as I was sitting in the waiting area people kept going in and out of the room and not once did i see the lady go into the restroom and wash her hands (I didn't really make a big deal i thought maybe there was a sink in the room or something). when it was my turn I went in and I also realized there was no sink in there and the lady DID NOT wear gloves while waxing her customers. as I was getting waxed the lady also did not pull on my skin before ripping off the wax causing her to rip off some of my skin. nice looking place but will definitely not be returning to this place again.</review>

<review>So my review is primarily focused on the eyebrow waxing because this was the only reason I came to Venus nails. So I have been getting my eyebrows waxed here for 4 years and never thought about leaving a review until a recent experience I had. So I moved towns recently, therefore,  had to find a new eyebrow lady. I went to European Wax Center which sounded pretty legit. The first wax was free so that was nice.. but the actual waxing was horrible! They normally charge $21 for their eyebrow waxing compared to Venus only charging $8! Although European Wax Center did use hard wax meaning it was less painful, it took sooo much longer! My eyebrows looked nothing compared to the eyebrows I get when Flower does mine at Venus. I was sooo disappointed after my recent wax that I had to go home and fix them up myself. The point of this rant was to not take Venus’ eyebrow waxing for granted; as from now on I will only be waxing my eyebrows when I go back home. 10/10 would recommend Flower because she’s quick and works miracles!< /review>< Pics>

<review>So when I got there the wait was over 30 min which is do able since I was a walk in. Once I sat down with the gentleman to do my nails he treated me as if I don't go get my nails done every 2-3 weeks as needed. I also asked that my nails be thick because I work with heavy steel and don't want them to break, I did not want all the lumps and gaps so when I mentioned something you could tell the attitude he was giving me by the way he started handling my nails. I didn't want to cause a scene so I let him finish the horrible nail job he was doing, paid and left. I will never go back to this salon again. I wish I was able to show you all my nails. I have paint on my fingers and a gap that makes it look like it's been over a week since getting them done and it looks like my nails are doing the wave with how lumpy they are.< /review><UserId.>114739256470625181398< /UserId.><time>1545044878223< /time>< GmapID>

Extremely poor customer service. Front desk person doesn’t even make eye contact not speak well to customers. Had me and two others wait for half an hour for someone that wasn’t even in the building. When asked why we were told to wait for someone that wasn’t working at the time, I was spoken to with a rude tone. Definitely don’t recommend this unprofessional place to anyone.</review>

< Review>
I went in to get a my eyebrows waxed. I was waiting about 8-10 minutes. The whole time there was this girl getting her toes done. As I’m still there waiting the girl gets up and the lady says she needs an eyebrow wax. The lady that does the wax was sitting at the front desk the whole time doing nothing. Takes the girl back and waxes her eyebrows. I was so frustrated knowing that with in that time of the girl getting her toes done I could have gotten my eyebrows done that I just got up and walked out.</Review>

I went here to get my nails done 3 times and ended up with FUNGUS I went to get a new set and 3 weeks later I went for a fill.  Then today I went to the place across the street and the lady told me I made the worst mistake going there cause I ended up with FUNGUS on 4 if my nails and I came home and told my mom cause my grandma took me and the lady said she couldn't do anything expect go back and get my nails fixed but we told her I got them fixed today.  The customer service was HORRIBLE.  I will never go back and I learned my lesson cause my friends have gone and ended up with the same thing.  I went to a different place today cause it was  busy and I feel bad for all of those people getting a fill or new set.  I wrote this review cause I don't want other people to go and end up with the same stuff.  My mom is going to call the health department tomorrow when I am at school</Text>

This place is amazing. Well organized and clean and it looks like they recycle absolutely as much as they can of any product that goes in there.  I would not normally think I could be impressed by a dumping facility, but this place impressed me.</text>

What a great place open Crazy late. The people are always pretty cool. It's all being recycled so you feel good about it. A bit expensive but it's not a dump they still have to pick through it end send it away. I think it's worth it< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service I went for the first time because I looked at positive comments I went to vote for 5 bags and that was pure paper and plastic they asked me for a $ 130 deposit, when I returned they weighed again, the $ 130 they charged me, I don't think if they take something heavier

No reservation needed or possible, it’s a first come first serve. To find a spot you’ll have to drive through the campgrounds. It helps to have one person get out of the car and read the permits, sometimes previous occupants forget to take their permits off the site markers, so it’s easy to think the site is occupied. Once you’ve found your desired site, park(each site has it’s own parking spot). Make sure you take a picture of your license plate and remember your site number. Head back towards the entrance of the camp grounds, in front of the info board you’ll find the permits you’ll need to register for you site, oh yes make sure you have a pen too, and exact change, cause you’ll be depositing payment into a slot. I didn’t have exact change, and wasn’t able to find staff around.

I recommend arriving well before evening, so you’re not setting up tent in the dark and with bugs. Beautiful meadow view. Restroom well stocked with toilet paper, trash was emptied daily, clean except for the bugs, but what do you expect, it’s better than porta-potties, functional soap dispensers and sinks with hot water.

What I loved about this campground was that each site has a parking spot and it’s own fire pit and some even have benches nearby. You’re allowed to burn any downed wood, twigs, pine cones around, NOT TRASH.  There are dumpsters around to dump trash. Tons of cute spots to take pictures.

Also some sites might be hard to accommodate more than one car, there’s a parking lot next to the campgrounds.

One last thing, I have sprint and the reception SUCKED, I was only able to receive and make calls. But luckily we didn’t need phone service, just make sure you check the weather & maybe make a make available offline if you’re maps dependent.< /Text>

Great camp grounds, easy walk to the lake. Would be good if it had shower facilities though.< /Review>

Pretty nice $30 first come first serve no reservation campground about 3/4 mile from Pinecrest Lake.  About 3/4 mile walk to the lake depending on camp site.  Flush toilets with lights, but only a few for the whole campground.  Good fresh water from spigots.  Trees are slowly dying away leaving less and less shade so be nice to the trees when your here.  Most camp sites have several spots for tents, and most have large paved parking pads for at least 2-3 good sized vehicles, several different types of sites from open sunny, to shady, some rocky, some in a meadow and some with tents spots down a hill.  You can hear the highway from the campground louder depending on what size you campng in but its not horrible, but the semis drag brakes can be loud if late at night.  They allow fires in fire pits currently when I visited.  I had to review because there was no good picture of the camp site layout I could find online except their hard to read size number map posted so I had to put a good map I found of the grounds, enjoy, camp, and have fun!! 4 stars cuz its far from lake, lots of sun, limited bathrooms and neighbors houses with lights on all night long.<//Text>

Me and my family come camping up here every July and I love it! We stay for almost a week and we play games, have campfires, etc at the campground and it is very close to Pinecrest where the lake is at for people to spend time at the beach, boating, fishing, and more while at night there is an outside theater there. And yeah, there is a view of a meadow! 😀<//text>

<Text>Facilities need major updating. The views are amazing. The lake is a nice cool down temperature. Lots of cool hiking trails. Boat rentals. They also have an old school shack where you can burgers and ice cream.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Good campground but it was way too loud over night even after midnight. There was no security guard eventhough we called them many times.</review>

This is a non reserve camp site located about a mile away from the lake. The sites range in size but many are awfully close to each other. Another issue is the bathrooms were often extremely messy. Dodge Ridge maintenance staff seem to do their best go keep them clean, but this might be just an issue with all the campers. Also the campsite is located next to the Lair of the Golden Bear campsite. During our stay we we're subjected to loud DJs and buses driving around late at night. Not really the kind of camping experience you would like if you enjoy some peace and quiet< /text>

I love this campground. There is no need for reservations it is first come, first serve. Beautiful view all around, and grest hiking trails. Pinecrest lake, showers and stores are about a mile away.</Text>

I normally have a hard time trusting people to cut my hair but needless to say from multiple barbers they've never let me down. Matt has cut my hair the last few times I went and does one HELL of a job. Nothing like feeling safe when getting your hair cut and walking out happy in style. Thank you Rocklin barber shop!<//Text>

Matt and Tim are great we miss Bill Bill and were so lucky to have had him cut 3 generations of boys hair for so so many years!    My husband drove 2 hrs each way once a month when we didn’t live in the area.   Wish we could drive there now but 3000 miles is a bit of a stretch ;).  Keep up the good work!!!!</Text>

Best place around to get a haircutcut. Matt knows what he's doing. You cannot even compare to the franchise haircut places. Call to make a reservation. Me and my son won't go anywhere else for our cuts.< /text>

<Review>Best Barber in town! Tim is my go to barber but the rest of the team is also great! I've noticed Thursday mornings 30 minutes after they have open is the best time to go since there's no wait. When you visit ask them about the story behind the wood floors.</Review>< rating>

All of the barbers are very competent at what they do. They do haircuts of all ages! I've seen kids here that love it and seniors that have gone here since the place opened. Walk ins are always welcome here, and feel free to choose a specific barber if you'd like. Great place!< /review>< name>

Not a bad haircut but was very rushed, took maybe 10 minutes, didnt offer to put any product in, then was already working with someone else before I could even get my wallet out to pay. Would have been nice if he took some more time and was more detailed.<//Review>

For years I went here and I always knew it as Barber Bill's. I got my very first hair cut here and they made the experiences after that as fun as they could. I remember my cousins and I would get little leaguers here all the time. Only reason I don't get my haircut here anymore is because of the distance. If the barbers are anywhere near as good as they were when I was little, it is worth every penny. Thank you for being a memorable part of my childhood.< /Review>

This is a decent barber shop that usually does a pretty good job. My haircut was a shorter than I expectedn but they generally do a good job. They charge $20 for a haircut. There are no frills here just walk in, sit down and walk out. Although they did use a straight razor to clean the back of my neck which was a nice touch.< /Text>

<text>These dudes know how to cut hair, it's got an old school feel to it but you'll feel right at home. It's a bit on the pricier side at 20$ but well worth it if you want your hair cut right.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809b1f107a804df1:0x126596dd843379c2</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Started going here when I was a toddler. Moved away for 10 years, came back, and they're still going strong! I don't like waiting for a favorite stylist, and I don't have to because they're all great!, detailed and friendly.<//review>

<text>Rocklin Barber Shop is the best place to get a men's haircut in my opinion. Every time I go I get exactly what I asked for and even better than I can imagine. They take the time to get to know you and make you feel like you have been going there for a long time. The decor is one of a kind and a great tie to the community. The iceing on the cake is that they take the time to put the finishing touch on your haircut to straight razor your neck. I recommend a haircut from Rocklin Barber shop for an all around amazing experience.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>Finally found a barbershop and barbers who know what they are doing. And their attention to detail is un-paralleled. Have been looking for a barber since my move from the Bay Area. And I know I have found one. Will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
This was my first time going here. I normally just go to great clips as my hair is short and it's not very hard to get what I want. Great clips hiked their prices so I tried an actual barber and went her. I asked the guy to even out the top, do a mid-skin fade and put a hard part in and pointed at my head. He said no problem. My hair is significantly shorter, which would be fine if I weren't starting to grow the combover look back out, thus the hard part. Now I have a short hair cut with a random, thick line cut into the side of my head in the wrong spot. It looks really stupid and I have to wait a while for the part to grow back out before I can have it fixed. I know its just hair but I am really not happy with it. It also cost me as much as Great Clips. I wish I would have just gone there.</Review>

The barbers here were all amazing. We had a few people recommend bringing our 3 year here after having multiple bad haircuts at Jack n Jillybeans. The barbers here came recommended from our daycare, Merryhill School, in Rocklin. We had a great experience, got a great haircut, paid less, and will definitely be back. Thanks, Michelle, for a great haircut! Thanks also to Barber Matt and Barber Tim!</text>

The worst and most expensive hair cut I've ever had. Not a single instruction was followed by the barber I believe to be named Tim. The power went out mid haircut and all the employees immediately started to cheer about getting off early. It was very obvious my barbers focus shifted from my hair to the early release. Complete lack of professionalism<//Review>

<Text>Paul was a big help. I called him a few times last week. I bought a 1998 Chevy K3500 that had a missing problem. They did a tune up and ran some fuel injector cleaner through the system. As well as found a cracked exhaust manifold. Ruben the mechanic did an awesome job running the plug wires on top of the valve covers. And installing the new exaust manifold. Looks to me like this shop has a good team of guys,  and know how to get things done. I will be using them from now on. Thank you Paul and Ruben for the Quality work!</Text>< pics>

<text>I needed a star certified smog check and drove by Vehicle Repair Center so i decided to give them a try. The shop looked busy but they got me in and out fast! I brought my wife's car for repairs a few weeks later and I am beyond satisfied with the customer service and the quality of work I get from this shop.  I recommend VRC to anyone looking for an honest mechanic with affordable pricing.<//text>< UserId.>

Went today to get my brakes fixed, frantically calling around for quotes, I got ahold of VRC through a recommendation and was not disappointed. The customer service was great, they were super knowledgeable about what my options were and worked with me to get my truck on the up and up. I can honestly say that now i feel safe driving. Definitely recommend; will be returning again!</Text>

<text>I have known two of the people that worked there for years when they were with Baldwin Automotive in Moreno Valley.  They are a very reputable place to take your car for repairs. They never insist on something being repaired. They leave that up to you and their prices are very very fair. Cecilio owns the repair center and Paul Baldwin is the person I always deal with and making appointments; many times it’s a last minute thing and he just tells me to just bring it in And the repairs are done with in a half hour</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I came here on a referral from Victor and Nicole. They are always telling me how great these guys are, and how they do honest work. I was worried that my car was breaking down because of the horrible sound it was making. It ended up being a small fix and my lord I was so grateful. I have been ripped off by mechanics in the past and always put off getting work done on my car for fear of the same thing happening again. I am glad I found this shop. It was easy for me to get there, right off the freeway and I even got some tacos next door while I waited. A+ in my book.<//text>

<Review>So I asked for a oil change and to check all fluids. A week later I start noticing a leak so I go back and tell them that I had came there for a oil change not to long ago and I noticed an oil leak. He looks around under the hood and see's the dots of oil on the bottom. He suggested that the radiator was the problem and I needed to change it quickly before it becomes worse. It sounded fishy so I took it to Top Dawg Repair and they saw that the oil leak was coming from the oil filter which was missing the adapter seal. This affected the chain, loss in oil and the extra oil to keep lubed till maintenance. A oil change of $75 ended up to be a bigger thing and went up to about $224.18 due to the mistake of leaving the adapter seal off. Waste of money! If it was done right the first time non of this would of happened.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) Take my car to make an engine oil change. My car had no problems, not a light on me.
When I delivered it I had the "check engine" on. And it shook a lot. I asked him what happened last?
He told me that I have brought it to him.
It bothered me because I know my car and I always give it good maintenance and so I had not brought it.
He told me to go to Chekar not to worry me.
After chekarlo he told me something about a coyol and gave me a bill of $ 80 for the diagnosis.
I called the police and I couldn't do anything because the car is on their property and I couldn't deliver it until I didn't pay.
I had no other to pay and carry it on a crane.

Lleve mi carro a hacer un cambio de aceite de motor. Mi carro no tenia problemas, ni una luz me prendia.
Cuando me lo entrego tenia el "check engine" prendido. Y temblava mucho. Le pregunte que avia pasado?
Me dijo q hasi se lo avia traido yo.
Me moleste xq yo conosco mi carro y siempre le doy buen mantenimiento y asi no se lo habia traido.
Me dijo que lo iva a chekar que no me preocupara.
Despues de chekarlo me dijo q algo de un coyol y me dio un bill de $80 por el diagnostico.

<Text>DELICIOUS coffee!! 😋 😋Perfectly roasted  ☕️This is a bright and airy place that's great for starting your day.  The service, the price, the quality of coffee and desserts, the ambiance & the energy radiating from the staff- all are first-rate. You get a choice of almond, oat, or soy milk with your espresso or coffee drink. The staff is SO friendly and awesome owner!< /Text>< userid>

<review>Cute and delicious cafe and a truly hidden gem of a lunch spot for those in the UTC area. A few blocks from the mall and you're on a peaceful (albeit manmade) lake complete with waterfalls and trees surrounding. Cafe sits on a dock extending into the little lake. My only complaint is their not open weekends, but I imagine most of their business comes from office workers so I understand. 😅</review>< user>

This is an awesome hidden place, the owners Leticia and Michelle are amazing, they provide such an excellent experience making you feel a valuable customer.
They also have great drink menu options and grab and go food.
The space is just unbelievable cool, is great for work or study, right in front of the cafe there’s water cascade giving you that nature vibe.

I very recommend it!</Review>

The best coffee shop in San Diego! Besides for having amazing drinks (Bee Mine & Chai Lattes are my favorite & the most delicious fresh baked goods) the views and ambiance are unmatched. It’s very quiet and the sounds of the pond make it the perfect place to set up your work station. Especially being stuck inside during quarantine, this coffee shop is the perfect little get away to sit in the sun and still be productive during the work week. There is ample room to sit, drink your coffee and work all while staying a safe distance apart from others. Highly recommend!!
Also the owner/barista is a babe!<//Review>

Normally I love this place for studying but my last experience here was horrendous. I arrived to the cafe in the late afternoon not knowing it was after closing hours. Just as I walked into view of the cafe, a custodian intercepted me and aggressively chastised me for being on private property. She trailed me to my car and overtly photographed me on her cell phone as I was leaving. I will never come here again for fear of being unprofessionally harassed by building staff.< /Review>

{'time': 1617752353089, 'text': 'Hello Kari\nWe are so sorry you had this experience with the after-hours security at the La Jolla Reserve Property. Cargo Cafe La Jolla Reserve is located on private property, and they do have security that roams the property after hours.  We are fortunate that the landlord allows Cargo Cafe customers to stop in during our hours of operation for a yummy drink or delicious treat and relax, study, enjoy the beautiful green space, they just ask it is done during our hours of operation. Cargo Cafe is open Monday through Friday 7:30am through 2:00pm.\n\nWe understand that this kind of experience is unacceptable and we will make sure to talk to the security team to see if they can be more informative with our customers or non-property guests to explain the property’s after-hours policy.  We would love for you to come back and visit us during our cafe hours and we can treat you to your favorite drink!'}<//response>

Every drink is crafted with care and the consistency of the flavors are on point. Hungry? Well they got your back there too. From breakfast burritos, gourmet salads and sandwiches you can easily grab a meal on the go. Ohhhh and be sure to check out the pastry case. Too many yummy things to choose one. They also carry a wide variety of bottled beverages which I like. Things like kombucha, water, sodas, etc. The staff are very friendly and you can tell they take pride in what they do. They also have outdoor patio seating available.  If in the area, I would definitely recommend you check it out.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Cargo café is a great find around UTC area. I have some time afternoon and I go there to work on my computer, fast internet, great after-lunch coffee and trying-to don’t eat those amazing cookies. Leticia is a sweetheart and is always around to make sure I’ve been taking care of!< /Text>

<Text>Cargo is by far the best cold brew I’ve ever had!

Found out about this spot through a friend and became my favorite place in san diego to get some work done or meet with friends (the views of the pond and waterfall are incredible)

They also have high speed wifi, 15+ tables surrounded with heaters, and all follow covid guidelines, and you can’t beat the free visitor parking!

Definitely recommend this spot - their customer service is better than Starbucks!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We tried this place because of other reviews, however, unless you work in the office complex it's a challenge to find. Google maps brought us to the north side of the office complex and we had to walk around and through a couple of buildings before finally spotting it. We thought it was a brick and mortar place but it's an outdoor tent near the man-made pond. The pond is currently under renovation.
The coffee itself was decent. The workers were friendly. It just wasn't worth the effort it took to find.< /text>

I like this coffee, it’s a short walk around my work and has a good place, worth the walk.

Tip, the cart is in the middle of the office buildings.< /text>

Food is quick and hot but don't expect to get what you ordered.  I ordered Honey Seasame chicken, had no honey and no Seasame seeds and no veggies.  Yucky, dried out, breaded chicken with no flavor.  The noodles were good though.  Won't be going back to that restaurant.< /Review>

This place is currently FALSELY ADVERTISED as OPEN and it is NOT OPEN. This is a huge inconvenience for people, it is irresponsible not to post this place as closed or temporarily closed. Don't waste your time with their false advertising on Google.< /Review>

I went Christmas shopping and decided to get something to eat at this location. The food was delicious like always, but Susana who was my cashier ,not so good at customer service. I asked her for hot sauce and I extended my hand out and she placed it on the counter. I work in customer service and I believe that any iteam should be placed on the customers hand. I asked her if on the recipe there was a survey I can do,  and her response was "I don't know, check!"</review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Always consistent with food quality. I see the same staff every time I go, and they are quick to greet you and kindly lead you along the ordering process. Nothing abrasive, nothing condescending, just employees dutifully doing what they're supposed to. A couple of times, when it's super busy (around 1:00 P.M.) they have botched orders due to the pressure and lack of communication. Can be frustrating especially if you're pressed for time. That usually does not happen though, but be prepared to spend an extra few minutes there if it seems busy there. Otherwise, it's good food well worth the price. Take advantage of the half-and-half chow mein-fried rice option!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2955ab6c953d1:0x9b129ee58de1f9e1<//GmapID></record>

The food here is just plain out trash and over priced.
The fried rice taste awful no flavor of seasoning or at least some salt. It didn’t even taste like fried rice to begin with, the chow menu clearly  was a day or 2 old super dry and chewy. I don’t recommend this location
I go to the one on Laurel Cyn & Roscoe and never had issues. I also got food poisoning from this place maybe it was the Kung Poa as it was undercooked.
I won’t be returning and I will be reporting my experience to the Burbank Health DOLA< /text>

<review>I just saw a server put back food from a customer that didn't want it on the serving tray to be served on the next customers!!! I'm sure it's a violation of  food safety standards ....or maybe it's just me and I don't like eating food that came from another person's plate!< /review>< Pics>

The owner is a miser! He intimidates   his employees and he should hire someone else. He cuts the amount of food. Less than all of the other pandas and they charge more: food is is not heated properly. The health department should visit him. Don't go there. The franchise should kick him out. It may be a racial issue he has. I will boycott all pandas until he is dealt with.< /text></record>

Food was good.  I got there early and many entrées were not ready yet so they made Beijing Beef fresh to order for me. Yum!

I lost/forgot my credit card there yesterday and when I came back today they verified my id/license an gave it to me. Happy dance!< /review>

I work in this mall, so I'm in the food court for lunch frequently. I've eaten at this Panda Express maybe 4-5 times, and each time I've gotten ill from it. I kept thinking maybe it was a fluke, but I'm deciding that today is the last time I'm gunna let this place mess with my insides. I don't have this issue with any other  Panda Express location, so I don't know what the issue is.
On top of giving you the runs, they also don't make good fried rice or chow mein, the food sits out too long, and the managers clearly don't treat their workers well. As a fellow mall employee, I feel bad.<//text>

Amazing workers & food but I’m very disappointed when I ordered food i got a Fortune cookie and everybody knows that a Fortune cookie has a script little piece of paper and once I started to break it, the fortune cookie didn’t even have a “Fortune” it was  just a cookie<//text>

Good food selection...most items including specials are reasonably priced. The establishment is centered around the bar and food is not the main draw. Bar patrons can occasionally really dominate the place with associated bar behavior.
Not a problem at lunch at all....and can be quite pleasant.
Outdoor dining space is small...but can be quite. pleasant<//Text>

<Text>Went here after a softball game. They have daily food specials which is great. I got the mountain of chicken wings which is seriously a mountain. The best part is they really batter and deep fry them there, not previously battered and frozen. They have a great beer selection and my all my buddy's food looked good too. Chicken wrap, pasta and fried avocado. I'd definitely come back when in the area.</Text>< response>

<Review>They have a small menu for dogs!
I had the tuna melt, and it was pretty good, but the french fries were nothing special. Nice staff as well, though it took a while to get the bill. It seems like you can seat yourself or need to be seated, depending on the time of day. A lot of their serving sizes are way too small. I got The Lauren on another visit, expecting the six shrimp to be of reasonable size, but they were tiny. Definitely not enough to fill me up.<//Review></record>

< Review>
I had this place bookmarked for years and I finally got to try it. I wish i came here sooner. Service was amazing, you get free iced coffee and nacho chips that tasted so buttery good. Unfortunately I didn't get to take any photos but the seafood udon, animal style fries, and kimchi carbonara pasta was amazingg. If only I lived closer cause I am craving the carbonara as I type.  It was sooo good!!</Review>

<user>105134118456574092742< /user><review>This sports bar appears fairly upscale, but underneath the surface lies a very mediocre experience.  Service is habitually slow - other tables could be overheard discussing this - and the food is quite overpriced while not on the weekday special deal, which still only brings it to an average value.  The meats were well seasoned, but everything else from the beans and rice to the taco condiments and tamale wrappings tasted store-bought and hastily "prepared" at best.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Experience a piece of Paris here at this quaint spot and their delightful sidewalk seating. Most come for a drink, a small plate, or perhaps a selection from their elegant pastry selection, but their dinner menu looks like it's worth a try too. Love the friendly service and Old World feel!<//Review>

<text>More lively out loud speaking voices of consent thanks discerning previous people with unsatisfied grimaces eating artichokes and Escargot
Very lively friendly mostly French Hispanic or Continental us plus some new European young visitors most probably work permits I would only assume so.

The food was outstanding in authentic French style.  The staff was impeccably dressed and thoroughly knowledgeable and helpful.   Even watching patrons was a unique experience too: how they dressed, talked, walked.  We felt special in the bistro among special people...<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Delicious, but PRICEY. (approximately $30-$50 a person) Service is above-average, but just. Attention to detail is there, and their homemade bread and strawberry jam is really well done. Lots of cocktails to choose from, as well as salads, sandwiches, and rich French entree’s.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Franchise style kitchen. Location is 4 out of 5, but accommodation of guests 3 out of 5 - it is too close to road and there is no any protection at all. See my photos and video under review and assess by yourself.
Benefits are: delicious dishes and happy hour till the midnight. Recommend</Text>< pics>

I had to request a steak knife in order to cut the $35 filet mignon (medium rare) after failing to cut through it with the knife provided. It honestly felt like I was eating a much cheaper cut of meat.

Your local grocer has a frozen french onion soup that tastes better than this place's.

Also, many restroom trips were required by myself and my date upon returning home.

Good french fries though.<//text>

Very poor service.  It's Monday and not too busy.  Waiter screwed up my order and the busboy corrected it with no mention from the waiter.  Water glasses never refilled.  Didn't see our waiter since he took our order.  Didn't come by to check on our meals.

I'm not a picky person and seldom complain, but I just had to say something.<//Review>

Lovely service, and the food was delicious! Socially distanced tables, each with separation plexiglass from each table, and outdoor dining too! Brilliant spot! 👍🏽< /text>

<text>Since I moved to Chicago 4 years ago, I haven't been to Figaro Bistrot for at least that long if not more. Which is why I was so delighted to see that the food and experience has gotten even better and even more beautiful than before. How is that even possible? Not to mention Covid hasn't had any impact on the quality of the food or service. Last but not least...they love dogs!!</text>< Rate>

<name>Jamie< /name><date>1536428087499< /date><rating>4</rating><review>I guess your experience would depend on what you’re looking for. I was looking for french style brunch and I got disappointed.

Their service was on point. Super kind and attentive.

Their latte came out in a b.o.w.l. It was huge. Didn’t expect to see that at a french restaurant! The taste was alright...

We ordered from their menu everything we ordered didn’t meet our expectations. My croque madaam(? Can’t remember exactly) had a bunch of cheese and really I could taste nothing but the cheese. The salad was over-dressed and soggy. Their potatoes were bland and undercooked. The pricing seemed quiet steep for the quality of food.

We enjoyed the historic vibe though. It’s such a quaint and exotic vibe and the old interior is well preserved.

If we go back here next time, it will probably be to try their pastries from the case— not the food from their menu.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORLCrlz8y5z3Y-Fd0hd1QI0BMuN-qSogFLT3cS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2dfTIrXdKVdRexoO6Z-pu5c_alRMLcW25orvq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO66_gt8tzF1rUZcKWoPiPiP4z2-0e8eKecfv0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXdLZT5-eazdBuoDShl7Yc88sneFK4KQ445haQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa7aEueEPq2c1pTUCLZlnIXzTpz9Ew66z-2Urx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1GsfMjxmpshb0j1cVDnPE_rnSjGjJBUEUrKD-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5mOG1IHxjjicuze0J6T79muKm64w_w-rtigAM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjuXxEab9RamLJ_tPuRwAGGHU4yV5WA-pIvMeW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUnX7_a-xyyPvDyL5BUNp_X_sc2MTztbEor9V4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH-EDIeZvRbuBIAMwDHe7f5HFTayZVOs0NRwda=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvnisnmpzxrqhkfmEcZTBnfJSs6ydxr_NSf5Bh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvEKbb2X_l85kPbGsuDySPKzse-2FvoFre5hxH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2c0aeee51ffb5:0xb2f24102f8a608c8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Amazing place with very delicious food and cozy atmosphere. My favorite salmon was awesome and prepared as I asked well-done. The best cake I tried there is chocolate one, tropeziene is fine for those who like the cream w/ alcohol flavor. In general, the place is very nice and I felt there a little like in some small cafe in Europe, located on some narrowed street. Sometimes I miss it in US places.<//Review><user_id>112167599098746671443<//user_id><username>Людмила Д</username><Time>1582610008754<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<date>1603488696402<//date><Review>My wife and I had been looking forward to coming to this place for quite a while. We showed up to the restaurant and 3 servers walked right pass us until my wife stopped one of them. She finally took her name and number down and told us to “take a lap” meanwhile they called us, I’ve never heard a Host/Server tell a customer that. She said it would take about 15 minutes; we waited 1 hour and nothing. This is really disappointing and aggravating, I really expected better of this place. I don’t know if it was because of the way we looked or the way we were dressed but for sure we are never coming back.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2c0aeee51ffb5:0xb2f24102f8a608c8<//GmapID>< userid>

<text>My wife and I had been looking forward to coming to this place for quite a while. We showed up to the restaurant and 3 servers walked right pass us until my wife stopped one of them. She finally took her name and number down and told us to “take a lap” meanwhile they called us, I’ve never heard a Host/Server tell a customer that. She said it would take about 15 minutes; we waited 1 hour and nothing. This is really disappointing and aggravating, I really expected better of this place. I don’t know if it was because of the way we looked or the way we were dressed but for sure we are never coming back.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Very nice to see them open for guests right after the shut down. They are clean, quick and efficient. The food is delicious as always. And to top it off, full menu. Others are serving at limited menu. They know what they are doing. And Happy Hour is still available! Always a plus!< /Review>

french food and the scene here is very good. This place does it for me. The service was sociable and attentive. Bring your appetite because portions are large. Reminds me of a cafe in Chicago I loved to visit.<//Review>

It was cute inside and everything appeared to be fresh. Outside was where my friend and I sat. We ordered a chocolate almond croissant and it was amazing! The coffee and tea were lovely too. I ordered cordon bleu as well. The mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had, and those veggies 😍. Everything was delicious. There were a lot of homeless outside though. If I ever go back, I will sit inside.</Text>

<review>The staff was friendly and it had an old vintage feel; so much so that the chairs were falling apart. I ordered orange juice listed as "freshly squeezed" but it tasted and had a texture of being the concentrated juice, terrible. The cappuccino was really good. I ordered an omelette with cheddar, bacon and sausage. The salad and potatoes were good. The omelette was ok could only taste the sausage. Overall it was ok but not worth the price that was paid.<//review>< Name>

They have unsafe outdoor dining everyone is packed and you can’t even let pedestrians sadly pass I cannot support a selfish business that puts their workers their neighbors and customers at risk it’s really disgusting to see everyone so close just get take out from somewhere else awful< /review>

<review>Dining is only allowed outdoors in LA now, tables were setup on the sidewalk next to the street trying to allow service for as many people as possible.  Service was average, restaurant was really busy and probably under staffed, cussing delays in order taking and delivery of check.  Food was served quickly once our order was taken.  Ordered the cordon bleu, it was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The vegetables were excellent, but chicken was a little dry and swiss cheese was on the light side.  Happy hour drinks were a great value.</review>< Pics>

I ordered the pancakes ($12.50) and received two extremely dry pancakes with a dab of whipcream and some day old strawberries.  When I asked for additional syrup, I had to ask 3 different servers to bring me some. At that point, the pancakes were cold and I was no longer interested.

Very dissatisfied with the food and service. Definitely don't waste your time or money here.<//text>

<text>This place is great! After all, it was my #1 choice to have my first and only blind date there :)

For all French, and international breakfast lovers, this place offers a fine variety of baked goods, along with great tasting breakfast. This place also seems to be a bit of a crossover into America by offering menu items that represent fine American dining.

Food appears to be made fresh with quality ingredients as everything taste really good. Keep in mind that this particular place is NOT a fast food restaurant and therefore your food might take a minute to come out. Also, the place is very popular and will fill up rather quickly on weekends. Come early to enjoy either a cozy spot in the couch area inside or sit outside at one of the lovely round tables. Staff is very accommodating and food can be customized, so don't hesitate to ask. Last but not least, make sure to check out their desserts. Everything is really delicious.

Only challenge with this place is parking. If you use public transportation, come with the red line train and exit on Sunset Blvd station. Walk North toward Hollywood and you will find it on the right hand side on Vermont. As mentioned earlier, if you come by car, parking can be difficult on the weekend. You might need a minute to find something as this restaurant does not have any parking options. This is rather a true neighborhood gem.<//text><date>1545837097057< /date>< user>

When my girlfriend and I first arrived to the restaurant, I was a bit confused because there isn't a sign outside saying "The Little Door." It's basically just a door. When you arrive there isn't a parking structure or any parking. The only opinion you have is valet parking which is $5-6 I believe.< /text>

Used to be wonderful, but the quality of the pastries deteriorated. Staff is always friendly and the spot is nice. The small tables outside make you feel like at a bistro in Paris, and the inside has a cosy, comfortable feel to it.< /text>

The waiter spent more time texting on the phone rather than paying attention to the customers and messed up both orders when he did pay attention, the wait for what we ordered was so long it felt like Grub-Hub was delivering our food from far away with a busy traffic.
I don't recommend this place, it lost its charm and French flair, they need to change the staff and the chef. I am willing to gamble that it won't last long as that Restaurant.
Spend your valuable Dollars at a better location guys.< /Review>< pics>

Absolutely amazing atmosphere. The staff are knowledgeable and accommodating. The food was to die for. So authentic and thoughtfully prepared. The wine and cocktail selection were exciting and reasonably priced. I highly recommend this location. Wanna impress a girl? Take her here.< /Review>

I also polished off the complimentary warm, crusty slice of bread with rich, creamy butter. In between large bites and blissful chewing, I peered frequently at my dining neighbor's tantalizing meal. With four glasses of wine, our casual lunch ended up costing but well worth it.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A horrible experience! We were treated poorly. We were celebrating a birthday. The waitress put our cake in the refrigerator and then proceeded to tell us that if we wanted to cut our OWN cake they would charge us $4 per person! Racist, terrible place!!

<text>The prices are steep but it goes with the territory. To get to the restaurant, you will need to take the elevator to floor 2 or 3. I can't exactly remember which floor it was on but it's definitely one of the two. For a classy day or night out in the city, I'd recommend.< /text><Rating>4<//Rating><gmapID>0x80c2c0aeee51ffb5:0xb2f24102f8a608c8</gmapID>< user_id>

Cute place - feels like you're in someones living room. Very intimate and dark. There's two sides to the restaurant on top of the outdoor seating. Got the steak salad. It was good but would probably want to try something else next time.<//text>

This is the French Bistro the neighborhood needs. Beautiful decor, romantic, and a great location.</review>< date>

<review>It's my go-to French restaurant in Los Angeles. It's exactly a cafe bistro that's both casual, elegant and authentically French. They say if you go to Paris every restaurant you walk into is pretty good. Well, I've never had a bad dish at Figaro.

<pics>None< /pics><Date>1547522520373</Date><text>Wow. The worst customer service I have had in a long time. After my order was delivered completely wrong.... two soups I might add. The waitress did not feel like she could talk to us? She did not like anyone yelling at her. My friend and I were soooo shocked we laughed. Neither of us even raised our voice. We asked that our soups be made to go. After speaking with the manager to no avail, I called to leave a message for the owner. I’m a long time customer. The waiter refused to tell me the owners name. Mind you I did not ask for his number just wanted to leave a message. The waiter hung up. Ok well. Guess I’ll no longer be a regular. Such a shame. What ever happened to common customer service.<//text><userid>116975872323491693243<//userid>< Gmap_id>

This bistro is intimate,extremely clean and has an elegant decor.The staff is attentive, affable and professional. I enjoyed a German Riesling, coffee and the lusciously rich lemon pound cake.The cake was extremely tasty and deliciously rich with a bite of lemon frosting on top.What I was not able to finish was boxed for a trip to home.For a quiet and peaceful nite cap, this bistro is a place that I will revisit.<//Text>

<review>The happy hour here is the best on Vermont. Careful tho' the bar is pretty cozy and small. I would also pick this as a place to bring a date. Outside seating is awesome. I truly love this little place. Parking is the back if you don't want to valet.

I have only been to this Bistro once when I took my mother for lunch. I did not care for our lunch at all. The menu was quasi French in my opinion. The place looks old and dingy although very nicely decorated with a Frenchie motif. There is some delicious-looking pastry in the middle of the restaurant that I didn't see on the menu. The outdoor seating is absolutely filthy as well as the awning which hasn't been cleaned or swept in years. The place has great potential if someone would just take care of it better. It looks to be well-attended by hipsters on the weekend.< /review>

The service is ALWAYS GREAT. The pastries, bread & Eggs Benedict are the best in town. Great Cappuccino too. But disappointed by a lot of the meals. On probably my 100th visit my quiche was BURNT & I can't believe it was even served. Not 1st time a meal was ill prepared. But will go back for the good I praised.

Parking is tough in all of Los Feliz. Meters & street. @ Nights & weekends they have Valets.<//text>

After six years living in LA and going almost every weekend for brunch, I can say that this little intimate Parisian style "bistro" breakfast/lunch/dinner place in Los Feliz is amongst my favorites (if not my favorite for brunch). I think what makes it special beyond its neighboring business is the placement of the outdoor sitting, reminiscing so well of the way that we Europeans spend outdoors, watching people while eating or drinking coffee, right next to them, passing by us...<//text>< Resp>

Food, service, and atmosphere. This bistro has it all. The good came out at a perfect temperature, was extremely tasty and delivered a sizable portion. I love to eat and had to take home half my “sandwich du poisson asassoiné.” Our French press was extremely tasty.

Service is fantastic. Our server, Maati, was attentive, personable and present without being intrusive.

Atmosphere is noisy, but not to the extent that you can’t a conversation. It was busy for Sunday brunch, but not packed to the brim.

I will be returning soon!</Text>

I loved the sidewalk dining at Figaro Bistrot.  We went for lunch, and though they have plenty of seating inside, the sidwalk tables under the awnings beckoned us.
Our food was spot on and reasonably priced.  I had a delicious Croque Madame with a perfectly poached egg.  My dining partner had " the best omelet" he's had in awhile with a salad and croissant.
Coffee is served in proper French bowls.  The waiters are professional, excellent but maintain a professional air and don't get overly chummy.
I look forward to returning!< /Review>

So interesting place very close to Hollywood and Los Feliz. The furniture is amazing and you really feel to be in an old French bistrot.

<text>good but not great. the best lunch at our table was the prosciutto panini, great mix of flavors and perfectly cooked. shrimp in the decent tortellini only served to push up the price. service took forever because their computer was down and the server didn't notice. great sidewalk seating.< /text>< response>

<rate>4<//rate><review>It's what you want from a bistro - good food, wine, coffee, desert. It's a little cramped inside with big, low slung seating - if you're in the shorter side it may feel a little odd at the table. Aside from that, it's a dimly lit Art Deco / vintage space inside and a crowded line of patio seats. All the things to love about French bistro dining is here - buttery, saucy, cheesey, and fresh salads. The bread is meh, but the bistro staples are good - like onion soup gratineé. The large mocha & other large coffee drinks are in a bowl, perfect for caffeine addicts. Desserts are lovely and rich. Overall nice atmosphere and food, albeit a bit pricey for dinner. The specials have always been worthwhile, I keep waiting for paella to show up as a special again.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Great place to relax and enjoy reasonably priced, nicely done French food, breads & desserts / pasteries. There is outdoor seating; so you can bring your dog. They welcome you with their mixed bread basket that comes with butter and jam. You can buy the breads you are served.  For weekend bunch, I love ALL of their Eggs Benedict varieties; and have to order extra hollandaise sauce in order to get "enough".  Great pasteries! If too full, either share, or take 1 home!</text>

This restaurant is a true gem and the only one I know around who gives me a real feeling of France. The food is of good quality and the happy hour is the best I've encountered in my many  years in L.A. (both price wise as well as originality and choices.)
Outside seating is the best, (again for that real French feeling!), inside is divided into a restaurant (Parisian style: a bit crammed, but again, very authentic) and the lounge side that is the opposite: spacious, lighter and with big fauteuils (though not ideal for dining they do make you relax). In the middle is a bakery section, again authentic French style.
And lastly but not least I need to say a few words about the staff. First of all, plenty of it, they all work hard and are all very friendly and some of them absolutely excel. People who were not treated nicely by them or perhaps one particular server probably deserved that treatment! I've been coming here with a group of friends for many years now and from day one we were loud, demanding and we always keep adding people to our table and have some special requests and not once was that ever a problem. Racist or homophobic? Seriously?!!! Jamais!!!<//Text>

It is a hole, the floor is dirty, there are more waitresses than customers, the waitresses throwing dishes, doing a lot of noise and giving you a glance, since they are so insistent, you start to be inconfortable and you don't know if they want to rape you or they feel resentfulness, they are all Mexicans and I can tell you that you, ones you are there you start to think that that's not your place.
This place was own by a French family, 3 or four years ago was purchased by a South American Jewish guy that's a disaster, he doesn't know how to run the business and doesn't care about the tradition of a french bistrot, or manners, so the thing gets pretty rough.

They don't want European or whatever white people there.<//Text>

Terrible service.
On Valentine's day of 2018 we found a hair in the main dish, we approached the waiter who took it back and told us that the cheif is not going to do anything about it, not willing to wave it or replace. The chief didn't even bother to come and see us even after we asked for it. We have never seen anything like this. Ever.
Terrible service.
Food is not the best. Mussles are without any flavor. Chicken dish is so so.</text>

<Review>It used to be one of my fave spots in LA. The food and the service are usually good. For Valentine's day, the girls at the reception were not friendly at all and very confused in term of organization, the wine was warm and the boeuf bourguignon very bad (dry pasta and hard meat). $50 / pers for this experience??? Hope they will make more efforts in the future<//Review><user_id>118172789977536769910<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the best happy hour I have found in a long LONG while.

OMG. to die for.

How can you resist (for 2 hrs from 5-7pm) great French appetizers and $3-6 cocktails!!!

Drinks I have had: Lemon Drop (good though borderline too sweet for my personal tastes), Mini Dirty Martini (a bit watery but still potent), daily drink special which i tend to really like.

Appetizers I have had: $3 Fries (yum when hot!).. enough to share among 2-3 people, Escargot in pesto (super yum but heavy.. obviously), Beef carpaccio (probably the MOST ENJOYED AND ORDERED item on the happy hour menu).. how can you resist cheese, greens, and thinly sliced beef.

Plus complimentary varied breads (yum!) and butter.

I have only ever sat outside.. it is LA and the weather is always right! They have heat lamps, and you can request to sit at a warmer table.. they vary in warmth. But if you sit outside be prepared with a jacket on cooler days. Inside looks super cute, but I have yet to do that.

This is an automatic favorite, and I love bringing guests from out of town here. The atmosphere is great, and so is the service.

5 STARS BABY!!<//text>

I couldn't agree less with the bad reviews.  This bistro is a tiny Parisian enclave in Los Feliz--yes, you will wait longer than usual for your food.  (Fast food was, after all, invented in America.)  Sometimes the servers will not take the time to smile pleasantly or even check on you, which is fine with me since, like it or not, it's reminiscent of the service you are bound to get in France.  The Happy Hour menu is enticing and well worth it and I'll have to muster the courage to get the escargot next time; the spinach ravioli today was out of this world good.  Pastries: a little pricey, but excellent and up to European standards.  The coffee is very good (the cafe au lait is indeed very milky and served in a bowl rather than in a cup or mug so as to make it easier to dunk your pastry in it).  The manager can be seen flitting from table to table, taking orders and asking patrons, "Is it good?  Or, "Is it tasty"?  The interior is beautiful and harkens back to a more gracious, gentler time. I have never had a bad experience here and I find it to be a little taste of France right here in my own backyard.<//review>

My family and I had a terrible experience here. Food was cold, service was slow and seating ridiculous. We were placed on essentially a sofa where we couldn't even reach the table. Crazy! The tables either side of us had issues with the food as well and had to send it back to the kitchen.<//Text>

We went in by "default"...our real dinner destination was the Palermo Ristorante Italiano just up the street.   It was closed on Tuesdays and we ask the store clerk next door for a recommendation...Figaro it was.

A pleasant surprise...the Rose was dry and the Kronenburg cold...the Quich tasty and the "Soupe a l'Oignon" delicious.  Even my steak sandwich was good and the fries crispy.  Service was great and the total price acceptable.

I have paid more for less both in food and service.  All total, it was a pleasant experience...although I was set for a pizza when we left the hotel...<//review>

< Review>
It's a shame I can't give this place an absolute zero. Whoever the French guy is there is needs to be fired. Rolling his eyes at us, abusing his fellow staff members in front of customers. It was absolutely disgusting to watch. Do not eat here. The food is faux French rubbish also. Throwing garlic on food and employing a French person to serve it doesn't make it any good. Seriously, who is that waiter?</Review>
