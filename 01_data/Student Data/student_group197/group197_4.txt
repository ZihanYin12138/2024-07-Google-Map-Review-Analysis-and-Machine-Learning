< review>
Signed up for a membership with this business last year when I needed drainage work done in my backyard. This membership got me a better price on that work and also inspection of air conditioner and many other perks. My older unit checked out ok but needed Freon. Brad added today and I will say it’s a pleasure to do business with this company. They are efficient, honest and fair. The employees from appointment setting to install are all happy and professional and do the work they said they would do, in a efficient and courteous manner.  Highly recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /review>

<review>Brad lead his team in installing a mini split system in my older home. Because the home’s age, not everything went as planned and it took one extra day to complete. No one complained about the extra day chalking it up to wanting the job to be done right. Brad and the entire team were professional in my home, courteous to me and kept me informed along the way. All wearing masks the entire time, being respectful of my safety. They were also cognizant of my having dogs and always closed the gate whenever they went in and out of my back yard. They also were particularly careful to cover my floor and furniture, cleaning up debris and dust. Brad was exceptionally responsive to me from the moment he entered my home to give me an estimate. He listened to me even when I wasn’t sure of what I wanted, ensuring I got my questions answered, giving me multiple options to consider. He didn’t try to up sell any product or services, just offering me what I wanted. These were the biggest key factors in choosing Crystal Blue Plumbing and Heating for my home project. I highly recommend Crystal Blue and will keep them 8n my contacts for future plumbing and heating needs.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>**Updated 3/16/2021** Drew did a wonderful job installing our new gable & whole house fan. We noticed we had a slight burning smell when running the heater... we thought it was just some dust but glad we were persistant. He found some old insulation in a cap that was catching on fire from a previous company - he fixed it correctly and I am so thankful for his expertise. We won't be calling anyone else for our HVAC needs!

Delighted to have Drew back at our personal home for the next round of maintenance, upgrades and new installs. We appreciate their attention to detail, prompt response and wonderful support staff.< /text>< pictures>

You always read reviews and hear stories about plumbing companies that are late to a job, never return calls, leave the job site a mess, and costs that require a second mortgage on the house.
Crystal Blue Plumbing and especially Brian (Plumbing Manager) Kylie, and Nathan are outstanding representatives of their company.  You want the best price, competent workers, professionalism, and responsiveness to your questions, call Crystal Blue Plumbing.

They recently repaired two main water service lines, for two adjoining properties, that had been damaged by the roots of a 70 foot Redwood Tree.  This involved 97 feet of trench across lawns with tons of tree roots.

Work was done in a timely manner, at a very reasonable price and the site was left as found.  Neat and clean.

Outstanding service from an excellent Company.  Give them a call.</review>

<Text>This has been the best experience I’ve ever had using a plumbing service. Not only was the service from the technician Nathan courteous and skilled, the response time and quality of that service was more than I  could have asked for. We had an unfortunate toilet plug that leaked out the bottom so the toilet had to be pulled and cleaned out and then replaced. All the work was done timely and with excellence. I highly recommend Crystal Blue Plumbing Heating and Air!!!</Text>< name>

So impressed with the service I received from Cody Simpson. Not only was he on time or early to all appointments the communication advising when he was going to be there was very helpful. He came out Tuesday and I already have my new water heater 2 days later. He was very personable and took the time to explain all my options. Left no mess behind (very much appreciated) Did I mention they provide a 2 year warranty AMAZING!
Happy customer for sure.</text>

Cody was very friendly and courteous and on time. We appreciated him calling and texting in advance to let us know when he would arrive. He installed our new Delta kitchen faucet very quickly and showed us how to operate it. Cody cleaned up the area before he left. This is the second time we have used Crystal Blue Plumbing. Cody did such a great job repairing our master bathroom faucets we decided to have him come back to install our new kitchen faucet. We would definitely use them again!<//review>

I had water coming up from the ground and I had no idea what was going on. Nathan explained in detail what he would do if I accepted his estimate; which was not overly priced for all the digging he and Kyle had too do. He’s assurance and having the extra help with Kyle made the job that easier and they did a very professional and fenomenal job. I will definitely would do business with them soon.

Cody was great! He kept us well informed throughout the entire installation and even tested the quality of our water.  If you want someone who is  professional,  knowledgeable about the project, and cleans after himself,  he is your man! Thanks for a job well done! 👍<//Text>

<review>We decided to change all of the bathroom fixtures in our new home from brushed nickel to flat black.  We got everything changed out except the on/off lever in the shower.  We tried everything to remove it but the hard water calcium deposits had bonded the fixture to the pipes and we were afraid of breaking the pipe.  We called Crystal Blue Plumbing because they had installed a custom shower fixture for us before.  Cody called ahead as promised and arrived on time.  He went over the costs and explained what might or might not happen when trying to replace our fixture.  Cody was able to remove the old fixture and make the new fixture work and made sure that the controls worked properly and we were getting sufficient water flow and hot water.  We are very happy with his work and would recommend Cody and this company to our friends and family.</review><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

< review>
Crystal Blue replaced my furnace and A/C unit, and did a great job at a competitive rate. I was able to upgrade to a better unit than I had planned, because their rates were lower than the competitors.

However, dealing with their plumbing department is rough. We're supposed to have some kind of benefit from having our A/C +furnace replaced with them, but it's ill-defined and certainly not a benefit of timeliness or cost.

They came by once to diagnose a leak, and unplugged a drain, but root cause of the leak wasn't corrected. Later, I had a broken bathroom sink -- in our only bathroom -- and after finally arriving a week after my call, they quoted a price 3x the going rate in my zip code to install an identical replacement sink I bought at Home Depot.

I overheard the regular plumber and his manager, who tagged along, over my outside security camera talk the plumber's original price up and up. When I asked how they arrived at this $300/hr rate, the manager was non-specific and said it was to "cover their risk," and I ended up going with another local plumber who has market rates. I will not be taking advantage of their plumbing "benefit" ever again.</review>

This tech got your  tenants hot water after you left them without hot water for 5 days. Your parts were more than 40% of the call. Pricing was fair and inline with local industry standards. Yes, the technician recommended replacing the unit due to its age, poor condition and difficulty of part availability.  In no we did we force you to replace this unit, we gave you 4 options and you chose the repair option. We did not warranty your repair work because, we highly recommended the replacement. If you would answer your phone we could discuss this anytime. We are there for you and all of our customers. Again we greatly appreciate your feedback.'}< /resp><Date>1621269245932</Date>< Text>
Rip off Rip off!!!!
High pressure fraudulent sales by installer.
Force you into replacing instead of repair.
Lies telling you your unit is obsolete can't get parts.
$900.00 charge for 1 hour of work.< /Text>

We’ve just moved back from Washington and have experienced situations before where the maintenance personnel would just come and introduce themselves then get to working without ever saying a word to us then just leave!

This company flat out lied to us. Gave us initial price of $289 then a "combo deal" the second day , to repair another problem for only an additional $109.

We were charged well over $600 for the repair. A price I did not agree to. They tell you one price. Then change it in the machine.

Horrible company for lying and stealing. Will never do business again. Nor will I ever recommend this type of bs.

Highly recommend using a different company. This one might steal from you.</Text>

Ben and Nathan did a wonderful job. Went straight to work, gave me options, settled on the best solution and we’re done in a timely manner. They asked questions, asked if I had any questions and cleaned up after themselves. They followed COVID-19 protocol with masks, gloves, booties at all times. I will have them back again for other work in the future.< /text>

Michael E. worked late into one of the hottest nights of the season, in order to make our lives comfortable again. He went out of his way as a consummate professional, with his knowledge, skill, expertise and 5 star customer service, and it was greatly appreciated. He's probably the best technician I have ever hired. Crystal Blue's entire staff is also praiseworthy, as they are knowledgeable, prompt, and professional as well, and we couldn't be happier with their service. I would happily recommend Crystal Blue Plumbing, Heating & Air, to everyone I know.</review>

Grayson came out to perform a sewer scope to ensure the line from the 1930s house my clients are purchasing was in good condition. He was timely, professional, communicated well, and even cleared some small debris in the line that could easily be moved while he was running his camera. Not always easy to find a contractor/plumber who will communicate well and show up when they say they will. Won’t hesitate to recommend to future clients.</Text>

<text>Crystal Blue was able to send a technician to repair my air conditioning same day. My technician was Scott who diagnosed the issue and was able to repair it fairly quickly. He was not pushy about telling me to get a whole new system which I really appreciated. Overall I’m very happy with Scott’s professionalism and work. Would definitely recommend Crystal Blue to others.</text>< Pics>

General air conditioner service to make sure we're ready for the hot Northern Ca. summers!  Crystal blue had some do it myself recommendations for sealing the box on the wall from water running behind it as it wasn't mounted well by the company that installed the unit.  I appreciate the advice and this is something I can easily do myself.<//text>

Installed the gas line that ran for my propane to my new range. Overall good quality products above-average customer service I'll use them again.

Update 3 months later:  just had them installed a new hose bib on my upper deck. A little pricey but great quality an excellent customer service. Will continue to use them.<//Text>

<review>I could not be more happy with Crystal Blue plumbing heating and air. Our plumber Chris came out promptly and let us know when he was on his way. We were able to track his way to us the entire way! My favorite part was he didn’t try to sell us anything his whole goal was to inform us and let us know our options :) our issue was fixed promptly and with the utmost of respect for our home and property. Everything was explained to us clearly. I couldn’t be happier. They’re membership program which gives you a plumbing inspection and hvac tuneup is a huge value after shopping around. $159 is really is a deal considering it would be in the $800 anywhere else. Crystal blue will definitely be my plumbers from this day forward.

Mr Jeremy Fulton explained the whole process in terms that where easy to follow.  He went through the whole tear out  and install stage by stage.   Also he explained the other plumbing issues I had at my house.   I have to admit I was skeptical at first when I was given a arrival window of 12p to 4p.  Seems that I was going to be stuck at my house waiting.   That however was not the case.  I fact he was an hour earlier then the start of the window.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I bit pricy but I now know why.

< Review>
Grayson did an excellent job describing water heater options. There was a measurement problem that resulted in a two day install, but Grayson took full responsibility and went above and beyond to make things right. I also appreciated having an honest, polite, professional in my home. The final install looks outstanding and the water is so hot, I had to turn the temperature down. Excellent company that stands behind their employees.
I changed my rating to a 5, because I have had the water heater over 6 months and the performance is outstanding.  It's barely set to "hot" and it heats up very quickly.  Also, having other workers in my home have made me even more appreciative of Grayson's positive can-do attitude.< /Review>

Great communication and excellent service! The technician, Drew Russell- Scott, was thorough and honest. He made detailed recommendations and ordered the necessary parts to get my HVAC unit in good working order. I also asked for and received a  competitive estimate for installation of a QuietAir Pro whole house fan. I scheduled the service for last week. Installers Drew and Scott P.  did an excellent job from start to finish. I highly recommend their work and especially appreciate the attention to detail and compliance with all Covid protocols.<//Text>

<Date>1572713593022< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Brandon was helpfully informative and efficient. Very friendly. I was amazed that there was no charge for the visit (simply needed to relight the pilot on our water heater). I appreciate the thorough explanation of the estimate for a replacement water heater.

Scott came over to check our furnace unit. He pointed out rust all around the base of the unit (combo HVAC) where a drain was not installed with the unit’s AC. He gave very clear information and fixed it along with the heating inspection.

Change came over to relight the pilot light of our water heater. It had been blown out by the winds from a couple of days ago. He also pointed out some rust already forming due to improper/lesser quality installation and neglect of code observation. He also took the time to do a quick check on our other water heater close by. I love how he encouraged me to ask any questions. I’m definitely staying w/this company!!</text>< pictures>

$1123 quoted price to run about 30 feet of poly tubing and change out a few under sink fittings, all accessible. Maybe 2 1/2 hours worth of work. Plus I was told when I scheduled the appointment that if I accepted the quote they would start work immediately. Was told that wouldn't happen and maybe not even tomorrow. Jeremy was nice about it a d explained they were having issues with their call center. I didn't know I was talking to a call center when I called. If had known that I would called another plumber.</review>

{'time': 1589826803381, 'text': 'Elizabeth, thank you for your honest feedback. We appreciate the time you took expecting our arrival. Unfortunately we were not able to meet our promise. I looked into your situation and our dispatcher could have done a better job communicating a new arrival time. Were sorry and as a smaller family owned company with our great reviews, sometimes we get more calls than we can handle. When a tech gets into a big job on the first call we struggle to get to the next call in our confirmed time frame. Please accept our apology and we will always try to take our customers feed back and learn from it. Thanks Owner Tim Sjobeck.'}<//Response>

<text>I tried to do business with them. They gave me a 4 hour window of services, 8:00am -12:00pm. They called me at 11:45am to say they couldn’t make it on time, and couldn’t give me an estimate of when they could arrive. There are too many plumbing businesses out there that will have someone show up on time.<//text><username>Elizabeth Cummings</username></record></dataset><record>

Scott from Crystal Blue was able to come out to repair our AC just in time for the recent heat wave, and the work was SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive than another estimate.  The whole crew at Crystal Blue was professional and I received several reminders of my appointment.  And they were on time!</Text>

Ali came out to service our AC unit and I was very pleased with his work. He was polite, knowledgeable, and I really appreciated that he wore shoe covers in our house!  He gave us some great tips on how to care for our unit and keep it clean and running smoothly.  I received a call ahead of time letting me know that he was on his way to our house.  Great service!  Highly recommend!<//Review>

When you call a plumber it's usually not a "good time", but the tech Sean Desalvatore made the experience a lot more tolerable. He had to come back a second day to get the job completed and throughout the job answered all my questions (as well as those of my elderly parents). The final outcome wasn't quite what we had hoped for, needing to replace a section of sewer line, but we know that when that job is done it will be completed the right way and at a fair price. They should be your go to plumber!< /text>

<text>The overall service was good.  It was with someone new who is learning the industry and customer service.  My air conditioner was what was checked out and all was in good shape.  My mistake was thinking I was due for a filter change for my heater and that was not the service that was scheduled.  I Love Crystal Blue Plumbing Heating and Air!  They ALWAYS go beyond what is expected for service to the customer!<//text>< Gmap_id>

OUR HOUSE NEEDED A SECOND AIR RETURN FOR THE AC.
THEIR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES INSTALLED IT IN ABOUT 5 HRS AND THEY ALSO HOOKED UP A REGISTER IN THE GUEST BATHROOM, WHICH WAS NEVER HOOKED UP FOR WHATEVER REASON AT NO EXTRA CHARGE.
WE HAVE A YEARLY SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH CRYSTAL BLUE AND DON'T REGRET A THING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.<//Text>

<Review>I can’t say enough good things about Crystal Blue Plumbing, Heating and Air, and, especially their technician, Brandon Bury.  Brandon replaced my broken hot water heater and at another time repaired my main water line.  He has a high work ethic, is personable and very respectful.  He is the best.

<review>They sent me a nice bio of the teck that would be coming to meet me, after waiting 3 hours he showed up with a third baseman/closer. The closer did all the talking, they wanted 1200.00 to clear our a 4" drain with mud in it. I said I wouldn't pay half that so the closer lowered the price to 600.00 and said they could have it done by days end. They teck spend all his time on a tablet making it look like he was doing something important. Closer asked a canned question " how much have you budgeted for the work", who budgets for a drain issue. I said four years ago had the same thing done for 250.00 and it took 45 minutes. I expected to pay more than 250.00 since it was a few years ago. This is not what you would expect from a plumbing company. I purchased a specialty hose to connect to a pressure washer for 149.00 will do it myself. They should keep closer's where they belong in the car business.  Sure they're nice people but bad tactics for a service people need,< /review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Pricing was very fair and reasonable--about 2/3 of the amount another company had bid--and thw work was done quickly and competently. The Tech was Chanse Johnson.  He was personable and struck me as exceptionally competent.  The company was prompt.  I emailed a day ago to ask for a bid, and they sent someone out the next day.

We're new to the area, but I think we've found our go-to plumbing contractor.< /text><GmapID>0x809b19487a6db805:0xc43bf92fe02b7e9b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The response time was very prompt, and flexible when I needed to change my appointment.  Our tech, Sean DeSalvatore, was very knowledgeable, professional and skilled in what he does.   He made recommendations according to our specific problem.  The job ended up being bigger than anticipated, but he stayed until it was done.  They left our area as clean as when they came.  I would definitely call this company in the future, and will request Sean.</Review>

2nd time I've used Crystal Blue Plumbing.  Tom & Tony both did an Excellent job replacing my two water heaters (about 4 months apart).  Awesome technicians!  Both separate times they arrived prompt and both were very detail oriented and respectable to me and my home.  They do a very thorough & clean job.  This company is first class!</Text>

<Time>1564591195960</Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>Crystal Blue accommodated my request to have both my heating and air and plumbing inspected on the same morning. The plumbing fixtures were inspected by Chanse. Chanse explained and documented a possible issue with the washer's faucet. He also made much appreciated recommendations. Pete inspected and serviced my heating and air system. It is an old unit within my apartment. It has the original "dumb" thermostat. At my request he explained the thermostat  replacement alternatives and installed a programmable thermostat. He also provided info and suggestions regarding a better air filter that will reduce the amount of particulates during Sacramento's long seasons of smoke. Crystal Blue continues to employ very knowledgeable, courteous employees that are a pleasure to work with.< /Review>< Name>

$307 to snake one bathtub drain??? Jeremy came out to my home and just took pictures on his tablet of the tub that needed to be unclogged then tries to get me to purchase a membership for $200 a year on top of paying $307 to get my tub unclogged... didn’t seem to care about fixing the issue but more so just to upsell. I called a different plumber and had this done for $80 the same day.</Text>

<text>I've used Crystal Blue now on multiple occasions.  I initially found them when I had an emergency situation on a holiday weekend.  They were the only company that would respond timely without charging me an arm and a leg.
Their techs are prompt, knowledgeable, fast, and professional.  Their pricing is very competitive, and in my experience, better than most other companys. The latest tech, Tom D., did a great job!
I would highly recommend!!< /text>< user>

We asked American Home Shield what the name of the contractor used on a prior repair job was which led us to schedule an air conditioning service performed by Michael Egan 5/23/18. Michael and his co-worker were the most savvy and thorough Reefers we’ve had on this site since 1985. We gladly accepted your $159
three way annual service. GOOD JOB !

No estimate is given before coming to the house.  Fill valve in toilet replaced.  $15 part, 15 minute job and cost of $192.  Not nice.<//Text>

WOW! I called on Saturday afternoon during a heatwave 100 degree day.  One of our AC unit blower fans failed. He called right back and arrived asap. He diagnosed fast and replaced the capacitor. He checked the whole system.  Ac working perfectly. Kind friendly professional service. Will use them again. Thank you Michael!<//review>

<user_id>117110726130884070512< /user_id><text>We used Crystal Blue to fix a leak in our kitchen.   We had no idea where the source of the problem was and they could have really ripped us off if they wanted to.  It was a very simple problem that they fixed very quickly and at a very reasonable cost.  Turns out it came from an improper installation when our house was built.  So they fixed the root problem too - keeping it from re-occurring.  Cost them the future service calls they might have received if they had left it as-is; but got them our business for life.  They're the best.

Update: 2-15-13
We Used Crystal Blue to source and install a new water heater.  They recommended the right one - not the most expensive choice - the one best suited to our needs.  They installed it, took away the old one, had it all done quickly and efficiently for a very fair price.  I continue to recommend them completely!< /text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

We hired Crystal Blue for an entire house replumb. This review could've easily been a one. At first the job started out on a bad note. Tim, the owner, came out to the job site and got everything fixed up right. He put Sean on the job, who is great to work with. He showed up when he was supposed to, and he listened to our concerns and requests. Tim and Sean both made sure we were happy. They checked in with us, and followed through. They were both extremely knowledgeable, and customer service was a priority to them. Thanks for making sure our big job was done right!<//Review>

<review>On the day the plumbers arrived at 4pm of the day they said they could fix the leak and stated they had to reschedule after I took the day off work due to ordering a part. They stated it would not take more then 1.5-2 hours so they would return at 9am next day so that I wouldn't need to reschedule work as I work from home.
On the day of their return they were here at 9am sharp. They started the job and I reminded them that I had to work by 2pm. The employee and owner again stated they would be finished. At 11am I checked to see what the status was. The employee said they had run into issues. He said "I'm going to put the handles back on but you won't have water until we come back out". That was not acceptable to me as my clients use the shower.

I'm a widowed, partially disabled mother of three children and a loss of income means sacrificing medications I need or food etc so I was very upset to need to cancel work for a second day. I told them I needed them to finish the job that day.
They agreed to stay but the owner was incredibly rude and demeaning to me when I was clearly upset at missing work due to their incompetence. His own worker even was upset that the owner gave him no additional man power as this was clearly a two man job. They even had to come back out twice to “re-fix” the job, but it still was not done right and eventually my landlord had to hire a new plumber to fix their mistake. The new plumber also stated that the new plumbing handle they installed was not up to code.

The whole day was so horrible; there was a new issue after new issue throughout the day. They did not even leave till after dark of that evening.
When they finished they left a bad patch work job on the wall in my closet that they cut open and didn't put the insulation back in. The shower handle they put on was not functioning right and myself and others were being scalded with hot water due to the defective handle. The fact that  the employee was frustrated and bad mouthing the owner was proof enough of their unprofessional behavior. The owner Tim is a rude individual who has no business running a business when it comes to professionalism.</review>< Pictures>

Our A.C. went out. Crystal Blue was able to come out the same day. It was late in the day so the technician, Michael, wasn't able to get there until late but he still took all the time needed to do the job right and even found another part going bad and replaced it as well. Even as late as it was he didn't try to rush out, making sure he answered all our questions. Very happy with the technician and the service. Definitely recommend Crystal Blue.< /text>

<time>1577492661892<//time><review>I like le this firm. The last time I called them came and were just great- that’s why I called them this time.
This call went well also- the problem was identified- the wuickest most cost effective solution was identified and put in place. Jeremy- the plumbing technician was knowledgeable, efficient, professional, personable, pleasant- can’t ask for more than that. I joined their annual servicing which is a testament to their company.</review><gmapID>0x809b19487a6db805:0xc43bf92fe02b7e9b</gmapID>< response>

I would rate this company as excellent.  They were the only ones willing to come out to our home at 10p.m. at night on a Friday night and it was freezing.  Our heater stopped working.  Tim called us immediately and was quick to respond to our desperate need.  I am so thankful for a company that can respond so quickly.  Thank you Tim for your great customer service and quick service.< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I have used crystal blue plumbing twice in the last 3 weeks.  All I can say is WOW.  That fixed my toilet that I was told by another plumber that it needed to be replaced.  Daniel was the tech on both jobs.  You will not meet a more courteous man.  They were booties so they don't mark up your carpets and make sure everything is done right.  Daniel told me every step of the way what was happening and what it would cost.  I had options. Jim Schmidt Rocklin CA
He was showing me how to flush my hot water heater and discovered there wasn't a safety valve and the overflow was not connected.  They fixed it, showed up on time and did the job right.  Do yourself a favor and call them first.<//Text>< rate>

Had a water heater problem and had them came to check it out.  Turns out my circuit breaker had tripped.  They reset the breaker and I have hot water now.  They didn't even charge me.  I would totally call them again  any of my plumbing needs.  I appreciate their professionalism and honesty.  Thanks again!</Review>

The Tech showed up on time, got the job done quickly, and cleaned up after he was done.  I would definitely recommend using Crystal Blue Plumbing</Review>

I am a first time home owner.  I know scary times!  My fiancee had accidentally sprung a leak.  He quickly called Crystal Blue Plumbing, (he said later it was the first one he saw online, Thank goodness it was!) where he spoke to the owner and he talked him through how to shut off all the water.  Just that jester of being so helpful really floored my fiancee and he then set up an appointment for the next day in the afternoon.  They then called that morning to say that they had a cancelation and said they could be there right away.  (Which was great because the dispatcher had remembered that I was going to be there all day painting!  So, thoughtful)  Tom, who is excellant, came in talked to me and told me what he was going to do, got right to work and then to boot he did a free inspection of plumbing.  He completed the leak and wrote all the estimates for the work we needed to have done.  On a norm this kind of thing is extremely overwhelming for me but he was just so pleasant and nice it really put me at ease!  I am thankful we found them and look forward to working with them in the future!</Review>

Shawn is AWESOME! I called in, made an appointment and was called back with a confirmation  time frame within an hour. Shawn even called to inform me that he was on his way. He is not your typical plumer. He was polite, perfessional, clean, honest and best of all kind with my boys and dogs! And I would highly recommend him and his office to anyone! :)</Review>

We used Crystal Blue after another heating and air company condemned our a/c unit. They came out the next day in the 110 degree heat and got it up and running for a fraction of the price and on top of that fixed a plumbing problem to boot. These guys are awesome and I tell all my friends about them. They are the only plumbimg, heating and air company i will use.<//text>

<Text>I called because my ac went out, and they managed to send out a technician within two hours. The technician named Zach was very friendly and professional and had our unit up and working again within the hour. I am very pleased with the service and will definitely call again if anything goes wrong.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>We had a serious gas leaking in our guest house. I called saturday afternoon to the Crystal Blue Plumbing customer service and on the next day, sunday 8 am Tom fixed that bad leak and changed all necessary stuff on our tankless water heater.

<user_name>Angelia Sjobeck< /user_name><Review>Ruth's Chris Steak House, Roseville
I would like to share a story with you regarding Tim, Mylo, and Dwayne. These guys are the BEST! They came into out store to fix the problems that were supposably fixed by another heating and air company. Not only did they fix problems that we were told could not be fixed, they extended the life of our 5 units saving us at least $6000 per unit! LOVE THEM!
These guys are now our all around fix-it guys. They took care of our HV units, refridgerators (instalations) hot water heater, plumbing, hood vents, ovens, etc. What ever we need, these guys are here ready to work, always on time and have smiles on their faces.

I truly recommend Crystal Blue to any one, business or residential! They truly are professionals!</Review></record>

<Review>Great place, went there a couple of days ago to buy moving boxes. They have a great supply and allow you do buy on at need basis, I did not have to buy in bundles. The woman working, (so sorry I forgot your name), was so helpful and even helped carry the boxes to my car. Definitely buy moving supplies from here.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

This storage facility is incredibly clean and I like that you can pay your bills online. The only thing I wish they had were lights inside of each storage unit. If I need to search for something versus simply load/unload, I need a flashlight. Every employee has been very nice and helpful (I've dealt with three so far.)<//text>

Love this location. Very clean and office is organized. I visit my storage often, and Valerie is always welcoming with a big smile. She always make sure to ask if I need help with anything. I’ve never had a problem with this location, but with Valerie on the team now her happy personality and contagious smile just adds that much more!< /text>

My father rents at this public storage facility and he’s elderly so he needs help getting things out of his unit at times. Valery is always so nice when we go she makes sure she has a cart for us to get things in and out of the storage. She is always so happy and makes my father and I feel so welcomed. I recommend this place if you ever need storage. Two thumbs up 👍🏻 👍🏻< /Review>

I moved out at 10am on November 1st and corporate insisted I pay for the entire month of November, but the site manager went out of her way to go up the ladder and get the fee waived. Building is clean and seemingly secure. Having to punch the code into the elevator over and over while you're carrying heavy items gets difficult/frustrating.</Review>

I wanted to get some additional space for some things i had in my house. I already had a storage unit at the same place but Nestor was able to recommend the best size that would accommodate everything that i needed to store and helped me save some money in the process.  He was very helpful thank you so much.</review>

<text>I had a emergency in my home due to some water damage. My roommate went to rent a rental unit from this location while I took care of things at home. He told me how Valery was helpful and understanding of the situation. When i went to check the unit out and help take the stuff we were able to save I already knew who Valery was just by looking at her smile. Thank you for all your help and helping us get a unit that was very convenient for us in a time of emergency and short notice. Valery you are awesome!!!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

For the first time in a long time I left a business with no complaints .The young lady Kelsey is very pleasant she gives Public storage a better reputation then what you hear. She went out her way to help me load things onto a cart. And when I said it was ok her every response was no problem it's my job . If you want to have a clean environment and great customer service please do business with the Wilshire location . Great job Kelsey 👍🏻< /text>

<Review>I made a reservation over the phone, and a spoke to a woman named Jasmine.  She was very pleasant and helpful too the point where I rushed to the store to purchase a unit from her. Once my spouse and I got to the place she showed us two units. I told her about  how my day has been going . She was very professional and knew what she was doing. Her customer service was 100% (scale 1-100) I would love to see more employees with the same spirit as her. Give her pat on the back for us and thank you</Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4572957e3f:0x274ba2312d2be752</Gmap_id>< Time>

I had such a great experience with John at Public Storage. Within minutes of booking the unit online, he called me to answer any questions about the move-in date. He followed up with me leading up to the move-in and was very informative. On the day of the big move, he even gave my movers water--it was a hot day! Thanks Public Storage and John for providing such a great experience.</text>

I had a great experience with Kenneth B at Public Storage. I came into the store and was greeted professionally and with a welcoming smile. I thought I knew what I was looking for, but Kenneth went the extra step to discuss my needs and make recommendations. When all was done, I followed his recommendations. THANK YOU, Kenneth B and thank you PS!<//Text>

Spoke with Micheal for information regarding a storage space. He was very helpful. The location was pleasant to visit. Micheal helped me fine a unit closer to where I reside that was more in my price range in Hawthorne. But the location on wilshire was very nice and would recommend to other to rent.</review>

<review>Gemma at the front desk is a great representation for this office/company. She's very knowledgeable and willing to assist with any of your moving needs. I wasn't sure what exactly I needed and with a couple of short questions we were on our way to see a space. She let me know what would be the best way to store me items and showed me different items they had available to pack my items accordingly. It's in the middle of a plaza so you might miss it the first time around, I highly recommend this office because the manager at the front it's really great and personable.</review>< Date>

I went box hunting with my mother because I am moving out of my house to an apartment. We stumbled across a few places that sold them but I thought they were too expensive. Then we found this place and was greeted by kris. She went above and beyond to help me find the best and cheapest boxes. Come to my surprise she knows sign language!(my mother was born without the ability to hear) she was awesome, amazing and astonishing! Give this lady a raise!</Text>

The worst experience I have ever had with any company. I arrived and then happily signed me up for a lease... I should have noticed something was off when we took the stairs to the 4th floor... turns out the elevator was broken and they let me know once the paperwork was complete.... of course.... that is false advertising... i got to move all my furniture up 4 flights of stairs. Then I show up on a Saturday to move a bunch more things in in the middle of the day. I forgot the elevator code, so needed to go to the office. There was a note on the door saying they would be back in 30 minutes, I waited 1 hour and 15 minutes, which cost me $90 in moving fees because I had to pay them to just stand and wait and a uhaul fee for late return. Then I tried to call Lucia the district manager to see if they could at least give a credit, 3 phone calls and an email later - I heard nothing - that was 4 months ago... then I showed up to move out of the unit into another public storage because I couldn’t stand the Wilshire location for obvious reasons, and the exact same thing happened on a Saturday - I was locked out of my unit and this time, I waited 20 minutes and left. I was not going to waste another $100 waiting with movers for the second time, and be late returning my uhaul for the second time with fees. Of course, it was too late to find movers for Sunday and so I got my things Monday morning the 1st. Well, guess what.... they charged me $200 for the entire month because I wasn’t there before the day end of the month. Even though I’m renting a unit at another location already, even though I was there on Saturday with no one there in the middle of the day and had already wasted $130 the last time, even though they let me sign a lease and failed to mention the elevator was broken when it’s advertised the location has an elevator. Another customer was so angry that day he was literally throwing his things down the stairs and couldn’t believe they wouldn’t provide any compensation or credit for the HUGE inconvenience. So, I called the manager above Lucia when I let public storage know that she never returned my calls or email.... well, guess who called within hours... Lucia. She then let me know that there was absolutely nothing she could do. Not a single penny she could credit me. Nothing.

*** update! They made it right! I am so appreciative. Thank you for doing the right thing.</text>

For some reason my unit had a lock that was broken, and Edwin was a creative problem solver and spent time to get the unit open, when anyone else could have easily said too bad it's not going to open. They knew I really needed a spot on the first floor, and they made it happen! I would recommend 3010 Wilshire storage to anyone. Thank you guys for all the help!< /Review>< Pics>

Can't thank these folks, I was in a serious financial situation where both my own property and business stock were in jeopardy of lose. As a last ditch effort I reached out to public storage where the entire matter was easily and quickly misspelled. The young lady behind the counter that I believe was named Joanna took care of everything before I could even fathom it. My property. The space I needed and the security I demanded where all made available and transfers with perfection. Tell you what public storage would be nothing without the incredible employee I found that day working behind the counter. Public Storage Wilshire Blvd  location is a must for anyone who needs storage and professionalism.Thank You so much. Joanna and Public Storage< /review>

I moved from OC to Santa Monica and I needed to store some items and picked this location.  The location is really convenient and the place is really secure with a gate and elevator code and cameras.

Michael, the property manager, is really helpful, there was an issue with my unit and he called me that same day and we took care of the issue.  I recently gave my notice to move-out and he was helpful is setting the date and telling me how much the cost was and closing my account.

I do have to say that the price for the unit is kind of steep compared to other locations, but the manager is really helpful and I have not had an issue at all.<//text>

<Text>The service I received here at Public Storage was impeccable. Gemma was so helpful, and she is a truly exceptional individual and a real asset to this company. If you want a place in which you will feel secure in putting your boxed items in an even larger box that is the storage unit itself, this property is the place to do so. I highly recommend storing your stuff here.<//Text>< rating>

Cesar was very helpful and friendly and the $1 first month promotion is great! (though remember you will have to pay a $22 activation fee, $20 fee to buy a lock, and $11 for insurance, so it's not quite as cheap as you think).  Also, this site is very clean and professional.< /Text>

I just want to thank Joanna for her patience. She was so kind and available for me when i came back to do my rental. She kindly walked me thru the hallways and showed the closes spaces to the elevator due to my vison impairment. I do believe you all hired the right person for this location. Ive been going through a lot and her kindness was what i really needed at this time and i highly recommend this location to anyone looking to store their belongs during stressful moves. Joanna is simply the best!<//review>

Every time we visit our space Chiquilla always goes out of her way to show us how to use our lock because we could never figure it out. She is extremely nice and it is safe to say that this location is the best!< /Review>

I came in to buy boxes and the young lady named Gemma helping me was amazing! my daughter suggested public storage after storing at a different location. I did inquiry about different sizes for future storage needs; she showed me a few spaces that would work. I can't wait to come back mid-August to rent here. I hope every worker is just as awesome as Gemma is!</Review>

My roommates and I needed to store some stuff and at first we had no idea how anything worked or what size space we might need. When we came in, Gemma at the front was super helpful and friendly. She told us everything we needed to know upfront and helped us figure out what space would be best for us. She really took the time to answer all of our questions and we so appreciated it. We felt really comfortable after talking with her. If you have questions or concerns about renting I hope Gemma's there to help you!< /Review>

Good Luck. Do NOT purchase the lock the guy ask you to buy. He pockets that money. He tried selling my friend & i(separate times), a lock that was COMPLETELY unnecessary. He will tell you that you will “NEED” the lock. Turns out, we did not need that type of lock at all. SCAMS<//Text>

This last weekend I went to check out prices on storage locations. I'm going to be moving to the Santa Monica area. I visited this Public Storage on Wilshire in Santa Monica and Julia assisted me. She was awesome! Very professional and so nice. She took the time to show me two different spaces. Companies should have more employees like her that actually care about customer service! I will definately be back because of her! Ivette Everts</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I came in to buy some boxes and found that not only to they have a great deal on boxes but they sell different packing supplies as well. Moving and packing yourself can be quite tedious and frustrating but Christy was an amazing help! She asked me a variety of questions to see what all i was packing and helped me find what I needed for my TV and dishes. She also asked whenever I was going to be needing storage. I was unaware that they had storage since they are located on a Plaza on a busy part of Wilshire. I let her know that I hadn't planned of a storage space but since she had mentioned it I wanted to see what my options were. She showed me a few unit,  and although I didn't rent since I didn't plan on a renting a storage unit I now know where I would plan on storing since it's just down the ways from where it live. Great customer service. Thank you again Christy<//text>< Pictures>

<date>1622001965032< /date><text>It's a bit far away from the city center but at least we can say there is one 85C in the city. This location is relatively smaller so the indoor space feels compressed but it has a nice outdoor seating area.
All my favorite items are available here so I am happy with a trip to this side of the city, although I kind of have to wait for it to open, 9am opening time is definitely too late for a city bakery.<//text></record>

This place is so cute. My mom came across it on Instagram and insisted we go when she came to visit me. There was no line when we went which gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted. Their characters are almost too cute to eat and their flavors are great too! I had a salted caramel bunny. I will definitely stop by again when I'm in the area.< /text>

Small store comparing to other 85C locations. Limited selection of pastries but same drink menu & price. Great customer service with outdoor sitting area. Sea salt jasmine green is all time favorite in my opinion. Tried smoothie/slush/other sea salt drinks, but jasmine green tea is the best. $4.10 for large size. Such great deal.</review>

The hokkaido cheese tart is prettt darn tasty. Its crust is very different from the regular egg tart in that it is not layered. The regular egg tart was good too but the bottom was stuck to the foil and after biting into it, I discovered the crust was quite thick on the bottom. The custard balanced everything out though. Would I get both again. Yessir!<//Text>

<Review>I like 85c and its milk toast. This particular one is on the smaller side compared to the ones in the south bay. It however does have most of the essentials and it's nice that it has some outdoor seating. Another big plus is that it's not as crowded as the other 85c.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Went on a 4 day road trip with my granddaughter driving the entire Hwy1 coastline. Coming bk through we took a wrong turn. Granddaughter was super hungry wanting & coffee so I turned into the shopping center right by me. Decided this spot should have something quick and yummy.
OMGeeeeZuSs! The stuff they have is not only outtakes this world freaking delisious! But inexpensive...my type of spot!
Now if only they were closer to home! All are 2 or more hours away.  I know I'm keeping this address locked in and visiting when I go that way again!< /text>

<review>Staff was very attentive and friendly, and location was clean. I'm docking one star because when we came in around 9AM, many (30%?) of their pastries were not available and still baking. This might be their normal schedule but not what I was expecting.<//review>< Pics>

For a quick Asian savory beads and dessert too, this is a great place to do a quick pick up.  They have a medium selection, into been to other 85c that's larger.  The sweets are lightly sweet, the breads are typical of what we would eat for a quick breakfast.  It's a bit price than the smaller mom and pop bakeries.</Text>

I come here pretty often on my lunch breaks! The pastries are always perfectly made, and I'll usually get the passion fruit green tea with boba, which is always delicious. The prices on the pastries go as low as $1, from what I've seen! They also have seasonal treats and really creative limited-time drinks!</review>

<Text>This 1 star is specifically for the customers service. I was standing in front of the cake case waiting for help. There was a cashier to my right who did not acknowledge me at all. I wanted to buy a cake and would have spent $34 and after 5 mins she didn’t look over, I finally asked how do I order a cake. I saw countless people getting in line. She told me I had to get in line first then she would help me. Forget it. No thanks. Bad customer service.</Text></record>

<review>It was my first time checking out this bakery and everything looked mediocre, if not unappetizing. The custard tarts looked stale. To give it the benefit of doubt, I ended up ordering a couple of slides of cake to try out. The coffee creme brulee was so so and the black forest was terrible. The cream was so stale to the point that it was completely tasteless.  Besides, I don't know what kind of ingredients they use to make the cream, it was hardened with the lapse of time and yet its shape and look remained as-if fresh... Don't get fooled by the look of it.</review>< pictures>

Last time, I went to the store and discovered the mango mousse cup in the fridge was moldy.
This time, I ordered a sea salt jasmine tea which has very tiny sea salt cream on top. I will never shop there again<//text>

<review>80% of their buns and pastries are air, don't let their visible size fool you. And these buns are expensive, at least $2.
And 15 minutes for a green milk tea is unforgivable. They spend their time doing the slushies and smoothies first because it's more fun to use the blender.<//review>< gmap_id>

Pretty standard for a 85c. Service is really slow, 15 minutes for a beverage during non-busy hours. Is a standard milk tea that difficult?< /review>

<Text>Half of their items on DoorDash are out of stock but they still have it available on their menu. I had the worst delivery experience because they didn’t have the items and “couldn’t cancel the order” yet kept insisting me to substitute them with something else. After an hour of back and forth with the dasher, restaurant and DoorDash customer service, DoorDash eventually refunded me for the order. If the item isn’t available then simply mark it “out of stock” so it doesn’t create an inconvenience for your customers.</Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Coffee just fine.
Baked goods too greasy.
The plastic garbage is taken to extremes ... bad.

(Original)
Kaffee ganz gut.
Backware zu fettig.
Der Plastik Müll wird hier auf die Spitze getrieben....schlimm.< /text>

<name>Leo Su</name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Stay away, definitely a scam company.. This company is only after your money, they could care less about helping you. I had to do everything myself from looking for therapist to booking appointment to setting up a call, so I really don't know what service is provided... and the rates are super high and ambiguous, I was charged $240 for a 30min zoom call without knowing beforehand the rate of the person ( turns out the person I was on a call was not even a therapist ), and their customer service is basically non existent, I asked for a call back and they just wrote me an email basically saying "it is what it is".. so do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your wellbeing because this place will definitely make it worse.

Update: I have canceled my account two weeks ago and was told there will be no more future charges, today i woke up to another $100 dollar ghost charge with no description..</Review><Date>1621607438184</Date><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80c2bec77036b591:0xa26d467bf9dc9582< /gmap_id>< userid>

<text>Terrible service. You literally have to do all of the footwork every step of the way. The “support staff” is anything but, and usually gets in the way of what you need. My pharmacy sent in a refill and three weeks later(2 days before I’m out of meds) I had to call to request a refill and lo and behold, you can’t. They said they never received a request for a refill. I said I would happily email the screenshot of the confirmation. They declined the offer. They send you some form to fill out and send back. After all that, I received a curt email from my doctor informing me that it is my responsibility to follow up and make sure they refilled the meds.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2bec77036b591:0xa26d467bf9dc9582</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

FRAUD!!! Happier Living double-bills their customers...login to your insurance website & check the details of your claims with Happier Living...they DOUBLE-BILL for one appointment using two service codes. For a 15-minute appointment on Zoom, I was billed for two separate services for $250 and another for $225 = $475 total for one 15-minute appointment on Zoom! HORRENDOUS!!! Avoid this place.<//text>

This place should be reported and investigated for fraud. After reading the multiple reviews on how they over charge people in need and give them the run-around and never provide the therapy needed, they should not be in business. People are coming to them in need of HELP some already at their breaking point ,and this place is taking advantage. I almost booked an appointment but was turned off by their questionnaire.  All of the people were victimized by their poor billing practices need to report them to the state agency and insurance company. These experiences are horrible especially for someone who is hurting and needs support. What is wrong with these people?!!</review>

I booked a virtual appointment for a general psych evaluation. I was hoping to get a second opinion on an ADHD diagnosis I had received from a different doctor. When booking the appointment I was very clear about what I was hoping to get out of the appointment, and that I was not interested in medication, I simply wanted an accurate opinion on a diagnosis. I also confirmed with the front desk before booking that I would only be responsible for a $30 co-pay. When I had my appointment, the doctor was not helpful. She said she read over my profile and wanted to start a medicinal treatment. I explained that I was not interested in medication at this point and only wanted her opinion of my ADHD diagnosis. She told me that she was unable to do that and prescribed medication anyways. Our appointment was only about 15 minutes. When I got the bill it was for $250. I called the office to explain that my co-pay should only be $30 and they let me know I would have to contact the financial department because they could not make that change. After a few weeks, they finally refunded me $220. After about a month, I randomly got another charge from Happier Living for $324.51. I called the office again to ask about this charge and they literally said, "I don't know what that charge is for." I had not had an appointment with them in over a month. She told me she would contact the finance department again and have them call me. At this point, Happier Living has wrongly charged me over $500 for a 15 minute appointment that I was not satisfied with. Do not book an appointment with them. You will be incredibly disappointed.< /review>

patient beware. this place charges in excess of $500 for missed appts, no matter if ur ill or not they charge. no discussions to be had no removal of fee when the why is shared - just the charge and that’s it. what a poor way to take care of its patients. the therapy sessions were mediocre at best. avoid the f outta this place. find a place that works with their patients and cares more about people than profit.<//Review>

Tried to get help for my son who is an adult and was looking for a course of action.  He signed all consent forms for me to be in the loop and I Signed their forms as financially responsible person.  Wanted to know the plan and no one will speak to you.  All they keep trying to do is schedule another appointment.
What is the plan?  Nobody knows.  Dr. did not return calls.  Girl answering phone doesnt know and says speak to the Dr.<//Text>

<date>1600297635386</date><resp>None</resp><text>If I could give 0 starts I would! This year was truly hard for me as I'm sure it was for everyone else and I suffered a mental break down. I started to do research to find a psychiatrist and Happier Living was highly rated. I called there office multiple times because I wanted to be sure on the price and also because I always have a lot of questions. I wanted to be sure they were right for me. I remember speaking with the receptionist and them calling my insurance to verify my price that I would need to pay out of pocket. They confirmed it would be $50 with my insurance. And boy was I excited because Psychiatric services are not cheap. You would think after calling 4 times and after 2 different receptions calling my insurance and saying the same thing 4 times that the price you were quoted is true.  I started sessions with Ashley Cyronak. She obviously is being over worked and has more than what she can handle on her plate. I am not saying this to bash the doctor this is simply my thoughts from observation and my experience. The sessions always felt rushed and I was always crying because I simply felt like I was not being fully understood. She always seemed aggravated and didnt really seem like she wanted sessions with me. I dont remember talking much. I remember being overwhelmed because my medication dosages were being increased so fast. Because of my mental breakdown I went on Short term disability and paperwork had to be filed. She complained that her bosses did not allow that but she would do it this one time. All in all it simply did not feel like a good experience. After the last dosage increase I simply i was so overwhelmed and decided to just continue sessions with my therapist (Whom by the way is amazing and works for a different company). This was on 06/03/3020. Randomly I decided to check my HSA account and claims and boy was I shocked to see my HSA account nearly depleted and that I was being charged 250 for sessions instead of the 50 they confirmed. I immediately contacted them to figure out what was going on. I asked them to review the calls. They said they would have someone contact, that never happened but I also didnt receive any further Bill's so I figured they corrected the situation. Now we are in Septemeber and I receive a huge red pass due notice. Again they tell me they will call back after research and surprisingly someone does. The lady Bylanda in billing says they confirmed that I was charged 50 for the first 2 initial sessions and then it went up. She said the ladies I spoke with were just giving estimates. Which didnt make sense because if that was the case i would have paid more for the first sessions. She said she could no longer review the calls because it was now passed 3 months and that the balance would remain. Even though i asked for this months ago.  I think it's pretty ironic that they literally waited until those calls expired to contact me. Now I'm forced to pay this company that seriously did nothing for me. Happier living? Yea right, you guys have made things so much worse for my life. I truly wish I'd never contacted you or used your services. It was truly my worst mistake. I hope someone finds this helpful. In rough times like these having a company be upfront with you about fees is important. I know what I can afford and would have never agreed to 250 for 20 minutes like never. Nothing I can do it about it now so whatever.< /text><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

<review>If you are not doing well, struggling, or need help... DO NOT COME HERE. Won’t type the long horror story but my girlfriend struggles with depression and has been seeking help. They will either  schedule you after they are closed or cancel and not bother to tell you. So in the 4 weeks you try and see a doctor, you will have lost money from taking time off work and driving over and paying for parking, over an over  and never seeing anyone for appointments THEY PICKED. But most importantly, you would have also lost time actually getting help from competent people. From one human being to another, stay away.
Everyone who has a horror story too, do your part and file a complaint with your insurance provider.<//review></record>

They helped me find a combination of meds that has worked.  I stopped drinking and self-medicating.  Working together we set goals for my personal happiness and I’m a much better friend, wife and mother.  I like myself a lot more and am truly enjoying life these days.  When I call or email the office I easily get assistance and love that I can meet with my therapist virtually.  And they take my insurance!!  Seems like the people complaining don’t know how to call their insurance company and understand their insurance benefits.  Just because they accept insurance doesn’t mean it’s free people!  Can’t say enough great things about the team here.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This group of doctors has shady financial practices. Beware! I changed insurance and they had my cc number so they charged full price for 2 sessions even though I only had one without checking with me to see if I had new insurance. Then to make it worse - they don’t work with my new insurance - Blue Cross/Blue Shield because BCBS won’t work with them anymore because of their unethical business practices. Stay away from this group of doctors</text>

<review>The Genen Group has everything you need under one roof, making the whole process efficient and manageable. Even better, Dr. Arena is a kind and fantastic listener. Highly recommend this group.

UPDATE: A month after this review (which I was asked to write for a discounted service) Genen Group stopped accepting my insurance. I understand business is business, however I was only given a weeks notice and all my future appointments were immediately cancelled. At the time I was dependent on these appointments alongside medication. I had pull their teeth for a 30 day supply of medication which should have been provided from the time they stopped accepting me. I still stand by Dr. Arena as a good provider, however I won't miss then Genen Group for the way they handled this fiasco.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Stay far far away from this place! Billing and scheduling is a literal nightmare, and my therapist missed multiple sessions (despite them being recurring weekly appts) because they just weren't on her calendar. I was overcharged for every single appt, but their billing dept couldn't figure out how to issue refunds. To top it off, after talking to other providers, some of the advice I was given here was also downright dangerous. For example when the NP told me "you are a person who meds don't work for" after I had a bad reaction to the first one. Do not bother trying to get help from any of these people.<//Text>< pics>

The Genen group has been a breath of fresh air for me. My therapist and psychiatrist work together to provide the best care for me. I have never felt uncomfortable speaking openly to any of the staff and I am thankful to them for being able to answer any questions or concerns. The desk staff is amazing and have helped me through any insurance questions or pharmacy issues that I've experienced.

I've given them 5 stars because in all honesty, I couldn't ask for more. They have gone above and beyond on more than one occasion.</review>

<review>After moving, I had to find a new Psychiatrist. It was difficult to say the least.  Basically I had to close my eyes and point to someone on a page.  How awful when you're choosing someone you hope to 'gel' with and who's going to know intimate details of your life?!

Well, Someone was looking down on me!

The first thing I felt when I walked in the waiting room was a wonderful sense of calmness!  It's clean and the staff pleasant and professional.

I was there to see Dr. Holly Schwartz. She was quite a surprise. Though she was very professional, she genuinely was interested in me and made me feel like I was the only person she knows that matters! (That's a first for me.) She is extremely intelligent and I know I am getting the best treatment for my needs!

I can't imagine anyone wanting to go anywhere else!< /review></record>

I was a patient for over a year. At a certain point all patients were required to sign an agreement stating that if they arrived more than four minutes late, they would miss the appointment and be charged for it. I was on SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance)  at the time due to extreme depression and anxiety and was not functioning at the highest level, making me a perfect mark. Eventually, I missed a 40 minute appointment with a psychiatrist and was charged $500 by the "Happier Living" folks. I refused to pay it and Genen subsequently sent the bill to collections, which has seriously damaged my credit rating. The business is sleazy and the last thing those who are running it care about is the welfare of the patients. I suggest to anyone considering becoming a client of theirs to avoid it like the plague.</text>

Dr. Gundersen is so smart and he changed my life. I love him. He takes so many notes and is a great listener. Even though he seems serious at first, he is a very sweet person. He is non-judgmental and his strategy to achieve a better quality of life works extremely well.
Also, Jose at the front desk is very friendly. Always works with my crazy schedule! The place also has great hours for busy people.<//Review>

I am very pleased to be working with The Genen Group. It is very helpful to have both my psychiatrist and psychologist in the same place. They are able to read each other's notes. I believe this provides me with better care. The office staff is very good.

I found the Genen Group after much research into decently reviewed mental health practitioners.  My experience has been generally pleasant, but the best interactions are with the incredible staff.  It is easy to get a hold of someone to make an appointment or answer your general questions.  The one negative thing is that unless you know which doctors can and cannot prescribe medications, you're going to have to be sure you know what you're getting before making an appointment with a particular doctor.  Some doctors are psychologists and some are psychiatrists.  Depending on your needs, make sure you pick the right doctor!<//Text>

<Review>I say STAY AWAY from this group.  They have a revolving group of practitioners (although they have all been great, they just don't stay) and the client support is AWFUL.  Get this -- they will not provide a bill to submit to insurance if there is an unpaid balance!  A balance that insurance will pay!

Unfortunately we found out too late that this practice is not in network for my daughter's primary insurance, but it is in network for her secondary insurance.   Initially the office submitted claims to her secondary insurance, but when they learned they were secondary they pulled back payments pending receipt of an EOB showing denial from the primary insurance, then they will reinstate payments at 100%.  So no problem, we will submit an Out of Network Claim.  But to do that we need a blill with a diagnosis code.  We finally got through to the office after several attempts and reached Jynnifer M. who informed us that they would not provide us with a bill because we now have a balance.  Do  you see the circular logic here?

After her telling me I just don't understand several times and I told her I do understand, but this is nonsensical, I need a bill to submit to get them paid,  I hung up very frustrated.  Worse part is that my daughter who is making good progress must find a new practice because she can't have any future appointments until the balance is cleared up.  But they won't give us a bill to submit.  OMG!  I repeat DO NOT GO HERE!</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My therapist at Genen Group is amazing. I've worked with approximately 5 different therapists over the past decade,  and this therapist is the only one I have connected with. Front desk staff is friendly and attentive. The office itself is bright, cheery, and well-designed. Parking is fairly easy for West Hollywood. I highly recommend the Genen Group.</Review>< gmap_id>

I have been coming to The Genen Group for almost a year and cannot say more wonderful things about their staff & facility.

The offices are very clean, modern, and in walking distance to my house. Not only did they match me perfectly with my dr. (Dr. McNamara) but they really took the time to listen to what I needed and wanted out of therapy. I've been to quite a few therapists in my time, and I can honestly say this group is the best I've encountered.

Jose at the front desk is always friendly and helpful. As I travel a lot they're always able to move my days around and work with my ever changing schedule. They also work well with insurance.

I feel at home here, like I'm taking to a friend and not being judged.

I highly recommend The Genen Group to anyone looking for a caring therapist.</review>

<Review>A complete joke! As I see from the other reviews, they do this to multiple people. They told me they accepted my insurance, and I would only need to pay a $40 co-pay. Then I was slammed with a $500 bill and Happier Living telling me that my insurance company was not paying for my claim, and that I needed to demand that Anthem cover the costs. Low and behold, Anthem did reject my claim but they're not holding me financially responsible. Happier Living is trying to force me to pay for their errors, but they never pick up the phone and won't return my voicemails. Avoid this place at all costs and don't pay them a dime!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My experience with the Genen Group has been very positive. The front desk staff are so friendly, and always make me feel right at home and comfortable. My doctor has been AMAZING, and I don't know what I would do without her. Highly highly recommend this place! Do it, now!</Review>

I highly recommend the Genen Group and Dr. Irving! They are well staffed and extremely efficient at what they do. Scheduling appointments is easy, and they even send text and email appointment reminders which I find very helpful. Dr. Irving is highly qualified and supportive.<//text>

Stay away. They do not listen. My daughter went in begging for help. Nothing was done and she was told to come back in six weeks. Her critical time is now not in six weeks. Don't waste your money which they are more than happy to take in large amounts.</Review>

It's not even worth arguing with the people who gave this establishment low 1 star reviews. This place is extremely convenient. The staff has always been helpful. And usually answer the phone pretty quick. My only tips are to show up at least 10 or 15 minutes early, and answer you phone or listen to the voice mail they always leave the day before your appointment.<//Text>

As a creative who’s struggled with depression and difficulty concentrating and focus most of my life, I am so appreciative of the doctors at the Genen Group.  My colleagues, my partner, pretty much everyone recognizes the changes I’ve made since I started working with this team.  They took the time to really listen, understand me, my story and work with me – I feel like myself, finally!  Their offices are beautiful.  The staff is lovely.  I like that I’m able to email the office and my providers.  And it’s obvious tht everyone who works there really enjoys being there.<//Review>< Pictures>

So let me get this straight, I showed up and had over 30 minutes left of reserved time and you claim I never came and need to pay $500 now. What a joke, find a new place that will take you seriously.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>The Genen Group has been truly remarkable across the board. Dr. Gundersen has been an incredible doctor for me. The Genen Group is very friendly and professional and very technology oriented which is helpful for appointment reminders and prescriptions. Office staff and doctors are all top notch.

<text>This group does not make the effort to listen to patient's needs and wishes. When I reached out to this group to inquire about seeing someone I made clear that the reason I needed a new therapist was because my current therapist was no longer going to be in network. I made clear who my insurance provider was and that I needed to see someone in network. I had called my insurance and been told that the group was in network so when I called the Genen Group I assumed they would comply with my request to give me someone in network. They did not, and only after 2 visits did they make clear that the individual that they had given me appointments with was one of the few members of their group who was not in network. They have shown little consideration for making this error and I have lost a lot of faith in them as a care provider.< /text><Name>Julia Nielsen< /Name></record></dataset><record>

So far the Genen group has been SUCH a huge help to me. I am so glad that I found them. I've been working with Dr. Schwartz which has been a great pleasure so far and she really helped me get back on track in a time where I felt like I was slipping and really did not see a way out.

Scheduling is easy and quick, the front desk staff are awesome and really helpful, and I highly recommend them if you're in distress. Make the call, you deserve the support!</Text>

Jose at the front desk is extremely helpful, as are the rest of the office staff!

When I made the appointment they were accepting my insurance.  I traveled 1 and a half hours each way for this appointment.  When I arrived they informed me that they no longer take my insurance.  They said they sent out emails but neither my husband nor I ever received the email.  They said we could keep the appointment but we would have to pay the full $500.00 out of pocket.
What a waste.  No communication.<//Review>

Such a shady, unethical company. I was a patient​ through Happier Living, ​HardLoop processes their payments and insurance claims. Everything with my insurance was verified and I started seeking therapy​.  I got a ​notice that they are no longer accepting my insurance and that I would need to see a new doctor.

I then get a ​notice that they are billing me $680 for services. I call Anthem, Anthem had denied one claim because they submitted some audacious bill about a fake disorder. Anthem asked for proof via medical records which couldn't be produced because I HAVE NO DISORDER. Then they said Anthem never responded to another claim, that's because the bill from HardLoop/Happier Living/GenenGrooup was never sent to Anthem. They can't pay something that they never received​. The Anthem rep gave me her name and extension and said that Anthem had been trying to reach someone there to handle all the grievances​ but there is NO WAY TO CONTACT Hardloop! Which I see as well. Everything is email/voicemail which is spotty in responses.

The sad thing is that many people are going here because of mental health issues. The stress mounted with normal life and these crazy bills is not healthy for this clientele​ base. Please stay far away!</review>

Things to take into consideration

-traffic on the 101 is hit or miss. An emergency could easily add an hour to a 10 mile commute.
-there is no parking, which easily adds 10-20 minutes to your commute when you have to walk 1/2 mile.
-there is a 250 dollar late fee for being 10 minutes late to an appointment.

Unfortunately, this place would rather lose a customer than waive or lower the fees for being late the first time.

its not a matter of if you will get charged, its a matter of when.

Advice:
- for the sake of your mental health, do not go here
- if you do go here, plan to arrive about 1.5 hrs early to each appointment to avoid the 250 dollar fee.< /review>

I'm enjoying the drs I've met with thus far but could use a little more help with making appointments and payment.

Update: I eventually have decided to stop going here because the scheduling, billing and front desk systems were such a pain. I was automatically billed incorrect (and large) amounts more than once, appointments were confirmed for the wrong date, no one calls back from the automated line while its impossible to reach someone in the office and front desk team was R.U.D.E. to me quite often.<//Review>

Be sure to check reviews of your medical practitioner independently from the practice!!!<//review>< pictures>

I moved from NY and needed to find a new psychiatrist to prescribe my medication for ADHD.  I didn’t initially like that they required me to come in monthly to get a prescription.  But I am so happy they did.  I worked with Dr. Genen to identify some annoying side effects that my prior doctors and I had ignored.  He spent more time with me than any of my prior doctors to listen to me and work with me and the med changes we made have been so helpful.  I also started therapy – something I had never tried before – and I highly recommend.  I’m a busy professional so I’m so appreciative that their appointments start and end on time – so rare to find.  I have to agree that a lot of people posting negative things online about this group seem wildly immature – I get you’re seeing a psychiatrist because you have issues – but a lot of these complaints seem really petty.<//Text>

<Text>I love the Genen Group. I've been coming here for nearly 2 years for therapy. The doctors are all professional and accommodating. The location and office is top notch. If you're looking for quality treatment whether it be therapy or psychiatry, Genen Group is the place to go. I couldn't speak more highly of this establishment, and of Dr. Haskall.< /Text><name>Van Kote<//name></record>

I've been going to the Genen Group for 3 years now. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. I've had two different professionals and both exceeded my expectations. I recommend this place to everyone I know who is seeking help to live a happier life---it has helped me immensely.<//text>

I was so nervous about finding proper healthcare once I moved across the country, but Genen was the first and only place I needed to check out before planting my roots. Genen has already tremendously helped me in the few months I have been here. The staff has been pleasant and helped me in every way that they can and I look forward to continuing my business here.</text>

<Text>There's sometimes miscommunication with the Billing department.  They insist on keeping your credit card on file, and my card was debited by mistake on three different occasions for over $200 on each transaction. And all they feel they need to do is apologize without any other accountability.   My doctor is great though.< /Text>< pics>

The Genen Group has communicative and helpful staff that make every appointment a pleasure. The vibe of the waiting room is extremely relaxing, and there's never an issue with waits or mismanaged scheduling. Highly recommend to anyone in the LA area.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I'm about to loose my mind with these people. I made an urgent appoint for the following day with them for my daughter as a new patient. I kept my daughter out of school the next day to take her in, and while I'm getting ready to go I receive an email from their office saying the appointment is no longer available??!!! What? I sent all the documentation required and the ""care coordinator"" was getting rather uppity and lying to me about what she'd said the day before. Clearly all the calls are recorded and guess what, she said that due to the delicate nature and urgency she'd note to keep my appointment .... blah blah blah.
Now I'm so upset and I still need help for my daughter now. I guess good this sort of disservice happened upfront so I won't have to deal with them during the process. Thank you Tori and for refusing to transfer me to manager. Thanks for saving me future headaches.</review>< pictures>

Dr. Naig was amazing and actually took the time to listen to me and work with me. I was definitely leery to meet with him as I was told he’s a new Doctor, but he’s definitely an amazing Doctor and I can’t recommend him enough. I feel like we came up with a tailor-made plan for me!<//Review>

I KNOW IT’S LONG, BUT PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE TREATED BY THE GENEN GROUP.

These “psychiatrist” are not here for your well-being. I’ve been with this group for 6 months and they only want to milk as much money out of you as they can. My very first appointment with them made me skeptical at the beginning. I was 10 minutes late to the appointment due to finding parking. 15 minute grace time is  nonexistent even though they tell you it is. I go upstairs to the front desk and they had already wanted to rescheduled my appointment, and told me I have to pay a $500 penalty fee. I refused,  they told me I didn’t have a choice. The more I argued a woman comes up to the front desk and told me “We will only charge $25 this time, but next time I will have to pay $500.” I was desperate for help and paid $25 for the 10 minute late fee. The fact they tried so hard to get me to pay $500 without a choice and then changed their mind... well, blows my mind.

My psychiatrist was Dr. Naig. This doctor never had any emotion whatsoever. He radiates a put-off vibe, no concern, no empathy, and a I’m already tried of seeing you today attitude. I just thought he was having a bad day, but that’s just who he is, which concerns me because he is talking with people who have mental issues. Months down the line I get an email from this group stating how Dr. Naig will no longer be taking patients and I will be appointed to another psychiatrist. I’m already his patient? So basically he just threw me behind his shoulder, gave up due to the lack of appointments he was receiving from me, which by the way he suggested to me that every 2 months would be appropriate to meet. Now I have to start over with another psychiatrist.

The day I was suppose to meet with my new  psychiatrist turned into a nightmare. I woke up very sick with bronchitis. I was in my bed dead to the world trying my hardest to get well because I have a new job I have to get back to as quickly as possible. I received an email from my new psychiatrist asking if I was okay, which I will give her credit because she personally reached out. I immediately emailed her back telling her the situation and that I would like to have a rescheduled appointment. She told me they might charge me for the missed appointment, and in seconds my bank account was -$495.00. I didn’t even get a chance to speak with anyone before this was changed to my account. For the next 48 hours I fought to get my money back, but they told me I needed proof of my sickness to be refunded. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Am I a child? No. Should have I went in with this sickness and cough all over the employees and my new psychiatrist? I don’t think so? I couldn’t even walk, let alone drive because my head felt like concrete and couldn’t keep my balance to save me life. I couldn’t even go to rite-aid to buy the inhaler the doctor  prescribed to me because they put a negative in my account.

Super frustrated and emotional, I walked into there offices personally handing them a doctors note and showed them I obviously wasn’t well for my appointment... enough proof? Nope. They insisted to hassle me for a relevant date that wasn’t printed on the paper. I asked them to call the doctor themselves, but they wouldn’t do it. My doctor told me later “Having a date on a excuse wasn’t necessary and it’s peraonally none of their business as long as they receive an authentic doctors note” and that she was willing to fax to them personally, but fax number they gave me did not work. I  finally got refunded after emailing a note with the date and threatening to sue them. Keep in mind this was much worst in person. They worthless feeling, emotion and anger they caused me was brutal nonetheless.

Go somewhere else, find someone that cares, find a doctor that will work with you to get better because the Genen Group is not here to promote “Happier Living”. They are here to take as much as they can get. Shame on you for treating your patients like this. You are a money driving machine that should be disqualified in helping the mentally ill.<//review>

I had a very positive experience. I felt Dr. Gundersen was professional and empathetic. He took the time to understand what I am dealing with and answered all my questions and addressed my concerns. This was not my first time seeing a psychiatrist but it was by far the most positive.
I have been going to Genen for a few months now. Working with Dr. Di and Dr. Gundersen has had a positive effect on my life.< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I've been a patient since almost day one and have seen them grow from a one-man operation into a large office.  As a person with a disability, keeping track of my healthcare can be a full time job, and they do a great job making things as easy as possible for me.  Of the offices I visit, they are by far the most well-oiled machine.  Further, of all the LA mental health providers I've worked with, their office has been the best by far.

Pros:
- They're a one-stop-shop for your mental health needs.
- They take most insurance, which is rare for psychiatric care providers.
- They have a wide variety of professionals to fit the many needs of their patients.  Also, if you don't initially find the right match, you can switch to someone else in the office.
- They're always on-time.  Your appointment will start precisely on time every visit.  This is unlike any medical provider that I've ever had.
- Online patient data access with appointment reminders & everything else you could want.  Their online interaction is also VERY predictable, which can be a challenge for other offices.
- While not perfect, their billing department is probably the most straightforward of all my providers.  If things are off, they'll actually follow through to figure things out.
- The front desk staff is very helpful and friendly.
- Their location is within 'rolling' distance of my home.
- They are 100% wheelchair accessible.  There is an elevator in the building which has never been out of order.  Almost every hallway and doorway is wide enough to get around with ease.  Only one of their offices has two 29in doors and an uncomfortably narrow hallway, although it is still easily navigable for me.  Not all of their doorknobs are compliant, but there is a lobby on each floor so you can have your provider meet you there.  Their restrooms (which require a key and are common to the building) aren't fully compliant, but they're workable:  The entry door lacks ADA knobs, is just over 29in wide, and is a bit tough to open; but I've never required the assistance which they consistently offer.  Also, the stalls aren't full size, but have proper bars, etc.
Cons:
- Due to the number of professionals in their office, they have a somewhat larger turnover than most.  I've been assigned 4 different psychiatrists over the years, but the other member of my household has had the same one the entire time.  Of the 4, all but one was excellent, and the "less excellent" one didn't last very long.  On the psychology side, I've had two different therapists over the years during two different 'cycles' of therapy.  Both have been excellent.
- The various doctors can vary in quality.  But again, if one isn't a match, you still have other options.
- The fact that they're always on time means that YOU MUST ARRIVE ON TIME.  If you're at all late, you miss out on that part of your appointment.  This can be a difficult proposition in LA and even more so for someone with a disability like myself.  But, they will still let you see your doctor for an abbreviated session which means that you won't have to make due without your meds and assurance that your mental state hasn't deteriorated to critical levels.
- While some staff offer appointments into the evening, their office staff leaves at 5, and their phones stop ringing at 4.  For later appointments, they check you in 'automatically' which pretty much eliminates the problem.  These contact times are also in line with all of my medical providers.   The added convenience of later appointment options is really a plus, but keep in mind that you won't have anyone to deal with issues and check you in during these times.</review>< Pictures>

This is my first negative review: I left my jacket at the office, called the same day, and a man said that they would store it until my next appointment. I called again to pick it up and the same man remembered me and said that he would call me back. There was no call back. Then I called again the week after and Samantha, the office manager, told me "we no longer have it." She did not even offer to compensate me and told me that I was an inactive patient. I will not come back here anymore. Sad to say but I was robbed at this office.<//review>

<review>Nothing really positive whatsoever to say.

Cash mill- not real psych's. Recently had a problem, they had no advice and said I should find another doctor. No referral, nothing.

Rescheduled my appt several times. Charged me when I wanted to reschedule.

I'd look elsewhere.<//review><time>1507669280358<//time><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x80c2bec77036b591:0xa26d467bf9dc9582< /GmapID><rate>1< /rate><UserId.>110911003423007952419<//UserId.></record>

Dr. Taber is great, it took a while to find someone who I could work with in the group to feel comfortable finding my dosage on meds. My original psychatrist entered information incorrectly which lead to an unnecessary restriction. I'm happy to have established care with him - only down side is getting over here is a nightmare.</text>

This is a comment, not about the doctors, but about the office practices. I still go to the Genen Group; however, I do have to agree with some of the reviews claiming that 1) no one answers the phone;  2) their preoccupation with money and fees; especially cancellation fees;  3) front office staff can be a bit "prickly" at times, especially as pertains to $$$$., 4) frequent (and in my opinion) unnecessary office visits. There also exists a double standard in regards to appointment cancellations. If a patient cancels without 24-hours notice, they are expected to pay a very hefty cancellation fee ($125 - keep in mind most doctors charge about $25). Yet, on several occasions I have been called at the last minute to reschedule or change appointment times because of issues on their end, yet I as a patient have no recourse.

My other pet peeve is that if you do cancel prior to 24 hours the only way you can avoid paying the fee is by submitting a doctor's note. When first told this, my reaction was "am I in grammar school?" They want a note from the doctor?  It felt condescending as I am an adult (a senior in fact) and felt I was being treated like a child. It would seem from their vantage point that the only type of reason accepted for a last-minute cancellation is patient illness, when in reality there are all sorts of reasons to cancel/reschedule an appointment.

I've been seeing psychiatrists for a long time (for medication checks only) and before going to the Genen Group it was never required of me to return on a monthly basis.  Most other psychiatrists expect a med-check every 6 months or so.  I questioned the doctor about this and commented that I wouldn't agree to monthly visits - similar to another review here, I've been on the same medication for years and don't need a monthly check-up. I was told that it is their policy, period. I am a bit stunned at their lack of flexibility as each patient is different and having a blanket policy just doesn't seem appropriate.

It would seem (since all of my "complaints" center around the theme of money) that what counts most is the bottom (profit) line. I know I can choose at any time not to go there and I hold that thought in the back of my mind; however the doctor I see is good and my well-being is more important to me than focusing on what might be considered sketchy office practices. It is a business after all.</text>

<review>Cold and zero compassion from this group.  Charged me a $100 cancellation fee when i mixed appt times.  Office claimed they emailed a reminder and I did not get that email.  Begged them to let me come in a half hour late because I could not  afford the late fee.  They charged me anyway even though I was crying on the phone ,they could have cared less.  I called my Cedars doctor who made the referral to report my treatment.  STAY AWAY. COLD COLD COLD.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><name>Linda Muggli< /name>< Response>

My experience at the Genen Group has been 5 stars all around! I established care with Dr. Genen at the beginning of 2015 and saw Dr. Malakuti for therapy...both were fantastic! I re established care last month with Dr. Klyman and the experience has been just as fantastic!< /review>

Dr. Schwartz  has done more for me than many years of therapy couldn't. I met the team at a time in my life where things couldn't have been worse - my Mother battling terminal Cancer and my best friend and business partner passing away at 31 years old. I could not have gone through it without them. The staff and care are A+.< /Review>

I rarely if ever write reviews, but this group is outrageous. NOTHING "HAPPIER LIVING" about this group at all. One star is only because the MD and psychotherapist I had were actually good. Sure, office cancelled few of my appointments, sometimes pretty abruptly, sometimes causing me to go without meds for few weeks. But I didn't think too much of it as stuff happens. Last month one of the claims was denied and I called my insurance and Genen group right away to resolve it. Insurance needed med records due to Genen group apparently billing for a higher level of care (which sounds fishy), Genen group stated they sent all requested paperwork. No word from Genen Group after. Then on 11/13/17 I get an email stating they no longer take my insurance and all my appointments are cancelled starting 11/15/17. Would any responsible caring medical professional ever drop patients giving them 2 day notice? THAT is unprofessional at best. So I was already obviously upset because A) I had to find a new doctor and therapist, B) I had NO medications left, because their "standards" say that YOU HAVE TO come every 30 days for refills because obviously they want to bill more. The excuse that they provide to all patients here, that 30 day visits are needed because it's psychotropic meds or whatever it is they claim. I have been to other doctors, taken other medications, and NO ONE EVER thought every 30 days visit was required. I understand that with certain conditions, there is a need for frequent monitoring, dose adjustments, and so on. But not for the same medication, same dose, stable controlled condition. This practice puts patients in danger and is not done for safety. What if I got ill and missed my appointment? Then I should go without my meds until I see the MD? HALF OF PSYCH MEDS STATE: DO NOT STOP ABRUPTLY. Yet, Genen Group creates their own standard, where it is ok to stop anything whenever Genen group doesn't get reimbursed or has scheduling issue. With psych meds, I highly doubt it is the standard of practice to allow patients to skip weeks worth of medication because the provider cancels your appointments. In the best case scenario they could have at least provided a courtesy refill while I find a new MD. Now, last night, of course at the end of the day when you are unable to reach their office or your insurance, I get the email that Genen group is charging me 380$ in 4 days because I signed the agreement that if insurance doesn't pay, I am due for the full price of session. FINE, but isn't it at least human decency to provide more than 4 days heads up. Not everyone just has a spare 400$ sitting around. They could have notified me weeks ago when the claim was still denied. Yet, they never notified me of it. They waited long enough so they could charge the whole price. And from reviews below, I see that I am not the only one and sounds a lot like FRAUD. No self respecting company would do such a thing to people who are already under care due to medical issues. Never again would I recommend this horrible company to anyone else in my life, I will tell my MD to stop referring patients there because it is not how a human being should be treated. I just emailed them to let them know they HAVE to submit paperwork to my insurance. It is not even a matter of the money or payment, but how this company treats their patients. As a medical professional myself, I simply do not see how any self respecting and caring person can do this. I honestly hope that this group gets exposed for what they are doing. UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND PAYING HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR QUICK VISITS EVERY SINGLE MONTH AND HAVING YOUR APPOINTMENTS CANCELLED WITH BARELY ANY NOTICE SOMETIMES, AND GETTING CHARGED MADE UP RATES FOR BEING LATE, MISSING YOUR APPOINTMENT, THEN THIS IS THE GROUP FOR YOU. OTHERWISE, BE AWARE THAT THEY WILL INCORRECTLY BILL YOUR INSURANCE, LEAVE YOU WITHOUT MEDICATION OR DOCTOR, AND SEND YOU A NICE BILL AS A PARTING GIFT.<//Text>

Should not be in practice, especially for the population of patients they are trying to treat. I would say this is not somewhere to go if you have mental health problems, as they may become exacerbated due to experiences at this clinic.<//Review>

Not only do they call to remind you about your upcoming apt, they also email you. The working website is a quick easy way to contact them with questions, and they even give you the dr's email. Best part is how attentive they are. They dont leave you sitting there waiting for a call if you need a refill or have any problems.... The office is beautiful, and the front waiting area always smells so good! I have seen 3 different dr.s over the years here- they were all fantastic, and Dr. Kylman is my current one and she is just the best. She has a great sense of humor and her demeanor is authentic- she really cares and she empathizes with you. Finding a place like this is a Godsend.</review>< UserId.>

DO NOT GO HERE! They are not in the business of helping, they are trying to suck as much money as they can out of you. I saw a new doctor, who I was told 'left' a week later. I needed help getting a prescription filled, for a non controlled substance, through my insurance mail order as opposed to the local pharmacy which cost 300% more. I was told I would have to come back in for them to help me. They seemed unsympathetic and smug.</review>

<Review>40 minute appointments are really only 20 min appointments or long enough time for them to give u ur drugs and u to leave. Forget about actually discussing anything. Dr Schwartz is a good doctor and I regret changing to dr taber. I specifically booked a 40 minute session since my co pay is 45$ either way (20 min or 40 min) and he was ACTUALLY setting me up to leave his office after less than 20 minutes!!! Instead of engaging me at all he just wanted to get me drugs and get me out. Dr Schwartz doesn't do this but overall I've become very disappointed with the genen group as they continue to grow. At first they were wonderful and very attentive, now you're lucky if ur dr responds within a week let alone at all! They have about 50 people on staff yet and they will get back to you and the customer service is good just my experience w the doctors over the past six months has been awful. I wrote a positive review to get a discounted co pay but the truth is whenever I walk in there now it makes me mad, I feel like I'm being violated. Dr Schwartz was definitely helpful as was dr rankin but dr taber is solely there to get paid and get u out. Today when I tried to use my entire session he suggested that we just bill me for 20 min rather than the 40, what about actually providing me the service that I'm there for?!

The Genen groups intentions are to consolidate ur "therapy" needs but as they grow i have found it more and more frustrating. They are always pushing u off on to someone else, today dr taber basically only engaged with me about drugs and people I could email to get further answers. I will not be seeing dr taber again. I used to leave my sessions with dr Schwartz feeling much better I left dr taber, today, feeling like I was a bother to him and like I was being pushed out. I specifically waited for the 40 minute appointment to discuss some things but was pushed out after 20 minutes, during which I didn't feel comfortable to even broach any of my issues. I'm glad he's making 400$ an hour to do this to people. As a doctor who is prescribing drugs I would think it's important to allow your patients to discuss what's going on in their lives with you since they are in therapy, i will be switching back to dr Schwartz and I will be writing a formal letter about dr taber.

<Review>I love the Genin Group! I rarely go in-network for my Therepy or Shrunk seasons but did some research and Genin is great! It's been a rocky few weeks and the front desk and Doctor Gundersen have been the most amazing compassionate mental health care providers that I have seen yet!<//Review>< Rating>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Very sketchy place! Just went to see reviews on Yelp and I got a Consumer Alert that read "We caught someone red-handed trying to pay someone to write, change, prevent or remove a review for this business. We weren't fooled, but wanted you to know because these actions not only hurt consumers, but also honest businesses who play by the rules. Check out the evidence here." Will be posting my review below on Yelp along with screen shots of this alert and the evidence. SKETCHY PLACE! I will be reporting them to authorities. Funny how all the 5 star reviews here on Google are vague, no mention of a staff person or a specific situation that was so fantastic to merit 5 stars. Looks like there's more social media monitoring being done here than actual patient care. Why don't you focus on helping patients rather than bolstering fake reviews for your crappy practice. Do your job! Dr Gundersen is weird and very unethical. I've never met the front desk staff in person as my appointments have always been after they close, but they are very rude over the phone and the care coordinator, Jonathan is an a--hole. He's also very stupid and lacks basic reading comprehension skills. This week he sent me an email to confirm an upcoming medication refill appointment for March (it's October, and I need monthly refills). I contacted them to inquire about refills for 2 medications, one of which I’ve been taking for almost 10 years. When I request refills, the doctor has his care coordinator schedule me for an office visit each time. I went along with the office visits for the first few months assuming this was standard and he just wanted to make sure the medication was ok. I’ve now been on the same dosage of this medication for the last 3-4 months. I asked if office visits were necessary for refills at this point since the dosage is established and his coordinator responded with a cut and paste message saying the doctor will need to see me before my next refill. When I asked specifically if this was going to be necessary for ALL refills going forward, he responded that I can either schedule a visit or pay $50 for a refill without a visit. After countless emails for clarification, he then responded that there must have been a miscommunication and that the Dr sent my refill to the pharmacy, but I will need to schedule an appointment for my next refill. I asked again, if monthly office visits are necessary if nothing is changing with the medication. The coordinator emailed me to confirm my next refill appointment in March (it's October, and the Dr only provides 30 day refills). Later that day, Dr Gundersen emailed me to say its Genen Groups policy to see patients before EVERY refill as the medication I'm prescribed is a controlled substance. I looked up the requirements for controlled substances on the DEA website, and it said providers can provide up to 90 days’ worth of medication and that the way dispense medication is at their individual discretion as long as they follow certain basic guidelines. Ok, cool! So at the doctors discretion, you would think that they would use common sense and say "this is a patient who's been on this medication before and is currently only taking half the dose from what she's taken in the past, so nothing to worry about here". No, these stupid, greedy a--holes state that its office policy to schedule visits for each 30 day refill. BUT THEY WILL BEND THE RULES AS LONG AS YOU PAY $50. Sounds like they care more about the office visit fee than about the patient or their medication. So Genen Groups policy is to waste your time, charge you for pointless visits where your doctor couldn’t care less about what you’re talking about and the care coordinators are illiterate jerks. GREEDY A--HOLES! The therapist I saw there was very nice, but I will not return to this office. They do not care about patients. They care about charging fees and having as little contact with the patients as possible.</text>< pictures>

This place has a terrible front office.  I attempted to book through an assistant who was given the run-around.  Then I called in twice personally to straighten things out and didn't get a timely response.  Their internal system allowed booking with a doctor who no longer accepts patients, and no appointment cancellations were sent out.  Terrible experience.<//review>

They are very "business centric". Strict policies meant to cushion their bottom line as a business, but made to sound like they are there for the benefit of the patient. Dropped my insurance shortly after I started seeing  a provider.</text>

Look no further. I moved back from NorCal and ended up backing into my roommates car with the moving truck nearly puncturing the passenger side door panel. These guys did everything they promised and at a price unmatched by the competition. I honestly didn’t believe them when they said they could fix it without having to replace the whole panel and then to do it in 2-3 days... for roughly a grand. I’m serious when I say I thought it was too good to be true. These guys are to be trusted and believed, I’m very thankful for their expertise and honesty. I’ve never felt compelled to leave a review but they earned my continued support and I’m sure they will yours too.< /Text>

These fellas are really friendly and extremely helpful. I had an issue with my car that I couldn't figure out.  They were able to diagnose the issue and it took only a few minutes to fix so they didn't charge me. Incredible! Next time I have an issue I'm definitely coming back here.< /Review>

Very impressed with my experience here. Adrian is a promise keeper. Did everything we spoke of, plus a couple other items that normally I would expect as extra were done without conversation.

Nice loaner car, no hassle, done a day early.....Dont hesitate to use this shop.

Thank you for the great service!!!!</Review>

Adrian was fantastic. This shop came recommended from my mechanic & they were great. I had a simple insurance claim for a can of spray paint that exploded all over my truck.  Adrian & Yasmin dealt with State Farm for me & worked to get the job done fast!<//review>

After crushing in the rear of my Audi, I never thought it would look or drive the same way again. Thankfully,  I was wrong. The car looks pristine and drives perfectly. I was updated regularly and spoke with several employees at different times. Every person was both kind and extremely knowledgeable.
5 stars was easily earned.< /Review>< pics>

Although I had to visit Elite Auto Collision due to someone hitting my vehicle, I really appreciated the service they provided. Their staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They took care of me right away and fixed my car fairly quickly. They took the time to explain everything and made sure they kept me in the loop with anything pertaining to my car and the insurance company. I would highly recommend their services. They are honest, friendly and time efficient.<//Review>

This is the  third time I have used Elite Auto Collision Repair Center for my repairs. They were referred to me by a fellow Realtor and I'm happy to say they have met all my expectations. The workmanship was excellent and so was the communication. It's a good feeling to leave your auto knowing in advance that the job will be done correctly. WELL DONE Elite.</Review>

So far so good.  I haven't got my car back yet, but they have sent me pictures every step of the way.  I live about 70 miles away and after some serious research, I chose Elite because they were the most knowledgeable and have had nothing but excellent  reviews.  My Corvette deserves only the best and until proven otherwise, Elite fits that description.< /Review>

<text>Adrian was the employee that helped me, he is extremely helpful, knowledgeable and easy to trust, I greatly appreciate that, I was offered a nice loaner car while my car was being worked on, and they provide a website with pictures for updates on my car was helpful to let me know the progress of being repaired. The transaction was super smooth and easy. Their work is well above par. Thank you Elite Auto Collision.</text>< name>

<text>Zero stars.

They repaired my car, but did not do a very good job. There were dozens of paint chips and scratches on both sides of my car, when they only repaired the front and back. They promised me the car on Tuesday, and then said they didn't finish in time, so they said Friday. They didn't finish the car on Friday so they said Tuesday. They didn't finish the car on Tuesday, so they said Wednesday. You get the idea. Don't go here, look elsewhere.<//text>< Response>

First of all, AMAZING super knowledgeable and helpful staff walk through the whole process and are available for your every need... from the rental to providing pictures online and emailing them to you. I received an update almost everyday. Impeccable customer service and super thorough service to your car. They are so on top of it and they work everything out with your insurance company. This was such a smooth process. Inhofe to never get into an accident again but if I ever need any collision/body work done, THIS is the place to go. I'd give it 10 soars if possible. Thank you Elite for everything!< /review>

I pick up my vehicle on Thursday, but I would have to say how pleased I am so far.  They were quick to get my SUV in and getting photos throughout the repair process has been great!  Nice to see my SUV and what they're doing and when they're doing it.  Cost of repairs seemed fair and adding a complete detail inside and out prior to picking up my SUV is a nice benefit!  I would say to give these folks a try!  I even got my "rental" vehicle covered by Esurance through Elite as well!  A newer Honda Civic in great condition and nice to not have to deal with a rental agency for it.< /Review>

This has got to be the best decision ever made.  The staff was very professional and friendly.  However the repairs done from before to after has been nothing short of outstanding.  I would definitely recommend this facility to any one who asks.  Professional and friendly staff, outstanding quality of work, timely delivery.  This is the true definition of A+.< /Review>< pics>

My wife was side swiped in a parking lot at the grocery store. We were recommended to Elite through Esurance, as they are one of the "star" repair shops. They fixed the car within a reasonable amount of time, as they did have to wait for some parts, but once the parts arrived, it was actually very quick. They had great customer service and were even fairly pro-active in getting us to pick up our car. Our work schedule around the holiday was a bit tough to work with. One note, they are not open on Saturday, even though the website and the sign on the front door say so. I still had a pleasant experience and the work was done in a timely manner and was still of high quality.< /Review>

Amazing service and the friendliest staff in town! Enterprise was unable to pick me up from Elite after I dropped my car off so an Elite Auto staff member drove me to Enterprise, thats customer service at its best! And I love that I was able to see photo updates on the process of my car during the 14 days of repair. Thank you!<//review>

<review>I was at first apprehensive of going to a repair center unfamiliar to me, but I am happy to say it was the right decision.  The work on my car was perfection, and I was surprised that they even detailed my car as a bonus.  The staff is very polite, and the work was done quickly.  Perfection!

<Name>Berenice Cruz<//Name><Review>My car got hit while being parked. Being only 19 I was very unhappy to have to deal with the insurance and having to do something with my car and doing everything on my own but the staff at Elite were amazing and helpful. Elite was recommended by the company Esurance but this is a great car repair shop! Don't have any doubt in calling them if you need an estimate or car repair. The two ladies that attended me while my visits were very welcoming and generous even gave me a ride home when some issue happened with Enterprise and the rental car I was suppose to take out. Since that problem occurred they said that they would try to finish my car as soon as possible so I wouldn't be car less. The repair only took two days and I was kept up to date through out the process. Great service and they are definitely the first auto shop to consider if I decide to make some other repairs that my car needs. Thank you for your amazing hospitality!<//Review>< date>

<Text>If you have to get bodywork done, this place is great. They were recommended by my insurance because they give free loaners while your car is being worked on - mine was in the shop for over two weeks, so I really needed that!
I'm definitely a fan of the fact that they post pics of your car as it goes through the repair process, and you can connect that to your Facebook so it just pops up with your newsfeed every afternoon.
Overall they did a good job, and while I hope I don't have to come back (because really, no one wants their car smashed up) if I do need to, this is where I'll go!<//Text></record>

It is unfortunate when you are involved in an accident. I was involved in two accidents within one month, both of which were not my fault. it is so stressful to try to work with two different insurance companies and get the car repaired. During the whole process Elite Auto Collision has been helpful, providing pictures of the progress of the work and answering any questions that I had.

My process was difficult specifically because I had two different claims at the same time.  One of the insurance companies was not as cooperative as I would have liked and Elite stepped in and helped me with the adjuster to get the claim resolved quickly. Their dedication to customer service goes above and beyond.

I hope I do not need them to do any repairs in the future however if I need any auto body work done, I will definitely use them and recommend them to my friends and family.< /Review>

I guess that is a lot for one customer at one body shop in less than three years.  I race a Corvette in a sports car series and occassionally their is body damage.  Elite is where I have been taking the car.  No matter how smashed up the car is, they always manage to get her all straightened out, the body panels aligned and give me a great looking car.  The most important part is the fast turn-around since I usually don't have more than about two weeks between races.

The flexibility and personal care aspect is what is tops though.  Two weeks ago I brought the car in straight from Auto Club Speedway in Fontana and told Adrian I need a fast turn-around in order to make a double race weekend on Labor day and Adrian has delivered.

Thanks Adrian!< /Review>< pics>

This place was awesome, my car was in a terrible condition and i didnt think it would ever be the same. Not only did they repair it back to new condition ,but they updated me on the current condition and provided me with a rental car while it was being repaired. They did an absolutely superb job on my car and at a low price as well. The staff there was great and im glad i got to meet them. Thank you Elite, you definitely took care of me and i will recommend your shop to anyone.

I Love You.

Free Loaner Car and hassle free conceirge services..  This is a local Southern California family owned and operated establishment that takes the hassles out of collision repair.  Once your information is delivered to Elite you can rest assured that they take care of the rest.  Negotiations, insurance policy issues and ensuring your vehicle is repaired correctly with Quality parts!  Stop by and visit for yourself.  I garuantee you will be met with hospitality and professionalism.  Personally, I'm a bit of a tech geek and I love my cars so I really appreciate the online video monitoring capabilites. This allows you to check in and see how "your baby" is doing.  It's that kind of transparency and honesty that lets you know exactly who you're relying on. I never take the time for reviews and I know some people love to bash business over the slightest hiccup.  I appreciate the business this family is running and want you to go in and check it out for yourself.</Review>

I've dealt with many auto collision repair shops over my 40+ years driving and must say that Elite is at the top of their game.  They first stated that my car would be a week to repair but on the 3rd day I received call ? when I wanted to pick up my car.  Due the fact that my car was not only completed but cleaned and ready for pickup.

Thank You Elite!!!!!!< /text>

<Text>Very unprofessional.  Took 25 days for repairs when they told us 14. They never even called to tell us it wasn't going to be ready the second time they delayed it I had to call them. Would never go back. But the car was fixed and clean so I at least gave them stars for that.</Text><gmapID>0x80d957188a5d1dcb:0xe21be75399cced18</gmapID>< Pics>

Nir. Was awesome. Someone tried to steal my vehicle and did damage to the ignition. He said he was on another job and that he would be there in an hour. He arrived almost to the minute installed a new ignition, and made a spare key and a new fob for a great price. Highly recommended.

I would give 6 stars if I could! I needed my key fob reprogrammed after my push-to-start car battery drained and lost connection to my key. I was super nervous when my car wouldn't start, but Nir explained that the key just lost connection to my car. He got the car going and reprogrammed my fob in about 20 minutes. Nir also talked me through what to do next to ensure my car battery's health (go to O'Reilly's and get it tested and possibly replaced).... and he even waited outside by my car and kept it running, so I could run inside and get my toddler ready to go straight to O'Reillys! Super sweet, super informative, super helpful!</Text>

He gave me a great price and because of his suggestion on how to solve the problem with my car he saved me alot of money I may of had to spend otherwise. He is a nice honest person and I recommend him and All American Lock and key.<//Text>< pics>

Wanted to make sure people who used Google could benefit from my positive customer experience.

We have used the same lock smith company for 10 years. My car was broken into and my office keys were stolen. I needed to have all the locks changed for the business.
I called our usual lock smith and was told I would have to wait until 6pm to get my locks fix. On top of that I was told that I would have to pay a $50 surcharge because it was after hours.
All American lock and key pick up the phone after two rings. I describe the issues and Nir was at my place of business within a hours. He was very detailed on getting the work done right the first time. He made sure all of the items I needed done where done EXACTLY how I needed.
Our Business now has a new company to take care of our future lock smith needs.

Thanks Nir for your professionalism, fast and quality work.<//review></record>

Gave me valuable advice on key-fobs and cutting. Hats off to him and his crew.Very satisfied... Funny follow-up. I called another company before going with All American. They had the nerve to contact me back to find out if I was still needing lock service, told them I was good. They wanted to know who did the work 4 me. Told them " ALL American".. They hung up in my face!. Now, if that doesn't tell you who to call 4 quality top notch  quality service, I don't know what else to say !!!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Nir is much more than a professional and highly responsive locksmith. He fixed a key stuck in my car's ignition and demonstrated awesome problem solving skills in the process.  He diagnosed the issue by taking a step-by-step approach to test each potential fault with the car's electrical ignition system. Highly recommended< /Text>< user_name>

Nir from All American Lock and Key is awesome and such a pro. He was willing to deal with the fact that the car I needed unlocked was on a military base and did the job in a matter of seconds. Highly recommend these guys to anyone!<//text>

He was super easy to deal with, very reasonable in price and more importantly extremely accommodating.   He also really knows what he is doing and was able to deal with a difficult un-drillable lock without any trouble.  I had an issue which required him to come out on a Saturday, which he gladly did.  He really takes pride in his work and this is his business and it shows.  Highly recommend.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

I locked myself out of my apartment early this morning. Thankfully, I had my phone and called All American Lock and Key. A locksmith was here within 30 minutes, and the gentleman was thoughtful, diligent, and got me back into my apartment after employing a few techniques to pick my lock. I’m so grateful, and felt my money was going to a good person and business.</Text>

#1 as far as I'm concerned. Great customer service, prompt response time, affordable prices and excellent work! The ignition was broke in my BMW and most places didn't even want to touch it or didn't have the expertise. Not only did he repair it, but her also did it in less than and hour. Not to mention he beat the prices (of the few who could do it) by half! I'll never call another locksmith.< /text>

<user_id>114102683940738428870<//user_id><rating>5< /rating><pics>None< /pics><review>So...this is the second time I've used the service of All American Lock and Key. And I have nothing but good to say!!!
Backstory: Back in August 2019 I thought I had lost the skeleton key to the 1890's J.Cartwright and Sons vintage safe given to me by my now deceased uncle. Every shop I called couldn't open it without destroying it, so when I found this service initially I was ELATED. He came thru, and in less than 20 minutes had it opened WITHOUT DAMAGE...and for a price that was UNMATCHED by any locksmith that quoted me. Luckily, I ended up finding the key two weeks later... Unfortunately, only to loose it via theft in April 2020.
That brings me to today 04/17/2020: after calling MULTIPLE LOCKSMITHS  this week due to the fact that I couldn't remember who opened it back in 2019 (after finding the key I didn't think to save the contact info for the locksmith) ... I got prices that ranged from an ASTOUNDING $1200 down to $500, and NONE of those prices reflected service that would not damage my safe. After calling over 10 locksmiths I again called All American not knowing he was the same individual that helped me the first time, and he actually REMEMBERED me!! He came over my home in less than 30 minutes and in like manner had the safe open in less than 15 minutes. Not only was he SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER than ALL BIDs but he wouldnt even take the extra money I attempted to give him for helping me out again. If your in the market for a PROFESSIONAL, TIMELY, HONEST Locksmith who can service all your needs....LOOK NO FURTHER! Thank you for your help sir... God bless you!!!!</review>< Name>

excellent service from an acceptionally friendly person. did not pull a bait and switch. told him the situation, quoted me a price, CAME TO MY HOME and took care of the situation. other company's quotes were either outrageous or did not want to deal with my kryptonite lock. highly recommend this one man show for your needs.< /text>

I have never needed a locksmith before but I am so grateful that I contacted All American Lock and Key. The dispatcher was friendly and helpful. The technician had a great attitude and disposition. He got the job done quickly. Though I hope to not be locked out again, I would call them in a heartbeat. I appreciate there are still businesses out there that value great customer service.

<Text>Great customer service, the tech was fast and reliable. Arrived in a timely manner and fixed my locks.
When the locksmith tech came in he identified  the problem and explained me why the lock hasn't been working properly. He had the lock parts in his mobile shop and perform the lock repair right there and then in just 1 visit. If I ever get locked out of my house or need a locksmith again I know who to call.
Thank you for a great locksmith service.< /Text>< Date>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Awesome service! We scheduled an appointment to change the locks at our house. Mike the technician was there right on time and worked really fast to change all locks and give us a good deal. One of the doors was really old and had tilted a little over time, so the lock did not line up perfectly. Mike went above and beyond and used his tools to slightly widen the opening so that the locks would close easily. Thanks again Mike!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1511642231288, 'text': 'Can’t thank you enough for taking the time to write a review here and on Yelp.

Google recommended this place to me when I searched for a locksmith since I sadly locked myself out of my car.  The owner is so honest and quoted me a fair price for the service.  I HIGHLY recommend them as they are very professional and made me completely satisfied!!! Thank you, All American Lock and Key!<//review>

<Review>I called this locksmith service after my house was broken into in Oakland. I had to change the keys in all locks around the house. The service was great, fast and super efficient. The technician was very kind and patient to all of my questions. I would recommend everyone who needs locksmith services to call this company based in Oakland, their service is beyond exceptional.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Absolutely amazing and fast service! I locked my keys my car with it still running. Not my brightest or proudest moment. I thought it was no big deal since my insurance covers roadside assistance but I was wrong. They are so slow and dont seem to care how long you are stuck. After waiting for more than an hour and begging my insurance to hurry up, I decided to call these amazing people. They came quickly and easily and saved me from waiting any longer for my insurance to get there. thanks so much!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>My best friend was borrowing my car and lost my only key, I called around multiple companies and couldn't find a locksmith in Orinda to replace my lost key.
I know Audi isn't as common as Honda but I didn't expect it to be this hard to find a replacement.
From taking my call to completing the job (fully working key in hand, hooray)
The service was absolutely great. I had a great experience with All American Lock & Key<//review></record>

<Time>1531904300580</Time><Rate>5</Rate><Review>So I'm from San Jose and today I went to the Alameda Beach with my niece and friend but there was an incident where my key got broken in half because it got stuck in the door so I was calling a lot of locksmith today but the price was really high and none of them showed. they said that the technicians had too many calls before me and they will not be available until the next day so I Googled locksmith near me and I came across the All American Lock & Key and I called him so they were very polite they gave me a very cheap reasonable price and they were very efficient they were actually very fast and they told me they would be there in about 20 minutes which I kind of did not believe because I've been waiting all day for the other locksmith to come so they actually showed up like in 10 to 15 minutes I was very surprised because they were very fast the technician that came out of the van was very polite he was very reasonable and he did a very great job.like he did the job so quick it's crazy he gave me a spare key. I got 2 keys for the price of obe. which is great. he was very quick he was cheap and he got me going back home if it was not for him I don't know if I would have been home tonight I probably was going to be stranded there until tomorrow morning and I think that they are a very great company so if you ever need help with your keys I recommend that you call them they actually come the time they say they will come and they're not expensive at all and the technician was a pretty cool guy so as for me I would rate them five plus star and yeah I had a good experience overall with it.

<review>I lost the chip sensor for the key to my 2002 Lexus ES 300. I went to the local Lexus dealership, and they quoted me at $800 to make 2 keys for me. I hit up Nir instead, and he made me 2 working keys within an hour of calling him at $400. He is a humble, hard working man; he even declined my offer to tip him for his fast, efficient service. I am 10000% happy that my money went to All American Lock and Key instead of the local dealership.< /review><rating>5<//rating><date>1490472806551<//date><Name>Brian Banks</Name>< UserId.>

< Review>
I had the pleasure of working with this locksmith company when i was in a bind. Nir came in a timely manner and unlocked my car. When mentioning the price he even gave me a discount when I showed proof that I had the same job done for cheaper. To top it all off, he offered to fix my key fob (which has been causing me to get locked out in the first place) for free! I appreciate their good service! 5 stars</Review>

The best key guy I have met by far , every locksmith I dealt with would give me the run around on the price .. he told me up front right when I asked him the total price.. that's all I wanted to know before they came out . I called him back and told him I was a little short and he did it anyway , that was vary cool that he worked with me on this .. brovo to all American lock and key.. he will get all my business from here in out ..< /text>

<text>I went out last night with a couple of a friends in Berkeley, when I got home sometime around 1am, I found out that I lost my keys and could not enter into my apartment. Luckily my phone was on me so I was able to find a locksmith through Yelp. Nir showed up and was very nice and professional, after verifying that I do indeed live in the apartment, he was able to unlock the door and let me in. I would totally recommend All American Lock and Key, as they helped me greatly!< /text>< resp>

I was late for a meeting in Oakland and was in so much hurry that I locked my car keys inside my 2013 Ford Focus and only realized it until the meeting was over and I couldn't find my keys in my purse. A coworker tried to help me break into my car but we almost broke the window, so we had to stop and get a professional locksmith. I found their information online and called right away, since they were the closest ones to where I was. Nir, the locksmith, showed up and was very nice and seemed to have a lot of experience as a locksmith, he opened my car within a few minutes, and I was able to get my keys and go on with my day. Thank you for the help!</review>

<text>I called on a Saturday at about 1 in the afternoon needing a locksmith. I had traveled 2.5 hours to our destination  in Alameda in heavy traffic and upon our arrival we realized we had forgotten the keys.
All American Lock said he would check with his technician and call me back.   I never heard back and I tried for 2 hours to reach him again.  I will NEVER call this company here again.

We are actually going to install a keypad system so this doesnt happen again...I will not be calling them for a quote.< /text>< pics>

I called All American Lock and Key last week, when we had to change the locks due to break in attempt (North Oakland) that destroyed our front door locks. The locksmith was friendly, knowledgeable and very patience.  The service was for our business but I will not hesitate to call All American Lock and Key for our home or vehicle locks when needed. I found my local Oakland locksmith<//Review>

<text>While traveling in the Bay Area, I lost my 2010 Mercedes GLK350 and needed service at the Oakland Airport. I spent hours looking for a locksmith that can fabricate a key fob for my car and then I called All American Lock & Key.
The service was excellent, the dispatch was friendly and the technician was super accommodating. I'm glad I didn't listen to all of the locksmith companies that told me it's not doable and I have to wait for the dealer...< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I have been using All American Lock & key locksmith services since 2010.  The response is always fast and the locksmith techs are reliable.

The fact that they travel to your location almost anywhere in the Bay Area is a blessing and super helpful, especially as I live in Berkeley, but spend a lot of time across the Bay as well. From unlocking my house door and releasing a locked bike to cutting and copying keys, they do everything I need.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I went to the laundromat last night and since I was too tired, I accidentally left my house key on one of the laundry machines (I keep it on a separate key chain). When I drove back to get it, I realized the laundromat was closed and calling the owner did not do any good, since his phone was off. I drove back home and was looking for a locksmith through Google and luckily I found All American Lock and Key and called them immediately. The locksmith came over and unlocked the door for me and made me a new key, since I didn't have an extra one. Thank you<//review>

I was visiting my mom in Alameda and had to borrow her car for a couple hours to go get some shopping done. Somehow I managed to misplace her car keys in one of the stores, and after searching all over the place, I wasn't able to locate them and didn't know what to do. One of the store employees suggested I would get a locksmith, and since I didn't want to bother my mom or make her worry, I looked up locksmith services near me and found this wonderful company. After calling and having a locksmith sent my way, the tech has arrived and calmed me down and said he could make me a key right there on the spot. After we spoke to my mom to let her know what was going on and verifying she was the car owner, Nir made the key for me and I was able to calm down and drive back to my mom's house. Thank you so very much!</Text>

<Text>After a long day at work, I got into my 99 Toyota Solara and the ignition wouldn't turn, no matter what I tried to do it was just stuck. After many tries I decided to give up so I don't end up breaking the key inside the ignition. I went on the Yelp app and found All American Lock and Key and call them, a very nice lady named Sally answered the phone and was helpful and told me everything I needed to know and said she's sending out her locksmith. The locksmith has arrived quickly enough and was working on my ignition, you could tell he was a well experienced professional. He fixed the problem and it worked even better than before. I would recommend their service with all my heart!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1499709734530, 'text': 'It was our pleasure to serve you!

Another locksmith warned me about All American lock and key but I was in a tight spot and gave them a shot. BIG MISTAKE!
THE POLICE had to get involved due to vandalism!
What a shame, especially during the holidays.
Best of luck to anyone who calls this company. I'd spend the money to find other services and save the headache.< /review>

Not sure how many time I’ve called for their service (too many to count since I’m prone to losing my keys) but everytime I am met with quick and friendly service. Another plus is the prices are more than reasonable and fair. With All American Lock and Keys I receive same day service which can’t be said about my dealership. Highly recommend Nic’s service if you are ever in need.

Thanks again Nic for the friendly and quick help :)</text>

My first experience with Nir, I was recommended to him by the parts department guys @ the dealership I was at trying to get a replacement key for my car. The dealership wanted an outrageous amount and I needed all sorts of proof of ownership this and that, blah blah blah and even then I would have to wait for the key to be made and then shipped to me (2-3 business days). Sorry I just don't have the time for that! the car was registered in my dads name so imagine the hell I was going through just trying to get into my car. So I call Nir, he shows up within 1hr at most. immediately diagnoses my problem and lets me know ahead of time that I will most likely need the key to my car and a new steering column lock. he says its no problem, he gets to work, and by the end of the day, maybe 3-4 hrs max he has a new steering lock installed and has a brand new matching key, for believe it or not around 1/3 of what the dealership wanted. Not only that, he came to me so I didn't have to tow my car, and he had me back on the road with in hours. He is very professional and explains the situation very clearly so that you understand the work he is going to perform.

Fast forward a couple weeks, and my ECU burned up on my 01 Toyota 4runner. I replace the ECU but the car wont start, It just cranks. after some research I realize the car immobilizer doesn't recognize my car, and now I must reprogram the ECU to match my old key....So who do I call, once again Nir came to the rescue. This time he shows up in around 30 min. Again explains what he will be doing, gets to work and with in an hour- yes you guessed it Nir had me back on the road again...and it was for a wholeeeee lot less then if I had gone to the dealership- and once again I didn't have to tow my car to a shop. I am beyond please with me experiences so far with All American Lock and Key and especially with Nir.

Thanks for the amazing customer service!< /Review>

These guys are amazing.  We lost our only keys to our Mini Cooper and we had to move the car right away.   We called everyone and no one wanted to come out and help us.  We called this shop and they came all the way from Oakland to Rodeo in 30 mins.  Within 30 mins we had a new set of keys and he charged us a very fair price.  They Rock!!  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!  You saved the day!< /review>

The Keyfob to my car had ceased and left me stranded a few cities away. I had spare keyfobs at home but they needed to be programmed. I got a ride home and called A. A. Lock and key to get a price to program the two keyfobs I had. The price they gave me was cheaper than that of the local locksmith I would take my car to. We agreed to meet within the hour and everything went to schedule and he even got to my stranded car moments before I did so I did not have to wait. I would say that within a minute of plugging his device he programmed both of my keyfobs. For a first experience of ever requesting mobile locksmith services they were great. They were fast, reliable, very friendly and good prices. From now on any locksmith work I have I will be sure to call A. A. Lock and Key.< /review>

Yesterday I was going to visit my grandpa, when I arrived I found him sitting outside, waiting for me. Turned out he had misplaced his house keys and could not remember where he put them. Since my father was too far to come open the door for us with his key, I decided to call a locksmith. I was looking through Yelp and found some great reviews on All American Lock and Key's page and decided to give them a try, since it was my first time ever to call a locksmith service. Sally was very nice and sent her guy my way. Nir has arrived and verified that my grandpa was the owner of the house and was very professional about it. Within a few minutes we were able to get in. If I'm ever in need of a locksmith, I have their phone number saved on my phone and will gladly use their services again!<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>ALL AMERICAN LOCK AND KEY HELPED ME OUT BIG TIME AND I COULDNT THANK U ENOUGH FOR ALL YOUR TIME, WORK AND FRIENDLINESS. I just want to take a moment and share my experience with All American but a little more on the person who gave me hope after I almost was ready to give up and that is NIR!

** a few months ago i somehow managed to break the key fob to my 2003 SAAB 9-3 so I left it sitting for quite sometime til I was able to get together a lil extra cash to replace it. When that time came let's just say it was my worst nightmare. I called every single locksmith I could find in the bay area and because this car is so UNIQUE, FORIEGN, AND NO LONGER MADE a lot of people not only just turned me down saying they didnt service this car but I also got others quoting me up to 900$ just to come out and do the job. THANKFULLY NIR was the best blessing for me he was the last person I called that not only quoted me at more then half the price on my car then every other locksmith but even stated he can make it to me that same day to make it!!! HE IS AMAZING. he showed up on time, did his job in a friendly professional manner and THERE IT WAS WITH JUST A QUICK JUMP START FROM HIM IT POWERED RIGHT BACK UP AND 2 WEEKS LATER AND IM STILL SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR. THANK U SO MUCH NIR. IM DEFINITELY RECOMMENDING U TO ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS I COULDNT THANK U ENOUGH.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I lost my BMW key at a party last night, after 3 hours of searching for the key and 2 hours of looking for a locksmith that can actually program BMW keys I found All American Lock and Key. The locksmith tech came over within the giving time and the key was cut and programmed then and there. Great service, highly recommended.< /text><gmap_id>0x808f87173dc7c96d:0xef69565217a5faeb< /gmap_id><date>1452803482619<//date>< user_name>

We called All American Lock & Key to unlock our car and see if the key fob was inside, to our surprise the tech made a new key to our Mercedes right there in the middle of the park!
Must say I didn't know this type of service exist, 6 starts if I could, absolutely amazing locksmith service.< /review>

One of the most reliable and honest pricing around. He came a hour away from Oakland at 9 pm just so i could get my keys. Other companies usually dont even make bmw keys and if they did they were outrageous prices. Thank you again we found the keys we lost though.😅<//text>

<Text>I lost my Uhaul key and I badly needed a new one in order to use the Uhaul to pick up equipment for a film I’m shooting. I called multiple locksmiths and none of them could help me. Then I called All American Lock and Key and they promptly sent a locksmith named Nir to accommodate me. Not only was he very helpful and polite, but he was also very quick with his work. He got me a new key in no time. This is hands down the best locksmith company I’ve ever encountered. Thanks Nir! You rock homie!< /Text>< pictures>

We called AALK last night to change the locks on our house.
The technician arrived pretty fast and did a great job, our new locks are now high security locks, it looks much better than what we had before and the security level of the new locks is much better.
The locksmith also rekeyed the locks so we can use the same key for all, he was friendly and really knowledge, I was surprised of how equipped the mobile shop is. I programmed their number to my cell and would not hesitate to call them for service again.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I'm taking this liberty to write this review on my very nice experience with All American Lock and Key.  My vehicle was stolen and vandalize. After a week has past the police located the vehicle, however the ignition switch along with the driver door and back door locks was also broken.  After call ing  several lock smiths no one except All American would come to my residents to fix it.  Nir  was not only professional but he gave great prevented advice.  Not only he has a fair price for the work he did, he also replace a second key at no cost.  Mercedes Benz dealer wanted to charge me $300.00  and he did it free.  I really appreciate this kind gesture coming from him. Thank again and you have a customer for life</review>< pics>

They give you a comeon quote of $35 plus extra depending on what they need to do.  The service was listed as .8 miles away when I called them at 4:45 pm Sunday.  For a basic qwikset laundrey room lock, the sericeman quoted $165 to pick or $180 if he had to drill.  After he picked the lock in less than 10 minutes, he jacked the price to $180 anyway, which I paid.  I could have bought a drill and new lock for about $70 and done it myself.<//Text>

My absolute favorite place to eat Mexican food here in the South Bay Area of Los Angeles! :-) the food is awesome and very authentic and decently priced! You really need to come try it! There are several locations throughout the South Bay!</text>

<review>So good! Love it here because the workers are so nice and the food is delicious. I got the albondigas soup and it’s a great serving and was so so good. If you come make sure you have cash because when I went they only accepted cash.<//review>< Pics>

<review>I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this great place. Well it was a fabulous evening and the place was undoubtedly the reason for that successful celebration. The crew  collaborated in a gorgeous way, the cooking was delicious and my buddies were very  thrilled. We shall definitely visit again for more events. Thank you very much.</review>< Response>

Best Mexican food in town surprisingly low priced, Burritos are big they really give a lot of fresh made chips & salsa they also give you 4 different types of salsa which all taste great !<//review>

<text>First thing cash only, be prepared. Prices a little high but Burrito does come with a soda and chips. Instead of chips you get whole fried corn tortillas and a variety of salsas more then enough for one person. Carnitas was very good not to greasy and big portion. Service was very professional.<//text>< pictures>

This is by far the best LBJ Location,  the food is to die for and the prices are really low. My wife and I always get the special C with extra cheese and I love the super Carne asada deluxe wet burrito.... yummy. Its not the safest location but its really authentic Mexican food. The staff is nice and your order will be ready extremely quick..</text>

Very friendly people! But for me the burrito was very plain. The guacamole tasted old the meat inside was not seasoned and they didnt give me chips it was huge tostadas. But it was cheap and the people were nice.<//Review>

LBJ is always a sure thing! Cash only, plenty of parking and plenty of space for all to wait safely for their meal. It's also in a fun location being surrounded by other shops for the impatient or antsy one. A smoke shop, an adult store a doughnut shop to name a few are walking distance to browse.</text>

The #25 Beef Taco, Relleno, Rice & Bean was also really nice and cheesy.  The beef was dry and complemented well with the cheesy toppings.</Review><rating>4< /rating>< resp>

Yummy and affordable mexican food. Chips are light and slightly greasy, just like they should be. Staff is friendly and they even remember my favorite items! They only accept cash payments so be sure to plan in advance for this.<//review>

It's certainly not the best Mexican food. But I do love their salsa and they're very generous with their chips and salsa. And some of the food is quite good. I especially like the shredded beef< /review>

It was good, I was looking for breakfast but they stop serving at 11 am. That is not good, but that is theirs policy,  I had a chicken soup, the chicken had a funny flavor,  like it was not cooked with the soup, like it was put in after the soup was cooked. Costumer service was okay.
Prices for the soup too high.</review>

<Review>When I was younger this place was very good, but over the years it went downhill. Recently my boyfriend and I went to buy some lunch. We  bought some burritos. My boyfriend ordered it with no onion. And they still gave it to him with no onion and messed up the burrito by adding chicken instead of asada. We got the receipt and it showed that she charged us for a breakfast platter instead of the burritos. So she charged us $1 more and we still recieved the wrong food. Never going there again.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Terrible customer service, the messed up my order and refused to fix it without me returning the tacos they made wrong within the 10 minutes before they closed (my son could pick them up on way home, I explained I am having hip surgery and not driving and my daughter has a baby she is watching and couldn't make it back on 10 minutes). He told me I could wait till tomorrow and return them tomorrow and get new ones tomorrow,  I asked what am I supposed to eat tonight. He said "Oh, Um I don't know." I asked if we could just keep these and eat them tonight and get the ones I ordered and paid for another time. He said he absolutely could not allow that. He needed to get the other ones back from me. So I told him if I have to bring it back tonight I am bringing all my food back and want a refund. He told me "sure no problem." I have been going once a week for over 7 years. He even mentioned it when we first picked up order he knew our order without giving the number. But apparently loyalty means nothing, no customer service, they are rude and think you are out to steal. They don't speak English well and apparently don't know the difference between Chicken and ground beef! I will never go back to this location,  Redondo Beach is far from me,  but better service!< /review><pics>None<//pics></record>

Not that great for me, first time, probably last time. Ordered a burrito and horchata and  it was bland and rarely any taste to the meat, horchata was minty for some reason. To top it off they could of mentioned they only take cash when I ordered not when it's ready and I'm handing my card to you, I was forced to use an ATM that they have. Nah not going back.<//Text>

I can’t speak for the other locations but the lomita location isn’t what it’s cracked up to be. Now 8-10 years ago this was the spot for some great food. But ever since the restaurant changed ownership or management some years ago the food is just average and the portions got smaller and prices more expensive and overall quality of food and service sealed the fate of elbjs lomita. Sadly I made several attempts to give them another shot but I’ve only managed to end up disappointed telling myself I told ya so. Now instead of going to the convenient spot I went to for 20+ years I go out of my way and go to el Tarasco or super gallieto or anywhere but el burrito jr in lomita. A life long customer lost forever because of horrible service,customer relations, food quality and portion size and overpriced menu.</Text>

<Review>Always come to this place like 10 years ago, love to buy extra chips to eat with the salsa.
Asked today if I could pay for extra chips the lady look back at the chips container and tells me, no sorry I can't because those are the last ones!! Please just fry some more. That's it.</Review>< Date>

Charge way too much , not enough meat in their super deluxe burrito and guacamole was too thin and only a splash of sour cream ! Paid  $25.19 for 2 lousy burritos . And all there food Is extremely high priced . They were supposed to be wet burritos , but barely any sauce either . Carnitas  meat very dry and not flavorful . Actual value of food approx. $5.00 and 20.00 was clear profit !!!! Used to be the best , but now the worst !!! Service was not attentive , unfriendly and nonappreciative !!!<//Text>

<Text>My family and I have come to this location a couple of times. The food has always been adequate but this time, the food took a long time to be ready. When given to us the plates were hot but the food was cold. Some of our plates were even burnt. They had four cooks and every plate we had was horrible. Would not recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Today I tried something different from El burrito. The carne asada burrito and it was just disgusting. I never had such nasty carne asada like I did today. The flavor was bad, the meat had a pink color to it and looked like undercooked hamburger meat.

I called the store and got a refund and told the girl about my order and was refunded immediately. So thank you for that. I am always weary of buying carne asada from Mexican places because only few make it how I like it. Which is browned and marinated and minced well, no chewy or fat peices. I recommend king taco in long beach or tortilla grill in Lancaster CA.

All in all I don't recommend this place, overpriced and low quality food. Try the more better locations such as Torrance Blvd or the one higher up on PCH.
Also don't get the carne asada, they don't use a high quality meat or marinade.

Thanks. But no thanks.</review>

<text>I've been  eating LBJ since I could walk and I have to say that this was the worst I've ever had from them tonight.  To make it worse there always good tasting salsa was  not so good. Is this normal for this location? I've always gone to the one in Redondo Beach.

To top it off they even goofed on our order and made my super deluxe burrito the same as my girls.

Bad salsa.. incorrect order...< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Absolutely wonderful experience today visiting Hilltop Farms and meeting Denise. She was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable to guide us as new backyard chicken hobbyist. I was so excited to learn about different breeds and they had simple & very helpful notebooks for us to review. Went for 2 chicks and came home with 5!!! :)</Review>< pics>

Such a lovely experience! Patrick and his family are absolutely adorable and so helpful! I order 6 french black copper marans and 3 Isbar eggs and I received 11! They were super helpful every step of the way! I ran into issues because there was a delay in my incubator shipping but Patrick was happy to accommodate! I have never incubated eggs before and he was so helpful, and I had so many questions. He even helped me organize where to place the eggs. Would definitely recommend and order from again.< /Text>

Hilltop Farms is THE place to get poultry. We are new to chickens, and Patrick was so helpful. He told us everything we would need and helped us pick the chickens that would accomplish what we wanted. An added perk, he is always available to answer questions for us newbies. All 20 chicks were healthy, bright eyed, and feathery-tailed! Aside from being a great place to pick up poultry, Patrick has all the supplies you would ever need including feed, and wood shavings. Truly a one-stop shop!  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!<//Text>

Patrick and Hilltop Farms are outstanding!  I highly recommend and would definitely get any other chicks I am looking for in the future from him. I got 4 Lavender Americauna chicks. I ordered ahead since they are in demand and popular right now. I was able to get them about 2 weeks ahead of schedule when he had a big hatch. All 4 were healthy and active and ADORABLE. He was great about making sure we knew what we needed (we were already set up but I really appreciated he made himself available for questions and to make sure people knew that their chicks needed heat etc - just shows he cares about the animals).  Our chicks are now a couple weeks old and doing really well. They are inquisitive and sweet and do great with my 5 year old. PLUS they have to be the cutest chicks I have ever seen. Thanks again Patrick!< /Review>

<text>We picked up several chics and a duck. The birds are all happy and healthy. Patrick is very knowledgeable about the birds and their personality’s. After talking to him over the phone and meeting him I was impressed with his care and concern about how we would be taking care of the birds. This is a legitimate business and not a backyard breeder. We will gladly purchase birds from Patrick at Hill top farms again.</text></record>

<review>Our experience with Hilltop Farms was great! The whole process from ordering our silkie chicks online through picking them up went smoothly. Our kiddos enjoyed being able to choose what chicks they wanted to take home. Patrick was very friendly and knowledgeable. We will be back when we’re ready for more chicks.< /review><username>Anna Christian-Reeve<//username><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

<Text>Patrick at Hilltop Farms has been the best place we have bought our chickens from. We started a chicken family several years ago. And by far Patrick at Hilltop has the best knowledge, service, selection and truly cares for the chickens and it shows. We have bought 18 from him, all are very healthy and doing great. We bought from another location, they were always dying and we had to keep going back to replace.
So go see Patrick at Hilltop Farms in Corona to see the great selection and healthy birds. It has just been a great experience. Thanks Patrick. All the babies are getting big and doing awesome.<//Text>< Pictures>

I had a wonderful experience getting first baby chicks from Patrick.  After a bad experience with one of the big hatcheries ( my order which my whole family was been anticipating for a couple month didn't get shipped by their error) I've reached out to Hilltop Farm.    Patrick got back to me quickly and he provided me with 8 healthy chicks and also HAND-DELIVERED them to my home in Rural area.  I would definitely recommend Hilltop Farm !!! Again Thank you, Patrick!</text>

<Review>So much to say...  Hilltop Farms has great reviews and carry the special breeds we've been looking for. (Croad Langshans are not easy to come by in our town and even their hatching eggs aren't easy to find.) They were very accomodating when I placed an order and didnt see that they only ship within CA. (We live out of state.)  It was well worth the 8 hour round trip. They have such an amazing breed selection amd all the chicks we got are healthy so far. Yes, communication is slow but this is a family business at the peak of chick season. It's unreasonable to expect corporate level customer service from people who are running every aspect of their operation themselves.
Thanks for everything Patrick and family!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcb9b04477da51:0xbe850c03818561e5< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hilltop farms has spectacular service. I told them that I was looking for a female duck and not a drake and they let me inspect the ducks so that I could figure out which one was female and the appropriate match for me. Because of this I was gifted with a beautiful female cayuga that I couldn't love more. She was hand friendly and allowed me to hold her the entire hour and a half ride home. When I thought that I may have an issue with the Turkey that I had brought home, they responded to my questions ASAP and stuck with me giving me advice until my little guy was okay. And even 4 months after when my other ducks began to lay fertile eggs and I had issues with successful hatching, they talked me through the entire process and gave me great advice and now my little guys are making it through hatching. Thank you so much Hilltop farms!!</text>

Hilltop Farms has made my flock a pretty fancy one. They have a unique selection of different breeds and more importantly all are healthy!  Patrick has been very helpful in getting me started with my chicks, answered my questions and provided support with his knowledge of the chickens and breeds he provides.<//text>

<review>Patrick and his team at Hilltop Farms are incredible. Even under the particular circumstances and stresses of Covid, Patrick walked me through the ordering process on the phone, and was easy to contact via phone/text. My chicks are doing great, I plan on picking up 3 more in fact, and feel really good knowing that they come from a healthy, caring, and contemporary local farm. Thank you Patrick and co.!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

If you're looking for top quality hens and roosters give Patrick fron Hilltop Farms a call. I recently purchased a French Black Copper Maran Rooster from Patrick for my own small breeding program and couldn't be happier.< /Review>

I live in southwestern Alaska, off the road system, and not only was Hilltop willing to ship fertile eggs to me (which many vendors aren’t) the packaging was amazing as was the customer service. I have almost two dozen eggs in lockdown as I type! Highly recommend these guys for your poultry needs.<//Review>

<review>I got 4, one week old silkie chicks from hilltop farms. The two smaller ones ended up passing away but that's to be expected, Mother Nature. The other two are huge and healthy and so sweet and friendly. Because of COVID-19 there was a huge shortage of chicken supplies but he provided everything I needed right there when I picked out my chicks curbside! Highly recommend them!< /review>< Rating>

Patrick provided me 4 healthy baby buff orpingtons. Despite being slammed with customers after the Corona virus quarantine was lifted, he was very attentive and rapid to respond to my emails and answered all of my questions. Being a first time chicken owner with a small order, he treated me with the utmost respect and patience. I was very happy my experience dealing with Hilltop Farms amd would recommend them for all your live poultry needs.<//Text>

Best experience ever! I came out to Hilltop farms in Corona, and got to meet the owner Patrick and his family. They were honest and super knowledgeable. He gave me a tour of the farm and it was spacious and very nice. The coops were clean and the birds seemed well taken care of. They were giving them fresh produce and organic feed while I was there. They have a huge selection of specialty birds to pick from than most places in Southern California. The birds were healthy and the prices are good compared to the surrounding areas. I got to hold a couple of different chickens while I was there, and they were friendly. I also got eggs while I was there. They were multicolored and delicious. I will definitely return and refer him to all of my friends and family! I am now obsessed with backyard chickens!< /text>

My babies are growing up and are very warm, friendly and responsive. It seems they got a lot of attention. This place is not a mill. It’s clear they spend time with the hens, roosters, and baby chicks. All of mine let me pick them up and hold them without any strongly at all. That speaks to the upbringing.  I’ll be back when I’m ready to grow my chicken family. 😊</text>< Pics>

We were new to chickens when I contacted Hilltop. Patrick walked us through every step and was very knowledgeable.  They even offer all the supplies you need to start!!
Not only do they have a very diverse, healthy and happy collection they are very helpful as well. I recommend this farm to all of my chicken crazy friends as well as anyone even considering having a chicken or two. Do yourself a favor and do your poultry business with this farm.<//review>

<Review>Two words, Variety & Quality. The moment I stepped foot on Hill Top Farms, I was welcomed as family and provided with 5 Star Service from beginning to end. I now know so much more about chickens and how to raise them thanks to Hill Top Farms, you can't learn these tricks online. I refer all my friends, family, and farmers. The owner and family are passionate about their chickens, look no further, this is your solution for CHICKENS.</Review>< Pictures>

So the positive is the place is fairly clean and they have a broad selection of breeds.

Sorry to say that’s where it ends.

First off when Patrick says his eggs are “pastured”
And rotated daily it’s a complete lie. This place is on the side of a mountain no flat land.... no bigger then maybe at most 3 acres and 90% of it is for construction equipment storage ect. I’m sure that is what pays for his “farm” since it’s not his property but regardless. There are zero pastures, the pictures of birds on green grass are from a small backyard lawn behind their house. Also all of his products and so called organic feed is just Manna pro feed that he marks up as he’s a middle man and really doesn’t use quality feed like scratch and peck..

Sadly it gets worse. He will not stand behind his birds, products or own up to mistakes. He will hide
And make excuses for any problems that arise. Trust me If you want details message me!

Ultimately this place is basically a joke hobby for a guys who will not be in business 5 years from now.

Just beware< /review>

{'time': 1555291542015, 'text': 'I’m sorry for your experience and the mistake. We tried to make it right by offering 5 chicks of the correct breed or a dozen hatching eggs for free to make up for the mistake. Some breeds look very similar as chicks and it’s very hard to tell them apart. The wrong breed was sold because we bought chicks from a breeder to bring in new bloodlines and they sold us the wrong kind, as you know, we had no idea until they started laying the wrong colored eggs.  Once again sorry for the experience.'}<//resp>

Clean and delightful -- When I visited to pick up my chicks, it was clear they well cared for.  I got everything I needed to get started, including materials, advice, and reassurance that if I had any questions in the future, I could always reach out to ask.< /text>

<text>After looking online for coop ready hens for a few weeks, I stumbled across Patrick’s website and made an inquiry (I am very much the chicken novice). Patrick called me that evening and he explained to me the differences in breeds and detailed the breeds he had on hand. I was even able to text him pictures of my chicken coop and get his feedback on how many hens would be best. When my wife and kids and I went to his farm to get our hens I had planned on getting only 4 to start with, but after seeing his selection we ended up going home with 7 chickens!  Patrick took great care to explain all the differences between the breeds and answered every one of my questions!  He was incredibly nice and is very thorough!  If I ever need any additional hens I would definitely recommend Patrick’s Hilltop Farms in Corona!<//text>< pictures>

Very disappointed with this place,  never notified me that my order was ready to pick up I tried calling them, left voice message, didn't get a reply,  finally got a hold of them by fb messenger and told me they didn't have my birds in stock, finally when I asked for a refund, they tell me that they had my order ready since like 2 weeks, I go to pick up my birds and they try to charge me extra because the birds where past 2 weeks old,  so I  told him I was not going to pay more since they never contacted me, but the owner argued that send me emails notifying me about my order been ready, and that he even tried calling me but it was all a lie so at the end I didn't even get the birds I payed for and I also got two sick birds one died and all this took placet in 4 months, placed my order on line on March and barely got my birds on June 3rd</text>

<text>I ate here two nights in a row. The first night I got the 4 street tacos combo which came with a kids size drink for $4.99. The tacos were good but there was way too much lettuce or cabbage whatever it was. The next night I got the Papis favorite burrito and it was ok. If I have known they used pinto beans I wouldn’t have got a burrito. And it doesn’t say it comes with lettuce but they sure did put it in there while also forgetting to add the sour cream and guacamole that it says it comes with. As far as the meat it really wasn’t anything special I mean I could hardly tell it was there. Way to kill the craving I had for carne asada, thank you!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrI_nSjVZW9_vtT6O_ik247tzvOg5WWcKuf-Bp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEgURGbvxj9dThXuPPJ33qNtVqKTjTqpKZEAMN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Ordered carne asada fries and asada burrito. Fries are awesome, it's legit when they know not to add beans (beans are the bane of my existence). Crisp fries with flavorful meat, salsa and cheese! Definitely will come back. Same with the burrito. Will make it a point to come back. Highly recommend</Review>

<text>My burrito was huge and the meat itself had a really good flavor... when you could find any of it. There was a tiny amount of asada. Also didn’t get sour cream in my papis burrito and got what I’m pretty sure was a rotten avocado. I won’t be eating here again.</text>< Rating>

<Text>Rocios catering was a perfect addition to our wedding. We absolutely loved their food and so did our guests. They were very easy to work with and we greatly appreciate all of their communication. They prepared so much food for us during our tasting and provided great costumer service. We cannot thank their team enough for being apart of our day and preparing some of the best tacos we have ever had!<//Text>< rate>

<Text>Delicious food!  Everything tastes fresh. Homemade corn tortillas for tacos. Burritos are super sized! Extremely friendly service.

The one star goes to the fresh cilantro, cabbage, lemon and the onion I didn't ask for. The veggies were fresh BUT food was not great. The rice was under seasoned or not seasoned at all. The beans tasted as if they had went bad. The asada was over seasoned which I thought, ok, it will make up for the lack of taste of everything else.....but the homemade corn tortillas were not thoroughly cooked, still raw. Which caused my tacos to break while eating them. Should've went back for a refund but didn't have the time. Will not be going back. On the plus, the lady was friendly.< /Review>

Pretty good food.  I went through their drive through and ordered for multiple people,  I definitely should have called ahead because I was in line for quite a long time. That's not their fault,  it's a restaurant, you shouldn't expect the same wait times as a fast food place.  The food was okay<//text>

<review>Yesterday was my first time going to rocios drive thru , I wanted to try their food since it has good reviews .  Asada fries were ok , the fries were a little too hard , I also got half a dozen of the tamales . Pork,chicken cheese an jalapeño . The tamales are not that good . The green chicken one doesn’t have chicken inside same with the cheese tamal . The tamales are supposed to be stuffed with a good portion of meat inside not just the dough .</review>< pictures>

COMPARE IT TO MOONEY BLVD RESTAURANT EI TARASCCO AND ROCCIOS WINS. OH YA THE PRICE DIFFERENCE GOT THE SAME SIZE SOUP CONTAINER IS ABOUT $3-4 MORE AT EL TABASCO.

Taco meat(pork) had hard small bits, not freshly prepared pork. Carne Asada Quesadilla- the meat was also like it was leftover and reheated and hard.  The homemade corn tortillas were fresh and wonderful.  Too bad the rest of the meal was not. Rocios used to be very good, hopefully they will return to their previous standard of delicious, freshly prepared food.</Text>

< Review>
One of our favorite hangouts in OB when we visit. We came the other night not realizing that they close early. They never gave any indication they wanted us to leave. Super friendly service, great food and drinks. COVID safe. Extremely accommodating to pets. Amazing view, great people. You won't be disappointed.</Review>

Amazing breakfast, even better views right on the ocean! Sweet potato hash is a winner, as well as the burrito. I noticed the guy sitting not too far from us who got the eggs Benedict and that looked pretty sweet, so I tried not to be creepy while I took a picture of it. You’re welcome!< /Review>

Great spot with incredible views of the ocean (if you visit on a non-farmers market day). Drinks a tasty and the food is amazing! Staff was very nice. If you're sitting outside, make sure to be seated in the sun or near a heater, because it can be quite cold in the shade.< /text>

Lovely brunch place right next to the Ocean beach.
Me with my boys wanted a good spot to get our day started and this place did not disappoint.

Variety of options to choose from , right from savory to sweet and all of us were pleased with the quality of the food and the service.

<Review>Not happy with my experience here. Slow service,  servers with blinders on, and a manager who says, sorry it's been rough. What they need is a staff with more training</Review>< Pics>

Incomprehensibly terrible waitress. 1 hour wait for drinks, the place was MAYBE 20% capacity. Asked how we wanted our check, we said split, she responded, can we not do that? Food was incredible but FUHHHCK. GET SOME DECENT SERVICE. I'd call her out by name but she wasn't wearing a name tag. Seriously, wow. Edit: waitress - Adrienne, check yourself.</Text>

Good location with outdoor seating with great ocean views. The food was  not great but not bad either. The service was awesome and did well with COVID 19 precautions.</Text>

They were about to close but still had many people in. All the seats right now are separated with plastic shields, plenty available outside and inside. Their menu is different from what you see online - no tacos and only salmon/tuna/shrimp from the seafood options. No catch of the day neither. I had crab cakes-one of very few seafood options; and  hot chicken biscuit. Seemed like crab cakes is not a popular item - took awhile to arrive, actually the side dish it came with was amazing, crabcakes itself - okay, too mushy to my taste. Hot chicken biscut was great (came with fries). Biscuit was perfectly warm and slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft inside. Fried chicken was juicy and well seasoned - not too spicy though. Nice variety of drinks available - craft local beers, wines and selections of good quality spirits.</text>

Great lunch or brunch place with an ocean view! Vegetarian options too. Dog friendly and decent service. Definitely our go-to when we’re at OB. Good to stop by with the dog either before or after a romp at Dog Beach!<//Text>

I didn't realize they had a decent breakfast menu selection. I thought it was all burgers and beers all the time. The $10 breakfast fruit parfait thing is just some fruit and yogurt in a glass though. I could've made a fresher, more presentable one at home.</Text>

To my surprise the food is cheap and with healthy portions!

Social distancing and mask-wearing are bearing enforced as well.

The only ding was service had been slow to bring water and felt at times the server forgot about us.

Besides that small ding it’s an otherwise awesome spot!</text></record></dataset><record>

Waited 45 minutes for food to be served by a bearded waiter with his beard hanging over the food.  Kids run wild, screaming, drunks.  The management does nothing about it.  If you like chaos this is the place to go.  The restaurant is across a homeless incampment with freaks galore!</Text>

We were waiting so long before anyone came over to take our order. My husband's chicken and biscut was sitting in greese, which they said was the Garlic fries but if so they should have put that in a separate basket or plate. I got the omelet, it was the one w all veggies and it was bland and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting for a while or frozen before cooked. The cold brew coffee was good. I ordered a hot coffee after that and it was on the cold side. To note, the waitress did take my husband's order and my luke warm coffee off the bill. It would be hard for us to return, we will have to try a different place in that same building because we love the view.< /Text>

We were waiting so long before anyone came over to take our order. My husband's chicken and biscut was sitting in greese, which they said was the Garlic fries but if so they should have put that in a separate basket or plate. I got the omelet, it was the one w all veggies and it was bland and the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting for a while or frozen before cooked. The cold brew coffee was good. I ordered a hot coffee after that and it was on the cold side. To note, the waitress did take my husband's order and my luke warm coffee off the bill. It would be hard for us to return, we will have to try a different place in that same building because we love the view.<//Text>

<Text>I'm a visitor to OB traveling alone and they found a nice little spot for me with an ocean view. I had the OB market parfait which was fresh and light, as well as an order of scrambled eggs and bacon. The spicy bloody mary was awesome as was the mai tai! Recommend early Sunday brunch because they get busy!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Their Mai-Thais are dangerous, and I have loved all of the food I’ve eaten there.  I highly recommend the skirt steak, and their fried chicken appetizer.  if you're there early enough for breakfast/brunch, order the french toast with the fruit compote.  Makes a great brunch appetizer for 2 or more, or you can eat that for breakfast.

A dog friendly bar and restaurant.  There are 2 areas for dogs, outside on the deck overlooking the ocean, and on the patio where there is a traditional bar and enclosed seating area.</review>

<review>Sunday brunch had a 45 minute wait but was able to sit immediately at the bar- was craving vegetarian biscuits and gravy and it hit the spot. Biscuits are very similar to Grands Biscuits which I like. Good customer service but would not choose the bar seating there again, constant wind brought in smells from the trash while I ate.< /review><gmapID>0x80deaa3a4cd5c6e5:0x4a7106ced76f8d77<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Visited on 12/15 with my girlfriend. The service was good , very positive attitude. We ordered 2  mimosa flights , pretty good flavors . Salmon toast was amazing , definitely coming back for it . Great views to the ocean . I also ordered the Farro lunch bowl and my friend had a chicken bowl . I thought it was good , but I could use more cauliflower and mushrooms in it . The chicken bowl was great and the tahini sauce was perfect .< /Text>

Sat outside facing the ocean, has a great view. The food was amazing. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked perfectly and was nicely seasoned. The service was excellent. My eggs were a little too over hard for me, there server instantly said she would get more and was back less than 5 min later with new eggs. I highly recommend and will be coming back.<//text><username>Corrinne</username></record></dataset><record>

A great place to go for lunch while at the beach. The staff are all very friendly, also great music being played in the back ground. The chicken burger that I had tasted amazing, it was also well priced.</text>

<time>1550431568832< /time><Text>OB Surf Lodge is "good enough." The service was good and the location was great; can't beat the ocean view. The food itself is good, just nothing worth getting excited about. I had the Carnitas Benny; which is eggs Benedict with Carnitas on top of what I think was an English muffin. The muffin was flat and a bit rough l, Soni couldn't really tell what it was. I had a mimosa flight. It came with 4 kinds of mimosa. They were decent enough, but you could taste the syrup. I'd come back if only for the atmosphere, but there are better brunch spots in OB.</Text>< gmap_id>

Omg the view is amazing from where ever you sit we came for the sunset and wow.  The vibe is great,  and you feel like you are in another world!!! Food was great I had the salmon that was to die for and my fiance had the pork which was tender but lacking a little flavor. Our server Mike was cool and made everything great.  I love this place!< /text>

OB Surf Lodge is "good enough." The service was good and the location was great; can't beat the ocean view. The food itself is good, just nothing worth getting excited about. I had the Carnitas Benny; which is eggs Benedict with Carnitas on top of what I think was an English muffin. The muffin was flat and a bit rough l, Soni couldn't really tell what it was. I had a mimosa flight. It came with 4 kinds of mimosa. They were decent enough, but you could taste the syrup. I'd come back if only for the atmosphere, but there are better brunch spots in OB.<//Text>

A great place to go for lunch while at the beach. The staff are all very friendly, also great music being played in the back ground. The chicken burger that I had tasted amazing, it was also well priced.< /review>

The chicken fried steak was without a doubt the best I have ever had. But honestly everything we tried there was great. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area.<//Review>

Great vibe. Mimosa's were fresh and delicious not horribly sweet or sticky. The menu is to die for and covers all the bases from vegan to fried chicken in a thick biscuit. Overlooks Ocean Beach beautifully and has great decor.< /Review>

We had breakfast here. Great food. Wonderful view of the Pacific Ocean, unfortunately it was a little cloudy the one day we were there.  The breakfast burrito was excellent.  Servers were very attentive.< /Review>

We went in today for a nice meal. The environment was great with beautiful beach views. Placed our food order and received our drinks.  I sent back my lemonade as something was floating in it.  Second lemonade came out with a spider in it.
Yes, a REAL SPIDER!!! How do you not notice a little black spider in a lemonade?...
We informed the waitress there was a spider in my drink. Her response” oh, it’s spider season in San Diego”. Like seriously????
I cancelled our order food and all. If you can’t get a drink right, how do I know what’s in my food!?
The waitress seemed surprised. Sorry gave her two chances to get a drink right and failed both times.<//text>

Super chill atmosphere across from the beach to grab a nice drink! My favorite is the shark attack and it's so nicely made! Great spot to soak in some vitamin d and grab a cocktail, beer, or some good eats!< /Review>

My friend brought me here for breakfast when I was visiting from Phoenix over Thanksgiving. The LEMON FRITTERS!!!! Oh my goodness, AMAZING!  Breakfast was good, yes, but the fritters made me come back and bring my daughters on the next visit. They agreed whole heartedly!</Review>

We arrived when there was no wait. I asked the hostess if she could add another chair to a specific empty table. She replied, "that table is only four chairs." I said, "okay, if it's not possible I understand we'll take whatever is available." She then led us to a back corner on the patio and just threw the menus on the ledge. We seated ourselves and then waited 15 minutes before a server came up to take our order. After the first order, the server hardly ever came to check on us. After sitting for over an hour we finally asked for the check without ordering entrees. I'm sure there was a reason behind why service was bad on a not busy time and the appetizer we did manage to order was delicious but, we will probably not revisit in the future regardless of how the food was.</Text><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Brittney Taylor<//Name>< user_id>

Breakfast here was excellent. I had the classic eggs Benedict and also had biscuits that were legit.

The ocean view is great.<//Text>

Great bloody Marys! One one of the best brunches with beautiful views of the beach in San Diego! It overlooks the beach and the Ocean Beach pier. And the food is delicious. They also have outdoor patios that are dog friendly.</Text>

Had so much excitement to eat at this place from seeing how busy it was. Went to breakfast had the country fried steak and eggs. My eggs were cold my steak cut and tasted like leather. And couldn't eat a second bite with the gravys off taste. On top of that $60 for breakfast for 3 people. Side note ma and pa shop on pier was excellent< /Review>

Good food and good views. Solid happy hour. They have these happy hour biscuit sandwiches that are really tasty. The housemade biscuits are really good. They have a crisp outside and soft inside and are also sturdy enough to not crumble apart with each bite. They have this foam cream stuff they put in some of their beverages that is like crack. Super tasty. I would like to just drink it straight from the whipped cream dispenser contraption they put it in.</Review>

Just happened across this place and it was amazing.  The food was spectacular, the mood is just kind of laid back and friendly.
Ate at the bar, bar tender was friendly and helpful gave me a coupe beer samples to try, great guy.
I'd highly recommend stopping in, enjoy the sunset, beer and awesome food.
Talked to a local and she said everything she had had here is amazing.
Definitely worth trying.< /Review>

<text>Views are amazing. We were seated quickly for a Sunday morning.  Service was fantastic. Locally roasted coffee was very, very good. I had the biscuits and gravy breakfast it was good, made in house according to server. Comes with scrambled eggs and potatoes. My sister had the eggs Benedict and enjoyed it. Overall a good breakfast spot with service putting it over the top. Will definitely be back!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The salmon Benedict was delightful with the right size portions.  (Some Benedicts that I eat leave me still hungry.)  The veggie scramble was also delicious my friend had said, but we forgot to remind them that she ordered there plate with additional mushrooms.  (I don't know if we actually paid for them.) It was a very good experience, but I would remind people to not wait at ther bar for your table, as the hostess doesn't call for you inside or at the bar.</Review>< pics>

Fun atmosphere, beautiful views and a great menu. I went there for brunch and had a strawberry vodka cocktail that was delicious.  My fried chicken biscuit was good but a little dry, my friends chilaquiles were well made but pretty mild.  A little hot sauce perfected both of our dishes.  Service was prompt and helpful, would definitely go back.<//text>

Food was great and they helped us with our strollers. Only complaint is that they were doing free shots for everyone around us but not us. We assumed bc we had babies. Hey- the moms weren't driving- we would have loved some LOL. But really, it was great food and we had fun.</text>

The premium price for the location is fine as the comfort of the ocean view is worth it.

Ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict but instead of lox, got cooked salmon under the poached eggs, wasn't terrible but definitely not what wasn't what I was expecting.

Service took really really long to note</Review>< pics>

<text>My husband declares theirs to be the best spicy bloody ever. Ever! The fried cheddar omelet was unique (I've never had the cheese crisped on the outside), but come on, brocolini & duroc ham still aren't typical for a beach place.  My party of four found the portions generous and well executed. The patio is dog friendly and if you get cold quickly think about bringing a jacket with you in the mornings...the breeze off the beach is phenomenal!<//text>< Pics>

Great food, for both breakfast and dinner. I prefer dinner, they've even made me a mimosa flight when I went at night (and they close it early) I love mimosas!! Great service every time! Staff friendly and willing to help if you have any questions or concerns. Bar is amazing, and good selection of drinks. Try the Barney! 😊 Will be returning regularly and with friends every time!</Text>

<Review>I had the tahini chicken burger and it was delicious! It had a beet aioli and a slab of feta. I was in heaven.

Great location facing the beach. They don’t take reservations so go early. It gets pretty busy on the weekends around brunch time. Service can be a little slow.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_name>Delyanne Barros< /user_name><Response>None< /Response><Time>1572841299721</Time>< UserId.>

<Text>I REALLY like the food at this place if you're not interested in healthy. It's a gluttony paradise, but if you want anything healthy or plant based for breakfast, good luck.  I wish they would include some healthy vegan options. Back when I didn't care about healthy eating I would get the eggs Benedict and OMG, it was SO good!!! This place has an awesome view as well.</Text>< gmapID>

I got the anciet grain bowl and it just did not live up to expectation. I went in a group and I so I got to taste some different things and they have one of the best black bean burgers that I've ever tasted. So that was a positive experience. The fettuccine, the mac and cheese, and the French fries were good.  If you are a vegetarian though make sure you specify for no meat. Two people in our group asked for no meat, but the server failed to point ot that the sauce had meat and the dishes had to be sent back. Overall we had a good time with mostly good food. Just a caution though to be sure you know what you're getting.</text>

< Review>
This place is amazing. It looks awesome inside and out, the food is amazing, and it's all just... Cool as hell. I will be honest; the immediate, "Hello and welcome! Find any seat you'd like." with being handed a menu for my mother and I, felt good. Though the wait for the initial food and drink service did take some time, it is understandable given it is a slow morning. The waitress was kind and wasn't too energetic, which kinda went hand in hand with the theme of the place. I did feel bad though, because I was enjoying the entirety of the brunch menu, but I ultimately settled on the Smothered Omelette with apple juice. You can't go wrong with anything on the brunch menu, everything just sounds so good, and then when you get the actual plate, it's even better. 5/5 Will take family and friends here again.</Review>

Amazing views.  Beautiful and delicious food.  A must if you are looking to kick it on style and enjoy some Bloody Mary's, mimosa's, or day time cocktails.  Check it out for a popping night scene as well.</review>

Great bloody Marys! One one of the best brunches with beautiful views of the beach in San Diego! It overlooks the beach and the Ocean Beach pier. And the food is delicious. They also have outdoor patios that are dog friendly.< /Review>

First time here, wasn't bad right at the start. It was our service that was bad. Our server Monique, was not very nice, she said we couldn't keep a menu to keep looking. Which we would have ordered more drinks or food. But couldn't look at a menu...then when our drinks came, a frozen drink, it didn't come with a straw. Understanding, San Diego restaurants are not serving them without requests now. But then when she brought them to us, she basically tossed them at us. Willing to come again, the food and other drinks people had looked good. Just not going to sit in Monique's area.</Review>

<Review>This place is great. I've been here 10+ times, and they have always been able to facilitate the small or large party of people that I bring with minimal wait time. Also the polenta shrimp is where at!! Great food AND drink menu. I always try something different, and I'm never disappointed.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1547850858404, 'text': "Hey Ben! Thanks for the great review.

My husband and I had our first date here when it was Shades in April 2007. We love the ocean view, the surfers, the dogs, and all the local color. It's our special place. The new management seems to have captured the essence of this sacred OB space - right on the water, next to the OB Pier, casual but elegant too. It's a bit pricier than it use to be - Bloody Mary's were $10 each, breakfast was $15 each, and a $50 dollar bill after we looked up from the waves. It didn't use to cost that! Nonetheless, we always go to this spot when we're visiting San Diego from the Palm Springs desert area. The OB Pier is our special spot. I just wish the new management had a drink special for us budget travelers. We shouldn't have to carry an AMEX card to go here.  This is OB man!<//Text>

Everything coming out looked amazing. We had the Point Loma omelette and the breakfast burrito. Excellent. Price was right also. $40 bucks for two with drinks< /Text>

The sweet potato dish is awesome!  I used to come here when it was Shades and can say that Surf Lodge is an upgrade. We were headed to Wonderland for a late breakfast/early brunch but they were closed so we ended up at the Lodge instead. We weren't disappointed. Great food, great view, and cool staff.<//Text>

It is generally pretty good, be careful of burnt pancake being strategically placed at the bottom of the stack, happened more than once.  Update: Their pancakes seem much more consistent and always fluffy and nice these days, great job. Love everyone working there. Bumping up from 4 to 5 stars.< /Review>

Fancy homestyle food with Californian / Mexican influences. Some food brunch and lunch options, tons of omlettes and some good sandwiches to boot. Good view of the ocean from the house, the inside would be better in the winter given the close proximity to the ocean.</Review>

< Review>
Its been at least 30 minutes since we have been seated which was also a wait, and i have seen any servers out besides behind the bar. Just wondering if ill ever get service?? Kinda wanted to at least try the food
(UPADTE): I realize they must be understaffed for mothers day, but we had to walk over a grab our own drinks from the bar to see THE MANAGER TAKING SHOTS AT THE BAR, when we complain they tell us they are doing a great job and that we should tone it down. The waitress that helped us was running around like crazy trying to help people and was obviously stressed out and he had the nerve to tell us he was doing all he could do.
THE FOOD: Was actually great when it got here. I was very happy with my breakfast burritos  and the only reason i gave more than one star would be for the food.
Service needs improvement</Review>

My family and I went here today around noon to have lunch. The guy in the front said it would be about 15 minutes till we are seated. It took a bit longer but after reading the great reviews, we didnt mind. When we were finally seated around 12:40, the waitress took our drink order. The drinks came out quickly and we ordered shortly after. We noticed a couple who was seated prior to us still did not have their food and it was already 1. We waited almost an hour and still no food. Our waitress said the kitchen was backed up and said the food should come out soon. We saw a table of 5 near us get their food an hour later even though they were seated after us. The manager told my fiance they would push up our order. We waited over an hour for our waitress to then tell us our order would be placed in front. We ended up walking out after being there a total of 2 hours with no food. We wish we would have had a better experience but it seems like an hour wait for food is normal here. We had two kids with us and didnt want to keep waiting. My fiance used to work in the food business and said there is no reason to wait over an hour for food. I wouldnt go back after our experience.</Text>

Got seated immediately, but sat there with my wife and daughter for 15 minutes and not a single person helped us. They didn't ask for a drink order or anything. People got seated next to us and helped instantly. Will NEVER go back to this place again.</text>

While restaurant is good and servants are nice this Review is specifically for water.
They give you tap water that is rated at 485TDS.
Max EPA contamination level is at 500. So this is very contaminated.<//Review>

<Text>The bartenders could really use some smiles and better attitudes! They should also try picking there heads up so they can sell a few more rounds! That being said the food was great and always is but being in the service industry myself I will never accept the lack of service I received today!< /Text>< pics>

<review>Great location. Came for breakfast but should have gone to Tower Two. Coffee and fruit bowl were excellent. Everything else was sub par. Avoid the orange juice at all cost, you'd be better off sucking on lemons (which totally ruined the Mimosas). Most other food items were either over or under seasoned.</review><rate>2<//rate><userid>106220190635875620379< /userid>< Time>

<review>Honestly, the food was pretty good. But our service was mediocre and we had two Bloody Mary’s that costed $42 (and not anything fancy). All said and done, for a simple breakfast for two, our bill was $76. Felt ripped off.<//review><resp>None< /resp>< UserId.>

Great view of the ocean. Good stop for quick bites after a beach visit. Parking can be a challenge, but there is a garage under the building. When I was there, the bathroom had a huge leak in the ceiling. This place is usually very loud and crowded.</Text>

First night in San Diego. I placed my order alnost an hour and a half ago and have no received it yet. One person in our 10 person party got her food 45 minutes ago but nobody else in our group. I hopenthe food is good when it gets here, if it ever does, but even if it's the best food Ive ever had the service and speed is terrible.< /Text>

<Text>I love this place!!! The food and drinks are awsome. I love the restaurant's atmosphere and the staff is so fun and full of energy. I ordered the salmon dinner and fault of my own forgot to mention how I like my salmon cooked. They took it back with no charge and the Chef brought it out to me personally...I thought that was so cool!!! I got to meet the man who makes it happen, Chef Khoury...great guy and love his personality!!! Would most definitely go there again and will highly recommend this restaurant to others!!!!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

We came last week and we were very happy with the food and the service... We are here from Texas for a week so we decided to come in again and came at 8 when the webpage states that they open to find out that their holiday hours are different then what is posted. Then after waiting an hour to get the amazing crab cake Benedict they inform us the sauce won't  be done for another 45 minutes. Very disappointed with this experience!<//review>

The chef came out and  reassured us its all freshly prepared. I had today's market fish which was the most delectable halibut in a white sauce served with roasted root veggies  (baby zucchini, small squash) and a pan seared swiss chard that was the best I've ever had. Hubby had the hanger steak (a flank steak marinated to such tenderness), garlic mashed and some vegetables (I didn't see or try those ).  The bill came to $48 and I even had a $6 drink.  Deal of the century!!  Full-on gourmet that would have cost twice as much anywhere else (we even ate outside staring at the ocean) to complete the top-notch dining experience!!  Will so be back next time in Ocean Beach!!!

So the place looks amazing, right on the beach. But the food was a waste of money. I had a breakfast where the biscuit was like a brick, the sausage was also hard and bland... and the eggs were the only thing that didn't weight a ton.
And this worse than McDonald's breakfast cost me $15. I'm all for trend and so on but no thank you. There sister bar "wonderland" is amazing but after trying this once I am not a fan.<//Text>

My husband and I were there today specifically for the taste of a mail tai that we experienced the first time we ordered it. Oddly, we haven't been successful. He ordered it and I ordered the coconut version. Totally disappointed with the regular one; we were hoping third time's a charm. My coconut version was heavenly but I afraid to try it again. Ugh~ The cost of eating out, I guess.< /text>

And this worse than McDonald's breakfast cost me $15. I'm all for trend and so on but no thank you. There sister bar "wonderland" is amazing but after trying this once I am not a fan.<//Review><GmapID>0x80deaa3a4cd5c6e5:0x4a7106ced76f8d77<//GmapID></record>

Good food if a bit pricey with a great view of the ocean. I had fried cheese curds, which were delicious but a small portion for an appetizer.<//Text>

Update: Came back for brunch and, again, the food was fantastic. Carnitas Benny was awesome, with tender carnitas, awesome Ancho hollandaise sauce, and green chillies. The server, Catie, was great and the food came out quickly. The only issue was the hostess. Seemed like a chore for her to do her job and that she would rather finish her personal conversation with her coworker while we stood there instead of setting the table and seating us. Maybe the hosts don't get a portion of the tips? Anyway, a small hiccup, and still a 5 star experience.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Food is so so, they can't decide if they're a high end, small portions restaurant, a hipster spot, or a comfort food/tourist spot.  But, they're in such a popular location, they don't have to decide.

Their drinks, though, are like a tiki bar dream.  Great beer selection, delicious mai tai, some neat original, tropical cocktails.</text>< pictures>

I was told that back in the day, this was the place to be. It was somewhat dated, but not bad.  We sat upstairs and had some decent drinks, then went somewhere else.<//review>

<review>Food is so so, they can't decide if they're a high end, small portions restaurant, a hipster spot, or a comfort food/tourist spot.  But, they're in such a popular location, they don't have to decide.

Their drinks, though, are like a tiki bar dream.  Great beer selection, delicious mai tai, some neat original, tropical cocktails.< /review>< pics>

Inquired as to whether I could have the avocado toast without jalapenos, was told yes, came with jalapenos. They can't do it without, no biggie, but please don't give me the wrong answer. Nice view; patio could've used some tables.</Review>

What a bad experience i was on the bar for 1 hr abd the bartender keep ignoring me. It was not so busy for him to ignored me like that. I really feel the racial profile. i was the only latina in the bar. Im saying this because is not the first time i come here , i usually come here with my firends that happen to be caucasian so i thougth i can come here on my own. never again i really feel disrespected< /review>

Inquired as to whether I could have the avocado toast without jalapenos, was told yes, came with jalapenos. They can't do it without, no biggie, but please don't give me the wrong answer. Nice view; patio could've used some tables.< /Review>

Breakfast here is wonderful! The Carnitas Benedict and Sweet Potato hash are super tasty.. Lively, energetic atmosphere that matches well with the Sunday morning beach vibe. The staff was great. Very attentive and accommodating, especially Evan. She was more than pleasant. Very personablel, yet professional, offering wonderful suggestions.<//text>

Good food but EXTREMELY LONG wait. We waited 30 minutes to sit, waited another 20 at least to order, our food took at least an hour then the waitress took FOREVER to bring our check. We were visiting for the day and this stop took way to much of our time. They need to hire more staff.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) We used the OB Surf Lodge for a stop for a beer. Both draft beers did not taste good. A bit too bitter. Then there is quite a lot going on in the restaurant, because there is no alternative to go grooming food or drink nearby.
The table stuck oh why always. It was still interesting to sit in the front row behind the glass and watch the people and cars.

(Original)
Wir nutzten die OB Surf Lodge für einen Stop auf ein Bier. Beide gezapfte Biere schmeckten uns nicht. Eine zu bittere Note. Dann ist ganz schön los in dem Restaurant, denn es gibt in der Nähe keine Alternative etweder um gepflegt Essen oder Trinken zu gehen.
Der Tisch klebte wieso ach immer. Es war trotzdem interessant in der ersten Reihe hinter dem Glas zu sitzen und die Menschen und Autos zu beobachten.</text><Rate>4</Rate>< name>

Carne con verdure MOLTO buona, i miei amici anno preso hamburger e confermano di aver mangiato molto bene, complimenti anche per le birre ottime, l'unica pecca era la ragazza dietro il bancone sempre arrabbiata, aveva una faccia molto nervosa.
