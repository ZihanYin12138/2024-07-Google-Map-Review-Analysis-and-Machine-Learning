This is a very comfortable hotel with all the necessities and a few niceties. I had a room on the second floor with a wood surfaced cathedral ceiling and a fireplace and a shared balcony. It was very comfortable and very clean. It is perfectly located; Old Fisherman’s Wharf is within walking distance, as is downtown Monterey and restaurants and coffee shops. Also convenient to many attractions by car.  Worth a return visit.< /Text>

Merritt House Inn was super cute, quaint, and more affordable than the big-name hotel across the street. The bed was comfortable and my second floor room was generally quiet--I was never bothered by hearing guests in other rooms. Both front desk people I interacted with were friendly and helpful. The only things I didn't like about the stay were that it was a bit dark in the area at night (I was on foot for the duration of my stay and a little more lighting, particularly at the entrance to the hotel off the street, would've been nice), and the wifi was pretty slow. Still, I would happily stay here again.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtunYsxqNTQCX86a7x_MfwiGjsz7qUuXA-zXoH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWsgrNko48T-j5QKHlpawQ4QkmIQui6nuSBoE8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808de423d34a890d:0xfe18fc122396f400< /gmapID></record>

<text>This hotel is a little gem! The room was absolutely charming, with a fireplace and french doors to a little veranda overlooking the garden. Parking was $10 but right onsight and made it so easy. We walked to the wharf and Cannery Row. Great locaiton.What a delight!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The walls are paper thin so we heard loud speaking neighbors well after midnight. We asked for more towels. They were not delivered to our room, but left on the dirty floor of the outside walkway. Coffee not ready at 9:00. The guy making it apologized and explained he arrived at work at 9:15. "Breakfast" is small factory-made pastries wrapped in cellophane like those sold at 9-11   stores. When we checked out, desk clerk did not say "thank you" or offer any other expression of gratitude for our business.< /Text>

Parking is very tight here, so chances are if you check in late or went out for dinner, you may not be able to find a spot. Good things are there are so many restaurants around the area.

This is the first time I stayed in a room without a window. The only way you can some air inside is to leave the front door open! Really! To compensate for this at least an A/C is necessary like so many hotels without window opening. The bathroom was renovated and was clean. The standing  shower did not have a place to put your shampoo or soap. So I had to toss the soap on the shower floor before I could leave to dry myself. If you're okay with stuffy no fresh air room all night then this is a good deal compare to other inns.<//Review>

<review>Very cozy room in walking distance of many restaurants and shops. Owner and staff did an excellent job taking precautions given the COVID pandemic. They even threw in free pastries and fruit since continental breakfasts couldn't be provided due to stricter sanitary measures. An overall excellent experience; will definitely book again when we're back in Monterey!<//review>< Pics>

No A/C, which is often not an issue in the Monterey area, but also no air circulation with leaving our ground floor doors ajar. No in room telephones, making it necessary to walk to the office for needs, etc.  Very pleasant staff.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Fantastic! Loved this little hotel. Quaint decor and spacious rooms within ideal walking distance to all the activities near Cannery Row, the pier, and Alvarado Street. Its also immediately adjacent to a small neighborhood market! Great place to walk over to get some cheese and crackers to pair with some wine on the balcony. 10/10 would visit again.< /Text>< pics>

The room is like a prison cell we have no feeling of vacation while staying here.  The agency chanced me extra for breakfast, but they said they don't serve breakfast due to COVID-19.  No room service because they forgot.  And they never fix their ice machine.  We will be back to Monterey soon, but will never stay here ever again.</Review>< GmapID>

This place is a rip off for stealing my money they basically kept my money after i cancelled  158 dollars for nothing i understand that they have a policy but it shouldn't  have to be a complete day stay that's insane and specially during this pandemic time and the reason why i couldn't make it was cause of COVID 19 exposure at work so had to go get tested and u think they carried hell no . It's so easy just to take someone hard working money right. Never go here< /review>

<Text>This hotel was the right price, it was close to everything we came to see, and the grounds were lovely.

There is also no air conditioning, and the beds are not comfortable. Normally, the lack of A/C wouldn’t be a big deal, but the weather was really warm when we were in town. The mattress would be bad no matter the time of year or the weather.< /Text>< Pictures>

Fairly gross.  First impression was the almost dead rat gasping it’s last breath on the walkway next to the check in desk.  Paper thin walls did provide some entertainment value as we were able to hear every detail of the couple in the next room who were apparently enjoying themselves numerous times through the night.  This hotel was clever enough to have a 48 hour cancellation policy.  Which meant there was no way to cancel any of our 3 nights booked for a refund.  We left early with our unpaid room sitting empty.  When I told the clerk we were checking out early he didn’t ask what was wrong or for any explanation.  Here merely said “I’m not surprised”.  That summed up the experience perfectly.<//review>

The location was great, the site was pretty and the room was spacious.  The bed was quite comfortable as well.  Breakfast was disappointing - everything was cold food and there was no variety or effort put into it by staff.  I wanted a brochure that they were out of and no effort was spent to help me find the information in another way.  That kind of stuff: minimal inn keeper involvement.</Text>

Appeared to be a cute, quaint little inn but it is a bit run down and needs some work. Walls are very thin and our bathroom had mold and some plaster appeared that it might not last through a full shower. Staff was kind and garden was cute. Also the patio is entirely joint limiting privacy.<//text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Great location in the city. So many shops and restaurants within walking distance. If you're a guest parking is free which is key bc street parking is limited and mostly metered. The room is adorable. Almost like a mini apartment. Very spacious with a large vanity area. It is right next to a market/liquor store and the first night we were woken up by loud music coming from a vehicle we are guessing was parked in the liquor store parking lot. Not the fault of the inn though. Would Definitely recommend and stay here again.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Very nice.  When we checked in the host was very hospitable and accommodating.  Unfortunately we were only able to stay one night.We hadnt been to Monterey in quite a few years, and back then we stayed at the Merritt House.  Wrote down the name to make sure wouldnt forget.  We didnt, and stayed there last weekend.< /Text>

The Merritt House Inn was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to help us. I was in a two queen beds room. It was decorated with a golf theme. There was an abundance of pillows and towels. There was a fan in the room as well as a TV, alarm clock, and coffee maker. There was a mini fridge under the sink in the bathroom that was empty and just there for us to use. The location of this hotel is very convenient. We were able to walk to lots of different restaurants and sites.</text>

<text>I stayed here for two nights, and was happy I did.  There is a pretty garden area right outside the rooms, the staff is friendly and accommodating, and the rooms are unique- I got the "shabby chic" room.  Breakfast is 8-10am, and includes fruit, hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereal, pastries, coffee, and OJ in a dining room area.  My bathroom was pretty small and bare-bones, but my room was huge and included a fireplace and a patio area.  This isn't a big, corporate hotel, so if you want a 3am check-out or fancy amenities, I'd recommend going somewhere else.  If you want a cute room right near the center of town and walkable to Fisherman's Wharf, I'd recommend this place.< /text>< GmapID>

We enjoyed our room, the friendly staff, the great breakfast (quick & easy), and the location in walking distance to town.  Jason went the extra mile on three different occasions for individuals in our group that I know of including myself.  He was awesome!  The rest of the staff was also a delight!< /Text>< Pics>

Rooms are very clean and comfortable.  Location is exceptional.  Parking very tight and breakfast is minimal.  However, would use again due to cleanliness and location.  Spent 8 days at the Inn.<//Text>

It was a really nice, older place, off the beaten path, but really close to all attractions (within walking distance for sure).  The continental breakfast was excellent.  The beds were really comfortable.  Our room had a fireplace and a sky light.  Decorations very cozy.  I was very impressed and would definately go again.<//Review>

The Merritt House is the best. Our room was clean with no odor, nicely decorated without being pretentious, quiet, conveniently located in downtown Monterey, had a nice breakfast and dining room, the personnel were attentive and pleasant, and I'll try to stay there again. I got extra hotel points for arranging this stay.<//text>

Our stay was comfortable and the physical location was preferred, as it was close to downtown and the ocean. Watch out if you have a large vehicle because the parking lot/structure is very tight. Also, the room was very stuffy and had no air flow or AC/fans. This made sleep uncomfortable. Staff were friendly, breakfast was well rounded. Bed and bedding were A+++<//text>

<text>Wonderful place to stay close to Fishemans Wharf and downtown area. A short drive to the Aquarium and Cannery Row. We were there after the 3 day Memorial Day Weekend and had the place to ourselves, almost. There are 25 or 26 rooms that are very comfortable with beautiful furnishings. Parking can be tight if they are full, but every room has 1 space alloted...just beware if you have a huge vehicle, there are a limited number of spaces where you can fit.<//text>< resp>

<pics>None< /pics><text>The Merritt House Inn was reasonably priced compared to the surrounding big name hotels. We had a second floor room and the vaulted ceiling made the room feel very spacious. The walls are a bit thin, we could hear the neighbors tv. Definitely an older establishment but very well maintained. The complimentary breakfast started at 8, not the best for early risers. The selection was also a bit limited. The room did have a fridge so we were able to store our own food. The only complaint was the heating/cooling in the room. We could never find that just right spot. Parking is free but also a first come first serve basis. The location was perfect. A few blocks to Old Fisherman's Wharf and about a mile to Cannery Row. Alvarado Strert was a few blocks away and has many restaurants to choose from.</text><Gmap_id>0x808de423d34a890d:0xfe18fc122396f400</Gmap_id>< userid>

<text>The rooms are very nice and well kept. The decor is decent for the area. The price is also not all that bad. The only reason that I have a problem with the location is the noise. The road is very close and the sound of cars is non stop and even if you close all the doors and windows it is still loud enough to wake you up very early in the morning.<//text><date>1446004103223</date>< Pictures>

Nice proximity to the cool features of Monterey.  You can walk or take a trolley to all the sites. Mattresses could be better.  They also seem to have some birds nesting in the back and they can be noisy.</Review>

I was very disappointed staying in room 12. There was severe water damage. When I asked at the front desk about it , they said I was one of three guest that have questioned it in 2 years. Then why not fix it? The front desk said they have tested for Black mold and it didn’t present. Then why not fix it??? It was gross!i would post a picture if possible:(</Review>

Great location within walking distance to the main drag and the wharf etc. Comfortable, clean and friendly. Free onsite parking is extremely convenient.</review>

It was cozy. They had a fireplace but you had to request the fire log. It was overpriced. But if they lowered the prices id stay there again<//Text>

Rooms are clean and near restaurants and shops. No coffeemaker, no microwave. Bathrooms are old and smelly, only one small mirror with flickering overhead lights. The decor is all about golfing and in poor taste, poorly displayed and seriously outdated. Only one room key and parking is terrible, basically 1st come 1st serve, otherwise you have to park several streets over. I would only stay there again if nothing else was available. I don’t recommend this place to anyone. At $200 a night I expect more for my money. Mattress are hard, just like sleeping on the floor.<//Text>

terrible. Room was outdated, bathroom sink broken, no counter space, bad lighting and mirror. Room was hot. No room directories for phone or facilities. Their was a ceiling fan, and a stand up fan. Should of had A/C at those prices. Some weird typed code with 12 numbers & letters for the tv or wifi???? I was soo tired even trying to figure it out was ridiculous, No menu guide on the remote control so I had to blind search with no screen info as well.  Bed was hard. Continental Breakfast was cheap. Pastries look like the $5 Bargain from Safeway with their brand name yogurt. Too many breads. But no toast for toaster. Had to ask for OJ. Apples were old, and Oranges didn't look much better. The worst. The old woman with blonde hair who never acknowledge me at all. Looked, spoke, or acted friendly. Too busy talking on her cell phone in the breakfast room, but did stop to look at the tv for weather.  She was angry and I felt very discriminated so I packed my bags and left well before the check out time.  In fact, this same woman was the one I expressed my disappointment too. She never apologized, looked at me, kept wiping the counter, and mocked everything I said to her like a child. I've been in Sales Mgmt all my life, and this is the worst experience I've ever had. Over priced, old, and unfriendly. I'm posting on every site my awful experience. Charges being disputed. First impression is a lasting impression. TERRIBLE</Review>

He took apart our front door lock that has been very hard to lock and unlock. Due to his familiarity with the manufacture of our lock he recommended I contact them for a new inner trim instead of purchasing a whole new lock and handle (this will save me a lot of money... Thank you Joe!). He also made several keys for our doors, changed a deadbolt lock to match the rest of the house as well as serviced all of our deadbolts that were sticking from lack of use. He was at our home for over an hour and was very pleasant. Any reviews that say otherwise must not be actual customers or they called the wrong number. I highly recommend him and will definitely use him again in the future.</Review>

He explained everything to me so I understood how it all worked. He saved me so much money because I was considering buying all new knobs and locks ,, he was very kind and answered all my questions patiently and with great detail, I’m so pleased with his work, he even made my keys work better than they ever had before! I’ll recommend him to anyone! If I ever need a lock smith he is who I would call. He was recommended to me by another company who was booked out so long and I didn’t want to wait. Joe fit me in right away and worked with my schedule, he was great!!</review><Date>1582984204120<//Date>< UserId.>

Joes came within the hour to help us get a guest out of our bathroom. He was able to free them and replaced the lock in speedy time. I appreciated him coming so quickly on short notice as well as telling us what went wrong. He was able to give me an estimate on future work as well. He was affordable and quick!< /review>

I used Joes locksmith and the job was done proficiently. I find Joes locksmith to be affordable, honest and skilled. I recommend them to all looking for a locksmith.

I find the review listed by Dillon below rude offensive and unprofessional.
This review belongs in the gutter just like the garbage posting the review.
Dillon keep your nasty remarks to yourself, you are obviously not a nice person.</review>

When I got back in town I went to Joe's to pick up my car key  I was blown away that Joe was able to make my car key off a picture and the price was really reasonable  Joe is really awesome and will only be using

Joe came out in the 105 degree temps to do our chipped automobile key replacement. When he got here, he had to cope with an ignition practically torn out of the car, dead battery, numerous obstacles just to get to the programming of a new chip! I’m so grateful he has a lot of patience. Price for his service was very reasonable. Such a pleasant experience!! Thank you so much from both my son and myself. You’re the best!<//text>

on a day he should have had his phone turned off, Joe showed up and gave me the red carpet treatment.
got my car back to me and honestly made a bad situation turn to a welcome moment.
thanks Joe for being a great and professional
technician and giving me your time on this day.
i hope i never need a locksmith again
but if i do, hes the ONLY one I'll call

So professional and helpful.  I had locked my car keys in a bedroom and needed to be somewhere soon.  In minutes after I called, he was here with a smile on his face.  At first the situation didn't look good for the lock, and I thought I'd have to replace the whole thing.  He opened up his magic toolkit and started trying a few different approaches.  Before I knew it, he got the door opened without any damage to the lock, door, or frame.  This guy is good.  Really good.

He quickly explained to me how the door's lock worked, and how he had been able to get it open, so I got a nice little lesson out of it all too.

The pen I signed the paperwork with ended up being a holiday gift that I was able to keep, with a little poem on it!  I definitely recommend his services.< /Text>

I wound up not using this locksmith because when I called, the person who answered was rude and kept sighing whenever i asked a question and was snappy and short with me. The rates were comparable to most of the other locksmiths so I absolutely wouldn't use this one if I have the choice.</Text>

Read other reviews and was hesitant. Joe is old school and probably not the best communicator over the phone all he said was text me your address and that was it. He was here within 30 minutes and got me into my garage within minutes. His computer was down so he wasn't able to make me a key on site but said he would do so as soon as he got home and didn't charge me for his services until, I am assuming, he is able to make a key for me. Joe was knowledgeable,  polite, professional and will save you a lot of money. I would recommend.< /text>

<review>Just called to ask a question and i have never spoken to someone as rude as this. He was asking me questions and using words that are known to him but not commonly used. Then proceeds to huff and puff because i didnt understand his reference. Then proceeds to be like yeah like what i was describing to you! Wow how rude. Like couldnt you have used lament terms???? Like seriously? Thats not how your supposed to talk to a customer! Then he told me the price. when i tried to mention my dealership would do it cheaper, he rudely cuts me off saying that oh thats a lie they are just going to steal ur money and thats what they tell you to get you there then screw you later. Like? Um can i finish my sentence before you bite my head off? Just wow. I would hate to see what his service is like if its anything like his rude disrespectful attitude. Smdh.😠< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Just called him and was given a nasty attitude before I could even ask about his services and prices. It sounded like he was drunk so I already knew I would not be giving him my business. I then just said I must have the wrong number but before I could finish sentence he said something about “you don’t know the difference between asking and finding a locksmith” then hung up on me!! I can’t imagine how anyone would get great service from such a rude man!< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_name>

I locked my keys in the trunk of the car 2000 Honda accord & I needed a locksmith to unlock the trunk latch Joe came immediately. It turned out my keys weren't in there so he made a master key right on the spot didn't take long at all. Good quality service. Fast & Friendly. I called around & Joe had the best price. Highly recommend his services.< /review>

Called and asked for service. Just like others have mentioned, guy sounded disgruntled from the start. I explained my problem with a lock and he said ok text the address and he'll come out. I texted the address and after over an hour called to get an e.t.a. Guy said the address I gave didn't show up on navigation, but he didn't care to text/call back and let me know he wasn't coming or ask for directions. Poor customer service, should've listened to other's reviews.<//Review>

<Text>I accidentally locked myself out of my house when I took my 2-year old to the park for the morning. I realized at the park I didn't have my house key and looked up locksmiths on my iPhone. Joe's was the first one that popped up. On the way home I called Joe's and when I got to my driveway Joe's was already there. So within 5 minutes someone was there to let me in my house which was awesome considering I had a 2 year old who was hungry.

I would definitely recommend Joe's! It was fast, friendly, and so easy. Hopefully I don't lock myself out of my house again, but if I do, I'm calling Joe's! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!< /Text>< Time>

THANK YOU Joe's Lock & Key.  Lost the keys to my motorhome (which I was trying to show to a buyer) and my brother had just met Joe the day before and had got his card.  How lucky !!!

I called and he came right out.   Needed to replace ignition switch, but did it promptly and expertly.  The repair works perfectly and the cost was VERY reasonable.  I recommend this service to everyone !!!!   You never know when you might need help, but if you do, CALL JOE'S !!!!   YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!!< /review>

I locked my keys in my car, ignition on and my son was in his carseat! I googled the closest locksmith and Joe came up. When I called, he said it would maybe take 30-45 min according to traffic. I explained that my car was on and my child was in it! He arrived within 15 minutes! He was quick to unlock the doors and his major concern was my child! He was very friendly to myself and my son, even giving my son a flashlight. I highly recommend this company! Thank you so much</review>

Joe gave me some of the best service I've Had with a small business. He was more than friendly and showed off his experience working on car locks and gave me a good laugh through his speedy service! He Rekeyed my truck as well as the lock on my Campershell on the back of my truck very quickly. If I ever need a locksmith I won't call anyone else. Highly Recommend<//text>

Called on behalf of my friend giving me a ride home from work to check prices because she locked her keys in her trunk and was freaking out. Guy who answered was flat out rude and unprofessional. I didn’t tell him I wanted him to come out to help us, I was simply calling to ask his price rates. Here’s the thing, if you’ve never had to call a locksmith before, you don’t know what information they need. They know what they need because that’s THEIR job, potential  customers don’t.

If I quickly explain I’m calling for my friend who locked her keys in her trunk, wants to know what they’ll charge her, and you ask me, “trunk of what” with an ugly attitude,  I’m going to answer “of a car” sarcastically because 1) I don’t know that I need to specify the make and model of that car since I’ve never called this type of business before and 2) I never confirmed I wanted your business in the first place,  I clearly stated I’m just calling for a price. If the rates are different based upon what kind of vehicle you have, all he had to do was explain the prices are different depending on what type of car it is and clearly specify what he needed to know instead of being vague, not talk to me like I’m incapable of understanding him because I’m a female.

Based on reviews, I guess the way this person treats you depends on if he’s gotten enough sleep putting him in a good mood or if you have a big job he can overcharge for that makes it worth helping you out.< /Text>

Thank you Joe.  We had a rental property that needed the locks changed out immediately and he met me at my property at the time that worked for me and took care of everything. His pricing was very reasonable and he was very professional. We will definitely be calling you next time we need anything.</Text>

I had an intermittent ignition switch on my Dodge truck.  Sometimes it would not turn. This frequently happened in inconvenient places, like away from home and when in a hurry.  I had put off repair because of the cost of replacing with a new switch.

Finally decided enough was enough and called Joe.  He surprised me by rebuilding the switch rather than replacing it thus saving me significant money.  Now it is like new and I am a happy camper.

Great service!!  Will call him again when the  need arises.<//text>

Awesome service.  Literally arrived 5 minutes after we got off the phone.  I told him what I needed and he told me what he recommended and we went with that.  Couldn't have asked for better.  Will definitely recommend to others.</review>

<Text>I googled locksmith when visiting Bakersfield.  Joe's came up.  While Joe was busy on a run and couldn't help me he suggested I go to Snider's.  They were very helpful and cut the unusual key I was needing.  I always love it when a place that can't help you has a suggestion of where you can get help.  That tells me they are good and know the others in the area where they'd suggest you go.  Thanks Joe!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

I locked my keys in my Honda Civic. I gave call and the guy was really rude to me and made me feel stupid. all i wanted was help! he tried charging me 65 dollars and said he will arrive within a hour. I'm glad i found Bakersfield Mobile Locksmith, they gave me better customer service and arrived in 10 mins plus for a better price of 45 dollars. JOE'S LOCK AND KEY YOU SUCK!!!</Text>

Very rude. I called to get an estimate and was hung up on. Maybe he was upset because I couldn't book an appointment right then and there. I told him I was a school teacher an had to work out my availability before I could book a date and time. I guess I'll be taking my business elsewhere.< /text>

Oh my. The business is listed as 24/7 however when I call on a Saturday at 3pm for an estime the response was-
"Yeah, I don't do that on the weekends." Before he simply hung up without another word. He couldn't be bothered apparently.<//Review>

Horrible service. Called to ask for assistance. As I began to explain my situation he cut me off, said he was done for the day and hung up on me. I was in need of help and he responded rudely and hung up on me. Don’t waste your time on unprofessional people who falsely advertise 24 hours. Don’t bother with these jerks!<//review>

<time>1434732275526<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I needed to have 7 locks rekeyed and/or installed at my residence.  I have not had great experiences with locksmiths in the past and apprehensive of the process in general but it was a necessity.  I started off by calling several other locksmiths.  Most did not even return my call.  One made an appointment and never showed.  I gave Joe’s a ring and someone actually answered the phone.  I asked about pricing and when they could come out.  I was told that there is a call out fee and then a price per lock.  They were able to come out that afternoon, just 30 minutes after I called.  The locksmith and his apprentice arrived promptly.  They were polite, clean and professional.  I showed them where all the locks were and they set out to get them fixed.  They worked very quickly and were done in less than an hour.

Once I received the bill though, I was not quite as satisfied…

First, I provided a set of brand new locks to be installed in one door in order for the handles to match the rest of the house.  I admit, I should have asked more questions.  When talking to the other locksmith (that stood me up), he said that it would be the same cost to install, as it is to rekey, since it is essentially the same work.  And, he also suggested he rekey it because locks from Big Box stores are keyed too commonly (again for the same fee).  That is not how Joe’s handled it.  Instead of uniquely keying all three doors (new locks included), they just rekeyed the other two doors to match the new lock (lazy in my opinion) and on top of it charged MORE for the installation (compared to just a rekey).  Now tell me why would an installation of a lock (literally unscrewing the old one and screwing in the new one) cost more than rekeying a lock (which requires removal, keying and reinstallation)?  And then insult to injury, after they left I noticed that the striker plates were not changed out either.  So, now I have brass striker plates and satin nickel handles.  They did not leave me any accessories that came with the lock (striker plates, wrench to remove handles and the “smart key”).  And even better, they installed the lever handle upside down.  Luckily, I had a wrench from another handle I personally replaced and was able to correct that mistake.

Secondly, the bill included a fee for labor.  That was never specified when I asked about cost in the initial phone conversation.  I was told there was a call out fee and price per lock.  I was billed for a call out fee, price per lock AND labor.  This should have been disclosed when I asked!

Overall, they answer the phone, get there quick and get the job done.  You are just going to pay a premium…and a labor fee.

Update:  The owner called me to “discuss” my problems which devolved into an argument over details…what happened to the customer is always right?  After he insisted that he didn’t know what his apprentice was doing because he was busy working on other things and questioned if I had looked in my trash can for the missing pieces, I ended the conversation.  Sir, I paid you WAY too much money for the solution to be ME digging through my trash can to fix your employee's mistake.  Be careful what you ask for because this review was written at your adamant request.  Sorry if you don’t like the truth.  And after that phone call, I will revoke my vote of professionalism too.</text>< pictures>

<Review>I lost my keys to my RV trailer.  I took the lock off and brought it to him.  He said it would be cheaper to just replace the entire lock.  Told me where to get a replacement and set it up so I got his cost at the RV parts store...which is about half of MSRP.  He didn't charge me a dime.  He did come off a little gruff to begin with but became friendly enough towards the end.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Joe was incredibly easy to work with. Extremely nice and very patient with me. I had a sheriff lockout where I had to, unfortunately, Evict a tenant who hadn’t paid over a year. A job that should’ve only taken an hour ended up taking almost three due to a lot of hurdles in the way. I unfortunately didn’t have the key to the building Bruce’s the locks were switched to different locks and the front door key I had difficulty finding. I’m not a person who likes to make things difficult for other people. I feel guilty for putting more work on someone than I have to and joe and Joe made it seem perfectly fine and told me not to worry and it happens all the time. Also the AC in the building wasn’t working so it was hot and at the end of it he was still smiling and joking with me (if it were me I would be irritated). Not only was he nice and made me feel comfortable, he was also super helpful and educated me on the type of locks put in and recommended better locks for when I renovate the building.

This is my go to mom and pop shop for my fish tank! They have healthy looking fish in very clean tanks, and a very good variety. All my fish are from this place, and are healthy and happy. I purchased African cichlid fish today, and I am so pleased with my purchase. Prices are very good, and they have the best customer service. The lady who works there was very helpful with me today, she was patient and really knows her stuff about different fish! I get all my stuff from here, definitely worth your time.< /review>

I shop here at least once a week, great mom and pop store with great service. Definitely the cleanest aquarium in LA,  owners know the fish they’re selling and tell you whether it’s good or bad for your tank. They care about customer relations more than just your money.</Text>

Totally recommend this place.

I'm gonna be simple and straightforward.. staff needs more knowledge about the product (fish) they sell , not all fish are the same, please help your costumers find the right fish for them, don't sell a fish just for selling it educated your customers on what fish is right for them, customers will appreciate it instead of re-homing there fish later.</text>

Tokyo Aquarium is a small, but fun place.  It has enough kinds of fish to keep you entertained. My favorite part was the jelly fish tank which changes colors and most of all the fish tank tunnel! It was really cool to get a view of the different fishes going through the tunnel. It's the only aquarium I've been to with that long of a tunnel. This is a great place to go locally if you want to see the fishes.<//Text>

<text>Nice and clean with good flow for crowds. Admission is a bit steep for the experience but I was willing to pay it. The size of the facility is smaller than you'd expect, but if you have small children, it's perfect because their attention span doesn't last long anyway. Close enough to all the shops/restaurants at the pier. Park across the street in the garage and check your parking receipt for aquarium discounts. All in all, a fun experience for all.</text>< userid>

<review>This is a wonderful aquarium!! Spent more than five hours. Great place to bring kids of any age. Also they have a cafe, gift shops, and also check their website for special nights where they sell gourmet tapas and wine/beer with live music band. It is a wonderful place and can't wait to return! Also use your student or corporate discounts to save about $15 per adult ticket.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>We stayed overnight for a Cub Scout event. My 9 year old son really enjoyed it.  The staff is very knowledgeable and really like what they do. We stayed in the jelly fish room--I'm telling you, staring at those jellies all night is like being on hallucinogens (not that I would know what those are really like). There is a huge shark and some big sea bass. The octopuses are very cool.<//review>< user_id>

Great experience at this shop again. Both people that helped me were very helpful. Was at 2 other fish shops before here and the quality of the fish here was way better than the other 2 not only on variety but quality  and healthy looking fish as well</Review>

Pretty good experience. Smaller than I was expecting compared to other aquariums but the tunnel aquarium was pretty neat on how long it was. Good to do if you're down by the pier and looking for something to do. Good they promote healthy water and how to conserve/save the ocean and its animals.</text>

<text>Really cool!  When I was there they had a meet the blue tongue skink and shark/ray feeding so that was cool to see. I really loved the shark/ray/fish tunnels. It's so cool and they're so big!  Feels like you can touch them!  It's a good time for adults and kids.< /text><Date>1597636732903< /Date>< user_name>

As soon as I entered, I noticed the pacman frogs were in little cups that were dirty and sit there for who knows how long. Aside from that, there was dirty aquarium tanks with dead fish. Customer service was not friendly. I would have purchased and rescued a few pacman frogs, but that would only make the owner want to buy more and replace the ones I grabbed.<//Text>

{'time': 1615429354609, 'text': 'Hello Cesar Aranda. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Appreciate your feedback. We bought them about a week ago. Since you know so much about amphibians I am sure you know that they don\'t live in crystal clear water in lagoons, creeks, and ponds, rather all the water in those areas are quite dirty. It is actually not good to replace all the water with LA\'s tap water even if it\'s treated because of its high chlorine content. We change the water daily but due to the small amount the water gets dirty daily as well.\n\nAlso, there are numerous clients who ask for our "dirty" water because of its high bacteria content which lowers a number of toxins deadly to fish and amphibians alike. Please do your research before you talk about dirty water. All frogs live in dirty water.\n\nAlso take this as a warning. We never gave you permission to take photographs inside our establishment. You were in private property. Please read the law below.\n\n"When you are on private property, the property owner may set rules about the taking of photographs.\xa0If you disobey the property owner\'s rules, they can order you off their property (and have you arrested for trespassing if you do not comply)"'}< /Response>

Took my son, hubby, brother in law and kids here on a Saturday morning. I had bought discounted tickets on TravelZoo, $9 each and my son is under age 3, so he was free. The aquarium is small, but huge to our toddler! He loved it! The sting rays and turtles were his faves. I think the regular price $18 each is way too high, but I would definetely return for the discounted price. I was very happy we went early. It wasnt crowded and we could walk at our own pace, letting the kids enjoy it all!</review>

Aquarium of the Bay is the best place where you should go with your child. I paid about $20-$25 and I was really surprised how big is it. We went through the different room, corridors looking for a lot of fishes. I have never seen such a variety of species. Mostly, I liked the tuna fish, because it is so big and fabulous. The gift shop has some overpriced items so I could not afford to buy anything for my daughter. We spent about 3-4 hours.<//text>

Owner, didn't grab his name, super cool guy. Knows exactly what he's talking about. Helped group the right fish together in 2 different fish tanks I was buying for. Definitely going back.
Oh and the selection of fish.... MASSIVE! different sizes, different breeds, and both aggressive and peaceful fish.
ONLY freshwater fish, no salt water fish.< /Review>

Aquarium is not big but it's very neat - the underwater tunnels are great, touching pools are fun and the newly opened otter exhibit is great. Jellyfish tanks were my favorite!  I got discounted tickets through Groupon and I feel like paying the full price would be kind of a lot.< /text>

<Review>Large fish store with some parking in the back. They are located on a corner with a huge sign, you can't miss it.

This store carries practically anything and everything you might need for your aquarium and more. They even have bird and hamster feed.

Inside half if the store is a huge selection of fishes, snails, and shrimp, all very well priced. They also carry common aquatic plants. The place itself wasnt super clean, but to be expected with so many fishes. We came on a weekend and the store was very busy, even with 3 people working. However, they were very quick to help each and every customer who comes in. We ended purchasing a pearl scale. He seemed healthy enough, but the water he came with was very yellow.

Not sure if it was because they were so busy, but we were handed our chosen fish and that was the end of the transaction. We're still new fish owners so a little advice on how to acclimate the little guy would have appreciated, although not completely necessary.

Overall, a nice place to get fishes, but not my favorite in town.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmapID>

<Text>It's a non profit aquarium so it's very small. I think its worth the $25. Therr are a lot of educational talks during the day and feedings. You get to support the aquarium and get to walk around the tunnel.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

After my first visit to Tokyo Aquarium, (Los Angeles, CA) I will never purchase fish from the big box stores again. The kids that are hired are unreliable, uneducated and down right rude. The owner here at Tokyo Aquarium, (Dan I believe) is knowledgeable and extremely nice and helpful. I will definitely do business here again.</text>

I'm from the Bay Area but this was my 1st visit to the Aquarium of the Bay. If you haven't been, it's definitely worth the trip! But it's pricey & small...hence the four stars.< /Text>

I can't believe I didn't know this place was here! I stopped by yesterday to get some things for our new betta, who is struggling with some persistent swim bladder issues (NEVER get a fish from a big box store). They were so friendly and knowledgeable, and prices are comparable to any big box store nearby. I couldn't imagine getting another fish from a big box store with this place so close to me. Definitely check this place out not only for their service, but also to check out their impressive tanks.< /review><resp>{'time': 1589313193609, 'text': 'Thank you Megan for walking 30 minutes to visit us!

It is true that English is their second language but to this day they have set up thousands of aquariums with the same language skills for our clients and yes we were not perfect in getting all of them to our clients expectations but almost all have been successful.

We have grandparents who came as children.\n\nPlease let us know what items you find pricey and where you found lower prices in comparable stores.  We compare our prices to big department stores and as a small business, it is difficult for us to match items they order in bulk (i.e. supplies, etc., etc.).  We are, however, very confident in our livestock prices as most prices are even, if not better."}<//Response>

Good food. I tried something new - the Double Protein Avocado bowl. They're still very "old school" with their service...lots of yelling and lots of noise in the kitchen!<//Text>

< Review>
Oh my this facility was pretty dirty despite the food was pretty good it was just a little uncomfortable. It's sad when you walk into a restaurant and have to ask if you could have a towel to clean your own table and have a snitty employee reply "Well were under staff RIGHT NOW and storm off" Wow excuse me I'm only helping to PAY YOUR PAY CHECK!!!!< /Review>

< Review>
Messy, dirty, filthy. Trash on the floor, in the dining area, on the tables. There's trash  literally in front of the register that the employees can see but don't bother picking up. The kitchen is absolutely messy (picture below). The condiment area is dirty. Only one employee behind the counter struggling with taking orders and serving. The management seems to not care about cleanliness,  fast and friendly service, and the employees. The worst El Pollo Loco I've ever been to.< /Review>

My first time at this location as soon as I walked up I was greeted. The cashier gentleman was very nice and also suggested certain things on the menu which I eventually ended up ordering. Only thing that I wasn't too happy about was the chicken pieces were super tiny. Food was good, restaurant was super clean that was a plus and restrooms also.</text>

My experience not so good The cashier was more interesting goofing around with his coworkers I was standing in front of the cashier waiting for him to take my order he didn't even bother to see if were any customers standing in front of the cashier . He takes my order finally I told him I wanted juicy not burn chicken And when I get my order dried burnt chicken.
I think this place they lack of people skill they goof around too much And there need to get it together.< /Text>

<review>After working for 4 hours contributing to society all I wanted was 2 bean cheese burritos. Instead they gave me 1 burrito, and gave me an everything burrito. It was so bad I couldn’t even salvage it. They screwed up my coworkers order too .

I had a problem with this location.. the restaurant doesn't have signs to enter towards the counter.. The cashier was clueless.. The coupon I used needed me to spend an extra 40 cents..I lost my points after having to repay and re ring everything up.. And it was all too spicy.. And no consideration for handicapped people other than the parking space< /review>

<review>Always fast service when I come here. I usually in and out, because the team is efficient at this location. They've got great food and my favorites are their pinto beans and their big taco salad bowl (tostada salads) are absolutely delicious. The nice thing about this location too is that they have plenty of parking, because sometimes it can be a pain to find parking at other restaurants but this location has a huge lot. Plus they've got plenty of seating inside so I always find a spot. And you gotta love their salsa bar, because it's full of flavors to try and unlimited salsas, haha. Just don't be one of those people that takes up the whole salad bar for 10 minutes, that happens more than you'd expect, smh.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
If you're in search of some good old finger licking flame broiled chicken, El Pollo Loco is the place to be. Their chicken is quite delicious with numerous tasty side dishes. And for those of you who like salads, guess what... They have those as well. The staff often prepares it in similar fashion as that of a home cooked meal. If you're not in the mood for burgers and fries, go check them out. You won't regret it!< /Review>

<review>Horrible customer service by ANGELA V,  has a very bad attitude,  came up to the counter to order and the first words that came out of her mouth "WHAT" ...extremely trashy. Who hired this individual?  Is this how you train your staff?   Never been to any place that a staff member greets you by saying "WHAT" with a horrible attitude.  What a disgrace.  Big thumbs down to this location. Not even 1 star  very disturbing .<//review>< user_name>

<username>MARIEL i</username><Text>Today we went to Pollo Loco at this location in Burbank, around 4:15, and the person (I think he was the manager or supervisor because his shirt looked a little different) who took our order was very rude and didn't even add shrimp on my Chicken & Shrimp tostada but he DID charge for it. The thing is, we took the order to go so I didn't check right there. My mom asked if she could have 5 containers to add guacamole and salsa and he said he only had 2 left. Then she asked if they didn't have more and he said no, rudely (I guess because he had already said that they were only 2 left) But who the hell only has 2 containers left when you have more than 2 customers throughout the day?? And my mom meant if they didn't have more in the back (as they should) and he said, No, I already told you we only have those 2 left. Then a lady who also worked there tried to help us but she said the same thing because she went to the back "TO CHECK" but by then he probably had seen us talk and could've told her to say no because he had already said that. The guy looked very stressed from the very beginning when we got there and first took long to assist us. (He was stressed out and they weren't even more people in line, only us. I've seen other places where they have more people in line and they are not stressed out and rudely assisting customers.) I think they should move him to the back where he doesn't have interactions with customers because what kind of attitude is that? I don't know how he's in that position. We are FREQUENT clients to this location but who knows if we will be back soon.< /Text><user>115899969651680256197< /user><Rate>1< /Rate>< gmapID>

Filthy place!!! They need to clean this place more and be more faster! I asked if they could put more avocado salsa and it took them 15 min to do it i was already leaving by the time they put more also the floors were all dirty and the trash i was full i had to put my trash on top of the trash can!!! The chicken was also burnt so i had a bad experience at this pollo loca. All the other pollo locos i go to are way cleaner and has better food. Plz fix it !< /review>

5 Star Processing came highly recommended and based on my personal experience with them I see why. The process was simple and easy. The instructions provided every step of the way was very clear. The communication was amazing and Aryiana is absolutely the best. She made this process very easy for me. This was my first experience with a merchant and I'm happy my first experience was with 5 Star Processing.< /text>

This company gets 1star. It took over 3 weeks to get an approval. As I spoke with more and more people I realized they had no clue about the requirements for a low risk business. They had me pay 99$ and then after approval said ok now pay me 150$. That’s not cool. Everything should have been discussed in the beginning.<//Review>

5 Star Processing was recommended to me through a business alliance and now I see why. They have been nothing short of amazing in setting up my merchant account and guiding me every step of the way. We need more businesses that operate like 5 Star.< /review>

I just called today, 4/30/21, to get clarification on this company after seeing it advertised on YouTube and the lady which you can't hardly understand tells me that it will take 2 weeks to get a answer about approval, AND you can tell they are monitoring the calls because THEY CALLED ME RIGHT BACK AND I DIDN'T EVEN  GET TO LEAVE A MESSAGE, but in the meanwhile, they are asking for a NON REFUNDABLE 99 DEPOSIT! ??!...This is truly not right! So they expect you to pay BEFORE a approval letter is sent out to you and then we don't even know if it gets approved! So, AGAIN,  WHY should we pay a fee before knowing the actual results and outcome? Sad, preying on small and startup businesses like this!  The lady sounded like she was on her cell phone at home! I DON'T TRUST THIS! Please Beware!</text>

That is for the 5 Star Perks, not the application for the card. However, we did have someone on our team reach out to you after you expressed concern, and unfortunately, you hung up  on a team member of ours.\n\nWe fully disclose when you make your payment what the $99 is for\n\nThere is one-time membership NON REFUNDABLE fee of $99. This $99 also provides you additional perks with all the 5 Star Products and our exclusive partnership products. These extra perks offer you exclusive 5 Star bonuses and money-back offers in addition to the great offers Divvy provides Merchant Service Discounts & Free terminal options, exclusive credit building products, Affiliate Programs, rewards, and much more.\n\nWe add this also on the section where you are submitting your payment.\n\nYour paying for a one-time, lifetime membership fee to earn all the perks for only $99. You will gain access to the 5 Star Portal and be able to take advantage of additional business credit building products, perks, and business resources within. I authorize the transaction in the amount of $99 with 5 Star Processing. I forgo my right to dispute this transaction with my bank and will seek to resolve any issues with the merchant directly or through any other means.

<Review>I signed up for the business credit card to build my credit. They were thorough in what they asked me to provide. I followed the instructions, and was excited to receive my card. My transfers are working smoothly, and I am very happy building my business credit with this company. It opens up a lot of opportunities in the future for me, thanks to 5 Star Processing. It has been a great experience for me working with them.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>These people will take a $99 fee to process your application for a freakin secured credit card. I was told that if I don’t agree with the line of credit offers that they provide then the $99 fee is refundable. Now I’m trying to get in contact with these people to get a refund but they won’t answer me. They will try to take your money..

Update

This is my personal experience of what I feel about the membership that this company offers

What if the person doesn't want the perks and offers but they just want to get a unsecured credit card this company should give us the option to say no to pay the 99.00 fee.

Why did the company call themselves trying to check me! No I will not take down my review for two reasons

1 reason is once I went over to Facebook it was worse there then the other places that customers are complaining at this is what I read on their page I'm telling the truth of what I experienced

2nd reason is that from my experience from coming over to your website and filing out the inquiry

I have freedom of speech and I can tell people how I feel about a product that I started the process for

this is a platform where we all can express our experience on the way we as people felt remember a YouTube Commentator is telling people to sign up for this so I had to make sure I don't also be in a situation that a lot of other people have experienced as well.

Earlier Review
I filled out their little inquiry and right away they are asking for money kept talking about 99.00  I decided to look them up before I give them the moolah money and guess what they have so many negative reviews on here honey baby chile you better do research before you watch a YouTube commentator telling you to go sign up nope I'm erasing my information from the application they give you to fill out and if it sounds to good to be true boo boo kitty believe them okay! Don't be ignoring when people say it's something going cause I had my hopes up high but anyway Like I said I'm happy I read the comment section and reviews from all the good ones which it is good they experienced with this company and bad one's which tell me one thing this company have to stop taking 99.00 from ppl upfront and give people real unsecured business credit cards<//text>

This company is a scam. They will take your $99 fee and run. No one answers the phone. The card company they work with will email you and tell you there is no application fee. Then will offer you a secured card. They are taking advantage of small business.< /Review>

I don’t like that all the comments are turned off on their YouTube channel. That alone makes them suspicious. Get on BiggerPockets.com it’s like a Facebook for real estate with lots more valuable information. AND their YouTube channel is bomb, comments turned on and everything.< /Review>

This company is a scam... They tell u unsecured but that's not true.. and u can't get $10k as advertised... This company needs to be shut down... Im definitely filling a complaint... they take your $99 processing fee and don't offer the service they advertised.. you can never get anyone on the phone and in order to use this "unsecured" credit card you must transfer money on the credit card... that's not unsecure!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY....<//Review>

< review>
Horrible customer service! I ordered the business credit card and was told 5-7 days. I understand it’s new so I waited. It was then 14 days I reached out they said they would check No call back. They called me at about 21 days asked if I received it I said what’s the tracking number you should see I haven’t received it. They said they would go get the tracking number and call back. If there was a tracking number why call me and ask if I received it you should have known that I didn’t. I have verified my address 4 times, spoke with someone on the phone, email, and messenger they all say the same thing verify your address we will send out via FedEx  express. At this point I have no faith in this company. Today makes 33 days and I still don’t have my business credit card that I paid an application fee to receive!<//review>

As per my concern , 5 Star Processing payments didn't provide me with the complete list of required and additional information that would be needed for the merchant account but also their team help me a lot in getting my merchant account approved.  So thank you so much 5 starprocessing and their teams.<//review>

< review>
I usually, do not write negative reviews. I always prefer to deal with a company  directly if I have an issue, but this company concerns me greatly as they have not been cooperative in resolving my issue for the last two months.  My experience with this company has not been pleasant, but rather frustrating.  Unfortunately, their response time was  slow in the beginning and it appears they do not communicate with each other or add notes to applications or accounts.  I signed up for the business card in my company name Real Estate Concierge On A Rolle on November 14, 2020.  I heard nothing from them for about a week on the status of the application. I emailed them on 11/24/2020.  They responded on 11/27/20 to which they asked if I had applied to another company who also used Payvus as their processing system. Ending with if I had they would be unable to enroll me for their card. I responded the same day to confirm.  They responded on 12/01/20 stating that their financial department would look into this and have my $99 refund processed.  They asked for extra time to review some additional information.  I heard nothing from them and I emailed them again on 12/21/20 for a status update on my refund.  They responded on 12/22/20 with the following "We apologize for the delay. Our Financial Department will process the refund later today! Thank you for checking back in with us!".  I reached out to them again on 01/05/20 for a status update on  my refund they responded that evening with " Your refund is still in review. Do you happen to have another account thru Payvus ?".  The same question that I have already answered yes too, I have heard nothing from them since and I still have not received the refund of my $99.  It should not take two months to process a refund for a service that your company said they could not provide.< /review>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Report this company to your State Attorney General's Office.

They charge a $99 processing fee, they don't pull your credit ( there's no inquiry from this company and I applied in October). They do NOT report your tradeline to Dun and Bradstreet as advertised and at this point I believe they are only a virtual company and not a brick and mortar doing regular business. There's never a person that you can actually speak with and they want you to create a "ticket" and some nonexistent person will get back with you. I've been waiting over 2 months for a report to my credit file and nothing.

Be mindful giving them your Company information, these people are not here to help grow your business footprint they are the equivalent of a predator. Be diligent and watch your bank account, they double dip and duplicate withdrawals which are inconsistent to what you've scheduled. Do yourself and your Company a favor and partner with a more reputable Company that can help you navigate your business footsteps.

UPDATE: 1/17/2021
It has been almost 5 months and there has NOT been one report to D&B. The owner responded to all of the negative Google reviews with claims of miscommunication and promises to reach out to the real people that have been duped by their false advertising and their fake claims of helping you build business credit. To this date, I have not been contacted and I'm sure others have not either. Please do not deal with this dishonest company, they are unethical and have disgusting business practices .<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1609296317051, 'text': 'Hi Terri, we report to D & B on the 15th of the month. Once payment has been applied, it can take 1-3 months, depending on when you have been approved and when your payment is made on the card, and making sure the right information is provided to us also if your file is correct with D&B\n\nWe are a brick and motor and are located in CA 👍\n\nWe want to ensure you receive the 5 star experience you deserve, and I think it looks like some minor miscommunication. Except for a call from someone on our team tomorrow'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809ac73b16013737:0x55e836b2f15a4b20< /gmap_id></record>

IF this really is a company than I agree with the other reviewers that say they are a scam. I have called and emailed and never got a return phone call. I started a business and wanted to build my business credit and these crooks say they report you to the credit bureau and they dont because they dont even send you the credit card after they steal your $99 and dont answer the telephone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM!! F-<//text>

The Eureka AAA branch has exceptional service with a professional and friendly staff.  DMV services were flawless.  Definitely makes membership an extremely worthwhile asset!< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>While I have never written a negative review, today’s experience at the Eureka AAA DMV was hands down the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. The staff was rude, inconsiderate and incompetent. Apparently neither were concerned about the line of people waiting (on a time crunch/on a lunch break) as they chatted extensively about irrelevant things rather than actually streamlining and doing their job. One star is still too generous, and only because ultimately they were able to get the job done do I give that.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Everyone at this branch is very friendly! If they can't help you with the service you're looking for then they will direct you where to go (call, online, DMV) and are very gentle about it. This was my first time working with title transfers and insurance and they were very kind and were happy to answer the simple questions I had, which is a huge help on details instead of the confusing DMV website. I was in and out very fast aside from waiting in line, which was the time of day rather than the workers. :)<//Review>< GmapID>

Very rude snarky. Attitude. Seemed like I was a burden to asked questions. And staff seemed more ingaged  in talking amongst  themselves. Then helping  customers. And trying to get them on the telephone  is beyond ridiculous. Hung up on hold.  Automated  phone system  on endless loop and select option 1234 over and and over then hangs up</Review>

<text>This branch was very conscientious about Covid 19 protocols.

Some of the employees take there time (not all of them) so it can be a slower to get through the lines , but anything is better than dmv. With AAA membership you have the luxury of handling car registration and insurance at 1 place + you cant beat the towing services with your membership.</review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>My experience, for the first time in decades, was very poor.

The reason we have autoclub memberships is so that we have a pleasant and convenient experience when registering vehicles, inquiring about vacation plans, and of course, the emergency roadside services too. Who wants to stand in line and wait for hours on end at a DMV office?

Well the lady that served me at the counter was terribly ambivalent and indifferent towards me.

First, she said my membership was expired, I opened the app on my phone and showed her it was not, then she said, without ever offering to contact SoCal AAA, that I myself would have to call, and to get out of line and fix the problem.

I called SoCal, they verified that everything was in order, and even waited on the phone to verify with the staff at the local office in northern California where I was at... From the back of the line all over again where I was sent!!!

Fortunately, a gentleman who was handling reception noticed, talked to the rep on my phone, and then had his supervisor apprised of the situation at which point he bumped me up to second in line.

Unfortunately, however, I got the same condescending lady servicing me again and then their computers went down again just before the office closed.

I ended up going to a private registration service center in town where I was in and out in less than 9 minutes. Yes I had to pay a fee but that was gladly paid considering to the more than an hour of the abusive treatment I received at the autoclub office.<//Text>< Pics>

The tow truck guy who came out was super friendly and laid back. I forget his name...something that started with a J maybe Justin or Josh?

Not to be mistaken for AA...lol
On a serious note....Lots of free maps for traveling. Easy DMV services at AAA. Roadside services have gotten more limited over the years but if you meet their terms it's well worth it especially if you have an older vehicle.<//text>

<user_name>Alegria Sita</user_name><Review>Called for roadside assistance today and was told a tow truck was dispatched and we were a priority call... should be 60 min. 2-hours later, I called for an update and was told no tow was on the way, my tow was not covered. Had they called me to inform me they were not sending a tow truck I would have made my own arrangements immediately... instead, they felt it ok to have me waiting roadside on the highway with a 3-year Old with no help on the way for what turned out to be 5 hours.<//Review><Date>1566144518614</Date></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have an Specialty vehicle. It’s a Mercedes 309D van.

If you have a normal vehicle this probably doesn’t apply to you.

I signed up with AAA specifically for this vehicle and didn’t imagine the headache that came with it.
I don’t imagine I will continue with AAA after this year is over.
My vehicle wouldn’t start and it’s 4 blocks from the mechanic. 5 times in 24 hours they requested the wrong sized tow truck after I passionately expressed that I have a large vehicle that needs special consideration.

I wasn’t able to stay the night with the vehicle so I drove 45 min home over the snowy mountain. I had to drive back here this morning and after hours of phone time with them I’m still sitting here waiting for them. So frustrating that their system doesn’t include or consider my special needs in this matter.

So much wasted time and gasoline and missed days of work and delaying the mechanic work. I can’t imagine what it would have been like if I was far from home. Which is why I chose AAA for the security of having support when I need them on long far out road trips.

I will be researching a company that is RV specific. Wish me luck.< /review>< Pictures>

The visit on 2/26 however was a memorable visit for all the wrong reasons. The lady at the front counter happliy greeted the guest in front of me as well as the guest after me but for some reason not me. As the first point of contact with the representative, I did not feel welcomed or valued. Once I was called to review my policy loan for both my auto & home, the visit became  such that I felt it needed voicing. The woman who was supposed to assist me in ensuring my policy was working for me handled the entire conversation in a demeaning, condescending tone. I wanted to know why my policy had gone up just under $300 dollars this past year. I am not sure if she thought I was easily bullied but she offered no effort in ensuring my policy was up to date, or ways to ensure I was getting the best deal possible. I was treated as though I was wasting her time & once again of no value. I am very sad to have referred so many friends & family to the Eureka branch for their insurance needs.</Review>< username>

Would have given them a five but they have a couple of clerks that receive payments in the front that need to be further trained on customer service. Be friendly and smile I'm not the enemy.<//review>

<Review>You can take care of most of your DMV needs as well as get/renew/pay for insurance or roadside service.  The service is always friendly, and wait is nonexistent to short.  The wait time is made nicer by free wifi and coffee.<//Review>< gmapID>

Over a couple of visits, the extremely friendly, professional staff at the Eureka office went above and beyond in assisting me to enhance my understanding of services, and, though they didn't need to gave my family added benefit for no add'l charge. Despite how busy the office was,  at one pt., 4 staff were making absolutely certain the information was exactly correct. This office has ALWAYS provided excellent customer service, and we'll be back, year after year, and decade after decade simply b/c no other Auto-related Emergency Service comes close to helping as they have over many years. It only takes one Emergency in the middle of nowhere, to make the annual fee more than worth it!  Btw, cudos to all staff, but Shannon has the constant smile that let's you know she is NOT ever faking patience nor at all worried about the extra time needed to answer questions.<//text>

I was repeatedly told to stay with my vehicle which was totaled, resting 30 feet from the county road.

Don’t go there they charged me more to repair an item than it was worth. Rather that fixing the trimmer they replaced any and all parts and charged 40% more than I would have paid for the same parts direct from the dealer. I was upset when I left at the hefty price tag so I did not look at the trimmer until I got home. At that point I discovered they jury rigged the throttle cable to carburetor. Not sure how you can get something that simple screwed up but they did. I had to drive 15 miles to get them to correct their mistake. My advise stay away unless you like wasting money and are ok with poor service and communication from these guys.</Text>

I took my weed eater to see if there was a way to repair the small gas tank to Mike and his Sharpening Shop. He told me he had some plastic repair compound that could fix the small crack on the gas tank. I also explained to him that the weed eater was kind of stubborn to get started sometimes. He said he would check it out. I asked him for an estimate on the repairs and told me he would call me with one in a few days. About 3 weeks past and I called his shop to see what was going on with the repair. The girl that answered told me that it would be over a month before they could get to checking my weed eater. She called me later that same day and told me that there technician checked the weed eater and found out that the carburetor was malfunctioning and that there is no parts available for it. She explained that there was a $45 inspection fee. This shop used to be my go to shop for lawn mower repairs. But now it seems there just not interested in making repairs. They already knew that there are no parts for my weed eater, I had taken it to them before and they had told me this. All I needed was to patch the gas tank. It seems there not interested in doing small repairs anymore. I feel they will be going the way of Justus Lawnmower in downtown Turlock, it’s just sad.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I'm not big on writing reviews but this needs to be known. I ordered some parts from the Sharpening Shop in February and it took over 6 weeks for me to get them. I understand that things take some time but when I called to see how long the parts were going to take they were rude and not very helpful to me at all. I felt like I wasn't important to them that my business didn't matter. I deal with different parts places all the time and have never had a problem like this before. I was very disappointed in how long it took and how I was treated< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809108809131c3b1:0xc9e5d4f5b37bcf7a<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
I have purchased from here previously with same issues  but I thought of giving it another
Try . But again Less then 2 week  from purchase  and had to bring  back 2 pieces of lawn equipment back due to not working properly.  Seems they make their  money  on fixings things they just sold  With the 7 day return policy .2 weeks is about the time problems start .<//Review>

< Review>
Grazie Doppio Zero for one of the best dining experiences we’ve had in a long time! Food was amazing (compliments to the chef!) the service was exemplary (thank you Michele C. for such an enjoyable lunch) and the restaurant itself was comfortable and cozy (like dining on a patio in Southern Italy). Easily one of our favorite spots when craving Italian food. Can’t wait to try other items on the menu. We’ll be back!< /Review>

Great ambiance and service. Sat outside on a sunny weekday afternoon. The potato croquettes were superb. The fried calamari and shrimp (mostly calamari) was light and airy. The clams were a little too salty for my taste. The dough for the pizza napule was very unique for a pizza, next time I would like to try their calzone and pasta.</review>

<Review>Really great service and staff. The decor and seating is well done and plenty of outside seating. They allow for 🐕 too. The food is prepared very well, on point, and on time. There are a lot of meals I would like to try next time. If you like wine pairing they do well for the selections from Italy. The wood fired dough is perfect. The burning is expected and tastes good with the zuppa.< /Review>< pictures>

Really nice staff. Excellent food. Great cocktails and beers. We were all genuinely surprised. Only went here because every other restaurant in town had an hour long wait, they sat our party of 5 right away. They ended up having great outdoor seating, great heaters. Felt very fancy without ridiculous prices.

<text>I was trying to discover new italian restos in the area. I would not lie the free arancini for every $20  order to go did provide some motivation to try this place out. Ordered a pasta and croquettes for the first order, they did not add the free item. Even asked the server who return asked the manager who said that the offer was over already. I even showed the their website to no avail. 2nd time tried doing the order with the pizza, the free item was even listed in the ticket but was not included in the final order.

The food was tasty and the server that's why theu still get two stars, despite not being true to thei website.< /text>< pics>

This place was one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. The food was good and their truffle fries are amazing! The atmosphere was comfy but fancy at the same time. This is definitely a must try. I recommend you try the truffle fries as an appetizer.< /Review>

<text>Happen to come across this restaurant today and I’m glad I did. I love Italian food and just found my favorite spot of all time. I don’t have a a picture of the spinach ravioli filled with wild mushroom and ricotta and fondue truffle sauce. The oxtail pasta which my husband had was sooo delicious also. The featured drink is Vesuvio and the dessert is lemoncello cake, both delicious 😋😍.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNr-4iqsYTEwmUm4IfMYgVPxHnK7N7ctXBWxvw0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOco8BD-F8IIlk6iKqDSPYj-7vYmSeyAfvH5q7h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVbi3PwRmhHwCevbOKF7xo0naEC4e-nsw_RFcV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I predict this will become my favorite neighborhood restaurant! Staffed by Italians, a separate Italian wine list, beautiful inside and patio space, and a focus on simple preparations that let the gorgeous ingredients shine. Don't miss their homemade limoncello!< /review>

<Review>I’ve been here twice and have had fantastic food both times. The person who said her pizza was overdone doesn’t know a wood fired pizza. Omg even the crust is amazing...all the ingredients from Italy are fantastic and the service is great! My new favorite place until I can go back to Italia!!2<//Review>< rating>

<Review>We did an online request for curbside pickup at the Concord location. We got to the required parking space on time and called the designated phone number, where we got a voicemail instructing us to leave a message, which we did. We waited 5 minutes, called again and got the same message. At this point I got out of the car and walked to the restaurant (about 25 yards) where I was greeted by a hostess. She was chatting with a restaurant employee. It was only 5:45 and the restaurant had about 10 seated customers so wasn’t busy at all. I told her the problem with the phone and she informed me that they were “busy and didn’t have time to answer it”! The other employee brought my bag of food and I left.
Now on to the food...My grilled octopus was so tough that I had couldn’t get my teeth through it! I had to toss the whole thing. My husband’s fried calzone was soggy and greasy with very little filling. It couldn’t be picked up because there was no substance to it. He scraped the little bit of filling out and ate it, tossing the crust.
Needless to say we will not return. I am first-generation Southern Italian and call this restaurant a disgrace to my cuisine.< /Review>< pictures>

We went here during COVID-19 lockdown for my wife's bday late November and ate outside. We were seated immediately and they even positioned the patio heaters so we would be comfortable.

We ordered truffle fries, calamari and the Brussel sprouts for appetizers and the Brussel Sprouts and Calamari were 5 star! Highly recommended! The truffle fries were good but not super stellar as the other 2.

My wife had the squid ink fettuccine with clams and mussels, daughter had the spaghetti with marinara, son had the lasagna and me not being a pasta guy, ordered the bistecca (Ribeye). Food was delicious! Definitely would come back again. The service was also great!

5 stars all around.</Text>

I went there for an engagement dinner with my parents and my now fiances parents.

The staff was great and friendly, all the food tasted amazing!

We got: Croquettes, Brussel Sprouts and the Burrata for apps. Highly recommend the croquettes 👍

Mains: I got the Marechiaro basically squid ink pasta with clams and scallops, really good but really salty.
She got the spinach ravioli. One of the recommend dishes, which was also really good but also salty.

Dessert: All great! I got the Tiramisu one of the best ones I've had in a while! She got the Limoncello Cake, I'm not big on lemon desserts but that cake was really good! Everyone else got butterscotch pudding it was awesome but the one thing is the pudding doesn't look like butterscotch because they add chocolate to it and effects the flavor but I liked it lol.

Overall great experience and will go there again!< /text>

When they tow your vehicle they don't even know if they took it and no one there knows how much it'll cost you to retrieve your vehicle back. Calling multiple times I've gotten so many different prices. When you arrive to pick up your impounded vehicle you see all their trucks and employee cars park illegally blocking the sidewalk, parked on the side walk and even block the two way street making it look and feel like a one lane street and as your waiting to get your vehicle released all the drivers are looking at you in a very creepy uncomfortable way and it does not feel very safe here. Avoid this place at all costs.<//review>

<Review>After We waited for another tow company for 2 hours who never showed up ..... Im glad I chose to call these guys here. They picked up the phone right away @11pm .... got the info they needed , quoted me straight up just how I like it to be without beating around the bush and 💥 bam they arrived in less than 30 mins. They will officially be our go to for any towing and we own tire shops so we will definitely be recommending them 24/7 👏🏻</Review></record></dataset><record>

Pepes Towing was great. They helped me out of a very tight spot with my vehicle. Drew , the driver was very helpful, and stuck it out with me till the end. After all he did, I was surprised  at how little the bill was. Great job Drew.<//Review>

I was definitely in a bind, as my car stopped running while I was in the left turn lane. Pepe's towing arrived in less than 10min. He smoothly maneuvered in front of me without disrupting traffic, and towed me home. I was able to pay over the phone as soon as I called by talking to Don. The driver, Luis, was able to diagnose my issue. Pepe's Towing is a very quick and efficient towing service and the $85 dollar towing fee is very reasonable in my opinion. Both Don and Luis were extremely nice and professional. I recommend Pepe's towing as a go-to service in the Inland Empire.<//review>

One of the best tow company's I've ever called out to get my car towed. One of the cheaper tows I've had to pay for a tow. The driver that came out, Louis, was fantastic. Very understanding of the situation. Took care of the our needs and the car. Made sure we were comfortable and that the car was secured well on the tow truck. Louis turned a very bad night into an overall good night. He couldn't fix the problems but that's because he didn't have a full repair shop on the side of the road. If I need a tow, I will go through Pepe's in colton over any other tow company within 25 miles.</text>

Had a great experience with Pepe's Towing. I made the call at about 1:30 am on 02-03-2020 after calling three other "24 hr" towing companies. Only one answered and said their trucks were tied up at the moment. When I spoke with the dispatcher for Pepe's and told her my situation she gave me a price right then, spoke calm and didn't give no indication of an attitude. When the driver Louis showed up he was very professional and got right to work. Asked where vehicle was to be towed and got going. He did advise me though that they only do towing for the police, so I got really lucky that they were available to tow my vehicle. Thanks again Louis and to the dispatcher. My apologies for not remembering your name, but thanks again for your help. God Bless.<//Review>

Pepe's Towing came through BIG TIME! My car was not starting--nothing worked!
Pepe's responded within a very short amount of time. Josh (driver) was very helpful, considerate and professional.  More drivers should be like him. I also felt their pricing was very fair and reasonable. I highly reccomend Pepe's!</text>

<response>None<//response><review>Terribly overpriced. Enough to say WORSE than highway robbery.  I'm an out of state buyer and bought something from the auction that's 2 blocks away from their business. Per policy, auction requires all vehicles be towed out. Looked on google maps and saw pepe's was a minute away, SCORE! Delight quickly turned to dismay. Called and explained I just needed them to pull the truck off the property and set it on the street (10 minute job and flexible. It can be done between now and next Wednesday  6 DAYS away).. I was blindsided by the price, $350 damn dollars. We often hear the term 'I was left speechless'.  I was legit at a loss for words. I could hear the lady on the other side of the phone " Sir, are you there?" :::tap tap tap:::: as she tapped it to make sure it was working properly. Thanks, but no thanks.

I think Pepe been puffin too much peyote</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>These guys are the absolute best in the Inland Empire. My truck had its wheels and tires stolen, leaving it on the ground. The thieves left it propped halfway up a curb in a tight spot, it was a mess. A driver from another company came out, the driver looked at it said he couldn't do anything and left. I called Pepe's, they sent out Chris and this guy worked for about 45 minutes getting my truck slowly and safely loaded up. He was an absolute professional and went above and beyond to get my truck towed. Call these guys if you need a tow, they're the absolute best.< /text>< Pictures>

The staff that works the office is completely rude. I’ve had to call 7 different times and had spoke with “Don” he is completely rude and unprofessional. This towing  company is a joke and always will be a joke. I would recommend not using this company they have no sense of Professionalism. Very displeased with the service.< /Text>

<review>Sorry your company is a bunch of thevies. My mom and i were in a Denny's eating breakfast and you towed our RV for no good reason!! when i called you, you tried to blame it on security when I told you security was standing right by me and said he had no part in it you changed your story to try and blame Denny's and said you told the workers you were going to tow it. You lied again i had a manager write a letter denying any knowledge to either of those claims. Then you tried we were parked their since 7 am again Denny's said we were not there at 7 am we were in fact asleep miles away from there at 7 am we didn't wake up until way latter  in the morning!! we brought our registration like you said now your trying to say it's the wrong registration!!! I'm homeless you seriously think I'm going to pay on someone else's RV?? Also my mother has life sustaining medication in the RV yet they won't allow her access to it unless we pay $128.50 that is such B.S!!</review>< Pics>

This was a traffic collision where I was unfortunately forced to tow my son's vehicle home.
Thankfully, at the time of evening of this disaster, Pepe's Towing Service flatbed arrived, swept up my son's broken car and delivered it with kit gloves right in my driveway. Perfect!
Thank you.</Text>

I was recently ilegally towed under the california law code AB 2210 by a spotter that works with this company. I have witnesses that seen and have been tageted by the same person and also have photos that confirm these actions. I will now have to take legal actions for that this predatory business is taking advantage of those who don't know the law< /text>

Yesterday, my battery died, in rush hour traffic, on the eastbound 60. Just imagine. I was able to get my car just 2 feet on the safe side of the white shoulder line and there I sat in 100° degree outside temperature, above 70 years of age and wearing a knee-high CAM boot. I called the NAC, which usually means 45 minutes to an hour wait for a tow. NAC informed Pepe’s Towing in Riverside would be the service coming out. While waiting, a tow truck appeared but there was no mention of Pepe’s emblazoned on the vehicle. I called Pepe’s to ask what their trucks looked like. A very kind Anna answered and assured me it was the freeway assist people who tow unfortunates like me off the freeway and that their truck was en route. Pepe’s actually arrived in less than 30 minutes. The driver who assisted me was Beto and I couldn’t have had a more helpful encounter. Beto’s manner was professional, knowledgeable, friendly and I knew I was being well taken care of, which means a lot to an elderly lady. Beto backed my car into my garage safe and sound. Thank you very much indeed Pepe’s Towing Service...well done.< /text>

< review>
85 bucks for a tow just literally across the street? What made it even worst 😭 is that they were well over a half hour late arriving too.
When I made arrangements by phone they told me the tow truck would arrive in 15 to 20 minutes. It took the tow truck over 45 minutes to get to Central Riverside just from Colton. Am not satisfied with you Pepe's.</review>

I was stuck on the 10 freeway. Other towing services would not help me and it was irritating that none of them were of any help. I called Pepe's and they were there in 30 minutes and were able to help me out. Thanks guys 👍🏼<//Review>

<Text>Went to pick up my vehicle and asked to inspect it for damage before I signed for it. The woman (Daisy) at the window expecting me to not understand spanish called back to the yard calling me a "culo" or ass if you do not no. My mother who was with me at the time also heard her. This is a very unprofessional establishment. They also are in violation of several cvc codes that they are supposed to abide by. Be weary if your vehicle gets taken there. Nothing was missing out of my vehicle but the seat was moved back and the e brake was released which I set every time. Shady practices as far as I am concerned.< /Text><user_name>Matt Gould</user_name></record>

Stole my sister’s car while they visited me and my family at our apartment for 4 hours. $400 to release a vehicle that was wrongfully towed in the first place. Criminal organization.< /review>

Hey there, this was my first time coming to this place and first time trying Indian food.
Firstly, I now love Indian food because of this restaurant.
Secondly, I've lived in this neighborhood for years and now, at 26 years old, I came in with my girlfriend and wow, the employees are so cool, friendly and patient!
I felt very welcomed here and as much as the food was delicious, the employees make me want to come back. Great job Samosa crew, you've gained a new customer.</Text>

<Review>GREAT food. Love how inexpensive it is and that it is all vegetarian. This newer location is the same as the other locations, but apparently with a smaller selection.

If you look at the website, it says the combo plate is about 8 dollars, but here it is actually around 10 dollars.

Still a good deal for the large amount of food, but just to warn you, it's more than I had expected going into it.

I highly recommend eating here. A good cheaper Indian food option than most expensive sit down places.</Review>< Pictures>

Indian food served like Chinese fast food platter except the restaurant is pretty nice.  Outdoor seating is cute but unstable.cauliflower, garlic bread are good. 3 choice combination with brown rice is $10.50. Was told the fried milk ball is pretty good. Parking is difficult as usual, walked instead.< /review>

Food is so good! And reasonably priced! Not the fanciest place (you order up front, get a tray full of food, and find a seat) but definitely worth going.

They make the samosas and naan fresh and bring it to your table.< /text>

<text>The food was okay but the service sucked. The darker complexioned man in his mid 20's was one of the rudest people I've encountered to everyone he came into contact with- with the exception of a few  attractive female customers. Stay away from the restaurant with the miserable man.< /text>< pics>

Only had delivery here, but it was really tasty... it somehow all tastes rather homemade, like the extremely unnaturally bright colors and saltiness are not present in these foods. I think they even homemake their own paneer, which I've only come across one or two other Indian restaurants that do. Price is quite fair and afforable, and I only wish I lived closer...<//review>

I also frequent the Culver City location...however, prefer this Silverlake spot.< /text>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I was visiting Universal studios with my parents and we were in hunt for a vegetarian Indian restaurant. This place was open till 10pm and we decided to give it a try.

And we loved it! They have a cafe style service where you can choose the items by looking at them behind a counter. There are ample curries to choose from and everything we tried was delicious.

Must try: combo plate with 3 curries, naan and rice, gulab jamun, chai.

It is not a cozy or a romantic place but is very good for a quick vegetarian lunch or dinner.</Review>< Name>

I really like this place. It's got a great vibe. Good music. Clean. Free WiFi. Some of the best Indian food in LA! Been here a good number of times now. Changing my solid review because of inconsistency. The entree food is always very good in taste, but is also very watery sometimes and I end up feeling kinda cheated because it's not fair to serve so much liquid to customers as an entree. Sometimes the pakoras are so lazily/poorly made they are nearly inedible, and the portion is small. Sometimes the pakoras are an incredible deal both on quantity and flavor and simply amazing. Most annoying is the inconsistency in how much food the server decides to give you. It always feels like they are trying to nurse the food that's out until closing time rather than serving the same amount every time. 3 small pieces of veggie butter chicken and a bunch of sauce is pretty weak as a serving. Why so little rice sometimes. Rice is cheap. Naan is sometimes soft and flavorful, but sometimes it is more bland and rock hard.
Will only go now when I'm craving the wonderful flavors and hope it's a good day!<//review>

Let me start by saying im a meat eater and I was very pleased with the paneer and the roasted cauliflower. If they had a tikka it would have been five stars.  The light kick of heat on the paneer was perfect and of course the raita and naan were delicious. Perfect place for quick indian food<//review>

<Text>Background: I am neither vegetarian nor vegan, but I do enjoy dishes of those varieties. This review is for a takeout order.

The restaurant was nice, well lit, and clean, with a cafeteria-style order-at-the-counter set up. Funky, urban vibe. The people who work there are very nice, service is prompt, and prices are very reasonable - the portion of food for $10 is very generous.

The food: I ordered a combination plate with rice & garlic naan. The garlic naan was my favorite part of the meal. My combination plate came with 3 items: paneer, Chana masala, and veggie chicken.

The paneer had an odd texture, the Chana masala was bland, and the veggie chicken was also bland, but as far as veggie meat goes, it wasn't bad. The lack of heat was a major bummer.</Text>< pics>

<Review>This is the best restaurant in the land. I picked up my wife from the airport and was more excited about the chance of eating at Westwoods... and was not disappointed. Best BBQ, best nice drinks.. best service.< /Review>< userid>

<review>Been going here for years. Almost all my birthdays for the past 5 years. Last night was my worst experience there. Found a fingernail in my drink. Told the manager and offered me his business card that are held up front for anyone to take so I don’t know how that helps. Didn’t seem genuine at all. Worked in a restaurant for about two years as well and we definitely take much better of our customers there.< /review><user_name>Francisco Gutierrez</user_name><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Split and it was plenty of food! Fantastically delicious lunch! The spicy Cajun boil half I had was amazingly delicious! Wow! It had so much flavor! Spicy goodness too! Yummy! The side salad was fresh and super delicious too! My mother said her half was really good, nice and spicy with good seasoning.</text>

Called to book a reservation for a party of 7, the girl that answered said they are all full which is understandable for a Saturday evening so then I asked for the following day, which she  didn't make an effort at all to try to accommodate us at any available time she simply said they are "pretty" booked too.
Not from the area we wanted to try something new, definite bad bad impression.< /Review>

I went for my birthday. Their prices kind of went up since the pandemic, but whatever. Still great food. The waitress accidentally spilled beans all over my Mom, so they gave us half off our bill, so that was nice, she was apologetic and nice about it.</text>

Service was friendly and amazing, their strawberry lemonade was the perfect thirst quencher for this heat. I got the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, and while it was all right, the texture of the thick pickle slices and the flavor overpowered the flavor of the charred pulled pork and other ingredients. Minus the pickles, it was a great sandwich. Their corn bread has got to be hands down the best corn bread I've ever eaten at a restaurant ever, and their honey butter or whatever it is they use is sweet, yet flavorful, and compliments the corn bread perfectly. The bacon and cheese fries came out looking good, and tasted even better than they looked! You can pour the cheese on top yourself, or dip as you please. I am unsure what kind of cheese it is exactly, but it is the perfect cheese to pair with the bacon, without overpowering itself. The fries were evenly seasoned and made with a small crisp, so even though they had their toppings on, they did not get soggy for a while. My friend also had the Santa Ana steak and shrimp or whatever it's called, and the meat was amazing, but they used a type of seasoning that was way too powerful in the pepper area. So he scraped most of the seasoning off, and the meat was a 5/5 again. The atmosphere was busy, but lovely, with a welcoming vibe to it. When it gets busy, they hand you a buzzer, which makes everything easier, so you can step out until it is your turn. The prices were very affordable for the value of the food, and I definitely enjoy that it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for some delicious BBQ. I love coming to this place, and I can't wait to come back.< /review>

Anyways I ordered the Brisket Burger with bacon and cheese and onion strings. The brisket pieces were tasty, with the bacon and melted cheddar mixed in. The sandwich had a crunch to it and WOW!! This was a great tasting burger and you would have to eat it to enjoy the experience and flavors combined.< /Review>

Whenever I come from Florida to Fresno, I stop here for the best tri-tip in America. The service is great. The food is great. I will make it my personal mission to replicate the tri tip from Westwoods. (A little side note, masks optional is awesome)<//Text>

They missed a salad but added fries. The Tri Tip was awful. No crust, undercooked, and no flavoring. It more like a roast. Ribs didn't have the original appeal. The chicken was good but the beef dishes were way off. Hope it gets better.</text>< date>

<text>The BBQ chicken medallions were delicious! Really good with their BBQ sauce. Just wish there was a little more for the price you pay. The jalapeño cornbread was really good! Nice little spicy kick to the bread. The broccoli was good. Not the freshest. The potato salad was tasty! Good service. Good lunch. Recommended!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Worst thing I can say is that the lighting is poor and that's why my pictures aren't the best. But everything else...from Kylee, our server, to the hostess, to the food...EVERYTHING else was great. I'm talking all 6 people in my group... kids included...great experience, great food.<//review>

I have been here several time and had nothing but great service, however today was not the case . Waited for an hour for food and when food came out , the mash potatoes were cold , the guacamole was brown , not even green and Texas toast was toasted only on one side ! When I go to comment about this the waiter named Nick who rolls his eyes with the management in front and didn’t even correct his awful behavior! Paid over $250  in food and drinks for a disrespectful server and on top of that when walking out had a worker who was on expo commenting fowl comments at me and my family !  Need to step up in management and definitely need to train staff on being respectful especially if your spending over $250 on food</review>< Pictures>

I like the Westwoods BBQ. It's very nice! The BBQ brisket burger was out of this world. I can't wait for this place to open back up for dining because the inside looks like it would be the place to be on a Friday evening!</Text>

The food was flavorful however the ribs were cold and the Tri-Tip was luke warm  . It was mother's day which was fairly busy I guess  . We had no reservations and only had a 15 min wait to be seated . The staff is all young and seems to lack on the respect  . They rush you thru like they rush their lives , that was the biggest turn down . Might return on a weekday when there are less people and give it a second shot .<//Review>

Ordered some catering trays for pick-up. Food is always AMAZING - Hands down some of the best St. Louis Ribs and BBQ Pulled Pork you can find! Ordered over $500 worth of food 24 hours in advance and it was ready and waiting for me at pick-up time. Customer service is top-notch as well! Had help carrying trays to my vehicle, despite the fact that they were crazy busy in the middle of a lunch rush! I never felt like I was a burden or that any of them were stressed with lunch/xmas rush. They were genuinely happy to help. We will continue to support Westwoods both as a family and fellow small business! If you are thinking of giving them a try - stop thinking and GO! You will not regret it!< /review>

Got the sampler platter.  Everything was really good.  The chilly was great,  the fried chicken strip exceeded any expectation I had... the tri tip and ribs were tender and very good also.  The BBQ sauce was the only thing that wasn't exceptional.<//Text>

<username>Hey Hey</username><text>Food is good but the service is so bad it doesnt matter. Staff ignored my table, didn't bring us refils or sauces, or check in at all. We had to ask to order, ask for boxes, and ask for the check to leave. When the waitress did come around she didn't talk to the table but quietly flirt with my boyfriend at the edge of the table making him relay the messenge. Then they put automatic gratuity on the tip, when they weren't suppose to. I guess they new we weren't gonna tip after that aweful service. The food is good if you're ready to tolertate aweful service to get it.</text></record>

The food is delicious! All of it! The beef ribs, tri tip, pork ribs, salmon, fried chicken, and all of the sides are perfect! The Mediterranean chicken skewer dinner is amazing. We have been here with family, friends, and on dates many times and it has never let us down. I highly recommend giving it a try.< /Text>

<Text>I had the salad with a grilled chicken skewer. Way to much blue cheese for me but I picked it out. The produce was real fresh. My buddy had the pulled pork, and it was a pile of it. Thanks for being open. They had an outside seating area but we rolled out.< /Text>< name>

Ordered 1 hour in advance and food was still not ready.  They are serving indoors at full capacity.  Had to wait an extra 20 mins after my pick up time in a CROWDED in door establishment.  The purpose of ordering to-go is to avoid being around crowds.<//text>

Had a delicious dinner to celebrate my husbands new job.  Though we had to get it to go, the girls were so helpful and friendly and made sure we had everything we needed!  They even added a special touch to my husbands dessert with "Congrats".  The food was delicious and nice and hot when we arrived.  Thank you Westwoods for an incredible experience!</Review>

Great place for carnivores. Location is bit crowded parking but once inside, let the fun begin. Very clean surroundings considering the format, service on-point, and most importantly awesome food from the kitchen. TIPS: Be sure to check out the specials menu, try the ribs, they are among the best I have ever had, check out the cool historic photos on the way to the restrooms, save room for home made dessert.< /Text>

I was impressed the amount of food. Although the price point sort of matched amount, the food was good stuff.  I have their Pulled Pork Sandwich and a side of Mac n' Cheese (was an upcharge since not included with the sandwhich).  Tried their Appetizer was Green Beans and it was amazing.  Crispy fried exterior and soft Bean.  The pulled port was lathered lightly in the sweet tangy BBQ sauce, not too overwhelming.

I give 4 stars for this establishment during COVID since there was only outside seating available in the hot summer evening.</Review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>First time. Westwood's is special. My sweetheart and I ordered the "Blue Cheese Wedge" I have never eaten a better Wedge in my life. The place was Slammed.. And we were treated as if we were at a smaller establishment. We sat at the bar and the service was tops. The manager,.Kirk came by and was pleased. Our main course was a Steak encrusted with Blu Cheese. It was cooked to perfection. I will return!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Normally this has been my favorite place to eat but I had a horrible takeout experience. I pre ordered at 11 am and waited almost 2 hours past my pickup time. They need to do better at prioritizing because they kept putting the DoorDash orders first which was ridiculous.< /Review>< username>

A comfy atmosphere paired with a friendly and atentive staff make for a wonderful restaurant experience. Having an ATM in the front of the restaurant is definitely a plus, especially if you need to get change for a tip. They have an expansive menu, at affordable prices. They put their lemonades (which are delicious) in mason jars, adding to the country aesthetic they go for. The burgers and other meats my party ordered were perfectly cooked, and delicious. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys steak, or a family friendly restaurant with a friendly atmosphere and good food.</Text>

My husband warned me don't get fish in a meat joint. What can I say he was right. Husband also noted stay away from the Beef ribs, what did they do to that poor cow was how he put it ....but Saint Louis ribs are great, sides are great, tried trip is awesome as are the burnt ends!! Overall though service is always good,  drinks are fantastic and we usually get in quickly. Just for the love of all things holy don't get the Salmon.

We came early for lunch on a Friday, which was good timing, because by the time we left, there was a line. I got a pulled pork sandwich and my husband got the tri tip ends sandwich. Both were excellent. I liked the crispy fries. The potato salad is a little bland, but not too bad. Service was friendly and fast. I would definitely come again.< /Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I tried this place for the first time last Monday with some friends. I ordered the two meat combo with BBQ ribs and tri-tip. Those barbecue ribs were some of the best ribs I ever had in my 21 years of life. The tri-tip was cooked to perfection. I also had the mac and cheese and baked beans for sides. The baked beans were phenomenal but the mac and cheese needed a little more moisture in it. I would have liked it better if it was more creamy. They also have a great outside dining area under a shade structure so the heat can't touch you and it is right in front of the Kings River so it is a beautiful view. I will definitely be going back.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I ordered take-out one night and to be honest, I was not impressed with the Tri-Tip sandwich. Also, the collard greens was too salty and the bacon grease made it unbearable. It's as if they aren't tasting any of the food before serving it. I will say the drinks and dessert was satisfactory but I'm still having buyer's remorse.</Review>< resp>

Atmosphere is lively and hopping! I sat at the bar and got good service for not having a dedicated waiter... The steak, ribeye, was mediocre, not cooked medium (you can tell they rushed it) and very grisly. Baked potatoes are good. I noted though a lot of things that need attention as far as cleaning goes...</Text>

<Review>We have been to Westwoods a few times for friends, food and drinks. Today for fathers day we stepped it up. Husband did the beef ribs and I did Salmon. I just paid over 25$ for a baked potato and some sad dried up small thing that used to swim.  My husband warned me don't get fish in a meat joint. What can I say he was right. Husband also noted stay away from the Beef ribs, what did they do to that poor cow was how he put it ....but Saint Louis ribs are great, sides are great, tried trip is awesome as are the burnt ends!! Overall though service is always good,  drinks are fantastic and we usually get in quickly. Just for the love of all things holy don't get the Salmon. This meal was too sad to take pictures of.< /Review>< user_name>

<review>We came early for lunch on a Friday, which was good timing, because by the time we left, there was a line. I got a pulled pork sandwich and my husband got the tri tip ends sandwich. Both were excellent. I liked the crispy fries. The potato salad is a little bland, but not too bad. Service was friendly and fast. I would definitely come again.<//review>< user>

We've been going to Westwoods.  The food is always amazing.  During this pandemic, we decided to order takeout from WW for our anniversary. We purchased the chicken wings and a couple feast platters.  We know that normally fried foods don't transfer well and was prepared to use our air fryer to crisp up the food.  However, when we got it home, there was no need to do so! Everything was still crispy and delicious.  Thank you Westwoods for still proving quality food!<//Text>

<review>We had ordered some food to go last night and were disappointed in the quality of there food. We had ordered two brisket burgers and and pulled pork sandwich and everything was extremely dry and salty.
The fries were not fresh by any means. They seemed like they have been sitting under a heat lamp all day long.  And for as much as the brisket buger cost you think they would put slices of brisket on it. Not the left over bits from the brisket making it look like pulled pork. So if you are going to order food to go just be careful. The quality just wasn't there.</review>< Date>

It's delicious if you love cornbread, and made perfect everytime. The wings are just okay..when I ask for hot wings I expect a kind of buffalo or Louisiana hot sauce type of wing and the wings were tasty but really sweet season is used on them which was weird to me. Tasty but if you're looking for Buffalo wings, steer clear. The Pulled Pork is awesome and always  consistent, not chewy and great with their bbq sauce. As for this particular day in question we got the worst seat in the house. Me and my gf could barely fit our drinks on the table there was so much clutter on it. The waitress had a hard time finding a place to put my side of ranch...Let me repeat. The table was so small and cluttered our waitress had to look around for an empty space to put a SIDE OF RANCH DRESSING on the table.<//Text>< Time>

My favorite BBQ place to go for dinner! My favorites are the grilled artichoke or fried pickles for appetizers, the wedge salad to start and then the tri tip sandwich.  The feast is always great to order and take home the extras. DeLish!!! I love their St Louis style ribs.  Smoke Turkey ciabatta with avocado is another great sandwich if you don't want beef.  I like the Strawberry lemonade in a Mason jar or from the bar...I have to say they make a great Old Fashioned.  Thanks to this pandemic they now have a really nice patio set up.  As for staff...they have always been courteous.  I have never been disappointed when I have  been to Westwoods.< /Text>

<review>I've been here a total of 3 times so far. The first 2 were great. Loved the drinks and the food. But the 3rd time, I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs for $30. Honestly it was super disappointing. The ribs were so chewy and I struggled to separate them. I know they're usually better than this because I have had them before. I didn't finish them. Might reconsider coming here again. The food isn't cheap so it has to be worth the price. This time, it wasn't.< /review>< Pictures>

Me and my husband came here for dinner and we weren't disappointed.  The wings were amazing and the onion rings were huge. We shared a rack of ribs that were absolutely delicious and fall off the bone.  The atmosphere was very chill also which ward much appreciated.  Will be coming back.< /text>

< Review>
Fantastic food and great service. The place smells smokey and delicious from the moment you walk in. I like that you can see into the kitchen as your food is being prepared. I got a pulled pork sandwich which came in a generous portion at an affordable price. They have a great selection of local beers as well. If you're in the Fresno area, definitely stop by here and pick up some BBQ!</Review>

If you are flying down the road through Fresno, take a deep breath and stop by Westwood's. Fantastic BBQ. They have never disappointed me.  Don't forget to take a piece of carrot cake for the road.<//review>

This is a great place to grab some great barbecue. Even if you're not quite in the mood for barbecue there's a lot of other options available on the menu to make just about any diner happy. This restaurant has a great atmosphere and is very pleasant. I would recommend this to anyone who is a barbecue connoisseur or even just wants a great burger and fries.</Text>

<Text>Sadly we were so disappointed with our lunch.our favorite is the Tri Tip
Dip it was so full of grisle we asked for a knlfe to cut the edible meat off. The amount of meat was about 1/2 the usual amount but the price was the same. We had to ask 3 times to getwhat we needed to take left overs to go.waitress was very slow. This is a favorite Location for us , we will try again, hopefully this was just a bad day.</Text>< rate>

I love BBQ so I finally got around to trying this place out and man was I disappointed. The prices are outrageous. The brisket was  SO dry and was served in a pool of fatty liquid. The ribs were completely overcooked and almost meatless. My overall experience was just flat out bad. You can get better BBQ from a gas station rib sandwich.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>We came into town Thursday night 10/24.  Checked into our hotel at 830 and already were recommended to Westwoods.  We sat right away and were helped by Beth! (Like the KISS song...bet she's never heard that one before)  Super knowledgeable and patient with first timers.   Portobello Fries, Aged Ribeye, and smoked brisket. 10 out of 10!  Thank you Beth!

We left town today 10/26, Ate at Westwoods again!  This time, we expected a wait, took us longer to be pried from the dessert display, filled with fresh epic carrot cake.
Ally was out waitress and like Beth, knowledgeable,  patient and shes got jokes!  She was selling the move to Fresno very appealing, that and to be closer than 4 hours away. BBQ Bacon burger that has burnt ends with perfectly rendered fat (Easily best burger I've ever had), brisket quesadilla, and pulled pork Nachos...this place can do no wrong.

Id take the long way around to Bishop if it meant visiting Westwoods more often.

And the peppercorn bbq sauce is the perfect mix of steak sauce meets bbq sauce

Thank you Beth and Ally again!!<//Text>< Pics>

This restaurant is my favored. I visit a lot of restaurants but to this one I go the most. The team is very affectionate and the cuisine they place on your table is so yummy. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner in this place. Highly recommended.</Text>

The sides I got with my tri tip were so so but the tri tip was top quality. The potato skins as an appetizer were delicious. Outdoor seating was set up good for dealing with corona, they were prepared.</text>

<review>I've enjoyed many things on the menu, but the burnt ends are by far my favorite. They make me feel like I'm back in KC eating some Q39 with my buddies. The sides are pretty much all great, but the slaw is just a huge change from normal bbq slaw. It's a crispy and slightly sweet crunch with the fresh apple in it. The beans are my other favorite side too. They have a nice smoky flavor packed with bacon!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Waited 1 hour and 45 mins before we even recieved a glass of water, meanwhile people all over were ordering, eating and leaving. the restaurant WAS NOT AT CAPACITY OR EVEN FULL.  Piss poor service, food was cold and undercooked. After I complained we were given soggy carrot cake "on the house"... NEVER AGAIN</Review>

<review>I had lunch at the bar. The Korean BBQ salad with chicken breast. The meal was great and the service was nice and professional. I asked for a little extra dark greens on the salad and received it just so. Sweet potato fries were good too. A little pricey but you're getting the ambience. I'll be back for sure!<//review>< pics>

My salad had brown peices throughout the entire thing. The nachos were bland and extremely low on any kind of the stated toppings. Definitely not worth the money. I will say that their Blue Cheese was the one ,and unfortunately only, impressive flavor in what I tasted. Outside of the food, the staff was very friendly and our server was outstanding.<//review><Gmap_id>0x8094681fdf08c649:0xc524985a70250488<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

I've enjoyed many things on the menu, but the burnt ends are by far my favorite. They make me feel like I'm back in KC eating some Q39 with my buddies. The sides are pretty much all great, but the slaw is just a huge change from normal bbq slaw. It's a crispy and slightly sweet crunch with the fresh apple in it. The beans are my other favorite side too. They have a nice smoky flavor packed with bacon!<//Review>

I had made reservations for our group of 15.  What magnificent service!  Our placement within the restaurant was perfect, not crowded nor "in the corner".  Our waitress was fun, kind, accommodating,  and she enhanced our gathering.
The food was wonderful, as always.
I will use them again for our group luncheons.< /text>

<Text>Cannot rave about this place enough!!! Went here with several colleagues, had the grilled artichoke, cornbread, burnt tips, calamari all of which were outstanding. I had the black and blue tri tip and boy howdy if it wasn’t worth fighting over. It was cooked to perfection, the scalloped potatoes were so delicious and the grilled cabbage was just perfectly executed. Then came the super fantastic strawberry pizza, think cheesecake but thin and addicting.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

The staff was very friendly. Great atmosphere.  Not sure why, but our waitress was a little slow with our service. Our sandwich rolls for the pulled pork and pastrami were hard as a rock, practically inedible.  Pulled pork was a little dry and also had a funny taste that could be covered up with the honey q sauce that was delicious. Sweet potato fries are the worst I've ever had. Pit Brisket nachos had a funny taste that was hard to narrow down. It may have been the green salsa. Everything about the tri tip sandwich was amazing. Watermelon Jalepeno Margarita was delicious. Our total bill was around $170 for 4 people. On the patio the tables  are very small and chairs are uncomfortable.  Visited July 8th during covid-outdoor dining and take out only. Masks were not required by patrons. Seating was a spaced a good distance apart. Servers and staff wore masks and/or face shields and gloves.< /Text>

super delicious food here! We tried almost every kind of meat and everybody loved it. The portions were generous and we ended up taking home enough to have another meal. A little bit on the slow side for service on Sunday but it was really busy here.</Text>

Since it has re-opened because of the COVID-19 it seems like the quality of the food has gone down I have been there twice and both times been very disappointed in the food. The service was good it’s just the food that was disappointing. Before the COVID-19 I used to go there all the time I love their food not so much anymore.

Our waiter, Austin, completely ruined our lunch. He seemed uninviting, didn’t greet us, wasn’t very helpful or resourceful, and lacked the skill of time management. He quickly asked us if our food was fine as he walked by on his way to another table without ever stopping. We were overall very unpleased with his attitude. It made us feel completely unwanted. However, the rest of the staff seemed amazing & the food was delicious. We will definitely return but I’d recommend that if you get Austin you ask to get a new waiter. It’ll definitely save you some frustration!< /text>

<Review>Great food, reasonable prices, great service! This place is almost always busy, and reservations are a good idea at lunch or dinner time. Great variety on the menu, but the cheesy jalapeño cornbread is a must-try appetizer!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm from TX, well not now, I moved back to CA.  Having enjoyed real TX BBQ at Peacan Lodge, Franklin's, Hard Eight, and Hutchings Westwoods is under a lot of pressure to deliver.
They were ok, and I applaud their efforts,  but table service is not how you experience BBQ in my humble opinion. If they're proud of their BBQing then their meats need to be on display for all to see.  I know another TX telling CA BBQers they don't know what they're doing!  Well the truth can be harsh, but TX BBQ is soooooo delicious! I'll be back as my Son in law loves their Tri tip.
Enjoy< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>Pretty good bbq. The steamed broccoli was undercooked, but the scalloped potatoes and ribs made up for it. The ribs were light on meat, but the waiter immediately noticed and gave me extra ribs without me having to say anything.

<text>Our waiter, Austin, completely ruined our lunch. He seemed uninviting, didn’t greet us, wasn’t very helpful or resourceful, and lacked the skill of time management. He quickly asked us if our food was fine as he walked by on his way to another table without ever stopping. We were overall very unpleased with his attitude. It made us feel completely unwanted. However, the rest of the staff seemed amazing & the food was delicious. We will definitely return but I’d recommend that if you get Austin you ask to get a new waiter. It’ll definitely save you some frustration!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

The food was good.  I feel the portion of the salmon should be little bit bigger for the price you pay for it. Our server was very nice and on top of everything.  (Jessica) Great job...< /text>

We had a family dinner here for my mom and husband birthday and really enjoyed ourselves. Cody our server was amazing super funny, cody was always coming by and checking on us and making suggestions that were fantastic, at one point cody read my mind and brought me something before I could even ask for it. We will be going back because the food was fabulous never had a better steak, the potatoes were sent from heaven and the drinks were so original but I'm hoping we get cody next time cause he was the best.</Text>

Your Plank Salmon was inedible! It was like salmon jerky, very very chewy and salty.
Side of cole slaw had a couple of tablespoons in the container. I would have ordered a different side if you were running low.
Not ordering take out from here anymore.</review>

<text>Had lunch Friday with life long friends.  The service was absolutely terrible slow and had to ask for everything.  My club sandwich was tasteless cold and not seasoned. My friends had soggy salads and a cold burger!   Was so disappointed as other times it was fun.  Having to run down your server/ as she said I will be helping at the bar be back when I can - really doesn’t work for me!!! Was not a good experience..</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Review>This place has really gone down hill. I used to come here when it first opened for some of the best BBQ and drinks. Over time this place has changed ingredients, portions, and processes to the point of where the food is sub par and the drinks are more filler and less bang for the buck. I really hate to say it... I will not be coming back. 😕<//Review>< gmap_id>

Tri tip was awesome. Mushroom rice knocked my socks off. Potato salad was so good. You can taste fresh cut dill in it. It was perfect. The staff was very professional.</review>

<Text>I really liked Their Meat, the 1st time but the next 2 were just Ok and Their Sides aren't all that Great there's not a very Diverse Selection and they are very Small Portioned. We've Visited 3 Times each time was well over a $100 and in the End I'm left Unfulfilled like something was a Miss. I highly Doubt We'll return to this Establishment.<//Text>< pics>

Here in Fresno Ca, there aren't any matches to Westwoods BBQ in flavor they offer the best tasting steak and tri-tip. It's a busy restaurant from open to close because the food is the best. Worth the wait but you can make a reservation.< /review>

I went there tonight for my birthday.  Got there at 10 minutes to 6.  Waited until 6:30 to get a table.
So we sat 10 minutes and  our server came her name was Hannah, she took our drink order and brought us ice tea.  We sat another half hour till finally some one.  Couldn't tell you who, took our order.  Needless to say by 8 we still had not been served.  Not even my salad!  So we got up and left at 8:15 without anything to eat.  Hannah did stop and ask someone did take your order.  Back and forth she went.  The table next to us sat down 30 minutes after us and had their side dish.  Too bad!  I'm quite disgusted!
Thanks Westwood for a great birthday!   NOT!</Review>

Food was good. I would hav given four stars, but service wasn't that good. Never got my extra condiments for my baked potatoe. And other people in my party also lacked items. Will probably not go on a Saturday night again.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>My first visit to Westwood was great. I had the tri tip sandwich for lunch with side of fries. The tri-tip was the BEST I have ever had, and I have had a lot of tri tip! It was 2:00 PM, so not busy, but still pretty lively with the local Fresno crowd. My server Ashley was great even with me getting a business call right in the ordering process. I hope to go back again, as I am from So-Cal< /review>< Pics>

<Text>If there was a better place, let me know! This place is outrageous, pure and simple. Hubby & I both had the Feast plate, $21.00, each. Had 3 BBQ meats, baked beans, cream corn (which I love, different then what you see in a can but I'm sure you can switch that out) Cole slaw, and fries to die for! Decorated cute inside. Gas outside patios also. We each ate half of our meals and can't wait for tomorrow night!! Lol Oh wait! He had banana pudding, OMG, and I had carrot cake. Note picture, flippin' HUGE, had 2 bites, took great home. Could feed 4 easily!! It was a "mike drop"!!< /Text></record>

<review>Tried to take my wife out on a date, got to Westwoods at 8:30 pm on Tuesday, a little late.  The store said it was open until 9:00 but no one would greet us, multiple servers and even a manager looked at us but didn't come over. I guess they close earlier, or just didn't want to serve us. We waited for about 10 minutes at the front desk, no one even  greeted us and said they were closed, we were just ignored.

So we left and went to LAZY DOG across the street for the first time and it was Great! I recommend the Calamari appetizer it was awesome, with the Thai Chicken Salad.  Service was really nice, the best server we've had in a long time, Bryan.  He was training, but went above and beyond, great person to have for our first time.

Skip the cold shoulder at Westwoods, they don't want customers apparently, and go to Lazy Dog, that's my recommendation.< /review>< pics>

<Review>This place never disappoints me. Other than awesome food, Westwood's has a great atmosphere. In my opinion, the bar is bigger than most. The service is good as well. Some of their best dishes I have had are their burnt ends and honey q fried chicken. That honey q sauce is amazing!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8094681fdf08c649:0xc524985a70250488</gmap_id></record>

<text>Definetly recommend Westwoods!  The service could have been better though.  Part of the order was forgotten and didn't arrive until the meal was over.  My burger was undercooked, but after being rectified, I was able to enjoy the best burger I've ever eaten!  We did have a wonderful time and the food was excellent!</text><user_name>Kelly R.

<review>Love their food!! So many choices on their menu. Each time we have visited the staff is awesome. I highly recommend reservations, especially for special occasions like Mother's Day. The wait can be long on busy weekends. Even with reservations we have waited up to 30 minutes for a table but definitely worth the wait!!<//review>< resp>

I ordered the sampling platter, comes with 2 ribs, fried chicken, tri tip, and 4 small sides. Baked beans are lighter than most. Even with bacon, they have lots of tomato and onion and much less molasses like some other recipes I've seen. He tri-tip was by far the best meat. Soft and succulent, meaty and smoky. The BBQ sauces (regular and pepper) were thick and viscous without being too sweet<//review>

<Text>This place never disappoints me. Other than awesome food, Westwood's has a great atmosphere. In my opinion, the bar is bigger than most. The service is good as well. Some of their best dishes I have had are their burnt ends and honey q fried chicken. That honey q sauce is amazing!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Very unprofessional workers
So the waitress who served my and my bf was not very professional with her job she charged me for my food but didn’t charge my boyfriend which I don’t appreciate because if she’s not going to charge him for his extra sides she shouldn’t be charging me for mine. I don’t think I would be here again with the waitresses giving discounts to my boyfriend and not to me. Very unprofessional..</Text>< Pictures>

I have been to Westwood's a few times. I've never been disappointed, but since I discovered the beef ribs, I have been converted. I know they pride themselves on the tritip. That's fine. It's good. But few places do beef ribs right, and this is one of them. I even wrote a poem about it.<//review>

<text>Westwood's BBQ was a very busy place today. Long wait; 35-45 minutes.
It has a cabin, rustic, Mason jar lights atmosphere. And large TVs to watch sports on.  It's actually rather nice.
The food was delicious and our waitress was a wonderful young lady who was quite helpful when helping us order and a fantastic server. Remember, when you go, it can be busy on the weekends as it's a popular eatery here in Fresno.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>This place is AWESOME.  It can get pretty busy so if your going to dinner make a reservation especially if you have a large group.  I got the burnt ends they were good but there grilled chicken is also very good. If I where you though I would get the ribs, I liked all of them the sampler is a good one to get.  Also lunch is less busy with no waiting. They have buffet and Al a carte</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0vRMgBnBFJLj57aGMsOtnVJDEOUR409AadBBj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtwmhg-pFjqY3Ebdv2PvhZQa1bvnt97fo-kM_S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x8094681fdf08c649:0xc524985a70250488</Gmap_id>< Rate>

Great food...honestly...its so good that dinner time can be a lil tricky gettin a waitress to refill water or ice tea..i think if they had 1 seperate fountain for free water/sweet tea refills it lessen the workload 4 the hardworking busy waiters/waitresses. Its a good wait for the food. It be good ol southern hospitality 2 not hav2 wait for water or tea refill.</Text>

I was very disappointed with my lunch today. I ordered 2 beef ribs with a salad. When the order came the 2 beef ribs looked like pork ribs size wise and didn’t have 5oz of meat total. For the price it was not even average..
Shame on you !</Text>

All tasty, no issues but what I mentioned. I feel I get my moneys worth. I had to take portions home, got full fast. We both love the white chicken chili, get it each time we go.

I had the tri-tip with ribs, green beans, and Mac/cheese. I LOVED everything but the green beans—idk why they put tomatoes in them but ok. 😖 I sent it back and asked for cream corn (can’t mess that up right). Well yes you can. Lol I just had a caesar salad as my 2nd side. I would go back tho!<//Review>

Marvelous experience. On a Sat. Evening after shopping, we only waited, at the most  6 min. Our server was on top of everything, had a great attitude even after I asked about a serving size..she promptly brought a proper sized serving. Our food was fantastic and my 2 guests said it was the best food they had eaten in many moons. KUDOs to the staff. Thankyou.<//Text>

Went for company meeting. Food was ok nothing to brag about for sure. We're from the mid west and we know bbq this is not it. Want to be bbq joint with upscale attitude doesn't work. Focus on the food and getting it right. I ordered brisket and burnt ends both were dry. Ask to replace my food with something else and it wasn't much better won't be returning anytime soon.</Text>

<Review>This is the trendy lunch spot that everyone goes to. Their tri tip is my fav. Tried the St Louis ribs. Meaty but just okay. Not necessarily fatty but not the rib I expected. Mac n cheese is just okay so I'd go with the mashed potatoes. Their salads are good and popular as well. If going with a large group for lunch definitely call ahead. They get busy.<//Review>< pics>

You'll never catch me ordering another steak from there, if I do ever go back.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>The loud and casual atmosphere is great with kids. Obviously not the best restaurant choice for a vegan, but I was there for a family member's birthday dinner. I was happy to see at least one salad without meat or dairy and of course, a plain baked potato or fries.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have been to Westwood's a few times. I've never been disappointed, but since I discovered the beef ribs, I have been converted. I know they pride themselves on the tritip. That's fine. It's good. But few places do beef ribs right, and this is one of them. I even wrote a poem about it.Thank you Westwood's! For someone as picky I am, with as specific of cravings as I become prisoner to,</review></record>

<review>We were disappointed with our dinner. Wife has been to K.C. recently and craved bbq ribs.   The smoke aroma and the decoration was the best part of the experience.
My tri-tip burnt ends had a good bbq/smoke flavor, but I thought 50% fat was excessive. Waiter was friendly when present, but only refilled 2 of 5 our party’s glasses once during our visit. Scalloped potatoes were baked so long that it could have been mashed potatoes from last night for all I know. The green beans were lightly blanched and just okay as the bacon was waterlogged. Chocolate cake is subjective. It’s extremely sweet if you like that. Not trying to hate, but definitely feel I would rather eat at Dickies even if was the same price.</review>< Pics>

We arrived about 5pm and were seated right away however it was at least five minutes or longer before our server arrived to greet us and bring us menus
The jalapeno cornbread appetizer is delicious and the small is perfect for 4 persons to share.
We also ordered the house margarita with salt on the rocks and it was all ice and about 3 sips of actual margarita... not worth it in my opinion.
Pulled pork, braised cabbage and sweet potato mash was excellent,  spare ribs, salmon flat bread, were good but the fries were way too salty,  and the apple celery slaw was pretty tasteless. Meal for 4 with one drink and one appetizer was $65 before tip.< /Review>

Came to Westwoods with my cousin. Told him he will have the best ribs he ever had. He agreed with me, and said next time he is in Fresno Westwoods will be the place to go. Everyone was so nice and helpful. Great servers.
Came another time on crutches and staff gave us seats near the door so I didn't have to walk so far. Can't wait to come back again.< /text>

<review>The customer service was decent, the food was nice, I had the baby back and St. Louis ribs they were tender flavorful and the right amount of sauce, but what really took it there for me was their mushroom fries and watermelon lemonade.

< Review>
I had eaten at this place a few years before and had a great experience. In fact, I had often thought back about the delicious meal and found my mouth watering as I reminisced about the juicy, cooked to perfection tritip Westwood is known for. Upon moving back to Fresno, my excitement grew as my daughter and I headed back for our expected first of many trips to  the beloved restaurant. We settled into our booth, she with her gin and tonic, l with my martini, hungrily awaiting that first bite of meat. I cut into mine and was sorely disappointed. Where was the pink? I had ordered mine medium rare! My daughter's was beautiful; mine was well done! I called over our adorable waiter, Cody, who explained to me that all the trips were cooked the same-medim. Well then, where the heck did my daughter's beautiful medium rare slices come from? To be generous, Cody offered me a new piece of meat, which was brought to the table by a different gentleman who promised a free piece of dessert as a consolation. I cut into the new piece and unfortunately found it to be of the same doneness as the first, only this one also had a large vein of fat running all the way down the middle. I was no longer in the mood for meat, but my carrots were superb! The free dessert, carrot cake tasted like it had been sitting for too long exposed, rather dry, but the gesture was nice. Frankly, however, I think my meal should have been comped! Cody, our waiter, by the way, was a gem! His service could not have been any better!</Review>

I normally love going to Westwoods but the last two times I've gone I've been very disappointed in both the service and the food.  Tonight's meal looked like someone got to it first.  My chicken strip was ripped into two and looked like there was a piece missing. The chicken thigh had a chunk missing from the skin. My sweet potato mash was very greasy. I didn't want to send back my food because we waited a very long time to get our food, it was slow we were able to notice that our waiter was standing around at the counter a lot and walking to unoccupied tables completely ignoring our table. When he finally came to our table he noticed my drink was empty but didn't refill it.</Text>

I had a California burger, very good. It had Jack cheese, avocado, crispy onions, arugal and a cilantro aioli. Wow. My husband had the Santa Maria tri tip. Quite possibly the best tri to we've had. It just melted in your mouth! I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will make a return trip when back in town again!<//Text>

The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. The food was spectacular. I've never personally been to a southern bbq restaurant but I would definently saw west woods could compete. I had the lunch platter with Nebraska beef ribs. I got four ribs and two sides for 24 dollars. The sides could have been bigger but they were delicious. Mac n cheese and potato salad very good.</review>

We made reservations and still waited over 20 mins.  So don't go there expecting to eat anytime soon. Our food took over an hour to get to our table. When it finally did, it was amazing. Enjoy< /Review>

I like the food ok, first time there and had a lot of menu items to choose from. I had burnt ends and it was not like any I had before, the bbq sauce they put on them did not compliment the meat. Reasonable price for a restaurant in California. Service was good,  cornbread was extra cost but was very tasty.</Review>

< Review>
Ordered turkey melt and chicken chili. I couldn't finish; food was too salty. I experienced the excess salt twice before with the beans that come with the barbecue. I was hoping the salt problem was not an everyday occurrence. Boy, was I wrong! The only reason for the 2 stars is that the server was compassionate and gracious.</Review>

<Text>My wife and I are not fans of pork, but we love ribs. Westwoods is the only place that I know of in town that has some huge BEEF ribs. All 4 of us got the beef rib plates. They offer them in 2, 3 and 4 rib combos with 2 sides. Make sure you ask for the warm wet towels as big ribs can get a little messy. They'll bring you a small plate with 2 damp, steaming towels to keep your hands and face clean.</Text><time>1525980906722</time>< Gmap_id>

<review>I have eaten there 2 other times and the pork spare ribs were very day I  Did not care for them. My nephew wanted to try it out for his first  time. We order brisket burnt ends. When we receive our orders I had to send my back I couldn't believe how much fat was on our plate of meat. The second try was not any better. Couldn't eat it so much fat.  Will not go back again</review>< gmap_id>

Great food.  Great atmosphere.  Great servers.  It's a bit pricey for a " family" restaurant, so be ready.  Also, there can be long waits to be seated; bring a book!</Review>

<review>Stopped in for an early dinner/late lunch. I just got the tail end of their lunch pricing and the beginning of happy hour. sweet. I was a party of 1 so I sat at the bar. The interior has an industrial banyardy vibe with lots of metal and wood. I ordered the VIP vodka which has been sitting in pineapple. Its strong but you'd never know it. You can get it at Pismo's too.

I ordered the sampling platter, comes with 2 ribs, fried chicken, tri tip, and 4 small sides. Baked beans are lighter than most. Even with bacon, they have lots of tomato and onion and much less molasses like some other recipes I've seen. He tri-tip was by far the best meat. Soft and succulent, meaty and smoky. The BBQ sauces (regular and pepper) were thick and viscous without being too sweet.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Have eaten here 5-6 times. Ribs, tri-tip, chicken, grilled artichoke were all quite good. bought 1 bottle of each of the BBQ sauces. Last time there I decided to try a burger, big mistake! I received my food & half the burger was raw, not rare, raw. Not the center, it was like the left half of my burger, which is a little thick, looked evenly cooked on the outside. Raw! I ate my side dish, we payed our bill, left and haven't gone back since. That was 6-7 months ago.< /Text>< user_id>

<text>Atmosphere was great and drinks were really good, now here comes the part that ruined the whole experience, I ordered the dry aged rib eye and thought for almost 40 bucks that this would be a real treat. Well as i cut into this old fallen pasture cow I soon realized this would be my last trip here. Good luck everyone else<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I've had mixed experiences here but now that I've gone a few times I've figured out what I like on the menu. The smell alone is amazing and the service seems to be on it.< /text>

The Nashville chicken sandwich was to die for, and don't forgot to get the extra garlic on your fries . Worth the extra $2.</Text>

This place is delicious !! I'm so full I got the pork nachos $7. And my bf got a burger with fries it was about $10 we couldn't eat anymore !! Service was awesome . It's hard to find service like this . Restaurant is big and​ spacious. Definitely coming here again. Mashila was our server super friendly above and beyond.😍<//text>

They also have their own signature BBQ sauces and they are great, the peppercorn BBQ sauce is hands down my favorite and you can also by jars of it so you can have the great flavor of westwoods right in your own kitchen.

Went in for lunch with my family, my 2 year old daughter was saying hello to our waitress when she finally showed up to greet us, and she ignored my daughter giving her an oddly rude smirk! We placed our drink order for the bar, it took a good 15-20 minutes and then the waitress placed our drinks on the empty table behind us. Then she went and got napkins for another table,  tea refills for another table, then finally got the tray to bring us the drinks we were starring at! I've been in the restaurant industry for 15 years and she was not very busy! When our food arrived I had to get up to go get napkins and silverware for our table! Luckily the food was good because the service was awful!<//Text>

Waitress dropped a container of cream for my coffee on the floor and cream went everywhere.  The cream stained my good pants. My shoes were also covered in cream. My wife's shoes got a little splatter. The waitress then moved my wife and myself to another table because the floor around out table was covered in cream.  The waitress forgot all about us and we had to ask another waitress for service.  Regarding the cheeseburger I ordered, I hated it. Way too much seasonings. All I tasted was garlic and salt. I brought the leftover burger home to my dog and she ate it but she will eat anything. I ordered pulled pork on fries as an appetizer and the sauce had a nasty flavor. Too many jalepeno peppers. I must have picked out a cup of peppers. If I was the manager I would have offered a comp but nope, nothing. I will never go back to this restaurant.</text>

I gotta say so sad after the third visit for some take out this time not going back ever again after being burned got some tri tip tough as shoe leather same for the chicken medallions actually had to cut with a knife so over cooked and the sides were ridiculously small for the amount that they charge. Kinda hard to complain since living up here in the mountains o well there's gotta be others that are better like Mike's grill down the street on cedar and herndon that's my go to place quick and easy and cheaper< /Review>

Save your money, go to Dog House Grill.
I’ve been here twice and both times were a let down. Seems everyone likes the spot for atmosphere, which is actually pretty cool. But the food is not good. The fries were soggy both times. The portions did not justify the price.
The tri tip had a Smokey flavor to it which was good but honestly it wasn’t anything I couldn’t make at home.
The pulled pork tasted more like carnitas dressed in the bbq sauce which isn’t that tasty to begin with. If I want carnitas I’ll go to a Mexican restaurant or a taco truck for it. When I go to a bbq spot and order pulled pork I want pulled pork. Dog House pulled pork is so much better it’s quite embarrassing. Dog House tri tip is much better in so many ways. The tri tip here seemed more like carne Asada. Which is weird.
My wife also ordered a banana pudding but while she was eating it she noticed a garlic flavor? If they add garlic to their banana pudding so be it. But I’m pretty sure that’s not a typical ingredient in banana pudding, maybe they cross contaminated?
I’m never coming back here. It’s so hyped up with its glittery lights and fancy commercials, but all them glitters ain’t gold.

Seriously guys save your money and go to Dog House.< /Review>

There was not a long wait, but the food was horrible. The sides were not that good at all and the ribs looked like they were cooked days ago and just thrown back on the grill to be warmed up. The chicken the same way. The rice pilaf was gummy and the white chicken chili was just not good. Wouldn't go there again. It sucks because that was my birthday dinner.< /review>

We usually are happy eating at Westwoids, however this time we had a waitress that just wasn't focused. We waited a long time before a waitress appeared to take our orders, we had to ask for a steak knife, 1 order was wrong. It was a birthday dinner for 2 in the party, reservations had been made and birthdays were mentioned at reservation time, but waitress never acknowledged them. Understaffed?<//review>

I have enjoyed several meals at Westwoods. Recently, however, quality seems to have changed. Not that we are "super sized" eaters, but serving sizes have reduced (but not the prices) and bbq beef/pork menu items seem to be greasy. I love the Fatoush salad with perfectly cooked chicken but it now looks very small in the bowl compared to previous visits over the years.<//review>

We came to the restaurant on Saturday evening to celebrate Father's day.  We had a party of 10.  We were seated in a back room and we're assigned the worst waitress I have had in a long time.  She never brought some of our drinks even after repeated requests and also did not refill the drinks.  My dad's steak was near raw and when it was returned it looked like it had been stuck in the microwave.  When we told the waitress about It she scoffed at us and told us that don't even have microwaves in the kitchen. I am not dumb I know all restaurants have microwaves.  It was a bad experience and the last time we were there as a family it was one of the best meals we had eaten in a long time.  We were sorely disappointed in the experience this time.  And the best part was because we were a large party she still was paid over 50 dollars in tip money even though she gave terrible service.  She did not earn even 5 dollars that night.<//text>

<text>We came for a family member's birthday. The food was good, but we found a cockroach crawling across our table. We let our server know, and he apologized, but he didn't do anything else. We weren't asking for a free meal or anything, but it would have been nice to know that they were taking the issue seriously or doing something to rectify the situation. I was disappointed to find this issue in such a reputable establishment. I don't plan on returning.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Long wait about an hour.  Had chopped sirloin steak and so did my daudhter-in-law.  It was so raw that I could not eat it.  It almost made me want to throw up.  It looked like gushy ground round.  So our sweet precious waitresses  took it back and it was back pretty quickly.  Well the outside edges were done but the middle was still raw on both of ours.  Needless to say we ate what wasn't raw and left the huge piece that was the middle that was raw.  It was a shame because it had a fantastic flavor.  I just don't eat raw mushy hamburger meat.
My sons baby back ribs were cold when we got our food also.
I will go back when it is not so busy and I would like to try what I had tonight again but cooked right.  The flavors were great.
They did make it right to my son on the bill because the waitress did go and talk to the manager and they took off one whole dinner and half another and brought my daudhter-in-law desert to take home.  The waite staff were wonderful above and beyond.  The cooks might need a we bit of help on how to cook certain things to fully cooked, flavors were great.  Look forewarned to going back when they are not so busy.  We thought maybe them being overwhelmed with customers the cooks could not keep up and do a good job, up to their standards.< /text>< gmap_id>

The Tri-Tip and Turkey sandwich were very good -- nice and tender. The service was not as good. We showed up at 5:50 and were give the happy hour menus to order before 6:00. We finally were able to order our food. She finished at 5:59 but stated that we would NOT get the happy hour price because she would not be able to get it in before 6:00. She did not bother to check with the manager on this matter. That's fine, we did not leave a tip due to poor customer service. We used the gift card and figure we will eat at another BBQ place here in Fresno in the future.</Text>

This place has awesome tritip sandwiches! I got the tritip dip and it was amazing! They also have their own signature BBQ sauces and they are great, the peppercorn BBQ sauce is hands down my favorite and you can also by jars of it so you can have the great flavor of westwoods right in your own kitchen. The staff was friendly, the service was fast, and the beer selection magnificent! 10/10 Would eat here again!</Text>

< Review>
Westwoods BBQ is the most Amazing restaurant in Fresno.  The BBQ ribs are tender and smothered in tangy sauce just get extra napkins.  I get the ribs and shredded pork, for sandwiches to watch Sunday football.  You will not be disappointed,  try Westwood BBQ & Spice Co.today.< /Review>

It's far too expensive for the quality of food and service. The waitress messed up big time. She behaved unprofessionally and came off very rude. She let us keep an order she messed up but still charged us. Their fries are extremely salty. I wouldn't choose to come here again.<//text>

<Review>Very Good BBQ joint with nice dining area. I  gave only 4 stars due to the fact that i have had better ribs and tri tip sandwiches in this town, but the one thing about Westwoods is everything they serve is either good or great and that is rare. Strongly Recommend the build your burger with all meats, huge and delicious.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Westwoods has a great western steakhouse atmosphere and the staff were friendly and professional. Unfortunately the food fell short. The portions were huge and looked fantastic however the wedge salad dressing was flavorless. The jalepeno cornbread was grainy. The beans were sickeningly sweet. The ribs just didn't have any flavor. The best thing we had was the cedar plank salmon which was perfectly cooked and just about the best salmon I've ever had. This was the first time I've eaten here so I will probably give them another chance...< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The food is good and the service was good. Tried the trip tip sandwich and it wasn't better than anyone else in town. The BBQ sauce could be better and I think that is what makes other sandwiches in town better (cough cough..doghouse) lol<//text>

I love the Black and Bleu Tri-Tip steak. I travel to get it for lunch and dinner often.  We also like this place as a go to with the family because it's loud and casual. This is a good stop if you want a great steak in a casual enviorment. You want the same great food in a more formal steak house setting hit Fansler's Yosemite Steakhouse. He did his restaurants right.<//Text>

<date>1547329645744</date><rate>1<//rate><review>We arrived shortly after 11am. We were greeted and sat down quickly. However, we sat for over 20 minutes with no one coming to us. We started to notice the area next to us get seated/full and we saw 2 waitresses go to that area before us. Now im usually the one who gets upset with bad service, but my husband, who has worked in the hospitality and service area, was upset that others were being seated and right away being served. That was the last straw. Upon walking out I told the hostess that we had been sitting jn our area for 20 mins and had not had service but families that came after us had. there was another lady(who i assume was the manager) tried to remedy the situation, but if this service was this slow, i can only imagine how long it would have taken for food. my son at this point had been fussy, so we said we cant wait any longer due to my son and left. We went across the street and ate.
I know this review wont do anything, but Im severely disappointed. this was our first time coming here and likely our last.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

A wise man once told me, “the biggest fool has the loudest voice.” Well that statement couldnt be more true when i laid eyes.....and mostly ears, on what im assuming is a manager. A manager who has the communication and iq skills of a dried prune that was reject from a pack of SunMaid dried prunes for not being pruney enough. The wait staff has always been to par and id hire them in a minute. This manager tho......ruined it for me. To start, I hear him yelling at his employees and staff even dropping more F bombs than a sailor three sheets in the wind at happy hour. I don’t know what he was  getting angry at his staff for and i dont know the reasons, but making a scene ruined my Anniversary....yes my ANNIVERSARY! He does not seem fit to be a manager becuase he appears to lead his staff by yelling at them and leading from behind does not count. Walking frantically around the restaurant trying to look busy lol just like a high school kid. He almost reminds me of this guy i busted selling counterfit levi jeans who would talk just as loud......during the raid.... he even cried just as loud. Good food tho!</Review>

<Review>Been here a few times and the food is really good but service and Waite time are rediculous. It does not matter what time of day you go its crazy busy and no parking. Waite time is opproximately 1 hr. Service is not the greatest they won’t cook the food well done or how you want it cooked. And seating while waiting is not good at all. You’ll Waite more likely outside and it’s usually freezing. I would usually go to eat their delicious tri tip sandwich but I found a better place which I’ll now be going. For great tri tip sandwiches and ribs try Mikes Grill, I guarantee it,  you will not regret it.</Review><Rating>2</Rating></record></dataset><record>

The Tri-Tip and Turkey sandwich were very good -- nice and tender. The service was not as good. We showed up at 5:50 and were give the happy hour menus to order before 6:00. We finally were able to order our food. She finished at 5:59 but stated that we would NOT get the happy hour price because she would not be able to get it in before 6:00. She did not bother to check with the manager on this matter. That's fine, we did not leave a tip due to poor customer service. We used the gift card and figure we will eat at another BBQ place here in Fresno in the future.</text>

I was so disappointed. we went in as party of six and the only one who left satisfied was the child in the group. She has the kids ribs and fries. The steak was dry, steamed veggies were cold, and the baked beans tasted too much like hot beer! Way overpriced for "bland".<//Review>

I love the Black and Bleu Tri-Tip steak. I travel to get it for lunch and dinner often.  We also like this place as a go to with the family because it's loud and casual. This is a good stop if you want a great steak in a casual enviorment. You want the same great food in a more formal steak house setting hit Fansler's Yosemite Steakhouse. He did his restaurants right.</review>

There BBQ is mouth watering delicious. I love tri tip and their tri tip sandwich is so tender. Their craft beer on tap is very plentiful. They do have a kids section. Portions are just right. The only downside is that this place can get busy.< /review>

We arrived shortly after 11am. We were greeted and sat down quickly. However, we sat for over 20 minutes with no one coming to us. We started to notice the area next to us get seated/full and we saw 2 waitresses go to that area before us. Now im usually the one who gets upset with bad service, but my husband, who has worked in the hospitality and service area, was upset that others were being seated and right away being served. That was the last straw. Upon walking out I told the hostess that we had been sitting jn our area for 20 mins and had not had service but families that came after us had. there was another lady(who i assume was the manager) tried to remedy the situation, but if this service was this slow, i can only imagine how long it would have taken for food. my son at this point had been fussy, so we said we cant wait any longer due to my son and left. We went across the street and ate.
I know this review wont do anything, but Im severely disappointed. this was our first time coming here and likely our last.<//review>

Wonderful . Simply wonderful.  We came in during there grand opening week and have now had several birthday parties and events there. The service is always on time , servers are courteous , in the 40 + times we have visited ,we have only had a long wait time twice.
Some of our favorite dishes are the brisket , burnt ends , grilled chicken , and of course their world famous Tri Tip . All the meat is full of flavor and can stand alone with or without meat . The brisket quesadilla is the best appetizer by far ! Don't forget the strawberry pizza !!!< /review>

<review>I was so disappointed. we went in as party of six and the only one who left satisfied was the child in the group. She has the kids ribs and fries. The steak was dry, steamed veggies were cold, and the baked beans tasted too much like hot beer! Way overpriced for "bland".<//review><response>None< /response>< date>

We came in during there grand opening week and have now had several birthday parties and events there. The service is always on time , servers are courteous , in the 40 + times we have visited ,we have only had a long wait time twice.
Some of our favorite dishes are the brisket , burnt ends , grilled chicken , and of course their world famous Tri Tip . All the meat is full of flavor and can stand alone with or without meat . The brisket quesadilla is the best appetizer by far ! Don't forget the strawberry pizza !!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Be sure to try the honey Q sauce and the cream corn OH-Ya! Gettin hungry thinking about it.</Review>< pictures>

Stopped here on our way back to Bakersfield from Yosemite.  The place was jammed on a Wednesday night,  25 min wait for a table for two.  No big deal stood at the bar and had a beer with my lady.  We were seated in a booth near the kitchen which I liked because I could see all the food going in and out.  They have a huge staff and they are on top of their game from what I saw.  After talking to our waiter about the questions I had and receiving his recommendations, I went with the Santa Maria tri tip( Medium rare) with the jumbo shrimp. Sweet potato mash and steamed broccoli for sides.  The tri tip was cooked exactly to my likely and it’s seasoning was excellent.  Sides were also great.  The shrimp were good not great but my attention was on the tri tip and It was quite possibly the best I’ve ever had.  Also a solid glass of Pinot noir for 8 dollars to pair with the tri tip.  The only compliant I could render was that our waiter forgot our salad we ordered to split between the two of us to start and we already had our entrees when I told him.  Once I let him know he quickly brought it out and let me know we were not being charged for it.  That’s how you do business!  Overall great experience I would return in a heartbeart.

Ps.  My lady loved the look of the place and the exposed wooden beams.<//text>

<Review>I felt like they were trying to hide mediocre food under way too much salt & cracked pepper.  On a previous visit, I ordered a large steak, au-gratin potatoes and a salad.  The salad arrived wilted and warm on the heated plate alongside the steak, while the potatoes arrived later in a PAPER tray.  This was a $30 meal!  Ridiculous.  By the time the server returned so that I could let them know that my salad was not acceptable, the rest of our party was halfway through eating their entrees....   Very disappointing experience.< /Review><UserId.>110618664913789058572< /UserId.><resp>{'time': 1472233845928, 'text': "Hi Jody - Thank you for posting your review.

Not a single disappointing meal here! My dad loves this place and so do I ! Real bbq and good flavor! Their peppercorn bbq sauce is delish. I’ve had their watermelon salad, babyback ribs, trip tip, chicken tenders, corn, French fries, salmon ... everything here is so good!<//Text>

1st time here. Had the tri tip sandwich, fries, coffee it was delicious. I tasted the potato salad, it wasn't flavorful. My mom n her boyfriend had the salmon on the side of salad. They both said it was okay.< /review>

Atmosphere is interesting, food is really trying to be. . .  Unfortunately the food does not live up to the space.  They are just trying too hard too be the popular kid in class and come up short.  Not terrible, but expensive for what you get.<//Text>

"Its ok." Is the best I can do for this place. All I tried was the tri tip sandwich, and to be honest I wasn't very impressed. The meat was a little on the chewy side and really didn't have much of a flavor, or if It did it was overpowered by the sauce. The bbq sauce was all of spicy sweet and vinegary, really not my cup of tea.  The bread used was a very pleasant change from the standard sandwich roll or hoagie. It was a nice ciabatta style loaf.<//Review>

<Text>Been going to Westwoods since I have moved to Fresno, and absolutely love everything about this place!  The waitress's are always nice and professional, would love it if they would wear black slacks or even pants, just my suggestion, but they are always very friendly.  The most important part, the food!  Always good, and by good I mean the best in this town as far as BBQ goes!  I stop in around 12-3 and even when it is very busy i'll wait for about 30 minutes for the food which is excellent.  Definitely my wife and I's "go to" place around here.  Keep it up guys/gals!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Horrible service. Waitress just knocked over bottle did not apologize. Workers are rude and unpatient had to wait over hour for service.  While trying to eat they were knocking around tables and chairs very unprofessional wont ever be coming to this place again. Service or price is very overrated . Extremely unhappy,  ruined our birthday celebration.< /Text><user_name>Spacebound The Team</user_name>< GmapID>

<Text>My family and I enjoy this restaurant so much. The food is so good here. Love the brisket quesadilla, out of this world good. Love happy hour here as well, great drink specials and beers. The St. Louis Ribs are also a family favorite, along with the Glorious tender scrumptous Burnt Ends. We are so lucky to have a restaurant like this here in Fresno, also try Dave Fanslers other restaurants Pismos & Yosemite Ranch, both great too!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x8094681fdf08c649:0xc524985a70250488<//Gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate><Time>1578158234651< /Time><Name>CINDY DRURY< /Name><response>None</response>< userid>

Tri-Tip Dip was really good. Tender and served medium and lots of meet. I had to take some meet out so I could eat it. Bistro salad is awesome.</Review>

We went on a Saturday without a reservation so we had a wait of about 25 minutes.  The food was excellent and the prices are reasonable.< /Review>

<Review>OMG!!! this place was fantastic. We went for Dinner on Sunday and the boyfriend had the Beast Plate and I had Tri-tip with Ribs with Scallop Potatoes and Corn. We ordered the Jalepeno Cornbread with the Honey butter.  This actually has the corn kernals in it and was melt in your mouth yummy.  The ribs were excellent and meaty. The tri tip was again melt in your mouth cooked to perfection.  Scallop Potatoes were so good felt like my mom had cooked them. I can't say enough about my boyfriends Beast plate that had everything. Ribs, Chicken Strips that were so meaty that one was plenty and the beans were even good and I don't care for beans but these were superb. The mustard ssuce was to die for.  Cant wsit to go back.< /Review><time>1530216062452</time>< GmapID>

It was very busy for fathers day but our hearts were set on having westwoods.. so we waited but our time went off at exactly the 45 minutes.. wait we had I got the grilled chicken medallions with white chicken chilli and mac n cheese with Texas toast! I was very impressed with our server I should have asked her name ..she set my plate down and stopped and said this chicken does not look like what you requested it's well done and does not look to westwoods standards may I ask for another for you? I was immediately impressed! Even though I was pressed for time I said yes please!she immediately brought one over and it was delicious cooked perfectly I love the toast dipped in bbq sauce!  it was all awesome ! Thanks westwoods</review>

Went to Westwoods BBQ on a dinner date. The atmosphere was very relaxed and cosy, the food was excellent though the portions were somewhat small for the price but overall a pleasant dining experience...< /text>

The food  is good but the girls at the hostage stand do not listen. I asked for a 4 person booth and after waiting 1/2 hour for what they said would be 10 minutes that take me to a table  I  told her I don't understand why when I ask for a booth they don't listen.they really need to listen to the customer<//review>

<review>"Its ok." Is the best I can do for this place. All I tried was the tri tip sandwich, and to be honest I wasn't very impressed. The meat was a little on the chewy side and really didn't have much of a flavor, or if It did it was overpowered by the sauce. The bbq sauce was all of spicy sweet and vinegary, really not my cup of tea.  The bread used was a very pleasant change from the standard sandwich roll or hoagie. It was a nice ciabatta style loaf.<//review>< Time>

Always enjoy the flavors of this place. Atmosphere and drinks but I am always Disappointed Everytime with cold sides. It's as if they plate everything before the meats ready so it gets cold.</Text>

<review>Okay barbecue. I did like the burnt ends but it seems like the quality is going down a bit. The sides though are quite disappointing. It's also quite expensive. You can get much better BBQ, way better sides, at a much lower price at he BBQ chain that just opened around the corner.< /review>< Date>

Great barbeque from established restraunteur David Fansler (formerly Tahoe Joe's; currently Yosemite Ranch, Pismo's) known for great service, atmosphere, and wood smoked BBQ. The only negative I have for the location is the seating: the main dining area is massive and more akin to a cafeteria in terms of the volume of customers it can service. Being a popular location, expect swaths of people seated closely to one another and enjoying some great food.a<//review>

Went there tonight with close friends to celebrate a birthday.  Made reservations in advance for a party of 7.  We were seated immediately upon arrival (but then again, it was 5:30 on a Monday night).

We arrived a little early and I asked the waiter if they had Happy Hour margaritas.  He said he would have to ask.  Why he said that, I don't know because their recording when i called for reservations clearly gave the time for happy hour which ends at 6:00 p.m. (it was probably ~5:25).

Got that cleared up and had my happy hour margarita.  Was good.  Ordered the chips with tri-tip, also good.

Party arrived and we all ordered.  I think most everyone was happy with their meals but you have to keep in mind that 3 in my party of 7 were young men in the their twenties who were easy to please with free beer & food.  They had ZERO complaints.

My friend and his wife said they were happy with their meals, and since they were guest I will try to just take it at face value.

My wife ordered baby back ribs with salad and I ordered their 14 oz rib eye steak with salad.  They had a blurb on the menu about how their beef is aged for 28 days, etc... and so you're expecting something kinda special for the $27 bucks you're paying.

I've eaten steaks from SaveMart that were much better than the one I was served.  It was simply a tough steak.  I didnt even eat it all -- and that's not how I generally roll with a steak   On the positive side I ordered it medium rare and they did a pretty good job on the cooking (maybe a bit more towards medium than the  rare).

My wife's ribs were dry.

When we arrived home my wife commented that she would not choose to return there in the future.  So... it will not be a future destination of choice for us.
___
I give it 3 stars because everyone else (besides the wife and I) seemed satisfied enough.  If it were just my wife and I --> it would give it 2 stars because the salads were good.</text>

<Review>Good ribs, though a bit pricy for the amount of food. Waiters were inattentive and getting anything from them was a bit slow. Fries and nachos are good, fried chicken was okay but tasted like chinese five spice.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Great bbq joint, great menu and a great beer selection. We liked how casual and laid back it is. Worth the drive from Visalia.</Text>

Food was cold after the 45 minutes spend waiting. After being returned It was again brought out, only colder. I was not rude nor mean to my waitress but how is such a thing even possible? It felt like i was being pranked. I just ate the cornbread that came with the chilli then left. Wish i had had the opportunity to actually eat the warm food i had ordered. Would not recommend.< /Text>

My favorite restaurant! It is impossible for me to choose what to eat. we have been around 20 times since they opened.   Every time my wife and I go we try something new.(or try to, its hard to resist the tri-tip) For appetizers,  try the corn on the cobb. Our favorite meats are the tri-tip and the deep pit beef. I had my birthday there and will again. Keep it up guys!</text>

Was disapointed.. The food was good, but way too expensive for the quality/type of food. It appears they spent too much on the building and upcharge the customers for typical buffet quality food. I won't be going back..</text>

Was disapointed.. The food was good, but way too expensive for the quality/type of food. It appears they spent too much on the building and upcharge the customers for typical buffet quality food. I won't be going back..< /Review>

First time visitor,
Food was delicious, too many T.V.'s, very loud and one show that I did not need.

To my disbelief there was a child who walked across one of the shared tables four times. At one point the child was lying across the table playing with the parent’s phone and kicking his feet like this was just a normal day lying around at home. This is not something one is prepared to see in any restaurant. Our server Dean was less than enthusiastic about dealing with the event. After some intense prodding and mentioning that this was an unsanitary practice I convinced him to get the manager. Only after I complained loudly and repeatedly did the patrons who shared the table with this atrocious family and are only six inches from the child walking and lying on their table, actually complain to Dean the server who looked to have the same level of enthusiasm about dealing with the event. When the busser came to clean the table I informed him about the event and suggested that the tablecloth should be changed. After the horrified look left his face he promptly removed the tablecloth. At least one employee recognized that this is unacceptable behavior.

The worst part is that the child's father was laughing and making a joke about the entire event.

I traveled a long way to try this restaurant for my birthday and I doubt I would make the trip again.

I do have one other regret; I did not get a photo or video of this horrific event.

Sincerely,
Mortified in Hanford CA</text>

< Review>
I was treated to a birthday dinner by my boyfriend. I love BBQ. I ordered the burnt tips brisket with the potato salad and green beans. It was some of the best brisket I've had, ( and I lived in Texas for 5 years before) i do not know what our final total was. But it was good. My drink on the other hand i was dissapointed with. I order basically a piña colada. It was served to me on with ice, so it was watered down quick, and i did not taste any liquor in it... I ordered a 2nd but blended this time, and all i could taste was liquor. I wasn't expecting dessert. But the waitress offered it since it was my birthday... She never returned with whatever she said she would bring me, and just returned with the check.. She was nice. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and said she got preoccupied with other folks. Other than that. My food was delicious!<//Review>

<Date>1488944107251< /Date><Text>I see the commercials almost every day, it looked really good and most of the reviews I read were good so me and my wife decided to try it, we ordered the Grilled Artichokes and Onion rings for appetizers, the Artichokes were good but really oily and the onion rings were also full of oil , now onto our meals, my wife got the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and coleslaw and I got the Beef and Pork rib combo with a Ceasar salad, well the Potato salad was one of the worst we have had the coleslaw wasn't like any coleslaw we ever had , as for mine first the salad was wrong which the waitress cough just before she put it on the table so she took it back when I did get my right food the Ribs were cold and there was about a 1/4 " of seasoning on the beef ribs so my first bight was a big mouthfull of seasoning plus the cold fat, "NASTY" Needles to say we WON'T go back.<//Text><userid>111233481089003226920< /userid>< Name>

<Review>Good B.B.Q, except for the sauces aren't great at all.  Not to have good sauce is like not having bread with my PB.J.< /Review>< Rating>

I have been going there since the FIRST DAY and have never had a bad meal. The white chili beans is a KEEPER...the pulled pork plate, and the ribs. Dave Fansler is on site alot and such a personable guy. I also go to PISMOs alot including the Seafood Special Dinner...what an experience at both restaurants. Do yourself a favor and go yesterday....ASAP.</review>

Tri-tip dip was just what it should be. Great selection of local brews. Server was friendly, knew the beers and around when I needed him. Expensive but worth every penny.< /text>

< review>
The BBQ is decent for an urban restaurant. Definitely not as satisfying as a true southern style meal. I had the tri-tip it was a little tough and over cooked but still enjoyable. Great casual restaurant to go to with the fam if you dont want to be spotted a Applebee's or an inferior restaurant.</review>

Fresno owes a big "Thank you" to Dave for offering good restaurants to our town. From Willikers to Tahoe Joes to Yosemite Ranch to Pismos to Westwood BBQ, Dave has consistently been making nice restaurants with good food. Westwood BBQ is no exception.</Text>

The last 3 times we've ordered the Tri-Tip sandwich through the take out, it's been 75% fat!! The qualty, overall, has gone way down since it first opened. It seems to me they are cutting corners.</Text>

<Time>1406409051583</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Okay all of you who were raised in Fresno.....I have great news
for you.....Westwoods has created their version of the
Lesterburger!!!  I could hardly contain myself when I saw that
they had  just added this to their menu!!  I was there for lunch,
and I am hopeful that it will be included on their dinner menu as
well.  Apparently the owner, Mr. Fansler, worked at Lesterburger
growing up and has made a very close version of the original.
Oh how I have missed that burger and I can't thank Mr. Fansler
enough!
The only thing different was that they don't use finely shredded
lettuce as they did in the original, but that's the only difference.
(Remember Al Radka did their TV commercials and used to pull
the shredded lettuce out of the burger and say, "Let us eat it.")
I also must say that the bun they use at Westwoods is
delicious and better than the one used originally.
It's only been 3 days since I had this burger, and it's all I have
been talking about and thinking about.....I want to go back for
another one NOW!!!!
Please, Mr. Fansler, keep this on your menu!!!!!
BTW, service was outstanding!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The BBQ is decent for an urban restaurant. Definitely not as satisfying as a true southern style meal. I had the tri-tip it was a little tough and over cooked but still enjoyable. Great casual restaurant to go to with the fam if you dont want to be spotted a Applebee's or an inferior restaurant.< /Text>

Fresno owes a big "Thank you" to Dave for offering good restaurants to our town. From Willikers to Tahoe Joes to Yosemite Ranch to Pismos to Westwood BBQ, Dave has consistently been making nice restaurants with good food. Westwood BBQ is no exception.</Text>

My favorite restaurant ever. I've never been more satisfied by food then I have at this restaurant. Granted, I did eat the same thing both times (turkey melt). I will be back to try more of the menu.< /Review>

<Review>I have NEVER had to wait soooooo long on hold on a wed evening at 6:30 pm for a call reservation answer!!!!!!! If you are trying to call Westwood for reservation make sure you have a half hour to wait on the phone! Horrible service!

P.S. Why would any restaurant walk away from a guaranteed large party these days, maybe next time think about a possible deposit for any inconvenience if someone does not show up?</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< review>
Had an overpriced, mediocre ribeye steak and then had a dangerous encounter with a Mexican biker gang who had been dining there.  DO NOT TAKE ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT TO THIS RESTAURANT.</review>

Had we been aware of the situation we would have made sure to intervene immediately. Please, in the future if you are not comfortable with other guests or have any concerns, alert the staff so that we may address any issue before it is elevated.\n\nAs for you dinner we understand that you work hard for your money and that nothing is more frustrating than spending those dollars on what you feel is less than premium product and/or service. Please allow me every opportunity to correct your visit, I want to make things right with you. When you have a chance could you please email me your address to reviews@fanslerrestaurantgroup.com when you have a quick minute? Thank you and again I apologize for your most recent visit.

{'time': 1513665656737, 'text': 'Hello Kimberly - First off, I would like to apologize for your poor service and the mix up on your dessert. Obviously we failed you on your most recent visit. I understand how frustrating it can be to feel like you are not being heard or seen and to top it off you received the wrong items. I apologize and take total blame for this as the General Manager.\n\nPlease allow me every opportunity to correct your negative experience and win your business back. I know what its like to work hard for your money and spend it on a less than stellar experience. Please email me at reviews@fanslerrestaurantgroup.com with your name as the subject line along with some specific details of your visit so I can look into this. Thank you - Sharon Scott'}< /Resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) Too much waiting, it will be that because it is a weekend the waiters are late in getting to take the order. The next time you visit that place, do not go hungry, otherwise you will have a very bad attitude.

(Original)
Demasiada la espera, sera que por ser fin de semana los meseros están retrasados en llegar a tomar la orden. La próxima vez que visiten ese lugar no vallan con mucha hambre de lo contrario se pondrán de muy mala actitud.</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Spectacular local !! Fast and attentive service. Reasonable price-quality, we ate the ribs and they were spectacular. Local somewhat noisy, but everything else perfect. We saw that a lot of people asked to take it. On Thursdays they make special offers on dishes and drinks.
