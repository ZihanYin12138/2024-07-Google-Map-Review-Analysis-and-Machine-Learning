OMG, I asked for ham and cheese with mayo and no produce. My sandwich had hardly any ham and there was no cheese!! Cheese is NOT produce!! And they don't use real mayonnaise, it has a sweet taste, probably Miracle Whip..YUCK! 50 years they boast and it clearly has gone down hill. Skip this place and go to Sourdough & Co., instead. Seriously!</Text>

If you are looking for the perfect sandwich than look no further. Togo’s also sells their iconic Ice Cream Cakes!!! My daughter attends Adventure Cristian Academy and this has become my family’s go to spot for years. So do yourself a favor make the smart choice and don’t gamble on lunch choose Togo’s. 5 stars every time!</Review>

Do not let your trainee make sandwiches during a lunch rush... it took her 20 minutes to make 3 sandwiches. I understand she was still learning but that was ridiculously slow. Even though I repeated my toppings to her numerous times she still got it wrong. Whoever is training her needs to do a better job because the poor thing was on the struggle bus.</Text>

I have long enjoyed the Togo's variety of sandwich offerings.  Though there are also other menu items like soups and salads, the sandwiches are what I enjoy most.  To me, their pastrami(or #9, as it is mostly known), is the best and beyond comparison anywhere else!  The recent pairing of Togo's locations, under the same roof with Baskin Robbins ice cream, is a very smart, yet logical concept.  It allows patrons to enjoy either food venue by itself, or in combination.  Pricing is on par with similar sandwich shops like Subway, and offers the occasional featured sandwich items as well.  Definitely worth the food dining experience, in my opinion.</review>

< review>
This Togo's off Top can never get my serves if it was the last place to eat on earth. I walked in They looked at me like Stunned....! I waited in line the Employee ask was I lost, & what did I want. Didn't speak to me like they did with  everyone else, Rude, No Customer Service Skills, & to be honest i toke it as a Raciest thing.  Sad but true....when I go to tell her what I want she hand me a menu starts helping the guy behind me as if I wasn't  ready or needed more time to look for what I wanted. I looked at her & told her to have a great day, walked out pissed. They laughed...yes they laughed. Overall the place was nice, clean, & in a plaza with a lot others stores or food places. Really nice clean area I must say never this problem in the other places in area I go to on my lunch break, hurt my feelings people can be so rude. ....<//review>

<Review>Overall today I had a very unsatisfactory sandwich experience. It was pretty much my first time at Togo's not somewhere I go often. So I'm ordering my son I could sandwich and instead of giving me a kids menu price ordeal they charge me for a 3-inch sandwich a chips and a drink. I didn't notice until afterwards that they offered a kids meal. I ordered a bacon chicken ranch wrap and ask for the ranch on the side. The gentleman acknowledged that would be fine and went ahead and put the ranch on the wrap. I asked him for the side of ranch he said oh you want more? I said no I wanted it on the side is it not?
They were just very unorganized and sloppy. It takes a lot for me to actually give a place a poor review but I definitely wouldn't recommend this one I will however try another Togo's just to see if it's an across-the-board problem</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I gave only 2 stars because I had to add the veggies to my 3 sandwiches and salad and the person that took my order over the phone sounded like I woke him up. I was there around 5:30pm. The lunch crew is alot better.
I picked up sandwiches for dinner tonight. The sandwiches were supposed to have all veggies with the exception of no pickles and no mustard.  The salad was supposed to have an extra dressing. The sandwiches only had lettuce and pickles. The asian chicken salad had no crunchy wontons, no cilantro and no green onions.
For the price of the food everything should have been made as requested.  If it helps, repeat the order back so there's no screw ups. Write down the order so you don't forget.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

You know usually I never have anything bad to say about here but my last visit was awful.  I ordered  a triple dipper on parmasian & they forgot the pastrami, gave me an onion roll, no cheese, & half the veggies I asked for.  It was a trainy that helped me but no one was actually training her & no one else was making sandwiches so it took a awhile.  I'll try it again.< /text>

<review>We took our grandkids for ice cream last Saturday. We sat at a table and were there for about 20 minutes. During this time not once did an employee clean a table or sweep debris from the floor. The place was disgustingly dirty. A manager or owner needs to light a fire under someone. There were plenty of staff there. We bussed our own table before we sat down at the least disgusting table. Won't go back.</review>< pictures>

<review>The sandwich was sub par. The workers uniforms were very dirty. The tables were sticky. I also purchased an ice cream from the baskin robins side. The worker started to make the wrong order (cookie sandwich instead of sundae) then when she made my sundae the scoop was very small, smaller than a child's size. I mentioned the size and she shrugged her shoulders as if she didn't care. I won't be coming back to this location.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

It's okay good sandwiches a little on the expensive side as far as sandwiches go but not terrible. A large 9" is like $9 but they give a good amount of meat which is nice.< /Text>

<Review>I was invited to take a Monday morning African dance class. It was taught by a beautiful, talented and spiritual young lady named Nayre! Her class fed my soul as well as giving me a great workout! I can appreciate a good sweat.  The gym is nice and having a sauna to relax and stretch was a great bonus after an amazing workout.  I looked into the spa services for my next visit. They where very affordable not over priced. I left the gym feeling more appreciative of the word ABUNDANCE.  Total Woman gym +spa is worth the membership!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Sadly had to change my rating because they changed there childcare without any notice to parents. I brought my child in august and was unable to workout because the children's area was closed for the month. An email warning me of this change ahead of time would be appreciated. I took the month off and returned to find the kids club hours are by appointment only and evenings are no longer included. What about moms that want to workout in the evening/ night?</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Was visiting the area for a month. I did not realize that a gym/spa was attached, walked by it on several occasions. I like the fact that it offers child supervision for a fee while one receives services. I have not used that specific services but it is a plus for being offered. The physical gym itself appeared small in size, although I did not use the gym service. I used the Spa for Massage Treatment Therapy. Perhaps for a 1st time customer some initial form of a treat/small gift and/or short tour should be offered upon booking your 1st service/on arrival. The entry way/lobby  could be a smidge more inviting, ie, zen feeling/look or inviting music. Overall the therapist was good. Also it appeared as if I couldn't pay for 2 things together & had to be charges separately for tipping & making a purchase for another item...Perhaps system could be more user friendly & allow certain or all transactions on 1 bill/cash out< /Review>< Pics>

Great place.  Love it.  But I feel pressured to get the trainer.  I  just want to go and exercise on my own but every time I go but I get this pressure.  I paid for one training day but I m actually not interested.  I possibly will cancel my membership.<//text>

<text>I love this gym, I started using it just over a year ago when I moved temporarily into the area and have nothing but positive things to say about the facility.

Firstly, the staff and very professional and friendly and the manager Shauna is a treat to deal with.

Secondly, the gym is clean, tidy and smells great.  The equipment seems to be new with a small but good selection of weight training material and aerobic exercise equipment.  The classes are varied and the instructors professional and caring.  I also love that it is never too overcrowded.  You can pretty much get to work out on what you desire.  The sauna and spa are also clean,  nice locker system too.  My only suggestion would be to extend the hours of closing to 10:00 pm or later if possible.

Overall, it has been a great relationship.  Had to leave as I moved out of the area.  I'm hoping that my new gym is as good.

Thank you guys for being there when I needed a good gym!

Love Bev:-)<//text>< gmapID>

This place is amazing! Love coming after class to work out for a couple hours, everyone is breaking a sweat. The only thing that bugs me is the fact that i can never really use the pool, i love being able to join in on any class thats going on. but i like to swim laps, besides that its a really great gym with amazing classes and people.<//review>

I love this Gym because is close by, is clean most of the time ( although it need to be  keep it clean towards the afternoon, and toiletries.). However lately some work out machines are out of service for over a month and addition to that cable is disconnected in some machine and the  steam room is  out of services for about two Weeks or more. Unfortunately the gym  is not kept up at it's best.  Sadly service around this area is extremely poor.</Review>

THIS IS THE VERY BEST GYM EVER!!!  If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars I would. This is soooo awesome for a woman! It is kept impeccably clean, includes locks on the lockers, steam room, sauna, fun classes,  and wonderful spa services that can be included in your gym membership (THE BEST DEAL IN TOWN)! All of the workers are friendly and helpful,  beautiful 5 star bathrooms & showers (what other gym can you say that about??), I could just go on and on. The only reason why a woman in the area would not be at this spa is because she just doesn't know about it. I have been a member at 24hr, L.A. Fitness, Planet Fitness, YMCAs, etc. etc. and hands down this Total Woman's Spa Gym is the BEST gym ever for a woman. I am a lifer here!< /text>

<text>I have never waited for a machine, which is more than I can say about other gyms. I have yet to try out their classes, so I can't speak to that. But as someone who doesn't enjoy working out, I have to say this gym keeps me coming back.< /text>< Name>

I am so happy I found this place! I usually pay 4X more than I did for highlights (I have dirty blonde hair and get highlights to brighten it) and they did such a great, natural job. I was also shocked how quick and efficient they were, sometimes I am stuck in the chair for hours and hours and this only took 2 1/2 hours. Also Mino and the woman who did my highlights were so sweet. Highly recommend and will be back!</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Found Mino on google search because my hair needed help. Looked around and the haircuts were more than double of what it costs at Mino Salon. So glad I found Mino. Mino is a highly experienced hairstylist and knows how to make your hair look good. My hair looks so much better now. Lots of layers, easy maintenance, and looks great. So happy with the cut.
Highly highly recommended!< /review>< Pictures>

I’ve been coming to master-stylist Mino for years! He is the absolute best haircut in the city. I always leave happier than the last time. He is incredibly professional and I always leave feeling like $1million. I recommend him to everyone, truly never disappointed. Go to Mino!!<//text>

Loved my haircut and color from Mino and Avi!! Took the time to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. My hair is really thin and fine and gets dry really easily so they made sure I walked out looking and feeling great! Thank you so much!< /review>

First time getting a haircut since the pandemic started and Mino certainly delivered. He took great care to get rid of split ends and I left so happy with a clean and trendy cut! Very clean and professional place. Feeling human again!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This is my first time visiting this salon, and wow am I impressed! I don’t have a regular hair stylist as I am moving around constantly, and I decided to give this a shot since I saw positive reviews. Mino (the master hairstylist) cut my hair and he is incredibly friendly and professional; he did everything he could to make sure that I was happy and that it looked perfect. I went from medium-long length to shoulder length and it looks fantastic. I would definitely recommend others to get their hair cut here!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKPS0jTsSJAb7Yesuu-W5-ICSRwoRRS9M0_zAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

I really enjoy the quality of service and high level of professionalism offered by Mino salon. Mino and Avi have years of experience, so they are real experts when it comes to hair color, styling, hair cuts and hair care in general. In addition, they are amazing and easy going people. Both, my son and I, have been using Mino salon, and we are both always extremely happy with the results.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a timely, affordable, and high quality hair services.</Review>

I’m very picky about hairdressers, but it was a no-brainer to stick with him. He always makes sure to cut it exactly how I want by always asking questions and doing mid-cut checks to ensure I’ll be happy with the final result.

I found Mino while looking through nearby salon reviews; I saw a photo of my friend in one of his reviews after I saw her new haircut in person.
She looked chic and cute so I made my own appointment.  Mino scheduled to see me within the hour and, even though I showed up with oily hair, gave me a great dry cut.  Quick and easy and we had a great conversation.  The girl who was here before me seemed really happy with her cut, too.  I sat, I stood, I whipped my head around, we philosophized--it was a great cut.  LOL.  Usually getting a bob-length cut on my fine hair yields mediocre, librarian-esque results, but Mino knew exactly how to keep the look flirty and youthful. Will definitely be returning.< /Text>

<Review>First time coming to Mino and he did a wonderful job giving me a fresh French Bob and helpful tips on how to work with my hair type. His hair cutting process was very meticulous and I really appreciate the time he took to get to know my hair type and recommend great products to help it improve. Also the free parking was very convenient and accommodating for a last minute appointment! Will definitely be coming back!< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2b92dee29f009:0x1bb0558911ace3b3< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Mino was referred to me by a friend after I moved here from London and was after a good, and reliable barber. Mino was extremely welcoming, and honestly gave me one of the best haircuts I have ever had. The fade on my sides were incredible. Mino constantly asked me throughout my haircut if I was happy, and if there was any changes that I would like. This to me was very important as I am very specific in the way I like my hair cut.

Overall, 10/10. Would highly recommend Mino to anyway who wants a great haircut at an even better price!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX9-I-BsceLmNPLFFFRX57SM8bFWRfhO4xuUAW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

I went and got my hair done at a different hair salon and received a very uneven cut, especially uneven when it came to my layers and my bangs. Last minute on a Friday night, Mino graciously took me in and fixed everything - not to mention in such a quick and professional manner! I didn’t even know how uneven the back of my hair was until he showed me in the mirror. He trimmed my bangs until they were perfectly even and exactly to my liking. My hair actually has a STYLE to it now. I can’t express how grateful I am to have found him!< /Text>< gmap_id>

First time getting a haircut here today and I'll definitely be going back. Mino gave me the exact cut that I wanted, was very meticulous in getting it just right, and he's super friendly. The place was very clean and they followed all Covid protocols. Plus free parking in the back. Highly recommend! :)</Review>

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a timely, affordable, and high quality hair services.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>Came here to fix my quarantined self haircut lol!
Just recently moved here and looked around for hair salons, this place is definitely professional and reasonably priced! Usually for this are is so overpriced, I've seen some for $300+!!
Mino knew exactly what I wanted and made it even better tbh, he made everything very comfortable and easy to talk to. I've been to so many salons that mess up my bangs and make them too short but Mino knows what he's doing and makes it proportioned to your face.
This place is definitely soooo worth it and very clean!!
My new spot now!!! For reallllll!!!< /text>< date>

Mino was referred to me by a friend after I moved here from London and was after a good, and reliable barber. Mino was extremely welcoming, and honestly gave me one of the best haircuts I have ever had. The fade on my sides were incredible. Mino constantly asked me throughout my haircut if I was happy, and if there was any changes that I would like. This to me was very important as I am very specific in the way I like my hair cut.

Overall, 10/10. Would highly recommend Mino to anyway who wants a great haircut at an even better price!< /Text>

<text>Great hair cut and highlighting - a ton of care and attention to detail. Mino and his wife do a fantastic job together creating a beautiful look as well as making the customer experience enjoyable. They were both very knowledgeable and excited to share what they know.

<Review>Mino’s Salon is the best hair salon in Los Angeles I’ve ever came across. Mino’s haircuts are beyond beautiful and they always exceed my expectations.

Mino Salon is fantastic! I called after reading all of the good reviews since I had been having a terrible experience at another popular salon. My other hairdresser had given me not one but two terrible perms that never took at all and only damaged my hair. I called Mino to try something different and he offered me a consultation and was able to fit me in right away. He was on time and the team sat with me, took the time to assess what I was trying to do and gave me amazing advice, explaining each step as we went. If you want something done right the first time go to Mino Salon! My perm came out perfectly and the staff were extremely kind, attentive and answered all of my questions. The location is clean and Mino spaces out clients and was diligent with covid-safety. This is everything that I have been looking for in a local salon and I will definitely be returning the next time I need a haircut or perm!<//Review>

<Text>I hadn’t had a haircut in some time and Mino was nothing but accommodating. I came in a little last minute and he took the time to do a thorough professional job, making sure every line and fade was just right. There was no cutting corners. Very clean and pleasant experience. Mino is a fun worldly barber and makes the cut an experience. Haircut looks good and was much needed.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b92dee29f009:0x1bb0558911ace3b3</Gmap_id></record>

I found Mino through Yelp and was impressed by the number of great reviews that mentioned his great attitude and the fact that he would check in periodically to make sure he was capturing what you wanted. I had the same experience :)

Mino was very kind and had great attention to detail. I appreciated him checking in each time he took length off. We both wore masks, he took our temperatures, and he sanitized the station before I sat down.

There is parking behind the building. I rode my bike and parked it outside the back door, locked to a pipe.

I’m very happy with my cut and am glad to know he does color as well :)<//Text>

Your barber was professional when it comes to hairstyling. Without your barber, I couldn't enjoy my new hairstyle now. You expect me to visit your barbershop next time. You must be at the top! Very strongly recommended to everyone!</review>

<review>Mino and Miriam are incredibly passionate and professional! They've created an environment that is very welcoming and relaxing - you get the best quality hair care without the stuck up feel that some high end salons have here in LA. The bottom line is that they care deeply about what they do and you completely feel that when you're here. Highly recommend!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN18NLvXjc3Eoywmq3PltqnNicmLjILrsrR0Jnn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><review>After the salon I had a reservation with closed early I went to Yelp for help and was able to find Mino! It was already 7pm so most places were closed or not getting back to me because it was so last minute (and walk ins don’t really exist right now), but Mino was able to squeeze me in between clients last minute! And the location is perfectly located and easy to get to because it’s so close to the grove. Very covid friendly and I felt safe with the regulations they had set in place, and it was just us until the next client came in.

As for the haircut I’m super happy! I have curly hair and was nervous after my last haircut didn’t know how to handle it and did bad layers. Mino understood and actually convinced me to get layers again and I love it! You can tell he has so much experience with how he handled my hair and I will be coming back!

Thanks Mino!</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2b92dee29f009:0x1bb0558911ace3b3<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>I am so happy with my new haircut! Mino and Avi were very friendly and patient with all my questions, and made great recommendations on the style and hair color that would look the best on me. Mino is a great communicator. He took his time explaining on how much he was going to cut, and ensured that I was ok with the length and style as he progressed. He is extremely meticulous; he made sure the haircut looked good from all different angles. I highly recommend this place - it's an amalgamation of high quality and great value.</Review><UserId.>105473285855325807693<//UserId.><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x80c2b92dee29f009:0x1bb0558911ace3b3< /GmapID>< Name>

You can not go wrong with this guy, he always gets it right. You can tell he knows what he’s doing. Very knowledgeable and professional. He loves his golden clipper and he’s available seven days a week. He listens to what you want, most salons in the area charge twice as much for the type of cut that Mino gives. He’s been doing it for more than 35 years and he always had a good story to tell. It is reassuring to know he allows follows COVID 19 guidelines.<//Review></record>

There is accessible parking right out back so you don’t have to pay for street parking.  They took my temperature before I went in, so I felt more comfortable in terms of COVID.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>So easy and great. I was in desperate need of a haircut and wasn't willing to risk it if there was any chance of being exposed before the holidays. I called mino and he assured me that i would be the only one in the store and sure enough, easy parking and a temperature test at the door made it so easy. So close to the grove, good food nearby, fair pricing, all and all incredible. Everything was cleaned before and after- great and safe call for those who want to get a pre new year shape up with a stylist who is experienced and can work around a mask!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Mino and Avi were very accommodating, friendly and helpful. I came in with a vague idea of what I wanted and both of them were able to read my mind and understand what I was going for. The highlights I wanted came out super nice, very natural looking and exactly the level of subtlety I was looking for. The hair cut itself was masterfully done - both Mino and Avi have a lot of experience and provide a wonderful service for a great price (I did a lot of research prior and was worried I’d need to pay 100+ for a great haircut). I will definitely be returning. ALSO the salon only takes a few clients at a time so I felt safe re covid. Hair cut 5/5 highlights 5/5</Text>

I came here for a hair cut and was highly satisfied by the quality for service and end result. I decided to come back a month later for a color job. The Salon uses high quality products and Mino and his co worker were a pleasure to work with.< /Text>

< review>
This was one of the best haircare services I've received in the 5+ years of living in Southern California.

Mino Salon (Master Stylist) is a gem of a find. I called the salon and Mino himself picked up right away. He was friendly, professional and incredibly accommodating from directing me to their private parking lot, consulting me on my haircut and color while personable and demonstrating a technical mastery in the way he communicates. The consultation he gives is honest and he is transparent about the cost breakdown

I was really worried about finding a good salon amidst the pandemic but was pleasantly surprised and comforted by the safety standards set in place. At most there was only two people in the salon at one time, everyone wore masks the entirety of the service, everyone's temperature was taken who walked through the door and the seats were sanitized after every use.

Mino did my haircut and Avi did my color. He was very attentive, made suggestions and gave me exactly the haircut I wanted. Avi was incredibly detailed and accommodating with the color, taking the time to make sure it was its best.

If you need a quality, safe, personable and professional service for your hair- look no further! I'm very happy with the results.<//review>

It really pains me to write this review, but I feel the need to warn other customers about this salon after my absolutely traumatic and horrible experience there. I trusted the glowing reviews for Mino online and gave him a try after not having a haircut for almost a year due to quarantine. I went into the salon with long, thick wavy hair down to my waist. I routinely receive many compliments on my long hair, so I made very clear to Mino that I wanted to keep it on the longer side, but cut as much as would allow me to still wear it in a high ponytail. I lifted my hair into a high ponytail to show him the length I wanted. It would come to about mid-back or chest area. Then suddenly, without warning, Mino HACKED OFF ALL MY HAIR in one motion. He just sawed it off at shoulder length, and then quickly ran into the back of the salon holding my hair in his hands. I was in such shock and immediately demanded to know why he had done this.

He had many excuses, but ultimately admitted that he made a mistake. But since he kept my hair, my suspicion is that he will sell my very long thick hair for money, since virgin hair (never chemically treated or dyed) of that length and thickness can be sold for hundreds of dollars to make wigs. My hair ended up being chin-length when blow-dried, but even shorter when airdried. I feel violated and robbed of my beautiful long hair that took me years to grow.

I will also add that this salon is NOT following pandemic protocols. When I made the appointment, Mino said I would be the only client in the salon, but when I arrived, there were a total of 8 people packed into the small space, and one of the customers was not wearing a mask. The salon looked very dirty and Mino didn't disinfect any surfaces before seating me in the chair that was just occupied by someone else. I should have left right then and there, but I felt guilty and wanted to be polite.

In the end, Mino offered to not charge me for my haircut, but I refused his offer and still paid for it, because I don't want him to think that he "made it right" somehow. It can't be made right until the hair grows back, which will take a long time. I'm sure Mino will deny my suspicion that he sold my hair, but I have no trust in anything he says after what happened to me in his salon.<//review>

<review>Mino gave me the best haircut I have had in years. I had been previously growing out my hair, and was hesitant to get it cut. However, from the moment I sat in the chair I knew I could relax. Mino sanitized all equipment used, and even delayed his own process to ensure the sanitizing was completed. Not only is the cut excellent, but above all I felt safe during and after. I am still getting compliments on this cut weeks after. Mino, thank you! I'll see you again next time!< /review>< username>

I am still fairly new to LA and have not yet found "my salon" yet. I was sick of my hair being so long and wanted a change. Went through a bunch of places on Yelp and Google. Most places around weho and Beverly Hills charge an arm and a leg for a haircut. Came across Mino salon and saw great reviews. The haircuts and colors looked awesome so I just called to see if they were even operating during covid. Mino was very nice on the phone and told me a haircut would be 78. That is almost unheard of in my neck of the woods. He took me the very same day I needed a major hair change.

Parking is very easy there is a parking lot in the back. The area is also very fun. When I first got there, Mino was wearing a mask, as am I, and the entire time I was there. He took both of our Temperatures before we proceeded. Mino took his time. Even though I said I wanted it about 6 inches shorter, he took inches off little by little to make sure I didn't regret going too short! He listened very carefully and gave me the haircut that I wanted. He also flipped my hair to clean the underlayers which my old salon back home never did for me. I felt like I got one on one attention and was very pleased with the service.

Overall, I am very happy with my haircut. And I believe I have found "my salon". Coming back next time for hair color and conditioning mask.

There aren't a lot of places where the stylists listen to what you want. I have cried in the past with bad hair cutting. I know my hair will always be in good hands with Mino salon :)< /text>

Mino was incredibly accommodating with fitting in my appointment in at a time that worked for me. Not only was it the best coloring job I've ever had (thanks Avi!!), the products they use are so high end that my hair came out feeling restored & hydrated (which has never happened before since I'm originally brunette, so blonde treatments tend to be harsh). They use really high end top notch products. Also, they got the job done in 2 hours -- when it's taken up to 4 hours at other salons (I have a lot of hair). They got it the EXACT shade that I wanted it and didn't even have to use toner. That's how you know they're good! The cut was great too - Mino really shaped my hair to frame my face perfectly. I'm so relieved to find such a reliable, amazing hair dresser in mid-city LA.< /text>< Pictures>

I have been struggling to find a hairstylist for a while and decided to give Mino a chance back in August 2020. After the best haircut I've received, I returned to Mino's salon today. Yet again, Mino gave me a wonderful haircut and I can confidently say that I will be going to Mino from here on out. Mino is extremely talented and has been cutting hair for over 35 years. His experience is truly impeccable and his technique is unlike anything I have ever seen! I thoroughly enjoyed watching Mino cut my hair because he turns it into an art. He listens to what you want and continuously taps in to see if you are aligned. Lastly, he is very graceful and meticulous in the way he cuts and would rather cut a tad less than more in the beginning. Should you want more to be cut, Mino will gladly trim without risking any unpleasant or shocking outcomes.

In terms of Covid procedures, there was no one else in the salon so I felt very comfortable. Mino made sure to check both his and my temperature before the cut and he sanitized the chair before I sat down.

Finally, there is free parking in the back so be sure to take advantage of that when you go!! Highly recommend checking out Mino's Salon!<//Review>

I asked him if he was sure he could cut my hair, he said his expertise is not in curly hair, and he saw my pictures and said he could. He insisted. I show him pictures of myself of EXACTLY!!! What I want. I give EXPLICIT instructions. I look ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like the picture. Quite literally. Did NOT!! Follow my instructions!
More than halfway through, he tells me he doesn’t do parts, which is in the pictures I showed him. I can’t even look myself in the mirror, this haircut is horrendous to my self-confidence. Sad to say, I’ll never be going back.  I don’t really leave reviews like this, but I haven’t had a haircut this bad in a long time and ruined almost a year of work I’ve done to my hair.

<review>This is a family run business, the owners are a very sweet staff who work hard. The pricing is reasonable, it’s clean, professional. Very covid19 cautious every time i go. They take my temp and sanitize in front of me . They do great hair cuts and highlights. Avi does an amazing blowdry. They are always available last minute, they are appointment only but when i call They fit me in and make it happen. Always a great job. 10/10 recommend.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Mino's salon is a super professional place in LA. He always listens to to what u exactly want and gets all the details.

I found Mino during COVID time and his place is always clean and sanitized. I have never seen the place super busy so no more than 2-3 people in the salon. He always checks temperature before u get in and masks are a must.

He's very detail oriented and pays a lot of attention to what u want. Im super happy with my haircut and have been referring many people who are very happy as well.

The best part about this salon is ease of parking. U can use their parking behind the store right next to the has station. Also Mino is super friendly and always brings up fun facts and interesting conversations. So u are never bored while u are sitting there getting your hair cut.

I do suggest getting an appointment. Its very easy to just call him direct and he'll work with u on your availability. Usually same day appointments are available.

To sum it up, Mino is highly suggested. He has years of experience and his quality of work shows that he knows what he's doing. Definitely one of the best hair salons in LA with a very reasonable price.

Mino is a true master stylist! I’ve been coming to him for 10 years now. He’s does the everything: highlights, keratin treatment and consistently great cuts. Great atmosphere, conversation and location. He’s really knows what he’s doing and will give exactly what you’re looking for. Also, great prices for the area.< /review>

Mino Salon was recommended to me by two of my friends who have gone and I was just amazed and impressed by the professionalism of the salon. Walking into the salon you seriously feel like walking to a fashion runway full of beautiful people. I made an appointment online and on the day I was greeted by friendly staff who saw to my stylist and assistant promptly.<//review>

Faryl is a goddess sent from above! She has been doing my hair for the past year at least! I even flew to Los Angeles from Long Beach after I moved so she could continue to work her magic on my hair! She is the best, I cannot recommend her enough. Also this salon is gorgeous and everyone is super friendly and awesome! Check this place out! Reasonable prices as well!!!< /text>

< Review>
Mino listens to what you want and checks in during the haircut! It's centrally located near the grove, and so much more affordable than the salons in the area (It even has free parking in the back). I was considering doing box dye at home since I was on a budget, but we settled on an amazing price for a cut and color. He fit my appointment in the day of, and even stayed late to do my hair, and asked me when was convenient for me!

He took the time to tell me what he was doing, and ask my input along the way. When I wanted more layers and texture he went back in and checked in again. He uses really quality dyes, and knows a lot about hair--I got lots of fun hair facts along the way. His wife did my color, and was very sweet and had gentle hands. She came to the studio just for my appointment, I was the last one there!

Also yes, the leaning over haircut is a little unconventional, but he got all my split ends in the back so...worth it!

Thanks so much for being flexible and thoughtful!< /Review>

<Text>I found Mino Salon on Yelp after relocating to the LA area. After 2 haircuts here I can say that I won’t be going anywhere else. Master Stylist Mino is super friendly, detailed oriented, and actually listened to what I wanted. Master stylist Mino does cuts by APPOINTMENT ONLY and was able to get me in within 24 hours. I recommend coming here for any of your hairstyling needs!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

If you’re looking for a really good cut & color this is the place to go! I’ve been going to Master stylist Mino for several years.  I’ve tried many other salons in the city and when I met Mino he’s a true artist and has the best technique. He’s cut hair for 38 years and you can see it in your hair when he’s done. I truly recommend to check him out. He’s in a great location , next to the Grove & Farmers Market, with free parking in the back and by appointment only. The prices are very affordable compared to other salons. He’s work is efficient and fast so you won’t be stuck in the salon all day. Even with his busy schedule he’ll always make room for you.          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!<//text>

Mino gave me the best hair cut of my life! He made sure to pay attention to detail and gave me a fresh new look. He even took the time to cut underneath my  hair to make sure no split ends were left and to give it a great, natural shape. I will definitely be coming back!</Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I have come to Mino’s salon the past 3 haircuts. I live close by so it’s extremely convenient for me, plus there is parking in back. I love how he truly cares about the health of your hair and listens to your concerns and wants regarding your hair. I keep coming back because it’s exactly what I need— a quick haircut that’s affordable with a stylist I can trust! Very accommodating and fit me right in his schedule. He also does color and highlights, but I usually stick to a quick trim. Definitely recommend!</Review></record>

THEY WORK BY APPOINTMENT ONLY-CALL FIRST !!

I got a haircut yesterday evening at Mino Salon by master stylist Mino, and I must say this is one of the best haircuts I have ever had in Los Angeles. This was an important haircut for me because I have a few events coming up in in the next couple of weeks. You can tell the guy is a pro: he is friendly and very creative, and the reviews are spot on. The staff is very accommodating,  and the price is totally reasonable.  I used to pay twice as much at my old salon. I highly recommend this place, and I will definitely be coming back. Thanks, Mino!</review>

<text>I’ve come to Mino Salon’s a few times and always leave with a really great haircut. Master stylist Mino takes his time and makes sure you get exactly what you want. He listens and offers good hair suggestions. (Plus there is free parking in the behind the salon.) Will definitely be coming back in the future!</text><Date>1570062267157</Date><rating>5</rating>< userid>

I found this salon through Google, and it happened to be near where I live. Both my girlfriend and I needed a haircut/color – I love how Mino cut our hair. The color was fantastic, and the staff were friendly. It was hard to make a reservation because it was so busy, but we called ahead and were able to make an appointment. My girlfriend loves the color (it was very high quality). The prices are reasonable especially compared to other salons in the area. We were also able to save some more money by utilizing the free parking. It’s hidden away behind the salon but it’s there. My girlfriend and I will definitely be back.</text><user_id>108297343492210488195<//user_id><rating>5<//rating><gmap_id>0x80c2b92dee29f009:0x1bb0558911ace3b3< /gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<text>I have hair that is very difficult to manage, and have gone to one stylist for 6 years now. He went out of town and I found Mino online after seeing countless amount of 5 star reviews. I'm really happy that I found him he gave me the best haircut that I got in my life! My search is over and he has my business forever...  Mino listens to what I want, talks to me about how it will work with my hair, and then he does it. Everyone has heard the phrase "you get what you pay for", I now know that wisdom applies to haircuts and I have to say Mino is worth every penny! If you want the best cut go see Mino, he is one of the best in the biz!<//text><user_name>Bardia Sabour<//user_name><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

I found my forever salon! Rebecca is amazing! I called the salon two separate times, talked to two different people, and asked who their best colorist was.. without hesitation they both said Rebecca! So right away I knew I had to be booked with her, and was instantly excited to see this all-star colorist. I left her chair feeling beautiful and refreshed, and she also did it in a way that was healthy for my hair. So she absolutely lived up to the standard as the -hands down BEST colorist at Scarlet Salon-!! Like wow. And on top of that she is ridiculously friendly and easy to talk to. Go see her now! I am sooo glad that I did!!<//review>

Mino was awesome! He was super accomodating with scheduling my appointment and saw me right away when I came in. He was very collaborative during the cut and asked for my thoughts through every step. He finished my cut in under 40 minutes which was really great and took extra care to make sure my hair was proportional all over. Muño was super attentive and his salon is lovely with plenty of parking out back. Great all around!</Review>

To be honest, I don't usually leave a salon feeling like I love my haircut and could wear it out - Ernesto's haircut at Mino Salon changed that.  I just assumed that it would always be after a day or two and a shower that my hair would look more "me", but I left feeling like I had one of the best cuts ever.  Ernesto gave me such a great haircut and was really fun to sit and talk to for the experience.  The attention to detail and really great customer service made this a pleasurable experience and I am sure to come back. Thanks Ernesto!</Review>

I love this place! I stopped here for a hair cut as soon as I moved to LA. Mino asked me how much I wanted cut and gave me just that. Most places cut so much more than you want them to. He also cleaned my whole cut instead of doing just a trim. The prices are affordable. I was able to make an appointment the next day for highlights. These too exceeded my expectations.</Review>

<Text>Love my color!
After doing my research on Google and yelp looking for a place that has affordable prices and good reviews, I decided to give this place a try.
Great service and I really love how my color turned out. I got exactly the cut and color that I wanted and needed. The cut was done by master stylist mino, a true pro. And you can tell these are people who are passionate about what they do which is rare these days.
I will happily return for touchups and future hairstyles, highly recommended!</Text>< pictures>

Mino was horrible, chauvinistic, rude,  dismissive, opinionated and down right did what he want and gave my friend a bad cut. He refused to listen, we had to scream stop cutting over and over while he kept saying he knew best. Bizarre, never seen someone refuse to stop cutting to the point of begging. He did it on purpose because he felt it was his salon, dp not waste your time or money please.<//Text>

This is the best haircut I have ever gotten. He was incredibly through and took the time to make sure the whole thing was perfect. The salon is adorable, they place nice music, AND they are incredibly affordable! Street parking can be a touch tricky so be sure to leave youself some time to find a spot.<//review>

I have lived at Greenfield Village since 2010.  There have been some bumps in the road, but nothing that couldn’t be fixed with communication. Change is constant in life, and I have enjoyed my stay at Greenfield Village. The cost to rent here could be more reasonable. It’s expensive.<//Review>

We’ve been here for almost a year and love it! Very clean, quite, nice gym & pool. And every time we have a maintenance problem we put a report in & next day they’re here to fix it free of charge! Only reason I put 4 stars & not 5 is because we’ve had our fire alarms checked twice but they still go off every time we showed with hot water. I guess the steam is setting them off. But overall nice place for cheap rent. We plan to stay long.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

{'time': 1589997250929, 'text': 'Angie, we appreciate your feedback. Because the majority of the community consists of mid-rise buildings, we do have several fire alarm systems which include individual alarms for apartment homes as well as sprinkler systems for the common areas and elevators and do activate if smoke or heat is detected. The sounding alarm is in place for your protection and we apologize, for any inconvenience the noise has caused you. With regards to your service request, it would only be cancelled if it was considered a non-emergency under the Stay at Home Order or was a duplicate submission, which appears to be the case in your situation. We have the utmost faith in our associates, and we can assure you that they do not take mail from other residents, that is considered a crime under federal law. With respect to the packages being left in the parcel room, Amazon hires independent contractors, who don’t always take the time to deliver properly by placing the packages in the lockers. We have been working with Amazon and Parcel Pending to get their help with addressing these issues but encourage you to contact them as well if you’ve not received any packages that you were expecting. If you’re still having any maintenance issues with your dishwasher or ceiling vent, please email greenfield@rvmsd.com or call us directly at 619-661-8108. We’d be happy to discuss it in more detail and place a new service request, if necessary. We look forward to the opportunity to speak to you and address your concerns.'}< /resp>

I wish I were able to move, but I dont have the means to. Random fire alarms go off with no warning, either for the building or for my apartment. Nothing is burning or smoking, but mine are going crazy and making my ears bleed and had to call maintenence. I've requested them to fix my leaking dishwasher and ceiling vent multiple times. Each time they came out for my dishwasher, its still not fixed and they mark it as done. My vent took leaked again about 2 months later after every fix. People and as I hear maintenance steal mail, even throw them down the garbage chutes to collect in the basement. I set up a access code for visitors that is supposed to call me when they try to access through the gate. Guess what, I doesn't ever work. Amazon mail is often stolen, half the time is left right outside the parcels in the parcel room for anyone to take. Yes I know thats a mail issue. But greenfield should enforce it and figure it out. Ive had sooo many issues here. Plus it's not in the best location for working as most stuff is northern San Diego for my field.<//Review>

Do not come near this place. I came for a visit with family and my car was stolen under the gated personal parking spot. Management was rude about it and said "What do you want me to do about it." Ontop of all of this the cops told me this happens often here and cops thinks it's a tenant. Please STAY AWAY from this place. Look at the other posts and believe what it says. If I can lower the rating I would.<//Text>

Within three days of moving in we had an issue with noisy neighbors, The unit had several issues when we moved in, maintenance did take care of them promptly, but its very disappointing that they were overlooked before the initial walk through, our car was broken into within a week of moving in, leasing office told my husband that they cannot do anything about it, I dont understand what the gates are for if they are open all day until 6pm...I have written three emails about our noisy upstairs unit and management has only replied once saying they are taking care of it, but if anything its gotten worse! Im just done writing emails if nothing will be done. If you are still looking to move in, make sure you know where your unit will be located, the trash room is next to ours which makes our entry way smell terrible and we hear day and night the door closing and trash falling into the dumpster...we also have a stair way next to us and we can hear that door slam shut all the way into our bedroom. parking is terrible and forget about visitor parking... so disappointed with this complex, we really thought we would love living here but its only been a month and so much has happened!</text>< pictures>

I am writing this review at 5 am and I say, how I did not read the reviews before? ... it is the worst place I have lived.  the pipes smell terrible and  the maintenance guys do nothing.  the place is dirty and the neighbors very loud.  at this time they are with the music in a high volume from 3 am.  if someone reads this please don't come here .... it's a lot of money for such a terrible service .... value your money ... don't live here<//text>

Lived here a year.
Honestly it was a terrible experience.
Fire alarms go off day & night for no reason. Good luck sleeping!
The office is poorly run & they are terrible about getting things done.
My upstairs neighbors would bang, drop, stomp, jump, BLAST music & TV, etc all day and night.
I called the patrol ALL THE TIME. I called the office ALL THE TIME. I FREAKIN EMAILED THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME bc they requested it be on paper.
They said they’d take care of it. Did they? NOPE.
Not to mention there’s often break ins. There’s multiple cops dealing w situations at this complex EVERY SINGLE DAY. No I’m not exaggerating. Me and my husband eventually started pointing it out every time we saw it.  Not safe. At all.
Not to mention there’s always annoying screaming children all the time. Constantly slamming into my door & don’t care because their parents don’t care enough to watch them. So love that clearly.
Rude staff.
They don’t care about their tenants.
Don’t move here. I promise you’ll regret it.< /Review>

<Review>Would rate lower if possible. I have many complaints but one of the issues that pushed me off the most was the amount of times the fire alarms went off... one night my wife and child were kept up until 3 am on a work day because they couldnt seem to fix what ever the issue was. My sons 7 MONTHS OLD! He needs his sleep. Dont move here for your own good.</Review>< Pics>

We were really amazed with this place at first. It was a nice community. The people at the office (I wont say names) was quite rude.

I would rate zero stars if I could! If you have pets, don't move here! At the end of your lease they will find a way to keep your deposit and charge for the smallest things! This place maybe a good community outside bit don't be fooled. The staff are ridiculous. They don't have a real person to talk to in their customer service.  Only emails? Really? When it comes to getting your deposit back, they will hold it for as long as they can. Even if you lease for one year, they will still charge you for the ware and tear.  They want $217 on top of the $1050 deposit I gave them. My husband had decided to not fight it anymore. You know the saying "if they took it, they might need it more than you do". Save yourself from all the trouble and find other apartment.

I move to an apartment in Chula Vista and I love it. The management is friendly and it doesn't nickel and dime you for everything!

I'm so disappointed with this apartment.
They are pet friendly, but will take all your deposit at the end of your lease. We are military and if you need help finding an apartment here in San Diego, let me know. and I will kindly lead you to a nice and friendly apartment. AVOID THIS APARTMENT!</Text>

WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE! If I could put no star I would. Save your money and don't move here. Management is horrible and I can not wait until my lease is up. They don't care if you have a complaint about anything. They brush it off and give you attitude about it. An example would be I have complained about people smoking weed and cigarettes inside the stairs yet they just said "oh ok". They are way too expensive and it's a COMMUNITY water bill so it doesn't matter how much you use, it matters how much everybody in your building uses. We went on vacation for a month and when we came back we had a water bill of $100! We didn't use any water that whole month! I also asked them about breed restrictions with dogs because my husband and I want to get a puppy for our son. When we first signed our lease they said we could and now they changed their minds and told us that we are not allowed to have animals in our apartment at all unless they are service animals. I told them that half of our building has dogs and about 2 of them are service animals the rest aren't and all I got was, oh well sorry. Really? That is the answer that you are going to give somebody. Very unprofessional staff. The only nice people that work there are the people that you seeing keeping the place clean. Everybody in the leasing office except the property manager is a joke. CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE OUT!!!<//text>

The down side to living here is parking! Why should the tenants have to pay for a parking pass?

It's hard for my roommates and I to have company b/c there aren't parking spaces available for the guest.

We are planning on moving in September to Greenfield Village. Our first contact was with Dawn and she was very nice and knowledgeable. We were having some difficulties do to a background check that included a record that was not ours, so the staff was great in helping us to correct it. Susie was a great BIG help. She made sure to stay in contact and did what she could. Caitlin was also very friendly and helpful. Everyone there has already made us feel welcomed. We are very excited to be moving to a place where they care!</text>

Maintenance is quick when it comes to issues with the apartment. Building 6 elevators don't always work. It has good gym time until 11pm for the weekdays. Parking is never an issue.<//Text>

do not, and i repeat, DO NOT LIVE HERE. noisy unattended children run around every courtyard between the hours of 3pm and 7pm daily. no exceptions. pools are backed in the summers with again, unattended children. unattended children in the computer room. unattended children everywhere. The front gate was broken open for a hot minute. They are very restrictive concerning permissible patio furniture....toys, bikes, brooms, decoration, regular patio stuff....all not allowed. please save your money, and move, anywhere, but here. i'm so bitter!<//review>

Hello My name is Vanessa and I have had an excellent experience with the management at Greenfield Village they were really nice and accommodating. My fiance was the one that came here first and feel in love the complex Dawn was the first person of contact and he had such a wonderful experiences with the tour Dawn gave that he called me and said after work we need to come here and see this apartment. After we have been searching for almost 2 months I feel in Love at first sight! All of the amenities were such a big plus in making this decision. Everyone in the office goes out of there way to make you feel welcome. After a couple of days we found out we were approved by Nico he was excellent to work with and sign those last documents to make it official. It was later in the afternoon and we wanted to take pictures of the apartment and he took us to do that he answered all of our questions with a smile on his face I am very please with Dawn and Nico if anyone is looking into this apartment complex ask for them two they were great! Thank you very much for your patience and helping us build a home in our new chapter of our life.</review>

<UserId.>112809318226780546504</UserId.><Text>Doesn't even deserve one star but I can't rate lower. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT sign a lease to this apartment complex. Yes the amenities are nice and all and they make it seem SO perfect when you come in to visit and have a tour but they fail to mention so many things! Like how parking SUCKS and they do nothing about the fact that people WITHOUT stickers on their cars are parking in spots that are supposed to be strictly for cars registered with a sticker that we have to PAY FOR which causes us to have to park outside of the complex that we pay to park INSIDE of or park in the loading zone where we will get towed. Or that the basketball court has been closed for MONTHS because the net on ONE goal is broken and it still hasn't been fixed. There are a bunch of hidden fees that they don't tell you about until the day you move in and then you have no other choice because well, it's time to move in and you've already signed your lease. If you're REALLY looking for a non-smoking community to live in, don't live here because they don't care if people smoke or not. lol I have seen NUMEROUS people smoking away and no one says anything to them. I'm not the type to report people especially if it doesn't directly affect me but if you don't like smokers, simply just don't live here. The maintenance technicians ARE NOT capable of performing maintenance correctly and the office just doesn't care. I recently had a fire in my kitchen that COMPLETELY melted and burnt my microwave and all the cabinets around it because I requested maintenance on my stove and the techs put the part on wrong causing the burner to burst in to flames not even 2 minutes after I turned it on. Well, they "fixed" the stove again and replaced the microwave and my stove just did the EXACT same thing as before not even 2 days after they claimed it had been fixed. My life and every other persons life in my building is in danger. I can't even safely cook in my own kitchen that I pay SO MUCH money to cook in. They also NEVER answer the phone when you call. It's like they're nonexistent. WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING A LEASING OFFICE IF NO ONE EVER ANSWERS?! I literally have NEVER posted a review on ANYTHING in my entire life because I feel it's pointless but in this case I had to and I hope it prevents someone from signing to live here.<//Text><rate>1</rate><Resp>None<//Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Of course everyone likes the amenities here, that's about the only nice part about the community.  Gates are never monitored, kids and teens jumping the fences and utilizing the gym/pool/play areas/building stairwells to smoke weed.  Now I don't mind if residents have guests or friends over, but when you're getting out of hand and stink of weed coming in to the gym/pool areas, it makes me question just how much the management monitor those areas.  None?  What's going on with crime here too?  Last night at 10pm, there were 4 armed police officers outside of my balcony window aiming RIFLES at a townhouse demanding a man come out.  Don't be fooled by the walk throughs.  Parking alone is a nightmare and project within itself.  Do your research on this community before moving in and I'm sure you'll see issues across the board.  Had I done mine, I probably wouldn't be residing here.  STAY AWAY!!!!!</review>

Just as reference, I don't live here.

We scheduled an appointment and went all the way to Otay to view the complex.

Been told by an employee ( who didn't give us his name, he was a big fat gentlemen) said that he has no apartments to show us although they scheduled us for 4PM.

We asked few questions to see if they have other 2 bedroom apartments that they could show us or if the apartments look alike.

Finally he agreed to take us to see one of the apartments.

Took us to 3 different place and didnt have the keys.

Didnt show us amenities or anything.

I must say that it was a very interesting day for us.

He seemed as if he didn't care or didn't want to work.</text>

Honestly the outside of the apartments are nice. The outside amenities are nice when they are working. I think the inside of the apartments could use some upgrades.  But the things I hate the most are the stairways aND the parking.  For some reason people think the stairways are public bathrooms. And there is is 11 visitors parking spaces for 900+ units to share and they will tow your cars. Other than that everything is peachie.< /Review>

<Review>** DO NOT LIVE HERE WORST MISTAKE EVER LEASING OFFICE EMPLOYEES ARE OF NO HELP THEY ALWAYS CHANGE MANAGEMENT NEW FACES ALL THE TIME NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE THEY MADE ME PURCHASE 2 PARKING PERMITS $50 WHEN YOU DO NOT NEED PERMITS TO PARK ANYWHERE UNLESS YOUR UNDERGROUND WHICH I WASN'T, AND THEY DID NOT REFUND ME. VISITORS CAN PARK ANYWHERE 24/7 AND THAT CAUSES YOU TO PARK OUTSIDE IN THE STREET ABOUT A MILE AWAY THIS COMPLEX IS OVER POPULATED  BUILDING WALLS ARE SUPER THIN YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING DOWNSTAIRS UPSTAIRS NEXT DOOR YELLING,SCREAMING,SEXUAL INTERCOURSE, DOORS SLAMMING, TV, MUSIC, FULL CONVERSATIONS NO PRIVACY AT ALL. THE BUILDING IS NEXT TO THE OLD 905 HIGHWAY SO ITS REALLY NOISY CARS FLYING DOWN THE HIGHWAYS ESPECIALLY SEMI TRUCKS THEY RATTLE THE BUILDINGS AND WINDOWS, NOT GOOD IF YOU HAVE BABIES. THE AMENITIES SUCK BBQ GRILLS NEVER WORK. THE POOL BY THE GYM IS ALWAYS CLOSED DOWN BY THE CITY FOR BEING SO DIRTY AND TOXIC. PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIVE HERE COME AND USE OUR AMENITIES WE PAY FOR SO ITS OVER POPULATED. THERE IS NO PARKING, GYM, OR POOL CONTROL. THE SECURITIES ARE A JOKE THEY DON'T ENFORCE ANYTHING. THE RENT GOES UP ABOUT $100 EVERY YEAR TILL YOU HIT MARKET VALUE.  LOOKS CAN BE REALLY DECEIVING, JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO SWAT FBI SHERIFFS WERE HERE AT 5AM BREAKING A DOOR DOWN PULLING PEOPLE OUTSIDE AT GUN POINT WITH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND THE SAME SITUATION HAPPENED ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO TO ARREST A SEX OFFENDER I CANT WAIT TILL MY LEASE IS OVER SO I CAN GET RID OF ALL THIS STRESS ITS NOT WORTH IT!!  SORRY NOT SORRY GREENFIELD VILLAGE THANKS FOR THE HORRIBLE 1 YEAR HERE AND THANKS FOR ADVISING ME TO MOVE OUT AFTER I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION LOL UNBELIEVABLE!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>I don’t think there would be any worst office management than the people working here. They only act like they care. I have been asking the manager 6 times to renew my lease she has never done it and i still get fully charged.

Most of the time the key fob won’t open the parking  gate you have to go park outside and wait few hours outside for someone to go out so you can get in the building.

People’s dogs keep barking at 6 am on a Sunday.

For future residents I would recommend you find an apt somewhere else.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80d948c67b39e777:0x65a3a5fb87f27a03<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Best spot in paramount and better than most coffee/donut shop chains. I come here almost everyday for their breakfast and iced coffee and I cant stop. Great food. Very nice ladies working there with great customer service skills. Highly recommend.< /Review>

This place is awesome! Even in the afternoon, their donuts taste great. Their Ham, Cheese, and Jalapeño Croissant was delicious, and their Honeydew Boba had just the right amount of sweetness. Whatever you order from them will be amazing, as everything I ordered was on point. You will not be disappointed!< /Text>

<text>This place is NOT a restaurant - it is a banquet hall and/or catering company - for small events like weddings, etc. so do not go there thinking you can arrive, read a menu and order food from it and stay to enjoy it. I suggested to a friend that we look for an authentic Armenian place in Glendale to try something new - drove all the way out to Glendale to try this place (coming from Monrovia) and when we walked into their patio area expecting that we could be seated and have lunch the woman - who was fetched from inside by one of two men who were Armenian-only speakers - started off by asking us if we spoke Armenian and then when I said "no" gave us a gesture meaning, "Well, what do you want?". I asked, "Could we get a table for two?" (the place had lots of empty tables and at 12:15 there was not one single person eating lunch there) she looked at me like I was asking for the most bizarre request, like she couldn't believe what she was hearing. Then she finally said in very limited words that they are open for special events only, and not a regular restaurant where you can sit down and order food, even though their sign clearly has the word "RESTAURANT" under their name on the big sign out in front. Oh well. We went down the street and spent $50 on lunch with someone else   where Armenian was not the required language and they allowed us to stay and eat.< /text><userid>111301792190595225650<//userid></record></dataset><record>

We had an employee Chrismas party here and the food and wait service provided was decent.  I cannot rate based on food or wait service, since I was unsure who it was provided by, but I had an overall great experience here.  It has everything you need for a venue; ample lighting, accessible restrooms, and space for deejays and a dance floor!</text>< pics>

<Text>I ate here for lunch with my husband today and asked the bartender if the restaurant’s dinner menu has more Armenian staple dishes such as “mante”. He then changed what I said and misled the owner to believe that I had said something else. The bartender took what I said out of context and unfortunately instead of the owner clarifying with us he got very defensive and scolded us for something we literally didn’t even say. We gracefully tried to clarify on three occasions and got interrupted each time. I am an Armenian from Dallas and was so excited to support another Armenian during my visit in Chicago but am sadly disappointed in this game of “telephone” turning into a big escalation. I don’t appreciate that the bartender misconstrued what I said and started drama and I am upset that the owner ran with it without first clarifying with the customer. This could have all been avoided and is a big case of miscommunication that should have been handled better. The food was good but unfortunately I couldn’t enjoy it after that.< /Text>< Pics>

The venue is newly renovated and looks OK. Food it not bad either. But the owners forgot to renovate the staff. I've been here twice in the last couple of months the service was the same both the times. It just  sucks. The waiter was very rude and unprofessional.<//Review>

We are so grateful and so lucky to have come across The Way Driving School years ago. Luis and and his team helped my daughter get her license years ago and, just last week, they also helped my son with this huge milestone. They affordably taught my kids the skills needed to drive safely and confidently and I cannot thank them enough. We are especially grateful to my son’s instructor, Jordan, for his consistent patience during all the extra lessons we scheduled. THANK YOU LUIS AND JORDAN!! 🙏🏽</review>

Throughout the experience of learning how to drive The Way Driving School has excelled at showing my child how the rules of the road and helping to make him comfortable with the challenges that he would face in the future. With this the people at The Way Driving School are extremely patient and considerate regarding every students personal approach to learning to drive and helping to counteract the fears that come with driving. I would 11/10 recommend The Way Driving School for educating future drivers on the road.</Text>

The Way Driving School has helped our family tremendously. Both my kids (one now 21 yrs old and one 16) learned so much from the instructors. The Way is a great technical resource and offers excellent customer service. High recommendation!< /text>

10 Star Rating-  most definitely the best choice of behind the wheel training.  what an amazing find!
I recently moved to California,  and was very fortunate to come across "THE WAY Driving School".  Luis is dedicated to ensuring that every student receives expert behind the wheel training.
Finding "THE WAY driving school was truly a blessing, after several horrific driving school experiences.
From owner Luis to instructors alike you will not find a driving school that has more integrity, more passion for teaching their students how to be safe drivers,  extremely patient and super professional too!
All instructors across the board are excellent, however I must commend Adele my instructor, for his patience, motivation and expertise.
Being a mature learner it was important to me that my instructor kept his cool especially when I needed it most.
I highly recommend "The Way Driving School",  to those getting their license for the first time,  at every age,  and those having to retest!
This is definitely "THE WAY TO GO! "<//review>

The way driving school owner Luis and Jay ( instructor) are very friendly and have great experience. I took a session with them and I learned that just driving alone doesn't earn you the license, you need to have that extra good driving skills. And I totally believe that these guys help you build up those skills to be a good driver. They also have good cars and are very punctual about time. I would surely recommend them. :)< /Text>

I got to know about The Way Driving school from my friend. I took a two hour practice session just to start with and I found it really helpful! The instructor Jay exactly knew and told what was needed for me to perform better at the test. I also went to my practice test taking their vehicle at San Clemente DMV. The instructor Luis told me important tips and that really helped me passing the test in the first go! I would definitely recommend this driving school to my friends. Keep up the good work guys! 👍< /text>

<Review>Adel, of The Way Driving School was very courteous and patient with both of our kids.  He was always on time, the kids enjoyed driving lessons with him, and we always got feedback on what they were doing right and what they needed to improve or practice on.  He was recommended to us by the neighbor up the street who had 2 of their kids drive with him too.<//Review>< response>

<response>None</response><review>WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  UNPROFESSIONAL TRAINER dressed like a bump!
I have several children taking driving lessons during their HS Jr. & Sr. years.  This company is $80 MORE THAN my previous driving school.  When my baby wants a lesson, she won’t wait, though our formal driving school had no openings.  I called this place & was able to book the 1st lesson the immediate weekend.  Owner Lewis was very pleasant the 1st time, however, the 1st trainer didn’t communicate to confirm our appointment the day before, plus arrived late without calling us prior to arrival or apologizing his tardiness.  Meanwhile ending lesson early on us.  20 minutes before our 2nd Driving Lesson, I called Lewis about our uncertainty whether trainer Jorge will be late or forgot about our lesson.  Lewis was defensive for his trainer, then he agreed to contact that trainer on no confirmation of our lesson.  Lewis said it’s not his trainer cut short in lessons but, they offered 45 minutes lesson per hour; therefore, his school actual driving lesson is only 1.5 hours and NOT 2 Hours Per DMV requirements.  So 6 hours driving lessons we paid for is only getting 4.5 hours total ACTUAL LESSONS. I was shocked, had never heard that from other driving schools I encountered.  Jorge, the trainer, showed up with sloppy shirt & paints, talked to me disrespectfully before the lesson and was rude to my daughter.  Before lesson, he said just have student practice driving then student will get it herself.  In that case, WHY DO WE TAKE LESSON FROM HIM IF HE DIN’T PLAN TO TEACH!!!  WOW!  He used ORANGE to describe “Roundabout Road” without explaining what he was indicating, short in communication with student, didn’t sign any paper or provide us a report on what he taught the student & / or what needs to be practice more.  My daughter felt the lesson was a total waste of time.  No teaching on parking or tip on precaution rules.

DO YOU WANT YOUR STUDENTS TO LEARN FROM TRAINER OR JUST HAVE TRAINER SIT BY STUDENT TO KILL TIME, SO STUDENTS CAN COLLECT THE signed papers to show DMV 6 hours REQUIREMENT fulfilled?  I’m concerned on their INTEGRITY, QUALITY OF TRAINER, SAFETY of female students, and commercialized operations for making money as business NOT EDUCATIONAL school for benefit of students and their safety in driving.  Will call DMV to clarify their 6 hours driving lesson requirements.< /review>< Pics>

Luis was an excellent driving instructor and an English and Spanish teacher too!!! Since the first lesson he made me feel confident and safe. I had an international driving license from Spain and I needed to get my California driver's license as soon as possible. He was very clear from the beginning and helped me to understand the american way of driving and the rules. Very supportive and a lot of fun! Luis was very professinal on the phone and committed to the lessons. I think the price was very good for the quality of the lessons. The lesson before the exam was very useful as we covered all the places the examiner took me so I passed the exam with no mistakes!!!. I highly recommend The Way driving School!!!< /review>

This is a story about a young man and his everlasting journey to acquire his drivers licence. On the morning of Wednesday October 12th a man by the name of Louis arrived at my house and took me on a journey to practice my driving skills and see how I can improve on my ability to drive a vehicle from one point to another. At first I had some discomfort with my seat but eventally got it to the right setting i was most comfortable with. Throughout this particular driving session we started to have conversations of the most interesting variety, including but not limited to our daily lives, our hobbies, family and whatever else crossed though our thoughts. I went through many trials such as the dreaded U turn, changing the lanes and most of all getting used to the stiffness of the breaks in the vehicle I was operating. Every one of these trials and tribulations I conquered with the greatest of patience and ease. Having honed my skills I hopefully get closer and closer to reaching my goal of finally obtaining a driver's license and being able to get around more efficiently. Long story short this place is great!<//text>

He tought me basic introduction by knowing interior parts or the car and the uses of it.  Then my second and the last lesson with with Sir Luiz, he's so serious with comes of teaching, he always correct me when every time I got wrong.  He always remind me that LIFE is not all about sorry.  You should be responsible drinver that's what I learn from him.  Although, I almost killed him three times for my 1St lesson with him but he didn't give up on me. He is just a very professional instructor it becomes of teaching his students.

<review>Love, love, love them. I’ve been bringing my pet here since I got her and I’ve always felt very welcomed. You get a sense of family, when I moved to Ventura, I tried other vets, but I felt like I was nothing but another number to them. So, I make the drive to Carpinteria because my pet deserves the best care. Dr. Smith is amazing, he explains everything clearly and offers other locations that may be cheaper if a procedure is a bit pricy. Every time I call, Liz automatically knows who I’m calling about, there’s no need for me to give too much information.</review>< pics>

When we first moved to Santa Barbara I got a recommendation for Dr Smith. We took our little rescue, Lenny, to him and I liked him. He didn't push unnecessary treatments. A few months later Lenny had his first seizure. I wasn't familiar with seizures and didn't know what to do. I thought I'd call the Dr's office although it was 9:30 at night. I figured I would get a recording and a recommendation for an emergency animal hospital. Instead Dr. Smith answered the phone. He said they couldn't do anything for him at the emergency room and that Lenny should calm down in 5 to 10 minutes. He walked me through what was going on and stayed with me until Lenny calmed down. I couldn't have asked for better service.<//review>

<Text>LOVE Animal Medical Clinic! They treat my little tyrant with care and grace. We started with them during Covid and the staff has always been safe and responsive to our needs.

They are fairly priced, compassionate, professional, and very responsive to the needs of my white, allergy prone dog.

I brought in our family cat to be put down and the staff was absolutely wonderful. Kind, patient, and caring.

They house strays that get picked up and actively try to find the owners or rehome before sending to the shelter. My heart bursts! Love them all!</Text></record>

Great service. Good value. Very nice staff. Visiting the vet is even easier now than ever! They completely take care of your pet for you (as you can't enter the building with your pet right now) and make it as pleasant an experience as it can be!<//text>

Everyone at the clinic is dedicated. And, not price gouging, but still taking very good care of my pets, even when they were at their end of life. And now, my puppy loves going there to see everyone.<//Review>

I’ve been following Dr. Oliver around Santa Barbara since 2008. She is an amazing, caring, compassionate vet and human. Even tho it is a bit of a drive for me now to take my pets to Carp. i would not choose to take them anywhere else. I am thrilled that Dr. Oliver is at the Animal Medical clinic, the whole team is amazing. They all truly care about providing loving care for the animals. Each and everyone of the staff, from reception to techs and vets are welcoming, professional, warm, sweet and caring for both the animals and the owners. Everyone has a “can do” attitude and everyone delivers first rate service. I would recommend Animal Medical Clinic and Dr. Adrienne Oliver to anyone looking for an excellent vet a supportive environment and a wonderful experience. Top Notch!!<//Text>

This team has given me extra time with my cat and for the past 3 1/2, years has taken great care with my dog, helping him live into his Golden years. The staff is patient and kind, providing excellent and timely assistance. The doctors spend as much time as I need, explaining whatever is presented. It’s been a long journey with cancer and heart disease. It’s a scary road but with a good partner like AVS, I have been blessed with time.

Very bad experience if you have a small puppy don’t even go to them, they have no experience and don’t know what they are doing. After charging me over $500 still don’t know what is wrong with my boy and keep saying they have no diagnosis. I called my breeder and right away she told me what to do and what to give him since he wasn’t eating for 3 days.
These people only care about money not these poor animals!</text>

Dr. Smith took care of our 20 year old difficult kitty for the last 18 years of her life. He would always come up with the best plan to get her taken care of, and it wasn't easy! Now Animal Medical will be taking care of the health of our new kittens. We are always happy with the care our fur babies receive there.<//Review>

They have always been sweet and kind to me and my animals. I have had 2 cats live past 20 years and both were patients here. Recently had to put down my cat Buddy, they were flexible with my work schedule. The doctor was able to go through with the procedure with minimal notice, even after I was struggling throughout the day with the decision.<//Text>

< Review>
The staff at Animal Medical Clinic  are  the best!   They are friendly and very importantly, knowledgeable.  I cannot say enough about Dr Scott's love of his patients  -  and his determination to get to the bottom of the most challenging cases.   The staff are always ready to go the extra mile as well.  Love them  -  from a lifetime client!<//Review>

I will never forget Dr Smith's kindness in making a house call at 10:00 PM, on a holiday weekend, to help release my girl out of her failing body. It meant the world to me that I could give her this final gift of love.

<review>My family and I had a wonderful experience here. The atmosphere was perfect and the waitress was super friendly. It dark and candlelit  very romantic but also somehow worked for the family as well. Arman was playing guitar and singing and interacted with our children beautifully. He was very talented and knew how to hold a perfect volume. Everybody's dish was delicious. I wish George's was in the Bay Area. I'd actually give more than 5 stars if I could.< /review>< Pictures>

Cheap, stale dough for several years.
Pizza dough is like chewing tree bark.  So rough it it actually scrapes the inside of my mouth - lol.  Way over priced too.</Review>

Ambience is cozy with live music. Price is high, service is good. I would probably give 3.5. I am all about supporting local business and would definitely recommend but not sure I can justify the price other than to support local business. I would probably visit once every 3 months compared to other restaurants where I would go once every 2 weeks.<//Review><UserId.>117845101737353031855</UserId.><Rating>3</Rating></record>

<Name>Soseh Khachturian< /Name><text>Really great food and really great customer service. We tried their mozzarella sticks, spicy wings (highly highly recommend), zucchini sticks and a bruschetta type of thing which was very very good! We tried 3 different wines (2 Cabernet Sauvignons and 1 Pinot Grigio) and they were all delicious.
For the main dish we ordered a few and shared. We ordered the gnocchi dish (very tasty), the seafood linguine (my favorite out of all the amazing tasting food), and chicken Alfredo pasta (chicken was crispy and yummy). It was out first time here and definitely not our last. I'm excited to find this gem in Glendale!<//text><user_id>110238447370593279615< /user_id><pics>None<//pics></record>

Food tastes great.  Pricing messed with our experience. Ask about every price, because...  The menu pricing is subject to change and doesn't match this Google menu. Cheesecake is really $4.50.  Shrimp (6qty) is now $11</Review>

Honestly my girlfriend and I have dubbed this the best itialian restaurant we've ever been to. Small but quaint and cozy. Staff is super nice food is fresh  and fair priced. Been there twice one as a walk in one with reservation. Each time has had live jazz music setting the mood for a very romantic atmosphere. The wine is great and the price is the best I've seen at any restaurant. Keep it up u have two regulars for life.</review>

I have lived in the neighborhood for years and I had my first meal there a month ago. In the last month I have eaten there three times. The sandwiches are perfect and filling. They have fantastic pizza (thin crust is great) with great toppings. I will have to say that my favorite thing they have are hot wings. The wings are a good size, they have just the right amount of crispy texture to it and the hot sauce is just right, not overbearing in the last.<//text>

<text>George's Cucina Italiana is one of the best authentic Italian restaurants in Southern California. Hidden like a well kept secret in the foot hills of north west Glendale. Love their pizzas especially the Margarita, 😋😘 beautiful atmosphere, and a nice selection of fine wines. One of my favorite dishes is the white baked ziti. If only they had more of a weekly music selection I would rate this a next to perfect. Shhhhh, ok 🥂🥰<//text><pics>None</pics><date>1574478102806< /date>< rate>

Try out a new restaurant near me. Order chicken alfredo over the phone. Just check my pasta, and it still looks good even though they gave me no chicken. 😃 The sauce was watery, and lacked flavor. I'm sticking with Mario's, cheaper and way more flavorful at a great price.</review>

It's Italian comfort food and obviously not Italian owned.

But the saxophone player on Friday nights is good and the waitresses are very nice.
Their pizza and pasta is pretty good.
Good little spot.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Used to love this place, last 2 times the food was horrible we tried large pizza on last visit, tasteless and look like they splash water on it,
Few weeks ago we had chiken wings and philly cheese sandwiches and it was very dry wings and sandwiches had hardly meat in it and taste like green pepper from start to finish. Never again.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
Really disappointing - the Caprese salad had cheese and tomato as expected but no basil, instead the greatest part of the salad was iceberg lettuce. The garlic bread was nice bread with a scattering of herbs but very little or no garlic. The Mexican pizza was really bad–the toppings may have been okay if they had not been made impossible to taste by the amount of very spicy seasoning (possibly chilli flakes?) which masked the taste of everything else. Although we would like to support local enterprises, there is no point in supporting sub-standard offerings.< /review>

Went here on the recommendation of a friend while I was in town from SLC.
Awesome little restaurant with the best Italian food I've had.
Will return everytime I'm in town!

< Review>
The food was good and the service was average. The decor reminded me of a warehouse. But what really ticked us off was the policy of adding sales tax on a required 18% tip. Talk about insult on top of injury!<//Review>

They mess up my order all of the time. Last time I went they messed it up and I nicely asked them to fix it when the lady at the desk refused to. & The delivery takes forever minimum of an hour.</review>

My wife and I were looking for a LA Z BOY rocking recliner for our master bedroom. We wanted it ASAP. Our sales lady, Martine listened to our needs and showed us recliners that we’re immediately available and appropriate for large/tall individuals. We selected a leather recliner that met all of our needs and it was on sale! Both the style, quality and price exceeded our expectations.<//text>

I had a great experience with La-Z-Boy from the time I walked into the store until the day of my delivery! Everyone was extremely nice and had a genuine concern to make sure that I was pleased with their service as well as the quality of their product.<//Review>

<review>I came in looking for a smaller, regular-chair-looking recliner for my new, downsized home. I wanted something from on the floor because my arthritic joints couldn’t wait for six months for a special order. Chyna was very helpful. She showed me the three available chairs and helped me think through the colors, fabric, and prints from a decorator’s point of view. I made a selection that I am happy about, and the chair will be delivered in less than a week. Overall, the chairs were beautiful and comfortable, and Chyna was knowledgable and personable.  It was a great experience!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

We went in looking for a new sofa, one that was also Had a couple of recliners.

As we entered we were greeted by Audrey, a sales associate of La-Z-Boy furniture.

We told her what we had in mind and she graciously showed us a number of options to consider with regards to what we were shopping for.

We ultimately settled on a very nice sofa/recliner, and we were able to get it delivered within a week’s time of the purchase.

At no time did we ever feel pressured or bothered by Audrey, and in fact, all the sales associates were very kind and gracious.</Review>

I haven't received my couch yet, just ordered it,  but the shopping experience at the Agoura Hills store was so easy and pleasant.  Greg was helpful and knowledgeable and not pushy. Hope I love my sleeper sofa as much ss I expect to!<//Review>

<review>We were looking for a recliner sofa. Deja Lovely met us at the door, directed us to the str and basically gave us plenty of time to test what we liked. We found 2 and she was very informative about the differences and options. We love what we bought, there was a huge sale going on and we are thrilled with the experience.</review>< Time>

Deja was our sales representative. She was polite and their but not in our face. Once we picked a few pieces we liked she began to ask open ended questions which helped us narrow our choice to exactly what we wanted

I would highly recommend the store and the personnel</text>

<time>1609556679794< /time><Pics>None< /Pics><name>the Baraness<//name><Review>With our rambunctious toddler in tow, we sought the services of a furniture expert and an interior designer, Deja. We did not have a floor plan or any of the rooms measured and yet she was able to create a 3-D floorplan using images I had taken of our new home. She painstakingly took her time to make sure each piece was in stock and will arrive by the time we are slated to move in.

She also took the time to talk to me about fabric colors and how to match honey oak trim with fabrics. She reviewed the type of flooring and colors of flooring to consider.

Deja was helpful beyond measure. Her manager Greg was quoted fastidious in making sure our order was complete and he had to double check on a series of items and this involved multiple phone calls and time on his part. I am so pleased! Once we move, I’ll call back for additional pieces. Our place requires repairs and finances are tight, but this experience was painless! Love this place!< /Review></record>

It couldn't have been a better experience... a cool and pleasant showroom, welcoming staff wearing masks, and no pressure to buy. It gave us a chance to try things out and ended up buying a great recliner.<//Text>

<review>Went in the store because of the 30% off sale.
Found a   lazy Boy recliner I liked. When I went to purchase I was told it would be $100 to deliver one recliner to my home .... or $40 to deliver it to the store?!? What?!
I am ordering this exact recliner from Wayfair, for less than the 30% off price , with FREE delivery....

Audrey at the Agoura Hills location is perfection. I just had surgery and am requiring a chair to help me recover. She had just the right balance of assisting my husband and I and leaving us alone to play Goldilocks! We couldn’t recommend her more. And we found the perfect chair😊

< Review>
My experience  was disappointing.  Lazy Boy has ads that their recliners are on sale but when you get there they don’t have the “one” available that is on sale and if you happen to want a different color it’s several hundred dollars more and you have to wait 16 weeks for it to be ready
Since this was to be a Christmas gift I finally found ONe that actually was “in stock” and might work so I decided to buy it.  BUT if/when my husband didn’t like it, there is a 30% restocking fee and they won’t give me my money back. I only get a store credit.
It’s a ridiculous policy and I would not recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

On site Mgr Dan was very helpful but I have little confidence in the Lazy-Boy guarantee of service. Ive waited weeks for Service to call me andmake an appt. and had to drive to the store to get anywhere . I have also emailed LazyBoy , but no response. Dan guarantees me a response now , i. 48 hrs from 11/17. We’ll see.

Well it is now end of day Nov 23 and no one has contacted me to arrange an appointment to repair my chair . Very disappointing.</review>

<review>We walked in to the Agoura Hills store for the first time yesterday looking for a sectional. Never having been in the store, we weren’t quite sure what to expect.
Joy Maglinao greeted us within 30 seconds and was such a knowledgeable salesperson! She showed us all of the different options we were interested in. She made our experience so great!
We weren’t totally sold when we walked in but with her help and guidance, we were sold by the end!
Joy is a valuable salesperson and we were stoked to meet her!< /review>< pictures>

I can not use this chair.  If I sit correctly in the chair, my feet don't touch the floor.  And because my feet dont' touch the floor - I also can't recline.  The material in the front of the chair protrudes and that affects how my legs "dangle".

I visited the Lazy Boy store in Agoura Hills, CA seeking a comprehensive experience in updating my furniture. Jeremiah and Natalie were fantastic and steered in the proper direction with design support. Natalie came to my home and identified the perfect selection of furnishings to redo my living room, family room, eating nook and master bedroom. I can’t wait to see the finished design once the furniture is delivered. Appreciate Natalies attention to detail and outstanding advice and guidance!< /text>

The salesperson, Chynah was very helpful and thorough in the process of the purchase of a rocking recliner.  She explained the various options available and the various elements of the warranty clearly.  Because the transaction was exclusively over the phone she also sent me pictures of the fabric color for the chair and promptly sent an invoice and warranty via email.<//review>

The salesperson was good, other employees are unfriendly. Manager Greg, in fact, was curt and seemed to resent being bothered. Considering money's especially tight for some of us and retail's supposedly struggling right now, he seemed unappreciative of the thousands of dollars just spent in his store. Perhaps he (and others) could use a refresher course in customer service.<//Text>

We received top shelf service, when we left, my wife said " this was a good call."

Thank you!

Great quality of furniture and great customer
service. I had a concern about an item I bought and the matter was remedied over the phone in 30 min. I highly recommend  the company and the design team, Ethan Geeenfield from the Agoura store - a master at his craft!<//Review>

We spent a lot of time looking at different sofas. Our salesperson Jeramiah was very patient and knowledgeable.  We decided to leave and come back another day to make the purchase. There was no pressure to make the sale the first day. Our actual purchase was quick and painless.<//text>

So I purchased a sectional sofa from another less expensive store and within 6 months my dogs thrashed them. They did not hold up like my La-Z-Boy sofas did. So, I am throwing away the sectional & I purchased new La-Z-Boy furniture. Plus the sales person was so sweet. She made my purchase so easy. I would definitely recommend La-Z-Boy to my friends and family.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I had the worst experience with my online order with La-Z-boy. When they confirmed my order by phone, Greg (who I believe is from the Agoura Hills location) had informed me that the recliner I ordered will take 5-7 weeks to build. I didn’t mind the wait. But a couple of weeks later, Greg calls again to let me know that the beige fabric is out of stock. The only colors available were navy blue, dark brown and gray, none of which was close to the original fabric color I ordered. He added I would have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more to get the color I want. I truly believe that this mishap by La-Z-boy should not cost the customer more money. I asked Greg if I could speak with someone who could look into the issue. He tells me he is the supervisor and he is the person to speak to. He also said “I don’t want to be rude, but I’m just repeating myself”. He sounded so annoyed by my request to speak to someone else. Finally, he gave me a 877 number for customer care. The customer care representative was really nice and gave me assurance that they will match my color and made me feel satisfied with my order. This turned out to be false hope as only 2 hours later, I received an email telling me that my order has been canceled.

It’s appalling how incompetent La-Z-boy customer service has been. After spending hours on the phone with them, no one has explained how the error happened and the company gave limited options to complete my purchase. It was either get the color you don’t want or cancel. They really didn’t care.

In the end, Greg called me to check what I’ve decided. Now, realizing no one will try to keep me happy as a customer, I went ahead with the order and settled. Greg was still nasty over the phone. I asked if the online discount will still be applied and his response, “Yes, I just said that”. I can’t believe the attitude of this guy specially with the fact that they’ve screwed up. If he is in fact the head of my local store location, he deserves a demotion in my opinion.

I would NEVER ever do business with LA-Z-Boy again.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Eric is seriously the absolute best employee this company has to offer. He is not only compassionate and personable, he is totally professional. Customer service sucks these days, so it’s really nice that someone actually cares. He went above and beyond helping me, and I am very grateful and relieved to know that people like Eric will treat customers with the care and compassion they deserve.<//review>

I have always purchased lazy boy recliners as I like the warranty on the mechanism plus they are made in the USA. However when I purchased two recliners recently, I wasn’t pleased with the experience as I felt both the salesperson plus the store manager had “take it or leave it” attitudes instead of trying to address my concerns satisfactorily.</Text>

<review>Audrey was very helpful in explaining various fabrics for the sofa that we were interested in.  She was helpful and attentive without being intrusive while my husband and I made up our minds. The employees were congenial and efficient.  My husband and I enjoy shopping at LaZ boy. They have a nice selection of furniture styles and also a nice selection of fabrics and accessories.  Good experience shopping there!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< time>

When I heard what you did for my friends by putting that recliner in your car and leaving your office in the middle of the day and going 30 miles round-trip so that he would have that after brain surgery, I was shocked.
Your empathy and compassion really moved me.This has been trying on all of us and you were the angel that picked us up today when we were overwhelmed.

Great help to find exactly what we wanted. Price and financing were good.  I’d like customized items to happen in 3-4 weeks. Also we did not know we had to put 50% down to get a custom order until we were ready to pay. Almost had to back out. But overall the experience was good.< /Review>

When paying for my purchase salesperson put on a $40 fee for customer pick up.  I was astounded by this.  I'm buying a small table to take with me and I'm supposed to pay to take it!!  I refused to pay this fee and the manager (who has little to no people skills) did take the fee off.  btw: if you are going to charge a customer such a fee, don't just tack it on when processing the credit card and then give the slip to sign. Say something.  The salesperson processed a credit for that fee, and I'm waiting to see it on my credit card statement.  In addition it takes way too long to process a sale.   I'm unlikely to ever walk in this store again, my friend who was with me, said the same . La-Z-Boy  lost two customers.</review>

<text>We bought a Pinnacle Lift Platinum Recliner in Nov of 2017 for my wife who can no longer get out of a standard chair, after just passed a year the Leg Rest wouldn't go down, the store says they won't fix it or even send someone out to analyze the problem, only that its out of warranty and that I would have to call the home office which I did getting no help except to refer me to a third party for our extended service policy which we paid an additional $500 for.  We are now into the chair aprox. $3000 and get nothing but buck passing, needless to say this will be the last product we pay a premium price for in a Lazy Boy showroom.  The most help so far is for us to analyze the  problem to determine if its a electrical or mechanical problem and call again.

Erick took time with Sister and me by listening to requests and needs.  He showed us many different styles to accommodate Sister’s needs.  We were impressed either his kindness and courtesy and time he took with us.  We never were made to feel that we had to hurry. My experience with Erick and Lazy-boy were very positive.  We will be back.<//Review>

< review>
One of my best friends of 43 years had brain surgery 72 hours ago and was being released to come home today and the doctor said he needed a recliner which he didn’t have at home.
When I called to order him one and have one delivered to his house, the next delivery date was Tuesday ( today’s Thursday ).

The problem is, that if he lays down  and falls asleep, even for a few minutes, the fluid could cause inflammation and he could have a stroke and die.

So I asked to speak to the manager Eric because I was deflated and desperate.
I was met with a kindness and compassion that rarely exists today, He told me he would put the recliner in his car when his other co-worker came in at 11:30 because he couldn’t leave the store with only one employee.

Thank you Eric for delivering the chair today, you are a very kind soul and all of us appreciated it more than you know!!!<//review>

It took 4 replacement deliveries to get my chairs CLOSE to acceptable.  Im still waiting on a call to have a technician come out and remove the wrinkles in the one delivered last week.

Too much time and effort required on part of customer (me) to do business again.

Eric at the local store (Agoura CA 91301)  was the only shining light for your company.  He truly understands Customer Relations.  He should get a raise.<//text>

Would be 5* but the sales associate was kind of rude. I was asking him questions about the price and financing and he literally told me " I dont know. Its %13 of your total. You have a calculator on your phone, you do the math. I cant do that kind of math right now". He also did not offer or discuss other financing options other then the one year. I just felt like he wanted to be done with us, even though we were buying an expensive piece.  Will most likely look somewhere else for new couches after this. This is not my first bad experence with them. I was trying to give them another chance, but I've learned my lesson. Never again.</text>

<text>Advertising is deceptive with “Starting at;” so beware. The recliner I bought did not match the advertised pricing for the same chair.

If I buy a mattress, washer/dryer, refrigerator, etc; they deliver and take-away the one being replaced. La-Z-Boy will not take-away the Recliner we are replacing when they deliver the new recliner.  “We used to,” they tell me. “But now we don’t,” they reply. Now I need a truck and a couple strong fellows.

Not my idea of good customer service.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80e82135b1adcf41:0x7f9e00a71861a934</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great experience from working with Eric (Salesman) to Yessenia (Design Manager).  The 3D view of our room with furniture options was phenomenal.   Eric was fantastic.  Eric looked out for our wants and needs and showed us a variety of options.  Extremely happy with the service and we cannot wait to get our sectional and recliners deliveres.<//review>

I love my new recliner and like the electronic buttons. The color is beautiful. The chair is a dream to sit or nap or rock in! The service in the store was great.<//text>

We had a very good buying experience at this LazyBoy store in Agoura. The woman who helped us, Yessenia,  was very good at answering our questions and guiding us to just the right sofa and chair that we were looking for.  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.</Review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>Great service until the very end! After paying over 4,000 the sales rep says I forgot your couche can't be delivered until the end of August and the two chairs in September!! At that point what choice do I have!!? I said that's too long and she just asked if I would like the floor model with a discount we bought the floor model and it should have been delivered July 12th!! Get a call to days before July 12th saying that my couch will be delivered between 8 and 11. Got a call July 12th from the warehouse my couches are still on the floor of Lazy Boy and cannot be delivered today. With that being said I've already gotten rid of my old couch!! The warehouse can now deliver my couch on the 17th of July!! Very poor service from Lazy Boy!! Some kind of miscommunication between the furniture store & the warehouse and customers!!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Return policy is the worst in the business..how can can you know a recliner will be perfect for room unless you try it out in your own living room... returned a 299.00 recliner and the charged me 30% restock fee..$90.00 dollars and a $100 delivery fee..I thought I would be treated fairly but found out La-Z-Boy Furniture doesn't know the meaning of FAIR...they really don't care if you bring your business back to them...they have attitude if you don't like their Rip-off policy go somewhere else if you want FAIR..we are in it to make money on you, we don't care if your happy with your purchase..they have a 50/50 return policy if you don't like your purchase we will give you 50% of your purchase back even if you didn't sit on chair...and will charge you another $100.oo pick-up delivery fee..I don't like the second recliner from them, I would like to exchange it also but 30% of 499.00 is $150.00 restock fee 3 days after they delivered it, and another $100.00 pickup fee..please save your self a headache and don't buy from LA-Z-BOY in Aguora Hills they truly are the worst place I ever bought furniture from..Find A Bassett Furniture Store I think you will be much happier... Merry Christmas La-Z-Boy thanks for being very unreasonable with your delivery fees, what happen to the good old days when you bought a piece of furniture and they delivered for free...just unbelievable poor customer service...I don't know how they stay in business..I take that back, they make a ton of money on delivery fee and 30% re-stock fee...they just don't care, shame on me, I should have known something was not good when I was the only customer in store on a Saturday afternoon..hard lesson to learn..< /Review><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Came in on a Sunday, Audie helped me find the right unit to store my personal collection item. She let me examine the unit and measure it out before inquiring about the unit. Explained to me the features and security systems in place to protect my assets and how the gates work. Was very helpful from minute 1 to finishing up the set up! I met the whole staff getting my unit and Marisela and Audie hooked me up with the last available unit! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a storage unit to protect high value assets!< /Text>< userid>

<Review>I’m totally impressed with the customer service I was given by Anita. She made my husband and I welcome  and she explained in detail the availability of size units and prices.

Just got a storage and Audie was so welcoming and friendly from the beginning. She gave us a tour, to the storages she had in mind that could be the best fit, and explained everything in detail. My wife and I are very pleased with the service.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Marcella has been an excellent ambassador for your organization.
She was able to locate and help me secure a storage unit to meet my needs.   She communicated clearly and immediately.
Although I was unable to visit the facility immediately she was creative and help me secure the space until I could arrive.
I hope all your associates are as responsive.
FOLLOW-UP - Upon finally delivering my vehicle to the Storage Facility, we were met by two smiling and very pleasant young Ladies,  Marcella and Audi.    My wife arrived before me and they made her feel Welcomed and catered to her until I was able to arrive.   I so appreciate them making my wife feel comfortable in an unfamiliar city and location.    They made my wife feel so very Special, which in turn made me feel even Better about choosing your location.    They then escorted me to my assigned storage unit and assisted as I parked my vehicle.
Thank You StorQuest
May all your associates be a pleasant and knowledgably.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

The office didn't tell me about it until I saw the damage and went to the office and asked about it.  The only other issue I have is that we pre-paid for 1 year to ensure the monthly rental rate.  After 9 months we had to leave the area. While I gave the required 30 days notice I was told that because I pre-paid I would not receive a refund for the 3 months we wouldn't be using the space.  Then 3 months later we received a bill for the next months rent.< /Text>< pics>

Customer Service Rep. by the name of
Maricela Garcia handled my transaction for the rental of a storage unit. The transaction went smoothly and she took every precaution that deals with the Covid 19 pandemic and showed nothing but professionalism. She quickly got me in and out after taking me through the grounds which impressed me due  to the cleanliness and well maintained property.
She was well groomed, talked with knowledge and very courteous. The efficiency was well appreciated .  I would highly recommend this facility and hopefully all other employees are as capable of coming across as business like as Maricela the Store Manager. I will definitely spread this news all over town as I am very well known in the community

Staff was helpful from initial call inquiring about AC-climate controlled units. Marisela was very professional, courteous, and helpful through entire process of moving items in, lock/security process, and answering any last minute questions. Would strongly recommend venue as it is quick access from Indio Blvd., and staff is extremely professional.<//review>

<review>I visited this location on Monday to check it out and grab some information and was greeted by Audie who HANDS DOWN not only provided me THE BEST customer service of any storage place I visited that day, but overall best service that I've gotten from any business in a while.  Personable and informative she was able to answer all my questions and put any concerns to rest. Employees like her are what make companies stand out and last in these tough times. StorQuest will be seeing my business soon.</review><gmap_id>0x80daf7bfcf03f0f7:0x367c4a817d95ec0f< /gmap_id><Response>{'time': 1592388898668, 'text': 'Ruben, we strive for 100% satisfaction, and it is great to see you had such a positive experience at StorQuest Self Storage.

Maricela at StoreQuest in Indio was very Professional. The Facility is very clean and I am quite satisfied. Maricela was very proactive and did everything possible to make this experience simple. I would recommend StorQuest and Maricela in particular to anyone interested in renting space!<//Review>

Needed a storage fast. Walked into the store and the ladies were busy but Raylien greeted us right away. She showed us a great unit for our stuff and she was very knowledgeable and polite. I love that they have two managers on site. Thank you!< /review>

There was alot of sand and dirt that came in under the door. If there was a way to seal the bottom of the door, that would be so much better.

Otherwise, I had no problems at all. Nice office staff and great location.<//Review>

<review>Maricela, her sister & husband were always so kind & very helpful over the 3 years of time I stored with them! I can't recommend them more highly. I'd give 10 stars if I had the option (so I just did by SAYING so). :-) They even answered my call after hours to help me when my car battery died. They are wonderful people! I also never had any trouble with any of my belongings or access to the storage facility. They were very accommodating.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I’ve been a customer at this facility for most of the past 11 years, and I’ve had the pleasure of working with 3 different site managers. I worked with the best of those 3 today - Maricela Dorantes. She was exceptionally helpful in finding a solution to my storage needs, and I found her professionalism and demeanor to be outstanding. I would recommend Maricela and StorQuest-Indio to anyone. She, and it, are top-notch.< /Review><UserId.>107861780954796427684</UserId.><name>Rick Beal<//name><rate>5</rate>< Gmap_id>

I would recommend Storquest Self Storage to anyone looking for a clean & safe place for storage. Dina is an excellent property manager & will help you figure out the right size needed.

The other day, my wife and I drove out to Indio to rent a storage unit from Los Angeles. It was a long drive and we were in a big hurry and had to get back near home for an appointment. Thanks to Andrea, we made it to that appointment. She promptly showed us our new clean unit and had our contract ready without skipping a beat. She is a very pleasant and cheerful young lady who can work fast at the same time. I have rented many storage units in the past and have never had the same experience. Thank you Andrea.

Raylien met me in the office on my first visit there. She was very pleasant and helpful, taking me for a tour, answering all my questions and she was most efficient in assisting me with the rental process. She politely managed other customers who can in while we were signing the papers while at the same time asking them to allow her to complete our transaction.
I was very impressed

<text>Marisela and Audie are such great gals. They made my first visit to Storquest a welcoming experience.
Storquest is very clean and conveniently organized.  The driveways are comfortably wide.  It's nice that I don't have to squeeze my car through the facility,  unlike other storage facilities.
I got a very nice  'vibe' when I first went there. I trust that it's because the place is so well maintained by terrific people.
The rents are reasonable, too.
I very highly recommend Storquest in Indio.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Letty Lozano has been really helpful. She helped my mother and I. We were able to find top quality storage containers. She provided really good information about the containers mainly because of our current situation. We had to kove out within a week and she was fast and we where able to get these containers quick so we can put our things before moving. Im really greatful for there service. I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a storage container. Thank you.</text>< Rate>

Recently rented a 10x15 unit via the website. As I pull in I go in the office to be sure everything was good. Cone to find out I had rented the wrong unit and had to have it changed. The gals in the office, Andrea and sorry can't recall the other gals name, did everything they can do to get me in a different unit. After a couple trips to check to be sure the units available were cleaned, I had my unit. I appreciate all the help and hard work these gals did so I could unload my trailer before it was due back at uhaul at no extra charge.  Thank you gals... Julian Rangel<//review>

The lady at the front desk is such a great person that repersents your business very well. I have known her for several years and she is kind , helpful and knowledgeable. She is a good asset for the company and is bilingual as your business in the Coachella Valley has a higher percentage of Hispanic background 😳 The employee is named , Marcella I hope I have spelled it correctly..Thank you Pink< /Text>

<Review>Poor service I have rented 3 units few months ago from the previous Manager she was the sweetest thing ever and I wrote a review with 5 stars from my first experience but I had to change it for my recent visit to Storquest I went in couple of days ago to get 3 Units the office was closed for more than a hour and when the lady came I told her that I rented here before and wanted to see what kind of promos you guys have she answered me with a very bad attitude she was nothing but rude to me for some reason 👎🏻</Review><gmap_id>0x80daf7bfcf03f0f7:0x367c4a817d95ec0f</gmap_id>< date>

Dear sirs,

My wife and  I have been tenants for the past 6 years at StorQuest, indio, Ca

We are extremely pleased with the service that your office team provides to the public Maricela and Raylien.

The Indio facility is convient, not only in location, but hours made available to accomodate the working individuals.  This safe, well lite and clean facility is highly recomended to new tenants looking to store their belongings.

Respectfully

Joe Arce<//text>

Great price in the valley. I checked different storage facilities in the Indio and Coachella area before making my decision. The big decision factor was the manager Dina. I reserved a storage online and upon arriving to her office she greeted me with a smile. She showed me around the facility before showing me my storage just to get a feel of the facility before I made my decision. Dina then showed me my storage that I had reserved and asked me if I liked it if not she can show me a different storage. I said yes, if she could show me a different storage and without hesitation, she did. All and all it was a great experience both on the phone and in person. Definitely recommend doing business with Storquest in Indio.
