Just get omakase and let the chef handle it. It’s a stress free experience. It is quite pricey, the two of us spent over $300 after tax and tip but the quality was excellent. For a special occasion, it’s definitely worth it.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bff60b793cd5:0x5f252e13a3171147</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Almost don’t want to review, lest the secret get out! Truly outstanding sushi. I challenge you to find better in the $50-100 price range. Will definitely become a regular here.<//review>< pics>

Very traditional “omakase” sushi bar experience right here in the Rancho district. Staff speaks minimal English, the prices are high, the decor rustic and a bit dusty. But it is VERY GOOD! Chef will serve you a nice variety of small plates, advise you what sauce to use for each and what each is called. Fair warning: if you’re not careful, you could easily drop $150 per person in a hour of steady eating and drinking. You can always choose to sit at a booth and order a la carte to keep total costs down a bit.< /review>

<review>If you want real authentic Japanese sushi this place is a must try. They have absolutely no rolls, which is exactly what you want from an authentic Japanese sushi spot. It's all sushi pieces and it's hands down the most fresh and amazing sushi I've ever had.</review>< pics>

<Text>Don't let the claims on the site and in the shop scare you off. An order sheet will be provided and you will get to select what it is that you want. If there is a way to let the chef choose what you get...it is a well kept and discreet secret. And you should come to try and unearth the secret, the quality was excellent.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bff60b793cd5:0x5f252e13a3171147<//GmapID></record>

<Review>A quaint space with a calm and cozy vibe. I was greeted by a friendly waitress and informed it was sushi only (no cut rolls or cooked items). I was okay with this, sat down, and was presented with a hot towel. After ordering my fish, was blown away by the quality! Highly recommend you try out this spot. A must-eat for any true sushi lover.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The best sushi in LA I don't care what Michelin or anyone else says.

No frills kind of place. No crazy rolls or tempura or anything other than omakase nigiri.

Just the best and freshest fish each day from the market.

Trust the chef. He will not disappoint.<//text>

AWESOME. AWESOME. AWESOME. I have been to so many sushi places and this by far, is the best one so far, in terms of freshness and quality of fish. The concentration is on the quality of the fish, not covered up with so many sauces and masking flavors. They serve the food simply and it honestly is just so wonderful. The serving size is just right for the perfect bite. Did not care for the sweet shrimp, but everything else was perfect. Great place for simple, flavorful, fresh fish. Nothing fancy, just quality.<//text>

< Review>
The experience and tasty fresh sushi deserves 5 stars, not to mention the attention and service we received. The high priced bill was worth every penny. I couldn't help but compare how all the travel shows we watched when they would visit a true sushi chef in Japan who would just serve whatever fresh fish he had, was such a similar experience. The difference was, of course, not being in Japan and eating all local native fish and other creatures from their waters, but we still were able to try fish imported from places like Spain, Canada, Scotland, and our neighboring Santa Barbara. It was awesome sharing this special experience with the love of my life who was just as open minded trying everything the chef put in front of us!</Review>

Possibly the best sushi I have ever had. Incredible flavor and texture in all the fish. Strictly traditional nigiri and a few hand rolls... Definitely for experienced sushi consumers, but excellent.</Text>

The omakase experience at this restaurant is simply sub par for the price point.

The chef is very friendly when you start talking to him but he and his staff are very pretentious about his art, and undeservingly so. This sushi restaurant simply doesn't even come close to omakase from master sushi chefs in Seattle or Boston yet he is charging prices which significantly surpass any omakase with a master sushi chef in those other cities.

What's wrong here?
1st: Temperature. I had a mix of refrigerator cold albacore sushi with sauce, to nearly frozen crab and shrimp in a citrus based sauce, to warm, almost hot, rice in a nigiri with room temperature (and very tasty) tuna.
2nd: Flavor balance. Aside from the flavor and texture issues that come from the improper temperature, not a single dish I had left me with a complex favor of different kinds of umami. All dishes were extremely basic, utilizing the sweet flavor from the fish, salt from soy sauce or sour from citrus and vinegar. Nothing truly came together for an amazing treat for your taste buds (except the tuna). On top of that, for my last sushi I received a very spicy tuna roll that completely burned out my pallet, ruining all of the delicate sweet flavors I had in other dishes. I felt like I was assaulted with spice all of a sudden because he wanted me to stop eating (which I already said I was on my last bite so why do that?) And for scale, my typical maximum amount for eating sushi is an 8 piece nigiri or 1 specialty maki
3rd: Price. A sushi chef who can't get temperature and flavor balance right has no business being this expensive and pretentious.

What's right here?
1st: Quality. The chef knows how to find, select, and prepare top quality seafood and I do think that is valuable
2nd: Service. While most of my interactions with the staff were rather terse, I understand they have a lot of rude folks who come by who don't understand omakase so I was okay with a little bit of uneasiness there. I received a hot towel immediately after sitting, all of my dishes were promptly cleared away and my drink was refilled immediately. Fantastic service

The thing that really makes me sad to write this review is that he is a very good sushi chef and overall the sushi was very good, definitely above average. I would have been happy with a charge of about 70-75% of what I was charged because that is the value of the experience I had. Unfortunately, I definitely can not return because I refuse to pay $145 (for just myself) again for a slightly above average omakase (average across multiple cities across the US, not just LA).<//review>

<Text>So good. So absolutely good! Yet again, another amazing sushi place tucked into the corner of an unassuming strip mall! This incredible restaurant serves amazing fresh sushi that is delicious every time, all the time! The staff are hugely helpful, and offer suggestions when asked. Sake selection is good, and that melt in your mouth sushi you've been looking for? It's here.

Pro tip - parking in the little lot can be tough, but there is ample street parking.</Text>< Pictures>

I love the authenticity of this place no California rolls which was blessings to my ears. I didn't like that the chef had to "chose" you to sit in front of him like he's some sort of sashimi god. I came in there alone and was forced in a both. I also came an hour before closing and my server barely paid attention to me and there was only ONE other part. Sushi was GREAT kinda thin but fresh great tasting service was kind of bad definitely needs some improvement. I spent $90 by myself but what can I say I love SUSHI!! Come here with your pocket deep and your taste buds ready!!</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

It's a culinary experience.  Omakase is the way to go.  Still one of the best sushi I ever had.< /review>

<text>Holy smokes, I came here looking for a reasonable lunch special under $50 and ended up spending $125 after tips and tax for an average omakase:
2x tuna sashimi
2x hamachi toro
2x aji
4x small cubes of dungeness crab
3x tai sashimi
2x aji
1x small baked cod
2x uni
2x toro
It's a good amount of food with some nice albeit small pieces but definitely not worth the hefty price. If you must come here, I suggest going ala carte to avoid the sticker shock.</text>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Came here after some friends were raving about the place for my birthday dinner and I wasn't disappointed. While it wasn't the best omakase I've had it was very good. The fish quality and freshness was superb. The price was not bad either, it came out to around $160ish for ny girlfriend and I together, although she got full before I did and I had 3 or 4 more plates than she did. The cheif is very nice and friendly as was the waiter (we didn't sit at the bar). I loved that it was a small restaurant, no wait and not crowded and was able to get some high quality sushi. I'll definitely come back again.< /Review>< Pics>

Excellent, high quality sushi.  Omakase (chef's choice) is the way to go, but be prepared to pay for the quality.< /review>

<time>1564631053648<//time><rating>5</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant which is not known yet. The sauce mixed with fresh seafood was completely different from the usual sushi. The taste is neat and not at all stimulating. You can enjoy it even if you do not like the irritating taste of the wasabi. However, despite the fresh and pleasant experience, expensive prices, small quantities, and few tables were a little disappointing. Have fun and delicious meals :)
However, there seems to be a regular pattern in the area. The guests were very loud. So I have not noticed and enjoyed.

아직 많이 알려지지않은 맛집입니다. 신선한 해산물과 적당히 어우러진 소스는 평소먹던 스시와는 전혀달랐습니다. 맛은 깔끔하고 전혀 자극적이지 않습니다. 와사비의 연한부분만 나와 자극적인 맛을 싫어하셔도 즐길 수 있습니다. 다만, 신선하고 즐거운 경험임에도 불구하고, 비싼 가격과 적은 양, 그리고 적은 테이블은 조금 아쉬웠습니다. 즐겁고 맛있는 식사되세요 :)
단, 지역에 단골이 제법 있는 것 같습니다. 손님들이 엄청 시끄러웠어요. 그래서 눈치안보고 즐기다 왔습니다.<//Text>< pictures>

Ramon and Eduardo are the best. Walking into the Inglewood site feels like your entering one of your favorite friends home. Those two Gentlemen are the two I worked with. The entire sales personnel were outstanding and very friendly, they also made sure safety comes first.👍up to the Inglewood family.I wasn't forced or harassed by anyone.This is not my first go around with the Inglewood office it's my 2nd and there's some different people and changes,but the best thing that haven't changed is dealing with friendly people, funny people, understanding people, nice and respectful people. This office is my friendly family business. 👪love them they keep you smiling at all times.
SO SORRY VROOM CAR GURU ETC. I LIKE DOING MY BUSINESS OLDSCHOOL.I like to know who I'm dealing with..also office is very clean all over.
When your handling business and your glucose starts to drop or you have to check your blood pressure and your sales manager goes into his pocket to make sure you dnt pass out and give you time out of there time to check your BP(blood pressure)it's a blessing and that's with them not knowing if your going to buy or not.
👍👍👍👍Ramon and Eduardo appreciate people like you. Inglewood office will always be the best. Better than the corporate and El Monte offices those are the other 2 that I have dealt with.
God Bless to you guys
He has blessed me with both you. If the Inglewood office ever closes that would be my last time dealing your company.

Alfredo Orozco was above and beyond helpful, he made sure I was comfortable and happy with my decisions.
Made available many extra resources I other wise would not have brought up to attention.
Giving plenty information and making sure the process was simple and easy.
I would recommend anyone having second thoughts about buying a new car to come by and see the many options.< /review>

If you are going to finance a car and you do not have social security or itin number, this is a good place, but it is also a dealer that has very high car prices and a lot of interest, I got a car valued at 6,000 dollars less than the price I got and  I am not satisfied with the car, I really would not recommend this dealer and I think I will return my car no matter what happens, with the money that I pay at this dealer almost 500 dollars a month for a car from 2016 with that money I could have a better  car, find out very well if you want to buy here, I think they talk to you a lot and confuse you.<//Review>

Worst Place for a car dealer. I bought a car and 2 months later I had to spend $1600 to fix it. Then they do not report your credit to all 3 Credit bureau. There also picky about what kind of insurance you get.  Most ridiculous dealer ever. As well they didn’t report 2 payments and my credit dropped 32 point. When I have had perfect payments

Never recommending this dealer!!!</text>

Not only is this place over priced but their cars are damaged asf, their mechanic is even worst, he put a hole thru our oil filter had to get that fixed, and that was a week within purchasing the car, they send me letters with different people name along with mines, they tell you you can return the car within a month but that's all bogus, their interest rates are ridiculous !

HORRIBLE PLACE TO BUY A CAR! BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! When u have a problem with your car they DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARS they send u different numbers/people to call and its still pointless! They also get u by having to pay TWICE A MONTH telling you "it will build your credit up fast" BS use that "TWICE" a month payment elsewhere and pay half of that in a month and STILL GET UR CREDIT UP FASTER theyre cars are overpriced! N all messed up! Just wait for a few months not even a year to find out< /Text>

(Translated by Google) You win car "TRANSEANDO" to the community!
I had a very BAD experience
And they told me that I couldn't return the car. That's a lie. I got a lawyer. If he helped me, the secret is not to stop paying, because then the Unicoi who could help me are called against you.
CONSUMER ACTION LAW GRUP
They can help you return the car and get all your money back!

<Text>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend doing business with this dealer. I paid for more than two years for my car without falling behind on payments in the hope of making the long-awaited credit in this country and they did not comply, in the internal application of the dealer they wrote my social security but In the database it was only filled with 11111111 when I called sperian to ask there was no report of desire to my name. A total fraud and that is because they sell you an overpriced used car with reference to the blue book and when you realize you try to return it they threaten that your credit will be ruined ... !!! If this is the case of someone else, check the credit first, if there is no report, return it immediately, it does not affect them at all.

No recomiendo hacer negocios con este dealer.. pague durante más de dos años mi carro sin atrazarme en los pagos  con la esperanza de hacer el tan soñado crédito en este país y ellos no cumplieron, en la aplicación interna del concesionario escribieron mi seguro social pero en la base de datos aparecía relleno solo con 11111111 cuando llamé a sperian para preguntar no había ningún reporte de ganas a mi nombre. Un fraude total y eso es porque te venden un carro usado sobre  valorado con referencia al libro azul y cuando te das cuenta lo tratas de devolver te amenazan que se te va a arruinar el crédito... !!!

(Translated by Google) Do not waste time and money! This company is loans, with a high price, with fortnightly payments. For example, a vehicle valued at 18,000, wanted 27,000, with payments of 614.00 per month for 48 months, a total of 34,000! That is why they do not announce the price, or payments, or interest, in their advertising! A total robbery! 😱 Very nice latin people, the positive! Thank you! 🤔😟😟

And then they stopped the troka for 1 month because it was going to end the year of the guarantee ...

(Translated by Google) Watch out !!!!!!!!!!!!
It is one of the worst experiences that the very friendly and very attentive saleswoman has given me, but after two other people helped her to assist me, they assured me that the car was inspected at 150 inspection points, which is a fraud 10 hours after the car was no longer I turned on it did not start the second day that I found more problems I told him that I no longer wanted the car and the manager told me that he could not deliver it I found out online that in California you can return a used car within 10 days and they do not want to live the car Oliver the manager told me that I am not a mechanic and that I can not assure that the car has a problem although it does not start and they are sending me to a mechanic on a date that has already passed 10 days so I will no longer be able to return the car now I transport in uber it is very unfair and very low what these people do not be fooled these people say fraud when selling cars in poor condition well that is just my experience maybe it is just me but have cu ripped

Cuidado !!!!!!!!!!!!
Es una de las peores experiensias que me an pasado la vendedora muy amable y muy atenta pero despues otras dos personas le ayudaron a atenderme me aseguraron que el auto estaba inspeccionado en 150 puntos de inspeccion lo cual es un fraude 10 horas despues el carro ya no prendi no encendia al segundo dia que encontre mas problemas le dije que ya no queria el carro y el manager me dijo que no podia entregarlo me entere por internet que en california puedes regresar un auto usadodo antes  de 10 dias y ellos no quieren resivir el auto me dise oliver el manager que yo no soy mecanico y que yo no puedo asegurar que el carro tiene problema aunque no enciende y me estan mandando a un mecanico en una fecha que ya pasan los 10 dias de esa manera ya no boy a poder regresar el auto ahora me tranporto en uber es muy injusto y muy bajo lo que esta gente ase no se dejen enganar esta gente ase fraude al vender los carros en mal estado bueno eso es solo mi experiensia talvez solo sea yo pero tengan cuidado< /review>

I had the boy choy Beef which was really good. But, my only issue was it was too oily and salty.  other than that it was great.
Suggestion: use less salt and oil, the salt was very over powering.< /review>

< review>
I have gone to Chopsticks Express so many times over the years that I'm surprised I've never written a review. We probably get food here once a month if not more often. And, even though the ownership changed over the last year or two, it still has the same good taste and decent quality that you would hope for from a takeout restaurant.

I usually get the same dishes from any Chinese restaurant that I go to: kung pao chicken, sesame chicken, green bean chicken, and mixed vegetables with chicken. They're pretty darn tasty here and I've shown them in my images.

Now an FYI: it's not going to be the same type of quality food that you would get if spending $15 or $20 per plate at a fine dining restaurant, but for the price and for being take out, it's excellent.

Not only that, but the wait time is not that long, you can call in ahead of time, and the service is friendly and always professional.

One thing that I also like about this restaurant, is that you can order HAMBURGERS! They're even better than or at least on par with Habit Burger, and In-N-Out.

I'll definitely be coming back. I have been for years!</review>

<pics>None<//pics><text>This place is strictly for take out. Real small unassuming. You'd pass it up not even thinking about it. I went there on a whim. My usual spot made a bad meal and now my wife hates it so I came to chopstick express to give it a try. Now chopstick Express is my new spot. Everything was really incredible. Perfect in fact. My children were humming doing the happy dance while eating. I was doing the same. Of exceptional note are the salt and pepper pork chops, bok choy shrimp and the fried rice. Honestly nothing disappointed me except for the fact that it took so long for me to give this place a try.<//text>< Response>

Best Egg Foo Young in Sacramento County....I love the food here and honestly haven't found a place that can compete with Chopsticks in California. I've been going here religiously for 5 years and never had an issue with my order. The food is consistent, perfectly portioned and always prepared on time when you call ahead.<//Review>

The best hole in the wall Chinese food! They're usually pretty busy so give them around 20 min to make your food. Worth it though</review>

I love this spot and have been coming here for years. Combo A is my go to and yes you can substitute the meat with another choice. CALL AHEAD ! Best way to save time since they can get really busy. Great food, quick, and always super friendly.</Review>

Inexpensive chinese food to go...but they also have hamburgers and fries on the menu (which I've been told are delicious).  This place is TAKE OUT ONLY and its right next to Baskin Robins.  You can make a pitstop while you wait.  You can modify your order (like no ginger or onions in the chow mein)...just ask.  The staff is nice and you can phone in your order in advance.  It's one of my go to places if I get a craving.  Just know they're not an open late kind of place.</Text>

The name.just doesnt cover it.  This is one of our go to places for Take Out. The expected fare of chineae food is great, but the surprise is the cheeseburger and fries.  I would put these up against any other burger and the cost is very reasonable.</review>

Call your order in advance so you won't have to wait in the tiny waiting area.  When I get an itch for hearty Chinese food, I call these guys in advance, drive over and get my drink at the nearby Grocery Outlet.  By the time I get my drink, my lunch order is ready.  All my single lunch orders are ready in 10 - 15 min.  I like their curry beef over rice; it's not on the menu, but they had no problem making it for me.  They also make cheeseburgers and fries, which was surprising to see in a Chinese take out joint.  They're ok burgers, maybe a little overcooked, but they come through in a pinch.  My recommendations from them: broccoli & beef over rice, basil chicken, and soy sauce chow mein with shrimp. Good portions too!< /review>

Wow AME has awesome customer service. My husband had to take a last minute flight and needed a rapid test. I called ahead and had it scheduled. Realized it was scheduled at the wrong location(LB), the amazing staff I spoke with (sorry I forgot her name) told me it was no problem and she called the location I needed and added him to that list, we paid over the phone got there in the parking lot had test done and results quick. We spent probably 20mins total there. Such fast and awesome service. Would definitely go back if needed!!</text>

Really nice and professional urgent care. I had a question with a bill that I received and luckily Blanca from the billing department answer.  Very professional lady. I really like her attitude towards answering the phone call. She help me with a bill that I received. She Explain to me step by step why I had a deductible? I really didn’t know anything about insurances but now I have more knowledge. Thank You Blanca for been so patient with me. I really really appreciate it.<//Text>

Any other time I'd give AME urgent care 5 stars, but the service received by today's PA (said her name is Elizabeth) wasn't that great. It seemed like she was grossed out by me. I went in for left ear pain and also because I feel some pain/discomfort on the left side of my throat. She checked my ears, tried checking my throat, but said she couldn't see it. Instead of asking me to sit down, lean forward or back so that she can check me, she asked if this type of issue is something I often experience. Told her the throat yes, not the ear pain. She said both of those things go hand in hand. She said she would prescribe amoxicillin and that was it. If I didn't feel better in 3 days to see my primary physician and she left the room. The rest of the staff was nice, as usual, and I appreciate that, but this PA... Wow... Just didn't seem to care. If it wasn't for the good service I normally receive here I would have rated this office lower, but they don't deserve it for this one person.< /text>

The only issue I have is with calling into the Downey location. Sometimes they don't answer their phone; so I have to keep calling until someone answers. Other than that, the staff and doctors are courteous and professional.<//Review>

<review>It seems like most medical assistants have an attitude, guess it goes with the field of work, who knows. I had a incident with one of them, we rubbed each other the wrong way, but the thing that got me is the young girl walked out takking loud enough for me to hear her complain how i lightly touched her arm. Its clear none of them like me and Im good with that, cause i dont stand for these young girls and their attitudes! These girls are too much.   Hahaha But hey the quickness is great, cant complain! Got what i needed. Thanks!< /review>< pics>

<Text>I used the virtual doctor appointment and was completely satisfied. It was simple to use, and I didn’t have to wait very long. Definitely much less hectic than having to go in the office with everything going on in the world right now. Sometimes the connection was a little slow and slightly froze at one point, but other than that, it was great. The staff member that I talked to on the phone to make the virtual appointment was very nice and helpful.<//Text><user_name>Ceara Lee Taylor<//user_name>< Pictures>

AME Urgent Care was open and available to give me quality health care when I was suffering from back pain. I was able to get an XRay and a urine test and be seen by a doctor for my back pain. The staff is very professional and friendly. I highly recommend this urgent care.<//Text>

Good people, good location (drive from the south, so you can get in), but long waits sometimes. Still, it's good to have an UC that's open during the day.< /Review>

I took my daughter with a 101F fever. When we arrived the nurses without check my daughter they put that she has 97F. So when we see the doctor she told me you daughter is fine I see in my notes that she has 97F. When I asked to double check she has over 101F. Totally irresponsible and unacceptable. They need to be more professional</review>

<text>I came here on a Sunday afternoon. They were very helpful, very friendly, and saw me quickly. All of the staff were knowledgeable and answered my questions quickly. I definitely recommend this urgent care. I took the bus from Long Beach to get there and I was happy enough with the service that I’ll do that even on weekdays when there are other facilities open that are closer to me.<//text>< pics>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Today 01/04/2020 i went to this location to brkng my daughter for a ear pain. We wait 1.5 hours in the lobby and just because I went to the front office to ask about our turn the lady notice she skip us from to many people...
Then we saw the doctor a PA right away and she send the prescription to a CVS pharmacy. A medicine that is not covered by my insurance so the pharmacy and even I call to see if the doctor can change the medicine and they refuse to do it. They told me is no way to do it. I was desperate because my 5 yr old was on pain so I called the insurance and they told me to bring her to a different urgent care or even a ER and they give me a name for a medicine that is cover by. So I do not know if the PA is not acknowledge n what she does but this is an awful experience and of course i will not touch that place again.<//Text>< Name>

I have had mixed experiences here. Many of the nurses and staff are fairly nice and friendly, as well as some of the doctors who I've encountered with.  However, I had one bad encounter with a Nurse practitioner by the name of Marcus Allan Mercado. He was very rude and condescending to me and my mother, who accompanied me on my visit. Usually when I go to the doctor my blood pressure tends to shoot up because I get nervous, and he seemed pretty upset about it. One of the first things he asked me was "What's your problem?" and when I told him about my anxiousness, he rolled his eyes at me.  I didn't appreciate that, This isn't some party trick I like to do for doctors. He tried offering medications, some of which I've taken before with side-effects, but he still tried to force them on me, saying, "Are you sure they were the drugs and maybe not you?" I try to avoid Marcus Allan Mercardo whenever I come to AME in Downey.</text>

Dr Nikki needs to learn how to be compassionate and not invalidate someone's symptoms and claim the 2 year old feeling sick is wrong. Also wouldn't hurt to VERBALLY SAY YOU CAN LEAVE AND NOT W"SENT YOUR ANTIBIOTICS TO THE PHARMACY "AND JUST WALK OUT. I stayed 20 minutes longer than I needed to because she thought that was a goodbye. Also doesn't hurt to INTRODUCE YOURSELF WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM. AND NOT ASK WHAT'S WRONG. Unprofessional and the dirty chairs in the rooms didnt make me feel any better.<//Review>

Mercado, FNP-C ... Was directed here last minute as my urgent care was under construction .. Worst experience!  Arrived with high blood pressure. The receptionist was so unfriendly & the rooms were dirty the chairs were filthy. The nurses that attended were nice BUT the physician that attended me made jokes about my symptoms, not hearing me out. He had no name tag sat there on chair slump back & started talking over me making assumptions.  I do not recommend this Urgent Care to anyone.</Review>

<review>This place had me waiting for atleast an hour before putting me in a exam room for another hour I had to lie and say my son caught the kitchen trash can on fire so I could be seen by a doctor and leave. They were closing up emptying the trash etc to leave and the "doctors" were just chatting it up kicking it. It seemed like I was bothering them. So I basically diagnosed myself but need the "doctor" to order the test to confirm my illness. Only the prescribed meds from them weren't enough. Supposed to be on 3 different antibiotics but they only prescribed 2.<//review>< pics>

If I could leave less than one star I would. This urgent care is horrible. Not only does it share an office with a regular provider (meaning there's no semblance of triage or arrival order) but it is also tiny and badly run. We arrived at 11:30AM, it's now nearly 3PM and we still haven't been seen. It's been an hour since we moved back to a room and when I asked how much longer I was told there were still two more patients ahead of us. This is ridiculous. It would have been faster to go to the ER. I have no intentions of ever coming back here. That is, of course, if I ever get out.</Review>

Unfortunate that this is what most have to deal with for health care.  It's clear they are busier then they can handle,  it's clear they are not staffed to handle any sort of customer service beyond that of 'name,  sign in,  please wait". I am now on the 6th episode of a season of a show and I'm still a few names back on the list according to the clerk. I'm not complaining about the extraordinary long wait,  I'm not complaining about the environment the waiting room is kept in,  I'm not complaining about the 20+ bodies probably making me more sick then I was when I came in... I chose to come here because my doctor in our system can't see me for three weeks... update I was called to make a co-pay and now I wait more...  but why is it that in this room full of sick and needy people of all ages, races and sizes that not one person has felt that they have been given a service. We all know we need to be here,  most of us feel terrible but do we need to cattled and passed along?  What would good customer service or good service be in this environment? What do we expect in a urgent care waiting room? Should the staff be strictly business?<//Review>

<review>When we arrived,  we wanted to drive right back out! The building is in need of remodeling and so is the office, but the service was fast and the staff was very polite, beats being in the ER for 4 hours! Will definitely be going back.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2cda67f409101:0xa9018c32f1111a8b<//Gmap_id>< Name>

I went to this urgent many time today was one the days that really wasnt feeling good, I told the doctor all my symptoms one of them included nausea, After they took my vitals the doctor asked me where my pain was. She informed me that I needed a ultrasound but instead she sent me to get an x-rays without a doubt I followed her instructions but when I went to there radialagy department they told they could do the x-rays. When I went back to the doctor she told me that they couldn't do nothing but prescribe me pills for nausea, and that I had to go to my primary doctor...I was so upset because I still felt sick and and they definitely took my co payment money, but they couldn't help me..so I felt like I could of diagnosed myself.</text>

I have been there with a 103 degree fever. It is a little hole in the wall but they really care about patient. Fast service and DR. Bell , one of the greatest doctor I ever met in my life.
Once the nurse checked all my vitals, i waited for Dr. Bell. As soon as he walked in, he knew what exactly was wrong with me. he checked me anyway.
I had strep throat and virus infection. On top of that, I was dehydrated. he gave me few bottles of water to make sure I drink it now.. He gave me a shot and antibiotics.

THANK YOU DR. BELL . YOU SAVE MY LIFE. GOD BLESS YOU.< /review>

<Text>I have been coming to this facility for 2 years now. Provider Tony and Kenia are amazing. I am always able to walk in whenever my pcp isn't available. The staff is always nice. I visited today and Lonnie, Stacy, and Krystal were very helpful. Wait time is less then 30 mins. Office smells clean and is fresh. Would recommend coming here to anyone. Lonnie is always very helpful always goes out of her way to help me out. She was very helpful today. Krystal is always nice and greets me with a smile.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I was sent there from Applecare Urgent Care down the street. They had no doctors at the time. I went here, and waited a bit. I didn't mind since they called in a 2nd doctor to assist with overflow, she was courteous, and kind. They took care of myself and several other patients. If you need an Urgent Care, I recommend this location.<//review>< user_id>

This is not my first time here but this is the only time this bad things happened to us. Me and my husband came at 9:10 in the morning, we were the only patient in the waiting room, no greetings from any of the front desk staff, i overheard they were kind of ordering or talking about cake while the three of them are looking at the computer choosing what one’s favorite while literally in front of us as if were ghost and doesn’t exist,....we tried waiting finally at 9:31 someone ask if we signed in already so i told her nobody offered anything so far not even the sign in sheet. Good thing , the ladies who did our triage or interview were all nice and fast. The african american MD was so awesome  and funny. Maybe a little bit  of customer service orientation is needed coz it really matters if the staff are accomodating and not just ignoring you. A simple “good morning how can we help you matters” instead of just looking at us without any greetings or asking what we came here for....<//Review>

Urgent care centers are freestanding, walk-in medical facilities that provide care on a no-appointment basis and are often open for extended hours, including nights and weekends. Sometimes referred to a “doc in a box,” urgent care centers are a cost-effective alternative to emergency rooms for the treatment of  non-life-threatening medical situations such as cuts, sprains, simple bone fractures, flus and fevers, insect bites, infections, etc. Some centers provide basic laboratory and X-ray services, and most can run diagnostic tests and dispense prescriptions.

These care centers have existed in the United States for more than 30 years, and today there are approximately 8,800 facilities nationwide. They accommodate an average of 342 patients a week.

Centers can be owned by doctors, hospitals or corporations and take in approximately $13 billion in revenue annually. Many urgent care centers are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants, in addition to at least one board-certified physician.< /text>

The staff is always friendly like krystal is always going out of her way to help me going a ove ame beyond her normal duties. And To me the Best Doctor I have ever had is Tony Nguyen M.D is always there even if he is busy he calls me back. This is the greatest Medical Group and I have been to many others and no one even comes close to AME MEDICAL GROUP  DOWNEY CA.

Do not go here

I have recently been dealing with an ingrown toenail on my right foot. It's been really painful to wear shoes which is required at my job. This all started about a month and a half go. My toe seemed to have gained an infection so I reached out to my primary doctor. My primary doctor could not preform the procedure but recommend I go to your urgent care location in Downey on paramount blvd. They notified me since I have an HMO and have Apple care I would be covered which was great news. Upon my first visit I was placed in a room where the door was left open and the front desk girl was making jokes about me. She said " why would you come here for for such a stupid thing like can't you handle it yourself?" Immediately an older nurse yelled at her and said "the door is open and he can hear you talking!" She cake and shut the door and said sorry. This was super inappropriate!!! The doctor came in with a medical assistant I'm guessing and basically looked at my toe didn't even exam it and just prescribed me an antibiotic and said I'll be fine be fine and wearing a shoe would be fine. Two weeks or so go by and I finished the antibiotic and nothing seems to have hanged. By the way they told me that there's only one doctor who can preform this procedure and he only comes one Fridays which is a clear lie because I was seen by two different doctors. The second visit I was clearly limping and in pain. The same front desk girl was there. I was seen by a NEW doctor who basically said he same thing. He said I would be fine and it's not a big deal. He handed my cream that I could buy over he counter. Mind you I am going on vacation to Mexico in August 5th. I plan on swimming in the ocean and pools. He said this would be fine and nothing should happen. After these visits and missing two days of work which cost me $180 each which I do not have to spare which is why I came here in the first place. I noticed no change in my toe. I was wearing sandals to help heal but nothing. The pain got worse and infection stayed. I then sucked it up and went to a podiatrist that was recommended to me by my coworker. Again I had to miss work and miss another $180. I was seen by the doctor who was shocked that I wasnt given the proper care for and proper treatment. He said the procedure had to be preformed in order for me to heal. He removed the side of my nail and had to prescribe me stronger antibiotics due to the infection. This visit cost me $165 which again I don't have to spend. I was told I would be ok imagine if I were to have went it the ocean and caught some kind of horrible infection? How would you guys have felt about that?  Blood infection, flesh eating bacteria a number of things. I am reaching out to see what could be done to correct the horrible situation I have been put through. Sadly I am so much money that it pains me to ever think about coming back to this place. I think I Deserve at least be given some kind of money back for my wasted time. Since your two doctors couldn't treat me and I had seak other help and I was lied to I deserve the cost covered for the procedure I had.<//text>

NEVER RETUNING HERE...Go elsewhere if you value your sanity and your credit.  Very disorganized when it comes to their billing, they'll send you to collects without proper notification.

The care is maybe a 2.5 stars.</Text>

<Review>My first time here, I don't tend to dismiss a place based on negative reviews, I go and experience first hand then give my honest opinion.  Yes the place is small, but very efficient.  I was seen on a Sunday morning, the staff was quick with the paperwork, the place was clean and cool.  I was seen by Dr. Kenia Watkins and she was very friendly, courteous and professionals.  I will defenitely definitely come back here for those non emergency situations that may require attention on a weekend.  THANKS KENIA 😀< /Review>< Pics>

Horrible place never going back . I didn’t have my insurance card and I walking in asked the receptionist that I had the insurance on the other line so they can send over proof of insurance. Girl said she didn’t need it. After waiting over 2 hrs receptionist calls my son name to advice me they don’t except the insurance and I would have to pay out of pocket. So unprofessional , felt taken advantage of the circumstance that my son was ill and needed medical attention. Defiantly calling the state for file a complaint.< /Review>

It really is a lil hole in the wall. I must say in this case u should go by the famous saying " dont judge a book by its cover" the doctor is amazing and put me on antibiotics. I know someone posted about the staff, but i judge the doctor not staff.< /text>

Got there at 2:25 pm and they told us they weren't admitting anyone anymore.
Had an 11 month old baby very high fever.
A Business shouldn't say they close at 3pm when it's really 2 pm cuz that when they stopped taking ppl.
Or they should post this on the website!!
That they stop admitting ppl at 2pm even tho there doors don't close till 3pm.<//text>

This place is the absolute worst! The service provided by the staff here should be used as an office example of How Not to Behave, What Not to Do and How Not to Treat Patients/Customers in any setting. Most of the female staff were twisting and twirling their hair, standing around talking about places they’d much rather be. When I approached them to ask what the wait was one of them responded, with a roll of the eyes “I don’t know, I think like 7 patients”

After waiting for 30min I walked out.</review>

Waiting for 3 hours with breathing problems. You'd think they would have that as a priority. But it doesn't seem like it.< /Review>

I called in ahead and was told no waiting but I assumed at least 30 minutes. I waited in a holding room for almost an hour before I left. No one seemed to care or be concerned that I was in need of medical attention. I am highly offended and DO NOT reccomend this urgent care.</review>

<Text>I would rate them a 0 but i can’t so it’s a 1 from me. Upon entering at 8pm a women told me they are no longer accepting patients. Their lobby was completely empty, they didn’t close until 9pm. I told them I was in pain so they told me to google another place.<//Text>< Pictures>

I walked in there at 2pm they told me the Dr was going to lunch, we came back at 3:30pm and waited, finally they tell you to sign in and I ended up living because it was almost 5pm and they had not called anyone in. I felt bad for the young lady working behind the front desk that has to deal with peoples complain because they are under staff.< /text>

Not a place to go for customer service, but if you know your way around, it's amazing well-stocked. Very decent and affordable fishmonger. Bonus fo the terrific selection of frozen spring roll wrappers.</review>

<Text>Good place to shop for groceries. Prices are reasonable. Think they need more floor staff to answer customers' questions. Need wider ailes to be wheelchair accessible. They have adequate parking and could train cashiers to appear more friendly by smiling a little bit.< /Text>< pictures>

My favorite Asian market in LA county. Every time I come here, I’m getting so much stuff especially the ingredients for food. The prices are at a good value compared to other markets around town, especially the Filipino spices and coconut milk.</Review>

<text>Delicious restaurant! We had the BEST mussels with fries and the clam chowder in the bread bowl. Everything was so good! The view was beautiful as well - could see the pier and the sea lions in the distance. Highly recommend to anyone visiting San Francisco!</text>< pictures>

I went to buy something for my landlord but I found different brand and I asked to the cashier if I could return it in case my landlord wouldn't like it but her response was no and rude, I will never go back to this store again.🤨< /Text>

Meats here are cheaper than 99 Market near by on Pioneer.  The selection is good and it is not as busy.</Text>

<rate>3</rate><text>Bay City Supermarket, it was nice to know ya!

Fresh Catch is, for all intents & purposes, Bay City with a new name.  Same layout, same products, same meat & seafood department.  Oh, wait!  There is one difference!  No saltwater aquarium as you enter.

Before visiting Café 86 next door, I scoped out Fresh Catch to see what they had to offer.  Upon entering, a Thai dessert snack vendor sells various freshly prepared treats.  Desserts like kanom puang & kanom bang-jee.  Next to that, Thai trinkets & decorations are for sale with pricing varying from cheap to expensive.

Located on the right of the market, Azon's has turo-turo (food in warming trays) Filipino food available to purchase as a combo meal.  Azon's used to be located in the suite which will soon house the Neptune's restaurant, on the left of Canaan restaurant, in the same plaza.  A large dining area with a stage can accommodate a large amount of people  I'm assuming people having private events can make reservations here, but seriously, why would anyone want a birthday party in a supermarket?

The middle aisles have various packaged goods, from chips to fish sauce.  The rear of the market has the refrigerators/freezers for food, such as egg rolls & dumplings.  The meat & seafood section carries live fish/seafood, has free fish frying/steaming & seems fresh for the most part.

On the left of the building, more décor & various knickknacks are for sale.  I believe there is watch repair offered, but I'm not for certain.

Parking is in a private lot.  Fresh Catch is the anchor store, located on the right of Luisa & Son's.

Fresh Catch seems to be respectable supermarket.  I have my local favs, like Island Pacific & 99 Ranch, but if I'm visiting Luisa & Son's and/or Café 86, then I'll pop my head in to see what the weekly deals are.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd2da10b6249e5:0xb01c80b4f85feffc</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Before I even went in there resigned myself to having to spend the afternoon there to get phone for my wife and I. After two and a half hours we only got one phone. We ended up ordering her phone from the website so we don't have to deal with them anymore.</Text>< pics>

< Review>
At this store has always been a positive experience for me. I use this store because of the good personal care experience. Been coming here for 4yrs  rep David and Mando were showed experience with phone products. And reassureed me that the change over from sprint to t-mobile would be good for the customer. Great service< /Review>

The wait was terrible. We went in to buy 2 phones. They only had one in stock and the manager after his lunch went to go get us another one from another store and then when he returned it was in the computer incorrectly so couldn't sell it to us. Then we sat around for another hour only to be told that someone's bringing another phone over but we were on our third hour of waiting so we left. Communication was an issue.<//text>

<review>Buyers beware, I purchased 2 phones recently. During the purchase we were informed we would received 2 new tracker devices, that they came free with the phones. I wasn't really sure if we would use them, but stated to the clerk if they were free, we would check them out. Once receiving my first bill, they devices were not free and there was a monthly charge for each device. It took me multiple calls with Sprint to get these off my bill. Lessens learned, review the mile long receipt before leaving and note nothing is free. We even stated back to the clerk helping us that we would only take them if they were free...</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80dd4b36ad7a5c37:0x7ce95172ec3a8c77< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went to sprint to swap phones.  Just phones. After they told me I can go home and do it myself on the computer because their manager was busy "" ( he was sitting in a chair next to the sales rep on the phone with some girl) I mentioned I had swapped phones there before and would like them to do it. After they whispered to eachother a few minutes they hassled me into getting a nother plan and adding this and that. I nicely denied the extra services and left. Turns out a month later my bill went up 15 bucks because they added insurance to my plan without telling me OR asking me. I've been a loyal sprint customer for 4 years and this is how they treat customers??< /Text>< pics>

Amazing deals for cell phones.   The only thing subscribers should know is that talking on the phone and using your wifi can't happen unless you are hooked up to an outside wifi server.   I was not informed of that.   The management proved to be very helpful in my selections so thank you Rudy!< /Text>

I definitely wouldn't have expected it from the asst. Manager (chick with glasses). She continuously gave major attitude with not wanting to answer any questions. But again I'm sure due to lack of training she doesn't know any better. Also, the employee (black dude) next to her was no help at all. Giving him the benefit of a doubt only waisted more time. He also had attitude. I mean seriously I wasnt asking philosophical questions. But overall avoid this place whatsoever.<//review>< gmapID>

Horrible. The customer service (Mr. Rubicalva, Manager) I received at that store did not reflect  the Sprint high quality that I am accustomed to. Very poor.</Review>

I love Firehouse and I think they are way better then Subway. I just wish that they would Toast the buns too. Maybe they do actually? I'll have to ask next time. Last time I went I think the owner was there or the manager because he said hi to me and bye to me when I went. I thought that was cool too because a lot of places don't even care anymore. The staff here are always really nice and speedy too. I've never had a bad sandwich ever from this chain and I am definitely coming back again. See you again soon!</review>

< Review>
I did not have a good experience.  My food was cold , and the cashier was very abrupt and rude .. I think her name was Bianca? Petit , skinny, brunette , caucasian.  I asked her if she could fix my order and she was not willing to accommodate .  I was perplexed by her attitude. .

I even consulted with the store manager , and I found him to be cold too.  Brunette hair, glasses, a little chubby. I thought he would try to help me and my family out, but he was very indifferent.

Nevertheless , I will not be returning to this Firehouse Subs location nor recommend it.

Seems like they need to revisit their customer service training 101.< /Review>

Absolutely the worst. Work nights on base, come here every now and then but mostly Mira Mesa location. This location had the phone off the hook the entire night. Ordered online as usual and they would bring to car since I uniform, this location doesn't use the phone. Never coming back again</Review>

Firehouse subs are always tasty!!! I use to go to the Point Loma location, until it closed. I still manage to drive out there before remembering it's a new shop now. lol I tried to go to the location in Chula Vista, but their prices are higher!?! These subs aren't cheap, but they're reasonable.

My only complaint is there was a woman working...she was kind enough!...but she contested/argued things when something went wrong. Instead of just fixing things, it just sounded like blame passing. Example: I heard a man before me tell her that his order was suppose to be to-go. No big deal, right? All that needed to be said was a quick, "oops, sorry! Let me bag it right up", but instead she said she had heard "for here" and mumbled something else about what the man might have said when he placed his order. Whether she might have been correct or not doesn't matter. The end result was the guest did get his order to-go, but left kinda miffed. As for me: I ordered a Hook&Ladder sandwich with a few modifications (no onion/mustard, add pickles). All of that was correct on the sandwich I got, except they forgot the ham! lol No big deal. I just went back and told them. Except that same woman then tried to say I must have gotten the wrong sandwich. ?? Someone else ordered the same mods and same bun (wheat), same size, but specifically only ordered turkey? Now, what are the odds? Haha A mistake is no big deal. Especially because the lovely young girl at the counter was so sweet and apologetic, and the gentleman who originally handed me the sandwich was super friendly, and the sub was still delicious ham or not! There's no reason to make weird excuses! But that won't stop me from coming back for more delicous subs, especially while they're having a $5 sub promo!<//Review>

<Text>We went because we had a coupon. I had chicken bacon ranch and it was okay. My son was very disappointed with the New York Steamer. There was hardly any meat. It was all bun.

<text>Terrible service. First they screwed my order up and luckily I'm not allergic to anything they put in the sandwich. Then we called and they said its because they have new people and they guess they just didn't care. And on top of that, the sandwich was ice cold when it shouldve been hot. 10/10 WOULD NOT recommend!< /text>< time>

A friend of mine recently went to this restaurant and came out and told me that the girl who made his sandwich was not wearing a mask or gloves. I guess the pandemic doesn't apply to them. Im glad I didnt eat there.<//Review>

<review>Today Nov, 7 2019 about 11:30 am. Went in to get a sub. People are friendly but waited it 30 minutes for the sub after my order was placed and ask the employee find out how much longer and she told me takes 10 more minutes. Then finally they have my sub make. it It looks like they have to go hunt a Turkey first to make the sub. I will not buy again in this establishment.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Excellent food and friendly service. Recommended combo is the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket with the chain's unique Cherry Lime-Aid. Also offers rewards points for users of the app. Prices scale a good bit with bigger sizes, but you get a lot on your sandwiches.< /text>

I love Firehouse Subs, and I've been eating them since I was on the east coast.  To me, the serve the perfect sandwich.  The bread is toasted to a nice crisp, the meats are flavorful and juicy, and the flavors are well-balanced, not too salty or sweet.

Among my favorite sandwiches include the Hook and Ladder--the honey ham is simply delicious and adds a savory sweetness to the sandwich that makes it very well balanced, the New York Steamer--probably the best corned beef and pastrami I've had outside of NYC, the Meatball sub, and the brisket sandwich, which has a nice smoky flavor to the brisket slices.  (My friend and I used to often joke it's smokier than most other BBQ joints in San Diego!)  In addition to the sandwiches, the cookies are great.

For any regional or national franchise, Firehouse Subs is definitely my go-to for sandwiches.<//Review>

The majority of the time I get the brisket.  I have always enjoyed this sandwich at Firehouse Subs.  This location had the worst brisket sandwich I've ever had.  Dry, bread tasted stale.  I would have said something hadni not taken the sandwich to go.  The only reason for 2 stars is the friendliness of the staff.<//Review>

I have no idea how they have this rating. I literally get tomatos, pickles, lettuces and cheese and Everytime (4times) I have come in they have found a way to mess it up. They are always very rude especially the "manager" or " owner" her badge changes Everytime too. When I told them they made it incorrect she snapped it from my had and started slamming things behind the counter. I keep trying again and again with same results. Check your orders!< /Review>

Great sandwiches, but what I really loved is when I asked for a cup for water, they actually have me a decent sized cup! Like a medium sized fountain drink, not a rinky dink little cup that I need to refill 4 times.
The parking lot sucks.<//review>

<review>Order placed at 11:38 didn't have a sandwich in my hand until after noon. Almost had to walk out to make it back to work in time. Staff was trying their best, but they were swamped with online or phone orders. Food was good, but I had to eat it for dinner because I had to race back to work.< /review><Date>1547540300821</Date>< name>

<text>Ordered thru Doordash and it arrived ahead of time but the sandwich my husband(a retired firefighter) ordered was put together poorly. The bread was smashed down even tho it was in a box. It was supposed to come with chips, a pickle and a cookie but all it came with was a cookie. Total order was $13.57 with tax and delivery  I will NOT be ordering from them again. It was just sloppy.< /text></record>

Contrary to what I read from someone who had visited previously, I realised that the place is open to personal shipping abroad and finding parking space wasn't difficult at all.

There was no long queue but it a very very very long time before i was attended to. I guess the processing is so daunting. However, I believe it can be improved on and become a lot faster.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.<//Text>

My package is still waiting in sorting facility in Los Angeles by the airport, it’s been 4 days today, they don’t answer phone calls. If you have time to wait 7-8 days extra this company is for you, do not miss it, it’s gonna be fantastic<//Review>

Do not attempt to use this company. They do not uphold their commitment. They have people in place to answer questions that don't have the answers. I was given the run around by everyone that I talked to. I was kept in limbo for days before I knew anything concrete as to where my shipment was and when I would receive it. The worst!!!< /review>

My Package oringinal from Hongkong DHL express and LAX dhl called me claim my package is hold by customs and need provide product invoice and fda # ... I ask shipper to confim the invoice and send to LAX dhl they still can not release my package from customs and ask me to provide fda # how can i normal skin care machine has a FDA # on it？Its oringinally made in china not made in US..
I am so frustrated by using DHL express its not express at all， it takes forever to release my package and sent it back eventually...i even ask dhl to open the box to check the number they wanted on the machine but no help at all...Exteremly Disappointed<//review>

Still waiting on a package that's been sitting in their facility since May 11, 2020. Completely ridiculous. I live 3 hours away from LA but I could have walked and picked it up faster then this. Completely disappointed in this service !!!! Negative 5 stars</Text>

Fake DHL Location!!!
They called me and claimed I have a package sent to Shanghai that has "suspicious item" and is stopped by the Custom. The funniest part is I don't even live in LA!
Have already filed a report for Fake Information on this location. This type of low-IQ fraud is just as amusing as it is embarrassing.< /Text>

<review>My experiences with this company have generally been good overall so I give them 5 stars. Definitely prefer them over UPS or FedEx, who like to BS around, lie and say they "attempted" to deliver your package when clearly they did not. DHL at least tries to contact you. OnTrac is another one that I like since they also contact their recipients and take extra care.

If my experience ever changes, I will change my rating accordingly.</review>< rate>

Worst location to work for i believe DHL is a great company but this location has gotten out of hand in general worst location to earn a living. Management, schedules, under pay, forced over time hours, labor.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Whenever I buy in the United States online, it has to go through this package and the things that I have ordered so far have arrived in very good condition.

I celebrated my graduation today in this delicious restaurant. Well it was a superb evening and the venue was certainly the reason for the strong event. The crew  collaborated in a lovely manner, the cooking was tasty and my guests were so  happy. We shall absolutely return for more events. Thank you very much.</Text>

Very neat and accessible place. They serve large meals and for inexpensive prices. I liked the food very much and the staff were super attentive and explanatory. Will definitely recommend this restaurant.<//Text>

I celebrated my graduation this evening in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a tremendous evening and the restaurant was clearly the reason for the strong celebration. The stuff  participated in a pleasant way, the food was very good and my buddies were very  happy. We shall definitely return for more events. Thank you very much.</Review>

< review>
I have been at this establishment several times! However, it was few years ago, when I used live in the area of Cal Poly Pomona. It is a nice Chinese restaurant. The meals, inside, usually are delicious. There is a good amount of meals to choose from. Furthermore, this place is similar to Panda Express. However, unlike Panda Express, their portions are quite larger. At the same time, the prices are quite fair. So definitely, if anyone is in the area of City of Industry, I would recommend to stop by this restaurant!<//review>

Everything was fine, but Chinese fast food is a greasy mess with no nutritional value. I hated myself after eating this for lunch.<//Text>

It is a great eatery! I have been here several times. It is conveniently located near one of my favorite clubs in Industry. The prices for food are fair, and meals are delicious. So, if anyone is in the area, I would recommend a visit to this establishment!<//review>

I'm very particular about Chinese food, and I just happened to come across this place. This place was super good! The food is great tasting and the staff is extremely friendly. I've tried it multiple times just to make sure it wasn't just a fluke but nope, good every time.< /review>

One of the newer nanobreweries  in the area. Easy to find. Lots of free parking. Wheelchair accessible. 16 beers were on tap on my visit. Love their Beerdless Dragon, Scatheus Stout, and Relentless Red.< /text>

The ladies that work there are very friendly, and it is a very intimate space. It seems to draw a very nice crowd, and it has a great atmosphere. The beer is very good, I especially recommend the Relentess Red and Beardless Dragon. If you live in the nearby area, this is definitely a good place to go.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>New Favorite Microbrewery! Really creative elements - including tropical flavors like mango and dragon fruit, herbs like sage and several types of tea leaves - crafted into more than a dozen seriously tasty and well-balanced craft beers. Bonus for your inner feminist: the brewery is female-owned, including (we were told) the first female brewmaster in the Inland Empire. It's ok to bring your own food and parking is free. We got several samplers and enjoyed everything we tried, as well as the conversation with the other owner, Susan, who was working the tap the night we visited. We'll be back!< /Review>< pics>

Such a lovely brewery! Went here for the first time last night, and tried 5 different pints between me and my friend and we were impressed by all of them. Interesting flavors and well crafted. The owner also has a cute cocker spaniel named Bailey who is super friendly. Definitely will keep coming back.</review>

After a night of axe throwing in Montclair u found this unique microbrewery out of the blue just searching for craft breweries that I haven't gone to yet. What really set it apart for me to try was The fact that it's Master Brewer was a female And that it would add a different flavor or mix to your typical Brewery. And I wasn't wrong, I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful their beers were. It's not your typical Brewery set up with bars and barstools and just beer. It was like being invited into someone's house Tables that sit at and play games if you wanted to they even had a section of vinyl records to look through for purchase. It really took the time to make you feel comfortable and at home while enjoying your favorite pic for the tap.< /Text>

Get ready for a unique beer experience at Dragon’s Tale. I’ve never been a fan of fruity beer until this place. They use real fruit (from actual fruit trees from people’s backyards) and not extracts. No weird aftertaste or excessive sweetness. They also brew beer with tea leaves. They have a menu you won’t find anywhere else and you’ll want to take extra beer to go. I did. It’s a laid back venue with an awesome staff. Their female brewer, Nikki, is constantly changing things up and working on some cool stuff out there. It’s worth the trip if you’re in the LA area. I can’t wait to get back out to the west coast just to visit Dragon’s Tale again. Oh, there was also a cute dog when I went there, too. I enjoyed the [human] locals and the owners very much. Not one annoying patron in there! -and that’s hard to come by in any brewery.<//text>

The bears are great.  At most breweries I like 50% of the beers I try in a flight but here I enjoyed every beer and would reorder a full pint of most of them.  Well worth the trip.  I also love they have a theme and it is all run by women as a refreshing bonus.  Definitely go visit the mothers of dragons at Dragon's Tale Brewery!< /review>

We stopped by for the first time tonight, they have food (burgers and cheesesteaks) and live music on Thursday nights, the burger was great! The musician sounded great and he played many songs we could tap our feet or sing along to. The beer was also excellent, they offer a wide range of different types. We will definitely be back!< /text>

Definitely the best microbrewery in the Pomona valley. The descriptions of the dozen-plus beers on tap are spot on, and every one of the six-beer flight I tried were on point. No sign, so follow the directions carefully!< /review>

Fantastic beers,great stouts and ipas, personal favorite was the evil knight,a mango and black tea ipa, high in alcohol content like a majority of their beers, but not at the expense of taste or price(also like the rest of their beers).also personally enjoyed the seating, most breweries have uncomfortable wooden seats, here you get actual seats.it's like getting drunk in a dentist waiting room, but in the best way.I highly recommend it<//Review>

Very well organised and convenient place. They offer large portions and for inexpensive rates. I enjoyed the food very much and the staff members were super friendly and chatty. I recommend this place.< /Review>

< review>
Tonight was the worst experience I've had at this location. The spicy chicken was delicious,  that is all. The French fries were horrible, stale,old,full of oil, just plain old. The curly fries were no better.  Old and soft,  disgusting. I'm so let down, the actual wait time after paying at the drive thru was 10 minutes, they even asked if I could back up, i was expecting great quality for the $$$$ and time I spent. But no I was very let down tonight.< /review>

He said he would write a note on a calendar they keep for issues and concerns.  A couple of days later spoke with Liz and she refunded my purchase but said no notation was done.  I asked to speak with the manager, Liz went to get the manger but said she was on her lunch and couldn't speak to me.  I called corporate and placed a formal complaint.  Corporate rep. told me someone would reach out to me.  No one never got back to me to address my concern.  Will not be returning to this Jack in the Box.  Will also be advising friends and family to avoid this place.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I like Jack in the Box pretty much but when you give you your order nine times out of 10 the french fries are cold or barely warm cuz they make your French fries and box them up while they're making your food they're sitting there getting cold then they put me back after they make you food I do not deserve some good employees are nice and their shakes are great< /review>

Suzy must really love her work. All staff are over the top cheerful and informed. Food is as expected from this chain. However, I requested a custom burger based on the Butter Jack. Here's where Suzy came in. As I took a seat she appeared tableside to get clarification on my order. She then  walked it back to the kitchen (which is on full display). As I waited, the details of the brand new ground up remodel. The techno-cube architecture works well with the frosted aluminum windows and doors, and serve to blend in with grey and river stone paint, hiteck lighting and you get a clean and bright atmosphere.
Suzy, once again, appears tableside with my sandwich and curly fries. Wow. Burger is so juicy with the xtra garlic butter I requested that I ate it over a paper bag. I don't expect this level of service when they're busy. I just hope the staff can keep the joy going.</Text>

<text>I've been to McDonald's and Jack in the Box within a week, ordered the same menu item "Grilled chicken salad with ranch dressing" at around the same time of day 6-7 pm.
Kudos to McDonald's. Their greens were fresher, different kind too, smaller portion of greens and meat, so cheaper price BUT tasty dressing (Newman's).
Total opposite of today's experience at Jack in the Box. Sorry, Jack!< /text>< Pictures>

Service has been faster lately. The drive-thru makes you park around the front... guessing so the meet the quota.

Overall impressed that they are finally getting everything working like a franchise.< /Review>

<review>Great shakes here. I normally dont do fast food but I was really craving a shake and this place did not disappoint me. I placed my order and quickly received the order I placed as it should be.

I would recommend this spot if you're in the mood for it and a fresh drink or some food. It's not everyday I say this about a fast food joint but I liked the service I was given. Very well done.< /review></record>

All I have to say is the mgr on duty at the time mentioned above is the bomb!
I went yesterday and my order was wrong,  the burgers had no meat in them, just lettuce,  tomatoes etc. So I called and went in today for replacement items (I couldn't go back yesterday). She replaced my WHOLE order, including drinks! Also a FREE shake and FREE iced caramel coffee!
EXCELLENT customer service!!!!< /Text>

This location never gets my order correct. Went thru the drive thru to order 2 Breakfast Jacks and only received one and I didn't get a receipt or the condiments I asked for. I thought maybe the cashier stuffed it in the bag but she didn't. I didn't take the time to fuss about it because I was running behind. I don't frequent Jack In The Box often and if I ever pop into this location again, I will go inside.< /review>

Drive thru employee was giving bad customer service since I pulled up. She was very short with me and would make me repeat myself multiple times. I already knew once I got to the window it would get worse. End of transaction, NO RECEIPT WAS OFFERED, once I asked for it she said the machine was down. I asked for her name because she DID NOT HAVE A BADGE ON to which she said Josslyn. I asked to speak to her manager and she replied with an attitude that she was the lead. I asked why no badge and she said BC SHE DIDNT WANT TO WEAR IT. I talked to another employee who verified SHE LIED AND HER REAL NAME IS JULISSA. SO JULISSA LIED TO ME AND TRIED TO COVER HERSELF UP.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dd317397cc5871:0x4077aa65070b669b< /GmapID>< userid>

I have been eating here for years and even after it was torn down for remodel it remains a great fast food place where your not just  treated like just another ticket or number. The staff at this *Jack in the Box* treat everyone with Professional Kindness and they are always polite and Courtois.</Review>

<text>Always a fave, whether it's because I have the munchies, or because I want to go out to a low-key, casual fast food restaurant with my significant other, or even because I'm just not feeling up to cooking. Breakfast all day?! It's bold, balls-y, and in all truthfulness, BRILLIANT.< /text>< Date>

<Text>First off I would like to say that I have usually had positive experiences here. I left my food in my booth to use the restroom and I came back to find my food gone. The manager threw it in the trash thinking that I had left. I explained that I had food that wasn't even opened yet. They threw away a Meat lovers burrito unopened a chocolate cake half of my chili cheese curly fries and my my chocolate shake. When I told her everything they threw away she gave me my burrito my chili fries and my shake. Itild her to give me my cake and my churros. So she goes to the trash can to see if I was lying. I got offended and told her who throws away all this food? I don't think I will be eating there anymore. She literally shook her head in front of everyone like I was lying even after she looked in the trash. Anyway if you go to this Jack in the box make sure whenever you go to the restroom either finish your food or take it with you to the restroom.<//Text>< Resp>

<text>I really liked this location in particular.. I can honestly say that most places now a days lack any real type of customer service. I do not know if the ppl who are suppose 2 be working &providing that costumer service just do not realise without each&every single customer that comes in is literally the reason 4 them even having a job&even more so,each customer pays their bills literally..IF PPL WOULD REMEMBER THIS VERY TRUE FACT MAYBE THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE ORIENTED. BECAUSE WHAT'S EVEN MORE TRUE IS THAT WITHOUT THE CUSTOMERS COMING IN THERE WOULD BE NO JOB, NO ESTABLISHMENT AT ALL.THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.SO.... With all that said I was INCREDIABLY IMPRESSED W/MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE&EVEN MORE SO W/THE AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE I WAS GIVEN.It was a pleasant surprise 2 actually feel i was valued&important as a customer.DEFIANTLY received an A+++ 4 the awesome Service&food thank you..< /text></record>

So I guess I was dreaming. I ordered a biscuit and chicken breast strips . Same thing.< /Text><user_id>101975956400310413867<//user_id>< pictures>

I drove into the drivethru this morning 12/27/18 at 5:30am. I saw the employees inside as I pulled into the driveway. Funny thing is they all disappeared once I entered the drivethru. I waited at the menu ordering station, I then pulled up at the drivethru window and looked around and didn't see a single individual. Sadly as I proceeded to the exit I looked in my rearview mirror to see the three employees suddenly reappear. This location has permanently lost my business because it's obvious that those employees aren't happy doing their job and I certainly don't want anyone handling my food that isn't happy serving to their customers.< /text>

I was in the drive through to pick up a Postmates order that I was delivering and wanted to order something separately for myself, they would not let me place a second order and since I could not combine with the Postmates order, I could not get my order.  POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//text>

Wanted a root beer but they said it wasn't working, so I took a sprite. It was pure carbonated water with a nasty taste. I guess the sprite wasn't working either. Called, but they won't answer their phone.< /text>

The food was still food. Its Jack inthe Box but the environment was uncomfortable and scary. After swallowing my meal and trying to get out of dodge, I witnessed 3 seperate altercations and a homeless man SHOOTING UP DRUGS in the parking lot!! Like band around his arm putting a needle in his arm. Terrible location, needs police or security.< /review>

Bad customer service, the lady who took my order (drive thru) was not paying attention to what I was ordering. They messed up on my order, the food looked disgusting fries extremely greasy. Food was taken back i let them know that wasn't what I ordered, management was not friendly nor helpful more like my employees are right and the customer is not attitude. First and last that I will be coming here.</review>
