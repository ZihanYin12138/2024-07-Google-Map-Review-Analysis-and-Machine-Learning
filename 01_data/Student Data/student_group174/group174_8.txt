Wow. These guys are great. Made a purchase despite the long drive since it was the best deal I could find anywhere. The distributor made an error that significantly delayed the delivery of my rifle, and they went above and beyond to make up for that. I was not upset, but they did it anyway. Everyone I encountered there was honest, professional, and tolerant of the newbie. Highly recommended.< /review>

Awesome place. Prices are good when compared to other gun shops around our area. Can get busy in there but I've always been asked if I need help. Fast and friendly service.<//Review>

I ended up up buying their best recomendation since the firearm that i really wanted was not CA compliant. Will definitely comeback to purchase my next firearm in near future.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

When I went to Elite to look at hand-guns for the first time, I felt very insecure because of my inexperience and because I am female. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the staff to be kind and welcoming. Gene was very patient with me and was a good teacher. I ended up purchasing a pistol at a great price and have no doubt that it's going to be an awesome first handgun for me. I am so glad I shopped at Elite and look forward to future purchases there. Thanks, Gene and Derek.<//text>

Great place,  great customer service.  I've bought 3 firearms from them now,  2 of them were ordered. They arrived in 3 days or less,  way,  Way faster than any of their competitors. Best prices in the valley too.</text>

<review>These guys are friendly and intelligent. Prices are firm and you cant talk them into throwing in anything into a deal. If you want a deal go to a mom and pop gun store. I was going to buy an AK from these guys but called another store and they offered a buy today price for $200 less.<//review>< Pictures>

The others leaving bad reviews havn't been to this store, they lie, or work for the competition. Of the 5 local gun stores, these guys are by FAR the best store. I have never had a bad experience in this store. Always friendly and super helpful. I have had bad customer service at the the other local stores, and I work Retail, so i know what customer service means. Elite is my go to store and I am a Loyal Customer. These Guys Rock.< /review>

I don't even live in manteca but i will make the drive out there just to give them my business. They have great relationships with their distributers so their prices are FAR lower than any other gun store. Even with bass pro just being a mile down the road, Elite Arms is by far more affordable and incredibly more helpful. Whenever you walk into the store there are always several of knowledgeable employees that are incredibly friendly and more than willing to go the extra mile. They have several guys who specialize in different areas of shooting so if one employee can't answer your question, they'll steer you to one of the other employees who would be more helpful. Ive been to other gun stores around the valley and have been treated rudely when i didn't know as much as they did.  I can not recommend this store enough. I will only do business with them.</Text>< Pictures>

Okay prices, but I would rather pay the extra for some service!! Man who eventually helped us, after another customer told them we were there first, was rude and dismissive, and when I asked to see a different gun moved on to another customer. Their loss.</text>

Wow. These guys are great. Made a purchase despite the long drive since it was the best deal I could find anywhere. The distributor made an error that significantly delayed the delivery of my rifle, and they went above and beyond to make up for that. I was not upset, but they did it anyway. Everyone I encountered there was honest, professional, and tolerant of the newbie. Highly recommended.< /review>

<Text>Friendly staff members and willing to help you out. Took me a while to find the gun that I wanted and not only that, they even showed me options similar to what i want. I ended up up buying their best recomendation since the firearm that i really wanted was not CA compliant. Will definitely comeback to purchase my next firearm in near future.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Walked in and they were busy just like any other gun store these days. But within 10 minutes, a friendly staff member came over and was knowledgeable and ready to help me with my questions. I was able to get everything I needed to build my complete my AR at my budget. Couldn't ask for better friendly service.<//Text>

Professional looking staff (black and red polo w/store logo), and a well cared for sales floor.  AMAZING customer service, and the best prices in the valley.  Don't know why I'd ever go elsewhere.< /Review>

When I went to Elite to look at hand-guns for the first time, I felt very insecure because of my inexperience and because I am female. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the staff to be kind and welcoming. Gene was very patient with me and was a good teacher. I ended up purchasing a pistol at a great price and have no doubt that it's going to be an awesome first handgun for me. I am so glad I shopped at Elite and look forward to future purchases there. Thanks, Gene and Derek.< /review>

These guys are friendly and intelligent. Prices are firm and you cant talk them into throwing in anything into a deal. If you want a deal go to a mom and pop gun store. I was going to buy an AK from these guys but called another store and they offered a buy today price for $200 less.</Review>

The others leaving bad reviews havn't been to this store, they lie, or work for the competition. Of the 5 local gun stores, these guys are by FAR the best store. I have never had a bad experience in this store. Always friendly and super helpful. I have had bad customer service at the the other local stores, and I work Retail, so i know what customer service means. Elite is my go to store and I am a Loyal Customer. These Guys Rock.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Elite arms is by far the best gun store in the valley. I don't even live in manteca but i will make the drive out there just to give them my business. They have great relationships with their distributers so their prices are FAR lower than any other gun store. Even with bass pro just being a mile down the road, Elite Arms is by far more affordable and incredibly more helpful. Whenever you walk into the store there are always several of knowledgeable employees that are incredibly friendly and more than willing to go the extra mile. They have several guys who specialize in different areas of shooting so if one employee can't answer your question, they'll steer you to one of the other employees who would be more helpful. Ive been to other gun stores around the valley and have been treated rudely when i didn't know as much as they did.  I can not recommend this store enough. I will only do business with them.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I used to buy my firearms to this place until someone told me to check out Alquist Firearms in Turlock. Alquist, in general, is 10% to 20% cheaper than Elite Arms and Supply. I don't mind buying from Elite Arms if they could much the price listings of other dealers.</text>

Extremely knowledgeable staff, very friendly and helpful. Only negative is that some accessories were over priced. But that could be due to the market for AR's.<//Review>

<text>Great worship and service times. They have multiple main services spread out from Saturday to Sunday on two campuses directly across that the street from each that they call 'north' and 'south'. They also have video recordings and online giving available if you miss a service. I like how they are really trying to connect to more people using technology.< /text>< Pics>

Amazing church that is full of wonderful people that are all willing to help you get close with God. I had stopped going to church for many years and now I am happy to find a place I consider a home.</Text>

<Date>1580286395756< /Date><rate>4<//rate><Text>I LOVE this church, although if you are a progressive Christian you may have a couple issues as i'll note later.

When i first walked in about 20 years ago i was overwhelmed by the sense of joy. It felt like a community, the people are real and welcoming, and dress is casual. I have been going ever since, about 20 years, with some gaps here and there. For the first several months i was overwhelmed every week by the pouring of the Spirit, and still am quite often. There is a good cultural mix of real people and it is pretty big so a chance to meet a wide spectrum. There are many opportunities for growth and participation including recovery and other classes, lots of foreign and local missions (i went overseas with them several times), and emphasize smaller "life groups" where you can get to know some people better. The worship team is also AWESOME. It is a flourishing, creative community.

There is also a wide spectrum of political beliefs, so most people should be able to find common ground, and the preaching itself is not "political" as the focus is on Jesus.

But if you are a progressive Christian you may want to take note of a couple things:

--As you know conservative beliefs of some may seem harsh and when Facebook first came out i was rather taken aback, but i consider CA my family and returned to worship God/BEing.

--I knew a lot of people there wouldn't support gay marriage but i was disappointed to find out the church had an official position against it (i'm straight). Later i heard thirdhand that a great drummer on the worship team was asked to stop playing with them when she came out as gay. That almost crushed me. I am horrified that the love of Jesus is not considered big enough for her. So i stopped donating $ but i still feel it's my family.

--Lastly their core beliefs (this is common to most churches i'm afraid, as is opposition to gay marriage) include such points as: the "Bible" is infallible or inerrant.
I don't believe concepts such as "perfect" or "inerrant" are even real. Is there a perfect tree or a perfect rock? What does that even mean? Nothing written by flawed people is flawless, inspired by God or not. People can believe whatever they want in life of course, but my issue is if you don't accept this and other certain points, you are then limited in the leadership positions you can hold. But it takes all kinds of people to reach all kinds of people, right?

Overall I've been conflicted and still sometimes look for a church that supports the LGBTQ community for who they are made by God, but i STILL love this church and consider it my family despite its perceived flaws (as God loves me despite mine!). If you accept their core beliefs and don't expect people to wear suits and ties, you will likely love it here.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2c168d2dae673:0x105a12e96764e1c0<//GmapID></record>

< review>
I've attended CA for more than 4 years now.  The moment I was introduced to the church, I felt at home.  The people are down to earth, caring, and real.  I've participated in their recovery courses and it has made a difference in my life... so much so that now I help facilitate one of them.
The church has a nice mixture of both mature and young attendees.  The music is incredible and can draw you in and bring out your emotions, by using their talent and the word of God.  The pastors and staff are there for the people and you can feel it in the way they talk to you and in their message.  Its clearly about God and helping you build your relationship with him.
Its a breath of fresh air, I highly recommend it.< /review>

<review>Revelation 12
1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.
7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.
14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>107357844857748592469< /userid>< Date>

Fine to attend if you're straight and don't care that they offer an embarrassing program called "Taking Back Ground". Otherwise, find a Church that will accept you for who you are, not what this cult wants you to be.  Taking Back Ground is a mentally dangerous program against same sex attraction. Selective morality and acceptance is what these "Churches" offer. Divorce and remarry 50x  (adultery by their own Biblical definition) and you can still do whatever you want ministry wise. These anti-gay programs are opposed by all professional and credible mental health foundations (APA, AMA, WPA,  ASCA, ASHA, etc). They're playing with fire, for zero logical reasons, just to fit their Biblical narrative of what they think is Biblical heterosexual living. These programs don't work and are proven harmful.  Also, you will not be allowed in any type of Ministry if you are okay with being of another sexual orientation you can't change. Accepting yourself for who you are is the only thing you can do and leave this cult.  See hrc dot org for more info on these associations, and avoid these Churches and programs. Too bad I was duped initially by their Music programs and "leaders".  All they do is contribute to depressive thoughts, isolation, and confusion. What's right isn't always popular (all these millions of Church beliefs), what's popular isn't always right.< /review>

Frontdesk  personnel  is very knowledgeable on  directions and names of respected organizations who holds offices on this buildings, but the door to your left once you enter to the building.

This is a great resource for anyone who has a friend or loved one with disabilities. They assist people with disabilities with housing, medical, and other needs for mentally and physically handicapped people. They are fantastic and do a great service not just for the handicapped, but for the family of people with disabilities.</Text>

<Text>I have called several times to speak with a service coordinator about setting up in home services for my intellectually delayed mother.  She is qualified for assistance and has agreed to receive services.  I feel that her step to progress is held back when nobody picks up the phone.  I've even emailed and nobody got back to me.  If there is a turnaround time people actually call back, people should note that in an auto response or voice messaging system.   Or is there a way to take a number?

I've even called the front desk line to try to be transferred to a service coordinator, and they basically forward their calls to voicemail.  I've also asked to speak to the manager of the service coordinators and get forwarded to emails.  It's impossible to get help for my mother here, and it seems that the service coordinators are unresponsive.</Text>< Pictures>

Ugh! Who ever answers the phone can be so rude. I called once had to leave message for got to add a thing. Called back and in a rude voice "you have to leave a message" like okay I forgot to add a detail no need to be rude for receiving a second call so I could finish the message correctly.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1494347926803<//Time><Review>Some staff are sometimes dumbasses.
Case:
They wanted to wash a soiled linen full of human feces in the washer separated from other linen with hot water. Multiple times as needed. And disinfect the unit multiple times as needed.
Problem:
There are 4 other clients that uses the washer plus the people that are live-in care providers.
Common sense. You dont know what kind of remmants of the feces are still in the washer and dryer no matter how much cleaning you have done. Wouldnt be easier to just throw it away and buy new ones.
These people arent the ones that takes the client to hospitals when they get sick. They are actually going to blame you for it. What a joke.
Maybe next time I will save those soiled linen and have it laundered at their own units.< /Review>< gmapID>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Do not trust those people!  They are not there to help people or families with special needs.  They are only there for themselves.  Either their ego or money is driving their decisions as they do not seem to care what is best for the individual.  Nothing I have seen or done with them is about the families or individuals.  They need to be seriously audited by a 3rd party with no affiliation.  The other part is that there is no other option to get services (against the law - MONOPOLY)!

Horribly arrogant people who just expect people to roll over and accept anything they say.< /review></record>

I was thoroughly disappointed. The food was very bland. I asked for a Cali burrito and paid over $13 dollars for the saddest burrito I've had in my entire life. Almost 50 percent of their menu is now absent, including their iconic "Monster Menu". This used to be a go-to, will now not return.<//Text>

< Review>
I had just visited this place within the week and I had experienced terrible customer service from the manager of the place that was working the counter at the time. She told me and a few of my friends that we had no belonging of being there after trying to order our food. She told us that it wasn’t the place for us and told us to leave. If someone asked me if this Los Primos was a good place to eat I would immediately say no and give them the reasons provided. On top of the terrible customer service some of my friends had ordered a California monster burrito and they showed expressions of disappointment and unsatisfactory. There was a max of around maybe 5 pieces of meat. We then wondered why there was such little meat in the burrito and they said they put 8oz of meat. As we saw this was a lie. This then leads me to saying that when we went back to ask them to remake it or give our money back they denied both options. She then told us we needed to contact corporate if we had complaints. Again I would never recommend this place to anyone if they wanted to dine in or take out!!!<//Review>

< Review>
Worst costumer service ever!! Very rude lady working at the counter who is supposedly the manager. She ruined our order, which we then asked to either receive our money back or have them make a new monster burrito and she was denying our requests. We were then told to call the corporation for further complaints or details!! Would recommend to never go to this location.<//Review>

It's typically pretty hard to find a Mexican joint that offers vegetarian items on their menu asides a basic bean burrito. Primos has more than a few veggie wraps and salad bowls, including more vegetables than. Just. Beans!< /text>

Always love the pizza at Primos! Consistent, rich flavors and smiles everytime.  Found one day after a yoga class nearby and have been hooked ever since.   Worth the travel! Highly recommend!< /Review>

Great service and the food it’s crazy good. The amount of food you get for the price was great too. If you like good Salsa with your Mexican food, this place has you covered, and for those that like more than a kick on their food they have habanero salsa (my favorite)<//review>

They serve bad customer service all day long!  Very disappointed compared to the other Primos!  The food is on par with the rest of the Primos, just not the customer service, but they are keeping authentic to the service you receive in Tijuana!<//Review>

<review>This location closes at 10pm. My friend and I arrived at 9:16, and ordered our food to go. My friend asked the young man at the register what ingredients went into a tostada. The young man at the register said he didn't know. Not having been given an answer my friend ordered something else. When our food was ready we asked for some salsa, only to have the young man tell us that they were completely out of all four types of salsas. We drove down the street to my friend's house only to discover that our order was not fully cooked. The staff working clearly did not want to be bothered with our order and made us feel extremely unwelcome. Both my friend and I live in the area but will now be driving out of our way to take our business elsewhere.<//review><gmapID>0x80d945456ee519b5:0xf752f7113bd7976<//gmapID><name>Max Gastelum< /name>< Rating>

<review>I had to write another review about this wack place.  Those who say that this wack place is truly great has NO clue what Mexican food is.  The service sucked.  I should had drove up to the street to to Loma bonita taco shop, waaay better.  That's a real Mexican food.  I'm not mad at the owner for making his money from everyone who goes there.  This place doesn't even deserve the one star but had to give it to them so I can write this.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  I really dont understand how people think the food is great, its obvious they dont eat Mexican food on a norm.  The carne asada tastes like it came out of a can.  Lolitas is waaay better at least they know how to make bomb carne asada fries and cali burritos.  Cotijas taco shop in bonita is bomb too, their normal size burritos are the size of monster burritos and cost way cheaper burros and fries even have better food.  Sorry but not sorry.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

< review>
Ordered the nachos with carne asada. Those were ok. The shrimp burrito was packed with a red sauce that tastes like canned sauce and just a few shrimps. We asked for flautas and they gave us something that looked like chimichangas and the beef inside was tasteless. Absolutely first and last time we buy from this place. Stay away and head to Lolita’s instead. Lolita’s is worth the wait even when busy.</review>

spoke to woman employee, she said she doesn’t know of doordash delivery service, I asked why they’re listed by doordash, she said she doesn’t know but in the same breath she said anyone can call in for pick up, I asked if the owner was in she said no, I asked if there are others there who might know she said no. I’m thinking If doordash is a legal business in spite of the information given by google, unfortunately doordash wants to register first & don’t have a call number to call.</Text>

The serivice here is no longer up to standards. They mess up your orders and the food is lacking its past taste. They do not put effort or quality into there menu or there service. We have gone several times and it has been the same experience every visit. If i were you, i would find another food vender in that town center to eat from.<//Review>

<Review>I found this restaurant by chance, glad I did.  Serves really great Filipino food, we had Sinagong and of course limpia followed by mango ice cream.  The resturaunt is super clean, I even looked at the ceiling fan and it is spotless. Our waitress Ate Jam super service. The owner Ate Baby also came out to great us, wow super friendly and hospitable.< /Review>< rate>

Um, wow. I've never had Filipino before, and this far exceeded my expectations. The chicken adobo was succulent and so flavorful. The adobo fried rice and garlic fried rice were amazing too. Highly recommend especially if you're fresh from SFO.</text>

We always go for the pork sisig, kare kare (with or without tripe) and the lumpia, of course.

Pricing is fair and the food is delicious.<//Text><rating>5</rating>< resp>

Don't patronized this establishment, the lady (receptionist)have no manner, I thinkshe only finish grade 5 in the Philippines, if you have this kind of business you should get a well manner, well spoken person,you gonna loosed a lot of customer just for one bad seed.</Review>

< Review>
Its my 2nd time to this restaurant few weeks ago but my husband and his friends used to come here. You will find very good Filipino foods in Kuya's Asian Cuisine! 😋 The Krispy Pata and Krispy Binagoongan are my favorite! Their halo halo is really good! Staffs are nice and approachable. The Manager/Owner is very nice too, he even assisted us in our order, very nice guy! 💯💯👌
Parking is free. 👍</Review>

I prefer Kuya’s over Isla because they give better service. Isla is often far too busy and crowded for my liking. Kuya’s have friendly staff and commendable portions for the price! I come to Kuya’s at least twice a week.<//Text>

<review>Use to live in San Bruno for almost 30 years, now and then we love to visit The Avenue (San Mateo Ave.) to have a great meal from all varieties restaurant  and one we love to visit is Kuya's Best Sisig Beef.  Last weekend wife ask me if can drive to San Bruno just to buy Beef Sisig, why not so we did. Folsom to San Bruno worth it for us. Very humble owner and staff.< /review>< Pics>

Loooove the halo-halo and Bobo cha-cha. Only had dessert here so far. The staff are very friendly and good service. I would have given 5stars but they need to clean or update their bathroom!!!! Other than that I will be coming back to try their food. My friends recommend this place all the time. Forgot to take pics, oh well next time😁<//Text>

the owner's posture should be different ... the impression I have is that it looks like he thinks he's doing me a favor.

Good tasting Filipino food! The only challenge is parking. They need to put a more visible signage that can be seen from the street. But ... Food is great!😊</text>

The garlic fried rice actually tastes like garlic fried rice and not just grease. The Sisig is always fresh and delicious. The Pancit Bihon is my favorite. It brings back memories for my childhood. Lumpia is crispy and not greasy. This Spam is always cooked perfectly. Other places cut it too thick and don't cook it all the way through.  The service is perfect. The price is right. If you like Filipino food, you can't go wrong. There are a lot of other Filipino restaurants now in the area. This is the one place we go back to every single time. The kids love it.

This a charming restaurant starting with the beautiful art deco exterior (a historic building, I assume).  It offers delicious Filipino food.  I enjoyed the Tocino which included BBQ pork, fried rice, and a sunny-side-up egg.  For dessert I had purple yams with coconut ice cream - what a combo!  Try the traditional lumpia as an appetizer and if you like noodles - pancit.  Parking is free and check out all of San Mateo Ave.  There are a lot of charming shops tucked away just east of El Camino in San Bruno.< /Text>

When I want to get Asian/Filipino food this is the place. I normally take it too go. They also make an awesome Halo-Halo (cold dessert which consists of crushed iced, evaporated milk and various ingredients including, among others, sweetened beans, coconut,  sago, gulaman, pinipig rice, fruit slices, flan, and topped with a scoop of ice cream.</review>

I've been dining here with my family for years.  you can always tell how good a Filipino restaurant is by their tocilog.  Sure it's just a simple dish, but it brings you back home when done right.  The tocino is never too greasy with the egg just right, not to runny!</Text>

Just a heads up that their Bicol Express is actually more like pinakbet cooked in coconut milk.  The vegetables they used are squash, okra, ampalaya, eggplant and string beans.  Not green chili peppers which is what an authentic Bicol Express should be ( ingredients should be green sili, balaw,  coconut milk and hipon or meat) . It was a good ginataang pinakbet but definitely not Bicol Express.< /Review>

The food here is definitely worth trying, brought me back! The atmosphere is cool, having rarely eaten this type of food, I'm not entirely sure what to order... Start with the basics, bbq chicken and some lumpia. Cant go wrong. The menu is a little confusing for first timers.<//text>

Absolutely the best authentic filipino restaurant in the bay area. The crispy pata and palabok are simply to die for. Customer service is also top notch< /review>

<Date>1401299324357</Date><rating>3< /rating><text>I had a craving for pork adobo and I drove out of my way to dine here for lunch. The sparse 1960s style dining room is long and narrow and you feel point you've stepped into an old diner. I opted to get the adobo special with plain rice. They served some sort of chicken soup which wasn't very appetizing by looks or taste and wish they had miki, a coconut chicken noodle soup instead. My pork adobo was good and I wish they had served it with potatoes like my mom does. I also ordered the sago, a silken tofu iced drink, but it also came with grass jelly and beans. It was too sweet and overdressed. (The best Filipino food is when your mom cooks it!)<//text>< pictures>

Great, home made tasting Filipino food. Might be tough to park and the price is a tad bit high, but the meal will always be worth it.< /Text>

The halo halo was probably my favorite part. :)< /Text>< Rate>

If you're looking for authentic Filipino food that is cooked well, this is the place. It'll taste like the work of someone's Filipino grandma, father, mother, uncle or auntie. It's my favorite, my family's favorite, my boyfriend's favorite, and some of my friends' favorite Filipino spot. The kare kare, the nilaga, the sinigang, the lechon kawali, pork sisig, and so much more are on point. And for all you people who like your desserts, the boba cha cha or the halo halo are a nice treat to the end of the meal. Keep in mind that one order is quite big, and it might be best to share it between two people.

I can't really think of anything that I didn't like here. Everything here is so sarap. =)<//text>

<Review>I come here all the time. I got tires and my alignment done by Gus and my car feels smoother than ever. Katherine was also very helpful in making the transaction process very painless and showing all my options for brand new tires. I definitely recommend coming here!< /Review><date>1616803140661< /date>< user_name>

2 thumbs down for customer service. Apparently a Ford explorer tire size is too big and they do not carry that size tire.  Hmmm. I bought the same tire from another location same chain.  In his defense his cell conversation seemed very interesting while helping me.  Find another location. I like Just Tires; just not this store.</Text>

Came here when I noticed my tire was completely flat after stopping for gas. Was on my way to a wedding and was already late. Oscar quickly assessed the problem and said a patch would work. Also gave me the option to purchase a new tire but was honest and said a patch would be fine for the time being. His integrity is what made me decide to purchase the tire. I came all the way from West Covina the next day to buy the tire here only because of Oscar. His staff was top notch and I highly recommend coming to this Just Tire location. Thanks again Oscar!<//Text>

<Text>In at 1150am to fix flat. 4 customers ahead of me. Watched a customer that came after me get his car (red Rouge) up 10 minutes AFTER mine goes up.. looks like alignment check. That car finishes before mine, and guy working on that car also helped on two other cars and still finished alignment check before me. 215pm and I am still here.. WTF?
Didn't even get offered anything for inconvenience (tire rotation would've been nice)
I also feel like if I didn't speak up, it would've taken longer.. after I mentioned how long its been, manager tells one of the guys to start checking my other tires air pressure and shine it up.. to make it appear that they're finally giving me attention?

Edit*
If owner wants to verify, my invoice #: 189464
If response is same as others in other comments, then comment response is probably from a bot.
Respond differently if not.< /Text>< resp>

I really love coming to this place. My mother and I both have the tire rotation and alignment deal for 3 years. We came here a couple of weeks ago and one of the workers cleaned my tires. I don’t think a lot of customers get that kind of service anywhere else.< /Review>

Got a quote over the phone for 4 new tires  , sounded like a good deal.
I drove over to get the tires installed.
The guy tells me that installation, new stem,used tire disposal fees were not included.
That pumped the quote given to another $116.
Not happy, especially since i clearly asked if the price was the total out the door, he had said yes.
I met about half way with the star ratings, i blame myself aswell, i should have asked for a total breakdown of service included.< /review>

< review>
I went to this location to get my oil changed thinking I'd receive quality service and work. Come three weeks later and I get a "Check Engine Oil" light on. I open up my hood to see that my engine is missing the engine cap. Turns out the incompetent employees here forgot to cap my engine and so all the oil spilled out and over the sides all over my car. I now have to buy oil to fill up my engine, buy a new cap, and pay a detailer to clean up the oil that's all over the interior contents of my hood. I am appalled at the worst service I've ever gotten in my life and I'm here to warn all about Just Tires and their unprofessional and poor quality. Never again.</review>

<username>Tiến Dũng Bùi<//username><Review>Very unprofessional workers and staffs. Took over 40mins for an oil change. Prices are not cheap. Would never come back this places
dont know if it would cost me some problem in the near future or not. Too bad.
P/s : i was watching the guys who change the oil since the begin. After he took off all the oil out of my car, he asked me to come over and show me that there were some things licking under the engine and told me that he could not put oil in there because it would leaking out of the tank or someshit. If so he had to let me know before he even took off all the oil otherwise i have to thinks in a bad way. And so my car was running perfectly before i even came to this place. Too much problem for an oil change. People should not come to this place.</Review>< date>

Terrible customer service. Incompetent mechanics.  Had to come back twice to properly get a simple wheel balance.< /Review>

They messed up my rare brakes plus i bring my vehicle back explaining to mechanic they told me he is experienced and they lied to me about everything .they charged me $500 thats bs like really if the mechanic aint experience why they even work their why not just do tires only and not advertise you do all type vehicles and service. I am super upset how they ruin my holiday and cannot go work< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd27c4a84050c3:0x7a65030b084ca17e<//gmap_id></record>

Went in to get a tire for our blown out trailer. Rude customer service left us sitting and waiting until I came up to ask if the tire was finished. Which it was, it had been for 20 min. Will not go back.< /review>

Best Gullah in town! Look no further if you want to get a taste of Central Europe without going there. As genuine as it get and delish! I wish they gave me a straw to finish the sauce 😋

Excellent food and service. We had the sausage plate and the chicken paprikash and both were delicious. The sausages were some of the most flavorful that I've had in the U.S.
The owner was very attentive and accommodating. We'll definitely be back!<//Review>

<Review>Remind us of Budapest. Neither of the two pork goulash dishes was salty. The gnocchi was done al dente so they were great for slurping up the sauces. Not big portions. Apfelstrudel was excellent (not too sweet) with fresh whipped cream and huge. Service was fast and friendly. Cash only.</Review>< user_name>

<Review>Good food, possibly authentic, but I don't know. Reasonable prices. However it was  uncomfortablely loud, which made it difficult to hear my table mates and eventually I couldn't wait to get outside to give my ears a rest. I'd recommend going during off peak hours.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Have been to this place a few times. Nice place with amazing food. Must try their soups and platters.

Lots of options for vegetarians too.

Great German beer !!

Definitely recommend this place.

My friends and I were among the first customers to eat here when they first opened. They have always given first rate service. They may take a little time to get to things when they are busy as they are a small restaurant, but that is part of the intimate setting. It's like going to a friend or relatives house for dinner. They go the extra mile to make sure everything is just right. The menu is a little basic, but what they do they do well. I always look forward to going back.< /Review>

*** In Short ***

Flavorful food that falls a bit short otherwise.

*** In Depth ***

After asking friends for suggestions about places that were similar in style to some Russian cuisine I've enjoyed on previous visits to Seattle, Paprika was one of several suggested to me, and certainly the easiest to get to of the numerous options, with the others being on the other end of the city. So, along I came, with a friend, getting their:

* Paprika Goulash - Great, great flavor overall (mostly from the sauce), but the gnocchi was a bit too doughy and lacking in firmness, while the pork itself was too dry for my tastes (albeit tender).

* Mixed Sausage Plate - A combo plate with the Polish kielbasa, and one other sausage I can't recall: German spice? Hungarian Sweet? I can't imagine I knowingly ordered the last one, but... read on. So, this combo plate had some good flavor going on too, helped along with the aforementioned sauce in place of traditional gravy for the mashed potatoes. Kielbasa is always quite tasty, but the other one I ordered was unexpectedly sweet, and while not bad, is not a particular one of the taste senses I enjoy when eating sausage (thus, the earlier doubt).

So, the food is by no means BAD. But, given the other gastropubs in the city that I've enjoyed far more, I can't really see myself coming back. Three stars normally, but 2.5 for this reason.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - A bit on the smaller side, with tables consisting mostly (or entirely?) of two-tops. While a good majority of them are accessible, some are arranged in such a way that they may be inaccessible if you were sitting back to back with someone else.

Bathroom - Didn't try.<//text>

Great hospitality and service. We went on Saturday lunch -- the restaurant is not full, so able to get a table quickly. We ordered pork goulash and Chicken Paprika -- both are great. The meat was cooked perfectly and just the right amount of spices in the stew. Freshly made bread was a nice addition to the whole thing. Not too many options in the menu -- but whatever is there, they are perfect.< /Text>

I'm a little surprised by the enthusiasm in other reviews.

I had the goulash, and while the sauce was rich and flavorful, the pork itself had clearly been stewed past its time.  I can live with dry pork, especially when a sauce is this rich and thick, but I can't really do the (frozen?) gnocchi they're serving... especially not at $26/entree.

My cousin barely touched her plate of vegan sausage and mashed potatoes.  Yeah, her fault on the vegan sausage thing, but the potatoes were eerily reminiscent of my elementary school cafeteria.  My cousin will eat *any* plate of mashed potatoes... but not these.

I don't get any great joy out of bashing Paprika, but it just wasn't very good, particularly at these prices.  I'm pretty sure they could be doing better..< /Text>

While the location and decor help to keep its unassuming presence, the flavors are anything but that as the name sake shines through each dish.

Solid 4.5 stars for this unassuming place in Mission. We weren't finding anything open on Xmas eve, but yelp showed Paprika had tables available so we took a chance and went. Cosy place, serving some honest to good East European and German fare, with a great beer and wine list (they had wine from Georgia which I couldn't try cos I already got some amazing dark German beer). Got the Paprika goulash, which was some of the best I've had in the states, brother got the Hungarian sweet sausage and the German spice sausage, both of which were excellent. The Apfelstrudel was on point too. Definitely worth a stop especially when the weather was cold and rainy as it was yesterday!</Review>

Very friendly owners serving up their family comfort recipes from various eastern European countries. I'd recommend the paprika goulash. And keep in mind you can order it extra creamy or extra spicy.<//text>

<Review>OK so we were searching for a place to eat (7 of us) and we fell upon Paprika. Our family is Croatian, needless to say it was having dinner at home! The food was top notch, just like Mom used to make. I ain't kidding. The owners were so polite and appreciative of our appetite, again like home. Das boot, if you drink beer is a must.. Go, enjoy.< /Review><Date>1421683562300< /Date><Name>charles musich<//Name><rating>5< /rating>< response>

Great taste, it's just a little different from real goulash (which is our national dish, since we are Hungarians). So it was not what we expected, but it was good!</text>

Last time I was there, they were cash only, though - which is odd for a place where you usually end up spending $40ish for two people, so I don't go there often. But it is very good food.< /Review>< Pics>

A really nice German/Polish/European style place with great sausage-based meals and beer to go with it. I really liked the look of the place, with low key wooden tables and an overall appropriate feel, and could not help but revert to my pre-vegetarian days when looking at the menu. The service was quite fast and the place was fairly quiet, allowing me and my friends to have a good time talking. Definitely recommended.</review>

<review>We stumbled upon this spot, and I'm so happy for it! The space is elegant, but also cozy and inviting. Service was friendly and professional, and we were seated right away.
The food transported me back to my childhood trips to Austria and Bavaria, with a distinct Eastern European touch.
The cheese plate and German spicy sausage were delicious, and a good portion size for starters (ok, the cheese plate might have been a bit large, but can you really ever have too much cheese?).
There is a limited selection for entrees, but we knew that going in, having looked at the menu posted outside. That said, even though the goulash and the paprikash looked the same, they tasted quite distinct, and both delicious!

10/10, do recommend.</review>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>We went on our weekly jaunt out to a new San Francisco restaurant, this week's adventure was Paprika.

Dinner was wonderful The food was great. Service was so friendly. The beers we drank were new to us and fantastic.

We ate and drank:
Weihenstephan: unfiltered hefe
Staropramen Dark: Crisp, light, rich beer
SMALL PLATE - GERMAN SPICY SAUSAGE: the sausage was so good, just the perfect amount of spicy
CHICKEN PAPRIKASH: sweet, savory, delicious
SZEGED GOULASH: my favorite, tangy, sour, rich, and awesome
HOMEMADE APPLE STRUDEL: The dessert was delicious, it did not need the chocolate and strawberry drizzle, and would have been perfect simply served with whipped cream

We'll definitely be back. The food was wonderful and a breath of fresh air on the SF restaurant scene. The prices were just right.</Text>< pictures>

Best Czech food in SF hands down. Get the kielbasa sampler and goulash.< /Review>

Just a pity that the Yanks are interested in dumplings, because goulash with six ..... that would be.
But the owner is a super guy and talks well with him, although only occasionally, because he has to attend to other guests.
For me ..... like in school ..... number one with 🌟

Možná jedno z mála míst, kde český majitel čepuje české pivo a vaří tady středoevropská jídla. Jen škoda, že amíci memají zájrm o knedlíky, protože gulášek se šesti..... to by bylo.
Ale majitel je super chlap a dobře se s ním pokecá, i když jen chvílemi, protože se musí věnovat i ostatním hostům.
Za mě..... jako ve škole..... jednička s 🌟<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7e40b08346d1:0x301a351488a3df99</Gmap_id></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Agnes does an outstanding job every year. She explains our options well is simple, clear and precise language without being simplistic. She is efficient without being cold and distant; instead she smiles and generates warmth and understanding. I think she genuinely wants to help us pay less tax and create more value for ourselves.</text>< name>

<Review>Dianna Hall and Yessenia were so wonderful. They helped me get more than I ever expected. They took the time to explain what they were doing and how to save more money later on. They really were great service providers. I highly recommend this specific store.<//Review><Time>1551801554731<//Time>< Response>

The customer service I got was awsome. Too expensive though. Be more understanding. We work hard to work 3 jobs to live. My mom does it old school style on paper from the library for  free. Not rocket science. However I needed the loan from my tax refund. It helped . Maria was amazing.< /Text>

Yesenia is highly knowledgeable in taxes and she is very helpful explaining things that most of us might do not understand. She really knows her stuff and will try her hardest to get you the maximum refund which is what we all look forward to and makes taxes a lot less stressful.</text>

This Black Angus had been closed for almost a year and we couldn't be happier that is finally open again.  We used a coupon..which can be found online or in your mailbox..had the 18.99 each special..3 types of meat plus 2 sides..added a quality dessert and we had a wonderful night out.  Our server was excellent..she made sure we had bread and our water and of course a box for my leftovers (for a terrific breakfast).  Thanks Black Angus for staying in our community.  I liked Pleasanton and Vallejo but when you only have to travel one mile round trip..it is really enjoyable.Excellent!<//Text>

Our first visit was pretty good other then the hostess she was not very polite. Other then that some of the  food was good. I say that because three of us ordered steak and one of us ordered pasta. The pasta was very good, but the steak??? One out of the three steak was cooked perfectly. The other 2 was not so good. I don't like taking my food back once it's on the table cause I don't know what they will do to it all because of a small complaint. Our second visit ( to give it another chance) the staff was very friendly, but our food??? Yup it was just not good at all. Our steaks were not cooked to our liking so we are never going back again.< /Text>

This was my first time at Black Angus. I will assure you I will be coming back. The service was great! Our waiter was very polite & patient. The food did take just a bit long. It was worth the wait though. The food was outstanding! I love the mashed potatoes. It tasted fresh and to be honest better than KFC and all the other fast food places I have been to. I totally recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!<//Text>

They have the best deals on steak and seafood all of the time of which I love. I waited so long for this particular location to reopen and I left sort of disappointed. Service was great there I must say. I definitely left a tip. Once my steak and lobster came out I could immediately smell the lobster before it even reached the table which often isn’t a good sign. The guy politely took my plate back and offered me an alternative choice of food from the menu of which I am grateful for. I’ve been going to Black Angus for years and that just may be my only bad food experience there to be honest.<//review>

< Review>
This is not my story, as I wasn't there, however my coworker is a great guy who felt that the tables next to him were treated poorly. He was at dinner last night with his wife around 9 pm. He got great service, fast response, and dinner was quick to be served. He was sitting next to three different tables of people. All of them had been there since 7:30 pm and still hadn't received their food, some with smaller children. They received their bread and drink refills, but after 2 hours of waiting, wanted to leave with their meal comped, especially after seeing my coworker sit down, order and get their food before they had received any of their meals. Unacceptable. Did I mention my coworker is white and the tables were filled with African-Americans? Not sure if that played into it or just bad service. I will not go here based on this story. He doesn't write reviews and so I said I would share it for him as he was outraged!< /Review>

Well, unfortunately, 2 Fridays ago when I ate there with a friend, the service was terrible, the wait time was atrocious, I could tell the server was dealing with the bar, and serving station. I guess I chose the wrong day to go. The food was super expensive. A steak and vegetables and a salad for my friend, ice tea 4 me, and a regular  Margarita all came out to $60.00 minus the 20% tip they ask you for. To be perfectly honest, I left $10.00 as a tip. I don't think it was earned. But I felt bad for that lady. Perhaps Black Angus needs more servers, especially on weekends.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Very SLOW Service and when I ordered Mash Potatoes NOT Once did our waitress tell Us they have NO gravy for the mash potatoes, .No bread was served until after our appetizer was finished. Very small portion for the dollar amount, for all 3 meals, that were not cheap. Cold Tea was refilled with no ice, no sugar, no lemon, just poured. And then we got the bill WAY before our dessert came. The Bathrooms Both, can use a good scrubbing and Updated, old piping.. restaurant was empty.. Black Angus needs to be relook at..<//Text>< Pics>

If you like a quick-served steak without spending your entire paycheck this is the place to be. They usually have good promos where you can have an appetizer, steak entree and dessert for two. Everything is served with the right portions. Service is also good.</review>

<Text>Friendly staff, clean place. Only thing is my steak wasn't cooked right. The both times my family and I visited same thing happened. I asked for medium rare and I got well done, both times different kinds of steak and both time they were well done. The lobster on the other hand was very delicious.< /Text>< Pics>

Always good food but I was disappointed that the menu seems to have been changed and the number of items has been reduced as well. Add to that there were a number of mistakes on our order. But it was still a great meal and the happy hour deals are good. The chicken strips are good size, you could make a meal of them.<//Text>

This is a chain restaurant so food quality, menu, ambiance is already established. Pretty good. Service here is absolutely awful. If you're one of the lucky tables great! Too many times I have been one of the unlucky tables in the room wondering why those sat a half hour after me received their food first. You see a lot of hands in the air and looks of disbelief. Waited until this time to review but more than 3 times is no coincidence. This was my last visit.</Review>

From the moment we arrived the STAFF was rude, uncourteous and condescending. Service was below acceptable and had to wait 20 minutes for my check arrive, then when she did not come back after 10 minutes...I took the check up to the reservation area to have them put my credit card through.  Only to be turned away and had to track our waitress to be charged.<//review>

There are plenty of better options in the area. We decided we would visit this place since they had been closed for some time for renovations. Thinking they would have to be better the second time around.

We had to wait 20 mins for a table when it was empty, they got our food order incorrect and over cooked. The only thing the didn't screw up was delivering the check.

My advice to you if you find yourself in this establishment do yourself a favor do a 180 and walk right on out.< /Review>

We made a reservation in advance to watch Alabama vs LSU. They changed the channel so we could watch the game. Service excellent. Food was so well prepared. Waitress worked her ass off.

Not a large draft beer selection but the margaritas were great (Drinks 4/5).  Food was good but not impressive: typical steak (done well) dinner but no special salads or side dishes leaving you to remember the food (Food: 3/5). Waitress seemed to be rushed and didn't take her time to learn the menu.  (Service: 2/5).  Enjoyable but could be better...< /text>

Awesome place. Went on mother's day. Great service. But Men's  bathroom was out of order! But there was a lot of Trees in the back parking lot that helped.</Text>

Not that great. Food here is over priced. Service is okay I suppose. Food is underwhelming. I keep giving this place more chances because it used to be a great place but it fails to meet expectations. The best attribute of this location is the atmosphere. Everything else is just... Eh. Steaks can be hit or miss. Their burgers don't stand up to competitors. And the BBQ is okay. You may be better off going across the freeway to the BBQ place. Although, their wedge salad can be quite good sometimes.< /review>

<Review>Just opened after remodel, expected some upgrades in the building but none to be seen.  Carpets leading up to door are so disgusting.  Then you enter and still the carpets are dirty and stained.  We waited for a table, about 5 minutes.  We were seated in a very far corner and I knew we weren't going to have a good experience.  I was right. Service was horrible, food wasn't much better.   Very disappointed!!</Review>< user_id>

Very expensive for what you get. I got the filet with shrimp.  The steak was only about 3/8 inch thick and about the size of a hamburger patty.  The plate was over $30 itself and I managed to leave still hungry.

Would have expected a little more meat for that, or more like a $19 pricetag.  It was good, though.  I should have taken a picture to post.  Totally agree with the other reviews about the price.

We also got the sriratcha chicken strips.  Those were great.

The bar is nice.< /review>

2/24/19

Once again, I'm blown  away by the great service and good food at BA! I'm so glad they reopened. My boyfriend treated me to a special dinner date night this last week and service was good from the hostess station all the way through the night. Even managers who walked by helped clear dishes and ask how everything was.

We did the campfire meal for 2, starting with the Wagon Wheel appetizer. I had the shrimp for my entree and Fredie had the top sirloin. Both were outstanding (but I liked his better). His medium was on the medium rare side, which I also liked a lot! (And I usually only eat steak very, very rare). We demolished both of our plates and then finished off a 4-berry cobbler (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and ...? I can't remember). It was outstanding too! CAn't wait to go back.

12/24/12 - five stars

This review is based on our recent Happy Hour experience in the bar area of Black Angus - we did not have dinner in the restaurant.

Hubby and I enjoyed spending a Friday together when I recently had a day off from work. We decided to stop for Happy Hour at Black Angus and sat down in the Bulls Eye Bar. Most of the tables we full so we took two seats at the bar in front of the bartender, Ieva.

We ordered the appetizer sampler ($13.50 normally, and $5 off during happy hour), cheesy garlic bread ($3.50), and a couple of margaritas on the rocks. The drinks were really well made. Service was fast (sitting at the bar is usually a good way to get good service).

The cheesy garlic bread was really cheesy but not super greasy. It had a taste we couldn't recognize. Mayo perhaps? Or maybe just a garlic spread.... not sure but it was really good. the outside pieces were crispy and delicious and it was a really good size for sharing.

The appetizer sample came with a shrimp cocktail (which was really only three small shrimp with some cocktail sauce - the sauce was good though!). The potato skins were so crispy on the outside! How do they get the skin like that? Please message me if you know how! The buffalo chicken was really good - not too hot (I like hot but hubby doesn't) and not too saucy. The chicken was tender and juicy on the inside.  The fried zucchini was good too. There was the most of this which wasn't a bad thing since it was good and had it's own dipping sauce - a blend of dill flavors.

Had a great experiene and look forward to coming back again soon!

< Review>
This restaurant reopened for business after a fire. I did not notice any sign of damage at the dining area.
It wasn't too busy in a Sunday evening. My party was seated very quickly.
We had prime rib, filet mignon and New York steak.
The meat was not of high quality yet not chewy. No meat taste and flavor was bland.
I used a promotional coupon and saved about $20.
The staff were friendly but not organized and not yet well trained. Empty dishes were not picked from the table in a timely manner.
Occasional eat out at this place is ok but I can cook up a better steak dinner for less at my house!!
I had much better experience here than Sizzler in Pleasant Hill.< /Review>

<review>THIS FOOD IS A JOKE. We ordered through Doordash lobster tail and steak meal, the lobster tails were supposed to have been 3.5oz each and steak was supposed to be 6oz... well then it got here, Doordash delivered super fast, but omg the food looked like a kiddies meal. We weighed it and it's not even close to 3.5oz or a 6oz steak we called Black Angus and were told well the food shrinks lol. Honey we shrunk the food lol...For the price we paid it's disgustingly crazy.
And who do they blame...Doordash guess Doordash cooks their food for them too.
Will definitely never order from Black Angus ever again! We order a lot from Doordash and this was the first restaurant that we received this kind of sample food.
Don't waist your time, it's really not worth it.
Should have listen to the reviews they were 100% correct, how shameful</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

My family always love to go here. The baby back ribs fall off the bone. It is great for large or groups as they have seating for both.  The bar has TV's setup to watch the game while you have your favorite beverage.<//review>

Table was sticky. They never cleaned it. Service was super slow. Bread came very late. Food was okay. Had to ask multiple times for salt, pepper, napkins, A-1 and they left a dirty linen napkin on the table for the whole meal. We finally at the end pushed it off the table. They brought an ice cream for my birthday but they sang for everyone else and not for me.<//Review>

On 3-27-14 (my B-day), my husband & I went to Black Angus in Pleasant Hill for dinner. The experience we had was the worst ever & we do not plan on coming back. We are very disappointed as we used to dine there all the time. The food was not cooked properly & we had to deal with killing fruit flies threw out our whole meal.</review>

The Ribeye was good, the mashed potatoes were awesome, and the bad was great! Only problem with this Black Angus is that it's an older location. The entrance is sub par and the bathroom was gross< /text>

<text>Appetizers were good and that was about all.  Garden salad left a lot to be desired.  Husband's potato soup was okay.  When they finally brought out the main courses they looked disgusting and skimpy.  I ordered salmon and broccoli with garlic sauce and shaved parmesan and hubby salmon and french fries.  Very small pieces of salmon and two broccoli spears on my plate with no garlic sauce or parmesan and a few crappy looking french fries on hubby's plate.  We did not end up eating the main course and will never, ever go back there again.  Huge disappointment!<//text>< user_id>

SAT in the bar area to watch the game, bartender might as well have been a customer too, finished my beer half way thru my meal and bartender didn't seem to care if I would like another, maybe because he was eating wings at the bar and watching the game too, food was good, hey barkeep...No tip!<//review>

If I could give more than 5 stars I totally would! I was a first time car buyer with not the best credit and got discouraged when I couldn’t get the car I initially wanted... Stan explained to me that I needed a car that I can afford as a college student with a minimum wage job and gave me a reality check that I needed. As I went around the lot I saw nothing I really liked until I saw my dream car that i’ve always wanted in my price range in which Stan first showed me when telling me my options that I can afford. Thank you Stan and staff you are all so welcoming and helpful!</review>

Super happy with the car shopping experience I had here. I didn't feel like I was being rushed into making a purchase and I was able to get the car that I wanted not a car that was lesser than. They have a great selection of cars here I'm sure you'll find the ride of your dreams like I did. So satisfied with my purchase.<//Text>

I am truly amazed at how quick this transaction was, Stanley and his team were very professional, straightforward and did not pressure us at all at any moment.  I always had a thing about "small" dealerships and was really hesitant at the beginning.  We sent our not so candid credit information thru the online application on Wednesday morning and we had a new car at home on Thursday evening.  Highly recommended, will definitely be back!< /text>

The gentleman's name is Alfred Mendoza, from the beginning I noticed a welcoming demeanor, someone who immediately acknowledge my need for a new car. As a new father (baby on the way) I needed to purchase a safe vehicle I can transport my most precious cargo, my family. He was very transparent, detailed with explaining my options. He was extremely patient, I asked a lot of questions. He explained my payment options as well extended warranty for the vehicle, I first wasn't sure about it but after he explained it thoroughly it made sense to add it to my purchase. I wish there was more stars I can use to rate his service. I thank you Mr. Mendoza. Gracias! -Albert The DJ Guy.<//review>

<review>No complaints..........just didn't see what I was looking for in my price range.........market is super high for the buyer.........can almost get a new one after the rebate and incentives for what most of the car's I saw were priced at..........might just go and get a new one on a low down payment lease........i can say that the car's are of good quality..........better than many dealer's I've visited<//review>< UserId.>

I am so happy with my car the  professionalism and kindness were beyond my expectations! I have NEVER bought a car with such ease and honoring everything I was told prior to buying my car- no haggling, it was amazing! I have a bankruptcy and got a beautiful SUV! Thank you!</Text>

Me and my family purchased four vehicles from Auto City. Each time, there is no nonsense, no pressure and no games. They are very helpful when choosing a car and getting financing. There is no price haggling because the prices are extremely fair...and I know how to verify the value of a vehicle. I recently purchased a 2019 Nissan Sentra with all the fixins'. I purchased the car for about $900 less than any other dealership I shopped. Plus, it was in great condition, except for some minor things one would expect a used car to have...but their service department fixed them very quickly and perfectly. My last car I purchased at Auto City was a 2011 Chrysler 200 which had 54000 miles. I am still driving that car in the family and it currently has 218,000 miles. My son bought a Toyota Matrix and drove Uber for 3 years, trading it in with 230,000 miles. Another car bought was a Chevrolet Malibu that was purchased and is driving great with no problems and well over 100,000 miles. All of the cars we purchased had no problem other than an alternator, battery and minor things like that when cars reached over 160,000 miles, and this is to be expected. We never had any major issues with any car, and no problem until many miles later after purchase. My most recent purchase at Auto City took in to consideration that I was self-employed this time. Isaac Duran, the finance manager, did everything in his power to get financing with a lower interest rate, and he did it. All I can say is that if you go anywhere else, you will pay more, put up with weird sales games and miss out on an easy, positive experience in buying a car. And, to boot, they will stand by your car for 6 months, 6,000 miles along side the dealer warranty (they have a huge auto service department to ensure the cars they sell are good). They have always backed us up and made buying a car a positive, easy, confident and a no-risk transaction. Anywhere else I went to check, I always got the "weird-ar" pegging out. Very good, honest people and great cars, with no worries! This is a very positive review, but there is truly nothing I can complain about after buying all of our family cars there for years. Talk to salesperson Mike or Alex...they are both very helpful, friendly and know what they are doing. The sales manager is great and ensures everything goes quick, smooth and I get a good deal.< /Text>

We were dreading buying a new (used) car, but the deal I found online at Auto City was too good to pass up. And to our surprise, it was actually a very easy, painless (even pleasant) experience! There was absolutely no pressure, and we didn’t have to negotiate the price at all because it was already below CarFax. Unlike our dealership experience, they didn’t try to tack on a bunch of extra costs when finalizing all the paperwork, and they were very candid with us about everything. Our sales advisor, Mike Manastryski, was especially great to work with and even drove the vehicle over to our lender to be inspected. 👍🏽👍🏽</review>

Bought an awesome car here and am very satisfied with my purchase. Chris made the process smooth and painless from test drive to financing.
They also have really good coffee!
Also, they inspected the car before leaving the lot and identified some minor damage on the vehicle. They gave me reassurance the damage would be fixed at no extra cost the following week. Which was awesome because I didn't notice it until they pointed it out!

I would give this place 5 stars except I did pay a rather exorbitant amount on the KARR alarm system (which was actually my bad for not reading the fine print and/or asking more questions). I should have not had it activated or maybe tried to get em to drop the price a little, but hey, they're just trying to pay their bills, so I don't blame them for offering it to me.

Overall, outstanding customer service, simple process, great coffee, good people and awesome car.

Thanks Chris!🤟😝<//text>

< Review>
I've been in searching for a compact luxury car for about a month, but was unsure as to what I wanted. Visited other dealerships but wasn't impressed with the inventory or salespeople 😑. Did some research on the 2015 Mercedes Benz GLK 350 and very was impressed. It was compact, cute and luxurious! Saw that Auto City had one for $18.8, 47k miles, 2015, all black. Literally went to AC on a whim on a Saturday (1/11/20) at 4pm, saw my car, test drove her, and purchased! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CAR! And I'm grateful for the wonderful sales people of Auto City.  Especially my girl Jessica!!! She did all the processing for me - she was patient and didn't make me feel like I was being haggled. I told her about my future career endeavors and she shared some info with me that will help me get there (thank you so much!).  Issac handled the contract and the money - he was great, too. This may seem awkward to say about car dealers, but they felt like "friends". My car buying experience wasn't dreadful... it was surprisingly pleasurable. THANK YOU SO MUCH! I'm referring EVERYONE!<//Review>

By far the best car buying experience! Everyone was very nice, but Mike and Ramil were the ones who took care of us. They were both very honest and did not make us feel pressured at all. Ramil was the one to work with us on finances and he helped us get our dream car with rates that worked for us! We will definitely be recommending this place to anyone who’s looking, thank you Auto City!<//text>

The service was excellent, Chris was a big help showed exactly what we asked for.
Best part was the test drive, they hand you the keys and take it out yourself give you that real experience.
paper work did take a little longer but they always updated us on what was going on and asked if we needed anything, great customer service. First time car buyer I would recommend coming to auto city<//review>

Auto city trader is a great dealership. The staff members were really nice and very helpful. They give me lots of advice and help on trying to find me a car. They give me lots of information on the cars history, accident reports, damages, previous owners too. The great thing is, Nellie gave me a call to set up an appointment to head to auto trader. Chris Samuels help me find a car that I could afford to drive and enjoy. The staff there are really nice and helpful. Thank you auto trader for you help and getting me a car!< /Review>

Overall my experience here was great. Stan helped me through out the financing process and picked up every time I called, had knowledge of all aspects of the loan approval process, and got me a decent APR considering my credit score. Mike the sales associate was very personable and even went above and beyond to get me floor mats for my BMW. Finally Isaac in financing was very thorough and explained all contracts extremely well for me and my father to understand. He breaks down the maintenance packages clearly so you know which ones are best for you and which ones you can pass on. The dealership even offers a 6 month or 6,000 mile warranty included in the sales price.  I highly recommend this dealership.<//text>

Auto City is an amazing place to purchase your next vehicle. My first contact was with Mike. When I called he explained to me the process and requested the required information/documents over the phone. Within the same day he had me approved for a loan. I came down two days later and met with Dimitry. Dimitry showed me the 2018 Dodge Caravan that I was interested in. He seemed very knowledgeable about the vehicle and showed me all the features. From there Isaac wrote up our agreement and got everything signed. Issac was very professional and explained in great detail the contract and what I needed to do following the purchase. I have to say this was an amazing car buying experience and will be recommending them to family and friends. I am currently writing this review as I wait for them to finish up cleaning my new vehicle. Another great reason to purchase from Auto City is they offer a complimentary 6,000 mile warranty.< /Text>

Go and ask for Jessica! She was a pleasure to work with. Not pushy at all, just very attentive and knowledgeable. Prices are very reasonable at this dealership. Not like traditional dealerships, this was a great experience. I did my homework and shopped around online, did not find any other place with the selection and pricing AutoCity has. Will recommend this place to family and friends. When you're there ask for Jessica. She was the best!<//Review>

<Text>I was hoping for a better used car buying experience. If you are too, you’ll want to avoid this place. I had an appointment to look at a car with Nellie on a Friday. She was so persistent that I make an appointment I told her I’d come a day early.  We confirmed via text that I’d be there within an hour and when I arrived she told me they sold the car.  I had a bad feeling about her but figured I give it a shot regardless of her cliché used car sales lines. She even mentioned that they are not a “bait and switch” car lot.  After this experience I definitely feel there game is to get customers there from ads on their website, tell them it “just sold” and sell them something else.<//Text>< user>

That was my first experience of buying a car in the United States. Alex and Isaac were super friendly and professional. They've understood that I was a bit nervous, and without hesitation explained me each part of the contract. I ended up having a great deal. Definitely recommend this dealership.</Review>

One of the best car buying experiences I've had in a long time.  Everyone was attentive and considerate. Not pushy at all.  Fair prices and fair financing terms.  Finance pushed the service contracts but when I said I wasn't interested they backed off.  Overall I would do business with them again.< /review>

<review>Great experience from the moment we walked in. Dmitry was awesome! Greeted us as soon as we walked in, worked with us finding a vehicle and through the whole finance process. He showed us the vehicle, walked us through all the features of the vehicle and everything the dealership has maintained on it as well. Very smooth, quick process. Prices were extremely fair. Highly recommend purchasing you next vehicle here!< /review>< Time>

Just got a Fiat 500e here. First class service and no-haggle pricing. Trade in value is decent as well. I worked with sales advisor Chris and Nellie, and they are both very knowledgeable and courteous. Overall it’s a very enjoyable process. I won’t hesitate buying from AutoCity again in future. Before then, I will be enjoying my Fiat 500e.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I just bought a 2018 Ford Fusion here and the whole experience was great. They have all their cars on the website complete with their (really good) prices, and when you go in they're very nice and not pushy at all. The price I saw on the website is the price I paid, and there were no upsells or haggling. (They do offer some extended warranties/protection plans/etc but they weren't upset when I declined them all.) I would definitely return here when I need to buy another car.< /Review>< pictures>

Reese over at Auto City took care of me. He and the sales manager were patient and highly motivated to work with me. I recommend if you are looking for an affordable and reliable car with honest sales staff. Go here! No nonsense.  No pushy sales. Was all on my own terms. Thanks again Reese and the whole gang at Auto City.</text>

<review>It’s been six months since I bought my car from Auto City. I couldn’t be happier with my car or the buying experience. They were professional and authentic, and the process was the fastest I’ve ever had in a car purchase. It was so good I plan on going back to buy my next car from them. Highly recommend Auto City.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< review>
They appear to have nice vehicles, customer service is erratic. We visited a few months ago and had a good experience. Didn't buy at that time, but the interaction was good.
We determined the specific car we want. There are ~5 virtually identical in the San Diego area (color, features, mileage, etc.). We wanted to buy from a local dealership to support their business. The vehicle is ~$1800 higher at AutoCity. Messaged with Franck L. the AutoCity Internet Sales Manager who said "you have visited us before and I believe know our pricing policy". No information on why the car is priced higher, no discussion.
When they say "no negotiation" that appears to also mean "no communication - take our price or go elsewhere". We are definitely going elsewhere.
If this is their attitude when starting the sales process, what kind of service would follow?</review>

Auto City had a car available just like we wanted--the same day that we called them! Alex told us about it, and helped us very professionally. He let us test drive by ourselves, and then quickly fixed us up to take it to our mechanic to check out. The car had low mileage, was in great shape, and very clean. Alex made sure we knew what was happening at every step. He acted on our concerns for final detailing on the car. A great car buying experience with Alex!< /text>

I scheduled a test drive online and they held the vehicle for free. The website was simple and not cluttered with pop ups which was nice to see.

When I arrived at the dealership they were extremely accommodating and allowed me to test drive without a dealer in the car. While I was there I was also able to look at other vehicles that I did not bring up ahead of time.

It was a pleasure working with Alfred and Chris, and I recommend anyone who is looking for a new car to stop here first to avoid unnecessary pressure and haggling.

Thanks!<//Text>

I purchased a vehicle here a few days ago and I want to specifically thank Stan who made the process so easy for me and Mike for the delivery of the car and paperwork. They communicated well with me. If you are looking for a used car stop by autocity in El Cajon and ask for those two. They will take care of you for sure.< /review>

Mine was not your typical shopping experience.  I'm a filmmaker and I had just finished shooting a car for my 2nd feature "the 10th RIDE" (a little 2010 Chevy Aveo that I had sunk a ton of cash into to making it road ready for the movie and personal use).  I had already owned a 2012 Fiat 500 and hoped I could find one for the movie but in Michigan, where filming began, there was no one to be found that suited our needs.  I finished filming the road trip portion of the movie with the Aveo in Los Angeles.  Knowing the time with the Aveo was coming to an end, I had already begun searching the SoCal area for a Fiat.  I like shopping for cars so after a few months using things like Cargurus, Carfax, Craigs, Dealer sites etc. I found the used Fiat of my dreams!  The only thing was it was almost three hours away but the superior condition of the vehicle, the outstanding price (especially compared to MI prices for the same vehicle), the transparent selling, professional and clear website, the friendly and trustworthy staff motivated me out the door for a nice ride down the coast.  I didn't have the time I needed to sell my Aveo before showing up but they gave me a fair purchase price.  I took the shiny and bright Fiat for a test drive and when I parked it I noticed a bit of a burning oil smell which they recognized.  They made a deal with me that I could not pass up.  They would repair the oil issue for free, and since I had already sold my car (paper work filed) they would comp me an Uber to Amtrack, reimburse me the ticket and ship my Cherry Pop Fiat complimentary to my Hollywood address.  The entire staff including Corey in the garage were super, patient and accommodating to the end and when I say the end; we closed the shop with this transaction.

YES, WOW!!!<//Text>

The car selection and customer service was great and worth stopping by to look at any of the new or used cars.
Sam was nice and friendly to talk to and very helpful about answering any questions you have about any car you might be interest in checking out.
I highly recommend checking this spot out in person or looking at their website next time you go car shopping.< /Text>

< review>
I came to Auto City with my wife to just browse cars while my current vehicle was being serviced across the street. It had been a couple years since my last purchase(also from Auto City). I can say I am constantly blown away by their selection. I was first greeted by Sam, who chatted with us for a bit about our current cars. I mentioned plans to upgrade my wife’s car soon, but not that day. He led us to 3 different SUV’s that fit exactly what we were looking for.
I emailed him a few days later and he responded immediately. I researched a couple dozen dealers and their inventory and nobody had the options and great price that Auto City did. I let Sam know I was impressed with the prices they had but wanted to see my cars trade in value. From there, due to Sam helping other customers, and not wanting me to wait a long time,  he put me in the hands of someone he said was just as great. That would be Reese. And he was right. Both had a wonderful attitude and helped the process fly by. I was happy with the price of the new car, the trade in value and the diligence and hard work they put in to finance us the best deal possible. They worked together and checked in on us constantly while waiting to get everything finalized. There’s not a better dealership when it comes to the people, the inventory and the price!</review>

Amazing service. This is the first place I went to when I was looking for a new car and ended up being the only place I needed to go. They answered every question I had (which was a lot because I’ve only ever bought privately through family prior to this) and made sure I got the best deal. Chris was helping me and he was so friendly, helpful, not pushy at all and helped me leave with a car I’m absolutely in love with. I would definitely recommend this place.<//Review>

I have to say we had a very pleasant experience when visiting Auto City, we were in need of a new family car something reliable. Sam was the one who helped us look at a few car he was very helpful and showed us a few cars that we liked. He assisted with our paperwork processes and made everything easy to understand. No pushy sales, he listend to us and what we could afford and worked with his team to get us in the right vehicle for us. Everyone was so helpful from the finance team to signing the paperwork to checking on us to see if we were comfortable and needed anything while we waited. Buying a car can be stressful and frustrating the folks at Auto City do there absolute best to make that processes as easy as possible. We will defiantly be going back for any future needs we love the vehicle we got. Thank you all for your outstanding service to us.< /Text>

This is the best dealer experience I've had. Stan worked some miracles with my financing and gave me a good idea of what my payments would look like before I even came to shop. He also made sure that I got the best extended warranty on my car.

Mike was very knowledgeable and low pressure, and even walked back and forth between my last two choices several times in order to help me make my decision. He also did my final paperwork with me and explained everything in detail. I'll be back to visit Stan and Mike if I need a car in the future. They are the best!< /review>

<review>It was a very smooth experience.  I found a vehicle on their lot via AutoTrader on Sunday night, was able to come in on Monday to test drive it, and then they worked on arranging the financing and I picked up the car on Tuesday.  Usually I dread going into a dealership to purchase a car, but they went out of their way to make it a smooth experience and answer all my questions.  I would certainly recommend them to anyone that needs a partner in finding a good used car.</review>< pictures>

UPDATE: We loved auto city so much, we came back for a second car. Great service AGAIN.
Today we purchased a Nissan Rogue. Obed was very helpful and walked us through each step. They went above and beyond to help us feel comfortable with our purchase. Our car was detailed before we left. I was even able to have a coffee while we waited! Highly recommend!< /text>

We had a great experience buying from Sam and the rest of the guys at Auto City. I let Sam know what I was looking for and he let me know when they had those vehicles in stock. There was never any pressure to buy. My wife and I went in to look at a car about an hour before closing on a Saturday. We decided to buy and all the guys stayed late to take care of us. The financing is easy too. They take your info and compare offers from different financial institutions so you don't have to spend time doing it yourself. We got our car under market value and had our mechanic check it out with no issues. I highly recommend Sam for your next used car.<//review>

I worked with Alex Butov to purchase my new car and it was the easiest and most enjoyable car buying experience I have ever had. Alex was friendly, knowledgeable and no-pressure at all. He showed me some great options for my car and walked me through the trade-in process for my old car. The trade-in value was perfectly fair. Financing was a breeze with competitive rates. Alex is the best car salesman I have ever met. Auto City is lucky to have him. Do not hesitate to visit Auto City for your car needs.</text>

Overall a great experience! Was not bombarded by sales men when entering the lot. Was able to look around freely. Car I requested for hold was held with my name on it, which was pretty cool. I dealt with Mike who didn’t pressure me to buy any extra upgrade or add any hidden fees. Overall very smooth buying experience! Would highly recommend getting your next car here if you don’t like the sharks at other dealerships. Straight forward a friendly people throughout. I am 100% satisfied with my service today.<//text>

Michelle G was so patient with me and she was so nice towards my family and I. She helped us a lot and I enjoyed working with her. When ever we had a question she always had an answer for us. If you ever consider buying a new car I recommend going to auto city and ask for Mitchell’s G she is such a kind soul and she will help you with anything you need.</text>

<text>This was my 9th vehicle purchase from a dealership.

No hassle No haggling and we got the best deal we could find within 100 miles. Chris was amazingly helpful and worked with me without any pressure even when I used my own financing and didn’t want any extras on the car.

They also provided a great warranty for our vehicle up to 100k miles good nationwide.

We were in and out relatively quick and have the piece of mind as if we had a brand new car but without all the depreciation and up sales.

Thank you for a great experience Chris.</text>< name>

I bought my first car from them a 2015 Chrysler 200 and held onto it for 3 years until I got an email to come in and trade it. I test drove 3 cars and the one I ended up picking was a little bit high end and slightly out of my price range. They were able to negotiate a great deal for me walking out the door and I’m completely satisfied. Thank you Obed for the hospitality and attentive service.<//Text>

<Text>I've bought two cars now from Stan@ AutoCity El Cajon! Stan was proactive, and pressure free approach. He listened to what we wanted, and found the perfect  at a great value. Regardless the current virus situation, Stan was able to have my new 2019 Nissan Sentra deliver to my home. Highly recommended my friends & family to stop by AutoCity El Cajon ask for Stan.< /Text>< Pics>

One of the BEST experiences I've ever had buying a vehicle! I went car shopping after my BK discharge...everywhere I applied...Results were: Sorry we can't find a bank that will finance you/ need a co-signer/DP $3,500.  I started searching for dealerships that finance people after BK, Auto City came up, it was late at night when I submitted the application.  The next morning I get a call from Stan- very friendly and professional- telling me they had received my application and needed proof of income/references/and other docs to submit my application to the bank.  He also asked me what type of car/suv/truck i was interested in purchasing.  I made my selection and that same day Stan calls telling me that I was approved.  All this was done while I was at work :)
The next day I drove to El Cajon to pick up my 2018 Hyundai Elantra! Mike explained the contract terms/warranty/and answered all my questions.  They even offered me a 7 day trial exchange...3 days driving my car and I love my new car.  No way I'm sending it back.  All in all I would highly recommend Auto City of El Cajon.</review>

Chris took great care of my husband and I. I cannot recommend him and the entire Auto City team enough! We had a very unique situation and they were able to take care of us with no issue. I have referred all of my closest friends to Auto City and will not go anywhere else ever again for our vehicle needs.<//Review>

I have driven by many times never stopped in. Today I felt like stopping in. I walked the lot and was not bothered by sales people. I had one sales guy come out I said I'm just walking the lot looking at cars and was left alone. I think the cars are pretty much junk. It's just the truth. I did not see anything that I would want to buy. I'm sure customers might like the cars, I just don't think they are worth checking out.< /Text>

The customer service at this dealership is freaking fantastic, right when you come in, they are ready to greet you and help you as fast as they can. Also setting up an appointment in advance was very helpful and makes the experience more enjoyable. The person who helped me, Alfred, was also a great seller and very honest with the options that he had for me. Highly recommend it for those who are new buyers.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Getting my car here was extremely easy; the staff took care of almost everything. The price was set, so I didn't have to haggle. They walked me through the paperwork and made sure I understood it. I mostly just sat around and answered a few questions while they took care of everything else. There were offers, but there wasn't any pressure to buy extra features.

Easy, low pressure, and I'm very happy with the car and deal that I got.< /review>< pics>

<Review>I recently purchased my second used car from them.  Chris was very helpful and straightforward.  Buying a car can be a stressful experience , I traded in my previous car (originally purchased from them) at the Kelly Blue book price and purchased another vehicle with no haggling etc.  If you are looking for a used car I highly recommend Auto City.

Although I test drove nearly 5 different cars he was very patient and was very knowledgeable about every model I was interested in! In the end he helped me pick out a new car for my family with a deal I just could not pass up! Their coffee is also the best I’ve ever had lol so that’s a plus !<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I was shopping around for a good while for a new car. A family friend recommended me over to Auto City. I'm glad I took the advise. I went over to Auto city and was greeted by Chris Samuels. He was very professional and helpful and answered all my questions. He showed me the vehicle I was interested in. Jorge the manager came over and worked a great deal with me. Now I am the proud owner of a 2017 Honda Accord. I am very please and couldn't ask for a more pleasant experience. I would highly recommend Chris, Jorge, and Auto City to friends and family.</Review></record>

Awesome car Shopping experience!! ALFRED MENDOZA was very helpful and very sincere.  He was honest and very trusting and understanding of our situation.  We got the car we wanted and at better than market price so we didn't need to look elsewhere.  This is a highly recommended place to check out first before you go elsewhere.  We will definitely come here again when we are ready for another new car.<//Text>

I recently filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and found myself desperately in need of a reliable vehicle to help me get to and from work. I was referred to Stan at Auto City who was extremely helpful, patient, and understanding of my situation. Stan goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied and comfortable during the car buying experience. He took the time to help me choose the right vehicle for my situation and budget without making me feel rushed or pressured. With Stan's help I was able to purchase 2018 Hyundai Elantra with $0 down and payments I could afford!! I will be a customer for life!!</text>

< Review>
I had never enjoyed purchasing a vehicle from anyone before as much as I enjoyed purchasing a vehicle from Mike.  My wife and I showed up on a Saturday and even though every sales associate was busy with other customers (including Mike,) Mike acknowledged us and told us that he would help us shortly.  No other sales associate even lifted their heads while they were with other customers. His attentiveness did not stop there.  He went on to qualify us and showed us a couple of cars that my wife and I were considering.  As a former salesperson myself, I have high expectations when it comes to customer service.  I once walked out in the middle of a sale at BMW of Escondido simply because I did not like how I was being treated.  Not at Auto City.  Mike's friendly, honest, and vibrant demeanor made the entire process pleasant and clear.  Mike is such a down to earth and helpful person that I was incredibly happy to give him my business.  Between Mike and Jose (over at finance) Auto City has something special going on.  I will definitely purchase my next vehicle from Auto City and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good quality car, with amazing customer service to go along with it.  Thanks guys!< /Review>

Just purchased our 2016 Honda Odyssey from Auto City. Worked with Alex, he did a great job running us through the process and getting us the vehicle while getting us a good trade in deal. They were not overly pushy when we first showed an interest in buying a vehicle and their patience proved a welcomed relief compared to the overbearing carsalesmen at your average dealership. The vehicle was in a great condition and has worked flawlessly so far. Overall, a really good experience at Auto City.</Text>

While I’d love to give this place 5 stars, their customer service after you purchase a vehicle is absolutely awful! They will harass you to get a 5 star review and give you great customer service through the purchase process, they just don’t follow through on their agreements. I have bought 3 vehicles from them and on the 3rd they offered to give me a free oil change on the second vehicle I purchased. Guess what, after over an hour sitting and waiting no oil change and I now have to take more time off work to get this done... that is, if they ever call me back and follow through on the agreement.

Such a shame that their great efforts are all for nothing once the sale is made.< /review>

So I m very skeptical about car dealers and I don't trust them. But Auto city changed my mind about that. First they have the best cars, very clean, flawless and with low mileage. Two, they are priced way lower than other dealers.
We bought our first hybrid from Auto city in 2012, then another one in 2013, then another one in 2014 and this week we bought another car from them. We are not going to buy a car from another dealer. We are very happy with them. They are honest, not pressure you to buy, and their prices are reasonable.</text>

A lot of previous dealerships I've been to always change the price of what you originally see or originally is offered. That was not the case here the exact price i seen online is exactly what was offered. I had a vehicle trade in and told them what i was looking to get for it and they gave me exactly that. there was not a lot of going back and forth with disagreements or tough bargaining. It was one of the most simple processes I've had when buying a car. I dealt with Chris Samuels. He was super nice and understanding. Very easy and pleasant to work with. All employees seem nice and trustworthy. Definitely recommend if looking for a trusted dealership!</review>

<review>As soon as my family and i stepped on the lot, there were friendly salesmen ready to help us out and answer our questions. They gave us a moment to look around and they were ready whenever we were without pushing a car on a us and trying to sell with pressure. Felt really comfortable and answered my questions in an understandable way... being a first time buyer, it was a really great experience and Chris and two others (cant recall names) were a great help!! Wish i wouldve came here first before other dealers.</review>< Pictures>

<review>These guys are amateurs, I bought my car over a month ago and I’ve gotten a call a week from them asking me to finish paperwork that they forget to get me to fill out during the 4 hours I was in the office during purchase.  4 different calls asking me to come back into the office and ask me to fill out paperwork.  This place is not worth it, find a place that knows what they’re doing if you’re gonna spend money on a car.</review>< GmapID>

My best friend referred me to Auto City in El Cajon. I'm so glad she did. My old car was super old with a new problem every other week. I decided to come in to Auto City after hearing how great they were. I work full time so I inquired online and within minutes Franck had reached out to me and set an appt with me around my schedule which I appreciate so much. I came in to Auto City and was immediately greeted by the entire staff. I worked with Chris Samuel's the entire process. He was explained everything very well and thorough. Was super patient and answered all of my questions accurately. I was so nervous and anxious and Chris made the entire experience super smooth. I cannot recommend enough!< /review>

<userid>105548187676811432204</userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I ended up looking for a new car unexpectedly when my car was totaled in an accident. I spent a few days researching online, and a few days going to different dealerships. Auto City was out of the way of most of the ones I went to, and I am so glad I made the time to go. The first difference between Auto City and all of the other dealerships I went was that neither Victor (who helped me on my first visit) nor Fraser (who helped me on my second and third visits) tried to rush me into a decision. Every other dealership was more concerned with how quickly they could sell me a car than they were with ensuring that I was going to be satisfied with my purchase. For example, one dealership insisted that I test drive only the car I felt the most like purchasing to streamline the process. At Auto City, I test drove six cars before I could decide which one I was happiest with, and Fraser was patient and happy to offer up tips and information about the cars I drove. Both Victor and Fraser were very knowledgeable about the vehicles I asked about. When it came down to purchasing my vehicle, Fraser helped me get a great loan - one even better than my own bank was willing to give me.

On top of everything else, I found more high-quality used vehicles within my price range at Auto City than I did anywhere else. Their vehicles were all cleaned, inside and out, and shined like they had been waxed even though it rained almost every day that week. It was clear that Auto City cares equally about the state of their vehicles and their customer's happiness - quite a lot. If I'm ever in the market for a car again or a friend needs a recommendation, Auto City is the way to go.</Review><time>1447191545222< /time>< Rating>

<review>Mike was amazing he was so polite and helpful as well as everyone else who works there. They have a great team and will go there to purchase more cars for the family. They aren’t pushy they are very accommodating. Auto City  El Cajon really has a way of making you feel like family. They helped my disabled mom get a safe and affordable car that meets all of her needs. I look forward to doing more business with them. Thank you guys!< /review>< pictures>

The process of checking out and eventually buying my car was so easy and straightforward. No pressure to move faster than we wanted to on a decision. Dmitri was an excellent sales rep. Got to test drive our Golf Sportwagen TDI on our own and then came back to check out the numbers. Took it home and pulled the trigger the next day when my wife and  I  were confident the car was the right one for us at the right price. Honest and fair pricing. Plus they promised to touch up some paint chips this week when I return  for a full detail. I purchased on  a Sunday so the service department was closed. So they clearly go above and beyond.< /text>< rating>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Thank you so much to AutoCity. We called on our way down from LA and asked them to hold a car we were looking at. They said they could hold until 3 pm. As we arrived we overheard a staff member letting another couple know the vehicle was on hold until 3 pm (as they indicated to us on the phone). To us, it made us feel like we were dealing with an honest company.

We ended up buying the car for the discounted price that it was advertised as. We initially thought it was too good to be true.

We were very happy with our experience.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<time>1564636588309<//time><rating>5</rating><Text>Truly one of the best car buying experiences I have ever had.  The team there went above and beyond with helping get what I would consider to be one of the best condition 1998 BMW M3s out there.  It's a 21 year old car and it was in immaculate condition.  Still can't believe I own it.  I'm from the Bay Area and actually flew down to the dealership in El Cajon to buy it.  There was never any pressure to buy and with the no haggle prices, you just can't go wrong.  If you live in Southern California or even if you don't, I highly recommend checking out Auto City for your next car purchase.  I especially wanted to thank Nellie, Fareez and Chris for making the whole experience so enjoyable and providing such great customer service.   You guys rock!!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I have had excellent care and service in every department I have had to encounter. Sales, finance, and service department. I initially had anxiety about purchasing a car alone, but as a young woman I walked into the dealer and felt very comfortable and confident the entire duration of my visit, and didn’t have to spend half of my day at the dealer to purchase my car. JR is a very friendly and thorough salesperson. I came in pre-approved through my credit union and they got me a much better APR through another lender. I’m beyond satisfied.< /text>< gmapID>

I enjoyed my experience very much at a
Auto City. The car salesman Mike is a very good rep for the company. He provided me with a lot of information that I didn't know about as far as purchasing a car by myself for the first time. He also tried to get me the best deal that was out there that was within my budget. I couldn't have asked for a better person to help me find a good reliable car. Thanks Mike! You're awesome!<//review>

Let me start with saying WOW. I have to honestly say that this is the best customer service I have ever received. Straight up, no haggling, no sales talk and no pressure. Follow up is excellent and they care ...very rare in this industry. I will never go anywhere else for my auto purchase needs and I recommend all my family and friends. They are a pretty tough act to follow for other dealerships. Fantastic through and through. Thanks Mike and Sam! You are awesome, keep up the great work!<//review>

Auto City provides the absolute best car buying experience. I submitted my application online and by the time I got to the dealership there were already 3 lenders ready to approve my loan with my low credit score. My sales guy Alfred was patient and very helpful. Jorge is the finance manager and he was amazing to work with. He got me payments that I could afford with a low down payment. Then on my way out the door after my car purchase they ask me if the could by my hunk of junk car that I didn't think anyone would buy. Got $800 for it and rolled away in my new Infinity Q40 in about an hour in a half. These guys are by far the best.  Oh, and when I priced my car at other dealerships it was about $1500 cheaper at Auto City.<//Text>

Obed was very helpful and even offered to help me lower my auto insurance. It was this step that made me make my final decision. He was willing to work within my very strict budget. I appreciate his salesmanship. You have a value in this representative.
Thank you,

My experience purchasing a used car at Auto City was nothing less than excellent.  My son-in-law and myself were served by both Jorge and Marco who listened to me, provided  us an opportunity to test drive the car of my choice, and then together we negotiated a price that would work for my budget and allow them a profit margin as well.  There was no pressure, no rushing us for a decision - I am grateful for the respect they showed me and would highly recommend anyone to visit them and see what it is like to shop for a car with no hassle.  It was pleasant and we all parted pleased with the contract.  I really like my new-to-me, gently used car!!< /Text>

We are so glad that we chose to go here for a car! The salesman Sam helped us through the whole process and made it fun, the time went by so fast. We were able to test drive 3 cars and Sam still made sure that we were happy with our selection. The financing process was so simple and our credit is not that great.  If there were more stars I would put them. Even a few days later Sam and the service department are more than willing to answer any type of questions we have. Our car is amazing, we live our Acura MDX!< /Text>

Salesman Obed is an outstanding salesman. Down to earth, funny, and a kind person. Not pushy. Worked with me on selecting the car that caught my attention, same day visit and left with the car I wanted. Thanks Obed, I recommend future customers to go to him for auto sales.<//review>

Obed made finding and purchasing a vehicle easy. Called in advanced to see if they still had the vehicle I was looking for in inventory. When I arrived it was all ready to go for a test drive and was able to make a decision on the vehicle without and pressure from the dealer. All around a pleasant experience.<//text>

<text>Had a great experience with this dealership.  I especially appreciated the ability to quickly test drive a vehicle without any pressure before or after.  Ultimately I did end up purchasing a new truck and trading in my older car.  Their trade-in value was very reasonable as was the price of the new truck.  The sales associate, Mike, was a pleasure to deal with and made the process as transparent as possible - I was also pleased with the interest rate they were able to secure for me.  Would come here again and recommend without hesitation!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I have waited 6 weeks to write this review.  Wanted to make sure that everything was complete and finalized with no hitches.
Everything worked like clockwork.  Everyone was fantastic and these people know exactly what they are doing.
Mike is Amazing, Jose was Fantastic and everything went exactly as they had promised.  Our "like new" 2018 VW Tiguan is perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful experience.  I would purchase from them again with no reservations.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Marco and Jorge made my first car purchase stress free and super easy. They didn’t push me and force me to take a car and actually listened to my needs when it came to how much I can pay per month and gave me solid advice. Def recommend if you want a great experience no pushy sellers that want to make quotas just honest people trying to help everyone that walks through their doors.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd</Gmap_id></record>

<review>I couldn't possibly recommend these guys more. Great selection, awesome no hassle staff. They got me into a nice car even before my bankruptcy was finalized. Two months later when I noticed some chipped paint on the bumper they got it repainted for free, filled my gas tank, detailed the car, and replaced a defunct windshield spray nozzle for free. Never thought I'd see something like that.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Aloha! I am completely satisfied with the service I got at Auto City and the car deal they provided me with. Everything went so smoothly and fast, I came all the way from Oceanside to get to Auto City just because of their commitment to assist me for an entire week trying to get me out there to buy the car I wanted. I ran into a lot of challenges but regardless Auto City employees such as Mike and JR still made the deal happen! I highly recommend this dealership and the salesmen there to anyone who is looking for a car especially if you are in the military or stationed out here in California, they will take care of you like they did for me and countless others!<//Text>

I really put these boys through the ringer. I had a handful of cars I thought would be good for me and they let me drive each one of them, some of them more than once just to help me decide! They held on to a car for me as I figured out my choices too. The salesmen knew all about the vehicles and were able to provide some insight on which car I may like, because they listened carefully to what I needed and wanted. The prices of the vehicles were great, so the need to haggle was out the door. They didn't have any hidden fees or services. Everything was transparent. I love the way they test drive. They just give you the keys and the car is yours for little while, which is what you really need when deciding. I'd go to them for my next car, for sure. There's a reason they are an award-winning lot!</text>

< review>
I had spent several days looking at cars online through USAA and had really set my eyes on one particular vehicle at Auto City. I had some pretty specific requirements (beige leather interior, light colored exterior, good gas mileage) and the Audi they had fit all those boxes. I only had a couple of days in San Diego to look for a vehicle so I went to check it out first thing in the morning.

I am glad I did because I had a great experience! I haven't had a vehicle for three years so I was a little overwhelmed in general, but Alex met me on the lot almost immediately and after talking a couple minutes he knew why I had my eyes set on that particular vehicle. I had already been approved for a loan thru my bank and they weren't pushy about the financing aspect.

I left the lot with my new car a couple hours later! Although I had some doubts I rushed the purchase due to my time constraints, I am very happy with the vehicle (purchased over 2 weeks ago). They don't have any old clunky lemons on the lot, and they also offer a free 6 month warranty on the engine which is reassuring. Whatever vehicle you walk away with, it will be mechanically sound and you won't be hassled. Thanks Alex!<//review>

Obed was very helpful and courteous...not pushy at all. He and his manager Jorge worked with me so that I could afford the payments. After looking in several other lots and being attacked by salesmen, even my husband made the comment, "Now this is the way to buy a car". I recommend trying Auto City first.</Review>

<Text>Came across this place as highly recommended. I was trying to downgrade from our SUV and just needed a small, practical car. I went over to Auto City and surprised that they have great selections of affordable cars and most of all they do not force you or stress you into getting a car. Mike helped us into getting to a car that we came for. Most dealers will try to get you an expensive car just so they can make more but this place listedned to our needs & wants which is we wanted an affordable car that we can save money on the monthly payments and save on gas as well. We got a car that is practically brand new with so little mileage. I will def purchase my next car in the future again and hope that’s Stan & Mike are still there to assist us as they are awesome. They not only tend to us at the time of purchased but also helped us with minor questions right after. Highly recommend this place. 5 stars!< /Text></record>

I have to say I was skeptical to buy a car from Auto city. But after reading the reviews, and  the price of my Audi 2018 Q5 was a fair market price. My husband and I took the drive to the dealership. The car was great, but we where not ready to pull the trigger, and we needed to shop some more Cars. We went to Carmax , Audi dealer and Lexus as well. And after all the car shopping we wanted the Audi. So, I could not get down to the dealership right away with my husband, so Mike & Al put the car on hold for us. That was a big relief . We are very happy with our car and the service. The only thing I would say, Is on Sunday they where so busy, that we could not keep the action of one sale person. They had to take turns working with us. .And the car did not come with a set of two keys. But over all 5 stars.<//Text>

It wasn't a mistake going back to Auto City. We were greeted with nice people who knew how to treat their customers like VIPs', especially Obed. He was our man! He was so patient, giving us all the cars we wanted to test-drive. At the end of the day, we got 2 cars. Thanks to Jose and Jorge,  who did all the paperworks with excellence. And of course, to the owners, Stan and Dennis who still remember us after so many years. More power to you, guys!

<text>Absolutely the best service I have ever encountered at a car dealership. Mike M was our salesman and he was incredible. Explained everything in detail and made us feel extremely relaxed and like family.
Stan the finance man helped us in so many ways from getting financed right after filing bankruptcy to keeping his word about their 3-day return policy. See after I sat on my decision about buying the extended warranty I chose to cancel it. Stan and Mike (without hesitation) had me come in and wrote up a new contract with my wishes. And refunded my account. Talk about (HONESTY), these guys are true to their word. Next car I buy is through Autocity. Thank you, Mike and Stan!<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Was in need of a good deal and new car ASAP . Got into a car accident and had about enough with my old car with all the breakdowns and repairs I had put into it. I put an online request to find out how much I would receive for my car if I traded it in. And they got to me super quick, even gave me a phone call to confirm certain details I had listed. They invited me to come in and I got matched with the dealer Chris Samuels. He was super insightful and helpful and made the process so easy and smooth. I’m now a proud new owner of a Honda Civic with mileage that you can’t beat. Was looking to go to CarMax who didn’t really have a lot of options and Auto City had the best deals I’ve seen. For sure ask for Chris Samuels of you are in need of a new car !< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

After an unfortunate accident that totaled my car I was forced to go into the car searching atmosphere which is definitely not my favorite thing to do
After visiting multiple dealerships and getting pushed around by one finance guy I ended up calling Auto city

I was greeted by Michelle who instantly eased my tense ordeal at a previous dealership.  She was super friendly, extremely attentive, answered all my questions and was very patient with me as this was a big purchase for me.  She asked what my wants were and tailored me to a few cars to test drive.  She made me feel at ease by letting me test drive each car by myself with no rush whatsoever on pulling the trigger to buy

After a few days of research on each car I test drove I made the decision to purchase a 2014 Toyota Prius c which is perfect for my commute to work and school and for my daily life as a runner

I also want to thank John the finance manager who worked with me to a lower than expected APR rate while tacking on the extended warranty and keeping my monthly payment lower than what I was paying for for my previous vehicle

Again a huge thanks to Michelle, John and everyone at Auto City!<//text>

Offered coffee and water periodically, kept me updated through the whole process and made the experience very comfortable and quick. This is a great dealership with a large assortment of vehicles at very reasonable prices. As it was recommended to me I would recommend them to you!<//Text>< resp>

I bought my used 2005 Subaru Forester XT from this place 6 years ago. It was a pleasant buying experience. I checked out the car that I wanted. Took it for a test drive. And was sold after that. I didn't get hassled to buy the vehicle. The transaction was smooth. I'd definitely consider buying from this dealership again.</review>

<Text>I really don't know where to begin but this place helped me into my first brand new car. They work very fast and efficiently. I had filed bankruptcy and they were still able to do the application and approve me while it was open. I got the car I wanted and the customer service was great. Stan the finance manager started everything for me and from him I met Michael who helped me with test driving the vehicles. Once I chose my vehicle everything was finalized through Ramil. These guys are on top of everything. All their cars are new with low mileage and low prices. From what I hear they're starting a raffle next month and winnings go towards your car payments. I'm just telling my experience and why you all need to see them. Please tell them Jaimie referred you if you want. Trust these guys, because now me and my son are styling in a new ride and were loving life right now!< /Text><gmapID>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd<//gmapID>< Resp>

Buying a vehicle here with Mike and the entire staff was as easy as it gets.  No pressure , no haggle, just straight forward, quick and easy.  I felt the price was better than any other place I looked, we had a little battery issue right after I bought the car and Auto City bent over backwards to make sure it was taken care of.  I recieved calls from both Mike my salesman and Jay (shop manager) to make sure the situation was taken care of quickly and to my satisfaction. I have purchased several vehicles from different dealers and this was by far the quickest, and easiest place to deal with,  I highly recommend these guys and will definitely do business with them again.<//Review>

<Text>If you are in the market for a new or used car, Chris @ auto city in El Cajon is the man you need to go see. I have bought a few cars from dealerships before and this is by far the smoothest, chillest and most professional car salesman I have ever dealt with. Zero pressure, none whatsoever. He worked with my wife while I was on deployment but she didnt want to get a car while I was away because it was a big purchase and chris understood that. Even though he knew she wasn't going to purchase until I get back, he still let her test drove the cars she was interested in until I got back. Super cool dude, even when he is dealing with multiple customers at once.. highly reccomend him.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great experience at Auto City. Most of my credit application was done over the phone with Dmitry, and when I came down, the car was ready and clean for me. Smooth ride and a nice and powerful car. A five start review was more than appropriate.<//Text>

When I picked the car I liked from the lot and took it for a test drive it had acceleration issues. I was already hooked on wanting the car, so I trusted the service dept to fix the issue. It took them a day to fix which was a but aggravating but I fell in love with the car and wanted it. Because of this issue, the service tech was a standup guy who I felt I could trust, and the fact I know nothing about Acuras; I purchased the $2500 service plan. The reason I’m giving this place two stars is the $2500 I spent on the service plan is basically flushed down the toilet. It is impossible to get an appointment reasonably for car service. I’ve called nearly every four months for the past two years to get my car serviced here and every single time they tell me the schedule is full for two weeks. They won’t offer any alternative like calling you if a cancellation happens and you’re able to be squeezed in. they tell me if my car isn’t running or is in need of immediate service I can drop it off and a service technician can take a look at it when they get around to it or by the time my appointment is scheduled (which is two weeks). So essentially I’m dropping my car off and getting a rental car until their service technician can take a look at it hopefully within the next two weeks; which is ludicrous. i’ve also called a number of times to get clarification on my service plan to see if a part is covered under the plan like a starter. they don’t have any information on the service plan that you purchased; you have to call the service plan 800 number. So while my experience purchasing the car at this dealership was OK the after care and the interactions with the service department have been absolutely miserable.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Purchased a Honda CR-V and was very pleased with service - Sales associate Dimitri and Manager Fariz were very accommodating and up front with info and provided opportunities to take my time and drive/
Ask all Qs and satisfaction. This included Jose finance associate who allowed us flexibility and was fully transparent with all functions so that we could clarify any refunds or adjustments and warranty Qs with satisfaction.< /Review>

< Review>
I bought exceptionally good 2016 Honda Odyssey in Auto City. I was assured that the car has no issues and when I took it to an official dealership 3 days later they confirmed that there is nothing to do with the car and it's in a perfect condition.

The staff there is so easy to communicate with, they behave like your friends and don't push hard on you. They did push a little on their extended warranty, so I had to listen for 20 minutes what it is and why I need it even though I previously said I don't need it, but it does not compare with the pressure in any official dealership, where they try to squeeze every single dollar out of you.

Financial department there does need some improvement, because they are not willing to get you the lowest rate possible. Initially they gave me 5.99% interest rate with my Excellent credit score, I asked them to search better and in a minute they found 4.99%. I expected it to be around 4.0% or less, but they said there is nothing better. When I signed the contract I found out that the financial company is "Auto City Sales", not a bank or credit union, so they were extremely interested to keep the interest rate as high as possible, because it's their direct profit. Anyways, it's not a big deal.

I like their website and high quality photos of the cars, free CarFax reports. The price you see there is what you will actually pay if you decline their extended warranty and KARR security system.

Overall, I like my experience with Auto City very much. My personal recommendation goes to Alex - ask for him, he's really willing to find you the car you want for the price you need.<//Review>

<text>I have purchased many vehicles from dealerships and even have utilized a personal car broker.  I'd have to say that this was the most seamless, efficient, and pleasant car buying experience that I have ever had.  Jose is a very knowledgeable sales professional with vast understanding of vehicle brands, make and model reliability, service information, technology, and purchasing.  On top of everything, he was a very personable professional that made the whole car buying experience enjoyable. I appreciate the extra effort that he put to provide great customer service such as providing us with hot coffee, moving all the cars I was interested in side by side, etc.  The most amazing part of my experience was that I was  literally out the door in one hour with my new car.  Thanks for everything and I highly recommend Auto City and Jose Martinez for any used car purchases.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<name>Veronica Borja</name><date>1563579608176< /date><rating>1</rating><Review>Hey everyone! I currently got a phone call this morning regarding a car that I was looking at. I got a call from a girl name Raquel, she was helping me this morning. She told me to do a credit check so I have all my info, she said that they can probably help me with what I wanted to put down and she will give me a call back in 30 mins. She never called back so I gave her a call and asked if they were able to help and she once again said she will call back in 20 mins she has to check and see if she can pass it through. She never called back, I would’ve appreciated a simple call back saying she wouldn’t be able to help instead of just leading me on. But I definitely won’t be recommending this place due to their customer service. They didn’t help me out at all.</Review>< pics>

I had a great experience financing my car here. I had fair credit score, so, I was skeptical when I walked in here of getting a reasonable financing options. However, JR , the sales person welcomed me cordially, although, originally, I was scheduled to see Mike. Mike still came over during my purchase and made sure, if I was having a good experience. JR was awesome and patience during the whole process. He made sure, if I was getting the right car for the right financing option. He even contacted me few days after my final purchased, if I was happy with my car. Also, Jorge was a great financing manager. He was patience enough to get me the lowest APR option possible for my situation. They don't force you to purchase anything, rather, they will try to accommodate you according to your needs in a pleasent way. I will  Highly Recommend this place.<//Review>

Wow! Ask for Alfred Mendoza if you come here and you won't be sorry!  Great service, fast, no pushy sales tactics, and fair prices.  I have only bought from a dealer once before and this was a much better experience the second go-around. Got a 2015 Nissan Leaf and they were very careful to get us the CarFax report immediately and let us take the car for a spin without sending a "babysitter" along for the ride.  I felt very comfortable coming here, and you will too!<//text>

<Text>Yesterday I went in looking for Mazda. They had the exact model and trim I was looking for! But when I got to their lot, I couldn't believe how many nice cars they had available. I believe they said they had over 200 cars on their lot. After looking around I found four SUVs that I wanted to test drive. I definitely made these guys work for the sale. Three of the cars were in the very back causing them to move everything in it's a way just so I could test drive it. Instead of being annoyed, like a normal person would be, they were very happy to move around the vehicles so I can test drive the exact one I wanted. Instead of the 2018 Mazda I had my eye on for weeks, I took home an Audi Q3 and I could not be happier! I couldn't believe that I found a luxury car in my price range. No where else would I be able to find an Audi, a BMW or Mercedes Benz in my price range (I test drove all 3). These guys are definitely a hidden gem! We are not from San Diego but I guarantee next time we need a car, we'll be driving all the way to San Diego just to buy from these guys. I worked with three gentleman: Chris, JR and Jose. All three of them were so amazing and happy to help with anything. This was not an ordinary car buying experience. It was fun! I'm so thankful we found these guys! I got an amazing deal on an amazing car and I didn't feel like I was cheated or ripped off. absolutely the best experience I've ever had at a dealership and it was all thanks to Chris, JR and Jose! You guys rock!!! I could definitely not recommend anyone better to buy a car from!< /Text><GmapID>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd<//GmapID>< pictures>

My wife and I have gotten 2 vehicles from them and each time they take their time to listen to what is the best option. Mike and Stan are very professional and genuinely care about you. We first got a Maxima with them 3 years ago but with rising gas prices and us wanting to start our family we went back to look for a bigger but more economical vehicle. I am very picky when it comes to shopping for a vehicle, Mike pulled out almost 10 different vehicles with no complaints just to make sure we were making the best pick. My wife and I noticed this and knew we were going to get taken care of. We ended up getting a Sorento and once again pleased with our purchase. Stan and Mike were able to make the numbers work to exactly to what we were looking for. Whenever anyone friends or family are looking for a vehicle we always tell them to look for either Mike or Stan, and for good reason too. We will always highly recommend coming here for your next vehicle.<//text>< Rating>

I just wanted to give a shoutout to Mike. He helped me throughout the entire process of my purchase of my Toyota Camry. He did his best to ensure that I had a pleasant experience and answered all of the questions that I had. There was an issue with the financial aspect and he looked into it to help me resolve the issue. Jorge, Stan were also helpful as well in helping me get the deal that I wanted. I would definitely recommend this dealership and Mike if you're looking to purchase a vehicle.</Review>

I would definitely recommend this dealership to everyone. However I have to say I was partial to tthe sales person I worked with, he was great. (Michael). He was very patient with me as I asked a lot of questions. He took all the time necessary to be sure I was happy. I would definitely do business with him again.</text>

Dmitry was very patient and knowledgeable. He made the deal a very easy experience. Would recommend this dealer very much.

Update.  Had an issue with my vehicle and took it in. Fortunately we had a warranty and the repairs were covered thru it. Very fast turn around and had my vehicle back and running. Very satisfied with the customer service.<//text>< pics>

Firstly, I would like to start this review off and give a shout out to Jose Martinez for being a very helpful, honest, and considerate car salesman. Jose is not the ordinary car salesman you would think of. Jose does not pressure you to purchase a vehicle, he does not feed you lies, and the only thing he truly cares about is listening to your interests, what you want, what fits your needs, and what needs to be done to satisfy your needs without lying to you and messing you over financially.

Secondly, Jose keeps in touch with you to see how things are going and he also remembers what your interests are in a vehicle while at the same time giving you options with the vehicles that the dealership has. I can assure you that if you want to look at cars freely, not lied to for the sake of a sale, but to be heard of what your needs are then Jose Martinez and Auto City Sales is the one you would want to visit.

Thirdly, I am a first time car buyer and I came in knowing of what car salesman try to do. I came in after I had done my research and quite honestly I did not encounter anything negative with Jose at all. He was honest and truthful and sincere all the way and even after the car sale is finished. Jose is a decent human being just like all of us trying to make a living but he does it in a positive and a non negative way.

Lastly, Jose made it a breeze for me to purchase a 2014 Ford Fiesta SE Hatchback with in house auto loans. Even being 18 and having new and establishing credit, he tried his very best that he can to get me the best rate. I would and always will recommend Auto City Sales in El Cajon with Jose working there to my friends or anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle.

Sincerely, Richard.

-Thanks Jose<//review>

<review>What an amazing experience!  Very special thank you to Alex!!!!  Just purchased a 2016 Acura MDX in absolutely perfect condition!  We did our homework and had been looking around for some time.  I have to say I was quite nervous about buying a used car not pre-certified from a dealership.  This place put all my fears to rest.  Alex was extremely patient with me, informative, and best of all honest.  I would recommend asking for him if you are in the market for a new (used) car.  They are a "no haggle" dealership, which means they are already priced super low (look around, you won't find better). Once the decision was made to purchase, things moved very quickly and efficiently.  I went in the morning to test drive and said I would return later with my husband.  There was no pressure at all to rush my decision (unlike the Honda dealership who followed me to my car wanting me to purchase immediately).  Alex held the car for me all day.  He made the process very easy.  We will be returning for the next car we buy!  THANK YOU ALEX!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd< /gmap_id></record>

I went into Auto City looking for a midsize truck capable of storing my ladder and work material, while still offering modern comfort. Our salesman Obed made sure my mother and I felt cared for, attended to, and was fully transparent with respects to the numbers involved in the financing process. I would gladly recommend Auto City to anyone and everyone.<//review>

This is my first time I write these reviews.We had a great experience at Auto City. Mike Monastyrski is a great salesman I ever met here.He was extremely pleasant and helpful.He even stayed late to help make sure I got into the best car within my price range and helped me with car insurance which I have never experienced before because it was my first car buying in USA.He answered my each question and concern in a professional manner.I gotta admit- this guy is a real pro!He didn’t make us feel we were buying a used car!The whole purchase process was quick,smooth and efficient.I would definitely recommend Auto City to anyone!!!</Review>

RECENTLY MY HUSBAND AND I FILED OUR 2ND BANKRUPTCY AND DID NOT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN AN AUTO LOAN WHILE IN A CHAPTER 13 -OPEN BK. STAN OVER AT AUTO CITY WORKED WONDERS HE WALKED US THROUGH EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS AND GOT US APPROVED AND THE ROAD TO REBUILDING CREDIT. LESS THAN 1K DOWN AND A NICE CAR LOW MILEAGE UNLIKE OTHER PLACES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE AND TRY TO GIVE YOU BEAT UP OLD CARS . I WOULD RECOMMEND AUTO CITY TO ANYONE GOOD CARS AND THEY THEY KNOW HOW TO GET YOU APPROVED. THANK YOU AUTO CITY ESPECIALLY STAN<//review>

Worked with Obed and he was AMAZING! No pressure when choosing the car we wanted and was there with open ears in regards to "wants." This is the best car buying experience we have had!< /Review>

<text>The entire team is amazing. I reached out via the website, got a call right away, scheduled an appointment and go my car the following day. Each team member did a great job at every step of the way so that I could get the best car within my budget. They even watched my kid and helped move my stuff to the new car.  Thanks to Nellie, Stan, Ramil, Den, Michele and a couple of other employees who gave a hand where needed. I am impressed and will refer everyone to AutoCity.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

The car lot has a lot of great cars for reasonable prices. I really enjoyed that. Mike helped me, wasn’t overly pushy etc, and helped me find the best car for my budget.

There are a few things that are questionable, but nothing to do with Mike. I would recommend him and this company, and I have.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>5+ stars!  After combing thru countless ads for weeks, I was depressed over how few of the many used cars for sale out there are worth a second look.  Then I ran across an ad from AutoCity.  The car was within the year and price I range I was looking for. The price, in fact, was on the lower side of the KBB suggested range.  I called and spoke to Alex.

Satisfied with what I had read in the CarFax provided in their ad, I told Alex what I wanted from him was his assessment of the condition of the car.  Alex asked me to hold on.   He would rate it a 9, he said, when he came back on the line.  Sure!  I thought, how many used cars rate a 9?!

However, when my son and I went to see it, we were truly surprised to find that Alex had not exaggerated.  This was not an auction or multi-owner vehicle, it was a remarkably well taken care of one-owner car.  Only when we actually saw the car did we realize that what I had assumed to be Toyota stock photos in the ad, in fact, were the actual photos of this car!  No smoke-and-mirrors!

Throughout our inspecting the car, Alex was helpful but not once pressured us, just patiently answered questions and gave us space, even when I decided I wanted to think about it overnight.

We bought the car the next morning. The finance person was efficient and knowledgeable.  We were offered a warranty and other options - although we declined each of these, not once were we pressured to purchase any of them!!

The following day, I had a mechanic from Autodocs do a thorough examination of the car.  After two hours of inspecting it: inside, outside, underneath, etc., the mechanic found just two items:  a rear seat belt that would not latch and scratched rims (Alex had already scheduled for those to be to be taken care of).  Everything else, the mechanic’s written 2 ½ page report states, is in excellent condition.

The AutoCity staff treated us in a most professional, courteous manner and made this important purchase a very pleasant experience.   We were, in fact, so impressed with the quality of the cars on their lot and the courteous, no-pressure treatment - as our family replaces cars, we definitely plan to contact Alex again!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Learned about this through USAA and I highly recommend it if you are looking for new or used cars.  Customer service is excellent.  A minute after I click availability I got a call from Nelly and she is very helpful and accommodating and we are able to see the cars in just 30 mins.  When we get to Auto City Chris Samuels approach us and offered assistance right away.  Although we are not able to look at the car right away because the person that was scheduled look at it before us is processing to buy it the Manager Fareez came to us and got my phone # and my husbands and promise to give us a call if and if not the couple before us purchase the car.  The next day Fareez called us and let us know that the car is back in the financing didnt went through with the first couple and if we want it its ours.  And as expected  Chris was already waiting for us and help us with everything.  The car is in excellent condition, carfax and warranty was explained and we just feel like we are valued customer.  Highly recommended, great service and excellent vehicles they have here.  Will be back for our son's first car for sure.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

We visited 10 dealerships over the course of a week. All of them were aggressive, insistent, and demanding, but when we came to auto city we found it to be a very relaxed environment. They allowed us to drive off the lot with the car we wanted (Toyota Sierra) without a representative and had the option to keep it three days to take it for a private inspection.
Mike was our representative and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience. He was understanding of our needs, approachable, and relatable. He discussed everything in detail and answered all of our questions. If you go to auto city definitely ask for Mike.</text>

Mr Obed is such a pleasant no pressure salesman, which meant the world to me. When I found the car I wanted, he happily showed me the Carfax. He also explained how the financing work which was a huge plus. I researched this dealership and their cars for a couple of weeks and I felt right at home when Mr Obed greeted me in the car lot with his warm smile and great attitude!</review>

Franck & Alex were great. Couldn't have asked for a better car buying experience. My only complaint/reason for 4 starts was the finance guy was a little pushy about the protection options.< /text>

From the moment I walked thru the door I was given not only 100% undivided attention but the red carpet treatment as well.  These gentlemen went above and beyond to make sure that my car buying experience was as short, sweet, and pleasant as possible!  I enjoyed how I moved from one department to the next as they kept me well informed about what to expect.
Usually, I have a hard time going out to look at cars but this time I actually enjoyed it.  So if you have these type of anxieties the perfect regiment is a little Stan, with a lot of Chris, and topped of with Ramil.  Hey you guys were exceptional!  Thank you.<//Text>

I highly reccomend this place. The husband and I are in a financial hardship. My credit has taken a toll from it and my husband has not established credit. Team kia of El cajon rejected us the same day that AUTO CITY let us leave the lot with a car! Everyone was very friendly, did a great job at going out of their way for us. We dealt with Chris and Ramil directly and are very appreciative!<//Review>

Auto City is awesome! From the time we walked in to check out a Toyota Tacoma, no pressure, no attitude, very courteous and respectful. I purchased my truck and the next day my brakes started to vibrate. I brought it back and the Maintenance Manager treated me like a King! He had his mechanics replace front brake rotors and pads with new ones and new drums for the rears. All done while I waited in the lobby, I was amazed. He also was very nice and very apologetic. The truck has been awesome since and I'm a satisfied customer. Blessings for the "Auto City Team"
Thank you!

Alfred was the best salesman ever! He worked with me and I have no credit score at all. I would recommend him highly. Come buy your car from auto city of el cajon.  Ask for Alfred... You'll be happy you did.</text>

<review>I had a great experience buying my car at Auto City. Mike Manastyrski my salesman was awesome to deal with, and worked hard to get me a great deal! I HIGHLY recommend buying your next vehicle there, they are very professional, and do a great job of working with everyone to get a good deal. Take advantage of their extended warranties, because they offer a excellent protection package like no other.</review>< pics>

I was in the market for a new car, maybe two. I had tried a couple other dealers including some large dealers and did not have the best experience. Of course they were trying to upsell me and push whatever they wanted to sell. Finally I went to Auto City. I wish this had been my first stop. At no point did I feel like I was wasting my time or they were just trying to sell a car. Jose helped me out, there was no pressure and I was able to trade in my truck and drive off with two cars in just a few hours. I can honestly say I've never had such a good car browsing or buying experience. The cars we got look great and drove even better. The no pressure sales and hospitality at Auto City are unbeatable. I highly recommend Auto City to anyone in the market who knows exactly what they want. They do not try to do what they want, they are genuinely there to help you get the car you want and need. Two thumbs up!</text>

<text>As a first time car buyer, I had heard all the horror stories about buying a car (and experienced a fair bit of frustration myself at other dealers) before coming to Auto City. Not only was the experience pressure free and easy, but it was actually ENJOYABLE! JR and Auto City actually managed to bring the joy back into making this big first purchase for me, something that had been shrinking with each dealer I interacted with before I came to Auto City. JR brought out 8 cars for me to test drive, was honest about any potential issues for each one, and treated me with respect. His friendly and helpful service made the experience of buying my first car a good one (and the price was also a plus!) If you're looking to buy a used car, I HIGHLY recommend checking out Auto City.</text>< name>

In the beginning, I loved this place!  Everyone was so nice, and we found a nice  car that they said had no problems, and the paperwork said so! The salesman was awesome and really took his time with us. Well, 4 months later and lots of repair costs, I am not such a fan anymore.  They have nice looking cars, but be really careful and get the car totally checked out before buying it!  They will not admit to anything even though they may know about a problem existing. (First hand experience here!) They will temporarily "fix" a problem, and you won't know until you are stuck with the repair costs which, of course, they won't help with unless you bring it to their repair shop that "fixed" it in the first place. The customer service is great until the car is yours!  Beware!<//Text>

Jose Martinez and the Auto City Sales team were both helpful and personable. Their hospitality was noted from the beginning and they were more than willing to work with my wants versus selling me a newer or more expensive selection. They were more than happy to provide me additional features I asked for and followed up to ensure I was happy with my purchase. I would recommend these guys to anyone!< /Review>

<Text>Ended up not liking the car I went in for originally, but another one quickly caught my eye. They managed to get me approved for the vehicle even though it was a little more expensive. J.R. was there with great customer service the entire time. He responded to phone calls, texts, and went the full nine yards. Even after, I noticed one of the speakers had a buzzing sound. They offered to replace it and didn't forget about me once the deal was done.</Text>< Time>

My experience at AutoCity was great! I went in knowing what I wanted and told Mike just what I wanted and he worked his magic and got me in the car that I wanted with a good price. Mike was very easy to work with and made my experience a smooth one. I have a great car now and feel confident with my decision to work with AutoCity.

First off I spoke with both “supervisors”
We had an agreement and even spoke money terms regarding a car.
I was going to drive 2+ hours to buy a car.
They assured me they’d have the car ready for me on a Friday.
I double checked with both FRANK and SAUL, the supposedly supervisors, that there wouldn't be a problem holding the car.
I get a call a night before im supposed to pick up the car telling me they sold it.
What kind of business is that?

<Text>Very happy!

My fiancé and I came in to look for a car for her and we were pleasantly surprised with the positive, clear, concise and fluid assistance we received from Alfred here at Auto City in El Cajon!!! Alfred is calm, cool and collected, very knowledgeable and he was able to quickly answer our questions, listen to our wants and needs and get us into a vehicle that fit into our budget.

My fiancé is so excited with her car, it’s the one she was looking to drive away in!!! They helped her collect all of her info so she could get the paperwork done and it was a great environment to make it all happen. No pressure, no shenanigans, just straight-forward listening and providing value and service.

We got to test drive the car by ourselves which was new to us and kind of nice. They have a great selection of cars and they were in great shape. Everyone was professional, clean and very positive!!

If I am in the market for a car anytime soon I will come back over here to these guys and definitely work directly with Alfred. I highly recommend him to anyone and everyone, tell them Taylor or Christina sent you!!!</Text>< pictures>

This was the second vehicle I have purchased from Auto City Sales. I am always pleased with the professionalism of the staff and how fast and friendly they are. Special thanks to Stan, he's the most easy going sales executive that I ever dealt with. I felt like I was doing business with friends. Keep up the good work guys. Regards, Roman.</review>

Bought a car with them, was not coerced to buy anything, found the car online I wanted and it was the best price compared to all the dealerships around. I even had the 3 day grace period to return the car if I did not like it.< /Text>

<name>cherie tedde<//name><Date>1435110357045</Date><rate>5</rate><text>My experience took place on April 4th 2015 where I meet Victor Gonzalez our salesmen.  Prior to coming to Auto City I was turned down left and right for a loan due to my credit history.  However I really needed a running car in order to go to work. Since I was unable to afford something brand new I started to shop around for something used and affordable.  I met Victor who new my desperate situation and he really helped me to find a car that I not only could afford but was able to get financed.  I was just planning on having to buy something out right but couldn't find anything within my budget.  Victor and his team really worked hard in making sure I could get financed. Most places would turn me away at first site of my credit.  Victor really didn't make me feel rushed and he certainly wasn't the typical pushy salesmen.  Victor went over all the information with me very carefully and making sure I understood the terms and agreement and offered additional coverage on the car for small price.  My boyfriend is thinking of buying a new truck and this is the place we will be buying it from. I highly recommend Auto City<//text>< pics>

My 82 year old mother had been driving the same truck for the last 23 years. She had never driven a vehicle with power steering, power brakes, power anything. She was totally unfamiliar with all recent features in newer vehicles. Jose was very patient in explaining how the features work and made sure all our questions were answered about the car we were looking at. He explained the fixed, no haggle pricing the dealership uses, and made sure that all the taxes and fees were as low as possible. The buying process was simple and painless. I would definitely recommend Jose to anybody interested in buying a car.</Review>

I am shocked at how nice of an experience buying a car from here was. Un-accompanied test drives with no time limit, allowed us to take our time scrutinizing the interior, exterior, and under the hood on all vehicles, and zero pressure sales tactics for the most part. They were still a bit pushy with the recommended service plan, but this is understandable in that the business has a bottom line to meet. The price at which they sold me my new Jeep was at or below what everyone else was offering, and the car is in excellent condition. I highly recommend you stop by here if for no other reason than to research rides you might like. Talk to JR, he's the dude.< /review>

Nice selection of cars that are in GREAT shape. Nice customer service I would say. 2nd year in a row coming here and I still wasn't able to get financed without shelling out a load of money... BUMMER!!! Would have liked to purchase but I don't believe a 3rd times a charm taking my business elsewhere :(</review>

<Review>Absolutely terrible. I bought a car at auto city and two days later it wouldn’t start.. I took it into auto city the next day to fill out some paperwork and when I tried to leave, it wouldn’t start up again so I refunded the car.. The lights were also out.. and I’m so happy I’m not stuck in a 6 year contract with that car. They also charged me 18% interest which is absolutely ridiculous. They were very rude when I decided i didn’t want the car anymore.. never going back.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< date>

If you need a car, go see Obid at Auto city. Very professional and knowledgeable. He will work hard to get you a vehicle that meets your needs within your budget. You don’t feel rushed or obligated to buy. I would definitely recommend going to auto city, Obid specifically for your car needs.</Text>

<review>I had a very good experience at Auto City. My last 3 cars were bought from private owners, so this was my first experience buying and financing through a dealership. I called ahead of time to ask questions and Victor was very helpful and answered my questions over the phone and also kept in contact with me via email before I could come see the car I was interested in. When I arrived, everyone was very friendly and accommodating. After I test drove the vehicle and discussing my options, I left the dealership to think about it and also check out a couple of other cars at different places. But after what I saw and experienced, I felt I was making the right decision by deciding to give Auto City my business. I will say that I was surprised that there was no negotiating on the price of the vehicle, but Victor explained their policy and according to my research, I can say that I feel I got a fair deal and one of the best deals I could find for the vehicle I wanted. When I decided to purchase the car, it was an extremely quick and easy process. I'd say I was there an hour tops handling paperwork and finalizing the purchase. Since purchasing my car a week ago, I have contacted Victor a couple of times with further questions and he is always extremely helpful and willing to take time to assist me and get back to me quickly. I'm very happy with my experience there and would definitely recommend Auto City to anyone looking for a pre-owned car.</review>< rating>

<Review>A very nice place to go to if your shopping around for cars. I was amazed on how they let you test drive their vehicle on your own, and without any specific time limit (unlike those big dealerships). The guy that I talked to, Jose, was a very professional and friendly guy. He is straight to the point, and will even try to help you out get a better deal. All in all, I had a very wonderful experience with the dealership and they even let me drive the car home without giving them my bank's draft yet. I would highly recommend this place ti my friends and relatives. That 100 mile trip that I drove yesterday was definitely worth it (Definitely loving the sonic that I bought!!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I went in today to help my son in law find a car. I was looking around and noticed a car I would like. I didn’t plan on buying a car, but I mentioned to our sales advisor Obed that I liked a Ford Fusion they had. He went in to offering me a great deal on that car and traded in my own car. In a matter of minutes he set up a contract for me and I went home with a new car! Usually buying a car takes a long time and seems like a drag, but Obed managed to give everything I needed, fast, and treated me like a valued customer. It has never been that easy! Only at Auto City!< /text>

Im a first time car purchaser who is put off by salesmen. For this reason I have been terrified of the process. I knew what I wanted and I knew my financial situation. When I walked in and told Obed what I wanted he listened. He didn’t try to tell me I wanted something else just because he could see my credit score. He let me decide! And even though I went in for a Highlander I was sold on a Rogue. The truth is that the Rogue is what I was originally looking for but didn’t tell Obed that... but I didn’t have too!! The best blessing, highly recommend best customer service!!< /text>

<user>118246784223411395124< /user><Resp>None<//Resp><text>This review pertains to my experience once I arrived at the dealer.

Despite being pre-approved, having my vehicle already selected and having already test drove the car, I was at the dealership for 3+ hours.  The process should have been much faster but they were very disorganized.

In addition, I was misquoted on price.  My rep sat down with me and showed me a price of 25,350 for the vehicle I selected but he had confused it with another vehicle.  The actual price was 25,400 which isn’t a lot but it ended up changing my loan rate by over 1.5%.  When I pointed this out they just shrugged their shoulders and said there was nothing they could do.

When I finally got the vehicle, I was only given 1 key and the driver side door mat was missing.  Those things should really be explained prior to purchasing the vehicle as they will cost me hundreds of dollars to replace.

Although they did have good prices, I feel that the buying experience was very poor and misleading.</text>< gmap_id>

I went into auto city not knowing what to expect I knew what car I wanted but that was all, as soon as I walked into the building I was greated by Denis and from there it was history. He got me into the exact car I wanted, he worked with me and I felt very pleased when I left, he was very courteous and kind and I felt welcomed. I've never written a review before but Denis left a great impression with me so I had to share, I will definitely be returning the next time I'm looking for a car.</Review>

< review>
They are absolute crooks.  When I got there I traded in my 2012 Hyundai Sonata and put $3000 cash down on a 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe with 32,000 miles on it. I informed them Im starting a new life up in Davis Ca and they were so nice and made the transaction so easy.  Well, after about a week I start getting calls from them, and more calls and more calls of them wanting me to send them copies of my paychecks and so I did.  That wasnt good enough then they start telling me I lied about my income and the harrassing calls kept coming.  At work, spending time with my son that I havent seen in a year etc etc.  Then they send me awhole new contract throughFed Ex and everyone told me not to sign so I didnt.  Then the calls continued and would not stop.  So they send me another contract and Isaac is telling me this deal is better than before that my payments will be lower and my first payment wont be due for an extra month, well after reviewing the new contract it stated my payments would be higher.  I signed it anyway because  I just wanted them to stop harrassing me at my job and basically blowing my phone up threatening me that they will have a tow truck come get the car if those docs were not signed.  And Issac told me I had until 4:00 that day to sign or a tow truck was coming to get my car.  I am over 500 miles away from the dealership. And told them to just take this car and return my money and my car because I cannot afford to drive all the way back to San Diego to pick up my other car and my job wont give me the time off.  I signed the docs and sent them in by 4.  Then I get a certified letter from them stating I have until the 6th of July to return the car or they will take it at my expense.  Bill collectors started calling me about my trade in saying my car payment is over 45 days late.  I have NEVER been late on any of my car payments.  They never paid the car off, nor did they even contact the finance company of my other car and now this has gone on my credit.  I am a single mom trying to start a new life and now wont even be able to get a place because my credit is ruined.  These people are evil and they took full advantage of a single mom in a desperate situation.  I make more than enough money and my credit was good.  They havent even given me the opportunity to make my first car payment of $430.  Which is rediculous but it is something I can afford.  Im getting an attorney and suing them.  This has been nothing but a nightmare.</review>

<rating>5</rating><review>We saw the car we want from their professionally designed website, went there to purchase the car, then we sign the papers. They never attempt to distract us with other cars they are selling. They fully supported the one we choose. It was the best car buying experience so far. Especially Alfred, he has so much patience with my daughter's million questions marathon. The car we chose is in very good condition despite it being a 2012 model. Definitely will recommend AutoCity to everyone we know.</review>< Pics>

This dealer truly is one that shines when it comes to customer service. They truly take their time to understand a persons needs. They will go to bat for you with the banks to get it done. They are a solid dealership to work with.

My family was in the market for a new family vehicle.  We didnt like what we went there to see but, Tim, gentle and persistent showed us some more vehicles.  His patience and understanding of our needs and wants helped us find our new family car.  This place is clean and professional.  Salesmen are knowledgable and courteous.  Thank You for the excellent and painless experience finding what we needed.<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>This is my second car in auto city. Great customer service, no pressure to buy a car. They allow you to drive the car without them supervising you, you can even take the cars to the freeway. They give you your space to take your time, If you need to speak in private, they are not chasing you or trying to persuading you to buy something. If you like something, they give you all the details, and if your change your mind, they understand that. I bough a GLK 2010 and Kia Soul 2016, and both are great cars, I bough the first one 5 months ago and not issues at all. I found an air hose tear down, and they changed with not extra cost. They also offer insurance for your cars for transmissions, engines, or bumper to bumper. They are so confident about their car that all cars have 6,000 or 6 months of guaranteed. You can not beat that.< /Review></record>

I had an amazing experience at Auto City. Everyone that I encountered was so very helpful and welcoming. JR explained gratefully everything to me and was very personable. I hear of so many people that have horrible experiences with car dealerships. This was my first time buying a car from a dealership and I will definetly reccommend to anyone looking for a vehicle in this area. I was comfortable that I was given the best option for me and ver happy that I was taken care of.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>My husband and I were in the market for a used car this past winter. We were driving around dealerships in East County and drove past Auto City. We were impressed by the strong reviews on Google and Yelp, so we stopped in.

We were introduced to Alfred and we shared the characteristics we were looking for in a car. He explained to us that the car specifications are primarily online (vs. posted on vehicles in the lot), and essentially handed over his computer for us to view the inventory online. He didn't hover or pressure us - which we really appreciated. We found a car we liked and asked to test drive. We got the keys and were told to be back in an hour. We LOVED the car, but it was two days before Christmas and we were nervous about the timing. We were considering getting the car checked out by a mechanic before purchasing, so we were concerned about buying right before the holidays. Alfred showed us how to put a hold on the vehicle, so we were able to come back on the 26th.

When we arrived on the 26th, we were greeted with excellent customer service once again. We were provided with the keys to get the car checked out by a mechanic. There were no issues with the vehicle. We financed the car with SDCCU (because the rates were a bit better) and we did not get pressured by Auto City to change our decision.

When we returned to Auto City to purchase the car and finalize the paperwork, everyone was extremely friendly and efficient. The whole process only took a couple of hours and was nearly stress-free - we haven't been able to say that about any other car buying experience.

As an extra bonus, we noticed the car didn't have floor mats. Alfred told us to stay in touch with him and to reach out if we saw a similar car on the website in the inventory moving forward. We did, reached out to Albert, and he gave us the floor mats of that similar vehicle without charge.

We love our new car and had a great experience. Overall, I highly recommend considering Auto City if you're in the market for a used vehicle!< /text>< Pics>

<review>I have had car sales phobia due to past experiences, so after doing some research I decided to give Auto City a try.  Jose Martinez answered the phone and right from the beginning made me feel real comfortable with his “no pressure” attitude.
My transaction was not an easy one but Jose got us qualified, and today, success!  I am driving an incredible car that shows to be under KBB price, with more great features we keep on finding still after the purchase.  We could not be any happier! We are already planning our next purchase with him.<//review>< gmapID>

<Review>I am not a having funs to write reviews, its boring process, but I will spend some time and will write for AutoCity. But I do read reviews before I go to new places. I also was reading reviews here. Most of reviews here are super amazing. Some of them are negative, and I am sure most of those negative reviews are coming from the people who didn't get what they wanted, but I guess any place will have haters so here is my review for AutoCity.
This place is real like a City, but City of the cars. They have a giant amount of cars there for any budget, some cars are still brand new with only few miles on it. I am shocked how they get all those cars. And their team is amazing, Ramil, Alex, Fareez and other guys will do everything to make sure you get a vehicle with no hassle and without any dirty games like at any traditional dealerships. So impressed and amazed. Let's go AutoCity. Oh by the way their coffee machine is another story, this machine is the best of the best, Starbucks compared to this machine is NOTHING. I can't even say how many exactly  varieties that coffee machine has. Probably at least 20: latte, mocha, decaf, regular coffee, expresso, cappuccino, French vanilla cappuccino, hot chocolate... You name it...
Oh and they even have their own fully equipped Service department... How they fit al this in that small building?  Staff is very friendly there. I would highly recommend AutoCity to everyone.<//Review></record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Tim was great and really worked with us within our low budget of $5000.  We stayed in touch for a few weeks, pre-sale, and my mom finally got a car that she is really happy with.  Tim has followed up with me after we purchased the car to ensure that my mom is still happy... and she is!  The guys at Auto City Sales are professional, and we were not pressured into upgrading or buying something we didn't want.  There were also a few nit-picky things on the car that we wanted taken care of.  Tim took care of everything we asked for before we picked up the car.  This was actually a pleasant experience!

Just purchased my 2nd car from Auto City last week.  Again, great experience all around.  Very trustworthy.  I needed something reliable for my teenage daughter and we found something immediately.  I love the 6 month free warranty!  Thank you to Mike and Obed!  Auto City is the first place I think of when someone starts looking for a car.  I recommend this place to all!!</text><gmap_id>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd< /gmap_id>< pictures>

This is why we target far achieving the low bar of expectations others have set which works as a tremendous advantage for everyone that does business with us. Our desire is that Auto City Sales be thought of in a highly positive light and the only way to make that happen is to treat everyone in such a way that they provide awesome feedback like you have here today.

I had a great experience at Autocity. The car I wanted to purchase was waiting for me  in the front when I arrived. Demitri showed me the car and took it on a test drive. The car is clean and in great condition. The one who worked his magic was Obed. We sat down and he brought down my monthly payments and lowered my interest rate. Definitely would recommend coming here if your looking to purchase your next car.< /text>

<review>It was my first experience with dealers and I'm glad Auto City guys are not like other typical dealers.
They offer best competitive price.
Manager Ramil is very courteous and honest, and helped me out to complete all paper work patiently.
I would definitely recommend my friends to first visit this dealer before checking others.< /review>< Pictures>

I contacted Auto City on a Sunday afternoon online and within a few hours was contacted by a woman that reviewed my information and made an appt for me to come down the next day. She then called back in the morning to say they were looking forward to meeting me and clarified a few things I should bring. I came for my appt and within three hours I had a new car. I am impressed with how professional everyone was. The entire process went smoothly and I wasn't nervous or anxious. The price I paid was below Kelley Blue Book for my car! I got the payment I wanted and was also counseled a bit on how best to raise my credit score using my new car loan. A member of the team gave me a guide to buying a used car and even offered to come out to teach a class for the high schooler's in my area on how to buy a car and what credit is and how to get and keep good credit. I had a small issue with my car (not mechanical, piece of plastic wheel well) and I brought it back in a week later. The small issue was handled immediately and to my full satisfaction. I will definitely be coming back here for my next car. I recommend Auto City to anyone that want's the ultimate car buying experience.<//text>

Auto City made buying a car so simple! They even sent me an Uber from work when I told them my car wouldn’t start. Thank You Stan, Mike & Alfredo!< /Review>

My wife and I were looking for a used car several months ago.  We stopped at Kia of El Cajon to check out a lease special they had and left feeling the particular icky feeling you have after you leave most car dealerships.  On our way out, we saw the sign for Auto City, which is just down the street, and decided to go there.

We were not immediately rushed upon by a gaggle of sales people, like most dealerships.  Instead, we were greeted by Alfred.  He explained to us that the easiest way to look through their inventory was to look through their website at a computer in their office.  We went in and told him what we were looking for and he pulled up a list of all the vehicles that matched our criteria.  There were no attempts to up-sell us to a more expensive vehicle.  He was also realistic and up front about what financing options we had and what our monthly payments would be.

After he filtered their inventory to match our criteria, he left us at his desk to look through what was available.  Occasionally, he would stop in to see if we had questions.  Once we chose the vehicle we were interested in, we let him know and he got it out for us to test drive.

By the time we were done test driving, it was late and we wanted to think about the car before buying it so Alfred let us know we could put a hold on the car for a couple of days, which we ended up doing.

We came back two days later to test drive again, as well as take the car to a mechanic to be inspected.  Upon a good report from the mechanic, we decided to buy.  We let Alfred know and he got the process rolling with paperwork, signatures, etc.  We went to our own bank for financing and it was a pretty smooth process.

All in all, we were able to test drive and purchase a car within the the span of a couple of hours.  The was very little pressure.  In fact, the only upsell attempt came at the financing desk where they tried to offer us additional warranties, paint coating, and other classic car dealership add-ons.  Once the pitch was over, we said no and they moved on.  It was nice and simple.

I would definitely recommend checking out Auto City for used cars.  The people were friendly and low pressure.  There's no negotiating for prices (prices are comparatively low already).  And they have a 6 month warranty that's included, which is nice.  If you're looking for a car, check them out!<//review>

I worked with Dmitry recently on buying a new car. He helped me take home a 2016 Toyota highlander and I love it. Dmitry was very helpful as is all of the staff at Auto City. I know they worked very hard to get me financed and I am very grateful. I would recommend this dealership and Dmitry to family and friends.< /Review>

I have only had one small issue with a car I bought and I can tell you, They stand behind their warranties and always strive to make things right! They will even service your car after the warranty period is over and they are much cheaper than most auto repair places and you can trust that is till be done right!< /review>< Pics>

Purchased a car from them and enjoy it, but they seem to forget about you once all sales have been made.
I have been trying to schedule a maintenance apt for about 3 weeks now... and they have no gotten back to me , returned my messages or phone calls. Very Frustrating</review>

I bought my car here in 2012, a Lexus es300 with 110,000miles on it. This was the first place I went to that the staff was not pushy. My buddy and I were able to take out several cars for test drives without a problem. This car with little maintenance has stood the test of time and made the cross country trek when I moved from Cali to the East coast.< /text>

Had a pleasant visit, was attended by both Dmitry and Mike. They where both very helpful and friendly in attending us. Dmitry reserved the vehicle for us and explained in detail how everything in the vehicle works and all its compartments. Mike took care of us with the paperwork, explained everything in the carfax, the warranty and final pricing with detail. Mike made sure we were well attended and was always offering us a beverage to make sure we felt welcomed. Would definitely come back to work with them for any future vehicle purchases.</text>

Dymitri was a please to work with. He knew about the RX300 Lexus and showed me all features. Let me drive it by myself for 20 minutes. The 3 day money back guarantee was the reason I went there in the first place. Nothing to hide. Car had work done which they were very thourogh on explaining what was done to get it ready to sell.  I was disappointed that they used old pictures in ad showing mats and privacy cover. Dymitri checked with the detail dept as well as around the office but no mats. Not his fault. I blame the dealer using the old pics of the first time they sold the car. Looks like that person kept them.  Also disappointed they advertised financing then told me the car was too old to finance.  Ended up being a cash deal. Brightest spot was Dimitri. He did a good job.  I would buy from them again.</text>

Auto City is the perfect place to buy a car. From lots of vehicle options, to great customer service. Ask for Ramil, he is very professional and will help you with anything you need. I am a first time buyer and I got aproved thanks to him, low and reasonable monthly payments. Stop by and find out by yourself. Amazing!<//review>

<Text>My review is to give a big "thank you" to the employees at Auto City who helped my husband out this past Sunday, when none of the other nearby dealerships would. My husband was on his way home in a used SUV we had just purchased in the Serra Mesa area, when he noticed it was running out of gas. Luckily he was on I-8 East and was able to take the Johnson Ave exit, make it off exit and pull over off the street, right across from the KIA dealership on Johnson. Jim thought that the KIA dealership might be able to help him out  with a little gas, which he was willing to pay for of course, to get to a gas station.  Well, they said, "no, can't help you" and were rude and patronizing about it, so Jim tried couple of others, same response. Auto City was the last dealership in Jim's vicinity and they were willing to help him out. They gave him a gas can with a little gas so he could get to closest station and just asked that he bring back enough gas to cover what they gave him, which he did. So thank you to the guys at Auto City for showing some charity and helping my husband out when he asked for help. You guys are awesome!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>First time buying a used car. Very wide selection of used cars. Found a car that I liked, but the hood had a dent on it. Didn't matter because they were able to get it fixed at no cost before I picked up the car. Ayrat and Ramil were super patient and helpful throughout the whole process explaining and walking me through all of it.< /Review>< Pics>

This is the time I wish I could give more than 5 stars because my experience at  Auto City has by far been the BEST EXPERIENCE EVER and this is due to Stan, Mike, and Ramil! I started speaking to Stan over the phone and of course I was indecisive as to which vehicle i wanted, but Stan took the time to send me some vehicles to start off with! Of course, I didn’t like them! So, I waited a couple days and restarted my quest to purchase this vehicle. I didn’t want to be in the dealership for a long time, so I started my credit app online and in the comments entered Stan’s name so i wouldn’t be bombarded with other calls. Within a couple of days Stan had my financing secured and it was up to me to figure what vehicle I wanted to purchase. And the reason it took a couple of days for financing is due to my credit not being the best because I was off of work for a year battling for my health! With that comes a huge reduction in pay along with a decrease in that FICO score, but Stan made it happen!!!
I walked in to finalize the deal and Mike(Stan’s right hand Man) met me with the keys to test drive a vehicle I was leaning towards. Mike was so attentive towards my feelings and I’ve never seen anyone a dealership pay attention to my emotions. I’m not sure what look I gave off when I test drove the vehicle, but Mike was able to know it was not the one! He knew I wasn’t happy with the vehicle and Mike made it his quest to make sure I was happy! By the time I came back from the test drive, Mike had the key to another vehicle for me to look at and test drive! It was the ONE!! As soon as I sat in the vehicle I melted in the seats, looked at Mike and told him this is it! This is the one, i didn’t  need to test drive it, This is it!! And that is the vehicle I drove home in! I absolutely LOVE my new vehicle and it didn’t break the bank either!
After confirming my vehicle Stan, Mike, and Ramil made sure I was out of the dealership within an hour; which included cleaning and filling that gas tank up!! I’ve NEVER IN MY LIFE SPENT LESS THAN 2 HRs in a dealership ever! I didn’t feel any pressure, I didn’t feel any uneasiness and I will forever purchase future vehicles from Auto City because they make it personalized to fit you!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart Stan and Mike you truly made this purchase painless!!< /text>

<Text>I recently purchased a 2013 Nissan Leaf from Auto City Sales.  I had researched the Leaf for sometime and after extensive searching, internet and otherwise, found the prices at Auto City, along with their 3 month warranty, to be the best deal in San Diego.  Their prices are significantly below local dealerships and they provided me with the Car Fax report of the car I was interested in and ultimately ended up purchasing.  In addition, their financing company provided me with an interest rate lower than what San Diego County Credit Union was able to offer.  Tim was honest and no-pressure and we were able to conduct the transaction smoothly and quickly.  Auto City fully honored their warranty when, on a fluke shortly after purchase, the car's heater failed.  They actually came and picked it up, fixed it, and delivered it back to me.  I have since had the car independently checked out by Pacific Nissan and it has been confirmed to be in great shape.  The battery - which is the most important element of EVs - is at 100% capacity and there are no issues with the mechanics or title.  Next time I am in the market, I will be going back to Auto City.<//Text>< user_id>

I heard about this place before but I forgot about it and bought one of my cars at another place. What a mistake! I got nothing but problems with the car and no help whatsoever. Auto City was different and came forward to help in my situation. I got second car in great condition and with warranty. Very flexible service. I strongly recommend to check this place out when buying a used car.<//Review>

<Text>They only have five stars as an option. SIX Stars for Dmitry!!.. who took great care of us and made the auto buying process smooth and fun.  On that note, the entire AutoCity staff was excellent. Prices are fair as any but be ready to be stacked with insurances and securities you didn’t ask for at a higher charge of course. Lol.. it’s all good tho because ALL dealerships do that. Either way.. great overall experience!<//Text>< Name>

I just bought my first car ever! Let me just say Mike was awesome, very kind and went above amd beyond. Jose was so nice and has managed a great team of workers. Jose also went above and beyond to make sure I walked out with a good car so I can get to work and get around with my 18mth son. Words can't express how grateful I am. Thank you<//review>

We worked with Mike to buy our 2015 Chevy Traverse. He was extremely helpful & patient through the process (we brought outle toddler for the whole deal). It’s obvious Autocity truly cares that their customers have a great experience. They aren’t looking for a quick sale, they are wanting to create long term relationships. We will come to Autocity first next time we are in the market to buy.< /Text>

This place sold us a bad car!  Beware. Issue didn't surface until months later. Noticed this rattling noise.

Even though the car fax indicated no reported issues, 2 replicable mechanics both stated that the transmission had been touched and likely not put back together properly. And for the mileage on the car,  cannot explain why the transmission had been touched in this Toyota Matrix.

So here it is, 7 months later we are left with a huge out-of-pocket expense of over $1,000.00 to fix the transmission issue in this Toyota Matrix.  Purchased the vehicle service contract from Auto City Sales also, but of course, this issue isn't covered under it.  Double whammy!!  What a rip-off!

Since we didn't perform our due diligence and bring the car to our own mechanic for a thorough inspection right after the purchase, we'd be willing to go 50/50 on the repair cost.  But of course, Auto City says there is nothing they can do.  It's all our problem now.

No customer service satisfaction offered.  Maybe this transmission issue was an oversight on their part but then maybe not and they knew about it.  You start to wonder who tampered with the transmission? Absolutely wasn't us.  Bottom line is we will never buy another used car from here.   And will not recommend this place to family and friends.</text>

<review>I came in on a Saturday, which happened to be the 1st year of my parents death thinking that I would just look around in hopes of trading in my car a month or so down the line. Little did I know that I'd be walking away with a vehicle that I WANTED for the first time in my life. I started to walk the lot with my girlfriend, (who by the way told me of the spot after purchasing her 2014 Lexus from Autocity) and I saw this 2015 Infiniti Q40. Believe it or not I saw it online prior to coming inside the lot, thinking I had no chance of even qualifying for this car at a reasonable price. Before I could walk any further a young gentlemen by the name of Mike approached me and asked me if I needed help. I asked if they took trade in cars, and he said with a smile "oh yes" and proceeded to help me fully, by getting me one of the BEST deals I've EVER SEEN at a car lot. My APR was pretty nice, and my monthly payments is right where I need/want them to be thanks to Mr. Bustamante. Overall experience was superb, and I'll NEVER go anywhere in San Diego again, but Autocity for my vehicles. Best believe I told many people about this place, and I hope it brings Autocity many great customers for years too come!!! Thank you Mike, thank you Mr. Bustamante, and thank you AutoCity!!!

<Text>Buying a car from auto city with ramils help was the most ideal experience anyone could want from a dealership. Very helpful , attentive but most certainly not overbearing or shadowing.I felt comfortable looking at all the cars on the lot and had all the time to my self to enjoy test driving...and by myself.  the car selection and quality is incredible...the prices are more than fair. i highly recommend ramil and auto city to anyone looking to buy a car.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I recently moved to CA, and was in search of a small car to get around in. I found a great looking 2008 VW Rabbit listed on their site and stopped by to check it out. Every car on the lot including my VW was detailed to near perfection and priced to sell. The staff were very friendly, patient, professional and understanding. I put a deposit on the car and came back a few days later to sign the paperwork. With the help of Mike Monastyrski and the sales manager, Jorge I was able to drive away in a great car for a great price in no time at all! Keep up the great work, Mike!!< /Text>

Mike and Stan were incredible! They found us the perfect car we love our 2013 VW Jetta TDi. Mike helped me with selecting just the right car that fit our needs and budget. Mike had patience with me as I looked at the cars on the lot giving me some suggestions along the way he made selections, all of which I liked, a Golf, Jetta hatchback, a Chevy Cruze, a Hyundai Elantra, a Ford etc. All of the cars met one really important criteria I explained to him “no CVT transmissions” I had a really bad experience with the Honda we traded in Mike had actually listened to me. After help from Mike we were given the opportunity to drive our 2013 Jetta TDi home for a night so I could show it to my wife, and purchase it the following day. Mike did an amazing job meeting our needs, my wife loved the car when she saw me pull up in it the smile on her face was priceless. We called back right away to tell Mike we were ready to buy it and completed the the paperwork the following day and drove home in a car we were happy with that met our needs. Thank you Mike, and thank you Auto City for making this our best car buying experience by far. We will recommend your dealer and Mike to our friends and family.</Review>

<text>I'd like to start off by saying thank you to JR for being so helpful and courteous, even when I came in an hour before they closed. And even after they were closed, he stayed late (which way past the time he should have gone home) just to make sure I was happy and would be able to take home the car I wanted that night. I really appreciate that!

I'm in the military and stationed in 29 Palms, so I could have went to any of the cities nearby to buy a car. I DID NOT want to end up getting ripped off and screwed over somewhere, so I spent about 9 hours online reviewing dealers that helped get people with troubled credit financed, had really good customer feedback/reviews, and ran an honest business. The two best options were AutoCity and Classic Chariots, which I ended up deciding on AutoCity because of better feedback, and less negative reviews.

I took a Uber from 29 Palms down to El Cajon, a 3 hour ride, which cost me over $200. I would never do that if I wasn't of happy with what I saw online, and I was not disappointed. As soon as I got there, it was already about an hour before they closed, and it was a Monday so I'm sure everyone was ready to go home. As soon as I walked in I was helped immediately, and wasn't thrown some sales pitch. They let me test drive the vehicles by myself, which I really liked since other dealers will have the sales guys ride with you just to throw you some sales pitch and talk you into buying the car. By the time I got done test driving the first vehicle, it was already closing time. Instead of telling me to come back tomorrow, JR let me test drive a few more vehicles until I found the car I liked. He even stayed past closing time to make sure I'd be able to go home that night with a vehicle. He filled it up with a full tank of gas at no charge before I left and told me if I ever had any questions or needed anything to make sure and give him a call.

The financing process was pretty simple and I didn't have to deal with the stress of negotiating because of their no haggle pricing. They price there vehicles usually pretty close to what the Kelly Blue Book value would be. I also didn't have to go to the DMV for ANYTHING because they handle all the paperwork there, if you're registering your car in California.

If you're looking for an honest place to buy a vehicle from that won't cheat you over just to make a profit, and sell you a vehicle that is reliable than I would definitely recommend this place!<//text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

<review>I had a great experience at AutoCity Dealership!
I was in the market for a 2015 Toyota Corolla and had been to many dealerships all over the Area including calling several over the phone. None were giving me a fair price that I had researched. I finally made my way to AutoCity and met Mike Manastyrski. He was AWESOME! He treated me like a valued customer and not like just another number walking into the office. They did not have the vehicle I wanted at their dealership but he was able to get it from the other dealership in the area. Mike gave me the fair deal I wanted without any back or forth negotiating and made the tiring process a lot easier.
Overall, Mike made the experience actually enjoyable and I absolutely love my new Toyota Corolla. In financing he was also GREAT. Anyway, if you are in the market for a new Toyota please just go straight to AutoCity and ask for Mike, he will definitely take care of you and get you the car you want at a good price.< /review>< user_name>

For any sceptical first time car buyer..
Please go to Auto City first!
I highly recommend this place!

I've received excellent customer service from the guys that washes the cars to the guys handling the paperworks.

Shoutout to Alfred who treated me like family. From start to finish, any questions i have.. He was just a text away!

To Jorge and Tim from finance who helped worked with me and made my car buying experience less scary.

I originally got a Fiat 500 pop manual transmission thinking i would learn it..

I couldn't with san diego traffic. :(

A month later of trying, i told the guys at Auto City about my situation and no questions asked! I was able to trade it in to an Automatic one!

Unfortunately not the best at the service dept. Had the worst experience with their guy "Jay" at service dept. Kept my car for 2 days to check the brakes, and didn't do nothing, not even to call me back to let me know when ready, NOT GOING BACK FOR SERVICE AT ALL, excuses, excuses, the manager told me they never call me back because Jay was at a meeting, really 2 days?
Definitely last purchase here. And put 40 miles on my car, what a brake test!!👎</Review></record></dataset><record>

Mike and the crew from Auto City made the process incredibly easy and fast! I was able to work out all the details over the phone with Mike before driving 1 hour from San Marcos. Mike pulled through and Ramil had our papers ready to sign when we walked in. I would buy from Auto City again. I used the USAA Car buying service to find the car and Auto City is a certified dealer with USAA. Mike and Ramil were completely knowledgeable about the USAA process and had me in my new car after about 30 minutes after arriving. Thank you Mike!</review><time>1516418485236</time>< pics>

<text>My experience at AutoCity was okay. I got a car fairly quickly. Took 1 day. But the hype and the high reviews about this place  are a little misleading. Perhaps it’s my fault for not doing my research enough.
Anyway, why 3 stars? Well I got what came for, so really no less. It could have been worse. Why not higher? Well, they advertise fair prices, high quality inspections to ensure the cars are well maintained before you buy them, and non-pushy, relaxed sales tactics. However, I was constantly rushed and pushed to buy the car quickly, being told that the cars don’t last long, and that someone else was coming to look at the car later. I realize those may be true, but it’s not really following true to the company “vision” or whatever. I was also pressured to make this review several times. Just leave me alone please! If it’s not pertaining to the car and my purchase, please stop harassing me.
As far as fair prices/quality of of the vehicle, it seems okay. I’m a little concerned because the vehicle, despite having a decent engine, starts to struggle around 65 mph, which the salesman told me was normal for those cars...but it’s not. Also, the S belt started acting up right away. There are a couple of cracks on the wind shield despite having “no damage”. The vehicle exterior was dirty. Part of the interior- I don’t even know what it is...it looks like an iPod holder or something, is broken and can come right out.
It’s these little things that really add up to a less-than-stellar experience. I wish my salesman was more knowledgeable and less pushy (considering the company views). I wish the car was in a more “prepared” state when I bought it.
There is a 3 day return policy, so I could have returned it. And I considered it, but I opted against it.
A positive thing they do is take care of all the DMV issues. So that’s nice. I would have preferred to write this review after I received the registration/title in the mail as it takes a few weeks, but I’m writing early in the hopes that my sales agent will stop asking me to write one.

TL:DR
Nice place if you know exactly what you want and what you will pay for it.
Not the best experience otherwise due to misleading advertising.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d959cd3d42bbbd:0x7c6c0d2bf48bbcfd<//GmapID></record>

< Review>
Just purchased a vehicle at Auto city in El Cajon. Worked with Obed Pizano and it was a great experience. He was very helpfull with the whole process and felt like I got treated like family. Everybody was very helpfull and worked really hard to get me financed on a great deal. Need a great deal, come to Auto city.!!< /Review>

When it comes to cars for sale we at Auto City Sales believe you deserve a hassle free experience where you can feel free to compare and contrast just like any wise consumer should.  Reading awesome reviews like yours is our clear sign that we are getting it right for our most valuable asset ever.  You!  Thanks again.'}< /Resp><review>I've been dreading going to a dealership to get a car, but Auto City, to my surprise, made the whole experience fantastic! Timur and the staff were so friendly, and not pushy whatsoever. They gave us the time we needed to search around, and didn't give us a hard time about leaving to see what another dealership had to offer. Also, one thing I love about Auto City is that they offer their customers a great deal up front from the very start. No haggling or trying to talk them down. They are firm on their prices, and after doing weeks of research, have the best prices in the region. I defintely recommend this dealership. Thank you Timur for my new Prius!</review>< pictures>

I bought a car in late April 2018 that I love, only problem is that I purchased it with an error code that the scanners at AutoCity can't pick up. I took it to Kearny VW and they could see the error code clear as day and were willing to work with AutoCity to get it fixed, but no, AutoCity only works with South Bay VW. So I offered to take my car to South Bay VW so they can give AutoCity proof of my cars error code, but my request was denied. 3 days after hassling with AutoCity they tell me that it's NOT covered under warranty, but I do have an option... which was to pay half of the repair (if the error code was proven) the repair is estimated at $1,000!
What an absurd dealership. They truly proved to me how much they value their customers.</Review>

We had just visited a nearby dealer, knowing full well that the advertisement we were bombarded with on the radio was fake in some regards, but we figured, why not check it out.

After we left, a little more disappointed than we thought we would be (they don't have any prices on their used cars, because "we sell too many used cars to keep up with putting stickers on them", we came across Auto City.  We decided (my step son and I) to stop there and see what they had in stock in the way of VW cars.  My step-son had his mind set on a German car, and VW seems to have a nice dependable cars.

We were instantly wow'd and also skeptical about the good prices we were seeing.  Of course, being how I am, I kept thinking there was some kind of catch.  I even tried to wait a little bit to write my review.  I was approved through Wells Fargo Dealer Services for the loan, and was weary about getting the warranty from Auto City, but they promised me that if I had any problems with it, they would back me up.  I've had and read about several bad experiences with these dealer offered warranties, that I have to admit I was scared we'd be stranded with a warranty, and some weird stipulation that would not allow us to receive warranty service.  Our salesperson assured us this would not be the problem, and he and the rest of the people that worked there would personally help us if it ever came to that.

If we ever do have to use the warranty, I hope we don't, I will update my post here.<//text>< Rate>

After doing hours and hours of research on dozens of websites (from USAA to CarFax), I pulled up several cars that peaked my interest for their outstanding value and quality. Once I narrowed it down to a few and started thinking about test drives, I came to an interesting conclusion: every single one was with Auto City. I settled on a BEAUTIFUL 2013 Ford C Max Hybrid that is in EXCELLENT condition. The asking price was actually below the KBB value, their insurance package was a steal at $2000 for 36 mo, the APR on my loan was INSANELY low (8.4% on someone with a credit history less than a year old), super affordable GAP insurance, and they even filled the tank with gas. The whole process was stress and pressure free. If you're even remotely considering purchasing a used car, you can trust Auto City to give the best bang for your buck!<//text>

<Text>I don't normally write reviews for car dealers but I must share my experience at Auto city. My wife and I were in the market for a used car and we found these guys online and made a appointment for a test ride with Alfred Mendoza their sale representative . We arrived and they pulled the car out and gave us the keys to test drive it (with no sales rep in the back seat). Alfred said make sure you really like it before you make your decision. Talk about no pressure or hassle. We started out on a great first step. We test drove 2 other cars and than sat down with Alfred on the one we liked. He was so great, truly a professional. We felt as we were friends..not like my other dealeship experiences. He was straight forward and give us all the details and I felt he was honest in everyway with us. I have to say I was blown away. I told him we needed to think about it over lunch and he said no problem, just give him a  call if we changed our mind wanted it. My wife and I were blown away how friendly  Alfred was and most of all how great the experience was overall . No pressure no hassle. We went to CarMax to compare and we couldn't find the same type of customer service or vehicle. We returned to Alfred with Autocity and purchased the car.  Even the Finance manager Ramil was great, super friendly and amazing service. I can not recommend  them enough based on our experience . They even offer a 6 month or 6 mile warranty at no extra cost and a 3 day no question asked vehicle  return policy at no extra fee. I'm telling you guys these guys are doing something great here. I even had the vehicle checked by my mechanic and it's in great shape just like Alfred said. Highly recommend  Alfred and Autocity for your vehicle purchases. 6 stars if I could give them. Ask for Alfred, great person and great person to buy your next car from.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<time>1376524566747<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My wife and I bought a used Prius at Auto City Sales six weeks ago and enough time has now gone by that I know I made the right decision buying the car from them. I've had it checked out by the service department at Kearney Mesa Toyota and the car is exactly what they Stan told me it was - a great buy in great shape.

After having a really unfortunate experience trying to buy a used vehicle at San Diego Toyota I started doing a lot of research and found out that many auto dealers, new and used, have terrible Yelp ratings. I finally found Auto City Sales by the time I was simultaneously talking to half a dozen dealers, and I actually found out that the fact that they have a good Yelp rating really did set them apart.

Stan was always honest, polite, thorough, and informative. I run my own company, and didn't have a lot of time to buy a car, so I really valued that he gave me simple, short, direct answers. There was no negotiating or BS - they had the car I wanted, it was a great price, it was exactly what they said it was. I came by, test drove the car, did all the paperwork and was in and out in less than an hour. I'm only in my late thirties, so I've probably bought less than a dozen cars in my life, but this was by far the best, and fastest experience I've ever had with buying a car.

Now I'm recommending them to my wife's folks (and I like my wife's folks) and whoever else I know that is buying a new car. I even recommended them to one of the service technicians over at Toyota of San Diego!

I've read some of the negative reviews that these guys have gotten, and I notice that what those people really seem upset about is the fact that the Auto City folks don't haggle. I think that's pretty short sighted because I looked up the KBB on the car I was buying and I know I got an amazing deal. Of course they don't haggle - they don't waste your time trying to sell you at an inflated price, they just give you the best price they can afford. I really appreciated that.

The other negative review I noticed said they were rude and evasive. That may have been their experience - I suspect they misread direct as rude, which would be  their loss because these guys were just about the only auto dealers I talked to who were scrupulously honest about everything from beginning to end.

Basically, I can't say enough good things about them. Thanks, Auto City.<//Text>< pictures>

I bought Ford Fusion yesterday. 2 days ago, I visited Autocity on my way went to school,  maybe around 15 minutes. Nick introduce couple of cars for me. And next day I bought. Because I felt that autocity is honesty and reliable. I am satisfied and next month my friends come to el cajon,  I will introduce autocity.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>This is the best car dealership you will ever find!!!  I'll try to keep it short, but these guys definitely know what they're doing at Auto City Sales in El Cajon, CA!  I've had the pleasure of working with them on two separate occasions now and couldn't have asked for anything more.  The service was great, the guys were all very professional, and they took their time to make sure they get YOU what YOU want.  After I purchased a 2007 Infiniti G35 in early March from them, I had the car for a little over a month, when another driver ran a red light and totaled it...  Luckily, they gave me a great price and my insurance paid me out what they said it was worth, which was $3,000 more than the price they sold it to me for!  I went back and explained the situation and they couldn't have been more helpful!  They put off my down payment until my insurance check came in and got me in a 2007 BMW 328i that same day in early May.  These guys really saved me a lot of hassle and heartache!  Victor and Ramil are both INCREDIBLE, but go see anyone at Auto City Sales and I promise you that you will not be disappointed.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>The Good:

I would describe this dealership as the "Costco" of used cars. What I mean by that is, you get what you pay for and the price is fair. This is opposed to the haggling, bargaining, and hassle that goes into most other dealers.

The actual dealers are the most polite, friendly, and honest out off all the dealers I met when shopping for my current vehicle. Victor Gonzalez in particular who helped me pick out my 2012 Yaris was very honest and straightforward with any questions I had. He did not employ any shady tactics in trying to sell me the car and did not waste my time, if anything, he made the process as pain free as possible. He has a great sense of humor and seems like a great guy. He even gave me brand new floor mats which I didn't see until I had gotten home!

The Bad: If you come here expecting to haggle your way into a "steal of a deal" don't bother. Their prices are set for a reason and they don't like to waste time. But on the flip side, the vehicles did seem to be of good quality, well maintained, with detailed vehicle history reports.

The Ugly: The only things I found shady were their promise of a "Warranty" that really covers nothing. If it weren't for this, I would have easily given 5 stars. However, as soon as I inquired about it, they gave me the full details and let me know that it is a "buyer beware" situation. However, the risk is worth the fair price you will pay for the vehicle, because I do not believe that any of the vehicles they sell are lemons or junkers due to the extensive honesty with which they present the car history. Its no more risky than buying from a private seller, but only slightly less risky than a "certified" dealer.

Overall: I would recommend this place for friends and family. As long as you've had your coffee, know what the "warranty" is, and set aside a day to do your shopping, Auto City Sales in El Cajon will make the process as safe, stressless, and fun as possible!<//review>< Date>

This place is a scam. They promised payments at $350.00,at time of signature the price went to $477.00 without justification and the car was a SALVAGED TITLE!!!
TOTALED AND REPAIRED!!!  BUYER BEWARE.
when We requested my cash deposit back they came up with a half dozen excuses why I couldn't get it immediately. After threatening Dmv investigation and consumer affairs complaints they wrote me a check in lieu of the cash I gave them and I got taxed for the amount of the deposit. So again BUYER BEWARE.  I WASN'T THE ONLY PERSON THOSE DAYS THAT I SAW THIS PLAYED ON.<//Review>

< review>
The folks at Auto City were very welcoming, unlike every other dealership I've ever been to. I scheduled a test drive with Ramil through USAA's Car Buying Service, and when I arrived he showed me the car and left my wife and I alone to look it over and talk. Ramil had honest answers to all my questions which really eased our minds, but more importantly he made sure we were comfortable and informed as we made the decision to purchase the vehicle. I bought a solid car that will last many years, but if I must purchase another vehicle or have friends/family looking to buy I will most definitely recommend Auto City and especially Ramil.< /review>

<Text>I drove all the way from Los Angeles to buy a BMW X3 from Ramil. I found the car online and I called them. Ramil took the application over the phone and within an hour he called be to let me know the financing was approved at a great interest rate. My credit is not great and I was expecting a much higher interest rate. We drove 2 hours and when we got there the car was ready for me to take for a test drive. The condition of the car was perfect and it was listed forat least  $2000 lower than similar cars for sale, by owner or dealers. There was no pressure at all. we completyed the paperwork and were in and out in less than an hour. My daughter is trading in her old car and getting a new one from Ramil this weekend.  The best car buying experience ever.  A++++++ service<//Text>< pics>

<response>None<//response><Review>My wife needed a new car about 2 years ago. We didn't have the best credit so got denied at one of the big dealerships.

Then we found AutoCity... We worked with Denis. It was the best car buying experience either one of us ever experienced. Zero pressure, very patient with the wife changing her mind lol she ended up with a 2009 Honda Accord V6 with 58k miles. It's been running great with Zero problems.

About a month ago 6/2015 my 20 year old Subaru finally died :( 210k miles...

Since my wife scored a pretty nice car we went back to AutoCity hoping the experience we had last time wasn't just a fluke.

This time I worked with Ramil. He got me into a Toyota Tacoma 2008 with only 29k Miles!!! Beautiful truck with a decent finance rate!

I had thought my first experience with Auto City couldn't get any better. Well it did! Ramil really pulled strings and worked with me to get me into the truck he knew I fell in love with.

This place has completely changed my view and opinion of "Car Salesmen".

I highly Recommended this place!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Awesome Experience
I have just purchased a Nissan Xterra from them last week. I am a good online shopper so I have checked every listing for a used 2005 Xterra in my price range including Craig's List. I saw the car trough another website they advertise in. So I checked their reviews and decided to go there. Their price for my Xterra was almost 1000.00 under blue book but I do not know much about cars so I wanted to show it to my mechanic. Now here is the great part these guys were so cool I went there test drove the car for a few exits brought it back and they have not pressured me at all. The next morning I went back and asked them if I can take it for pre purchase inspection. No problem they gave me the keys I took it from El Cajon to PB to my mechanic spend a few hours checked everything. Car passed with flying colors except for a few cosmetic things. I went back and asked to fix the tail light reflectors. They did everything. I am so happy with my car. Best car shopping experience. Very kick back friendly people. I will recommend them to all my friends.< /Review>

< Review>
Im a first time buyer
went to auto sales to finance the 2007 bmw 328i with 70,000 miles. i met Tim on the spot and we were right at it Tim went to get the car.  i inspected around the vehicle the interior and the exterior was pretty good i was very satisfied for the price. test driving was pretty good too of course we headed to the gas station to fill up the tank($10). Ramil did the financing, credit check and all the other paper work plus the approval for a loan took about 15-30 minutes not really sure i didn't pay attention to the time anyways the whole process took about good 3-5 hours
i had good credit with a low apr i wasn't expecting very satisfied on that part
the vehicles warranty was up to par in what i needed the most for the right price because you are able to choose what meets your budget and Ramil help me with that

full tank of gas would of been nice though and received one key but they informed me if they had 2 they would've gave me both

but still for a first time buyer off a dealers this was a great experience thanks to Tim and Ramil</Review>

<review>HUGE thumbs up to these guys. My brother bought a 2010 honda civic late 2014 and I just recently bought a 2007 bmw 328i early february 2015. These guys are good, super helpful answered every question, fixed any doubt. Specially to my man Jake Baier, this dude was ridiculously helpful words cannot describe how good this guy is. All b.s. aside you need a car, just look for this guy and pray you get sent afterwards with ramil, both of these guys.. WOW, definition of customer service.</review>< Pics>

Stopped by AutoCity to look at used cars and was met by Obed. He showed me some cars in my price range and helped get me a loan since I had a bankruptcy last year. Check them out if you’re looking for a new used car.<//text>

<text>Overall good experience and transaction. However, right after I signed the papers, Jose told me there was only one key/faub. Well getting a second one will cost me a few hundred bucks. That was annoying. Just beware that if the car you are buying is a repo, it may not have the owners manual, second key, etc.</text></record>

{'time': 1427129655379, 'text': 'Hello Nicholas. Thank you for visiting our dealership numerous times and an opportunity to earn your business. Thank you for providing your comments so that we and our potential customers can evaluate our business. However, what you are saying is simply not true. Absolutely all cars we have have clean titles. We have never sold a car with a salvage title.  Never. Yes, some cars have accidents on their record - a small portion of our inventory and we do property disclose that to every customer by providing a free carfax report on our website and at the time of sale. We are very transparent and straightforward. We could not sell you a car for the reasons not to be mentioned on a public domain for privacy reasons. However, we gave you enough  time and courtesy during the many times you stopped by.\nWe strive for progress not perfection and unfortunately negative feedback is part of our quest for the best customer experience. Our business is cars and customer service and we are very motivated. We are going to take your comments into account to improve. Thank you.'}< /resp>

< review>
I had to quickly purchase a new car as mine was taken.  Don't get me wrong, I loved my Camry hybrid.  I was looking for another Toyota hybrid.  Fortunately they had a 2016 Prius that I took for a ride.  The exterior and interior were in tip top shape.  It's a bit of a rougher ride than I was used to, but it has a Power option that lets me safely merge onto the freeway.

I took it to the Toyota dealer to have it checked out.  First of all, the engine was in pristine condition and the oil was so clean I couldn't see it on the dipstick.  Want to know what was wrong with it?  The license plate light was out!  I gladly paid the service fee.

From beginning to end, from Stan to Michael to the gentleman in Finance, this was a superior experience.  The financing was easy even though my credit score recently dropped a bit.  I will be recommending all family and friends to Auto City.  It was my pleasure to read this review and I sent along a box of chocolates as my thanks!  GO Auto City!</review>

(Translated by Google) My son, who is studying in the United States, bought a used car here today. After the purchase, it seems that he sent me to my house by car in about 50 minutes. He also taught me about voluntary insurance, giving me a gentle and polite impression. Thank you for making the last photo shoot happy 😊

アメリカ留学中の息子が本日中古車をこちらで購入。購入後、家まで50分近くかけて車で送ってくださった模様。任意保険も教えて下さり、優しく丁寧な印象。最後写真撮影も快くしてくれたみたいで、ありがとうございました😊<//Review>
