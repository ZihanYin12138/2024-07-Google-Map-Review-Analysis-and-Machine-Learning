Wonderful food and service. We come here often to see one of our favorite servers. She remembers us every time and gets us to try new things. The background music is soothing and brings a nice vibe to the space. The outdoor space is welcoming and creates a nice atmosphere away from the shopping mall feel inside. Love this place!<//Review>

<Review>Would have given 5 stars..gave excellent service.  On the other hand, we were a party of two and there were plenty of tables available and the hostess sat people who arrived after us.  When we approached to ask why hostess said the others were bigger parties(?)  Does not make sense when tables were available.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Nice little spot at the mall. Good food and great atmosphere. We were lucky to get an actual singer singing few classic songs to light up the mood. Servers were extremely nice and attentive. My mother loved the mocha here and Mediterranean salmon dish. If mother is happy then I am happy!!!! Must try this place.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO94-VhjwFd6BdBfmE_IEeltJyk5XSihqZug1Xq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvEv4LYpcQN52NlHT0oAYDlmgx1G9rVbnsuXFJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwo1NH569KJ3XsnImua0GFgQtpV6eBCGu7vER-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8SeZsJrqtFFm4eE_X6WymcMT1Z-3UQHuJY7Ld=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfPbPbEG_PskZz1KKJMiFWcCbZMvrEDGHDkleo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRPV_SkJRQv2lD0a3cZlwgMoZ1dE84-Fec0_IX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK489IYmA9W6IWLg01qzwxQfpi4DSrUqYN2s6p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMC3bx5RP1OSM2QJ0vO46y9pRZlAVVqM1FpAKA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dcdf2f80af9bfb:0x2d0b31fc1fa593de< /gmap_id></record>

Their cocktails are solid and consistent (oh and delicious!).  Had the salami pizza and it is clear they have an official pizza oven here - the dough was perfect!  My companion had the spaghetti bolognese and it was top notch - texture and flavor were amazing.  This was my first time here and I am definitely coming back (soon!)< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2f80af9bfb:0x2d0b31fc1fa593de< /Gmap_id></record>

The price of their food is for a fine dinning and the taste does not live up to it. The authentic Italian taste is not there. It's all aesthetics. Their pizza taste like shakey's pizza. Olive garden is better in taste, experience and price. One of the review says their rude and I will agree on that. They want you in and out fast even though you ordered a lot and you're with a huge group.</text>

When my significant other wanted to come here for his birthday lunch, it was an unexpected delight. I love Italian food and people very much, having spent eight years with an Italian family before. My significant other's father goes to Italy every year and loves to spend time in Como. Few restaurants in the United States that we've been to have felt Italian, and this was one of them.

When you come here, nearly entire shopping center scene disappears from your senses. The interior cleverly uses a more honeyed wood color from floor-to-ceiling, creating a more cocooned, relaxed setting. The ingredients used here are fresh and fabulous. It is essentially what food should be but in the United States a lot of things are overly processed and our agricultural industrial complex farming makes for produce lacking in flavor.

I was pleasantly surprised by the tomato sauce tasting just like what I had remembered of a freshly made tomato sauce according to a Nonna's recipe. I hadn't tasted this in almost a decade.

We had spaghetti con polpette and pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The crust, pasta, and bread all had great texture and taste. I  loved the bitter bite of the arugula. Imported cheeses were delectable. The meat in the polpette was fresh, the polpette were dense and generous in portion. Pasta was undoubtedly al dente. I love, love, love tomatoes, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar had a beautiful, ripe fruity taste.

The European Union bans an artificial growth hormone that is used a lot in American dairy (rBST, synthesized from a strain of e coli) which some people have adverse reactions to. These reactions can be in creases of inflammation in the body, adrenal and thyroid problems, cystic acne related to hormonal problems, and migraines. My significant other and I have these health issues when we eat dairy with rBST but we had none of these reactions to the foods that we ate at this restaurant.

Speaking of Nonna's, I was curious about  a photo of a chocolate cake and a flourless chocolate cake described as a torta della nonna dessert menu. A torta della nonna is a lemony custard tart, isn't it?

We had a white chocolate, berry, pistachio, and cream cake that was utterly delectable. One of the best things we've ever eaten.

The people who work here are very attentive and congenial. We appreciate their warmth and hospitality very much. We'd love to keep coming back.

And, their selection of music is primo.< /Text>

Walked by this place for years, but finally felt in the mood and tried it. Gotta say, I'm usually not a fan of spaghetti or pastas in general, but really liked their bolognase. And the chicken marsala was so flavorful... And buttery. A little on the pricey side, but portions are big enough to be easily shared.<//Text>

Food is overall great, pepperoni pizza a little more on cheesier and greasier side than I'd like. However, it may be silly to say, but the ice water with lemon slices is so refreshing and crisp tasting. Service is good, and while I know it's located in a mall, can get loud due to crying babies both inside and outside the restaurant.</text>

This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the last few times have been really bad. I ordered a pizza which came out burned. When I pointed it out I got a BS response saying "well its a little overcooked but do you really want another one"? YES I DO!! I am not paying for lousy food, I can get that anywhere. On my next visit I ordered a glass of chardonnay and it came with a very small pour. I asked if they thought it was a little small and got a very curt response that it was their standard. I have eaten there many, many times and this pour was NOT their standard. Sorry but it is off my list now. Too many better choices.<//Text>

They have a seafood Mac and cheese that’s super creamy, rich and mouthed watering. It’s a little pricey, but a good spot. The manager is Italian and super friendly and welcoming.< /review>< Pictures>

Foods were tasty and I enjoyed our lunch! I was too hungry and forgot to take photos of our meals though 😂 I liked that their pizza shape was ugly 🤪💕

I had a very welcoming experience. So, I am sorry for whoever had a bad experience with them 😭</Text>

Wanted to love it, but just feel sick now. My husband and I went to Quattro Café tonight for the second time. The first time was nice and we were at the mall so we wanted to go back. The service was great, they are so nice, very quick, and remade a dish for us with no rude attitude.  The food is what lost us. Out of all three dishes we both agreed that the food tasted like it came from the freezer or from a can. Now we are at home sick to our stomachs wishing we just didn’t eat the food. Saw online that someone had recommended the seafood pizza. It was hardly cooked at all and just a mess of God knows what. They should take that item off the menu to be frank. The pork ravioli we sent back and they brought us the cheese ravioli instead, it was slightly better but still is not worth the price for the freezer food quality. The live music is cool and the staff was great, we will probably just go back to the bar area and not have food.< /Text>

Look at the bottom of pizza...it is so burned. I think they never clean the oven and grill. And I believe that Prego is much better than its spaghetti.</text>

One word: rude. Tried to make a reservation, but the lady at the front said it's fine if we don't because they are not busy. This is during Mother's day. We just want to make sure so we tell her to write our name. However, when we arrived there at our time, she skipped us and gave the table away. We called the manager and neither of them apologized. Worst service ever! If you want a classy meal, eat somewhere else where you have to overpay for good service as opposed to terrible service. Saddest Mother's Day because well, they were rude and didn't apologize. One word makes a difference: sorry. They need to learn that word.<//Review>

You should ask if the patio is available.
I didn't expect that the pizza would be so good. Nothing to say about the Salad.
4star review is because of the price< /review>

The salad we ordered was great, the pizza was cold when they served us, one of the guys split wine on me and only say sorry. It is a very busy place, so you should have patience, it takes time for them to get your order.</Review>

So here goes another 5 star review to this restaurant yes it goes to the fantastic food good service Live entertainment on the weekends which is rare for Orange County this is not a boring restaurant We actually had the pleasure to be there a few nights ago back as the boss himself diminaco  Hosted a event gypsy king nigth Fantastic guitarist we ate we dance we drink what more can you ask for inside South coast plaza Cheers to diminaco  For his inspired dishes  From his country Italy fantastic performances on the weekends and special events that keep us dancing till midnight  As a food critic in a travel reporter for Southern California trust me you don't want to miss this place  Or they're special events 👍😘< /Text>

Truly an amazing menu…simple but everything is delicious and authentic.  Something for everyone…even those who don't eat pasta!   I always ask for a plate of parmiggiano reggiano chunks and prosciutto to start….don't forget a glass of bubbly…very festive.< /Text>

Poor service and very expensive for a cafe.  Yes, the food is good, but for an upscale cafe that charges a mandatory 18% gratuity, the service is terrible.  I don't mind paying a nice gratuity if it's warranted, but it took 30 minutes to get our order.  And my Diet Coke over 10 minutes to arrive at my table.  I had to ask twice.  I won't go back.  Doesn't matter how good the food is.  I refuse to leave a mandatory gratuity for poor service.< /review>

Good food and great service by Boubou! Had a great time. The grilled lamb with risotto al tartufo was excellent! Special of the day. Dessert chosen by Boubou was yuuummy! Baked apple a la mode!<//text>

< Review>
I was here for an early dinner (the time slot in which most people have happy hour).  I only had 30 minutes for dinner before volunteer training.  I asked Kelly (if I remember the server's name correctly) if the Pollo alla Birra took a long time to prepare since I had a limited amount of time.  He told me that it would take 10 minutes.  Awesome!

In 10 minutes, I had a plate of subtly seasoned (the taste of lemon was dominant for those who like hints of lemon).  The broccoli had a garlic seasoning which was good.  I loved the asiago mashed potatoes.  It's not often a restaurant puts asiago in their mashed potatoes but it's an excellent idea.

In terms of service, I didn't have to wait  for the bill or the takeout box (the portions are generous).  The coffee I ordered towards the end of the meal were put in a to go coffee cup.  2 questions: Was my server psychic?  This type of upscale restaurant has to go coffee cups?!

Needless to say, this has been one of the most magical, seamless restaurant experiences I've ever had and I dine out a lot.  The next time I'm in town, I'm coming back to try other dishes!< /Review>

I am disabled since 2012 wheelchair bound for Five years.
They assigned a unit for me where they can see me (if i fall) in clear sight.
The manager and the staff are Caring and Excellent in their respective assignments.

This storage facility is very well run. Always clean. My only problem is with office hours. They close at 5pm and for an hour at lunchtime, which is where my problem lies. Lunchtime is the only time I have during weekdays. Other than that my experience with this buisness was positive.< /review>

<Text>Had to go to this one because the sister site we made our reservation didn't tell us that the only unit they had in the size we needed was upstairs.  When we got to this site we had the type of lock that ever other storage place required, but this place changed their latches that didn't work with regular locks. So... We had to buy one of their locks, which is like a vending machine lock. Always working to squeeze more money out of people.<//Text>< pictures>

My question is this:  Why do you charge a longtime, good customer more than you charge a brand new customer via your "web rates"?  The rates I pay for my 5'x10', my 10'x10' and my 10'x20' are all in excess of your so called "web rates" for units of equal size.  I understand incentives, such as first month rent free, but shouldn't you show a certain amount of courtesy to your present, good customers by NOT charging them more than you would charge a new, unproven customer?<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Went here today 4/20/18 I came all the way from Las Vegas to put some of my aunts belongings back in storage for her at this location. One of my relatives tagged along, so we get the lock off however it’s stuck, we tried like 6 times to push it open nothing. Saw a guy in his storage asked where the mangers are for help, thankfully he told me that they live on site you just have to knock on the door. Walked over to their office, was greeted with i’m assuming the manger, she was very cold & seemed liked I was bothering her.. & finally asked what unit It was. What was weird was she brought her little 3 yr old kid with her & I’m assuming her boyfriend out to walk me over there I have no idea why? I told her “Thank you so much & that I was sorry” & she didn’t respond at all with any type of answer or glance my way. Low & behold we had to push the latch further out for it to open. & she told my cousin in a snobby way “You have to push it far out to open it” Then they just all walked away. If that was the case she could of told me that when I came to the door. Like I mentioned earlier she seemed irritated that I was there. Whatever her name was she needs to work on her people skills & be a little more nice.<//text>

If I could give this storage facility a negative star review I would. My mother rented a unit in hopes of transitioning from Vegas to Highland. Secure storage had 1 job and that was to be secure. Her unit was broken into NOT ONCE but TWICE within ONE MONTH! The facility has done nothing to fix their problem. She has lost valuable antiques and family heirlooms. Please DO NOT give this company your business if you value your belongings.<//Text>

"SecurCare Self Storage" cannot secure your storage! My mother's unit was broken into along with other units. Then it was broken into AGAIN 2 weeks later. They have done nothing to help her resolve the issue. I don't understand how you have "24 hour surveillance " and let the same people break into your facility TWICE! If you care about your things, DO NOT trust this company. They still have not changed the light bulb across her unit that she requested.</Text>

If you look closely, the majority of these cookies are only a picture. There is only Raisin and Peanut Butter. They were completely out of chocolate chip. They said they havent had time to make any and its 3pm. They also have advertised, "FREE Cookie with meal purchase!" I used the bathroom to find out theres no toilet seat covers, toilet paper or paper towels.These are the types of places that make me wonder what goes on in the back when food is being prepared.</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Came in at noon on Sun, 01/10/2021. There was no rush and only one employee working. My sandwich was done, but instead of just charging me for it so I can leave, the employee set my sub aside and began making someone else’s sandwich. I said, “You know we’re paying separately, right? My sandwich has been done.”
She completely ignored me and continued making the other customer’s sub. I ended up just leaving. You don’t want my money? It’s cool.</Text>< pics>

<review>it's ok. it's always clean. the staff isnt very friendly, but they are not unfriendly either. I don't like the fact that i had to purchase something in order to get a "free"wifi code. I didn't mind purchasing an item, thats fine. what annoyed me is that i had to complete the transaction to get it. explained that I needed to use my phone to complete my order.  the cashier begrugendly gave me the code and said next time I have to pay first<//review>< pics>

A five star review of Avalon is a complete no brainer. Adam and his team consistently provide outstanding service. The integrity and honesty we have experienced while working with Avalon have given us, a couple of Airstream newbies, the confidence we needed to hit the road.

Adam helped us create a work list on our “new” 1958 Flying Cloud, helped us prioritize the needed work so we could approach it in phases. Adam patiently explains the work needed, and has taken the time to walk us through the new systems. While our rig had been previously modified, he made sure all essential systems were up to his high standards.

We are just completing a two month cross country road trip and it is not an exaggeration to say that we wouldn’t have made it without Avalon.< /review>

<review>I found Adam online and I brought my 63 Shasta 1500 trailer to him for a makeover.  New floor, added some electrical, lighting, got my stove working properly, new trailer hitch with sway bar, new inverter, new tires, hub caps and paint.  Adam did a fantastic job on her and now Trixie is a head turner as we drive down the highway to our next camping adventure.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Avalon RV is where I take my one of a kind trailer and Adam and crew have always taken care of my baby.  Really, they're the only ones I trust to work on it and they've flawlessly executed several very tedious repairs, replacements and upgrades on my trailer.< /Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Had a great experience at Avalon.  Adam reccomended the perfect system upgrade for my 2018 Winnebago View and result is working great.  We’re very good at working with my extended warranty provider and netted me 2k off the system upgrades.  Great shop<//Review>

<Text>Solar Addition

We have an older class B RV (‘98) and debated the effectiveness of attaching a solar to our one battery unit.  It’s now given us a feeling of comfort in knowing that we can now monitor the voltage and that we can dry camping leaving the refrigerator on battery during the day without draining the house battery.

Avalon was informative, convenient in the bay area, reasonable priced and on time.  Their equipment lines and connections were neat and used minimal space.  We’re happy with Avalon and our solar panels.

< Review>
We were very pleased with Adam and his team. We needed an appraiser to come up with an accurate worth of our 1967 Safari for insurance purposes. Adam did a thorough job and we were able to cover our “Trailer Swift” with the right amount of insurance.
Thanks for your professional and thorough appraisal!

I've got a well used off road pop-up trailer, far from the Airstreams the shop specializes in renovating.  I needed the electrical completely redone, and wanted to install a solar system that would keep me running in wilderness areas for a week at a time.

Adam's shop and service were outstanding.  Not only did they go the extra mile to ensure that every item in the trailer was working, they did an excellent job of setting me up with a great solar option that performed exactly as I wanted.

Adam's work was first class, the work was completed promptly (much faster than I expected, given the amount of work that needed to be done), and I couldn't be happier.  Absolutely worth it.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Adam's shop.<//Text>

Adam has had emergency phone calls from me from the road many times - always answers his phone with advice for quick fixes. His work is first rate, timely, and always within budget.

Very helpful.  Scheduled an appointment to have my battery replaced (because I thought it was essentially dead)... showed up and Avalon RV did a quick inspection and saw that I didn't actually need any work.  No charge and they sent me on my way happy!  Thanks.< /text>

<Review>My wife and I bought a classic 40+ year old RV on EBay, hoping to use it as a mobile office. The photos were beautiful and we bought it "as is" from Michigan, over 2,000 miles away, without an inspection.

We peeled back the vintage shag rug to do a simple carpet replacement and discovered that the wood floor and the overhead sleeping area were rotten with mold and wood decay from years of hidden water leaks. We soon had a long list of problems with plumbing, electricity, woodwork, appliances, cabinets, etc.

I checked out Avalon RV Restoration and liked the owner and the crew. They seem to love the restoration of classic trailers and do excellent work. They have about a dozen vintage trailers on the lot, mostly Airstreams, being restored or in line for restoration. I waited eight weeks for a slot.
Their prices are fair and the quality of work is superb. From custom cabinetry to ingenious electrical upgrades, you couldn't ask for more. Thanks to Avalon, we now have a beautiful wood interior, warm low-amp LED lighting, upgraded heater, modern upgraded converter and inverter, re-worked plumbing, new rooftop sealant, a first-rate battery bank, and high-output solar panels. They flood-tested the clear, gray, and black water tanks, and pressure tested the entire RV for leaks. The floor is actually stronger and better than new, with new frame welding and foam insulation sandwiched between marine plywood--no squeaks, no spongy spots, and finished with understated Marmoleum.

Avalon saved our vintage RV from the junk heap and kept a beautifully restored work of art on the road.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>I took my van into Adam to correct wiring problems on an install done by a different RV repair shop in Redwood City, V&V Bros.  V&V installed my 3 160W Renolgy panels on the roof to a Kodiak 1500W llithium generator, but it never charged after they installed it. I took it back 2 times to check the wiring but they blamed in first on the battery, and then said 2 of the panels weren't working.

I took it to Adam at Avalon for a second opinion before I sent the solar panels back for a refund. He found all 3 panels were working perfectly. The problem was the faulty wiring job. Some of the MC4 connectors on the roof were hooked up male to female and some female to female. The biggest problem was the splice where the two cables came through the gland into the van. They were spliced incorrectly in reverse polarity. The Zodiak has an automatic shut off if it detects reverse polarity so that's why it wasn't charging. I appreciate the thoroughness of Adam's work in detecting this flaw.  After he rewired the splice, the system has been working perfectly. It went from 10.88 A to full charge by the time I'd driven home. Since then I've gotten up to almost 13A daily. It's nice to have a system that works!

In addition to his patience in detecting these flaws, Adam also spent some time on the phone with a person on the Zodiak tech team who read questions and answers from a script. It was very frustrating to get a straight answer out of customer service, and at one point, I tried to grab the phone to unload my frustratrion on the tech person, but Adam moved it just in time and continued patiently to ask the questions he needed the answers to in order to proceed. A life lession there for me--restrain anger with customer service until you get what you need. Ha!

Adam was very knowledgeable about solar, enjoys talking about solar, and seems like a very kind person. The money I was charged for Adam's work was worth every penney and I would recommend him wholeheartedly.</Review>< response>

I refurbished a 1960's Boles trailer but had Avalon do all of the hard stuff (PV panels on roof, all electrical and fuses, polishing!).  They were very prompt, cost effective, and really nice people to work with.  I would highly recommend them if you need any work done on a camper/trailer.< /review>

<name>David LaFollette</name><Date>1515440828822< /Date><Text>I cannot say enough about Adam and his crew.  I first met Adam when we purchased an old Terry Trailer that needed some work, not only was everything explained but he took so much time making sure we understood how everything worked or should work.  I never saw him roll his eyes (I would have) every time I would stop by which was often, no trailer in tow, to ask him some question about our old trailer, basically free advice if it was something I could fix and he did so with all the patience of a father telling his son how to start the lawn mower, again (except Adam is like 30 years younger than me!).  He also inspired us to purchase an Air Stream which we did just a few months ago.  He also inspired us to purchase an Air Stream which we did just a few months ago and could not be happier.  Its businesses like Adams that renew our faith that there really are good people out there who while needing to and deserve to make a profit, make their customer the ultimate priority.  We own a small company ourselves and understand how important that trust is!  So, Air Stream or whatever you own, if you want quality, honesty and peace of mind, go see Adam and his crew!

Adam Blair of Avalon RV is knowledgeable and personable.  He performed water testing on my van that only a few places do in the Bay Area.  I am pleased with this service and Adam's patience, availability and  flexibility<//review>

<text>Avalon Rv helped us transform a funky vintage Airstream into a beautiful custom and modern home away from home on wheels.  The team at Avalon RV are more than capable in repairs as well as fine craftsmanship and creative detalis.  We love our Airstream and highly reccomend Adam Blair’s company for remodeling, installation of various features and systems and for any ongoing maintenance that comes with RV ownership.< /text>< gmap_id>

<text>Avalon RV performed a roof inspection, replaced the AC roof gasket and  resealed all seams on my 2002 Jayco Kiwi. Additional they repaired a hole in the fiberglass cause by a flying rock. The work was done in the time and within the estimated price. I was told that the fiberglass repair may not match the existing color but it came so close that you needed to know of the patch to notice it.
The only drawback is the long lead time. The closest appointment was about 10 weeks. If you are in a hurry this may not be the place for you but I found it worth the wait.< /text>< GmapID>

I have been a patient of DR Jafari for a long time. She takes great care of evaluating your needs and provides considerate advice. She has very good bed side manners and respect the patients wishes. The facility is clean and the staff are knowledgeable about the procedures.< /Review>

Highly recommended! Nice doctor and staff and up to the task with covid safety. Dr. Jafri was able to help me get rid of the dark circles that bothered me for ages. Also did fraxel co2 laser which helped a lot with my pored and am really happy with the improved tone and texture of my skin.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>had been coming to Amoderm for over a year now. I am very picky about where I go and who I trust. My experience has  been positive all around. Excellent and thorough service. Very knowledgeable doctor and staff. Above all the results are natural and beautiful. The office is lovely and inviting. I recommend for all your skin care needs. It's also very conveniently located. No pressure to do any procedure that I don't need and they are great at listening to my concerns and treatment goals.</text>< Pictures>

<text>I am a long time client of Amoderm for more than 4 years. I have  tried several treatments here. The office is very well organized. The nurses are very professional and of course I cannot write about Amoderm without mentioning Dr. Jafari. She is the best of best. Very nice and friendly. Super honest with the approachable personality. She never tries to upsell and always listens to your concerns and always tries to come up with the best plan around your budget. She has great aesthetic eyes and skills. The result is always natural. No body can figure out what I  have done after my procedures. Always look more rested and younger in a natural way.
PS: By the way try their microderm/facial  membership. You will not regret it.</text>< pics>

The office is super clean and the whole staff is super friendly. I trust Dr. Jafari with all my treatments and I always enjoy coming in to see her. I wouldn’t trust anyone else with my face and she always trust everything she recommends. I would recommend her to anyone who is looking for beauty treatments. I always look and feel amazing after I come see her.</Review>

I did my under eyes in 2018 for my weeding and the product is still in my eyes I had be reduced but no as before I really love it. They do different kinds of procedures but they specialize in face. I have done several procedures in other places but this is my favorite place and dr Jafari is very knowledgeable on how to make you look younger! Also the staff is very friendly.<//review>

Love this place! Dr. Jafari is super nice, professional, and knowledgeable about fillers. Get filler done here 1-2 times per year and love my results. Prices are really good! I plan to return for some of her amazing skin care treatments and more filler in 6 months!!< /review>

I highly recommend Dr. Jafari for filler and Botox shots. I saw her earlier this month for liquid facelift and discussed my desired look and treatments I was interested in. I did my Botox on the same day and was very happy with the results, so I decided to go ahead with her recommended fillers (juvederm Voluma for my cheeks and Volbella for tear troughs). Great results with natural look I wanted. I love how she was able to take out my dark circles and give my face a nice subtle lift without making it look overfilled. So happy and highly recommended!<//Text>

<review>I just moved here back in March and found Amoderm on yelp! They have amazing reviews and a great instagram page so I made an appointment. Josephine greeted me, gave me gloves and took my temperature. She also did all my Brilliant Distinctions for me. She was very sweet and answered all my questions and made me comfortable. Then I met Dr. Jafari, OMG I love her! She was so kind and so gentle and NO bruises from filler! The Botox was perfect and lasted a long time. She has a gentle touch and she won't oversell she literally will do what is needed. I came in for me touch up today and I only needed Botox, she said my filler is still great! That made me happy, so if you are looking for somewhere new, I highly recommend this place!
Thank you to the kind staff!</review>< pics>

<review>I have been coming to Dr. Jafari since last year when I was concerned with preventative Botox and the on set of early signs of wrinkles. She is a professional who never wants to make her patients spend more than they need and at our initial consultation she told me I could wait to start Botox but if I wanted to do preventative to make me happy she would do the lowest amount of units allowed. It’s nice to find a licensed professional that cares so deeply about their patients and their pockets! She is so gentle and always answers any questions or concerns I have in full detail. I can’t say enough about her kind staff and their precautions during covid-19, I feel safe and the office is impeccably clean! I 10/10 recommend coming her for all your cosmetic needs! The hydrofacial is incredible too!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Dr. Jafari is the best and I'm always happy with her work and she knows what she's doing. She's very knowledgeable about the face and never does too much. She always listens what I want and gives me her best professional opinion. She always does everything naturally and she's very sweet and kind. She takes her time every time she talks to me and is thorough with her injections and techniques. I highly recommend her to anyone and you will always leave happy!< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I saw Dr. Jafari for acne scars on my face (mostly on cheeks and some on forehead) and as per her recommendations, did 3 session of fractional CO2 laser. Both my nurses were excellent as I truly enjoyed the experience. As for the treatment, there wasn't much discomfort with numbing and I experienced some redness and mild swelling after the lasers (more after the first one, I guess my skin got used and adjusted to it). . All instructions were pretty clear and easy to follow. There were 2 creams to apply, one right after the treatment to keep the skin protected and the other one before and between the treatments to reduce skin darkening for better results. I also had to wash my face gently over the first few days. Overall not that bad. Now the great part: I am glad to report that my scars are noticeably better after completing the 3 sessions. They are not completely gone (and I didn't really expected that and Dr. Jafari also told me about it ahead of time), but I am happy with the improvements so far and will most likely try a few more sessions later on. Dr. Jafari also recommended I do Bellafill for a few larger scars and that's also my plan once I am done with the lasers since the laser seems to be working good for me. Altogether I am happy and grateful to Dr. Jafari and my nurses!</Review>< Pics>

I was checked in quickly, provided a detailed consultation, and I am excited to see the results (again - second visit!).

I’ve been going to Amoderm for over a year now and I’ve always had a positive experience. The dr is obviously very knowledge and competent and I always feel like I’m in good hands.

I was a little hesitant making an appointment during Covid-19 but the office takes safety very seriously and the whole staff is in masks and gloves. They also require patients wear gloves and provide them upon arrival, which made me feel extra safe.

I would highly recommend Amoderm to anyone!<//Text>

Dr. Jafari is the only person I let touch my face! I originally came to her back in 2017(?)  By way of realself. I looked at a lot of other injectors in the area, and she has an impressive education backing her. To address my hollow under eyes. I have to come to her ever since. She is kind, friendly, professional and isn't pushy with new suggestions or offerings. Her staff is very friendly as well.<//Review>

I came here a year ago for Botox and loved my results. With Covid and quarantining, I wasn’t able to come back until today. Great office experience. They are very diligent with Covid protocols. Mandatory masks, they give you gloves to wear when you walk in, and have air purifiers in every room. I felt safe the whole time. Dr. Jafari is wonderful. She doesn’t push any treatments on you, rather gives her honest opinion. I will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

I have very good results at Amoderm. They always assess my needs well and the treatments give me confidence. The staff is kind and virtuous. The Doctor takes her time to really assess my desires and is honest about what works best for my features and the results I want. Thank you so much! A very satisfied customer!</Review>

I have come to Amoderm a hand full of times now and always have a great experience. Dr. Elham Jafari is great and both she and her staff always makes sure to ask how my family and mom is doing, since we both come here together! They are very honest and make sure not to over do any procedures. I’ve heard stories of doctors telling patients all the different things that are needed. However, I enjoyed that in my first consultation she simply asked me what I would like to do. My Botox always looks very natural and I highly recommend this clinic to anyone.< /text>

<Review>Over the past 2-3 years I have lasered most parts of my body at Amoderm and it has become by goto place for lasers. My skin is a bit of olive toned, and their lasers work great on me. Saw almost complete results in my legs, arms, tummy, back and chest after the recommended 6 sessions. For my bikini and under arms, I had been told that hormone might cause some new hair growth but I still saw a good 70-80% hair reduction, which was still better than I expected after 6 rounds and have done 3 more touch ups. Again, all in line with what they had told me. Dr. Jafari is very nice and always helpful and both my nurses have been super friendly and easy to work with. Thanks God I am no longer in need of shaving and waxing. A big plus and completely worth it!</Review><GmapID>0x80dcdd69f39d7cd1:0x67cf1466d7a3e1f6</GmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I always enjoy my experience at amoderm. I come from Murrieta just to get my Botox done because I feel confident in the care I will be receiving here. I also love the results and can always guarantee that what I am getting will turn out great. I also love how I am in and out quickly. The staff is very friendly, as well!<//Text>

Dr. Jafari is the absolute best in treating dark circles under eyes with fillers and I trust no other one. As someone with chronic hollows under eyes since very young age, she was the one who was able to help me with her masterful filler injections in my tear troughs and under eyes and cheeks. I followed her recommended procedure (4D lift) and got Volbella under eyes and Voluma in cheeks and love the results. The cheek filler gave me a very nice and prominent lift and even helped with reducing laugh lines while the volbella under eyes took care of the dark circles. All done with cannula for almost no pain! Great results and absolutely highly recommended!< /review>

Dr. Jafari was super nice and recommended Ultherapy for my face and neck. My nurse was equally nice and she seemed to be quite thorough in performing the treatment (I did 2 passes as recommended). Right after the treatment I had very mild redness (temporary) and nothing else. As Dr. Jafari had explained during my consultation, the treatment works by stimulating new collagen which is a slow and gradual process so I was ready to wait for a while and indeed, I started noticing improvements from my third month. It has helped a lot with my crepey skin and has made my face and neck skin noticeably firmed. The sagginess specially in jowls and neck is much less. I highly recommend Dr. Jafari and my nurse at Amoderm!<//Review>

I am very pleased with the lip treatment I received from Dr. Jafari. My lips are a bit on the thin side so I have been doing lip fillers for quite some time. When I moved to California, I had to put it hold for almost 2 years so I was pretty desperate for a touch up and  started searching for a new doctor and found Dr. Jafari thanks to her raving reviews. I went to see her for a consultation and was very impressed by her knowledge and her straight forward attitude - she examined my lips and said I didn't need more than a syringe. As she suggested, I got Volbella. She had a very light hand and I almost didn't feel a thing with numbing and had zero bruising other than a few small red dots. The swelling was pretty minimal at first but I got pretty swollen up next day (again nothing I didn't expect) and it all went away by the forth day. By the 2nd week, I could really start to appreciate the beauty of her work and the fillers settled and swelling was completely gone. Very nice and natural pout. Loving it ❤️<//Text>

Every time I come to Amoderm I'm so impressed with the level of service and kindness I'm met with! The front desk and entire staff have always made me feel so welcome the minute I walk in :) Dr. Jafari also reflects that same warmth and kindness! I've never felt pressured into a service, and have always come away looking natural from my results! If you're in the area and need a new place for beauty treatments, come here!!</review>

<text>Dr. Jafar is amazing. Her office is gorgeous and staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I have been going to her for a few years now for Botox and lip injections. I like that she always listen to what I want and provides me with fantastic service. I appreciate that she is conservative with her procedures and I leave her office looking nature but enhanced. Her Botox injections last me between 6-8 months, which is great. Her work makes my face look younger and more rejuvenated without looking over the top or cartoonish. In addition, I love that she is always offering deals and discounts to help modify the cost, making face enhancement more reasonable. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my experience and will continue coming to Dr. Jafar for all of my cosmetic needs< /text>< pics>

<Review>Felt very safe coming in. They took temperature, used a tablet, limited seating and made everyone wear gloves and masks. I can already see the improvements from last time. The Botox lasts almost 6 months before you start slightly seeing wrinkle lines forming again. Would recommend trying it out and it is safe during this time.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>I found Doctor Elham back in 2019 on Yelp and I must say she’s amazing. She’s very honest about your procedure and does a great job with everything. My Botox lasted so long and the price is totally worth it.
The office is very clean, very nice staff and they all follow covid safety procedures. I have recommended Dr jafari to my friends and family and I will definitely be back here again.<//review><name>El Naz< /name>< Resp>

I have enjoyed coming to Amoderm. This is my 3rd time at the office. I had filler and Botox done twice and I’ve had CO2 fractional laser done once. My experience at 3 visits have been great! Everyone is professional and friendly. I look forward to more visits.</text>

I am so impressed with Amoderm. Dr. Jafari is wonderful to work with- so professional and knowledgeable, and she immediately puts you at ease. The facility is super clean with all safety protocols firmly in place during COVID-19. Masks required, gloves provided, my temperature was taken, and there are air filters everywhere. I am very cautious about everything during this pandemic and this place felt very safe.<//review>

I have received several types of treatments over the past year and a half. I appreciate the staff walking me through the treatment options so that I can choose the best one for me. I have been very pleased with my results. The staff is very professional and friendly. Wait time has never been more than 10 minutes. I also like the personal calls to remind me of my upcoming appointment.</Text>

After my pregnancy, I ended up with some severe stretch marks on my tummy and flanks and went to Amoderm for a consultation. They discussed how CO2 fractional laser can help rebuild collagen to make the texture of skin smoother. Dr.  Jafari recommended that I start with 3 laser sessions which I did and it’s been 3 months since the last session and I can see clear improvements. They had told me that I might need more sessions and I am waiting for the clinic to open again to go back and continue with the treatment to hopefully make it even better. All my Amoderm nurses were nice and professional.</Text>

<Text>I love coming to Amoderm for my Botox treatments. Dr. Jafari always consults with me prior to treatment and I’m able to ask questions about new treatments that I’m interested in. The per unit prices of Botox are great compared to other providers I saw in the past, and they generously offer quantity discounts once you get to a certain threshold. I’ve also had microneedling done and loved the results... I’d do that quarterly if I could afford to!

Also wanted to share that they have very safe COVID practices in effect right now, limiting lobby seating, quickly moving patients to treatment rooms, and use of gloves and masks. I am pleased with my experiences and will continue to visit Amoderm for my skincare needs!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Desirae Hennessey<//name>< rating>

<Text>I've been coming to Amoderm for almost two years and I'm very content with the service and treatment here. All the staff are pleasant and accommodating. I really appreciate Dr Jafari because she is honest and direct in her assessments. She also is not in the business to give you as many treatments as possible just to earn money. I asked about lip fillers and she assured me I didn't need them. She understands my desire to enhance natural beauty and not be too overdone. I will continue to see Dr. Jafari for the foreseeable future!</Text>< Pics>

From very young age my "skeleton hands" bothered me to the point of wearing gloves on my wedding day. I always followed healthy diet and stayed fit but the look of my hands was so bad that I even tried putting on weight to make my hands look better. Unfortunately it didn't help much. So I was so happy to hear about hand rejuvenation and saw Dr. Jafari. She injected Radiesse into the back f my hands (2 syringes on each side) and it really helped a lot with adding the much needed volume and hiding the blood veins and tendons a bit! I also did 3 session of erbium laser skin resurfacing the reduce the sun spots on my hands and it also helped tremendously. I am glad that my hands now look age-appropriate for me an not 25 years older than me!!</text>

<review>Amoderm is my one-stop shop for all things skincare and cosmetic. From Botox to fillers to liquid rhinoplasty, they never fail to make me feel comfortable in my own skin while enhancing my natural features. Dr. Jafari and team are so well skilled and trained - they will always ensure the patient is well informed with procedures/costs/follow up care etc. Thank you Amoderm!!

Great help with my sun spots! After years in sun (only have myself to blame for nor protecting my skin), I developed several brown spots on my cheeks and forehead. Dr. Jafari did erbium micro laser peel and it helped a lot! I would say the first session took care of maybe 5-10℅ of the sun spots but the 2nd and specially the 3rd sessions did the trick and my freckles are much better now. Recommended!</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I have to say I was very wary of any of these types of facial procedures, including Botox or fillers. I had deep pockets under my eyes and was afraid to have anyone insert any needles in such a sensitive area. However, Dr. Jafari has a magic touch and truly made such a difference on me. She also listened in that I wanted a natural look with respect to my Botox and recommended Dysport. When I did it, it was so natural, but also friends noticed a refreshed, beautiful look. She listens and that's what matters. I have sent more than 4 of my good friends here and they are all happy with their procedures.  You will not be disappointed. Additionally, their Covid procedures are top notch with filters in each room and full screening and sanitization.  If you're looking to have something done and look refreshed, this is truly, truly the place.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Wonderful experience. Did my cheek and under eye filler for eye bags and dark circles with Dr. Jafari and so happy with the results. I opted to do her recommended 4D eye lift with volbella for tear troughs and voluma in cheeks and the I just can't say enough how happy I am. Very natural and balanced look just as wanted. By the way, the staff are very helpful and I was impressed by all the safety measures they have for Covid. They gave me gloves whenever giving me something to sign and everyone was masked. All rooms had air sanitizers and more. Very impressed!< /Review>< Pictures>

Found Amoderm on yelp and have been coming here for a almost a year for Botox.  Things that i love:
1)  they are professional always nice and happy
2)  it feels like I'm going to a spa and it's my me time away from the kids and hubby
3) not once have I ever felt pressured, or bullied into getting more than what I have asked for or brought up as an area of concern for me.  This is HUGE!!! I've had friends go in for Botox at other places and have come out with complexes about issues not even previously on their radar.

I really love this place and drive 32 miles to come every few months!<//Text>

Dr Jafari is a professional in her field. She listens and makes the appropriate recommendations based off individual needs. I spent little to no time waiting and was in and out quickly. I am big on making appointments online and these guys are always accommodating to my schedule and allow me to do it via email. Definitely recommend!<//Text>

I've been coming here for years, and just visited for the first time since COVID, they have been extremely clean and safe. Dr. Jafari is conservative and a master at what she does. I don't trust anyone else with my Botox and fillers.</Text>

Took an impulsive try at chin filler and loved the results; she made sure my preferences were in check and provided a comfortable experience. The whole treatment was probably no longer than 5 minutes. Would definitely recommend this doctor for future treatments in the aesthetics :D< /Review>

Love it here! The staff is super friendly, clean rooms, relaxing atmosphere! I have had several things done-filler and Botox and have been very satisfied with the results. Dr. Jafari is amazing-she consults with you about all concerns and takes her time with each client. I will definitely continue to get my touch ups here! I highly recommend this place-plenty of parking and easy to get to.</review>

Beautiful office with a real doctor who does the injections and she has a speciality in muscles, not some nurse like a lot of other places. The doc reviews all your past pics and notes before she sees you again and can suggest what and what not to do. I really trust her as she is quite conservative. The office is open one Saturday a month which is really helpful.</text>

I have done Venus Freeze at Amoderm and have seen good results overall. My main concern was the cellulite on buttocks and back of thighs and after doing 6 sessions of Venus Freeze, the skin was much tighter and better toned and the cellulite was much better. I started to noticed the results after the 3rd/4th session so this is a treatment that needs adherence to the recommended series of 6 sessions (or possibly more) but on the plus side, it is relatively inexpensive and it is completely pain-free so I highly recommend it! Dr. Jafari and her staff at Amoderm were very helpful and I have always had a pleasant experience at Amoderm.< /text>

< Review>
I have done Ultherapy at Dr. Jafari's office for my eyebrows, lower face/jawline and neck all with very good results. My initial concern was fine lines around the eyes and some loose skin on the neck but as I consulted Dr. she indicated that I can be a good candidate for Ultherapy and so I decided to do more areas and am so happy that I did. Ultherapy is a pretty thorough and targeted treatment that focuses on stimulating collagen so it's supposed to work gradually with lasting results and I can attest to that so far. I had the treatment a little over 9 months ago and it took me around 8-9 weeks to start noticing first results (best seen in serial pictures) in my eyebrows and crows feet. The jawline and neck were a bit behind but I could see clear improvements in about 3 months and I think I got to the peak at around 6 months. I guess the key is to remain patient since it's your own body that is working to make the new collagen and if you give it the time in needs, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Dr. Jafari and her nurses at Amoderm are very nice and supportive and I always felt well taken care of working with them. Great experience!< /Review>

<Review>I just wanted to drop by and write a quick review about Amoderm. I dont really ever write reviews but this place is the best! They have the nicest staff, who are always so welcoming, the wait is never long, and the office is super clean. Dr Jafari does a wonderful job with my botox, I’ve been coming here for over a year now and will continue forever! Also if you are worried about covid 19, they are taking great precaution! Masks, gloves, one patient at a time, air filters, etc. highly recommend this place!!< /Review><time>1589482544381< /time></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Jafari is very knowledgeable and always makes me feel comfortable admit I was nervous about getting injections but she is so good at what she did that it’s actually a pleasant experience.

<text>I did nonsurgical chin augmentation with Dr. Jafari and highly recommend her. I have been struggling with a small and receding chin since teenage years and always dreaded of my picture being taken from the sideway lol! It almost became a second nature for me to always try to face people straight and this whole thing was undermining my self-confidence a lot. I saw pictures of Dr. Jafari’s patients on her Instagram gallery and went it for a consult and decided to do the Voluma injection in my chin. The pain was not that bad and the injection was done pretty quickly, but the result is amazing. No more hiding from camera!< /text><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My sister referred me to Dr Jafari at Amoderm. I am a longtime user of fillers and Botox and have tried many doctors but Dr J’s holistic approach was amazing. At her consult she analyzed my whole face and gave practical recommendations on what to do for most natural look. I did Voluma and Volbella at cheeks and under eyes with fabulous results. Also did my regular Botox for forehead and the lines disappeared while I still have my natural expression and there is certainly no frozen look! I do like her conservative approach and she is upfront and honest. Outstanding skill and technique, and lovely personality. What’s not to love about her! Great doctor!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

After my first Botox appointment at Amoderm, I knew Dr. Jafari and her team would be my go to! She walked me through the process and made me feel so comfortable. I trusted her decision with the amount of units I would need and my forehead has never looked better! :)

< review>
Did my 3rd laser for acne scars on my face 2 months ago and I can give an accurate account now. I have been suffering from scars mostly on my cheeks since teenage years and tried many creams to no avail so I decided to go for the laser treatment. Dr. Jafar recommended 3 sessions of fractional CO2 laser to start. I did use the prep cream for around 2 weeks to get my skin ready for laser and did the treatment after numbing cream (provided by the office). I can tell that the laser was pretty intensive and I had noticeable redness for the next few days. I followed the instructions closely with the healing cream and soaks, etc and was careful not to pull at my skin. As my skin healed and a couple of weeks passed I could see some improvements which encouraged me to continue with the remaining 2 sessions and I am glad I did as my skin got better after each round. I highly recommend going for a couple of rounds as 1 session is usually not enough. Also following the clinic instructions after each laser session is critical to make sure healing is quick and complete. Based on my experience I can recommend fractional CO2 laser for acne scars and I do recommend Amoderm as a great clinic to get this treatment.< /review>

Their lasers work! I have completed a full body laser hair removal package and I can confirm that the lasers at Amoderm do great job for the most part. Both my nurses were very good and helpful and made sure my treatments were thorough and as comfortable as possible. I also had no problem whatsoever scheduling appointments and I loved it that the clinic was always very organized and I hardly ever remember falling behind my appointment. The prices are also very good for the quality they offer and I saved more by going for a full body package and got 6 months no interest payment plan. Very good experience at an affordable price.</Text>

Came to Dr Jafari for Botox and she took the time to patiently explain the procedure for me. She also went through how the muscles work and where she would inject as well as recommended how much I would need. Once we went over everything, she even opened the Botox in front of me so I knew exactly what she was using! I absolutely loved my results!! She heard exactly what I needed and left me looking natural. I’ve also been in her office for laser and had the best nurse for my procedure! Her staff is always friendly and helpful.</review>

<text>Dr Jafari is AMAZING! This review is long overdue. After going to multiple doctors all over the OC area, I finally found a doctor for a all of my cosmetic needs. I could not be more pleased with Dr Jafari and the Amoderm team. She is honest, professional and knowledgeable. She also makes her patients feel very comfortable and takes the time to really explain the process and recommendations. My filler and Botox, and facial treatments have never looked more natural. I will continue to come back for all of my cosmetic needs. Highly recommend< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd69f39d7cd1:0x67cf1466d7a3e1f6< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great office. I've been coming to doctor Jafari's office for a few years both botox and fillers and I couldn't been any more happier. She is an excellent doctor who is very experienced, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. She really does care about her patients and she always make sure that all of her patients are happy. I totally recommend doctor Jafari to everyone. Once you go to her, you will never go to anyone else.</Review>

Came in here a few times and have always been satisfied with my experience. The staff delivers world class service and knows what it means to go the extra mile. The space is warm, inviting and friendly. You never feel pushed or like your being pitched a line, so it makes it comfortable. The Doctor has an amazing eye for aesthetics and delivers exactly what she says she will. I can't rave about this place enough!<//Text>

I absolutely love Amoderm! I come for Botox and am getting help treating my TMJ as well! It's great because Dr Jafari does all the Botox so you feel safer than when a nurse does it at a clinic. Also, I started coming for Lazer vein removal for broken capillaries. I've had one on my chest that's been here forever I wanted to get removed before my wedding. I did one treatment and it was entirely gone! I've been back for a second treatment for capillaries as well and the results are truly incredible and life changing. Thank you so much for the results!!</Review>

I have gone to Amoderm for laser treatments and have nothing but praise for them. Everything in this clinic sends a clear message that they are here to help their clients. They are very responsive on phone or email and making appointment is ridiculously easy. The consultation I had also left a very positive impression on me as I could clearly see that they were really interested in figuring out how to best help me versus just pushing me to buy buy buy! Everyone from the front girls to the nurses to Dr. Jafari are very sweet and helpful and I always feel welcomed when I go to Amoderm.

<text>Just completed my 6 sessions of Venus freeze for cellulite for whole thighs and saggy skin under my upper arms. The skin under my arks is much tighter and nicer and I can wear short sleeves with confidence again. As for the cellulite, I wasn’t expecting a miracle but I am glad that the areas look much better – 50-60% at least – and I am encouraged to continue with more sessions. As for the clinic, they are super friendly and easy to work with and I never had any issues scheduling my appointment or seeing nurses and all my nurses were great.</text><Name>Adrienne Pavone<//Name><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd69f39d7cd1:0x67cf1466d7a3e1f6< /Gmap_id><rate>5< /rate>< pics>

I found Amoderm based on reviews and they live up to the hype. Super professional, calm, not pushy at all. From the front desk staff to the doctor herself, everyone is kind and helpful. It was my first experience with botox and so much easier than I could have imagined. I’ve been back a few times and they have worked with me and how my body has reacted to the botox, without any pushback. I’m very pleased with my results.< /Review>

<Text>I came here for help with my severe acne scars and Dr. Jafari recommended 3 sessions of fractional CO2 laser for my face as well as Bellafill injection for a few deeper scars on my cheeks and around the jaws. I did the fillers first (2 rounds) and it helped tremendously. CO2 laser was a more gradual treatment and the improvement after the first session was quite subtle but the 2nd and specially the 3rd round did the trick and I was very happy to see great improvements. I will be going back for a few more sessions to hopefully see even better results. As an added bonus, the laser also helped a lot with shrinking the large pores and I fill my skin is a lot better toned and has a better texture. The laser treatment itself was not that painful (with topical numbing) and the postop was not as bad as I had heard (mostly redness and a bit of swelling with all those tiny dots which laser had punched on my skin!) Most issues were gone within ten days. I also used a brightening cream which according to Dr. helped with allowing them to go higher with laser energy and also reduced the risk of pigmentation (I didn't experience any noticeable pigmentation).<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Jafari and did chin augmentation and Jawline contouring with Voluma and it was well worth the cost as she was able to give my receding chin as well as undefined jaw lines a very nice and natural prominence and contour. So funny and a great relief as I am no longer afraid of a picture of me from sides!! I also did Ultherapy to further lift the neck and so far (a few months after the first treatment) it seems to be working fine and I can feel and see that my neck skin is firmer and more lifted.

Dr. Jafari injected Voluma in my cheeks and Volbella under my eyes and in the tear troughs as part of her signature 4D under eye lift procedure and the results are beyond satisfactory. I have had filler under eyes elsewhere before but it ended up creating a puffy look and I hated it, so I went to Dr. Jafari and asked her to remove it which she did and after a few months when I felt I was ready for it again, I went back to her and she did the injections for me. What a huge difference! Filler under eyes requires great skills and makes all the sense to go and see the absolute best of the best to make sure you don't end up like me with my first experience. I am glad to have found Dr. Jafari and I recommend her for fillers specially for cheeks and under eyes (4D lift). Btw the clinic is very well appointed and I never had long waits or other problems I commonly seen at other places. High recommended.< /text>

Hands down, Doctor Jafari is the most talented doctor I've ever met in this field. She has magical hands and she is a genuine person .office staff are very nice and friendly and there is not a single thing that one can complain about. The best part is, all you need is gathered under one roof with the best quality! Thank you Amodern team!< /review>

<Review>I had my dark circles treated at skillful hands of Dr. Jafari and I am truly impressed. She is clearly an expert for filler placements under eyes and I trust no other one. I followed her recommendation to do 2 syringes of Volbella under eyes and 2 syringes of Voluma for my cheeks (under her 4D under eye lift procedure) and it all came out perfectly. I do bruise easily and it was no exception this time but nothing terrible and it was gone within days. Swelling is another story, as it really got me scared and I thought my eyes had become puffy and worse but in all fairness Dr. Jafari had warned me about the swelling beforehand. Sure enough, within a week it was all good and even the few remaining lumps where completely gone within the recommended 2 weeks and I was all good! I am getting many compliments on how refreshed I look and this is for sure the best money I spent on cosmetic treatments and I highly recommend her.<//Review>< time>

I have done jaw slimming with DR. Jafari and she did an excellent job. I had done it with her here before with Botox last year (around 35 units on each side) and it made my face much nicer and slimmer and also helped with my TMJ a lot. Second time I did it with Newtox (Jeuveau) which was my first time but it worked just as good, while saving me a bit. I have been more careful not chewing gum so I guess that's also helping a bit but the treatments from Dr. Jafari did the trick and I am very happy with the results. Btw the first time I did it I think it lasted a good 6 months or so (harder to notice on face as you get use to it, but I could tell with my TMJ being much better) and I'm hoping the 2nd time will work just as long. I also did Voluma injection for chin augmentation and a bit of it done in my jawlines for a complete makeover and I am very pleased with everything. Definitely recommend Dr. Jafari for injections!< /Text>

I highly recommend Dr Jafari, she is a great doctor. It’s my second time coming back here and I could not be more happier with the results. She always takes her time talking to you first to make sure she understands what results you are looking to achieve. I also recommend her to my friends for any derma fillers or Dysport injections. Definitely will come back again.</Text>

<Text>Just completed my Hydrafacial at amoderm and absolutely love it! My esthetician was so good and the hydra facial was out of this world!! My skin feels so refreshed and hydrated and I love the nice overall glow it have me. I had heard about it but was on fence as I wanted to make sure to get it from a reputable clinic and when I heard amoderm was offering it and they had a special for first-time, I jumped on it. Hydrafacial is a great comprehensive treatment on its own but I also added Dermabuilder booster which is supposed to further help with fine lines and wrinkles as well as the perk treatment for closer work on eyes and I highly recommend it to all. The Amderm office itself is nice and organized and the staff are very helpful. Dr. Jafari is also very friendly and I completely trust her recommendations and owe her a great part of my good skin and rejuvenated look!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Love this place! This is my third visit and I've been so impressed every time that Dr. Jafari remembers me, remembers my Botox dose from before and is very thoughtful about what she wants to do. She asks me if I have concerns but never tries to force other treatments on me, but when I've asked about them she's very clear about what would be useful to me versus what wouldn't. I was hesitant to do Botox at all initially but am so glad that I came here. Totally recommend. The staff is also great.</review>

< review>
Thanks to Dr. Jafari and Amoderm I got my lips back (and it's not just a lip service!) I was unlucky to have lips that were disproportionately thin and for year I had to reply on makeup to make it look normal. I knew about lip fillers but never wanted to take the risk and end up with an exaggerated look and duck lips. I came to know Dr. Jafari through the review site and saw her patient pictures which looked quite natural and decided to book an appointment. I found her to be a great listener who fully understood my concerns and she assured me that she rarely does more than a syringe of lip filler for any patients at a time anyway and it's always possible to add more later. So I went ahead with one syringe of Juvederm Volbella and the result far exceeded my expectations. Sure enough, I was back a few weeks later for a second syringe and I couldn't be happier. I love my lips! Dr. Jafari also noted that I had dry skin and lips and provided me with some advice to help with that. I also did a Hydrafacial with Perk for lips which gives and extra boost and hydration to face and lips and I am doing it on monthly basis. After years of neglect, I am glad to be taking care of my face and lips and thank you Dr. Jafari for all your help!< /review>

<Review>Long-time client and first time reviewer of Amoderm! I have been doing laser hair removal for pretty much all over my body (started from arm pits and got sucked into it!). It’s quite addictive as you the hair becomes less and less and you don’t need to worry much about shaving and all. Later on I lasered the stretch marks behind my legs and calves. They used CO2 laser on my legs for 3 rounds and my legs look much better. I had white and purple striae and they responded pretty good.</Review>< username>

<time>1567030249090< /time><text>I went to DR. Jafari for bags and deep circles under my eyes and underwent the 4D under eye lift procedure with her. It's basically fillers under eyes and cheeks but she uses her own specific technique which is supposed to make it look nicer and more natural with fillers injected in different layers and from my own experience, I can vouch for her approach and her skills and the results came out great! She used Volbella for under eyes and voluma for my cheeks and used the cannula injection method. I am very happy and recommends Dr. Jafari and her 4D lift procedure to anyone looking to get rid of dark circles under eyes.<//text>< GmapID>

I have completed 2 sessions of sculpsure at Amoderm to get rid of the stubborn fat around my belly button.  I’m happy to report that the size of the belly has gone down noticeably and it’s better toned. I think I still need to do one more session for my perfect desired look. Love this place. Friendly and caring staff. Honest doctor.

Thanks!<//text>

<text>Super happy with my experience! Dr. Jafari is very nice and she is the best with fillers! I have had my cheeks and laugh lines injected by her and she used Juvederm voluma and the lines are almost completely gone and barely noticeable. I love how the result looks so natural and it gave me a great boost in confidence as I was worried with early development of deep folds around my mouth. The injections were almost painless (I had numbing) and I had no bruising and very mild swelling. Ever since my visit, I have referred two of my friends to her (one for lip injections and one for botox) and they also have nothing but praise for her work. I trust no one other than Dr. J for fillers!<//text><rate>5<//rate>< Name>

I am super happy with Co2 fractional lasers. I have several acne scars from my youth that bothered me all the time. After spending so much time in researching ,  I chose Amoderm. I had 3 sessions of Co2 fractional laser so far and I can not be happier with my result. My scars has  been improved and  my skin texture looks definitely better. Very nice, friendly and professional staff. Very knowledgeable  doctor.<//Review>

I love this cosmetic office.
I got to know Doctor Jafari  years and she has always been the same... kind, patience, helpful, and very intelligent and well informed. Once you step in her office she will make sure that she takes the best care of you and answer all your questions.
I did all my hair laser in this office and it was amazing. Not only that, I always had a problem with my nose and I really didn’t like it. I went in for a free consultation with Doctor Jafari and she recommend to do filler which I had no idea about. I ended up getting Voluma in my nose and it was the best decision. This was back in 2015 and I still have the filler in my nose. It looks very natural.
Doctor Jafari knows what she is doing. She never does too little or too much because she knows how to give you the best result. She can do injection with her eyes closed... that’s how great she is.
I always recommend Doctor Jafari to people especially to those who always wanted to get fillers but they were scared because she is the best at what she does and you will be happy with ur result and what see :)< /text>

Dr Jafari is an absolute artiste. I have done some injections at Amoderm and I really love my result. She is nice and honest and does not recommend you any unnecessary procedure. My result is very natural and subtle and my face is really balanced.  I love the contouring of my cheek. From now on I only go back to her. Do not waste your time shopping around.<//Review>

My favorite place of all! I have been come to this place for multiple times to get injectables and referred several friends to come here as well. They all love it! Dr.Jafari is such a professional and responsible doctor. She does not recommend more than needed in order to rip money off you.(like several others cosmetics centers). When I suggested a little Kybella for my not-so-prominent-double chin, she literally said don’t be so hard on yourself, you are so pretty already, you don’t need it. What a wonderful doctor. I’ll definitely keep coming here for nonsurgical procedures. Thank you Dr. jafari.<//text>

Did fractional CO2 laser skin resurfacing for pretty severe acne scarring since several years ago. I had some redness after each session which lasted for a few days and used brightening creams before each laser session. The results: my skin tone and texture is markedly improved and the acne scarring is much less noticeable. I highly recommend Amoderm for acne scar treatments. Dr. Jafari is very helpful and all the nurses I worked with were very nice and did great.<//review>

A big thank you to Dr. Jafari and the rest of the team at Amoderm in Irvine for great service all around. The laser treatment on my face worked as I had hoped and it was highly effective. I just can’t say enough about the great experience I have had at Amoderm - from the ease of making appointment on phone, through their website or by email to the minimal wait time upon arrival and a staff that is always ready to help, not to mention the treatments that work without breaking the bank!!</review>

Dr. Jafari and her nurses are the best! Nice clinic and very organized.  They are very communicative and answer phone right away or call/email back right away if they miss any call. I highly recommend this cosmetic clinic.< /Review>

Excellent service, awesome doctor, Ive come here for about 6 months now and every time I come in there alway very friendly and always very helpful in understanding questions I may have on fillers or Botox. Getting an appointment is rather easy as well a week to a week in a half then I'm seen. Wait is to minimum and the visit is always very quick and and very satisfying with the results. Would highly recommend!<//Review>

<review>Did chin filler injection with Dr. Jafari and I am very happy with my experience. My weak receding chin wasn’t really proportional to the rest of my face and it always made me self conscious to the point that I always tried to speak with other holding my face straight toward them to avoid anyone seeing me from the side. I was considering chin implants until I heard about the nonsurgical option and went to see Dr. Jafari. She recommended 2syringes of Voluma but left it to me to decide on the pace and so I did one syringe first and as I saw the great improvement, went back for the second Voluma syringe a few weeks later. I still cannot believe the great impact of such a simple and relatively inexpensive procedure and I only wish I knew about it and Dr. Jafar sooner rather than waiting all these years trying to hide my receding chin… Absolutely the best decision and highly recommended!<//review>< resp>

I’ve been coming here regularly for a year now.  Dr. Jafari knows what she’s doing.  She doesn’t push services or treatments that aren’t needed.  Her prices are comparable to the market.  Friendly staff at the clinic.< /Review>

< Review>
Love getting my laser hair removal done at Amoderm! I've done 2 sessions so far, one with Dhara and one with Robyn. Both are professional, gentle, and make me feel as comfortable as possible. Since beginning my laser hair removal treatments, my hair has thinned and barely grows back!! I don't have to deal with razor bumps or burns anymore and I barely stop to think about needing to shave anymore. Dr. Jafari is also extremely knowledgeable, kind, and professional and always explains anything I have questions about. I will definitely go to her if and when I ever decide to do any injections.< /Review>

I saw Dr. Jafari for liquid rhinoplasty back in Feb and just got a chance to write about it here. The office is very nice and clean and scheduling an appointment was quite easy. Dr. Jafari is very nice and she is very skillful in fillers and Botox. She recommended voluma for my nose to fix the little bump I had. I am very happy with the results and the bump is almost completely gone. I know it's not supposed to be a permanent solution and nonsurgical nose job will need to be redone as filler goes away but going with VOluma I hope it is going to last me a good year or two. No matter what, when the filler is gone I make sure to be back to see DR. Jafari for more filler as I know she is the best for filler and I hate doing the surgery!!< /Review>

This review is way over due. Dr. Jafari literally saved my life by correcting a botched filler injection under my eyes that I had done at a well done plastic surgeon office. She is highly experienced in filler injections for under the eyes and tear trough and she was able to fix the dark circles and bags I had under my eyes for years. I had very minimal bruising and swelling but the main thing is that I absolutely love the results.</text>

I am post 3rd session of CO2 fractional laser for my fine lines and wrinkles and acne scars. I love the improved tone and texture of my skin after the treatment. My pores look tighter. Dr Jafari and her consultants are very professional and knowledgeable and the nurses are great. There was no pressure for up selling. I have also started Venus freeze for stubborn cellulite on my thighs and can see improvements already.< /text>

A big thank you to Dr. Jafari and the rest of the team at Amoderm in Irvine for great service all around. The laser treatment on my face worked as I had hoped and it was highly effective. I just can’t say enough about the great experience I have had at Amoderm - from the ease of making appointment on phone, through their website or by email to the minimal wait time upon arrival and a staff that is always ready to help, not to mention the treatments that work without breaking the bank!!<//Review>

<review>When it comes to your face or any cosmetic procedures you have to go to a place that you actually trust.

Dr. Jafari is absolutely amazing. She knows the anatomy of the face and understands what I am trying to acheive when using botox. I never want to come out looking like I have a frozen face and look like Spock from Star Trek with my eyebrows wayyyy arched.

She is extremely professional and conservative. She makes you feel like each time is your first time and evaluates how you feel in terms of what you want done and what you should get done. There is a huge difference. Sometimes people go overboard you know?

Everyone at her office is extremely welcoming, her moisturizers are great for your face and I see her at least every 3 months. She is a damn expert and a true artist. This is your face.... You want to go to a trusted doctor. I highly recommend her.

Thank you Dr. Jafari!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<user_name>Omid Akbari< /user_name><pics>None<//pics><text>Long-term client and first-time reviewer. I have been doing laser hair treatments at Amoderm for over a year and couldn't be happier with the results and my overall experience at Amoderm. I had done tons of research on laser hair removal and had read about different laser machines, and knew I could see better results with YAG lasers. So I started calling up different places nearby and started checking out the ones that offered this type of laser, and I am so glad I found Amoderm. I was impressed by the ease of making appointments and the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. When I saw their doctor and spoke with her, she gave me very helpful advice and I really felt they were more interested in helping me decide what was best for me and not just pushing me to buy. The consult went well and I signed up for a couple of areas at a great price and scheduled my sessions right away. I had my lasers with three of their nurses over the months and have been happy with them all. More importantly, the laser worked amazingly great and most of the hair is gone and not come back. Such a time (and even life) saver! I am so happy for finding Amoderm and have already sent them a couple of friends who all have been equally happy so far. What else can you expect from a top-notch medspa? Definitely check them out!< /text><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

Very pleased with the results of my Bellafill injection by Dr. Jafari at AModerm. I had done microneedling with PRP there before (and it really helped with tone and texture of my skin) but I was looking for a long-term solution to add some volume to my relatively receding chin and also to make my jaw lines more defined and wasn't ready for surgery so I went to see Dr. Jafari and I am so happy. She recommended Voluma and Bellafill and I opted for the 2nd option hoping that it will last longer. Did the allergy test (which came negative) and then she injected one syringe of Bellafill to my chin and 3 more for the jawlines. The treatment was ok and not much painful. Had no bruising but a bit of welling which went away after a few days (no icing needed). While I was happy to see the initial lift, the collagen stimulation part of the filler gave it a much better boost and after almost 4 months, I am even happier with the results (best appreciated when compared with my previous pictures since Dr. Jafari's wok is really natural and she does her best to make sure it "fits" the face as opposed to standing out). I am scheduled to see her again this month to see if she recommend more Bellafill injections, but so far I am very happy.< /Text>

SO very happy with my Botox results! Dr. Jafari is super nice and friendly and she is the best injector I've had. I am a Botox regular at Amoderm (in addition to other works like fractional CO2 laser for acne scars and that's another good experience there) but for Botox I've got it from Dr. Jafari for forehead and eyebrow lift (and she always give me a nice brow lift) as well as the 11 lines between the eyebrows and crows fit. I also did Dysport injection for masseter to size down my jaws a bit and help with my teeth grinding. The experience is always consistent and couldn't be easier. These days Botox is so affordable and the results are so dramatic that there is really no excuse for not getting it from the best of best and for me, that's Dr. Jafari. Couldn't be happier!!< /text>

Everything about this clinic - from their receptionists and

office is nice and

first time I went there I was seen by the doctor
immediately. Dr. Jafari was

<text>After the old place I used to go for getting my hair lasered closed down, I desperately looked around to find a reputable laser clinic and I am glad to find Amoderm. They have a doctor who is always at the clinic and their nurses are very good. The laser is the yag laser which I was looking for as it can treat most skin types. My laser hair removal treatments at Amoderm for underarms, bikini and full legs have been great so far with most of the hair gone and I have nothing but good words to tell about their customer service. Looking back, I only wish I had found them sooner as I could have done all my lasers for full body while saving a bundle and working with great nurses and a real doctor at Amoderm. That’s priceless!<//text>< Pictures>

Anyone considering to have nose surgery for a nose hump should definitely look into liquid nose job. I myself am new to the treatment as  I just did a few weeks ago, but the results far exceeded my expectations. Dr. Jafari did an excellent job in doing the injections around the bump and the nose bridge and I can say my problem is 95% fixed. The best part was that it was a very quick and easy injection and nothing compared with surgery and having to have bandage, etc. I think it’s well worth and I recommend Dr. Jafari for liquid nose job.</Text>

Great laser hair removal treatment especially if you have darker skin tones. After spending several thousands at other places without seeing much result, I signed up for laser treatments at Amoderm as they offer Candela GentleYag lasers which are supposed to work for most skin types including darker tones. Despite my low expectations based on prior experiences, the laser treatment at Amoderm worked way beyond my expectations and I saw significant reduction of hair growth. I had very positive experience at Amoderm and highly recommend them for anyone looking for effective laser hair removal treatments with reasonable prices and by a highly experienced team.</Text>

<text>I have always been upset about the stubborn fat in my belly and my love handles – I really missed having the nice curvature in my 20s. So I signed up for 3 sessions of Sculpsure. So far the results look solid. The treatment is not that painful and it is quite tolerable. I am planning to do 1 more session to get the best result. Amoderm staff are very nice and friendly.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Dr. Jafari was able to help me get rid of the severe eye bags and dark circles I had for years with a single treatment and I am truly grateful to her for her unrivaled skills. For filler injections under eyes, I do not trust anyone else as she is vary gentle with her injections (and she uses cannula which is a big plus) and she does really take her time to make sure the injections are done right. In my case the difference was day and night, but her work is so natural looking that you should look at my pictures before and after doing my treatment to be able to really appreciate it all and it is exactly what I wanted as I was interested in doing some treatments that looks unnatural and show that some works have been done. Dr. Jafari's excellent work fit the bill and I recommend her wholeheartedly! (PS I did Volbella and Voluma for my cheeks and under eyes and both are holding very good).< /Text></record>

<Review>I am very happy with my chin and lip augmentation. The result is very natural and subtle.  My face looks balanced. Dr Jafari is a good listener and never pushes you to the unnecessary treatment. She is very professional and has a light hand. I hardly got any bruise. Love my new improved lips and chins!!</Review>< pics>

"I have been going to Amoderm for several years. I was always happy my result. Dr. Jafari is caring and professional and very nice. I never felt that she was pushing me to do things or rushing me. She is a good listener and a true artist when it comes to injections in the face. I have referred my friends and family to Dr. Jafari and they all have had similar experience and have been equally satisfied. Not to forget that their staff are also really nice and friendly and always trying to help. Very happy to have found them!"<//Text>

I had big and really noticeable stretch marks on my tummy after pregnancy which made my life miserable and prevented me from going to the beach or pool.  I have a couple of laser sessions with fractional laser at Amoderm. The texture of skin has improved significantly and the stretch marks are way better and less noticeable. Dr. Jafari and nurses are really friendly and professional and easy to work with and the clinic is impeccable and easy to access. Highly recommended.<//Review>< Pictures>

I drive quite some distance to do my Botox shots with her and trust no other one. I have been doing Botox for my forehead wrinkles and crows feet for a few years with her and since last year have also been doing masseter injection for jaw slimming. Dr. Jafari's Botox injections have always been right on spot for me and makes the lines go away nicely without making my face look frozen. Love the natural results!< /Review>< user>

After contemplating for so long and trying to find the right Dr. to do my Botox and lip injections I knew that Dr. Jafari was the one. Number one because she is a double board certified Neurologist who knows the face and muscles so well and number two for the fact that her results are extremely subtle. She knows exactly what to inject and just the right amount she did exactly what I envisioned. I had zero pain and was very comfortable during my procedure. The staff and the nurses are amazing! They go above and beyond when explaining the treatment, the hospitality, the patience, and the empathy they provide is beyond any experience I’ve had. I highly recommend Dr. Jafari you won’t regret making your free consultation! I absolutely love this place. ♥️< /text>

< Review>
A friend recommended Dr. Jafari and I schedule a consult with her. We discussed various options for Liquid facelift and I decided to proceed with getting fillers for under eyes, cheeks and a bit on jaw lines (Juvederm Volbella and Voluma). She uses cannula for injections which is a great advantage and my results were very nice and balanced as I wanted. She told me that I can go back after 2 weeks for a follow up just in case any adjustments were needed, but as the swelling went away, everything looked great and no adjustment was necessary. Overall I found her to be very skillful and experienced in fillers and she clearly has great knowledge with fillers. As for the fillers and liquid facelift, I think they are definitely worth it given the nice results without breaking the bank, but do work with someone experienced like Dr. Jafari as I have seen many who have done injections elsewhere and the results were not so great. It’s highly injector-dependent. I recommend Dr. Jafari!<//Review>

< review>
So happy with my fillers and ultherapy with Dr. Jafari/amoderm. After fixing the ugly dark circles under my eyes (which Dr. Jafari did with volbella filler injection), I also had a talk with her about the skin around and above the eyes that was sagging down as well as heaviness around the jaw and lower face and she recommended Ultherapy. Her recommendation was spot on and I got a very nice lift on my eyebrows and the jawline. The treatment was a bit over an hour and they had to numb me and I also opted to take laughing gas which helped a lot and I survived! The pain wasn't terrible but I wouldn't do it without numbing and the gas. Overall very happy.</review>

Highly recommended Medspa and staff including Dr. Jafari who is a gem! I have been a laser hair removal client for over a year and have had excellent response. Also did two rounds of fractional co2 laser for some old acne scars on my cheeks as well as some stretch marks on my back. The scars look much better and I already see some improvements on stretch marks but as they said at my consult, stretch marks might need more sessions. I'm happy so far and do recommend them!<//review>

Happy to review Dr. Jafari and her amazing work. I went to see her for nonsurgical nose job and she skillfully corrected the nose bump I had. Never knew there was any way to fix it other than surgery and I was scared of that, so I thought I just had to accept it and live with it. So glad that I was wrong! Saw her patients’ pictures when browsing online and a few pics of patients who had very similar problem as I caught my eye, so I contacted her office and the rest is history! She used Voluma for my nose so I hope that it will last for a good year or two but regardless, I am so happy with the results and highly recommend this procedure and Dr. Jafari to anyone with similar problem. Btw she also does a great job with Botox and lip fillers as I have personally experienced and cannot praise her work and skills (and warm and lovely personality) enough.</review>

The doctor is the best I have ever experienced for facial treatment she is very knowledgeable and so far with each appointment I have become more beautiful and truly appear younger.  I have tried Botox and Filler so far and have seen her approximately 7 times.  The office is conveniently located it is clean and tidy and the staff is very efficient.  I have never had to wait my appointtare on time and her calendar is easy to book an appointment.  I highly recommend Dr. Jafarimojarrad best doctor ever</text><user>115199077736497020459< /user><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I had to schedule a last minute Botox appointment and was glad that Amoderm accommodated me with a double-booking with Dr. J. They told me that it might take a few minutes extra since her schedule was already fully booked, but I was in and out in less than an hour (and that’s still quicker than the regular appointments I make to see my primary care doc). Definitely impressed by how organized they were (and the Botox worked nicely too!)</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>A truly visionary artist! Dr. Jafari is by far the best cosmetic surgeon I can recommend and I swear by her work. Don’t let her young age deceive you. I know her from 4-5 years ago and know that she has been doing this stuff for many years with a very busy office – an indicator that more and more patients see her work and like it and come to her. I have been doing injections toward the liquid facelift (with botox and different fillers), eye bag treatment, jaw line lift, laugh line removal, and more and what I like about her work is that it always look so natural and inconspicuous in a good way (after the first few days of occasional swelling and bruising). I know it may sound crazy but I do fill happier and more energetic since I got to know her and started doing things. I cannot recommend her enough!</Review>< user_id>

<Text>Extensive research led me to Dr Jafari @Amoderm. My concern was stretch marks on my belly after my pregnancy and went in for a consultation. The staff and Dr. Jafari were very helpful and pretty thorough and I did the fractional Co2 laser (3x so far). I could see some mild improvements after the first treatment but Dr. Jafari recommended that I do at least 3 sessions and I am so glad to follow her as after doing all 3 treatments, my stretch marks are way better and I am planning to do more to make it even better. The treatment is definitely worth it, but as they said, stretch marks are tough to completely remove and you should be ready to do a few sessions to see god results. Btw to complete my mommy makeover, I also did 2 rounds of Sculpsure to get rid of the stubborn baby bump I had and didn’t go away no matter what. Sure enough Sculpsure did the trick!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<name>Emily Wikidal Levin< /name><text>Amoderm is great. Before I decided to get Botox I researched and read reviews for weeks about various doctors. I chose Dr. Jafari because she had great reviews and was female.

My first appointment was a consultation. Dr. Jafari gave me a recommendation of how many units of Botox I would need. She took time explaining her recommendation. I didn’t feel like she was trying to give me too much and she didn’t push anything on me. I came back a few weeks later and had the injections done.

I’ve been back several times now for more Botox. I’m always pleased with the cleanliness of the office and how friendly and helpful the staff and Dr. Jafari are.

I definitely recommend Amoderm!< /text></record>

I love Amoderm. I had done my first session of Sculsure for my love handles through their ongoing special.  Dr Jafari and the consultant was very helpful and honest at the time of consultation. My nurse was friendly.  It is 4 weeks after treatment and I should wait 6 to 12 weeks to see the final  result. My flanks are  getting already smooth and my circumference is already 1 inch less. I will go back definitely for my second session. Very nice, clean and organized office.<//text>

First of all, the reason why I chosen Dr. Jafari is because she uses canula technique while injecting and that significantly reduces the bruising side effect as well as helps with better distribution of filler that makes final result better looking. And I am absolutely obsessed with my results!!! Every single day I look in the mirror and appreciate the work she has done for me!!!  I am also very thankful for both the kind staff in the office who put up with my ridiculous questions and was so comforting! Thank you Dr. Jafari!<//Review>< Rate>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Wonderful experience with having my acne scars treated her at Amoderm. Despite some skepticism due to bad experiences at another medspa years before, when I scheduled my first consult, I knew right away that I was at the right place as everyone from the receptionists to my consultant and the doctor where helpful and clearly showed an interest in helping me out. My consultant took her time explaining different treatments and their plus and minuses and felt no pressure at all. They indicated that I was a candidate for either micro needling or fractional co2 laser – the first treatment is supposed to be milder and has no or very limited down time but I was eager to see results sooner and so I decided to do the CO2 laser (3 sessions altogether). The numbing was included but I had to pay $80 for their bleaching cream as well which I think was very effective as it made my face much lighter and this allowed the nurse to go higher with the laser energy level. Each treatment left my face with some redness and swelling for a few days but I followed the treatment care instructions carefully and my skin was back to normal soon after. I started noticing improvements specially after the 2nd and 3rd session and the acne scars look much better. I am also happy with the overall tone and texture of my face and see clear improvements.< /text>< Pictures>

Dr. Jafari is the queen of lip injections!! I did my lips with her and I am in love with the results! Very nice and pouty but also proportional to my face and very natural looking. I get tons of compliments on how beautiful my lips are – most think I got it from my mom (who actually has beautiful lips but I guess I wasn’t that lucky). Thank you thank you!<//review>

I am very pleased with the Kybella treatment I got from Dr. Elham. I had a moderate double chin and she recommended 8 vials in total over 3 sessions (4 vials first and then 2 and 2 in the following months). The injections were not painful and I had some swelling afterward (mostly after the first shots) but was glad to see the results after completing all the injections she recommended. Being happy with her work, I didn’t stop there and I also did Botox for my frown lines and eyes plus some volume in my cheeks and so far all looks great!< /Review>

It’s been a few weeks since my Ultherapy treatment at Amoderm and so far so good! I highly recommend Dr. Jafari and her staff for cosmetic treatments. Have been coming here for a few years and always feel welcomed. Dr. Jafari is very nice and she truly cares for what she does and for her patients. Regarding my personal experience, I have been getting some fillers (from Dr. Jafari of course!) with great results, but wanted to tighten and lift up the lower face and neck and jowls area and Dr. Jafari recommended Ultherapy. The treatment itself was not painful but it took a while to cover all the areas (which was a positive, as I could see my nurse was taking her time to make sure no area is missed). I had very mild redness right after the treatment which was gone in no time and already see the results in form of tighter skin and lifted jawlines. This is supposed to be preliminary results as I’ve done the study and it takes several months for the body to make new collagen, so I am very excited and looking forward to even better results in the coming months. Will try to update here!< /Text>

Dr. Elham Jafari and her staff at Amoderm are very friendly and passionate about their work.  They did a wonderful job for me. The wait time at the office was only a few minutes and they patiently answered all of my questions.

I strongly recommend Amoderm to anyone looking for a great service at a reasonable price.<//Review>

Since early teenage years I was unhappy about the look of my lips and suffered social anxiety. I always had to use heavy make up to conceal the thin lips and it was really bothering me until Dr. Jafari helped me with a nice lip injection and gave me some much-needed volume and lift! Now I can go out even without make up and from time to time I even hear compliments on how lucky I am for having such beautiful lips – well I guess I was lucky to find Dr. Jafari.<//text>

I have shadowed Dr. Jafary at her clinic. As a medical student I can confidently say that Dr. Jafary represents the ideal physician. She is everything a good physician must be and more. She is not only knowledgeable and confident in her practice but she also has an excellent bedside manner.</Review>

< review>
I had some stubborn fat around my abdomen and flanks although overall I am in good shape. I have tried cool sculpting a year ago and I was not sure with its result or the tenderness after the sessions. Not only I did not see any improvement but I also had lots of numbness and shooting pain at the treated areas after my treatment for long time. I was referred to Amoderm through one of my friends and after some hesitation, decided to give it a chance to Sculpsure for my flanks and abdominal fat. We had a pretty detailed consultation and Dr Jafari mapped all of my areas and put all the settings to make sure that I get the best results (she is very friendly and professional). I did 2 sessions so far and very happy with my result. I started to see that my waist curve and my abdomen are getting smaller and better toned. Some discomfort through the procedure but for sure no down time and complication afterward. Love my result, Dr Jafari and Amoderm.< /review>

Hands-down this is the best place in the OC to get laser hair removal. I have been a client for many years and couldn't be happier. Everything from the warm greeting of the staff and informative initial consult to the highly organized scheduling of the treatments and the professional and friendly nurses all send the message that these people know what they are doing and they are great in doing it. I had my initial consultation for laser hair removal and my consultant and Dr. Jafari both patiently listened to me and my horror story of past experience at another place. They took time to explain how laser hair removal worked and all the things I was supposed to do to get better results (which I followed religiously and I am so glad with the outcome!) Their laser machines are very powerful and unlike the other place where I either had to suffer burns or fail to see any results, their results were consistently better than what I had hoped for. Absolutely no burns or missed areas, and I was happy to see the hair falling off after each treatment and growing less and less, to the point that soon, it was almost nowhere to be seen. Oh what a relief! Now I hardly ever have to shave and any hair that grows in between the shaves is barely noticeable. I just can't say their praises enough. This is absolutely the best money you can spend for yourself (or loved ones) to save yourself from the hassles of never-ending shaving or painful waxing and Amoderm is the best place to do it.<//Text>

<Text>I met Dr. Jafari back in April for a consult to help with my dark circles and underwent filler injection as she suggested (Restylane and Volbella plus volume for the cheeks). I had some swelling and mild bruising that lasted for a few days but other than that the recovery was quick and the results look very good. I can hardly see the dark circles and I can feel that the fillers in my cheeks have lifted up my face in a very nice and natural way. I think it was well worth it and I will certainly be back for future touch ups and treatments.<//Text>< date>

I heard about this place from a friend and booked a consult. After meeting Dr. Jafari I bought a fraxel co2 laser package for stretch marks as well as a package of erbium laser for brown spots and pigmentations on my face. The co2 laser was done by their nurses and the erbium laser peel was done by Dr. herself. I am happy with both treatments and see clear improvements and will continue my treatments at Amoderm< /text>

<review>I got referred to Dr. Jafari to evaluate my nose before doing surgery and she said I was a candidate for nonsurgical nose job. My main concerns were a wide nose bridge and a little bump on my nose but I was really hesitant to undergo surgery as I have a very busy life. Dr. Jafar injected Voluma to reshape the nose bridge and also used volume to fix the nose bump. Everything turned out to be great and I am happy with my new improved nose done without surgery! Definitely recommend it!< /review><name>L Hernandez</name><rating>5<//rating></record>

This is my place to go for juvederm and botox. The doctor does an excellent job and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the work. I highly recommend Dr. J for anyone looking for botox and filler. Making appointment is always easy and their staff are very helpful and quick with calls, emails and chats. Overall a great place!<//Text>

Loved the work done by Dr Jafari on my lips. My lips were on the thinner side and throughout my teenage and early adulthood years they made me self-conscious and I always thought if there was one thing I wanted to change in my face, it would have been my lips. The fear of pain and horrifying pictures of super pumped up lips kept me at the bay for years until I found the courage to get more serious and after doing some search, found Dr. Jafari. She was very nice and accommodating and was able to answer all my questions and put my concerns at rest. I got Juvederm and considering the new look (which I love) and the ease of the process, my only regret is why I didn’t do sooner. Highly recommended procedure as long as you do it with someone highly skilled and experienced like Dr. J!<//review>

Dr. Jafari was able to reshape my lips beautifully with Juvederm Volbella and I am truly thankful. I got the volume I needed and my lips are nice and pouty without looking strange.

Very pleased with the sculpsure results so far. I have completed 2 sessions on my tummy and love handles and the extra bulk of fat has almost gone and cut in half if not more. So glad I don’t have to live with the stubborn fat and can melt is away with sculpsure.< /Text>

<text>I have lost tons of weight, so as a result my face looked very saggy and hollow. The hollows and dark circles under my eyes and sagging cheeks and jowls made me look really old and tired. It all changed after I saw Dr Jafari at Amoderm. At my consult I found her to be a good listener and absolutely passionate to help her patients. She explained the procedure in details and showed me several before  and after pics. I have done Volbella under my eyes and Volume in my cheeks and jawlines and some Botox at my forehead to lift my eyebrows non surgically. She is very gentle and light handed with an excellent bed side manner. I love her and will recommend her to my friends and family.< /text>< Pics>

I can’t recommend Dr. Jafari and Amoderm enough! Very nice and sweet doctor and truly an expert in what she does. She is the only doctor I trust for my filler work and she has done a great job with helping me to get rid of the dark circles under eyes and lifting my jawlines with fillers (Volbella and Voluma). I have also been a client for Sculpsure to sculpt my tummy and flanks. Most recently I did Ultherapy on my lower face and neck to further lift the jawlines and tighten the skin around it and it was a nice touch to compliment the prior filler work I had done there. I was a bit worried if the Ultherapy would negatively affect my fillers, but since Dr. Jafari was the one who had done the fillers, she was able to navigate the treatment to avoid the fillers and it all came out fine. As for the results, my skin feels much more tighter and lifted and I am getting tons of compliments. Very pleased with the treatment and with Dr. Jafari and her team!< /review>

Dr.Jafari is the best! I am a longtime Botox client of her and never go anywhere else. I am very picky about my doctors and do recommend her for botox and filler works. I have done my forehead, frown lines (11s), and crow’s feet to name a few and love the nice and natural brow lift she does for me with Botox. By the way I have also tried xeomin at their office the last time as there was a rebate and to my excitement, it worked equally well. It’s a newer formulation of botox and it’s supposed to work the same and I can confirm that.<//text>

<review>I have had multiple areas treated with laser for hair removal at Amoderm and it always works like charm. It’s nice to know doctor is at office almost always although I never ran into problems anyway. The lasers they use has a cooling mist sprayed on the skin during the treatment which helps keeping it more comfortable although for bikini and under arm areas numbing cream is a must. Each treatment zaps about 10-15% of the hair so be ready to make the commitment to be going back to the clinic for quite a few times but they do have packages that help you save a lot. Overall it’s a nice medspa and they offer many things like Botox and Juvederm and many other lasers and everyone is very helpful and nice.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Another vote for nonsurgical nose job at Amoderm! Dr. Jafari helped with me filler injection to correct my nose hump and also reshape my nose bridge. It might seem counterintuitive since the doctor is injecting filler and adding volume to nose (as opposed to surgery) but I learned that the filler is used to mask and conceal the bump on the nose and also to reshape and sculpt the nose bridge to make a sharper and more prominent look, helping to create a slimmer overall look for the nose. Quite magical!! Dr. Jafari went into all the details and fully explained the procedure and different options and I am grateful to her as I know not many doctors spend this much time with their patients. My nose look much better and it helps my overall look tremendously. Very pleased!!<//Text>

This is 2 weeks post my 2nd round of Kybella shots for double chin and the treatment has worked quite well. I went to see Dr. J for Kybella after doing lots of research and she confirmed that I was a good candidate and recommend two rounds of injection with 2 and 1 vials. I had some swelling the first time but not much in the second time. The double chin is reduced by maybe 30-40% which is good enough for me and the skin definitely feels firmer over the treated area which is big bonus. So far no numbness or other issues, so keeping my fingers crossed!<//review>

<text>I visited Dr. Jafari last year when I did a consult to see what treatments are available to contour my jawline and make it firmed and help with the moderate double chin I had for many years. Dr. Jafari suggested Kybella and recommended that I do 3 rounds of injection with a total 6 vials. I followed her recommendation and didn’t have much issue other than a bit of swelling after each injection which lasted for 1-2 days and went away. The good news is that Kybella worked very well and after doing the 3rd round and waiting for a few months to make sure it’s done its magic, I am glad to say that the double chin is significantly less and almost 30-40% gone. During this time I maintained the same weight so I can tell for sure that the Kybella has worked for me, but for anyone considering it, please be patient and follow your doctor’s recommendation since almost everyone needs to complete the 2-3 rounds of injection to see good results. I really enjoy my new slimmer profile and the firmer jaw line and recommend this treatment and this wonderful doctor!<//text>< time>

The best part is that she does the injections herself and she is highly experienced. I love the nice brow lifts she does for me with botox (and disport recently) and I have also had fillers done in my cheeks, laugh lines and jaw line and it all look very natural.  I wish I could give them one thousand stars!</text>< Pictures>

<text>I have been a regular at Amoderm since 2013 or so and through all these years, I have tries many of the treatments they offer, so I think I can give a pretty accurate assessment of what they do. First let me start by saying that Dr. Jafari is truly a gem and the sweetest doctor I’ve seen! She is so open and honest and easy going and always right on with her advice and recommendations! Nowadays when I go to see her, I pretty much just ask her to go ahead and do whatever she thinks I need and she knows exactly what to do to make me look refreshed and rejuvenated again! It always better to keep working with the same doctor as she gets to know you, your skin and your taste and it’s much better than hopping from a doctor or another doctor and I can’t recommend Dr. Jafari enough! I have been getting my Botox and Dysport (when my Botox stopped working as well as before) and many types of fillers (Juvederm, Voluma and Restylane). As for the other treatments, I have done countless sessions of laser hair removal (on many areas), IPL, chemical peels, facials and microdermabrasion. My last adventure was trying RF (radiofrequency) for tightening of the skin of my arms and signed up for Venus freeze. I have always been happy with my results, quality of care and customer service. Dr Jafari is very caring and professional and experienced and skilled injector. Amoderm has been providing all I need for cosmetic and antiaging treatments and I highly recommend them to anyone.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>5< /Rating>< GmapID>

Dr. Jafari is a very knowledgable physician. She did take care of my son's acne with laser treatment. He also uses Amoderm products to maintain and is very happy with the outcomes. I would absolutely recommend her.<//Text>

Checked out the pictures here and saw those of non surgical nose job from Amoderm and did a consultation with Dr. Jafari before going ahead with surgery and I am so thankful for it! She helped me to get a similar result at a fraction of cost and without much pain or recovery. I know I will have to redo it every once a while as the filler wears off, but that’s small inconvenience compared to undergoing surgery. Of course not everyone is a candidate for liquid nose job and you need to do your homework but it’s definitely an option to consider for many like me.< /review><name>kathleen kessler</name>< Gmap_id>

<Name>Donna Smart</Name><Review>Good results with Sculpsure laser treatment for the baby bump I have been dealing with for years. I am very fit and watch my diet but couldn’t get rid of the stubborn fat below my tummy until I tried Sculpsure. It took me 3 sessions but it worked and the bump is much less noticeable. The office staff were very nice and helpful and doctor was always around and I never had any issues scheduling my appointments etc. I am not sure what kind of results I could have got from Coolsculpting but won’t bother as Sculpsure clearly worked for me!<//Review><time>1528493984314< /time><user>101063242120166173082< /user>< rating>

Ok, I admit that deep in my heart I wanted to have the Kardashians’ lips, so my search for a doctor I can trust with my lips started and led me to Dr. Jafari and I am so happy for finding her. She did a thorough analysis on my face and lips and showed me some pictures on what changes to expect and to make sure she exactly knew what I wanted and then got busy working on my lips. Her work was spot on and I got the lips I always envied! Nice job doctor!</Review>

<text>I will not recommend anyone else other than Dr Jafari for lip injections. I had nice and full lips but had a little bit of unevenness especially in the upper lip and Dr. JAfari was able to fix it for me. She also added a very nice and subtle volume which gave my lips a nice lift. The best part was that she numbed me and I didn’t feel a thing! Btw the girls at the office are very nice and helpful and I have a very good experience.</text>< Pictures>

I came to Amoderm inquiring about which procedure would be best to minimize my stubborn lower belly fat. The staff was very friendly and Dr. Jafari was very kind and knowledgeable. The consultant advised me on SculpSure, which uses heat to permanently destroy fat cells. I decided to chose this procedure and I recently visited Amoderm to do my first SculpSure session. The staff made me feel comfortable and put my nerves at ease. The procedure took about 25 minutes and there was only very minimal discomfort. The best part about this procedure is that there is no downtime. I went to the gym later that day and went to work the next day. I can’t wait for my next session, thank you Amoderm team and Dr. Jafari!<//text>

I did months of research on Cool sculpting and Sculpsure and at the end, decided to go ahead with Sculpsure for the stubborn fat bump I had right below my belly bottom and above the c-section cut and also a bit of bulges on my flanks. I was mainly concerned over the risk of nerve damage that kept me away from doing Coolsculpting. I went to Amoderm and after speaking with my consultant and Dr. Jafari, I decided to give it a try and signed up for 3 cycles. Results: 2 months after the 3rd cycles, I am formally down to size 2 from an initial size 4! It worked on me!< /text>

<Name>Molly Knight< /Name><text>Dr. Jafari is amazing! I had a consultation with her for doing some works on my face as I had dropped a couple of pounds and it really made my face look tired and sunken. I was looking for a long term solution and she recommended Bellafill. I did a cheek augmentation and also did some more for lines around my mouth and the results came out very nice and natural. I am glad that Dr. Jafari was able to save my face (literally!). It’s now over 6 months since the 2nd injection and it’s going strong with nice lift to my cheeks and I feel that my whole face is lifted and I enjoy a more refreshed and upbeat look!</text>< response>

Overall I am happy with the results. Dr Jafar is very good with fillers and highly recommended. She recommended that I get fillers for under eyes, temples and cheeks and I followed her advice and it worked very nice altogether. I’m in love with my new look specially the restylane under the eyes and voluma that was placed in my cheeks.< /text>

I have a recessed chin which affected my face in very unpleasant way and made my neck look short. I wasn’t ready for surgery and didn’t want to do chin implants so I was happy to learn that it can be fixed with filler and after lots of research, saw Dr. Jafari. She did chin augmentation with Voluma and was able to reshape my chin and add a nice prominence which is a lot more in line with my face and neck and I can’t believe how much positive difference this relatively simple procedure has made. The whole visit took around 30 minutes (plus an initial consult I had done before) I was back to work right after the injection with not swelling or other issues. Voluma is more expensive but I think it’s well worth the price as it lasts longer and holds its shape better. Following the chin filler, I also did my lips with Voluma and also did Botox on mu frown lines and crow’s feet with Dr. Jafari. Dr. Jafari is very nice and attentive and I felt very comfortable being treated by her.< /Text>

I know I needed to do something about the bags and dark circles under my eyes but have been afraid to let anyone touch them as I had heard about the risks of filler injections in tear troughs. Dr. Jafari was the one who helped me overcome my fears and I am thankful to her. I watched her videos doing the injections and talking about cannula method which made me book an appointment with her. She explained the procedure in details and provided all the details. After the injections (which were quite pain-free) I had some bruising which went away within a few days and took the ugly dark circles with it. My only regret is I wish I had done it sooner.<//Text>

I visited Dr. Jafari last year when I did a consult to see what treatments are available to contour my jawline and make it firmed and help with the moderate double chin I had for many years. Dr. Jafari suggested Kybella and recommended that I do 3 rounds of injection with a total 6 vials. I followed her recommendation and didn’t have much issue other than a bit of swelling after each injection which lasted for 1-2 days and went away. The good news is that Kybella worked very well and after doing the 3rd round and waiting for a few months to make sure it’s done its magic, I am glad to say that the double chin is significantly less and almost 30-40% gone. During this time I maintained the same weight so I can tell for sure that the Kybella has worked for me, but for anyone considering it, please be patient and follow your doctor’s recommendation since almost everyone needs to complete the 2-3 rounds of injection to see good results. I really enjoy my new slimmer profile and the firmer jaw line and recommend this treatment and this wonderful doctor!< /text>

<text>I had seen another doctor for dark circles under eyes but wasn’t happy with the results as I felt lumps like two big worms under my eyes and it didn’t go away after waiting for quite some time. After waiting for another year or so I got the courage to revisit the issue and this time gave Dr. Jafari a try and I don’t regret it a bit! She was professional, friendly, and clearly highly skilled in filler injections for tear troughs and under eyes. The injections were much easier than prior experience with the other doctor as Dr. Jafari used cannula and she had skillful hands. She paused a few time to show me the progress and I couldn’t believe the difference when I saw my picture with one side injected and the other side undone. Truly amazing! She told me about the follow up in 2 weeks which I ended up not needing as my results came out perfect. I definitely recommend Dr. Jafari for filler shots. By the way I got Volbella for under eyes.<//text><rate>5< /rate><Gmap_id>0x80dcdd69f39d7cd1:0x67cf1466d7a3e1f6<//Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response>< user>

I am very pleased with Microneedling and fillers I did at Amoderm. My primary problem was large pores and I signed up for a package of 3 of treatments. After completing the sessions, I can say that my pores are tighter and much less noticeable. I also talked with Dr. Jafari for hollows under eyes and she did injection with some Volbella and volume for my cheeks and it all came out very nice. Dr. Jafari is very personable and leaves no question unanswered. Very nice doctor!</review>

Micro-needling with PRP worked very well for my acne scar. I knew from the start that fractional CO2 would be the ultimate treatment for my condition, but as my job is mostly outdoors, and figured I could not handle CO2 laser and its down-time and I settled for microneedling. To my surprise, it worked very well and my skin looks smother with a nice glow and the scars are far less noticeable. Dr. Jafari and her nurses are very nice and friendly and it’s always a pleasant experience going to the clinic and meeting the staff at Amoderm.<//Text>

Great results with Voluma for correction of a nose bump that has been making me unwilling to go out for many years. Not anymore – thanks to Dr. Jafari at Amoderm! She did an excellent job fixing my nose hump with Voluma as I was looking for a more long lasting solution.  Dr. Jafari explained all the options and answered all my questions and I am very happy with the results.< /text>

Cannot be happier than this. Dr. Jafari is great all around with an artistic touch. From now on I will not go anywhere.  I have tried some Juvederm and voluma on the face and Venus Freeze for my thighs to battle cellulite. Happy with all treatments so far!</Review>

<name>Krystaliah</name><rate>5< /rate><Review>Another vote for Venus Freeze and Sculpsure treatments at Amoderm! I am quite slim but have had some stubborn far in more core area forever. I started off with 3 sessions of Sculpsure on my tummy and flanks and can say for sure that I see the stubborn fat is gone down a lot. To make sure that it won’t be back and to further smooth out the treated area, I also did a series of Venus Freeze on the same areas. The only catch for Venus is that you need to do it every week so if you work full time like me, fitting it in your schedule can get a bit tricky but it is well worth it! I love the results of both treatments and I am ready for the summer! YAY!</Review><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

I have been going to Amoderm for the laser hair removal and Venus Freeze for a few years and have consistently had positive experience with the staff and Dr. Jafari. I was pleased to learn that they were also offering SculpSure treatments and I signed up in a heartbeat. I have done one session of sculpsure on my belly and love handles and now at 6 weeks past the treatment, my skin is better toned and firmer in the treated area. I am especially happy with the love handles. I plan to continue with more cycles of sculpsure and hope I keep seeing good results. I will update here.</text>

Dr. Jafari injected my lips with Juvederm Volbella and I am happy. I was looking for a very subtle pout and her skills did the trick. I’m not super pumped up which kept my at bay from getting lip injections for years but when I had my consultation with Dr. jafari, I was assured that she is the one and I didn’t regret it. She also did my Botox for frown lines and crows’ feet and they also worked very well.< /Review>

Dr. Jafari is among the most experienced cosmetic doctors to do filler injections under the eyes. She skillfully injected filler with cannula under my eyes and helped me get rid of the dark circles and bags under my eyes. She used Restylane and Volbella for me and injected them with her special technique that is supposed to create a more uniform and natural results and it definitely worked for me. For under eye fillers, Dr. Jafari is the best.</Text>

<resp>{'time': 1521340648848, 'text': 'Hi and thank you. There are several issues mentioned here that could not have been further from truth. As an example, Dr. Jafari’s consultations are very thorough and she spends several minutes with her patients to discuss their concerns and how we can best help them. While many physicians charge a fee for the consultation, Dr. Jafari provides this as a complimentary service and most patients see the great value of this service and appreciate it.\n\nDespite being critical of us, we believe that this review gives us a great opportunity to explain our philosophy of care. Determining the dose of a medication such as Botox is a medical decision that should best be left to qualified clinicians. The right dose of Botox has absolutely nothing to do with the age of patient as it depends on the muscle tone and strength. A very young patient with strong and active muscles may need far more Botox than an older patient who has weaker muscles. As a decorated cosmetic physician with training in neuromuscular medicine, Dr. Jafari is among the most qualified physicians to determine the needed dose of Botox to achieve satisfactory results and most patients trust her clinical judgment. In rare cases when a patient insists on getting incorrect dose of Botox, Dr. Jafari might not be able to do the treatment as it will most likely be ineffective and will only be a waste of patient’s time and money.\nWe would like to remind that in a case like this, Dr. Jafari has already dedicated her time to consulting the patient for free, and it makes all the financial sense that she just gives the treatment the patient is asking for and gets paid for it, rather than refusing to do so and losing the patient. However, Dr. Jafari never betrays her Oath and commitment to always serving the best interests of her patients, and she will never provide a treatment that she believes will be ineffective.\nTo all who might be reading this, if you are interested in being seen and treated by a caring and compassionate real physician who is double board certified with subspecialty training in neuromuscular medicine which makes her most qualified for injecting Botox and fillers in face and other parts of body, a physician who is honest with you and places your best interest above all – even if doing so means that she might lose someone’s business or earn an occasional negative review – we invite you to contact us and make your appointment to experience it all for yourself. Thank you!'}</resp>< date>

DO NOT GO HERE! I have been getting Botox in Newport for the last 4 years and NEVER have I EVER been told that if I don't spend $700 on JUST Botox, then I will not see ANY results. Today I arrived 5 minutes early to fill out the new patient paper work, waited 30 min. PAST my appt. time to see the Dr. who then evaluated a photo of my face didn't even take a close look at my face right in front of her but chose to refer to the screen and told me a nurse would be in shortly to go over everything she had just told me and UP-SELL me on $700 worth of Botox. I AM 27 YEARS OLD, I have been getting preventative Botox for the last 4 years and I am not trying to look like Kylie Jenner. Mama just needed a little refresher. After kindly letting the nurse know that I am willing to spend within the $200-$300 range which would cover the area I was focused on, the Dr. said that she wouldn't be willing to give me any Botox unless I agreed to the $700 she recommended. WOW! Not only did she waste an hour of my time, but apparently my money wasn't good there either. I went back to girls in Newport and they were happy to give me the look I was looking for. I am not one to usually write a review, however I felt inclined bc the online reviews were the reason I found myself in Amoderm. The Dr is beyond rude and a liar. To shoot 35 units of Botox in one area is unnecessary when you're muscles are completely flat at 20. You tried to up sell the WRONG GIRL HONEY!< /Text>

<text>Just did my #2 sculpsure cycle and I am already back to work – no downtime whatsoever! I had done Coolsculpting before and was happy with the result but the pain following the cycle was too much to bear and I decided to give Sculpsure a try. Result-wise, I think they both did a good job and I saw clear results after the first session in both treatments. However, Sculpsure treatment was shorter and much easier to go back to work. Regarding the pain during the treatment, Cool sculpting was 6-7 out of 10 at start but once the area was numbed from coldness, it was much less painful. For Sculpsure I think it was a 2-3 out of 10 throughout the treatment. I recommend checking out Sculpsure for anyone considering Coolsculpting and highly recommend Dr. Jafari and Amoderm.< /text></record>

Pari at Amoderm is great! I am a big fan of their microdermabrasions and always do the facial upgrade. I used to do microderms at a day spa before switching to Amoderm and can clearly see the difference. Amazingly, the price is not that much higher with their monthly club membership. My skin is much brighter and smoother with less fine lines and sun spots. I highly recommend microdermabrasion treatments at Amoderm as a great ongoing maintenance for skin.<//Text>

Dr. Jafari did an outstanding job fixing the bump on my nose with Juvederm voluma. She injected the nose bridge and the back of my nose and created a much more straight profile which is exactly what I wanted. Voluma is supposed the last two years so hopefully I’ll be good for quite some time but when it’s time to do it again, I will be back to Dr. Jafari.</Text>

<text>To all people that look for an affordable yet high-end medspa with a real doctor who is there every day and does care for her patients, Amoderm is the place to go! I have done quite a few things at Amoderm and cannot be happier. Their Venus Freeze put an end to my misery with the cellulite I had on my thighs forever, and their Sculpsure was like a magic in zapping the love handles I got after pregnancy. All looks good so far! All my nurses have been friendly and Dr Jafari is always helpful and present to address questions. I have also done injections with her and the results have been the same: Superb!<//text>< username>

I have had multiple laser hair removal sessions at Amoderm. If you really want to go there let me give you the scoop:

1) If they offer you a "package" deal (and they will), don't take it! Their package deal worked out to about $200 a session. My sessions would last about 15 minutes.

If you look at their pricing, they claim you can buy a half hour for $150. That means I paid almost double the price for my first few sessions. Whoops! Shame on me I guess.

2) Inconsistent staff roster and quality. Some of their techs are good, some aren't. This will really change the results of your session, and how much they get done. I have had really good work and I have had sessions where they obviously missed spots. They seem to have a hard time keeping the good people. Hmmmmm....

3) If they burn you don't expect much from them. I now have a 1.5 inch scar on my back where a tech hit my tattoo with the laser (which also obliterated part of the tattoo BTW). Their response? Bummer for you. Here's some cream that will make the scar go away (It didn't).

4) If you still really want to buy their services I recommend you set a timer at the start of your session! What finally broke me as a customer was when I bought an hour of hair removal and got 40 minutes. Pretty sneaky stuff.

I have a hard time believing all these 5 star reviews. In my experience, they are pretty mediocre to poor in every aspect of their business. I hope this review is helpful and you can avoid some of the pitfalls that I encountered when purchasing their services.

So here's an update: Shortly after I posted this review someone called me and offered a free session to compensate me for my troubles. Thanks, but no thanks. This isn't about the money. I want other people to know what happened and to be able to defend themselves from your business practices. You have taken me for a fool. I'm sure you do it to other clients and then buy them off if they complain publicly. Not me. This review stays up.

I have also included a picture to show you what it looks like when they miss spots doing hair removal. You can see how the hair on my abdomin has grown bacvk in with a leopard pattern. Thanks Amoderm!< /review>
<pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1510982121053, 'text': 'Thank you for taking time to post this review. To protect the privacy of our patients we cannot publicly discuss the matters related to individual patient care here and we invite you to contact us directly and allow us to address all concerns properly. This being said and for general information, we provide the following clarifications:\n\n1) Since a series of 6 laser treatment sessions are recommended to see good results in most patients, we provide package discounts for 6-session packages and they almost always offer the most saving. There might have been some miscalculations in prices mentioned here, but the package pricing almost always comes ahead. For any clients interested, we will gladly do the math both ways to see which way comes lower.\n\n2) We pay great attention to our staff and their training and we are most eager to retain the good staff in our team, but from time to time and due to changes such as relocation, we have to reluctantly let a staff go. This could happen to any practices, but we also have many staff who stay and work with us for several years.\n\n3) We have treated thousands of patients with lasers with great results. In rare cases when complications occur (as it might with any medical treatments), we do stand by our patients and provide them with all needed care and support and address all concerns that have been raised.\n\n4) We strongly reject any kinds of allegations that the timed sessions we provide are intentionally cut short. Our nurses use timers during timed laser sessions and the time is kept very accurately in general. There have been extremely rare cases that errors have happened (e.g. due to timer malfunction) and in all those cases as soon as we learnt about the problem, we immediately approached the patients and offered them the extra sessions to cover any possibly missed time. We operate a highly reputable clinic and it is simply not worth to risk our reputation over shaving off a few minutes of a session when we already have blocked the schedule of our nurse for the full time for a patient.\n\nAt Amoderm, we work very hard to earn and retain the trust of our patients with great customer service and safe and effective treatments and we have treated several thousands of patients over the last several years who have been very happy with their results. A few of our patients have shared their positive experience here (or allowed us to post their before and after pictures here) and we are grateful to them even more. We understand that it is impossible to please everyone but that remains an ultimate goal for us. We invite all to contact us and make their appointment for a complimentary consultation and experience various services at Amoderm first hand for themselves rather than trusting others’ words – positive or negative.

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>Wow, cannot believe the results! I had seen the pictures of liquid facelift patients at Dr. Elham’s page but always thought those were rare cases and there was no way I could see such impressive results. It turned out I was wrong. After some Dysport on forehead and crows feet (similar to Botox but they had an offer for Dysport), Restylane under eyes, Voluma in cheeks and more filler in temples and around the mouth, I am glad to say that the treatment works and it gives a very nice and natural look which is easily ten years younger. Actually I always had eye bags even from a younger age, so I doubt I looked this refreshed even ten years ago. Dr. Jafari is a true artist and a very sweet doctor and it’s always a pleasure to see her and her team.<//review>< resp>

After doing fillers around my mouth and for my nasolabial folds for over ten years, I was ready to move to something more permanent, but not full surgery yet. So I looked up Bellafill and it seemed to be what I was looking for and I went to Dr. Jafaro for the injection given her stellar reputation. She did my consultation and agreed that I am a good candidate for Bellafill and she gave me the test dose. Luckily I had no reaction and I was back a few weeks later for the actual shots when went fine. I had a bit of swelling and bruising (on one side) for a few days but other than that the recovery was quick and I am happy hoping that I won’t have to go back to get the injections as frequently as before. I hope it is going to last for 5 years as they say.< /text>

After doing lots of research about Coolsculpting and Sculpsure, I chose Sculpsure to get rid of the stubborn fat at my abdomen and flanks without getting a lipsuction. I knew that lipo was the most effective route but I didn’t want the pain and downtime and was looking for something that was fast without so much pain and could reduce the fat bulk slowly and gradually and Sculpsure fit the bill. The staff was very friendly and informative and Dr Jafari did a great job mapping of the area of treatment to maximize the results. Very Friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices. After I finished my Sculpsure sessions (they recommended 3 sessions for best results) I also got Venus Freeze (radiofrequncy) at a special discount for cellulites and to further tighten the loose skin of my thighs and flanks. I am happy with the results so far.< /text>

<Text>I did my nose with Dr. Jafari and I am quite excited with the results. My problem was quite subtle, mostly a bump on the nose and Dr. Jafari fixed it with injecting fillers in the bridge area and around the bump to smooth it out. Her work was impeccable and the best part was that I was done in 30 minutes. After the injections I had no problems other than some redness that lasted for a few hours and the correction looks very nice. I would rate the procedure as a definite worth it and I recommend dr. Jafari for liquid nosejob.<//Text>< pics>

I have been getting Restylane in my face (under eyes and tear troughs) for a few years and only trust Dr. Jafari. She has the skills and an artistic eye to make sure the results come out nice and natural with minimal pain, discomfort, bruising and swelling. I once made the mistake of going to another injector and my undereyes looked overfilled and very unnatural and I had to ask Dr. Jafari to dissolve it with enzyme and redo it correctly. I will never make that mistake again. Thank you Dr. Jafari.<//text>

I was always fed up with my tired look with hollow and bags under the eyes and saggy jowls and marionette lines. I was looking for nonsurgical treatments (liquid face lift) and Dr Jafari was answer to my prayer! What an artist! I had seen 2 other doctors before her and I was told that there were not any options for the dark circle under the eyes and Dr. Jafari proved that to be wrong! I have done Juvederm Volbella under my eyes and Juviderm voluma filler in my cheeks and jaw lines and I truly turned 10 years younger. Still I look very natural and nobody could figure out what done. Thank you Dr Jafari for your artistic work and knowledge. You are the best.</review>

<Name>Ker Paton<//Name><date>1508962390552<//date><rating>5<//rating><Review>Doctor Jafari did my lips and she did a nice job. We discussed a number of fillers and I opted for Juvederm to start as it was my first time and I think it was definitely worth it. Dr Jafari was very nice and she helped a lot easing my anxiety before doing the shots and the injection itself was not bad at all – just a slight pinch and that was it! I had very slight swelling but luckily no bruising at all. Actually I quite like my lips with the swelling as they look a tad bigger, so I’m thinking to go back to Dr. Jafari for another syringe of Juvederm as we had discussed before and she had advised me to go slower and come back later on. I am very happy with Dr Jafari’s work and her staff.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Had a great time getting my 1st Sculpsure treatment done.  As well as, interacting with all of the staff at Amoderm. They're all soo sweet! My Sculpsure treatment was a lot better then CoolSculpting, which I had done earlier this year in a different medical spa. I'm already starting to see results from this one treatment and can't wait to go back to do my second one!< /Text>< rate>

<Text>I have done combination of Venus freeze and sculpsure for my stubborn fat and cellulite of the back of my thighs and flank and glad to report that I can see significant improvements. I had zero pain with Venus freeze. Sculpsure was also ok to tolerate – it wasn’t really painful but just a strange sensation of heat and cold. Fabulous customer service and friendly staff and reasonable prices.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>My skin is quite fair and I sunburn like crazy. We moved to OC about 3 years ago and unfortunately California sun caused me lots of brown spots and hyper pigmentation and heavy sun damage. Tired of trying and wasting money on several bleaching medications, a quick google search led me to amoderm.  During the consultation Dr J. and her consultants were helpful. I liked the part that they seemed very relaxed and non-pushy and they seemed truly care about me not the $$ I spend. I signed up for a series of IPL and to my surprise it worked really nice and I can say that the hyper pigmentation and sun sports are faded by at least 60-70%. I mark that as a great success in my book! By the way not only their nurses are very sweat, they are also really well experienced. Overall all a great team and A+ experience!<//text>< username>

Dr. Jafari's name has become almost synonymous with the word "reliable" in our family. My wife was apprehensive about laser treatments but my birthday gift to her turned out to be a huge success, thanks in no small part to Dr. Jafari's fantastic work and the wonderful experience her staff created for my wife.<//text>

<text>I love everything about Amoderm and Dr Jafari. You cannot go wrong with this place.  For the past 2 years and I have been doing my filler and Botox with Dr Jafari with nice results. Recently I tried Kybella for my double chin and was equally satisfied. I did my 3rd session about 2 months ago. My chin now looks much better toned and slim and I can see my jaw lines. Dr Jafari was very gentle with the shots and she is the master of all these facial injection with an artistic look.<//text>< user_id>

<text>My aesthetician referred me to Amoderm for PRP with microneedling and that was the best decision I have ever made for my skin. I have done 2 sessions so far. I love my skin glow and texture. My acne scars look smoother. Amoderm is a high-end medspa with reasonable prices. Dr Jafari is very helpful in answering questions and she is at clinic most days. The nurses are friendly and professional. The front girls rock!< /text>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><text>When it comes to cosmetic treatments and plastic surgery, I am very conservative. I was concerned about my hollow cheeks and saggy jowls and hollow under the eyes. I found Dr Jafari through Instagram and did nonsurgical liquid face lift with combination of Botox and Juvederm Voluma and Restylane with her. The result is quite unbelievable. I look more restored and rested without going under the knife. Next step would be Kybella for my double chin and some touch ups with Bellafill for my next treatments as it lasts longer than Hyaluronic acid fillers, and I will be almost done with my total makeover plans!

Satisfied with my Botox for the eyebrow lifting and Volbella for the bags under the eyes at Amoderm. Also tried Juvederm Voluma non surgical nose job to correct the dent that I had at my nose. I love Dr. Jafari’s work! She is the master of the facial injection. I am completely satisfied with the results and I don’t go anywhere else for filler and Botox injection.</Text>

Great medspa with many different lasers and other treatments. I have done laser hair removal, venus freeze and sculpsure and have generally been happy with all of my treatments. Most lately I did sculpsure to trim down the love handles (yep, I got them too!) and so far I can say the skin is much tighter and the unwanted fat is reduced maybe by 30% or so in about 2 months following my first treatment, and I have one more session to go, so hopefully it will go down even more. Will update!</review>

I always go to Amoderm and Dr Jafari for my chemical peel (I do VI peel) and Botox but also did a non surgical nose job once (liquid rhinoplasty is the fancy term!) Given my consistently positive experience, I was super excited when I saw the flyer for Sculpsure there. I tried 3 cycles so far for my belly and thighs and I can see the difference. The skin is much more tight and toned and the stubborn fat is no longer bulging under my dress. I love the customer service and the quality of their care.  Amoderm and Dr Jafari rock!</text>

<Text>If you would like to get any types of fillers specially for complex procedures like non surgical nose job or lip augmentation do not waste your time and go to Dr Jafari. I learned it the hard way. After suffering from a botched job at another place, I discovered her and she did a great job for me. Dr. Jafari is the godess of Botox and fillers and you will become a believer like me if you try her once. Thank you Dr. J!</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>Dr Jafari is the best cosmetic doctor in OC. I am her loyal client from 2011. I have been doing Botox and fillers with her. I have tried several types of filler with her such as voluma, Juvederm, restylane and vollure for my lips, jaw lines, cheeks and laugh lines and I was always happy with my result.  Dr Jafari is very skillful and among the top docs in California.  At my last visit I tried Radiesse at my hands and volbella under my eyes. Check out her Gallery - my pictures are there!<//text>< Pics>

I have done couple of treatments at Amoderm and I have been very happy with the results. The laser treatments were great and helped me lot in improving my skin overall. The laser hair removal worked like a charm and I love the results - it's nowhere near what it used to be and most of the unwanted hair is gone and I just sometimes go back for a quick touch up. Also tried Botox injection with Dr. Jafari and have fallen in love with her great artistic work and great natural results. Lastly, I have been using some of Amoderm skin care products for many years and I nothing beats their quality and premium feel. I am specially a big fan of their antiaging sun block and never go out without it. Also love the rejuvenating serum they have. When it come to skin care, Amoderm is my go to place in the OC!</text>

<text>I heard about Amoderm from a friend and after doing some research about them online, decided to take the plunge and commit myself to the long drive from Los Angeles to OC. It wasn't just the long drive, but i was mainly nervous as it was my first time trying a cosmetic doctor. I have had some lines and wrinkles on my forehead and around eyes that were starting to get pretty noticeable and also didn't like the deepening lines running up around my mouth. I called Amoderm first and spoke with a lady who explained everything in detail. I told her I wasn't sure what I needed and what was best for me, and she reassured me that Dr. Jafari always does a detailed consultation and explains things that can be done and then I could decide if I wanted to do any of the treatments she suggested. Upon my arrival to the clinic, I was happy to see that the clinic was very nice and clean (with tons of parking which is a huge plus for anyone coming from LA!). The front ladies greeted me with big smiles and gave me their forms to fill and within minutes, I was seen by Dr. Jafari. Let me just tell you that Dr. Jafari is the sweetest and nicest doctor I've seen in my life! She is very friendly and all my stress and concerns disappeared within seconds as she started to talk with me and discuss the reason I was there and what was bothering me. She listened very carefully and as we talked, reviewed my pictures and areas that could use some help. She also reviewed tons of pictures from her other patients and things that she had done for them, and it was easy to see that she knew exactly what she was talking about. At the end, I decided to do some botox for my forehead and between eyebrows and some juvederm for my face (cheeks and around the mouth) and it was much easier that I thought!! She used this long needle to do the injections under the skin as she moved it around without having to poke the skin many times. It was completely pain-free, but I had to say it was a weird feeling having the needles moving under your skin! But no pain, so no complaints! We were done in no time and she gave me a lecture on things to do and not to do and what to expect after the shots and I was on my way. Now a couple of weeks has passed and I can't just believe the positive transformation this whole thing has made to my life! I no longer have to suffer from the tired and down look I used to have and I enjoy all the compliments I get from others - friends, family, coworkers and customers - on how energetic and refreshed I look. I always chuckle a bit as I can see that they can't really say what I have done but they just see that something is different in a good way, and that's really what I was hoping for to have natural results. Discovering Amoderm and Dr. Jaafari was one of the best things that happened to me, and I will gladly make the long drive anytime to go back and see her. Stop your search and call them if you are looking for an honest, nice, experienced and skilled cosmetic doctor and you won't regret it!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
I have been going to amoderm for well over 2 years and I can only say positive things. Dr. Jafari is so sweet and she is an expert in what she does. I have had botox, juvederm and sculptra (which is a new kind of filler which lasts longer) done there and the results have always been great. What I really like about her work is that it is looks so natural and subtle and it doesn't scream that you have had injections, but when I look at my pictures from a few years ago, I just can't believe that I look so much younger and more refreshed now... I have done other things like lasers there as well and don't have much to say, other than saying that they worked as I expected and can't complain.Their staff are also friendly and helpful and they make you feel welcomed and loved!!< /review>

Even though a very small part of our patients come to us from Groupon, they receive the same high level of attention and customer service as any other clients of our practice and as far as we know there hasn't been any cases of a client coming from Groupon facing any problems or issues redeeming their voucher within the terms and conditions of their voucher. Hence, we are very surprised to see your review and suspect some kinds of confusion. If not, please contact us and we will make sure to take care of any issues. Thank you!"}</Resp>

I came here to purchase Island pitaya. I didn't have my mask and ask the lady if they have mask for customers and she said no. So she refused service which I understand cause I didn't have my mask. But with Jamba Juice menu prices, I would expect them to provide masks for customers. It's a shame, if 99 cents store can provide masks for their customers, why can't Jamba Juice do the same!!!!!!</text>

<text>I went to Jamba juice today, bought a smoothie. I ended up dropping it out front of the store. The staff were awesome, they refused to let me clean it and pay for another one. They gave me a brand new smoothie even though I was at fault for dropping it. Great staff at this place.<//text></record></dataset><record>

When I got it in the cup it wasn't nearly as much as they put in a bowl and there was bananas on top of the bowl and mixed into the smoothie.

<Text>Visited this establishment about 20 minutes ago on my lunch break. I was dissatisfied with my services. I understand things are difficult w COVID19 but certain protocols should be in place. I was asked to stand outside due to only 6 people being able to be inside which is fine. I went outside waited about another ten minutes for my drinks nothing so I go back inside and they are just on the counter. If you are going to ask someone to go outside please have enough courtesy to let me know my order is ready or even go the extra mile to bring my order to me where you asked me to wait outside. Improvements on this matter would be appreciated I’m sure by the next consumer. Best wishes.< /Text>< Rating>

As usual, very friendly staff, nice place to run in and out or to sit and enjoy a yummy smoothie.
I got the new mango smoothie and my children got the gummy. It was a great experience all around.  Thank you!<//text>

<Review>The manager and staff are the best. I go there at least 5 times a week and have never had a bad experience. Everyone is friendly and professional. They always tell me any promotions they have and know my name and what order I get. I've been going to Jamba Juice for years and this is the best one I've been to. Thank you for helping start my morning off right.< /Review>< rate>

<text>First time at this location. They were pretty busy and it was a long wait to order and to get my drink. My order came out great and the girl behind the counter was apologetic about the wait.

So I went in today Feb 3 20, at 2ish. There was what seemed to be more people staffed then needed and it was obvious. When walking in there were two girls gossiping to themselves while toying around over a trash can.  When greeted we were given strange looks and answers to our order. Telling us that what we did was weird. Disrespectful in its own right.  After we had to wait for our drink that we had no lie order in advance. Just service is terrible. So t plan on coming back to this location I recommend the one near Serria meadows.< /Review>

<review>I went around 6:30pm, and it wasn't too busy. There where maybe 6 other people there and my drink was out reasonably fast. They always make good smoothies with a good consistently.  I had some from other locations near the mall were they make them too chunky and dont fix them unless you ask them too. Those locations are reasonably busier so I can understand why they wouldn't be as accommodating. This location is 5 stars all the way.<//review>< pictures>

I have come here before and never had issues, however this time things were different, the girl who took my order was very aggressive and rude. After finally placing my order she wasn’t just giving me attitude but her employees as well, I couldn’t see a name badge on her so I asked another employee what her name was, don’t let Cypress take your order, I’d recommend leaving if she’s working.< /text>

< review>
We LOVE Jamba juice but had the worst experience at this location. The cashier tried so hard to ring up the promotion of the day and kept asking the manager for help. The manager (Willow) was clearly agitated. There was a problem with the system.

Well in addition to this, I had a 3$ reward for being a Jamba member. We get Jamba for out family of 4 all the time! I hit the button to use it and then there was another problem. Willow came over, printed a paper copy, said two discounts cannot be used in the same transaction.

My husband proceeded to ask why and if not could we have it back on our account instead of a paper copy. Willow rolled her eyes and walked away. I am in complete shock! I have never seen an employee do that before. It was a simple matter, it should have been fixed or made right. The disrespect was what made this review.

I feel bad for the cashier who was super nice and had to beg for help. Clearly Willow was having a bad day, but to take it out on employees and a family, come on! She's a manager and in my opinion managagers should lead by example and her walking away while rolling her eyes is unacceptable!< /review>

<text>Clean store. Samples were available, but we're a room temperature to say the least. The music (why they had in store music is beyond me seeing a large amount of Law Enforcement in the area) was way too load that I couldn't hear myself to think about my order drink. The customer service were friendly and greeted us with smiles. Our orders was done quickly making sure that out time there seemed somewhat enjoyable. Our drinks in my opinion needed more ice and out ice cream to make it a smoothie, insted I thought it was just a drink. Bad experience at this location for me and my family.

I was asked how they can improve. First let me say, thank you for responding back to me. I would like to recommend the following.
Reduce the music volume inside the store to where the music is playing but it does not disturbe your customer. This should encourage your customer to stay longer which would make the customer want to by more of your product. On free samples. Don't leave samples out to melt due to the room temperature. Insted announce the sample and have it in a cooler ready when inquired or offered for your customer. This little cool sample of the product that you are selling can give the clients and idea what's to come when they order their drink.</text><Name>Donald Riddle</Name><user>114202364394980530667< /user><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1544341170772<//Time><Rating>2< /Rating>< resp>

<review>Nice place to hike, but does lead to some dead ends if you take the moon/goat trail. I recommend the other way, or connecting to the overlook, which has a great view of sonoma. The entire hillside is great, easy hiking and everyone is very friendly and has their masks on.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKljH0RGTsRbxwWxEPEqmvffOwdo84AcARdsqV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeBusEHlQp6tVEuXOLhlAhLNjIQYzdNeogullH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMifK6SE21QCMBKMMg8dW0U45bCOwl4gyp3q5a-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2CeNT51opQLvdS3HRgJLip9wSs_1G-aOc75u_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<review>I enjoyed hiking on the trail very much. As beautiful day, a few birds, no flowers that I saw. I'm glad I brought my hiking poles because there are steep stone steps a couple of places that I would have had a hard time with. I love to hike even with cartilage missing in both knees, so poles help a lot.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<pics>None</pics><review>Should allow bikes or at least have bike racks so those of us who go there often and like to find a private place to spend the day to sit and write don't have to haul a bunch of stuff up that steep hill. It's hard to carry something to eat and drink plus writing necessities plus a jacket or sweatshirt plus required medications plus something to sit on plus phone and backup battery pack plus whatever else is needed for someone with major health issues to be able to spend several hours out in nature. At the very least bike racks would help so bikes don't have to just be left off to the side at the bottom of the trail where anyone can see it and steal it if they wanted. At least then the back and forth trips to check on the bike with a load of stuff could be avoided. Being able to bring the bike would be ideal so the bike would be able to carry the load and trips to check on the bike wouldn't be necessary and writing would be easier without interruptions and distractions.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Great views. Lots of people wearing spandex tights. Flowers and places to sit. Trail is in partial shade. I was told the trail was 1 to 1.5 miles to the top. The trail is not steep, but it is somewhat rocky and uneven so wear decent shoes, but even then I saw someone in sandals walk up. Bring water because there is none on the trail Beware of ticks, they carry Lyme disease and the trail sign warns of this.</review></record>

This trail is neither crowded nor shaded. So please make sure to bring some water with you. There are some spots along with the trails where you can have great city view.</Text>

I have to say that fire safety is really important. Please be mindful if your smoking to keep away from the brush. It is so dry this time of year. Otherwise, I recommend the trip. Good parking and easy access (this excludes handicap parking). Have fun and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did:)</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnWKz2SHgsZIEarzQg9vGMVgXibvFuCO_ZCEKU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

You're not on the sidewalk, you do have your own gravel path, but it's not a nature hike when you hear the cars zoom by. Still the mice view at the top was pretty worth it.

< Review>
This is one of the top parks in Orange County! I used to walk over to Panorama Park all the time when I was little. It’s nestled in the heart of Fullerton, perched on top of a hill granting access to the beautiful endless view. On a clear day, you can see the Los Angeles skyscrapers, the Long Beach ports, Irvine, and of course, a clear view of Yorba Linda, Anaheim, and Orange County! This is absolutely one of my favorite places when I was growing up and I hope everyone gets a chance to experience the beauty of Panorama Park.< /Review>

<Text>I personally enjoy going on nature walks here. It is not too intense of a walk, although this nature preserve has a few steep slopes can inspire perspiration. All in all, the nature preserve is a great way to get some exercise or to reflect on the many ventures of life.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I recently added this bookmark and was eager to check it out. It's easily accessible via the Summit House parking lot; just follow the signs as you near the Coyote Hills golf course!

Eye candy all around!! Not the type you're probably thinking of... but abundant, nonetheless!  Bunnies, butterflies, squirrels, dragonflies, and oodles of flowers, trees & flowering bushes!  And the views from up top *gasp* .... I can't wait to return for an evening excursion and take in the view of the city lights below!!

The terrain varies along the path from paved trail,  to horse trail, dirt & rocks, grass & mulch.... Definitely not a monotonous trek!  Just be sure to stay on the trails and watch the signs... There is private property belonging to the nearby golf course and they want you to STAY OUT/OFF!

All types are attracted here... young, old, hikers, joggers, bicyclists, photographers, me.... Be sure your phone has a full charge because you will snap more photos than expected.... Other than selfies! :P</text><user>116050763823303540634< /user>< user_name>

<text>It's easier to walk when the weather is dry as there are slopes. You will pass by people's front yard and back yard, just follow the muddy equestrian trail and you'll be fine. Suggest to wear hiking shoes as some pathway can be uneven and with gravel, it can be slippery though I saw joggers on the trail.<//text>< Pics>

Always a nice place to take a walk and watch the moon rise in the east or watch a sunset.  The Summit House is a get place to shine and see a view of South Orange County, or the hills surrounding Brea and the North bound 57 freeway.</Text>

Solid place to hike and always clean. Just a short uphill walk with amazing views. Sits up on the backside of coyote hills golf club. Once on top you can see some spectacular views stretching from south Newport to the city of L.A. and to the east from big bear to Santiago peak covering the LA. Basin. Well worth it. Make some memories and take in the beauty just make sure to leave around Dusk or you will be jumping the fence to get out. Enjoy my friends. One love and clean up after yourself.< /text>

A nice, safe hike! The top part is really pretty, but a majority of it is just along the roads. It's accessible via the events center parking, but sometimes the golfers will put the chain with the locks around the entrance to make it seem like it's closed. It is unlocked though! For me this is a very accessible, safe, good workout. I hike it in about an hour, but that rate definitely gets my heart beating fast.< /review>

<review>Beautiful place to take an early morning or evening stroll. Great place for taking pictures too! The views of Orange County and Down Town Los Angeles are amazing. There are a few signs up providing more information about what you can see. I’m imagining extremely great views after a good rain storm clears the sky of all our smog and dirt....</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>Usually don’t have any problems with this place but recently went in and asked for a pepperoni pizza with light sauce. The girl handed one to me that was already made and said “here we already have one with light sauce”.. isn’t that a coincidence that they already had one with light sauce or did she just hand me one already pre-made so she didn’t have to make me a new one? When I got the pizza, it was overflowing with sauce, probably the most sauce I’ve ever gotten in a pizza. Will not be going back to this location.<//text></record>

< review>
The customer service at this location is very pleasant everything was made correctly in my sub sandwich was so tasty. The only thing that could ever have to say about this location is it could be a little more up-to-date, neater and cleaner than it is but I also think it could be because its an old building.< /review>

<Review>For take and bake the pizza is good. I am a bigger fan of their subs, but they don't have a huge selection like traditional sub shops. The main draw here is you can use food stamps to get wings or pizza or subs only place I know of besides a grocery store that you can. Staff was kind and helpful got my order just right thanks.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80945e7a80d8bec1:0xcf0a642ec3dfde11< /Gmap_id><response>None< /response>< date>

<Review>The team at Schuck’s are amazing.  My family and I were moving and in a tight time restraint to pick up a cap over camper out of state.  Schuck’s went out of there way to make our trip happen.  They diagnosed, repaired and delivered our truck with a new transmission in days, even traveling to intercept a part stuck in transit. I can’t thank them enough for hard work and dedication.  I will definitely call upon them for any future needs I might have.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Took my 88 Ford Bronco 2 to Schuck's Transmission a few weeks ago after AAMCO botched a rebuild in 2012. Jeff and his team were very courteous. Jeff took the time to hear me out about the 2-3 shift flare and how I had tried the band adjustment and shift modulator replacement with no improvement before I decided to bring it in for professional repair. Jeff was honest with me about the amount of work it would need. After the repairs, I was able to get a box of the parts that were replaced. While the transmission was being rebuilt, they also replaced the flywheel due to some broken teeth. I inspected their work afterwards and was very pleased to the attention to detail. The shift adjustment nuts on this A4LD are prone to loosening so I saw that Jeff's team had put some gasket on thise after adjustment.

Lesson learned, don't take your transmission to AAMCO for a cheap rebuild. Schuck's has been a good experience and Jeff was willing to take my calls and answer any questions I had. He even provided me with the manuals for the shift kit they installed to improve the shifting after rebuild. I also saw the aftermath of the botched rebuild in the worn bands and worn out center support that was replaced.

I can rest easy now that Schuck's transmission did the job right.<//review>

I took my vehicle to Shucks Transmission for transmission work after reviewing the online business referrals.  Initially I was a little apprehensive since this was not a personal reference.  Based on the good service and workmanship provided, I would definitely recommend the business.  The thing that stuck with me the most was their honesty and the fact that they honored their warranty without issue.< /Text>

Been going here for 23 years an I put his transmission to the test street raceing or towing I tell him what I want it to do an they make it happen priceing is very fair when you compare to what another shop will give you an what they give you. An if its repairable they repairs it unlike most shops. Thumbs up 👍 five star shop</text>

<text>I had my transmission replaced in my 2009 JKU wrangler by Schucks. I cannot say enough good things about this shop. They went above and beyond my expectations, and not once did I have any doubts about the service I was receiving. This was a performance/mod scenario, and they delivered! Jeep is running great now, and I'm still discovering little items that they went above and beyond and corrected for me, when they could have easily just said thats not my problem. Thanks again! You have a new lifetime customer now!< /text>< Pics>

They seem honest and will assess your situation before telling you how much they charge-they are insistent on their methods so they can save you money.</Text>

<review>Went in for a P0340 (camshaft position sensor) & P0401 insufficient exhaust recirculation).  Knowledgeable staff, knew exactly what I was speaking of on the phone unlike three others left unnamed.  The job was correctly at a good price and in a timely fashion.  Good job guys!  The 96' green Ranger is running great!  Cheers!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Schuck's Transmission is on point! I won't go anywhere else and you shouldn't either if you want loyal A+ Technicians and people you can trust handling your repairs. They've been a staple in the East bay for decades, come highly recommended by many in the race and performance field and they deliver on their reputation. A big thanks to Jeff and company for their honesty and skill.

Purchased a remanufactured transmission for my Explorer. Schuck's made sure that I had fluid, gaskets and everything needed for the installation, all included. I was back on the road in less than a week. Fair prices and a well run shop. Drove an hour and a half to get that transmission and will do it again when I need my next one. Highly recommend.< /Review>

< review>
300% MARKUP on parts used during repair and a THREE WEEK turnaround time? What an embarrassment of a shop. I've waited several months to write this review so that I could evaluate the work done on my automobile. With that said, I highly recommend that you take your automobile elsewhere. It's wise to look outside of the tri-valley area, because the local shops here will rip you off. My classic car was returned to me in an arguably worse condition. It certainly drives a lot worse than when I handed it over to Robert--horrible vibrations. He then had the audacity to justify mark-ups on parts that were ordered from a manufacturer's website (see the attached image). Furthermore, I was never asked which replacement parts I wanted installed on my vehicle. The shop only called me to update the process a single time; I initiated almost all communication during this drawn out process. The total cost was about $500 over-budget (see the attached picture of the poorly written ticket). I don't even think I should make a warranty claim with Schuck's... I'd hate to let my car go for another two months. If you must go to a local shop, go to Broadway motors located on the same block as Schuck's. Do not get scammed here. My friends and I don't call it Schuck's, or truck's, or luck's.... starts with a C!<//review>

<name>Julie Rowan<//name><Review>Found out our landscape drains were clogged and our pool project was haulted. I called Colepepper Plumbing and they got me on the schedule the same day. They called ahead to let us know that they were coming and Alex our tech, was great. He was so thorough and was determined to help us get what we needed done, done. We found that one side is actually capped off but Alex got the other side flowing, even found a little army man that washed out of the drain. Alex was very nice, very professional and easy going. The pricing was very competitive and they even offer a Military Discount. Thank you Colepepper Plumbing! Our project can start right back up. We are so grateful for Alex and Colepepper.</Review><rate>5< /rate>< Pics>

They came out and took care of us, temporarily restored water and then promptly came back the next morning and fixed the issue, while also spotting other items that needed fixing to avoid future problems. This is the second time we’ve used Colepepper and, as a woman, I have never felt like they were trying to sell to me or manipulate my lack of plumbing knowledge. They explained the issues in a way I could understand and answered all my questions thoroughly. We would highly recommend this company!<//Review>< pics>

The cold water supply valve to our hot water heater starting shooting water at 8:30 on a Saturday night. I called several other companies that all wanted $250+ just to come out. Isaiah with Colepepper came out at 9:30 to work on it but didn’t have parts needed to fix the issue. BUT he was out again on Sunday morning with the needed parts and got everything fixed.

I am so grateful that we now have water back after a long night! I will have no reservations contacting Colepepper in the future.

Below you can see the old corroded pipe and the new pipe with the correct shut off valve installed by Isaiah.<//Review>

Actually Victor gave me a quote that I gave to my landlord to see what he wanted to do. But I wanted to mention that Victor was extremely professional very courteous he really knew what he was doing and he had excellent plumbing advice. Truly that is so appreciated and I hope my landlord agrees to get the work done. Thank you Victor very much for your expertise and your kindness</review>

I chose Colepepper plumbing based on hearing them all the time on 97.3 The Fan and they seemed like a small, good, local company.

Within an hour of calling Colepepper their tech Allan came out. He came at 4pm on a Friday and diagnosed a broken water heater. I cannot say enough good things about Allan.  He gave me many options and was willing to start immediately. I request a few days later for scheduling reasons but I was Impressed with his willingness to stay late on a Friday to work hard to restore hot water ASA

I did not research costs of other companies installing one due to having a newborn in the house but the cost Allan quoted seemed reasonable especially considering the labor it was going to take to instal in my unique space.

When he came today he was prompt, polite, and hardworking.

He was patient to answer may many questions and I would recommend him and will be using Colepepper for other plumbing needs.<//review>

We had a build up of corrosion on the pipes servicing the 100 gallon water heater at our apartment building. Allan checked out the situation and was able to come back the following day to cut out and replace the 1” pipe, union, and shut-off valve. We went ahead and also replaced the 30+ years old pressure regulator and building shut-off. Best to be proactive! He was able to re-position the pipe so it didn’t sit on the water heater vent (like it was before), and left the job site clean. I must say, he did some beautiful work. He thoroughly explained what he was going to do beforehand and did an excellent job.</text>

I showed him the clogged kitchen sink and the clean-out drain. I described the problem and he asked a few questions and he explained what the problem was.
He documented the problem and gave me a quote.
He came back with the snake and cleaned out my drain for their advertised price. I was very happy.
I asked him lots of questions and he was very patient and friendly in answering all of my questions. He explained how the house drain lines run and feed into each other and then feed out into the main city sewer pipes. He explained how the equipment he used works and how the drain clog builds up over time.
I feel like I learned something about plumbing!
He explained and offered their “whole house drain clean out service” and although I did not purchase the service at this time, I am considering it from his recommendation. He was not pushy or using hard-upsell methods like some other companies.
I definitely did not get that feeling with Stan. I was left with a very satisfied and confident feeling that he is trustworthy and honest.
I feel very confident recommending Stan or hiring him again for my future needs. Thank you Stan!</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1619573976338, 'text': 'Thanks'}</Resp>< gmapID>

This was a routine annual tankless water heater maintenance call.  The service tech was on time, very tidy, professional in appearance and skill, and personable.  Nothing complicated about this job, but he did it efficiently without “cutting corners.”

I asked for his name, because I will specifically request him the next time I need a plumber!< /text>

Thank you Stan! He was professional and knowledgeable of the issue. He took care of the job that was asked. I appreciate the suggestions he gave and that is definitely taken into consideration. The next time I have an issue I will reach out to Stan at Colepepper Plumbing.< /Text>

<text>I was honestly a bit worried when our downstairs toilet got clogged. I remembered about the 71$ advertisement from Colepepper plumbing and gave them a call that Sunday evening.  Colepepper were very professional from the moment I called till the moment they finished the job. Alfonso came out and was just great. He explained and showed me what the problem was, gave me the comfort that he had everything under control and took care of the problem in minutes. I would most definitely recommend Colepepper plumbing to anyone looking for the best.</text>< Pics>

Our garbage disposal unit needed to be replaced. I purchased one from Home Depot. Called the local Colepepper office. When the plumber arrived, I shared the information him and asked for an installation estimate. He was very professional, and respectful. However , the quote to replace the  unit was $430 or $450,  I forget. Half an hour labor to disconnect one unit and reconnect another!  Needless to say, the work was done by another party for $80 in less the 30 minutes.</Text>

These people were amazing!!! We just moved into a new house and had a problem with a gas leak in our laundry room that required some further repairs, way over our head.  I called Cole Pepper because they had the best reviews, they sent someone over within an hour and a half and the fixed the problem free of charge.  Now we can wash and dry all of our children's clothes.  Would highly recommend hands down!! Will use again for anything we need in the future!</review>

<Review>We contacted Colepepper Plumbing on Saturday evening  and they were able to confirm an appointment for Saturday morning to diagnose a couple of drains that we backing up. The company assigned the job to their technician, Billy Li, who was prompt, pleasant and extremely professional.  Billy worked on our issue for over 4 hrs and took time to check-in with us on a frequent basis for status checks.  Billy found the problem and addressed it to our satisfaction.  I highly recommend Billy Li and Colepepper should you ever require plumbing services.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1606692893902, 'text': 'Thx!'}<//resp><GmapID>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a<//GmapID></record>

<text>There were so many issues with this company. One being, they did not honor their military discount when asked. They did not honor their 30 day warranty. They did not honor their 100% customer satisfaction guaranteed for a refund. We hired them due to a clogged toilet at our rental property. We were told they needed to hydro jet the pipes which cost around $1,660. We decided to go through with them because our tenants needed a toilet, of course. Stan, the technician told us and our tenants that there was a 30 day guaranteed warranty if the problem occurs again. A week later, the same problem occurs. We called back the technician, Stan, to let him know the situation. Stan then proceeds to tell us that we are going to need to replace our pipes and quoted us for around 8,400. We asked if they could honor their warranty and do the hydro jetting again and Stan told us that it would be pointless because the pipes needed to be replaced (this is without re-checking the pipes). We asked for our money back from the hydro jetting since it didn’t work and he told us that he could only give us $500 back towards the 8,400 project. Not only did they offer back this pitiful amount, it was towards another expensive project instead of directly to us. After this quote, we did not hear anything else back from Stan. We contacted 3 more plumbing companies and received quotes for the issue. We were told that the pipes did not need to be replaced, especially being that the building was only built in 2004. All companies said there was nothing wrong with the pipes which proved that Colepepper was trying to take advantage of the situation and get as much money as they could. I contacted the company and got a response from Dan. Dan then proceeds to tell us that he will not refund the full amount and will only do 10% since the military discount wasn’t calculated. So now it went from $500 to about $160. I am absolutely disgusted by this company and would not recommend anyone to use them.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Main issue: my contact with this company has been based on the failure of deliver functions purchased in a new home build. Not sure who or where and since both parties will not take responsibility ..2 Stars.

So in fairness:  the good:
Great, friendly people. Excellent attempts to help a non-plumber with issues. If it was based just on that I probably would give 4 stars.
and, the bad:
- Plumber showed up, unannounced. This could have been on them, or on the home builder, but it affected the review.
- He was there to try and talk us out of getting what we paid for, in substitution for similar functionality without IMO adequate experience and comfort with the product that he was 'selling' us.
- Debris from work done was not cleaned up. I've pulled stucco and such out of my hvac fans after having holes cut through the external walls. I've had to catch water as pipes were not fit and provided the correct bends. This last work, I'm still finding dry wall that was cut out for a new control unit.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>Stan was/is awesome.

He was on time and very efficient.  He explained everything to me and showed examples.  The nicest plumber i have worked with,  will definitely use your company again.  Hope all the employees are as nice and know their job as good as Stan.

Thank you so much.  I will refer your company to anyone that needs a plumber!!!

Stan was awesome. He was straightforward with what the issue may have been, talked directly to my landlord to get approval for what he wanted to do and then did it. I am grateful for his expertise and help. I highly recommend him for any plumbing issue you may have!< /Text>

Stan came out to our residence in Santee. He was prompt, courteous, and Covid safe. This was a estimate for a major issue with the main water line from street to house. Stan went through every step of the process and gave us an immediate estimate. Stan is a great representative of the Colepepper Company.<//text>

He showed us how the pipe was pinched by a tree root. We understood that it was going to be a big repair so he got us a quote for the complete job.

Thank you for helping us get to the root of the problem. Pun intended.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1613022903688, 'text': 'Thx'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a</gmap_id></record>

We had a big problem with our kitchen sink this morning & called Colepepper.  Billy was our technician that came out earlier than scheduled & he was amazing.  He was very professional & had our drain unclogged in less than an hour.  I am very pleased with Colepepper’s quick response & in the future we will always call you for any work we need done - I will also request Billy if I can get him for the job!  Thanks again for the great service I received from your company & staff - I will highly recommend your company to our family & friends.<//text>

Today we had the pleasure of having Stan S. perform plumbing repairs at our home. Stan was very prompt, polite, professional and thorough in the work that he performed and in his explanation of same.  We would highly recommend Colepepper Plumbing for any household plumbing problems.  We would suggest that you request Stan S. as your technician because he exceeded our expectations.

He took the time to explain what he was going to do and what he was doing as he worked on the clogged drain. He showed me what was going on inside the drain by having me check out the camera screen. He further explained options I have for a future, more permanent solution. Moreover, he advised me to get a new cleanout cap and described the kind of cap I need since the threads on the cast iron are stripped. And even though he was at my home to unclog the drain, he also diagnosed a problem with my dishwasher and told me how I could fix it. I'm very happy with the service I received from Allan from Colepepper Plumbing. I'll definitely be calling him for my future plumbing needs. I almost forgot to mention that the bill was less than half the cost quoted by two other companies I called.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1605558913076, 'text': 'Thank you!'}< /resp><gmapID>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a<//gmapID></record>

Stan was a great plumber to work with. Provided advice notice of his arrival,  quickly evaluated and set up equipment, answered all my questions,  got my old drain system working ok, and provided recommendations for long term reliability.

Stan was awsome and took great care of us. He is the reason you guys will receive a call on my next plumbing issue.
Thanks again

<rating>5< /rating><text>On Weds night, I noticed there wasn't any hot water. Of course I looked it up on YouTube thinking I would be able to fix the problem. My first thought was the pilot light was out and I needed to re-light it. It worked but it went out a few minutes later. I noticed the light flashing and checked the code on the front panel. According to the number of flashes, the burner assembly needed to be replaced. Colepepper Plumbing immediately came to mind because of the ad I hear on the radio all the time. Sorry but it's so annoying that it stuck in my head. Anyway, I called and Alex came out the next day. He assessed the situation, and agreed the burner needed to be replacement. He called his boss Mitch to confirm. Mitch was upfront and told me I should call the manufacturer since the water heater was only 2 yrs old and should be under warranty. He told me it would be more cost effective for me to do that, instead of paying more money to have them order the part. The new part arrived yesterday and Alex came back this morning to replace the burner. Not only is Alex polite and professional, he is very compassionate. I had a meltdown when he originally came out because my mom and uncle passed away a few weeks ago, one of our cars was stolen and my dad went to ER a few nights ago. All this and the water heater malfunctioning sent me over the edge. He was patient, understanding and offered words of encouragement and comfort. During this crazy and unnerving time, my faith in humanity was restored. The bottom line is this: Alex is an amazing individual and Colepepper is very fortunate to have him. I highly recommend this company. They are honest, fair and have good people working for them. Their pricing  is more than fair. I called another company and they told me the cost for the repair would be at least $400. Mitch quoted me a much better price. Next time you have plumbing issues, definitely give them a call and ask for Alex. He did a great job but more importantly, he went out of his way to be kind and caring. It's not something you experience these days, especially with service people. Good on you Colepepper Plumbing!</text>< Pics>

Yes I understand it was an after hours call at 6:30 pm and it took them 1 hr to replace this angel stop.  THEY CHARGED AN 82 YR OLD LADY $446!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $347 for the part and install, (1 hr install) and a $90 after hours call.  I get the $90 after hours call charge, BUT $347 FOR A $10 PART AND A 1 HR INSTALL????????  I DO NOT RECOMEND THEM AND WILL NOT USE THEM IN THE FURTURE.</Review>< Time>

They sent a technician right away. He was professional, nice and knowledgeable.  He had to make another trip for a longer snake, I still only got charged the advertised price. These guys are now my GO TO plumbers. Excellent service. Alan was the tech and he could not have been nicer. Great experience.</review>

< Review>
I call Colepepper due to washer was  water coming out from bottom of washer and flooding everywhere. Stan was the one who come to our house. He has mask on and was very friendly. Even checked our water pressure valve(  found issue ), give us 3 options. Normally that service would be charge to us but he didnt.  Quoted the price and  the warranty that would come with .  And, informed us that what is included for each option. Family and I will discuss the option to see which works for best for us.</Review>

Fast, thorough, and exactly as advertised. They unclogged my drain, diagnosed the problem should it fallen again and charged me $71 as advertised. It was money well spent. Thanks< /text>

<review>I rarely post a review but was so disgusted that I wanted to share my experience.  My toilet tank needed some parts replaced so I called for service.  The technician confirmed that several parts needed to be replaced and he would need to go purchase them.  He told me he would go out to his van to work up a quote.  I anticipated that with labor and parts it would be less than $200.  When he finally came back, he began by trying to sell me an entire new toilet system at a cost of approximately $2,000.  I was flabbergasted and told him I would not be using their services.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<text>We were searching for a qualified technician to install a toilet we purchased to reduce our cost. Called around and received the usual runaround from the local competition. However, George sent over Kenny today and BOOM, his professionalism from the time he knocked on the door to his honesty, cleanliness and explanation of what was required was welcomed. This team from Colepepper and Kenny have made us a client for all our plumbing needs. Thanks Guys!</text><user_name>Carlos Normandia<//user_name>< rating>

<text>Stay away from this plumbing company!!  Poor, poor value / rip off artists.  See picture below, they charged an extra 648 dollars to patch a 10"x12" patch of concrete.  It probably took them 20 minutes and half a bag of Quikrete (8 dollars a bag) if that.  Spoke with owner on the phone and he said "because the job took longer (which is their plumber's fault) that it all evens out in the end".  Also another lame excuse that they had to call out the city... I was there when they came for all of 15 mins and it had nothing to do with the job cost...just bad justification for them to overcharge a customer.  I gave them every chance to make it right before this review.  If this is any indication on how the do business, take yours elsewhere!  So, so disappointed in this company and blatant/crazy overcharge!!! And let me add one more thing, I am the property manager...it wasn't even my money.  We'll take all your money...we're Colepepper Plumbing!<//text>< Rating>

{'time': 1605627939804, 'text': "We had given you options before we began the job to patch the concrete or to not patch it. You choose to patch it. The job grew more difficult and got into the night time. We had to call the city out to do an emergency shut off on the meter. We didn't charge you any extra for any of this. As you hovered over our technician the entire job, that certainly didn't make the job go any quicker. When the job was done you called to complain about the price. You said you were happy with the work and the tech, but wanted a discount and if we didn't give you one that you would write a bad review on the internet. We consider this blackmail, hence the 1 star review. Please don't call us again."}< /Response>

I have read some of the prior reviews talking about their prices. Yes it is true that they are higher priced than other companies. But clearly the posters have never had bad plumbers before. We used to hire cheap plumbers, and it was always a terrible experience and the plumbing never lasted long. Colepepper is more, but they have quality plumbers and warranty's that make me feel comfortable. You get what you pay for<//Text>

<text>Colepepper pluming came to the rescue. I am the property manager of our complex. One of are units was experiencing a clog in the bathtub. Unfortunately our regular service plumber company kinda gave us the run around and almost a week without it being solved. The waste and over flow were in bad condition and along had a blockage farther down the line. They got their hydro jetter guy to come out and push the blockage down the line and got our overflow replaced (much needed)They  provided me with videos and images. This is an old building so that’s expected.  We will definitely used them for future pluming issues. Just remember if you have old buildings/old pipes it’s life expectancies are near the end. So time to get it fixed . Thanks Allan and leo!"<//text><GmapID>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a</GmapID>< Time>

This is the second time we have used Colepepper plumbing. They were really easy to get in touch with and the plumber arrived within the window that I had provided. He was friendly and clearly explained the problem. I was happy with how the job was completed- in a reasonable amount of time, and for the quoted price. Would definitely use them the next time we have a plumbing need!</review>

I reached out to Colepepper plumbing to receive a bid for some repairs that were listed on a home inspection report for a home my wife and I are trying to buy on a Saturday. I was told that they could for sure assist me, and have a plumber out between 10-2 on Sunday, and they would call about 30 min before they arrived. We reached out to our agent so the sellers could be ready as well.

I called at 11 on the day of the appointment to confirm it. I was told yes we were confirmed it would be another hour.

I called at 12:30 to follow up as it had been over an hour. I was told that they had a lot of calls and I was next.

I called at 1:30 again to see what the ETA was, as we were trying to coordinate this with the owners. I was told I was next and they would be arriving shortly.

Anyways, 4pm arrives, 2 hours outside of their four hour window. And they say they should have someone over in another hour or so... we needed to reschedule for Monday.

Monday arrives, the plumber arrives to the home before I do, and does not call. Walks through the home with the seller, then leaves.

I call the office to have the plumber return, and provided a copy of the inspection report outlining the multiple issues that arose, and requested a bid on the items. The plumber says okay, we'll take this to the office and send it back to you later today.

Monday evening, no bid. I call the office to request the bid, and they send over a blank estimate stating everything is in working order, and addressing none of the issues on the report provided. I reply with a copy of the report again and request they update to reflect the items, and call back in to request it. They say they will send it right away.

Tuesday - still no bid. Was sent another bid for the cost of an expansion tank... not listed anywhere on my request. I've been calling the office over and over just to be told that they need to reach out to someone else and get back to me.

Every time I call in they are unapologetic, and offer nothing in the way of timelines on this issue to be corrected.</text>

<review>The main water line going to the sewer broke in my house. It was a huge job that was going to take up to 10 days to do. Our technician Isaiah was awesome. Super polite and professional. He not only did a great job on the repair but worked tirelessly around the clock and got the job done in 4 days! Highly recommended him and this company!!< /review></record></dataset><record>

They were great and did an awesome job over the course of time that it took to finish all work.  They come out immediately and are professional and knowledgeable.  Great team and my family and I would refer them to neighbors any chance we had!!

We recently had a bunch of problems back to back from a broken dishwasher and toilet to a leaking faucet and water under the kitchen sink.  Colepepper plumbing was very responsive and they came out immediately and did an inspection, ordered parts and took care of everything for a very reasonable price.  Kenny was our technician and he was very knowledgeable and efficient.  He took care of everything within a couple of days including ordering a new dishwasher and installation. I would use them again in a heart beat.  I highly recommend!<//text>

We had a clogged main line. They determined that the line had failed due to decades of wear and tear. The 3 men worked tirelessly for a few days to make the needed repairs. We are so greatful to them. That work looked so hard. I can't imagine doing it. We are now back and in good working order.</text>

Colepepper Plumbing is above what I expected. Adolfo arrived on time and was polite and profession. He stared to work within minutes and solved the clogged drain. It was a tough job. I clearly felt he would have worked all day until I was happy and the problem solved, Highly recommended. Adolfo has a great attitude and seemed to take pride in his work.<//Review>

My mother in law used them before for some plumbing repairs and I've heard their radio commercials, so I decided to give them a call for my clogged tub. They pulled out a hairball that must've been 2 feet long. They educated me to not put my hair down the drain, especially since I have old drain pipes from the 1950s, since they tend to clog up more often.</Text>

<text>Colepepper came to the rescue, as scheduled, when our toilet plugged and leaked out the base. It was clogged past the reach of my 6 foot snake. And it obviously needed to have the base resealed. They took care of it quickly with courtesy and helpful suggestions for future maintenance. I'll be keeping them on my go-to list<//text>< Date>

<Text>Great work.  I called about my kitchen plumbing.  I love cooking so over time, the pipes servicing my kitchen got clogged with oil and grease.  The specialist they sent was Victor and he was wonderful.  Very respectful, professional, and patient; he took the time to explain everything he did to solve my problem and how to prevent it moving forward.  They ended up having to open my garage wall to create an access for the kitchen drain so that moving forward it would be easier to hydro-cear or snake.  I did spend more than I anticipated but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for.  With the more permanent solution instead of the band-aid, this option comes with a 5 year warranty.  I recommend this place if you want your work done right.<//Text>< Pics>

Contacted them at 7 am on a Tuesday morning for an emergency water leak at our business. We had a mess on our hands. They referred us to a great company who helped clean up all the damage while they (Colepepper) fixed the busted water pipe. Although it was expensive (as I imagined it would be), I wouldnt have had any other company do the work. Kudos to Colepepper</Review>

<Text>We had a problem where our tub would not turn off. I called Colepepper and they helped us out immediately. They were able to come ASAP that day, assessed the problem, assessed our overall plumbing system in the house, made suggestions and got right to work. The tech, William, did a great job and explained everything before and after completing the work. He was respectful of us and our home. I would highly recommended Colepepper for any plumbing issues.</Text>< rating>

Can't be happier with the service from Colepepper. They were courteous from the very first phone call until they left (which ended up being 3 days later...it was a big job). What impressed me most was how clean they left the work site. They cleaned up all their trash and left the area spotless.<//Text>

The $200 was a low price to do the work. He was there for a few hours. It seemed as if you were trying to get a bunch of free work out of us. The $200 did solve the problem, and you decided to go with Home Depot to replace the water heater. Nothing wrong with that. However, I can tell you we have fixed many, many of their water heater installation screw ups"}< /Response>
<Time>1585388094555</Time><review>Had low water pressure coming out of water heater. Guy who showed up had little clue and was throwing guesses all over the place. Had to keep talking to his boss on phone again and again. Boss told him to bypass heater to confirm if plumbing was ok. Good idea, but charged me freaking $200 for it, just too disconnect and reconnect two pipes. And refused to try to clean/fix the heater, quoted a minimum of $2200 for replacement.

Insanity. Scammed for $200. Lesson learnt. Absolutely avoid this company. Go with local recommendations.< /review></record>

Was referred to them by a neighbor. Our kitchen drain got clogged from my wife putting too much celery down the drain. They recommended to not put that down the drain but in the trash. Thanks for the tip!</Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I have a 50 year-ish old  home in San Diego with old pipes and a history of backed up plumbing.  Several companies have been out over the years, however, it  has not been mentioned to replace or reline the pipes.  Continual clearing, jetting of the lines finally came down to a permanent solution.  My tenant called Colepepper out.  The invoice said they descaled the line [it is questionable that this was done], camera'd it, dug and replaced about 5' of pipe, then made recommendations.  They also pulled a toilet and reset it.  The bill was $1700.  [The line had already been jetted about 2-3 months previous].   They sent over an estimate detailing 5 options for a permanent solution ranging from $20,000 to $65,000.  The option they recommended most was the 4th most expensive at $36,000.  This was to reline the major portion of the drain line.This is a lot of money, so I called out some other people for estimates.  3 subsequent reputable companies each quoted about the same amount and the same work for about 25% what Colepepper bid.  So my obvious choice is not Colepepper.  The office rang me discuss payment for work done and asked what bids I had gotten from other companies.  I told them and was then asked if Colepepper would meet those bids would I work with them?  I said absolutely not.  I am not going to work with a company who drops their price from $40,000 to $10,000.  Seriously?  After reading numerous online reviews they seem to be split.  For the most part customers say their work was great and fast, but then there are numerous 1 star reviews or price gouging.  My husband is a contractor, so I am well aware of the tactics some contractors use.  It is altogether possible for 2 highly respected and competent contractors, known for honesty and integrity to have bids where one may be double what the other was.  Many things come into play.  A small company that doesn't have a lot of office and marketing overhead may charge a lot less but do a bang-up job.  The larger company has marketing, payroll, employee benefits, and on down the line to cover so they have to charge more.  But not 4 times more.
Beware.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1605627065694, 'text': "You are comparing apples and oranges. Our scope of work included many things the other companies did not.

Had an appointment scheduled for Tuesday (4 hour window) and they called me right at the 4 hour mark to let me know they were running late. I told them no problem and if it was easier for them I’d be happy to reschedule for another day, which they accepted because they were so behind. I told them if I rescheduled for another day I wanted a 2 hour window because I didn’t want to waste another day waiting. The nice gentleman said he would definitely make a note of that and really make sure to do that for me because I was so kind to reschedule.
Sure enough 4 hours later still hadn’t heard anything. I wasted 2 days waiting around for them, so I cancelled my appointment and went with another company. If you are too busy, it’s best to be honest with your customers and schedule accordingly.</text>

I can't say enough about this company and Dylan, who came out to give us an estimate on installing a tankless water heater. He was polite, respectful, and knowledgeable and bent over backwards to help us with the most reasonable estimate being that we are on tight fixed incomes. I would highly recommend Colepepper Plumbing!</review>

They unclogged a toilet for us. The technician called and arrived early; fixed the problem and we were back in business within about 2 hours. Fast, efficient service. The price was fair; not cheap. I have a problem with their call center phone answering. The connection was poor so communication was difficult. The person who answered had no idea about local towns.  I had to talk the to the ordering dept and then after a brief exposure to music, the scheduling dept. I almost hung up and looked for another plumber.</text>

What  shame.  On Saturday morning we called and were told they were so busy they couldn't give an appointment until Sunday.  We were given an appointment for today (Sunday) with a a window of between 10 and 2.  So we waited.  First call we were told there were emergency call and he a lot of water heater emergencies and would likely not get to us until after five.  Five o'clock come and no call no show.  My husband calls and we were told there were too many emergencies today and he wouldn't be able to get to us.  Really cruddy that they didn't honor our appointment.   Meanwhile my entire kitchen is in complete disarray because they didn't show up.  Moreso, there was not one apology.  "Tell the gang we're coming" only if you have an emergency that is going to make them a lot of money.  I wanted to give a new, seemingly local person a chance.  I blew it.  WIll stay with ASI forever.< /Review>

<Text>***Buyer Beware!***  Stay away from this company - far away!  They will rip you off - identify work that is not necessary, create a sense of urgency, and charge exorbitant rates.  They had a plumber onsite with a compression fitting - angle stop in hand and quoted $489 to replace existing.  $18 at Home Depot, and any homeowner can install in 10 minutes.  Because of this ridiculous quote, I got quotes on past work they had done for me and realized that they charged me five times the going rate for a water filtration system that they installed.  I wish I had done my research and read the reviews before.  I now see that many others have experienced the same from Colepepper Plumbing - READ YELP REVIEWS!  Unethical, shameless and corrupt.<//Text>< Pics>

The high quality of work you’d expect from a plumbing company when you need it. Bryon came out to our house on a Sunday morning and was punctual, the definition of courteous and very informative. He repaired a leaking water line that had already caused damage to drywall/cabinets/carpet. Let us know that they have mitigation capabilities for the subsequent damage (our homeowners insurance already set that up with another company) and that they could take care of us from start to finish, which was great to know. We couldn’t have asked for better service than what we received from Bryon at Colepepper Plumbing. They worked with us on pricing (I was taken back when over the phone they said there was no service charge for assessment and quote, which every other company had one close to $100) Highly recommend them, and we will definitely be using them in the future for our plumbing needs. Thank you, Colepepper Plumbing.</Text>

<text>I called Colepepper Plumbing on 3 December 2019 around 11am. Talking with the phone representative as asked what is cost to have the drained unclogged.

“$71 from any accessible access.” Said the rep.
“ Does that include the roof vent?” I asked
“ Any accessible access”. He said
“So does that include the roof?” I asked
“Yes if it is accessible”. He said
“ It is. I asking because historically this drain had only been able to be cleared from the roof and this where they will need to snake the drain”. I said.

The technicians showed up at the house today around 11am. I showed them the bathroom. He flushed the toilet a few times.  The toilet filled up.

“That drain a clogged before and snaking from the roof has been the only thing to work” I said

The technician which I assumed was going through protocol wanted to try to snake from within the house and the clean-out in the front yard.  Neither worked.

“Will have to pull the toilet and snake from there” said the technician

“Before we pull the toilet give me a quote to replace the plumbing for the toilet under the house” I said

There is a crawl space that is easily accessible. The tech received authorization from his supervisor over the phone. Went under the house took pictures called his supervisor to get a quote.

In the meantime, it the hope to be able to use the toilet and shower we pulled the toilet.  Once again failing to clear the clog.  In fact the snake went up and out the roof vent and over the side of the house.

Again the tech call his supervisor.  Afterward came back into the house.

“It will cost around $3200 to repair the pipe under the house” said the tech.

“And can you snake the roof vent?” I asked

“It will cost $380 to go into the roof and snake the vent” the tech said

Now a simple drain clearing from the price negotiated over the phone with Colepepper plumbing which started at $71 was inflated to $380.

I want to note the technician were great and work within the constrain for the employer. After the technicians left I called Colepepper around 1:45 and spoke to the phone representative and explained the situation.

Basically his answer was sorry.  A drain cleaning from an accessible clean out is $71. He also noted that the phone rep is not a technician and can not provide pricing over the phone.

Now, the drain is still clogged, the toilet is off the floor which is fine I removed it for them, and I am out $71.

I am not saying never use this company but don’t Expect Colepepper Plumbing to honor over the phone pricing.  And before their employees start working have the pricing in writing and not the word of one of the company representatives.

Good luck with your plumbing needs.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a<//GmapID></record>

This is the 3rd time we have used Colepepper Plumbing. They are fast to answer the phone and always polite. I would recommend anybody there to come out to your house.<//review>

Be wary of their prices, $71.00 is for perfectly accessible, ideal, and easy clog situations. If you have an old standard(small) cleanout, roof vents, or other situations the price skyrockets. They flat out refused to use our cleanout (1949 cast iron, now substandard size) with no exception and wanted to pull the toilet. Somewhat understandable, but that required supervisor approval. The supervisor took his own initiative to inspect all our plumbing under the house and determined it was too corroded and needed to be completely replaced for over $9100 and some change. He then tried to defraud us by claiming the dryout powder used by another company when we had a hot water leak fixed was toilet paper from all of the massive leaks in the pipes (note: it had also rained recently). Yes, the pipes are old and are going to need replacing... but these guys.

On a side note, one of the plumbers was getting sick (just the sniffles he said) and ended up making me sick that lasted from the Saturday after Christmas all the way through New Years. Thanks for that extra service.

Pro: they didn't do anything, so they didn't charge.<//Text>

Won't give an estimate to replace a water heater.  Not even a ballpark estimate.  They have no idea what it costs?  None?  They obviously have some idea what it costs.  All businesses do.</review>

We called several companies to get bids on our water heater replacement. Not only did they come in with the best price, but they had the best warranty as well. We later found out that they did the best quality work too (we compared it to several of our neighbors who had their water heaters replaced). 5 star experience</Text>

Excellent job. We have been having problems with our drains for years. Mitch and Nick came out and fixed the problem and dripped some knowledge on me.

Edit:
Some people have mentioned the price it cost for this company to come out and do work. True, I could have spent $75 instead of the almost $1500 I spent on having my home warranty pick someone to snake 3 drains and use a camera down my main drain but I wanted the job done right the first time by a company I trusted.<//review>

Mitch at Colepepper was fantastic at responding to our early-Sunday-morning water heater emergency.  He arrived at our house within an hour of calling him, explained what was wrong and what our options were, and answered all our questions.  The next morning, David from Colepepper arrived and did an excellent job installing our new water heater and whole house water filtration system.  Both guys were professional, kind, and fast.< /review>

Armando from Colepepper was legit! Quality work for an amazing price! Its hard to find honest hard workers but Armando looked out for us. I bought the toilet tune up and the $79 for $200 of plumbing work and everything was done quickly and efficiently. Thank you for your professionalism! Definitely will be using this company from now on!</review>

<Text>Our main water line broke, sending water up through the concrete slab near our front porch and flooding our downstairs bath, requiring the water service to be shut off.

Leo from Colepepper came out, gave me a bid, and worked with me to match the price, etc., from another quote. We agreed on details, and Leo said he'd be there the next day.

Leo arrived the next day, and started immediately digging. After some time, Jose showed up, and started working as well.

All work was completed, and a couple minor issues were taken care of right away after my inspection of the work. This included a 16" trench dug in the front yard, where we have rocks, landscape fabric, and sprinklers; removing the concrete directly in front of the stairs at the entry (!); new copper pipe from the street to the garage (replacing the old polybutalene); new valves at the street, in the garage, plus a water bib; replacing the concrete in front of the porch, and restoring the front yard including new fabric, etc.

Jose did a fine job with the concrete. I was worried about this, since it is directly in front of the main entry (see photo). It looks great.

The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because it took longer than promised. Leo kept in touch with me however, and answered all my calls and questions immediately.

Overall, great work! Recommended.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1507088439232, 'text': 'Thank you for all the work Steve!'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Leo my plumber was very knowledgeable, respectful and proficient. Upon his arrival he parked on the street and asked if his truck was parked ok. I really appreciated that because we have a new driveway and I don't want trucks on my driveway. After that he found some other problems that were wrong that I wasn't aware of and asked if I wanted to repair them. I decided to go ahead with it. When he was done, he did a great job of cleaning up and showed me what he did. I will definitely use Leo again. You have a great employee there. Thank you!<//text>

<review>I had no idea how bad the water here was in San Diego. The plumber Josh did a water quality test after he fixed my shower faucet and showed me all the gross stuff in the water. He told me about the benefits of having a whole house filtration system. I decided to buy one. A week later and its amazing. I can drink out of the faucet!<//review>< pics>

Colepepper Services are highly responsive and professional.  I highly recommend their services.  I received a call from my tenant who rents my home in Scripps Ranch. They stated the air conditioner was not working properly. The tile floor was ice cold in a few locations.  Jared, the technician at Colepepper Services came out the same day to inspect and repair the air conditioner.  He called me with electrical issues as well, that needed attention.  He went above and beyond, not only did he service the air conditioner with refrigerant and sealant, but ensured the voltage regular was properly cleaned and installed. He also took photos of the work since I was long distance.  He found a few more electrical items that were neglected all for one reasonable price!  He offered a $50 coupon off for the work as well.  A job well done!</review>

<response>{'time': 1568236558276, 'text': 'First all we appreciate your business Claus. We offer a professional hydro jetting service that takes 2 men and professional heavy duty equipment. We were offering a professional  and long term solution. Sort of like you could pull your tooth yourself or you could go to the dentist and pay a professional to have it done. As for the clean outs. That is something that requires a licensed plumber to do. We cannot compete with unlicensed people on work who do not pull permits. Thank you for your feedback and please feel free to call us in the future if you have any future needs.'}< /response><Review>We had a stubborn clogged sewer line back in December '18 that defied cleaning by a discount sewer cleaning company.  In desperation, I called Colepepper and Nick came out in short order.  I reluctantly accepted their extremely high quote of $889 just to keep my wife happy.  It did involve removing the toilet and the line was cleared. Nick scoped
the line (for free) and pointed out the place in the line where his scope would go no further (that is the reason for the extra star).  He recommended flushing the pipe at a cost of $2000 with the comment that if it was not flushed, it would become clogged again within a few weeks.  I proceeded to flush the pipe myself with a special gadget, and it has not been clogged for 8 months.  I also asked for a bid to install an additional cleanout in my yard to facilitate cleaning of future stoppages without toilet removal.  His quote was $4500.  I subsequently hired a trusted handyman who installed the cleanout for $550 including parts. In summary, I have no quarrel with Colepepper's workmanship only with their usurious charges.< /Review>< time>

We couldn't be more pleased with Colepepper Plumbing's services and their staff.From the very first phone call, we knew they were a different company. They handled the phone conversation well and were very polite. They scheduled the appointment around our schedule and even offered to come on the weekend at no extra charge.We will definitely be using Colepepper Plumbing again. We feel that they are the best plumber in all of San Diego.< /review>

<text>My mothers house is notorious for having plumbing problems. Since her old plumber retired it was time to find a new one. We had seen a truck working at the house across the street and decided to give the office a call. I appreciate that they were straightforward with my mother and treated her with respect. It goes a long way in my book. Job well done.<//text>< pics>

A toilet with a leaking tank needed to be replaced. He gave me options, quoted prices and gave me information about the product that allowed me to make an informed decision. At no time did he pressure me into deciding to purchase the highest priced product.
As he began the installation process, he found that an additional part needed to be replaced. He showed me the problem, a rusted seal, and gave a discounted price for that replacement.
He was conscientious, polite and friendly throughout. I would definitely want him to work for me any time plumbing repairs are needed. He will be sending me a price quote for a shower in a rental house of mine tomorrow.<//text>< Rate>

Had to have hydrojetting done to my area drains that had recently clogged due to the rains. Colepepper spent 5 hours on it. Turns out there was years of dirt and roots built up that made them very stubborn to get out. They stuck with it and did a camera inspection once they were done to show me how clean they got them.< /Review>

Colepepper arranged for a technician to come within 30 minutes. The technician was very knowledgeable and went over the options with me before starting on the job. The service was excellent. The job only took 15 minutes and the downside was that they were much pricier than the usual plumbers I use. I would use them again but only in an emergency.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I scheduled an appointment with Colepepper Plumbing to come to my home today in the 2:00 - 5:00 PM window timeframe and was told by their office that I would receive a call 30 minutes prior to arrival. They did not call me nor did they show up. Not professional!

Mitch contacted me with a sincere apology and asked how they could make it up to me. I decided to give Colepepper Plumbing a second chance.  God knows I've been blessed with second chances. So here we are a week later and my project has been professionally completed (by Sean) at a reasonable price and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Sean also helped me avoid a much more costly fix by contacting a parts supplier who was able to locate valve replacement parts for my 34 year-old shower fixtures, for which I am most grateful. I am now a happy customer and will use Colepepper Plumbing again if the need arises.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>My wife and I couldn't be more happy with the services we received from Colepepper Plumbing. Our drain line for our toilet kept on clogging and we knew it was time that we were going to have to make a permanent fix for it. Although it was not inexpensive, it was well worth the price from Colepepper. They did a fantastic job from start to finish. What impressed me the most was how clean they were. It looked like nothing ever happened and they did an amazing job cleaning up. We will call Colepepper again for future service and will gladly refer them to our friends.</Text><date>1530683828327</date></record>

This was the second slab leak that we had in our rental property. The first one we hired to a well known company in the area who did a bad job and took forever to get it done, so we knew that we would not use them again. We found Colepepper online and decided to call them. They assured us that we wouldn’t experience the same thing as the last company and that they will finish on time and at budget. That they did…great job to Leo and Jose for a job well done. They are excellent employees and I would like the owner to know that. Thank you< /Text>

We have had various plumbing issues with our 30+ year old home in recent years and could not find a plumber that was completely knowledgeable, cared about their work and charged a fair price. Well our search is over. Colepepper was very professional and solved a plumbing problem that 3 other plumbers could not solve. Additionally, they were courteous and reasonably priced. Thank you Colepepper, we will definitely be calling you in the future!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1430936905320, 'text': 'Thank you Jennifer for the great review.

I scheduled an appointment, and my wife took the day off work. They gave us a 4 hour window and said they would call her before coming. When they didn't call or show up, I called them to find out what was going on. Only then did they call my wife with some story about how they couldn't get a hold of us. When she said she'd been home all day and had received no calls, they said they didn't know what happened. While they did apologize and offer to send someone the next day, we declined decided to find a more reliable company.

The only reason I gave them 2-Stars instead of 1 is because they were at least polite when they finally contacted my wife.< /review>

I entered my request online and received a response by phone within the hour. They had a availability for the next  day but it didn't work for my schedule. But they had something the next day. They give you a 3 hour window, but call you with about a 39 minute arrival time. I needed a new hose bib, to replace the old one. Sean arrived, very professional. Explained the process, gave the estimate and began work, waived my right to qait 3 days. He was done within 20 minutes. Receipt by email.
I would highly recommend them. Have used a few plumbers in the area and Colepepper is in my top 2. Thanks a lot. Now I know for sure.</Text>< Pics>

Background:
Water pipe  broken in the front yard. The broken part is under the walkway concrete slab about 4 feet wide and about 20 feet under dirt.
Pros:
Quick response time
Cons:
Minor
- the plumber can't finish a sentence without an "F" word
- the assistance lacked of experience, I overheard the plumber teased his assistance of not knowing how to do simple thing
Major
1) lying
a) Originally, the plumber told me that it was a very complicate work including cutting open the concrete slab and quoted me $8000. But when he fixed it, he dug under the slab instead because he was unable to do the way he mentioned before. Later, he told me a few times to trust him and once he told me that he had done this kind of job more than a thousand time.  To me, that meant that he should know how to fix it at the very beginning. It let me wonder if he purposely deceived me for just getting me to agree on the huge price. (It is just a suspicion.) Btw, afterward I found out that a neighbor got their fixed for $3000.
b) During the work, I told him that I was worried about the insulation didn't cover all the pipe under the slab. The plumber told me that the insulation is just an extra caution. It is not needed. But he did it himself and told me that all part of the pipe under that slab was covered. He even pointed to slab and said the join was right over there. But later when I peeked under the slab, there were at least 8 inches gap without the insulation.
2) workmanship
I agree that the plumber can do soldering. But he was over confidence and didn't check his work thoroughly. There were a tiny hole on the pipe. Possibly, it got punched while being pulled under the slab (just another suspicion). I understand things happened. But the problem was he didn't check it. I was using the leaking for a few days that meant even higher water bill.< /text>

I've used this company twice and they were great!  Both times were emergencies and they showed up quickly (once was early morning), assessed the problem and gave me a solution.  Sean is knowledgeable and funny which helps you feel better about sewage leaking into your basement.  Josh was also friendly and knowledgeable.  The company's prices do seem a little steep but I'm not a certified plumber so I'll continue to pay for their quality services at their rate.</review>

<Text>Highly Recommended.  Great Experience.  Fast, professional, on-time, reasonably priced.  I will use Colepepper Plumbing for my future plumbing needs.  Mitch came up with a simple solution to relocating a gas line.  Other plumbers wanted to make the change extremely complicated.  Colepepper was only plumber I called that was able to make changes to a gas line.  He was quick, reasonably priced, and professional.  I have told several people about him and will continue to do so.  I highly recommend Colepepper Plumbing.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>They educated me on a tankless water heater vs a standard water heater. We didn't realize how big the difference was. After some discussion. we decided to go with the tankless water heater. 1 week in and we are glad we made that decision. It is a big improvement over the older tank style water heater.<//text></record>

<Review>Price Gouging

Be wary of price quotes.  Received three quotes yesterday for minor work.  I had a leak from my toilet tank, that required $40 worth of parts and less than an hour worth of work, priced at $750.  I also asked for a price quote on two shower kits (and installation), approximately $200 for each kit, and another 2 hours of work, priced at $3700.  In total, $440 worth of parts, and 3 hours of work, priced at $4400! And there were 2 other more expensive options!<//Review>< rate>

< Review>
I actually had Chris as a service provider. He is new to the company.  He said he is from Alabama.  He was punctual, cordial, professional, and courteous.  I felt bad because the work was completed outside at the water main.  He arrived in the heat of the day, and we have been experiencing uncommonly warm weather.  He had to climb a steep hill to my home repeatedly. He was sweating profusely, but finished the job in a timely fashion.  He replaced a section of the pipes outside and they looked brand new at the end.  He removed his shoes before coming inside to sign the paperwork.  He was true pro, and a gentleman as well.  I will use their service again should the occasion arise.< /Review>

Responded quickly, got a quote for fixing a stick shower valve on a Saturday. It was a 3 hour job, so it had to be postponed till Monday, when we had company coming. Finished the job as scheduled. Firm fixed price was reasonable, and the job was done professionally, and was nicely cleaned up.

Highly recommended.< /text>

<review>Two days ago a crew from Colepepper Plumbing Services replaced my main sewer drain from my house to the city connection with a trenchless sewer lining.   I would add that this is the second time  this line had to be replaced in about 6 years. However, this time the work was done by what I believe to be an honest and fair organization. Finding reputable mechanics, electricians , and plumbers has proven to be a challenge for me. For now, I believe I have found an honorable plumbing company in Colepepper Plumbing. Special thanks to Sean, Daniel, Caleb, and Manny!

We had tried to get our "Hansgrohe" shower temperature regulator fixed for over a week with no success. Either the companies we called did not work on that type of system or more than anything never returned our calls. The Colepepper technician (Sean S.) assigned to our call not only knew exactly what we were talking about but knew where it was purchased. Sean came out the same day we called, assessed the issue, ordered the parts and came back first thing the next morning and fixed it. Boom!!! Good to go. We will definitely call Colepepper the first time, next time.<//text>

Last week I noticed the control panel states 0 gallons processed and show 0 gal per hour rate.  Apparently nothing is being filtered.  My wife and I have been calling since Saturday (6 days). No one has come to my home to check it.  Without seeing it they apparently know they must consult with Farris water who customized the system.  We did not know anything about the system prior to the recommendation from Colepepper.  It appears that  Colepepper doesn't know anything about it as well.  They said they would email the manual since for some reason the installer didn't have one.  You guessed it,three weeks later they emailed a sales brochure, and an OEM installation manual for the display controller that states on the cover it is for OEM training only and it is not a system operations manual.   And yes it is not even for the display unit they installed.  My phone calls go to an answering service and no one from Colepepper is available and no one seems to be able to call me back.  My next step is to call the BBB and ask that they honor their guarantee of 100% satisfaction or your money back.  NO ONE WILL TALK WITH ME.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Stan from Colepepper came by this morning and augured my master bathroom toilet.  I had struggled with unclogging myself for 2 days.  UGH!  Stan did a great job for me and I absolutely love this company.  I will definitely use them again and I will ask specifically for Stan.</Review>

Once the work started he was quick and proficient and finished everything in a timely matter and went through the system and repairs he did and also gave us some advice how to further improve our water system, all while not trying to up sale, just being informative and courtious. Great job all the way around!< /review>< pics>

Mitch tried everything he could and broke it down when explaining to us in terms we could understand. He also told us what to do and get in order to save some money when called back to finish the job.

Another discount plumber messed a lot up and was not insured and Mitch came to the rescue.

Highly recommend Mitch, he will do what he can to get the job done<//Review>

<username>Glenn Martinez<//username><review>We own a busy restaurant in San Diego and cannot afford to have the water off for very long. Of course the water line decided to break right durning lunch rush hour. We thought we were going to have to shut down the restaurant. Colepepper was able to get a plumber by within 20 minutes. He quickly came in and diagnosed the problem and gave me a price to fix it. I quickly agreed and he had the water back on within 45 minutes. Colepepper to save the day!< /review>< date>

Mitch arrived early, was completely efficient.  Installed a new garbage disposal and replaced leaking pipes.
He was neat and he informed us about this new disposal.  He was pleasant and left the area clean.
I will call Colepeppper for any of our plumbing needs.< /review>

This was my first time using Colepepper Plumbing.  I called them to get a second opinion.  They came out to look at my kitchen sink, diagnosed the problem, and gave me a free estimate.  Earlier in my he week, I had another company work on my plumbing and was NOT happy with the result.  Sean from Colepepper Plumbing did an excellent job clearing the clogged drain.  He didn’t need to use a camera or break through the dry wall as the other company recommended.  I am very satisfied with Sean’s work and highly recommend Colepepper Plumbing to others.< /text>

I called Colepepper Plumbing because my normal plumber I use in San Diego wasn't answering his phone. At first I was a little skeptical for using somebody else, because I have used the same plumber for years now. I'm glad I used these guys. Great service and honest prices.</review>

<Text>My son decided to have a wrestling match in the shower with my other son and they broke of the shower faucet. Water was spewing everywhere. I was able to get the water off to the house until Colepepper could arrive. Thankfully they were able to make it out quickly because I needed to get the water back on to the house so my family can live. We did have to end up replacing the valve. Lesson learned for my boys. Thank you to Colepepper Plumbing and Joshua.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I recently had work done by them upon a recommendation from my handyman.  I was overcharged by at least twice according to my handyman and two other plumbers I contacted to compare prices.  Mitch would not work with me for any refund and BBB does not handle payment issues; thus, this company is able to get away with this.  I would not recommend this company to anyone.<//review>

When I woke up the day after Christmas I found a substantial leak in my back yard. A quick inspection revealed a leak in my sump pump that was beyond my capabilities. I called Cole-Pepper and they had technicians to my property in about 40 minutes. I am flying out of town tomorrow and had errands to run. They ended taking longer than expected and Armando and Mitch had completed repairs and took payment over the phone. When I returned home, everything was perfectly repaired/replaces. They even saved me money by joining the “Club”. I cannot speak highly enough of their service. They have my business as long as I live in San Diego! Thank you for a job well done!<//Review>

<Text>I'm giving Colepepper Services (and especially HVAC Senior Service Technician, Jared Opp) 5 stars! The company is always quick to respond and quick to route a technician to check on the problem. They do the work they say they're going to do at the price they quote, and they do a great job. Punctual and efficient, the techs explain the work in layman's terms and, when finished, leave the area clean. I'm very happy I found Colepepper Services, and I highly recommend that you give them a try for HVAC or for plumbing (I've used them for both). You won't be disappointed.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1522173696240, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review Shari!'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I had a leak in the ceiling of my kitchen. Leo cut into the ceiling and determined that the shower drain was leaking. He gave me couple of options to fix it and I decided that I wanted it done right. It took him all day and he worked the whole way through. He worked really hard and I appreciate his hard work. Yay! My shower is working again< /Review>< pics>

<text>The plumber came quickly to give me a free estimate. He was very nice and polite and explained to me what needed to be done. He told me I needed to replace my kitchen faucet because my hose broke. The estimate, which included a single handle faucet with nickel finish, was more than $850. Needless to say, I smiled and said thank you but I won't call them again. PS: second estimate from a different company came at $320 including a nickel finish faucet with life time warranty. Second opinion saved me $500.Disappointing when people try to take advantage.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1544502096161, 'text': 'Sorry we let you down Antonella'}</Response>< GmapID>

I called Colepepper because my kitchen sink was clogged. I was shocked to learn that they could come out within 1 hour. Normally I have to wait at least a day to get a plumber out from the other plumbing company's in town I have used. By far this has been my experience in San Diego. Kudos to Colepepper!</Review>

Made an appointment that morning and the plumber came out that afternoon to fix my constantly leaking toilet. He noticed that the other plumbing was leaking too and fixed that at the same time. Glad he didn’t have to come back to fix it. I appreciate not having to take any more days off from work</Review>

<Text>We were out of town on vacation and our neighbor called to tell us we have water all over our front yard. (of course this happens when we are on vacation). Since we have never had to use a plumber before, our neighbor recommended us to Colepepper who they had used before for some drain problems. Colepepper came out that day and texted us some pictures and told us what needed to be done.

Although our yard had to be dug up, they did a great job of putting the grass back and cleaning up. I felt confident with them working at my house even though I was out of the state. They sent before and after pictures of the work and notified me when they were all finished.

Later that day we received a call from the office asking us if everything was ok and if we were happy. It was a nice touch.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1544501892245, 'text': 'Thank you Jane'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf64fffffffff:0x1174220906706f3a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The absolute worst.  Tried to charge me $500 for a simple garbage disposal installation.  Total waste of my day.  What a joke.  It takes one hour at the most to install a garbage disposal.  They said we charge by the job, not by the hour.  Total nonsense.  They should be kicked off Angie's List.<//Review>

<Text>Alex arrived at our home April 21st a little earlier than scheduled which was great for us.  He looked at the job to be done, explained what was needed to fix the area, gave us the price and did a very professional job.  He left the area spotless and we couldn't be happier with the work he did.  If we ever need work done by Colepper in the future, we will definitely ask for Alex.< /Text>< pics>

I want to thank Colepeppers Services and a special thank you to Miguel Ramirez who did an outstanding job. He not only helped us with  our bad plumbing pipes. He sat and explained exactly what needed to be done and showed us our pipes threw a camera. He also explained this to my Mother in-law who has dementia and his patience and understanding her ability of memory loss, he was very caring. Miguel Ramirez needs to be recognized for his work ethics, he made sure we knew exactly what was going to be done step by step and answered all of our questions and concerns he made us feel important and most of all like a true friend. Miguel also introduced the workers who also were very pleasant and considerate of my mother in-law. We will definately use Colepepper Services again as well refer them to a friend and especially ask for Miguel Ramirez. Thank you again Colepepper Services 😉</Review>

I would like to thank Leo Duron and his work mate Jose of Colepepper services. I needed immediate help with a leak that was damaging my home. They were prompt with their arrival and took care of the problem with a minimum of time spent. They were professional and showed care for the customer. It's nice to have quality people and service when in need.< /Text>

I called Colepepper Services for an AC problem and Jared came the next day. He called to inform me of his arrival time and was prompt. I explained the situation with the AC and how the warranty company wouldn't work with me. We decided to try a super seal and it is already blowing cold air. I had gotten quotes on the super seal from two other companies, and when Colepepper came in higher, they were willing to price match. I recommend giving them a call.</text>

We had a frightening gas leak. At fist, we smelled gas in the home and were very scared. We called Colepepper and they instructed us to open the windows and evacuate the house until they got there. Once the plumbers showed up, they shut off the gas immediately, and then found where the gas was leaking. A day later the gas leak was fixed and we were able to move back in again. Although I don’t wish to use a plumber very often, if I do need one, I will pick Colepepper Plumbing< /Review>

<review>If you have ever had a clogged sewer line, you know that it is not fun. We had sewage all over our bathroom. Disgusting! Colepepper to the rescue! They cleaned out the drain and referred us to their restoration company who quickly came out and cleaned up all that nasty sewage. They told us that our sewer line was broken and needs to be repaired in the yard. Will be calling back soon to schedule service for that as soon as we recover from the sewage in the house< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>Called with a clogged pipe in main line and Leo came out same day. Gave me options, prices and recommendations then went ahead and snaked the pipe around 80 feet. Had 2 or 3 clogs but got it to push thru. Showed me where the outside valves were and told me what to tell the plumber if it happened again. I would highly recommend them being it was done quickly, very professional, friendly and for less than everyone else. I called 5 places and got 3 prices slightly higher with most saying they couldn't come out today and one that called me back 4 hrs later. Thanks again Leo I'll def give you a call for plumbing issues moving forward.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Text>ColePepper came quickly to deal with a leaking, dripping hose and spray gun on the hose reel installed at the front of my house. I was concerned because I could not turn the water off with the hose bib. To my surprise, Mitch and his son Tyler showed me that I had the faucet on full force instead of off. Dah! They did say the faucet was stiff but still OK. I appreciated Mitch's gesture of "no charge."
Had Mitch quote me installation of a circulating pump onto my water heater so I would have hot water on demand to my showers. Gave me a great deal! I was unsure whether to proceed right away so I'm putting it off.< /Text>< resp>

BEWARE!!
Mitchell Kenney, the owner of Colepepper Plumbing appears to be licensed.  He promised us services that were to be performed by a crew of five, with on-site supervision of a California licensed plumber, requiring 6 days to complete.  Instead, he sent an unlicensed individual who spoke no English, & alleged that he had completed the task in 9 hours.  Later, Mitch sent his foreman,
who is apparently licensed in another state, who said, "I didn't think he could do it by himself."  We were completely misled about the scope of this work, & must now hire another plumber to evaluate what has been done. So far, we have been charged over $700 per hour for the services of an unlicensed, non-English speaking laborer.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
WE WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY!!<//review>

<Text>Armando and his team were very professional and friendly. They cleared a stoppage from the  bathroom and installed a "double put sweep clean out" 6ft deep in my front yard. They had to dig out a few bushes and reinstalled the bushes. It took them a day and a half and the total cost was around $4700.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1522173383091, 'text': 'This was a big job. Thanks for using us!'}</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Absolute scam. I need our kitchen sink snaked on a saturday and he quoted me $1600 to snake the line and replace the pipes under the sink. That was the cheap price. The other option was more, and he was going to use illegal plastic pipe to do the job. STAY AWAY< /review>< Rating>

< Review>
Do NOT use this plumber. I needed a replacement thermocouple for my water heater, and my technician, Sean S, came out and said it would cost 700 dollars for him to replace it. I looked online, and a thermocouple for my model of water heater costs 20 dollars...That's a 680 dollar profit! He also gave me a lot of misinformation about how the thermocouple was attached to the door seal and it all needed to be replaced, which was the reason for the high cost. Later, I found this was not the case when another plumber came and replaced the thermocouple by itself. I hate it when people try to take advantage of me like this. It's really messed up. If you are looking for a plumber, go with John Padilla Plumbing instead. They gave me a much better rate that saved me 550 dollars.<//Review>

I had what appeared to be a leak from my hot water heater in my condo this past weekend.  I called another plumbing company Saturday and got scammed.  They replaced supply lines at a cost of $225.00 confident the issue was resolved.  It was not.  The owner came out the following day perplexed and very unsure of himself stating to accurately diagnose he had to tear down my walls to expose all the pipes to determine it.  This left me uneasy and skeptical.  I told him I needed the night to sleep on it.  Monday morning decided best to get a second opinion from a company with greater expertise at detecting leaks.  I called Colepepper Plumbing explaining my situation.  They offered to come out and give me a free estimate and within an hour Joshua arrived.  He immediately sensed my hesitation due to my previous experience and very quickly gained my trust by taking extra time confidently, kindly explaining in detail what needed to be done along with the cost (which did not involve tearing down my walls!).  In less than 1 hour he found the problem which had nothing to do with my condo at all !!  The neighbor's hot water heater had burst leaking into the exterior and interior of my unit causing fairly extensive damage.  He also took pictures and wrote a detailed receipt for my documentation in moving forward to gain reimbursement.  Then took it a step further to advise me of how to get my money back from the past plumber.  Using his words would you know I received a full refund in 45 minutes !!  I am in the customer service industry myself and Colepepper  Plumbing is at the top in this department.  I would refer them to anyone and everyone.  They will be the sole company I will go to for all my future plumbing needs.  They may be a bit more pricey but you get what you pay for !!  This is a smaller company that is efficient, courteous, clean, believe you matter and truly care about who you are.  Thank You Joshua & Mitch for everything !!</text>

Called Colepepper after seeing a Google Ad... We accidently drilled through a wall into a copper water line. Mitch answered the phone immediately, asked what we needed help with. After I explained the situation he said he would have someone to us in Leucadia within the hour. Less than an hour later Mitch was at the door. He said he didn't have anyone who could get to us sooner, so he got in a truck in rush hour traffic and made it to our location in less than an hour. He quickly assessed the problem, told us what would be required, and gave us a price. The work was completed quickly (less than 2 hours), Mitch was great to deal with- professional, courteous, and friendly- and I would HIGHLY recommend using them.<//Review>

Absolute worst company ever.  Most of the reviews posted are fake.  Very unreliable, over priced, no integrity.  The owner has severe anger management issues.  Make sure you review the YELP reviews.  Totally the worst plumbing company in existence.</Text>

Honest plumber.  On-time and fairly priced.  We are from Las Vegas, and have a second home in the Del Mar area. Our water heater TP valve was leaking hot water, when we arrived for our summer stay the valve was malfunctioning and leaking hot water.  He came on a Saturday as promised.  Highly recommend.<//Text>

Mitch and his people came through immediately when other companies had totally dropped the ball.  I had a homeowners' policy with First American (terrible company) and they contracted with A-Z Appliances which is greatly undermanned in the call center.  My gas line leaked on our dryer and SDG&E had to come out to shut it off or the home would have gone up in flames.  I immediately filed with First American and they gave me the contractor to take care of it. They scheduled on a Friday.  No show.  Then I was assured they'd be there on Saturday.  Again, no show.  Then A-Z promised they'd be there on Monday. You guessed it: no show.  After waiting 20 minutes on hold I finally got through to the only one in the call center - Adam - who is overworked and a very nice man - but management does not communicate with him.  He said he'd talk to the manager (whoever that is) and get back to me.  He called me back and said since the dryer is okay First American would not cover a new flex gasline and duct for the dryer.  I had seen an ad in the San Diego Union-Tribune and called and Mitch, the owner, answered and was terrific.  Even though he said he was booked, he was able to send two very nice and capable men in Leo Duron and Tyler and they fixed it that day and the price was very reasonable.  I can't emphasize the professionalism and thoroughness enough.  I strongly recommend if you need a plumber or for anything electrical or gas wise, you will be greatly satisfied with Colepepper Plumbing.  My wife and I give them 5 enthusiastic stars.</Review>

I normally use a different plumber but he wasn’t available because it was the weekend. I called Colepepper and they told me they could get me on the schedule that day. 2 hours later the problem is fixed and I’m back to normal< /text>

<Text>This place is horrible!!!! They charged my mom four times the amount she should have been charged to fix her a/c unit. Then the man who came out to fix her a/c didn't  put everything back together (never connected her condensation hose it seems) and it continued to leak and now her ceiling in her bathroom has completely caved in. These people are a bunch of jokes and frauds and all they can tell you is we will get back to you in 72 hours when you contact their customer service. DO NOT USE THEM without first getting a second and third price quote because YOU WILL BE OVERCHARGED and the work will be shady.</Text>< Pics>

One of our customers clogged our urinal and didn’t tell us. It ended up flooding the men’s bathroom. Colepepper came out and unclogged it through all that mess and got us working again. Sorry you had to deal with that!<//Text>

Unfortunately, my clog was farther than his snaking tool could reach.  The company called me and quoted $3000 to fix it!  I called one of their competitors who came and they were able to snake it for $120.  Couldn't help but feel like Colepepper was trying to rip me off after seeing the other guy come fix it with his better equipment.</Review>< user>

There were just lots of different people that you had involved talking with us and it was hard to get proper communication to everyone.
