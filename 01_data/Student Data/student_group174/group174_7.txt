I really want to love this place but I can't. Time and again the customer service experience leaves a lot to be desired. Today I ordered by way of
Postmates using Google Maps. Order was marked ready within 12 minutes. Arrived 20 minutes later to learn they were out of items I ordered and so they requested I order something else.  So I did. Waited another 20 minutes, got my take out and left. When I got home and saw how small the $18 entree was disappointment ensued. The food, yes, is delicious however the prices are ridiculous - even for LA.

This is probably my 10th visit to Camp Pho. I was a frequent and forgiving customer in their opening days. Regretfully 3 years later I can't say much has changed as in the way of customer experience. The staff are really nice yet somehow a systematic approach to having a quality restaurant experience doesnt seem to work here.< /review>

Complete rip-off. We ordered from Postmates and the poor driver had to wait for 50 minutes until the order was ready (it's pre-made broth and then you toss some ingredients in a bowl, how can that take so long?). After our food arrived over an hour late and cold, we were in shock to see that a Pho bowl of $18 was a mini size. We ordered two large ones and both of them were tiny. The broth wasn't even enough to cover the noodles. I order pho a lot and will never choose Camp again - you get triple the size for half the price elsewhere. The taste was great but what good does it do when you're still hungry after an order over $40.< /Text>

Disappointed by this place. The service was slow and disorganized, some items are overpriced (bok choy & mushroom small portion is $12... and not worth it), there are very few tables eventhough there is lots of outdoor space, and they've been there over 1 year and still haven't managed to put a sign up with their name. Spring rolls are pretty good, especially the mushroom ones.< /review>

2 Words: All Hype.

Camp Pho started off as an In-Tents(ha!) food adventure and quickly turned out to be a wet Tee-pee.

Now, I will say these good things first. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and they have a menu that has a host of variety and tastiness. It was a good start.  The waiter was funny and the hostess was prompt. Restaurants, however should be graded on the food and service, which is more like 90% of how I look at dining. It doesn't matter to me if your restaurant is a run-down shack, but if your food is on point, trust me, you'll win my praise.

My party arrived during non-peak hours and was quickly seated. We were all ready to enjoy some delicious fusion. We ordered, enjoyed some funny puns from our waiter, and he told us, twenty minutes--fine that's typical. We listened to reggae, odd choice for a hip-restaurant. Why have it on blast and on repeat? Something wasn't quite right with the ambiance.

Half an hour in: It was noticeable that the wait staff began to ignore us. One of my friends had his hand in the air for five minutes, trying to ask where the food was.

One hour later, our first bowl of pho hits the table. It's cold. The Butcher's Bowl is sparse--for being called the Butcher there seemed to be a lack of meat. I don't suppose the Butcher had to run out and catch it himself. Anyway, the flavor of the pho was different--probably would have tasted amazing had it been served fresh rather than left out to cool, or microwave--whichever the case. As it was, cold, made it a disappointment.

The crab eggrolls came out at the 1:20 mark. Burnt. Black. extra chewy. Ate it anyway, because: hangry.

The check came. My friend put down his credit card, and not a moment later was the card picked up. Service goes fast when you're taking payment from a customer.

Wait staff had the nerve to come back and say, "thanks for coming! sorry about your experience, please come back and I hope it'll turn out better!" All the while offering no way to make peace or win back our patronage.

Don't believe the hype. Overpriced. Bad service. Forgettable food. Check out some of the authentic pho places in Torrance or even one of the smaller ma & pop shops on Culver blvd.</review>

The food is great. HOWEVER....
- Placed order at 5:00, told would be ready at 5:30. When I went to pick up I had to wait an additional 35 MINUTES......
-LA is a CoVid hotspot- but they made about twelve of us wait inside the small restaurant for our orders. There is only two people working behind the counter, so no way of knowing your order is ready unless you are right there. (LA doesn’t allow you to eat inside, but CAMP thinks it ok to let you hang out while waiting for food)
- They also have some cool toys , I guess to play with while you wait for your food. But there is no one wiping them down, so not very well thought out
TIP to management- just get buzzers and let people wait in their cars so you don’t put us at risk. Thank You.<//Text>

SERVICE was efficient. Came here on a weekday at around 6:30 and was seated in about 5 minutes. I was surprised we didn't have to wait for seating and was v happy about this. It was windy outside, and I was definitely in the mood for oodles of warm soupy noodles.</text>

You walk in and the place doesn't even look like a restaurant; all I see are children's toys and disheveled employees, so the welcome and entrance isn't very welcoming. The meat is spot-on (we tried filet mignon and chicken) and the teas are delicious. However, the bowls are part of the pho experience- they are too deep/narrow here and need to be shallow and wider with MORE broth to allow the vegetables and meat to cook. They give you so many delicious vegetables, but not enough room in the bowl or broth to enjoy them. The broth was also on the sweet side, I couldn't place it but there was a spice that shouldn't be in it. Normally I enjoy sipping the broth after, but I didn't enjoy it. Finally, the hand-written menus on laminated cardboard are unimpressive, especially after the unimpressive welcome. This place could be amazing if just a few things were different!</review>< pics>

I love sitting on the high chairs at the bar and cha chatting with the staff, who are always super friendly and helpful.

Pho is great - the broth is so flavorful and they always add a huge bunch of fresh herbs and sprouts! Regular size is more than enough in most cases :) It's pretty big!

Also works great for take out!<//Review><user_id>104186190923279706733<//user_id></record>

<text>When this place fails as a Pho restaurant, at least they’ll be able to take their tiny pieces of Ribeye and turn it into a Philly Cheesesteak shop fairly easily.

Broth felt oily.
definitely overpriced for the portion sizes (I devoured my regular and most of my dissatisfied fiancés)
first time I’ve ever had the meat fully cooked before it entered the broth.

Blossom is way better.<//text>< pics>

<review>Camp Pho is pho-nomenal ... had my fair share in cities all over. Camp Pho broth is hands down the best I’ve ever had. Beyond excited to have this awesome, well run pho joint in the neighborhood. Thank you Camp Pho!

We both got the Butchers Bowls and split the mushroom spring rolls.... 10/10 would recommend. Traditional pho & some other menu items with modern twists. The hibiscus tea was also nice.< /review>< Pics>

<text>The food was good. Price was alright for the size, even tho it seemed a little bit expensive. The big problem we had, was that we had to wait almost 40 minutes for our food, which was really annoying. It was ok overall, but the wait times were too long.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmNb2wSekeyI9X9y6XWiMWWyfezyBodeCL1KBX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMijOXjHC3xRhHRu78G5gPZ72wLSRpxkzeAQ7bP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6vDzt_bVE-DQRkj2-83DRO1gq1e8vZ8FBXep1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7I8Yoj-QEvYkpqjf6w7Si0m4k_VVw3iwBF0Q4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

This place rocks... the food is tasty for sure.  The options remind me of Vietnamese food stalls, meaning very simple but really good plates.

The pho broth and noodles were really good.

Despite being in a corner strip mall, the atmosphere inside was really well done and had a unique quality to it.

This place is food for a meet up with 4 people or less as well as a good date spot.  There is a good place next door to get a drink / beer after dinner.< /text>

<review>I quite liked Tín! The service was quick (if a bit brusque, but it was lunchtime and they were slammed with people so I didn't mind), and I got my takeaway box after waiting only for 15 minutes. I got the bun tom - grilled shrimp over vermicelli, which is my usual order at Vietnamese restaurants, and I must say I was not disappointed. The shrimp were perfectly cleaned and sautéed, and the vermicelli was tender. Overall a good experience at my first CA Vietnamese restaurant!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that kitchen staffs were white... We ordered butchered pho and crab egg rolls. Just like what previous reviewers had mentioned, food wasn't authentic at all. The food not being authentic doesn't mean less tasty but this place was an exception. Pho was too salty, the meat was poor quality and the egg rolls contained mochi type of filling inside which made it too chewy.

The place was empty when we got there but there was no one to greet or tell us where to sit so we just picked a table and waited for a waiter. But no one came so I went and grabbed menus myself. A waiter with a flower over his ear finally showed up and sat next to us, which I thought it was odd, and took our order. I told him butchered pho but no meat balls. He said, "ok no meat balls, got it." And then the pho came with meat balls. 🤔 I didn't say anything because mistakes do happen...

But what bothered me the most was that we were done with our food and waiting for the waiter to bring us our bill but he was busy flirting with a female customer. He started off with a casual conversation and then he eventually sat down at her table. He started talking about where he grew up and what he liked to do for fun and etc... This went on for 10+ minutes. It was too obvious he was flirting and wanted to ask her out, and I was like just ask for her number already. While this was going on, another customer couldn't wait for his bill so he walked to the bar to pay for his food, so I did the same.

Maybe I would have given this restaurant another star for this review for entertainment if he had asked her out or at least asked her for her number but he didn't.<//text>< time>

Hip place with a good selection of Pho and Asian dishes with freshly made ingredients. We had the crab meat rice and the garden of Eden Pho bowl. So tasty! The staff were friendly and they played some great tunes. Would recommend!</Review>

Great flavor but very skimpy portions.I paid $16+ for a large and the bowl was 60 % filled. They should at least be smart and double the noodles and add broth near the top. Killer flavor but I felt scammed.<//Text>

<review>That time when you have a spontaneous idea to go try a new restaurant on Abbot Kenny and are told it’s a 45 minute wait.

So you hop in the truck and roll down to Lincoln Blvd and try that “new little pho spot “.

The music was bumping. The vibes chill and cool, space: open, airy and welcoming.

The people were helpful and pleasant. Brandon our waiter was super awesome. Camp Pho: where simplicity and quality meet good food and humble folks.

The crab rolls were Delicious! We are giving Camp Pho 5 stars! Ten Pho! Over and Out!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>Fantastic food, abysmal service. This is my fourth visit and I keep hoping they'll pull it together, but it's almost like they just want to be a takeout spot. It really is great, I haven't had a bad dish, but it's clearly a madhouse and food comes out late and disjointed - one dish took 30 min, the other took 45 (luckily we shared). The byob part is nice, this is the first time we've taken advantage of it, but the price they quoted me when I asked was 300% different from the price that appeared on my bill (which was the wrong bill first, I might add).

If you are craving pho, this place has great food. Just don't expect it to be fast or smooth.<//review>< Pictures>

Our orders were wrong. My +1 and I ordered the exact same thing and ours tasted completely different, like there was some sort of cinnamon or something in my broth. And when my server was taking ages to come back to give us a part of our order that was missed, I overheard at the bar that other people were getting their orders wrong. Maybe it was a bad night but wow I don’t plan on coming back!</Text>

Really amazing experience. You can immediately tell how much the staff cares for the menu and the customers experience. It seems like they put their all into their food. The broth was amazing and the appetizers were to die for. Some of the best pho I’ve ever had!< /text>

Not the best Pho I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  Menu needs some work - layout is plain and thrown together.  Staff was good and attentive immediately.  Prices are a bit steep.  Even traditional pho places aren't this expensive.</text>

I couldnt taste anything else.
Service was fantastic and the waiters are nice, the place is nice, all was great except all I tasted for that entire hour I was there was cloves. The meat tasted like cloves. The broth tasted like cloves. The veggies tasted like cloves.
Not bad. But not great either.
If you like cloves, you'll LOVE this spot.</Text>< time>

Love Camp Pho, so happy to have a local Pho place to go to in Venice! I keep bringing friends and family here. You can’t go wrong with the spring rolls (hen of woods and crab are my favorite). As far as pho their Vegan is awesome and I usually do the Butcher (without the tripe). The broths are super tasty and portions are big, and service is really friendly. I highly recommend it!</review>

Nice place ,  food taste good however every time I come here the doors are wide open and it feels cold inside. The bowls are have full and everytime I have to ask for extra broth. The pho soup should be like a soup not like a bowl of noodles.. the same complaints everytime I come in and they still have not fixed things!!! Who manages this place???</text>

<text>BEST PHO EVER! They cook their broth for 24 hours to get the perfect taste. The ingredients are so good. They def don’t use any msg and the couple that runs it is soo lovely. I wish every restaurant was like them. Sometimes the food can take a tad to be ready, but it is worth it!<//text>< Pictures>

<review>The food is great, especially the brisket rolls and ceviche, but OMG please turn up the lights a bit and turn down the music a lot. The dark interior lighting just lets the ugly fluorescent lighting from the street flood the interior instead.</review>< user_id>

Not my cup of tea. I asked for it with no onions...got onions all over it. I didn't think the broth tasted all that great - it was way too earthy for me. But others that like a new type of pho may like this place.</Review>

This wasn't.

But it was definitely a place that underperformed vs. what it could have been. Bok choy and mushrooms were superb, the "bone broth" pho was not so interesting or tasty. It wasn't bad per se, but it wasn't very good either.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Growing up Asian, I had better pho before. The noodles were hard and the broth was cold. The broth should be hot to soften the pho. The meat was too thick. They didn’t have fish sauce or chili oil as their seasoning. The crab egg rolls were burn too. They should’ve just fried it until it’s golden brown, not dark brown. Ignore this place, I had to wait almost and hour for my food.< /Text>

<review>Waited 45 minutes and was then told they forgot my order and it would be another 20 minutes to make the food. Was never even brought water and every staff member was rude and has no idea what they were doing. Multiple tables walked out when we were there. Highly recommend not eating here</review>< Time>

This is my 5th visit and I'm finally posting because I don't want this place to go anywhere.  This place is a true gem hidden within a nondescript plaza (and without signage) so I've missed the entrance twice.  In my life, I've eaten countless homemade pho, cooked pho myself, and frequented hundreds of pho restaurants.  This place is legitimate.  While Santa Monica and West LA is generally a desert for quality pho, Camp Pho stands out and ranks among the best pho restaurants I've had.  Pho purists may complain about the price (~$12 for a small pho bowl) but it's Venice so priced accordingly to the local market.  For for timers, I recommend the large butcher pho bowl with a side of Hanoi crab egg rolls and a Thai iced tea.<//review>

<text>Best Pho I have ever had in my life. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are and how AMAZING the broth tastes! My favorite is the Brisket Pho and they use REAL, TENDER, JUICY BRISKET.

Other Pho restuarants just use thinly sliced meat regardless of what kind of meat you get, it all looks the same and taste the same.......NOT AT CAMP PHO. CAMP PHO IS THE SPOT TO BE.</text></record>

We came in when the shop was not crowded but it still took them more than 20 mins to serve us food. For a pho shop it took just 5-10 mins to serve.

As a Vietnamese I cant accept shrimp pho or basa fish pho, not to mention the combo pho that has beef, shrimp and basa fish altogether. Beef pho was not good. Beef is not of the best quality and they had stewed beef, which again doesnt go with pho. The broth was bad. The waitress told us they cooked each bowl separately - this is not the way pho is cooked.

Overall I had bad experience here< /text>

This place is prettt great! Broth is delicious and they dont skimp out on any ingredients. Its all there and always satisfying. Definietly great for those with a cold!
Try the BRISKET. I find it to be one of the most delicious.
Also, a SMALL size is just enough for those who aren't very hungry.</Review>

<Review>Had the large butcher pho.  Broth is very thick and brown. Was not to bad but very salty could use less salt and leave it up to the consumer to add fish sauce or salt.  It was weird again to see white people making pho for asians.  If it wasn't so salty I would give it 4 stars.  The meat and meatballs was very good, pho noodles ok but didn't get much in the large.  I would not eat there again due to the salty flavor.<//Review>< pics>

<Date>1547166620842< /Date><rating>2<//rating><text>BYOC- Bring your own chopsticks.

I wanted to try Camp Pho as it was a new spot that opened up a few months ago.  I have walked by a few times and am always open to tasting new places.

The place was PACKED at 830pm. I checked over the menu and spotted some new things I wanted to try, looked at the reviews and they seemed good.

The service was slow and the night started to feel like the place has a few kinks to work out.  The table that we were sat at was not clean. there were several small dishes on the table, also not clean.  I noticed a few other things and decided to stop looking because this kind of thing starts to put me off about a place.  Dirty front of house generally means dirty back of house....Not a good first impression to say the least.

I asked the server for some suggestions from the menu and she said everything is good. Ok...

When it came time to order, the first two appetizers we ordered were sold out. So we didnt order another. The server made the suggestion to order the brisket Pho and when my gf ordered it the server back pedaled and said they were out of that as well.

Brisket is a tougher, less expensive cut from the others on the menu (filet mignon, ribeye), its also a pretty popular cut of meat for Pho so kinda surprised they were out but again the service is slow so might have helped if we knew that off the bat, probably something the staff should tell people when they hand them menus but Ok...  So the GF ordered a  Regular filet mignon Pho bowl and I ordered the large mixed meat  Pho bowl (Brisket which they were out of , Filet, ribeye and meatball) because, being it was our first time, I wanted to see the difference and taste several meats. I also opted out of having the Tripe.

The server boasted that the Pho was cooked 30 hours or something to that effect but it took a LONG TIME (which felt like 30hours) to get our food, or even the drinks that we ordered.

BIG PHO-BLEMO is that Meat quality here was sub par.  The meat balls have large, hard, rubbery pieces of gristle in them.  In fact, the meatball is a bit rubbery as well, the first bite was like chewing on a dog toy so I picked out "meatball" and placed it on the stack of dirty dishes that were still on our table when we arrived.  For a dish that has several meat cuts highlighted I couldn't distinguish between them.  Aside from the meat ball a filet should be distinguishable from a ribeye and they just tasted bland, not seasoned, over cooked and VERY dry.  How meat can be that dry sitting in a bowl of Pho is beyond me.

The reason that I say to bring your own chopsticks is that they use very cheaply made plastic chopsticks which are not conducive to gripping the noodles to eat them neatly, your noodles will most certainly slip and splosh unless you can slurp them up fast.

The broth was good, the side of sprouts, mint, jalapeno and lime were standard but they sat under the bowl of pho.
The soup did stay warm the entire meal which is a testament to the bowl quality, I just wish that they took time to select better meat to go with the nice bowl. The meat quality was truly a major disappointment.
There are a lot of really great reviews on here about this place. It is cool that there is another soup spot on the westside, the broth is nice and the people there seem nice as well, its just a shame that the place wasnt run a bit better last night and that the meat quality was poor.
The place has potential and is in a great location.  I would only recommend that the place be kept a bit cleaner, the staff would communicate a bit more about what they were serving and a "your food will be out soon" and that maybe the chef could provide a better quality of meat.  I dont mind paying a bit more for better quality but when I order the dish and the meat is that bad, it would turn people off from giving it another shot.  That said, theres a lot of very positive reviews, mine is only one couples experience on one night.<//text>< Pictures>

Went last night which was a Friday & had a great time. Me and my boyfriend were here from NY and wanted a place to have a few drinks. The place had great music and compared to NY the drink prices were nothing. All the bartenders were great & attentive. When we told them we were visitors they offered us a free shot.</review>

<Review>For such a long time my boyfriend and I have been looking for a really good sushi place close to where we live and we're so glad we found Kazuki Sushi. The food is soooo bomb, you can just tell it was made with love. Everything from the sushi itself to the miso soup and garlic edamame. #fire we got the dragon roll, paradise roll and 101 roll.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Who doesn't love a good pool with a view. If you're into this type of ambiance you know that the cocktails are going to be overpriced, but you live with it because everything is very cute. This is a fun place to come and enjoy a drink with friends or even a date. You can sit by the pool, at a little table, alongside the lounge area or you can stand by the bar. The space does offer good views and attracts an upbeat crowd. Expect to see hotel guests, tourists, and other travelers mixed in with a few locals at this trendy poolside lounge.< /Review>

My friend and I stumbled upon here looking for a chill and quiet lounge to chat in. When we first arrived the venue was pretty empty, not an hour in the music started popping, crowds started to rush in and by approx. midnight, this bar had turned into a club! Lololz

So to be honest, I can't comment on how this bar is on a regular basis, but as far as for the night we visited, it was fun!</Review>< pics>

<review>We popped into The Little Easy for happy hour while in DTLA and loved it. It has a charming, cozy, and intimate vibe. The bartender was very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in. Although he was the only person tending the bar as well as taking food and drink orders, he managed to take great care of everyone who walked in and did not seem stressed out about it. Their happy hour is great and includes cocktails, wine, and even food. I'll definitely be back for happy hour and hope to try the restaurant section in the back which was closed until after happy hour.</review><name>Beverly Santiago< /name><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

I absolutely love this place! They are right around the corner from me and I could probably eat here everyday. Both the food and drinks are so delicious! I usually get the garlic bread grilled cheese with tomato soup. Every time it hits the spot! And I don't know why I crave their tortilla chips and guac everyday! It's a problem really lol. This is definitely a great spot. Would recommend time and time again!!<//review>

We love them again!  Dined here for the first time in over a year and we definitely enjoyed our meal this time around.  The servers were attentive and catered to our requests, we got everything we asked for.  The restaurant has definitely gotten very popular, it was packed on a Tuesday night.  Prices are now almost at Fogo de Chao levels but well worth it!</Text>

A great local dive bar with a chill atmosphere.  There are darts, pool tables, and a juke box - what more can you ask for?!  The staff here is pretty chill and friendly.  They have a decent selection of beer on tap as well as daily drink specials.  The prices are pretty reasonable.
There's also a few TVs if you want to catch a game or two.  As for parking, you should be able to find spots on the streets and a small lot next to the bar.  They don't have food here, but you're able to bring outside food in.</review>

Almost everything was pretty good just that it wasn't clear which side was which cause when you walk in you see two bars (one on the left and one on the right, it's to the right, left is another also good drinks but you can't take them to the pool-got a drink there first cause the confusion).<//review>

<Review>Well sorta. We hit The Frolic after visiting Buk's bungalow over on De Longpre Ave where there is now an official Cultural Heritage Board Monument sign with the header: "Bukowski Court." Very impressive, and thanks to the people that fought for not only the designation but to forever preserve the bungalow its-self.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c6355e868bf5:0xa7ddbf5cf2858d3f< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Went once and wouldn't return. Service was bad, drinks were watered down, food was cold. Tots were okay. I found it bizarre that they are a full service bar yet they don't have a blender?? Not kidding, no blender.

I'll stick to going to The Yard House.</Text></record>

Theres was no toilet paper, toilet seat covers, or paper towels in the mens bathroom. I told two different guy staff members and they just laughed. Its been 2 hours and it's still not refilled. So unsanitary for some place that requires guest list and some $$. The sparklers were cool for my friends bday tho i guess.<//text>

Oh Daisy!!  Lol!

I read the review before I came in tonight...  Expectations weren't that high, but I was hoping for friendly and sorta quiet. I got friendly (Daisy), football (Yay Chili), and "sorta" quiet!

The whiskey selection was nice, clientele was nice, and Daisy is even nicer. Lots more here to check out in the future, but there will be a future!

Considering I have to decide to be in this area I guess it is a great rating when I will come back to the area just to come back to this bar!</text>

This place is owned by the people who own WISH in SOMA, and I love that place so I thought I would check it out after sushi. It's BEAUTIFUL! And like Wish the bar staff is friendly and make great drinks. I had a spicy drink and it had the perfect amount of warmth. The place is just a cool place to hang out and have a drink with a friend and not get overwhelmed with overly loud music and douchebags.< /Review>

Great to see a new bar in the neighborhood as the bar that was there before was a dump!   Stumbled in here on Saturday night and had a couple beers, which they had a good selection.  My friend had the negroni cocktail which she loved.   Since its brand new they still need a bit more furniture which I'm sure they'll fix, but they had some cool video art on the back wall.</review>

<Text>If there was a mixologist's version of a master sushi chef's omakase, I had it at The Rendition Room. And the master mixologist behind the bar goes by the name of Scott.

Rather than go into full detail, I highly recommend that you read the other reviews and visit this place to experience it for yourself.

I had three drinks. I would have had more, but they close at 10pm. Started off with an Old Fashioned, asked for a good follow-up to that (Four On The Floor), and a final drink to cap off this wonderful cocktail trilogy (Mr. Warmth).<//Text><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c6355e868bf5:0xa7ddbf5cf2858d3f< /gmapID><date>1581411657457<//date>< Pictures>

< Review>
My friend and I go here often to pass time while our kids are in classes. We love it. The bartenders are always nice and remembered us after the very first time we walked in. It's quite tropic inside and they're specialty drinks make you feel like you're in Hawaii. The mojito is amazing with coconut and mint. They are not heavy in the alcohol but the pina coladas are pre mixed and that seems to be the strongest drink. They have an outside patio for smokers or people that want to feel the air while they're drinking. Seems like a lot of "studio" people hang out there after work. Happy hour ends at 7 so make sure you get there before then. We've come in close to seven and purchased 2 drinks and they held it the second one for us at the Happy hour price. I highly recommend this place. Parking is only street parking but I've never had any issue finding a spot.<//Review>

THIS PLACE IS NOW ONE OF FAVORITE BARS IN DOWNTOWN. THE VIBE IS SO CHILL THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE IN THERE & ALL OF THE DRINKS WERE INEXPENSIVE. WE DIDN’T ORDER ANY FOOD SINCE WE WERE GOING OUT TO DINNER BUT THE FOOD LOOKED AND SMELLED SO GOOD! THE PLACE WASN’T SO PACKED AT THE TIME WE WERE THERE BUT I GUESS IT WAS STILL TOO EARLY FOR A SATURDAY NIGHT. THE LIVE MUSIC WAS AWESOME. WE WERE ALL HAVING A GREAT TIME ENJOYING THE LIVE JAZZ. THE BARTENDER THAT WAS ATTENDING OUR SMALL GROUP WAS SO FRIENDLY AND VERY ATTENTIVE. I CAN’T BELIEVE I HAD NEVER BEEN TO THIS PLACE BEFORE. I HAD ALWAYS HEARD OF IT FROM MY FRIENDS PARTYING THERE ON THE WEEKENDS. I’M REALLY GLAD I MADE IT OUT THAT NIGHT AND FOUND A NEW PLACE AROUND ME THAT I ENJOYED HANGING OUT AT.

<Review>The crowd was ghetto, the bar was way too overcrowded and the body heat was unbearable. I almost had a panic attack. I couldn't move or breathe in there on a Saturday night. There was no AC. They need to limit the amount of people they let in so people can be there comfortably.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

I moved to DC from LA about 7 years ago and recently went back and celebrated my birthday with a few close friends.  It's amazing how things change in 7 years-for the better!  I was researching places and I found The Falls.  I was able to make reservations for a booth to accommodate my party and didn't have to pay for bottle service which is awesome.  I made reservations and the next day they responded.  Overall it was a great night.  Service was great.<//Text>

Great little bar in downtown LA, I went on a Saturday and it was a pleasant crowd, mostly 30s & 40s in age. Fun but not rowdy and wild, drinks are reasonably priced and they do serve up some specialty cocktails, beer selection was a bit limited in my opinion, but this is more of a cocktail bar. would definitely visit again.< /Text>

This new funky vibe lounge, in the heart of Downtown LA, is super cool place.  The latest music mixed in with some hip hop is just what you need coming off a hard days of work. Go check it out if you are in the mood for a wide variety of music while sipping on a nice cocktail after hours.< /Text>

<Text>Came here on a Friday night and was turned off by how rude the bartenders are. We waited patiently at the bar for a while, and it seems that the bartenders were only keen in attending to customers who are more dressed up. Heck, I was at the bar counter for 10 minutes waiting patiently for the bartender to finish making his drink for the guy sitting next to me. Yet, when he's done, he skipped over me (like I'm invisible) and talked to another customer who literally just walked up to the counter right after he made that drink. That is rude and unprofessional.

We left. I don't want to tip any bartender who does not know how to treat his customers right. It's a shame really. Because we would have tipped well and have gotten more drinks too.

With an attitude like that, I'll never be back. You've been warned.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2c6355e868bf5:0xa7ddbf5cf2858d3f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I like this bar, dark and usually not too busy. It's a cool 70s glam rustic cabin kind of situation. Service is pretty good for dtla, I like the artichoke dip and they have decent flat bread pizzas.< /review>

<text>Small, and intimate...that's how I like my bars.  It is a great place for in-between places.  The HH is great...you can't go bad with $6 artisan cocktails and or $5 beer specials (beer + shot).

Also, a place can't go wrong when the door person is reading 50 Shades of Gray.</text>< Pics>

WARNING!!
They offer a TERRIBLE jam night for musicians
1.Hosted by Matthew Yeakley, who was very unfriendly and unclear if they are open to jazz standards or open jams.
2. Didn't have any sort of list system for musicians, he would only approach people he knew and ask them to play.
3. Extremely arrogant attitude.
So pls all musicians who want to have fun and actually jam, support other jam nights, this one is not worth your time. Avoid this one like the plague!!< /Review>

< review>
Los Angeles has so many beautiful and iconic bars and lounges throughout its wonderful borders. No matter what your tastes are there is at least a dozen or so watering holes to wet your thirst and fit your vibe. Unfortunately, The Falls isn't one of them.

Located in the heart of downtown L.A. this place was absolutely a cluster of mismatched ideas and wrong thoughts. The moist poignant of them would have to be the set the DJ played for where not only my party but the crowd around me were commenting on the awfulness of the music selection. It would switch from music you would hear from Mornings Become Eclectic (but the nightmare version) to a club banger to industrial music with no beat or bearing. It was so jarring that even with the drinks (and they do make good ones) be drank it was hard to enjoy the atmosphere, which is a damn shame because the deco is modern, although a bit mismatched with art deco and lumberjack designs placed side-by-side as well. Many would consider this to be a bar that matches the taste of the movement of Los Angeles these days but experiencing it myself I couldn't help but feel like it was utter crap.

Perhaps it was an off night, and I really want that to be the reason, because the reviews here are so high and some of my fellow Yelpers I follow love this place. So if I do return here I hope I never come back with the same DJ again.

The Breakdown

Pros
- creative drinks
- interesting architecture
- great location in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles
- lenient dress code

Cons
- awful, AWFUL music that can ruin an entire night and make you say, "I. Literally. Can't. Even."< /review>

<username>Esther Kim<//username><date>1446965460975<//date><Rating>3</Rating><text>A couple of friends and I came here for happy hour one weekend. Their happy hour is every day (including weekends) from 5-9PM which is pretty nice.

They have three cocktails on their happy hour menu for $7 each... so we ordered all three:
-- The Hunter: Old Forester bourbon, fresh lemon and orange juice, honey, dash orange bitters on the rocks
-- Falls Royale: vodka or gin, fresh blood orange juice, simple syrup, champagne
-- The Rustic: Hendrick's gin, fresh grapefruit juice, fresh lemon juice, agave nectar, tonic on the rocks

I don't think any of them was bad, but I preferred the Falls Royale to the other two. You can choose vodka or gin for that cocktail so I went with vodka. I think it was a good choice :)

During happy hour they also offer $5 well drinks, $4 beer, and $6 beer and a shot. After we finished our three cocktails, one friend ordered a glass of Prosecco and we also got the $6 beer and shot. Gotta take advantage of those HH prices ;)

The Falls is pretty small and seating is really limited. We had to stand around the bar for a while before we were able to sit down. The bartender was nice but we didn't talk with him very much. Overall this is a chill place to grab a couple of drinks with friends, especially if it happens to be HH. Just be warned that it can get crowded quite easily.</text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) BAR I first came in LA came for the first time, the sense of music is good and the clerk is also cute and fun.

I definitely want to go again.

(Translated by Google) The food is fine, but the music made me come in and I didn't go out anymore, they have a live jazz group, super super cool.

La comida esta bien, pero la música me hizo entrar y ya no me salí, tienen un grupo en vivo de jazz, super super chido.</Text>

We feel relaxed entrusting our property in the hands of Don and his team. He is reliable and great at communicating. Had my house sold well over asking in these trying times in which he made seemed easy and seamless. His professionalism and negotiating the sale with all parties involved were exceptional. The overall experience was extremely positive with Don.< /Review>

A friend recommended Don to us to help sell our home, and we were so happy with the results. His support was great and we were always informed and kept up to date with the sale of our property. The process went quickly and without any problems. We are very happy that everything went well and will highly recommend Don and the Silicon Valley Real Estate team.</Review>

<Text>The Silicon Valley Real Estate Team was helpful beyond their call of duty. We had some issues with our mortgage company that was not fixed, and they extended help every step of the way for us to sell the property within our timeline and still be able to buy the home of our dreams. They made us feel very comfortable and were trustworthy. A welcoming and refreshing change from the typical real estate interactions one has come to expect as everything went much quicker and more relaxed than we expected. Definitely recommend them to everyone who is searching for a real estate agent to help them buy or sell a property.</Text>< Time>

Don did an impeccable job with the sale of my parent's home. He supported my parents through every stage of the sale and all the events related to it. The whole process of looking for a buyer as well as dealing with paperwork was more than enjoyable and easy with his involvement. All the way, he was professional and helpful in which is sometimes hard to find.<//Text>

From the moment we met Don, we could tell that he truly cared about us and would do everything possible to make sure we found our dream home. We were so impressed with how he negotiated our desired price for the home and walked us through to victory. Yes! It's a victory for us! Every step of the process was seamless and could not have made us feel more comfortable and positive.

<Text>Don and his team are amazing, hands down. It was my first time purchasing a home, so as you can imagine, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Don was incredibly patient, an excellent guide, a thoughtful listener, and his experience shone in every interaction we had (from our first tour through the final inspection after closing!) One of the best parts of the process was Don's coaching on the hot market, setting expectations around offers, contingencies, timing, etc. We ended up making 3 or 4 offers before finally getting one accepted, and each one was painless with Don walking us through everything. We'll strongly recommend Don to all our friends, and we'll definitely collaborate with him again on the next home.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I used them in June of this year. YES! Right in the height of this pandemic! Don helped us through the process, answered all our questions with no sugar coating, and did not pressure us in closing on any house. Truly a caring and a phenomenal person. All he promised from the beginning he delivered, 100%!

I have so many wonderful things to say about this team. They treated us like friends and respectfully, unlike the previous realtor that only saw us like $$$.
They are personable in all aspects of the process and incredibly knowledgeable about the entire real estate market procedures, and how to make your life easy working with them. From our first meeting, we felt like we were in good hands, and we knew they were truly listening to what we wanted in our next home. We were able to review some listings within a day, all of which fit the bill of what we were expecting. With an offer that we thought was way too low but all we could afford,  Don and his team made it happen.
Having a place to call our own and not waste money on rent has been my dream for so long. Thank you, guys, for making it a dream come true!!!<//text>

<review>If you want to sell your property quickly and for the most money, hire Don and his team. Their recommendations are based on expertise and years of experience. From the initial communication, listing preparation, negotiations, and final closing, they kept everything open and were very professional. Don's Ultimate Marketing Plan is what made the difference. Thank you, Silicon Valley Real Estate Team. You are the BEST!< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Buying a home in the Bay Area can be a big hassle. If you have experienced making offers and having your offers continually turned down, then you will know what I am talking about. Our home buying experience before we came to this agency was a nightmare. The first buyer agent we worked with was inexperienced and unresponsive. Long story short, the first agent helped us make an offer on a house and we offered a lot more than the asking price. We were very confident that we would get the house, but unfortunately, we failed. Right before the house's offer due date, we went to check out another open house and Ian was the seller agent of that house. I talked to Ian and explained our situation with the house that we had just made an offer on that wasn’t accepted. Thomas told us right away that he could help us make an offer again on the same house. Ian said that his strength was negotiating the price, which was what I really needed help with. I asked him to go check out the house again with us the next day. After checking the house, Ian told us about his strategy on how he would make the offer and I was REALLY IMPRESSED BY HIS SOLID STRATEGY! Surprisingly, our offer got accepted this time, and our offering price this time was actually 10k less than the first time when we failed with our previous agent. Not only that, our appraisal price was lower than our offering price so Ian helped us negotiate the price to another 15k lower. We ended up purchasing this house for 25k less than our first offer made by the previous agent we worked with. Want this good luck happen to you too? Call Ian!<//Review>

We recently purchased a new construction home with the help of Don Orason. In my dealings with the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team, I have found them to be extremely professional, helpful, and willing to assist and offer guidance throughout the process of purchasing our new home. We highly recommend Don and his team for peace of mind and an honest, transparent approach.</Text>

Don stuck with us, despite a 2 year 'pause' in our intent to sell.  He was always available, professional, fully knowledgeable, and spot on regarding his recommendations about how to prepare the house for sale without over-spending in the process.  His vast resource of contractors was indispensable and critical to our preparation.  When it came to pricing, he was honest with us, while also not under- or over-promising...just the right balance to help manage our expectations realistically.  His sound advise resulted in the sales price coming in well over asking.  We are grateful for Don's and his team's work.<//Text>

My family lives in South San Jose and I work in Santa Clara, quite a distance to commute every day. After being in that norm for almost six years, I'd had enough, and contacted Don about selling our house in South San Jose so we could move closer to my work. Best decision ever! Don helped us get the best offer for our home that was quite enough to be used during our transition and also helped us get a place in Santa Clara that best fits our needs as a small family. He was truly a delightful agent who helped me along every step of the process. Stress-free! Worry-free!< /Text>

<review>After getting a few recommendations from friends, that's when I knew what a great realtor Don is. I can honestly say without him we wouldn't have found our home or someone would have beat us to it! He is caring and does an honest business with his clients. I also appreciated how he continuously checked in on us, send us homes we might like to view, and listened to what type of home and area we wanted to stay in. He is very patient and personable in all approach from day one until we landed on the perfect home for us!
I couldn't recommend him enough.< /review>< Date>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We can't say enough good things about working with Mr. Orason and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team. Having him help us with our home search feels like we all have the luck in the world. His insights and decades of experiences in the real estate market, including his wide connections, helped us to get the best deal for our home. He brought us to several places to see some options. He was absolutely on top of the game and immensely energetic in working with all the other parties to ensure a swift and successful outcome. A really good communicator who does not just make promises but delivers them.
I am proud to say that he was our realtor of choice.  And we feel we made the very best decision by choosing to work with Don and his team. He has our 100% recommendation.< /Review>< pictures>

Don's team has honest answers to every question we had and set the tone for success. It never seemed possible to me since I was, yes I admit it, scared to deal with the whole process- like taking care of the paperwork and the worry that I might not be getting the house that's worth what I'm paying. But thanks to Don and his team, they have made this whole ordeal so easy. Great professionalism and attention to detail.<//Text>< Pics>

I cannot put into words how happy and fortunate we were to have Don as our real estate agent! We got him as an agent by accident, and what a happy accident it was! Everybody agrees surely that buying a house could be very, if not always, stressful, but not with him! Don's knowledge and friendly demeanor led us through our first home purchase so seamlessly.
If you are looking to buy or sell your home or property, trust me when I say that this man is the best man for you.< /Text>

We are so glad we found Don and appreciated so much his hard work in helping us sell our home in Santa Clara.
He was with us every step of the way. Very knowledgeable and understanding with boundless energy and positivity for which we were very grateful.
We listed it 5 weeks before the move-out date. During this time, he dealt with the occupants very graciously for open house access & more and had it sold in 4 days.  I am so impressed that everything went smoothly and better than we expected.
We would recommend Don to anybody needing and wanting one of the very best realtors.< /text>

We first used Don Orason and his Team in 2017 to purchase a house in San Jose, which went seamlessly. Fast-forward 3 years, we listed our house again with them. It was a complicated process due to the mistake we committed concerning our mortgage and a few unfinished renovations we did in our home.  Don worked so hard to negotiate for us and get us a great deal. We always felt informed and confident in them. Best of all, we got the best deal in the end.
We would recommend them to family and friends.< /text>

Don and his team at Silicon Valley Real Estate got us into the home of our dreams! Don has extensive experience and knowledge about the market here, can't be beat! Even through all the hoops that Covid makes realtors jump through to see houses, Don was amazing at scheduling and showing us the homes we wanted to see. We've been settled in our Eichler dream home for a couple months now, and looking back I'm so impressed with how smoothly the process went. And it's all thanks to Don and his All Star team!</Text>

<review>We wanted to move to Silver Creek Country Club in San Jose and needed the help of a realtor and expert to help us, and also sell our home in Sunnyvale. We found Don after spending hours searching online. Don helped us expedite the entire process. He showed us 7 or 8 different places. At the end of that day, we were confident in knowing we had found the perfect place for us.
Don also helped us prepare our home for sale. He has a list of highly qualified professional contractors that can help you with just about any project you wish to do around your home; painting, flooring, handyman, electrician, contractors for remodeling (large and small jobs), landscaping and more, and at very good prices.
Don negotiated to help us get the best offer, and was able to move in just a few days after seeing the place. He made our transition as painless and straightforward as possible. The best!<//review><gmap_id>0x808e33de980e4851:0x17a1dc423b5d371b</gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< rate>

His real estate knowledge and expertise are absolutely the best. What I valued most was his understanding, passion for his job, and compassion towards his clients. It made the entire relocation process, easy for us- from our first phone call all the way to the day I signed the contract.
Absolutely, 5 stars.<//text>

I would recommend the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team. They are hands down the best-in-the-business.
Our property went on the market the very week that the Covid-19 lockdown began, yet the team did not miss a beat and still managed to get our property sold in 1 week!  Not to mention that we received multiple offers and a higher price than we could have imagined.</Review>

Shout-out to Don and his professional team. They assisted me in selling my home, and I couldn't praise them highly enough for making it so easy despite I don't have much knowledge about the process. I really appreciated that they provided me constant communication, updates, and guidance that was crucial in the sale of my property!  Their Ultimate Marketing Plan must be seen if you are thinking of selling!
Everything went very smooth and our home was sold at the above asking price, even with the changing market. Highly recommend!</text>

Don is a trusted realtor with abundant knowledge and appreciation of the Silicon Valley area. He enthusiastically showed us several units and helped us get the home that we truly wanted. He made our life so much easier during the entire process.
Prior to everything, he explained that it currently was a strong seller's market and outlined a strategy to increase our chances of getting our offer accepted without overpaying for the home.

I got a great offer of a "Work-Transfer", and I was trying to figure out where I would live in NorCal if I accept the offer. I did check out a few listings online but ended up not calling any of them because of the fear that someone might rip me off.
A workmate recommended Silicon Valley Real Estate Team and even dialed the first phone call for me. Yay!  From there, I was able to get a hold of Don. Don helped me check out some homes in the  Campbell and Los Gatos areas and within just one day, I got my heart set on a place that seemed like it was going to be really competitive. We presented our offer, and after a few rounds of back-and-forth, we had a closed deal! Don took care of every detail, including a ton of paperwork that I luckily just had to review and sign. I was lucky enough to have Don on my side to make sure everything went smoothly.
PS;  I'm moving in very soon. So excited!!!< /review>

I didn't expect to find a property that quick with Mr. Orason. I was only in the city for a week, and he moved around his busy schedule to squeeze me in, and ended up finding me an awesome property. I am truly grateful for all the effort he made to find me exactly what I wanted.
Above all, Don Orason is just so much fun to work with, it feels like we're just a friend looking at houses. Thanks a lot!<//text>

Excellent Service.  Our original realtor was no help at all. We barely had any appearances and no communication nor feedback. We decided to dump his company and find a reliable realtor.  We came across Don Orason and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team through a common friend.
Unlike the previous one, Don possesses all the qualities a home seller or buyer is looking for. He was so helpful and responsive all along the way. Along the process, we had a couple of tricky details in the negotiations, and we found Don to be an excellent negotiator on our behalf.
Also, his comps were thorough, and he even gave very good reasoning about every detail of each home. He is undoubtedly the best realtor I have known. 5/5 stars!< /text>

We have dealt with many real estate agents in the past and Don is definitely at the top of the list. He's very professional, he knows the area and provides accurate comps to his clients. He sold our house within a week and for a higher price than what we were asking. He's got a great team, probably has the best photographer and inspector, and he's always available.

If you're thinking of selling your home or buying a home, you'd be doing yourself a huge favor by talking with Don and having him work for you.</Text>

< Review>
Don listed my parent's home on the 5th of August this year and just exactly 12 days from the day it was listed, it was SOLD and closed escrow. I could tell immediately that he always has his customer's best interest at heart. His knowledge of real estate is top-notch, and he is driven to get the job done.
We couldn't be happier that our property went for well over asking price and was a very smooth transaction.<//Review>

I'm still in awe of how fast things happened with Don. He knows the market, has the relationships, and his fee structure will save you money as well.
As a seller, Don was prompt and communicative as he helped me connect with potential buyers, schedule meetings, secure the best offer, and close transaction quickly. The best in the business!<//Review>

<review>Would highly recommend the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team to help you find your next home!
Mr. Orason provided me an honest perspective from his years of real estate experience, and he is quick to respond. For a first-time home-buyer like me, it means a lot, and I felt so blessed to have worked with him.</review></record>

We had a great experience working with Don and his team on the purchase of our property in Santa Clara, CA.
Don was nothing short of spectacular and helped us to find the perfect home at the best price and in our preferred location. There were many things that were scary and I was not knowledgeable of, but Don helped and guided us through the process and once we found the right home, he negotiated the offer as if it was for himself, it was an amazing experience. Pretty impressive negotiator, knowledgeable of the overall market, assertive and very polite. In the end, we got our offer accepted and love our new home.
The best realtor and real estate team ever!</Text>

Our whole family relocated to the San Jose area on relatively short notice, and we wanted to find a home instantly.  Don was an excellent guide in our home search. After a week, we had an offer accepted on a house and moved in within just a couple of weeks.
Don also works with inspectors who are very honest with the findings of the inspections and suggested a few ideas on how we can fix them and save a huge amount of money.
We had no setbacks on our path to closing, and we are very pleased with our home.< /Review>

Nowadays, it's very rare to work with someone who genuinely cares about you and your welfare as much as I experienced with Don Orason and his team. They had our back 100% during the whole process of finding the best home for our family. Don was always there when we needed clarity about the step-by-step process, helping us with the paperwork, and negotiating the best offer. He was very professional, prompt, and proactive.
It was a stressful time for the entire family, but the team turned what is typically a stressful situation into a super smooth process.  Highly recommend.< /Review>

Don is both a great realtor and now a new friend.  As a home buyer that didn't know much about the San Jose market, I cannot possibly emphasize how blessed I was to have found someone so honest, so patient, and so knowledgeable to guide me through the home buying process.
Don was there for me and my family from the beginning to the end. He provided a great knowledge and guidance and not once did I feel pressured by him or from anyone else on his team. Even though I asked a lot of questions, they were more than happy to address them all without any hesitation.
Thank you so much for the seamless home buying experience.< /text>

The best part is their ability to provide prompt responses, which made the home buying process so smooth.<//review>

<review>Wonderful Experience!  Due to the recent change in the real estate market, we were a little nervous about selling our home.  After interviewing 5 different realtors and brokers, we chose to work with Don and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team.  His marketing plan and listing strategy was very impressive and were the reason we picked Don over the others.
Everything went very smooth and the results were even better than we imagined!  Don was always a step ahead of every detail of the transaction and navigated us through the sale, which ended up a remarkable success!  The best realtors in the industry.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It is so good to know that you are working with a man that is not only a service provider but also a friend that you can trust. As a first time home buyer in SF, having a sufficient knowledge about the area is critical in finding the best place that would suit us the best in starting a new life.
Don is not only remarkably informed but also very generous with his time in listening and understanding what we really wanted and needed. He guided us through the process and gave us the best home to enjoy. We will be forever grateful.< /Review>

Don was our realtor for our recent home purchase in San Jose, CA, and I couldn't recommend him highly enough for the hard work and dedication he shewed, to make the daunting task easy and less stressful. He helped us navigate such a high stakes deal smoothly, and despite the competitive NorCal area market, he gave us the excellent home we desired for so long.
Moreover, he was patient, extremely responsive, and went out of his way to make himself available for our many questions. If you're looking for a home in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley, I highly recommend you call this company.</Review>

<Review>Working with Don and his team to purchase our home was like hitting a jackpot in a Lottery. I can honestly say if he wasn't with us, we would have probably given up. Don reassured us and made our dream a reality. We were a bit skeptical at first, but as time went on we easily became comfortable because of his genuine care and experienced first-hand knowledge about real estate and the local market. No matter how many questions we asked he was there and was always willing to answer in detail. He truly had our best interests at heart. For that, 5 stars!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Don and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team are incredible! They had our condo listed and sold over asking within a week. Don was very thorough and organized in getting our place in shape and priced the condo perfectly. I couldn't believe that we had multiple offers in that very short span of time. That was really quick and saved us a lot of worry, anticipation, and money!  They are genuinely nice and totally honest, and I am so pleased to have found them.< /Review>< userid>

I have been looking for a home for the past 4 months and have talked to several realtors and have had a difficult time. Most of them didn't actually listen to exactly what I needed and just trying to push what they wanted.
I came across Don and his amazing team.  He really cares and took his time to listen to my needs, and found me the most incredible home. He is so knowledgeable and made everything a breeze for me.
Definitely, the best Realtor and team of real estate agents out there and I'm just grateful that I found him and his company.<//Review>

As a first time home buyer, I did not know much about every aspect of home buying. So I decided to look for a real estate expert in the San Jose area. Don far exceeded my expectations. He explained in detail how to make a great offer that would be accepted in this very competitive market. He was there for me every step-of-the-way. After the offer was accepted, Don sent me all of the information I needed for the next step, outfitted us with some referrals for inspectors of all types. He came to the home inspection and pointed out additional things for our punch list based on a great eye and years of experience. Plus, he helped me with my final walk through and continued to check in afterward to make sure all final things were addressed. Everything was done smoothly because of his presence. A million thanks!!< /text>

<Text>Don was simply amazing! We thought that finding a new house could take a couple months, but we found the one we wanted sooner than we expected through his help. He really came through for us, helped us understand what the price point would be and what would be a competitive offer, he kept us organized, and he just gave us the house we really wanted. It was indeed a very seamless home buying experience.< /Text>< pics>

I cannot say enough about Don's Positive attitude, overflowing knowledge and most importantly patience to get our home sold for the right price.
Don met all of our criteria in selling our home. From the right price, right buyer, the right support and to the right timing. I usually don't find any realtors that actually deliver what they say, until I found Don Orason and the entire Silicon Valley Real Estate Team.
This company definitely has my lifetime business and 100% recommendation.<//Review>

Even in this market we felt we got a great deal on our home purchase.  Our time and hard earned money was well spent because of their help. They showed us many places that we fell in love with and could potentially get. Don was so helpful; he went through the entire home buying process so we did not have any surprises and he always made sure everything worked out. I received calls and regular emails showing properties in my range and Don and his team work around my schedule, even helped me through the financing process. I couldn’t be happier with the service I received from them. I highly approve Don Orason and his real estate company!<//text>< Pictures>

I want to make a few comments of why I liked Don Orason and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team and why others should strongly consider using them.
First, the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team has earned their reputation by performing TRUE exceptional service. Their main concern is not the sales/profit, but the customer's satisfaction! They want to see smiling faces with all their customers after everything is completed and have clients for life!
Second, Don, the owner, is always available. Whether it is during the day or night, or even on weekends. He is willing to go the extra mile to respond to the client's concerns and questions. He is very patient and great to work with.
Lastly, they were the best realtors I know in the Northern California area. Their records speak to that. They know the market extremely well and will put your best interest at heart. A great team of realtors with professionalism and excellent customer care.
I have used them twice and will use them again. Talk with Don and his team and see it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.</Review>

We've found our new home with the help of Don, and it was a perfect fit. The entire process was completed smoothly. This man deserves all my praises. We would definitely recommend him to our friends.</text>

I used Don's services six and a half years ago when I was looking to buy a home. It was a very competitive market, but he found the perfect place for my kids and I. So in September when I decided to semi-retire to Tucson, I called Don and his team.

He sold my townhouse with a week at a price above what I was asking and with a two-week escrow.

Not only that, but I had already moved to Arizona when it was selling, and Don was happy to help with the last minute details for prepping it for sale.

Don Orason and his team are professional, knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. They stay on top of the transaction so that everything is seamless.

I highly recommend them.</Text>

We can't say enough about our positive experience working with Don and his team. We hadn't moved in 35 years and thus the whole idea of finding a place in the area we desired and selling the home where we reared our family was unsettling to say the least. Don and his team, however, were professional in the way they handled the sale of our former home; marketing it to show its value to buyers resulting in a flood of interest in the home and several offers for us to consider. In addition, we were looking for a home in a specific location where homes are not readily available. Don found a home for us that met all our needs in the location we wanted. All this was accomplished in six weeks. That's pretty incredible.</review>

Don Orason and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team was referred to me by a co-worker.  He told me that Don had sold his home and helped him and his wife purchase a new home...he had so many great things to say about how wonderful Don and his team had made the entire experience.

I then decided to do a little research myself before contacting Don and found many reviews and websites showing us how experienced and qualified he was to be our realtor of choice.  I contacted his office and spoke with his assistant Kitty (who we just love), she answered most of our initial questions and setup an appointment with Don.  We knew after just a few minutes of our initial meeting that Don was the perfect man for the job!  His knowledge of the local real estate market was awesome.  He always gave us options and explained in detail, different scenarios when submitting our offer on our home.  We were so happy with the final results...a great price on a great home!!  And Don was able to negotiate a wonderful price in a multiple offer situation, by adjusting the terms.

We are so glad we found Don Orason and the Silicon Valley Real Estate Team.  The best team of realtors in  the area!!< /review>

Delicious,  fresh, authentic Ethiopian food. The injeera is to-die-for. Really nice vegetarian and vegan options available, generous portions,  great service.< /Review>

<Review>Delicious casual dining spot with helpful table service.   Restaurant was clean and service was quick.  Enjoyed the vegetarian sampler plate for two.  Food was fresh and had many flavor levels.  Beer and wine available.   I recommend Cafe Ethiopia.  Good for single or large groups.</Review>< Resp>

Yummy! Delicious and authentic Ethiopian food in the heart of the Mission. We opted for the Vegetarian platter for 2 and enjoyed everything very much. Prices are reasonable, they have beer and wine (both Ethiopian and American), friendly staff, and the food is great.</Text>

Love this place, I keep coming for lunch to here, even on my own. It’s a small family-run restaurant, it’s not very busy and so waiters pay attention to you. Delicious and healthy food. Pricewise, it’s average for Mission. I’m surprised people don’t come to eat here every second day, they should.<//review>

Put aside the ambiance. You are here for the food. Go for the mixed platters. Break the bread rules for the injera. Service is relaxed, so don't come here in a rush. I've been coming here for more than a decade and never been disappointed.<//Review>

Super nice people, tasty honey wine and good food. 4 stars only because I felt the food could be more flavorful. I'd like to go back and try a meat dish.

The restaurant is spotless and an interesting layout. It looks like you can rent a space in the back and I'd use that for smaller meetings/gatherings.

Will be back for sure!</text>

<Text>I love Ethiopian food. This restaurant is consistently good for Ethiopian cuisine. Vegetarian/vegan options here are delicious. I recommend the stewed whole lentils. Their injara (sourdough crepes) are perfect--not too sour, and stretchy enough to handle their dishes without falling apart (unless soaked through with sauce).<//Text>< Pics>

a quiet birthday dinner with delicious lamb,  #9 very heavy on the chili powder.  the chicken and spinach were flavored nicely. Ethiopian tea was nice on a chilly evening,  and the honey wine is nice to share.  I'm looking forward to trying more dishes.</Text>

Its appears to be a family run place. Nice service. Traditional food served on clean glass tables in a small cozy space.< /review>

Having jumped at the chance to try as many Ethiopian restaurants as possible, I love this place the best.  Their food is delicious and the owners are lovely people - highly recommended!</Text>

There is something relaxing in eating food with your hands. Of course you're not using bare have, but most of the Ethiopian dishes come with injera, a thin crepe-like flatbread, that can be used to grab and wrap small bites. Ethiopian dishes are often hot and always spicy. For instance, kitfo is similar to a steak tartare served with cottage cheese and vegetables. The restaurant is not particularly exotic and, if you're looking for the full Ethiopian experience, that might let you down, but the food is amazing and definitely worth a try. An interesting deviation from the usual dinner</Text>

Solid Ethiopian food. Don't have to trek to the TL or Oakland! We got the veggie combo and beef tibs. Tibs were solid. Loved the cabbage, carrot, and potato (by far my favorite veggie Ethiopian dish). The red lentil dish was too strong on the spice, so it wasn't as flavorful. Collard greens solid.<//review>

My first time having Ethiopian food, while on vacation in SFO. I loved it. The food was phenomenal and we got a glass of the Tejj and it was awesome, paired really well with the food. I would go back in a heartbeat.< /Review>

It was alright, nothing particularly special. There's only one guy waiting tables so service is a bit slow. Food is more heavily spicy than other Ethiopian places I've been, so the flavour isn't as complex but it was still good.<//review>

The food is great, the service is great, lovely location, BUT the wine list uncommonly bad. Don't go there with someone who orders wine with dinner whenever they go out. Or try to dissuade them. Besides that this is a wonderful place.< /review>

The food at Café Ethiopia is good.  I ordered the veggie combo (carrots, potatoes, cabbage, yellow split peas, and spicy lentils) and ate the entire thing.  The portion size is smaller from the other Ethiopian/Eritrean places I've dined in, but the price is reflective.  It was about $1-$2 cheaper here.

The décor and atmosphere are minimal.  They focus everything on the food, I suppose.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.

The only issue I had was the cleanliness of the bathroom.  I wash my hands before every meal, especially if I'm eating Ethiopian food.  It wasn't the cleanest, and it was very, very small.  The trash can is literally right in front of your face.. Maybe if I was taller it wouldn't have felt so close.

It' the only Ethiopian restaurant in the Mission.  It's worth a try if that's what you're craving.</review>

The food is great, if you can get over how bad the service is. I've been going here for two years, and they've changed waitresses at least 5 times in that time period, and most of the time the only people working there are the husband and wife team. That would be fine, except that the husband is so rude! If you try to order the veggie combo for less than 4 people, he will look at you like you're dumb. He can be so condescending. Everytime we go there, we say we're never going back, but the food is so good & it's so close to our house. Axum Cafe is the best Ethiopian food in the city, but it's so far away and hard to find parking!</text>

Wonderful service and food. The space is decorated with an eclectic mix of Ethiopian paraphernalia, not charming, but clean.< /Review>

Loved #6 Zigini (kay Wat) spicy beef and #14 Bersin (Misir Wat): spicy split red lentil. #2 Tibsie Derho (Doro Tibs) chicken sautéed in tomato sauce would be good to try spicy!

Everything else was great.</Review>

<Review>Review for food on the outside. I  We're here for the first time and didn't know that they put cheese in the asada burrito and my daughter cannot have cheese. So. When I asked for a new burrito the cook offered to exchange it for free, but I didn't feel right. So I just paid for another one. It wasn't their fault. It was mine. 👍Good customer service though on their 0art.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Asada Tacos were awesome. Reminiscent of King Taco back in the day when it was still good. Had the tacos from the late night food truck not the restaurant.</Review>

<Review>We love their tacos! The crunchy cod is my favorite. My partner likes the salmon and the carnitas tacos. The fresh ingredients and handmade tortillas make them so delicious! I highly recommend this Mid-City neighborhood Mexican restaurant.<//Review>< pictures>

Despite the fact it is a nondescript strip mall off of a Chevron station, this is a gem of a restaurant. Starting with the fresh salsa bar, then a taste of fresh juice, and finally I had two amazing fried cod tacos.

The servers were very helpful and nice. This is worth a trip up the 5 freeway to taste fresh seafood, new American style dishes, and awesome Latin plates. I want to try some of the pasta dishes and I really want to check out their breakfast offerings. Check this place out!</text>

Fantastic food! This place has a little bit of everything but the Mexican food is phenomenal. All of the salsas are great (including salsa verde). Meals are reasonably priced (all of ours were around $10/each). Would highly recommend this place.< /text>

Really good food! The black beans are delicious. The pinto beans are perfectly spicy. There's a sweet salsa I've never had ever & it's one of my favorites. The flavorful barbacoa tacos have as much meat as any burrito I've had before. The fresh chicken quesadillas, the organic kale & spinach smoothies made right in front of you, the cucumber lemonade... Just go already! You'll see me there for sure.<//text>

<username>Bobby iascone<//username><review>EAT HERE BEFORE THIS PLACE GETS FAMOUS!!!

This place is a little treasure. Hidden behind a chevron gas station in what could be a neighboorhood described as the closest thing to the south side of Chicago that you can find on the west coast. Inexpensive food , OVERWELMING FLAVOR, the bbq tacos with the pineapple salsa, carnitas the meat lovers bennidict, lobster burrito, alaskan cod burrito anything else you can order, its all hand crafted and filled with deliciousness and dont cheat yourself make sure you get the honey salsa from the salsa bar♡ i cant believe this place exisit in this area, by far the best food around!! The only reason there isnt a line out the door every hour theyre open is because the hipsters are affraid to come in the neighborhood. The food is so alluring that you will come back.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Epic tacos! I ordered two veggie tacos from the green menu. As a vegetarian food, I am super impressed. They we're awesome. I also got a side of beans, that we're teaty and light as well. The service was also super friendly.  Will be back for sure.<//Review>

<Review>Cute little place,  family run.
I had a shrimp taco it came on a handmade tortilla stuffed with shrimp, cabage, salsa....and absolutely delicious. I also had 1 Carne asada taco it also came on a homemade tortilla and it was so good. I had the 2 tacos and Orchata for drink and I'm stuffed. They have a salsa bar with very delicious and different salsas.
I will be coming back, hope to see you here :)<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0pTsa87_X1z6LdyuAiIAdPbwkizAUk1jj1V8d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNevW40uD6O1ajwR-09efMqZzh3Xoaw9RYjvpdT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8n-gk2Kr77yT3Vqq9ZLKxhSaghykPH4F-lW7P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPODHg25Ve1XodqdODEvXcYoMRJ6IBf8anVdT76=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1eLy3DMUD5UklFE__XrOhsZarh74xuuY_7PzG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO49XXOc_5kvJWMbk-KNQW5d7kDWsFMZrhCxFgd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c29440709d932f:0x83f644c6b9a35560<//gmap_id></record>

Yesterday was the first time we came to that restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the good service, with the exceptional  cuisine and booze and with the modest charge. We will absolutely visit there in a short time.< /text>

Best Mexican restaurant in town! They're very generous with the portion sizes and everything on the menu is absolutely DELICIOUS!! More people need to know about this place. They even have a vegetarian/vegan "green" menu and they're super friendly. Highly recommend!<//Review>

<Review>2020.03 - Update
I wish Google had an "update review" or "post another recent review" option - it would make life easier! Well, this place is great for some seafood! Staff is still awesome and food is still consistently cooked well! The pricing to portions after the six years of visiting this joint is still great! Overall a great one for a truly hidden gem! Their house salsa is addicting. Do not overeat and fill up with chips! Lol 😂 It's the red, slightly thick, lightly sweet and shiny looking salsa. They need to sell gallons of it because I'd buy it! Definitely stop in for some killer stuff. Takeout is excellent, too!

Park at McDonald's (plenty of parking) and walk around or on the street if you can't find a spot in the tiny shopping center lot. It's at a gas station attached to a 7-11 on a busy intersection so parking goes quick.

A year ago: Love the staff here! They're always so pleasant! The food here is delicious! We frequent RJM for our company lunches! All the seafood dishes here are definitely a must try! Especially the Ahi Tuna Salad. The tuna is always made to perfection! The prices and portions are reasonable, too. I only need two tacos! If you're really hungry, three is perfect but you will be stuffed! Their complimentary salsa bar is fantastic! Their red salsa is....addicting. I can't say enough about this place because the staff also makes every visit enjoyable! It's connected to a gas station so the only problem is parking! Other than that, a perfect spot when you're craving seafood!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I wanted to love this place I really did, but after eating here everyday for a week, trying many different items on the menu, the quality of the food just wasn't worth the price.  I was averaging $24 a visit with all the food, drink, and dessert I was ordering.  They are charging downtown LA prices in crappy Sun Valley.  Also the service is slow and of low quality.  The young guy who works there is incompetent when taking orders.  He has taken my food to the wrong table and flat out forgot to bring me my drink order.  I ended up walking out before my expensive meal arrived this last visit.  I'm sorry, but when someone is spending $20+ for food the service better be top notch.  I won't be going back.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Whatever you do, do not place an order online through their website. Placed an order online about an hour ago thinking it would be ready for when I came in half an hour ago and it is still not ready. Gal at the register pretended like the order was almost ready but when I walked away heard her tell the other gal that the order was never confirmed and placed with the kitchen. Not even an apology was offered.<//review></record>

<text>First of all, the parking sucks but don't let that deter you. Second of all, if you're in a hurry or do not have patience, then this is not the place for you. Your food is not ready to be served when you walk in, you will have to wait.

The staff is super friendly and welcoming. When they bring you chips, feel free to go to the salsa bar, their salsa game is strong.

This is our second time here. My wife ordered and loved her strawberry French toast. I had the Angus steak taco, which I enjoyed. I would love to have one with just steak, a fried egg and some salsa, but I'm a simple person. I also had the carne asada and eggs. My food seemed to disappear. Everything is flavorful and well worth the wait.

As for the decor...listen, if you come here and you're more concerned with the decor than the food, honestly, find a nice chain restaurant to go to. I have been cooking professionally for more than half my life and places like this are few and far in between.<//text><GmapID>0x80c29440709d932f:0x83f644c6b9a35560<//GmapID>< user_id>

Once you find this gem it is definitely worth the visit, great service, great food. The salsa choices alone are worth the visit, recommend the salsa verde.</text>

Good food but they have a very big menu, at least 4 pages long, for such a small place. They should cut the large menu in half.< /Review>

Food is amazing and has big portions. Just keep in mind that if they say wait time is 15min they mean 30. Totally worth the wait though.<//review>

This place has everything for Breakfast , lunch and dinner , starting from pancakes to bomb Azz Carne Asada  , also shrimp tacos and fish tacos are huge and delicious here
100% recommended for those who loves to enjoy their food , delivery is another option for those who don't like to drive , so just call them , order some Huevos Rancheros , and wait for 30 minutes and someone will be asking for you at your front door,
Parking is always empty , gas station next to this place , auto parts store next to them too ,
And Hair Salon as well,
RJM is just one of the best restaurants here in sun valley CA , I work near by and I always call them fo deliver Service , sometimes I just go in when I have time , inside is very clean so organized , the guys are always doing something trying to keep it clean , there's a lot of tables too so is good for groups , big families , meetings etc etc , also some cops likes to come here and have a lunch so this place is so safe to theirs customers , their prices are fair enough , lil bit high but fair enough , fair bcuz the quality of their food is top priority for them , this place is not like any other taco restaurant , this place is just the best restaurant , only bcuz the quality and quantity in your plate , food looks good taste good and you feel like you just spent your money in the right way and you will come back for another round for sure , guaranteed< /review>

This place is a hidden jem. Not the average Mexican grill spot in that they have different types of dishes than that of your average mexican food spot. Service needs improvement tho. Usually get this young girl and she's great. Not worth it of she aint here in my opinion unless u get togo</review>

Salsa bar wasn't up to code  all the salsas were at room temperature and fruit flies were all up in the salsas  and had beans right next to it that werent hot . They had a chick doing phone orders and taking orders for us she was a hot mess yelling all mad .. she was a young  loud girl .. maybe have 2 people up front cause she couldnt handle it . ..she was asked to clean the salsa bar she didnt do it .. they ha d like 6 guys in back on the orders allover the food was okay  some was to spicy for us .. they also aadertise lobster but they didnt have any we tried thos place cause it had 4 stars but not close its like a spicy baja fresh flavor anyways seems like a busy restaurant if u like spicy<//Review>

This one is not for the store or product which is great.
This review is on Retail operation. Who runs a retail store and doesn't have backup idea or procedures in place. So you sales associate tells us the people in just got three new register systems and there down. So what is the back up procedure when register go out? Do you have manual invoices to uses to write down sale and product info. Do you phone line and number to manually call credit card in when using a manual Invoice. What the back up plan? If I was a owner or Corp. District Manager or Regional I would be very to know that by not having a back up plans this evening at Tustin store about $150.00 sales do not get sold customer couldn't be helped and the store lost money 09/18 about 8:30pm. Was in the store til 9:23 to try and buy something but no back up plan in place to not loss sales and anger customers and the poor employees too. Not knowing what to do. Word of the day BACK UP PLAN<//Review>

Great place to shop for all things Christian.  They often have good sales and discounts for different types of study Bibles and group studies.<//Review>

Good selection & ok prices; a nice place to read quietly or to pick up a nice gift.  Their rewards & gift card system can be a bit frustrating as it doesn't appear to be a centralized system, so be sure to always keep receipts; and better to not go if you're on a time crunch and need to conduct, returns, exchanges, or purchases with gift cards.<//Text>

Good experience shopping here. Knowledgeable staff that’s not just trying to meet quota, but who appear genuinely interested in their customers satisfaction.< /text>

My family and I came in from Phoenix and we were starving and called ahead to see if we could order food within 30 of closing - not something I like to do - and the gentlemen working had our food ready as we walked in the door. Thank you so much, it really made our night! Not only did we get great food but he was able to still fit in two local beers before close.

If you love a great selection of wine or a great selection of beer or a great patio or two then you will love it here.
If you love a very attentive and very knowledgeable staff with the best personality then you will love it here.
If you love a mom and pop ownership that will remember your name and wont hesitate to stop and talk for a moment to see if there is something you need or maybe sit and talk for a quick visit then you will love it here.
If you love to die of plates to go with your wine or beer then you sill love it here.
If you just love the ambiance of a cool place to go then...</Review>

This restaurant has a very friendly vibe to it. The staff was very nice, the food came out quickly and it was very good, albeit on the expensive side. They gave us free cheesecake sliders for a birthday we were celebrating and the owner came over and talked to us.  Overall a very nice experience. The chocolate cake was like fudge, very dense and moist. Delicious.< /Review>

I seldom write reviews, however felt compelled to share mv view of Bubbles & Brew. Having the opportunity to experience a wide variety of food, beverages, and services from establishments all over the world for many years may provide a little context.  I’m often surprised when reading a review where people are frustrated with their experience, related to either the food or services and judge the overall establishment.  An employee may be having a bad day, a cook may be overwhelmed at the time, or the food may not meet your expectations every time, which is likely to happen in any service establishment at some point.  When an establishment is busy, service will be impacted, it’s common sense.  What I’ve learned is we as consumers should take a moment to share this with management in a polite and professional manner if our food or service results a negative experience.  Most times, management will be appreciative and address the issue.   My wife and I have been visiting Bubbles for years, and have become repeat customers based on their delicious food, wine options, and pleasant service.  Not much of a beer enthusiast so unable to provide input with regards to the beer selection.  We like the option to sit on the patio, indoors, or in the garden, based on who we’re with and weather.  If you're looking for a unique relaxing experience with delicious food you will not be disappointed with your visit to Bubbles.  I bring friends, family, and business professionals to Bubbles and the feedback has been consistent, positive and memorable.  It’s also the reason we frequent this establishment.< /Review>

<text>This was the first weekend for outside dining in Morgan Hill and everything was great. We started at another place but the wait made us reconsider. Bubbles and Brew had limited service outback so we opted for the front tables, the one by the front door was nice and sunny and isolated. The server was busy but effecient and friendly. Wife had pork sliders, I had salmon crostini and a nice ipa the server suggested. Perfect afternoon after a long quarantine.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I haven't even been here yet, but I'm giving 5 stars for now simply because I noticed in reading the reviews the owners reply to every single review, even when the reviewer did not leave specific comments. This is a very strong signal to me about how much these owners care about their business, and I expect it will show in the quality of the restaurant. I'll update my review once I've had a chance to visit Bubbles.<//Text>

Tasty pub food (pork sliders, flat bread pizzas, spice sausage) and yummy beer choices. Try the Dragon's Milk stout!

Back patio live music by Jeff Nunes was excellent as well.</Text>

<review>Great atmosphere for a relaxing glass of wine. Love that dogs are welcome on the patio, and they even have treats for you to buy them. We are part of the Wine Club and enjoy going for the featured winery tastings on the 3rd Thursday of the month. They do a great job of pairing food with them and featuring some good wine. We tend to do a light dinner there when we only need something small to eat, but there is plenty of variety on the menu. They do offer a full 5 course meal as well which is fun to do.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Bubbles is basically a spot where you can try some different wines and have a snack if you're feeling hungry. The menu is pretty much limited to meats and cheeses and flatbread pizzas. You're not going to get a full meal but you can get small bites.

You can choose from glasses or bottles of wine or some pretty interesting flights. I decided to try their wines of South Africa flight. Unfortunately I didn't like any of the 3 wines offered. They all smelled and tasted a bit weird. But the server was accommodating and let me try a glass of Zinfandel instead that was much better.

If you're looking for a place where you can try a new wine and have a quick bite to eat in a laid back atmosphere, then Bubbles is for you.</text>

Pretty good! I like the prawn cocktail and the cheese plate, and the wines are - okay, although more local wines and Napa wines would be nice. They offer flights as well as by the glass/bottle and service is friendly. I do like the fact that they let you come with a dog, but now that has been relegated to a single table in front of the entrance, where people park their bikes, etc. I suppose some lame-o dog owner ruined it for everyone else, because they used to allow dogs on the main patio.<//Text>

<userid>101065754371375263178< /userid><review>This weekend my wife and I decided to check out Bubbles after they added a beer garden to their establishment. As huge Running Shop & Hops fans, we wanted to check out their offerings.

When we arrived I mentioned the beer garden and was quickly pointed to sit either inside the bar or out front. We were never given the opportunity to check out the garden. Once we sat out front, we were presented with menus. When I asked if they had any pilsners, is when I was given their beer menu. The prices appear to be a little higher than the Running Shop and obviously, the selection is a lot smaller. I ordered a pilsner and my wife ordered a flight of Pinot Noir.

As for food, this is where our experience took a turn for the worst. I ordered a pretzel and cheese and my wife ordered the strawberry and brie crostini. No kidding, it took 15-20 minutes to get the pretzel and another 15-20 minutes to get the crostini. By the time the crostini arrived, I was already done with the pretzel. When I asked why the crostini was taken so much more time than the pretzel I was told that the pretzel cooks faster. NOTE TO THE COOK: DON'T FIRE THE PRETZEL UNTIL THE OTHER ITEMS ARE ALMOST DONE! Nobody wants to eat alone.

Also, all crostinis are, are pieces of bread with melted brie and a slice of strawberry on top. It shouldn't take 30 to 35 minutes to prepare.

All in all, our visit was very disappointing. The service was poor, the food took F-O-R-E-V-E-R and beer aspect feels like an afterthought. It's too bad because we were thinking of hosting a birthday there since they offer both beer and wine.<//review><response>{'time': 1554324278236, 'text': "John, we're sorry to hear your visit here could've been better. We do our best to be as prompt as possible and to impress the quality of our menu. It'd be great to get a chance to truly wow you with our cuisine and service.

Very relaxed and comfortable spot to enjoy wine with food pairings.  They have an amazing selection of wine from local to international options.  The food menu is broad with alot of staples you would expect for a wine lounge (e.g cheese's, cured meats, desserts, etc).  They offer a quaint patio for nice weather.  It's a great place to visit either before or after a show at the theater across the street.<//review>

I drove 400 miles and stayed at a Holiday Inn across the street. I called and ordered a pasta dish to which they told me they were out of mushrooms and I substituted black olives. Then they called back and said they were out of pasta!. They asked if I wanted to order something else and I told them I'd have a medium pizza. The order total went up $10 and they didn't even offer to comp anything. I canceled the order. They are buffoons!<//text>

I have been ordering from this exact Domino's for the past 5 years and I have never had an issue. Pizza comes out great and all the food is delivered hot and on time. It may not be classic Italian-pizzeria styled pizza but if you need something fast and tasty, this is it! Thank you Mill Valley Domino's!< /review>

<text>Always under an hour (round table sometimes took up to two), delicious cheese, and very nice people. Some things to note include that if you pay ahead of time with a card, you will need to have said card on you when it is delivered, something that may be common, but something I haven't had to deal with before (obviously not a huge deal in most scenarios). I highly recommend using the website to order delivery, as the meter they have that tells you if the pizza is being prepared, cooked, or delivered, has always been accurate for me so far.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80858545430ccd6b:0x981df99ca3820cb1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Try something totally different. The chicken carbonara pasta is shockingly good! And, that chocolate lava dessert is to die for. The wings are really good, too. But I think they're much better if you get them plain w/ dipping sauce than the marinated ones. Otherwise, the sauce is so pervasive you can barely taste the wings. Truly.  I'm not a huge fan of the pizza - but this pasta/dessert combo is every bit as good as I'd expect at an expensive restaurant. Like I said, shockingly good.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

They’re the only place around that will deliver until 12am during the week and 1am on the weekends in mill valley. They even were able to get us pizza during the power outage so, obviously, five stars!<//review>

< review>
The owner of this Domino's is not an honest person. He will not honor any coupons or promotions that Domino's advertises online or on TV. This is fast food with low quality, cheap ingredients. No reason you should be unwilling to take a few dollars off of an order. Especially when your business is directly  benefiting from that advertising. I understand that your rent may be high, but that isn't reason to be seriously overcharging on crappy Pizza. I get it man, Mill Valley is expensive, maybe you should take your business elsewhere. We can get a pie with better ingredients at almost every local pizzeria for the same price. #domiNO's</review>

Ordered a pizza at 1130pm(love how this place is open till 1am) and gonzalo the delivery driver came just after midnight. Pulls up in front of my house. I asked how he was doing and he said "I'm doing ok, just got hit by a deer." I looked back at his car and he shined his flashlight on his windshield. THIS GUYS WINDSHIELD WAS COMPLETELY SMASHED! I was shocked and surprised he still came. GONZALO deserves a medal because this guy got his windshield SMASHED on the way to a delivery and instead of flipping out and turning around and calling it a night, he pressed on and finished the job.

<Time>1503814614731</Time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I placed an online order on the night of 8/26 , I was told after having paid for and completing my online order that if they could drive by Donahue st. Without having rocks thrown at their car they would deliver to my apartment on sherwood dr in Sausalito. I am very disipointed in the level of customer service at Dominose Pizza especially the mill valley location as I have been a loyal customer for many years. I hope that Dominos can raise their customer service standards to show a moderate level of concern for their long time customers. Nick should know better!!!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The usual quality. There's only place for 2x2 people to sit inside. If you don't specify the size they default to large which is huge...<//Text>

Ultrasound was done professionally and on time. Consult was via telephone-visit because I was out of town. Dr. Sivia explained everything in great detail and was on the phone with me for quite a while. The whole experience was top-notch!!! Highly recommended!!!</Review>

All staff members that I encountered were courteous and professional, without a doubt. If they were running behind, they kept me updated on my appointment status, which is appreciated. The actual procedures were relatively painless and fairly quick (which was fine by me). They also took care of all insurance pre-approval, which was great.

My one regret/negative comment is that I wish it would have been possible to have the 30-day post procedure appointment actually with Dr. Yu. I felt I was starting all over again in explaining things at this point with a different staff member (this happened a few years back as well so it was just not this time). I had concerns as the procedures did not resolve my leg swelling (though the procedures were successful) and I felt kind of bounced back to my primary care physician.< /text>

Early morning appointment.  Had to be nearly first, yet 1/2 hour wait.  Following that an appointment to which no one showed up. I walked out and 40 minutes later I received a phone call.  Guess no one missed me.  A day later the Doctor left a message on my phone.

Looking for another guy!</review>

<text>Waited nearly an hour for my Doctor to see me. I had a Appointment at 11am one morning and did not  see the Doctor for  one hour after that. Dr. Yu is a fine Doctor after I finally saw him. He knew how frustrated I was and explained the situation which is beyond his control! Its the managements fault for  over working the entire staff and not being able to give ample time to each patient. Doctors are over worked as well as staff there at Rancho Mirage Ca. More patients than can be handle ! Dr.Yu kept me from walking out and going else where!</text>< Response>

Excellent service from Dr. Yu and his staff! Dr. Yu explained the process during my procedures and made sure I was comfortable. He has a great personality and knows his profession. His ultrasound techs Wes and Brittney are always on time when they call me back to get my check ups and do a great job with a wonderful, welcoming attitude. His staff treats you great and are all very friendly. Great team work overall!< /Text>

< Review>
Outstanding!!! Everyone was so nice and professional. Dr.Yu was so gentle which made it so much easier to relax. He also was  able to explain every step of the procedure. I highly recommend this office. By the way, no pain
following the procedure which was very hard to believe.<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>I have had Dr Yu do several treatments. He is terrific!!  All went well, and I have recommended him to lots of people.  Generally, his staff is well trained and very nice.  My last experience was the exception.  I had a arterial ultrasound. I called twice to get a result. Finally, Carmen called and told me she had given me the oral report the week following the test.  No one called here with the report, if they had i would not have called the office. I am an RN...I know no report is normally good, however, I did ask her to please let me know the result. Disappointed in her.   The and Doctor and office deserves 5 STARS...she does not. Sorry.<//Text>< Rating>

I do not like seeing Physician  Assistants.  Desert Vein pushes all follow up with Physician Assistants.  As expected I was told that my condition would get better.  After requesting a copy of my last ultra sound it appears as though  not much was accomplished after having the prescribed  procedure done.  Perhaps I am wrong.  If that is the case someone should have reviewed the ultrasound and given me truthful information.< /text>

I asked several times what can be done about my veins on my ankle...they kinda brushed me off and stated no procedure was necessary. I wake up every morning with discomfort. Trying to heal something that would become a future problem....not satisfied. I hoped for More encouragement or fixing my issue before it may become worse.<//Review>

<text>From the beginning, my experience was very nice. I had an utrasound of both legs and confirmed my right leg had issues to be taken care of. Another appointment was scheduled to meet the doctor to review results. I met a Doctor and he described the procedures that needed to be done.3 Procedures were done very nicely, and was met, for follow up, every time by a nurse practitioner. There was never a close up review or before and after picture as to what had actually been accomplished in procedures, more of Reading this is what we did,  and all looks good. On my last follow up visit, I was on time for appointment, called my name and brought back to a room for pulse and BP Tests. I was told NP would see me in just a few to review results. I waited for over 25 minutes in this room for NP to show up, and explained to her I really do not understand what results if procedures were, and asked if I could see ultrasound pics and she asked “are you a professional, able to See results?” I said no, she said she was, but did not usually share this with patients. I asked her to send to my Doctor that referred me, and she said she would. At my insistence, NP did show me Ultrasound results.

You would think this would a SOP for this vein seal procedure,  happy to visually show before and after results. This was not what they did for me, and unhappy about that. I will ask my main Doctor to review the before and after Ultrasound results with me in my next exam.

< review>
I am a Kaiser member and I was contracted to come to this office for my varicose veins. I had an appointment today they said to be there at 1:15 so I took off work at at 11:45 a.m. this morning and drove an hour and a half to rancho mirage. Upon arrival they checked me in and I did an ultrasound. I was rather surprised because they did not tell me I had two appointments they told me only about the doctor. Even my text message reminder was only one appointment and that was at 1:30. I had another appointment scheduled at 3 because I figured an hour and 30 minutes was plenty of time to go to the doctor. I have several medical problems and I will be having heart surgery soon. I informed the clinic of my 3 p.m. appointment and they told me at 2:30 p.m. that there were still two consults ahead of me and the doctor was running behind. I asked them if they could see me after my other appointment and they still were not willing to accommodate me. They wanted me to schedule for another day take another 4 hours off of work and drive another round trip tank of gas. This is infuriating. I informed them that I have autism spectrum disorder and this caused a meltdown. The receptionist Monica was wonderful,b the office staff in charge of the decisions was absolutely terrible. They should pay me for my afternoon of missed work and tank of gas. I filed the complaint with Kaiser member services and with The department of managed health Care. I will also be putting reviews all over the Internet warning people so they don't waste their time and money coming to a doctor who runs behind and doesn't care about their patients time. they tried to blame me saying that the lady tells people when she books the appointment. Lies! Plus they should text people telling them about both appointments not just one. If they want to make things right they will reimburse me for my wasted afternoon and my gas.< /review>

<Review>The entire staff at Desert Vein & Vascular Institute is top notch.  They are friendly, efficient and well-organized.  The office is well-appointed and clean.   It is so refreshing to not have to wait forever to see the doctor.  They are always on-time!  Dr. Yu spent quality time with me in each of my visits.  He truly listened to me and explained my options for treatment in a clear and concise way.  It is very obvious that he is passionate about his career choice and really wants what is best for his patients.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I am thrilled to say that I would recommend Desert Vein & Vascular Institute to anyone.  I have had years of dealing with them and Dr. Sivia, he is a wonderful Doctor and took such good care of my elderly aunt in dealing with her amputations.  Always the highest of care.  Now he is doing procedures for me and I am completely satisfied with the operation of their offices and staff.< /text>

Very unpunctual doctors. They made me waste my time. My appointment was at 2 pm, I arrived at 1:45 pm, and I had to wait for more than 30 minutes. They never called my name. I asked the receptionist what was happening, and she couldn't answer me. I rescheduled my appointment and now I have to wait a whole month because of them. On top of that, the receptionist said she couldn't guarantee the doctor sees me on time in my next visit. That means that I'm going to have to wait in the waiting room who knows for how long that day again. Do they think they are the only ones who have to do important things?</text>

<Review>You are greeted as you walk in the door by staff. All staff members are very patient and kind. Dr. Derdari an spent a lot time discussing my vein problems and went into detail the various treatments to rectify  my problems. I left the office with no doubt I was in good hands at DVVI. Very positive feeling walking out the door.
I recommend them highly.</Review><date>1580277245638<//date>< Name>

Dr Yu has explained every detail of the procedures I have had on the veins in my legs.  He has been patient with my questions and has shown me what to expect each step of the way. Dr Yu and his staff are always pleasant, on time and caring.  I feel grateful that my primary Phy referred me to Desert Vein and in particular, Dr. Yu.  Thank you sincerely.  I no longer have pressure, redness, itching and swollen legs.  I had no idea this procedure would be such a success.!</review>

Everyone in this office is very professional yet personable.  There is little waiting time, coffee, tea and water are available .  You definitely feel like you're getting your money's worth when spending time with the doctors and techs as their attention is all on you and explanations are very clear.  I have never left with a question unanswered.< /Review>

<review>Office staff provided excellent directions and I got there in plenty of time. My dad was taken in immediately with no wait. I provided the woman at the check in desk with the original prescription with the referring doctor's name and address so there would be no confusion as to where the results would be sent. The doctor who wrote the order never received the results. I checked back with the clinic and was told that they sent the test results to another doctor because his name was in the chart. I pointed out their error and was told that because my dad's internist's name was in the chart they sent the results to him. Apparently, they did'nt even look at the prescription. I asked that they correct their error and I am hoping that they complied.<//review></record>

i found desert vein on the internet and was offered a free consult
my problem was with varicose veins that had returned fifty plus years after a major operation stripping both legs from ankle to thighs. my primary doctor did not have a vascular specialist on their in house network. Since i have a supplement policy i looked for a great place to help me. My first visit helped me to understand the issue with my legs needed to be fixed.  I came to their office each month for 6 months and I am thrilled with the results and highly recommend them to everyone who has varicose vein issues.<//text>

The staff is great.  Catherine is great.  However, when it comes to spider vein appointments which are many, I wonder why I have never seen the doctor.  If it was only to take a quick look at the progress of his patients.<//Text>

Dr. Trevor DerDerian is a very skilled and dedicated physician and surgeon. He takes the time to thoroughly explain the surgery he will perform and answer any questions you may have without making you feel rushed. He has a very calming effect on his patients and eases all anxieties. The staff is very friendly and the office is immaculate.

I would definitely recommend Dr. DerDerian to everyone who has vein/vascular concerns. He is a true professional.< /Text>

Dr. Yu and staff were fantastic. They were very helpful and thorough. Great follow-up and friendly staff.

Dr. Yu was able to take care of an issue for my mother that she had been having for a very long time and was overlooked by many other doctors. He has made such an improvement in her quality of life. The procedure reduced pain in her leg and she no longer uses a cane to walk. She is able to work in the garden and become involved in other activities that she has been unable to do for years. She can't thank him enough.</Review>

When I see a new doctor I note wait time, staff courtesy, facility cleanliness, compassion, time spent with the doctor, and his/her ability to answer questions simply and precisely. Dr. Sivia exceeded my expectations and therefore the 5-star review.<//review>

My experience with desert vein and vascular is very positive. I went in with pain in my ankle and the bottom of my foot that was excruciating. I left there after a 20-minute surgery done by radio waves and I left with no pain.  This is 7 months later and I still have no pain I am back to normal activities have had no problem at all. I recommended .them
very highly for any vein problem and if I have any problem in the future I will definitely go back.

<Name>Crazzy Cool< /Name><rate>1</rate><review>I responded to an ad for a "free" consultation for spider veins. The "person" led me to believe the procedure would be effortlessly solved. After, 5 mths of going in circles with appointments and being Made to REPEAT same TEST at different offices. Even speaking with ANYONE to solve issues was a hassle.  I was treated as though I did not matter. After, a derogatory comment about my insurance coverage it was clear as to why the staff clearly were rude/racist towards me. My primary doc had to intervene.  Magically,  I had an appointment with A DOCTOR at the vein office.  Dr. Yu was over 20 mins late. Within the first few minutes of speaking with him, I had no desire to allow him to preform any procedure for me. It is my opinion Vein and Vascular miss advertised leaving one to believe they were able to have the varicose veins corrected. In reality, they are PUSHING a new procedure " Venaseal" through insurance companies.  Ladies, if U want ur varicose veins care for than you have to pay out of pocket.

Report Them To Your Insurance Company
Everyone desires to be treated EQUAL.

This evaluation allows the patient to meet one of our board certified vascular specialists and discuss treatment options for their varicose or spider veins.\n\nWe accept most insurance plans and, if indicated under the strict guidelines set by the insurance plan, have any or all vein treatments covered.\n\nShould any procedure not be approved or covered by the insurance plan, then any and all costs will be discussed up front with the patient prior to treatment.\n\nVenaseal is the cutting edge technology available to treat varicose veins.  The board certified vascular surgeons at DVVI are the leaders of providing Venaseal in the country.  They have experience successfully treating over 5000 patients for vein disease.  Venaseal delivers better results with less discomfort to the patient, allowing them to return to their activities the same day, requires only a single injection of local anesthesia, and is usually performed in less than 30 minutes.  Medicare and many insurance companies now cover the Venaseal procedure when appropriate.\n\nWe treat our patients across the Coachella Valley like family.

Procedure didn't work yet they still charged my insurance thousands of dollars for a 45 minute procedure and then billed me for thousands more. Since it didn't work I appealed to them to write off my balance but they wouldn't. It you can go somewhere else i suggest you do. Even one of their staff told me doctor was hard to work for.</text>< pics>

Went in today to just look around and didn't have any idea of what we wanted. We tested all the firm beds and adjustable frames. The friendly sales associate Ryan Brown was so fun and informative that we ended up making our purchase today. We actually left there excited. Can't wait till our new bed arrives. Thanks Ryan and Christopher you guys make a great team I would highly recommend you to our friends.< /text>

Vaughn, our Sales Manager, is just plan outstanding!! His knowledge of the industry is bar none. Knows tons, can relate, assesses the clients needs and makes great recommendations. He’s professional, polite and has great energy/personality! We got a great mattress solution at a great price (value) and earned our trust. Vaughn’s customer service was so awesome he even helped us jump our car as our battery unexpectedly died. Did I mention this was done 1/2hr after they closed and he didn’t even seemed bothered by it. Such a nice guy. Go see Vaughn today!<//review>

We had a fantastic shopping experience here! Vaughn took great care of us, answered all of our questions, and gave us time and space to make the best decision for our family. We ended up exchanging for a different mattress, and he made it a SUPER smooth process! Truly exceptional— ask for him!< /review>

<review>Went in not sure what brand or type I was going to get for my children’s bunk bed. I was met with a welcome from the mattress firm representative Vaughn, who was awesome. Vaughn was interested in what I needed and wasn’t pressuring me to buy which in my opinion was great because he actually was paying attention to what I wanted. I walked in with an interest to buy and walked out with 4 mattresses and the best part besides the customer service was it was all under my budget. Thank you Vaughn for your time and I look forward to buying my next mattress from you.< /review><Response>None< /Response><UserId.>108456801789767422599<//UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

<Review>Visited the store today, and let me tell you, it was the best mattress buying experience I have ever had. Vaughn greeted us with a smile as soon as we entered. He was very informative about the differences in mattresses and allowed us to talk among ourselves; without pressuring at any moment. He was exceptional and demonstrated top notch customer service. Great place, great variety and amazing workers. Highly recommend!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My girlfriend and I upgraded our full size bed to a cal king the other day! We initially went through in to just look at beds and get an idea of what we wanted but Ryan was awesome and found an amazing bed in our price range. Today we went to pick up the bed and box springs and the great customer service continued. He gave me plenty of time to pick up my items and did not rush us at all. Ryan was a great help both days we went in and made the experience quick and easy. He made sure we got all the help we needed and answered all of our questions. He made sure we left happy and even helped load our bed into our vehicle. He’s great! Make sure when you shop here, you ask for Ryan. He’ll make sure you leave happy with a new comfy bed.</Text>

<review>Best service EVER. I called 3 stores to buy a mattress and Ryan was the ONLY person to call me and figure out a way that I could use financing over the phone. I am home recovering fro Achilles heel surgery and it is super difficult to get around as I am on crutches now. He gave me the suoer discounted price as online special and saved me over$300. Best service ever and I have been in sales for over 40 years. They deserve 10 stars.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I was very pleased with my visit today at this store. I had planned to do some shopping around after I got prices etc. But my salesperson Christopher Gentilcore was so helpful and knowledgeable I ended up buying after he showed me many different beds I had to choose from. I especially appreciate his care and concern that I get the best mattress for me after having had many back surgeries. I definitely recommend this store with all the mattresses they have to chose from.Thanks Chris 😊<//Review>

<Review>Went to mattress firm to purchase a bed for my friends daughter and we met a great sales man by the name of Vaughn. We already knew what bed we wanted to purchase. Vaughn introduced him self and made us feel comfortable from the start. Very well mannered and has a great vibe. He gave us a unbelievable price that we couldn’t refuse so we purchased the mattress right away. We were very happy with our purchase. If your looking for a mattress go see Vaughn at the delta shores location. Hands down best sales person I ever met. Thank you Vaughn!!<//Review></record>

The employee that helped us out was Ryan. He was really friendly and made sure we were comfortable. He listened to our concerns and did his best to match us with the mattress that fit us best. Ryan also went out of his way to make sure that we got the best deal possible. The bed is also super comfortable and it is being deliver the same day. I highly recommend this store if you're looking for a new mattress for a good price.</Review>

We went in to check out Purple mattresses in person after researching it online. Ryan Brown helped us and was low-key, highly informed and had really good sales associate energy - not pushy but could easily answer all our questions with confidence. We found everything we were looking for in store and Ryan made it super easy to complete the financing. Can't wait for our new mattress and base to arrive tomorrow!</review>

<text>Me and my fiancé were just kind of in the area and bedroom shopping as we found a new place and we really didn’t think we were sold on getting something that day; however Ryan was the coolest salesperson ever. I LIVE for great customer service and Ryan exceeded it! Ryan was very generous to show us around and have us feel out the different types of mattresses there are. I haven’t done mattress shopping in years so I didn’t know what to expect. I was only there to look around and one small 30 minute trip ended up to be an hour with a sale. My fiancé and I kept going back and forth about dimensions of the bed vs tradition and newer models. Our room specifically wasn’t all that big so we wanted to stay within budget, fit our room,  but also pick something we liked. All at the end we chose the Purple bed in which Ryan was able to get us a great deal on! Ryan was great with informing us about material and how the beds worked as far as the traditional standard beds as well as the newer more tech-y models (Purple). We scheduled a date for delivery and was approved for financing and he made everything very simple and personable. Feels good to just talk to a salesperson professionally, but feel like a friend is really trying to help and assist us without giving too much push. That’s what I call great customer service. If I ever need anything again, I will definitely call Ryan. Very cool guy and very personable. 5/5!< /text>< pics>

My experience with Ryan @mattressfirmdetalshores was excellent. I was very satisfied with my new mattress and the price Ryan offered me was by far the best! Thank you so much Ryan for the help. I would definitely recommend this place for my friends and family.</text>

I highly suggest the willow brook if you are looking for a soft comfy pillow top bed. I give it 5 stars!!! Also make sure you see Ryan. He did a great job assisting me with that bed and two others for my kids!!!!< /Review>

<Review>I walked in the place was clean and quiet. Mr. Ryan Brown was a wonderful worker. He greeted me and helped me determine a good mattress for my children.  He respected the fact that I had a price range and didnt try to talk me into buying something higher. Great place and great price!<//Review></record>

My wife (Linda) and I (Ryan) were in need of a new bed. We decided to stop by the Mattress Firm here in Delta Shores to check it out. We were helped by an associate named Vaughn. He spoke to us about every aspect of the bed first which mattered a lot to ensure we got the exact option that would satisfy us. He walked us through the different mattress choices based on our preferences. He allowed us to test out each one with an adequate amount of time and eventually guided us to a Tempur-Pedic Pro Adapt Medium Hybrid bed including Ease adjustable base as well which is the one we chose in the end. Vaughn’s patience, guidance, decorum, and knowledge was a true pleasure to have during our visit. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience than what he provided us. People like him is the reason why sales get done and customers leave happy. Thank you for everything!< /text>

And have had nothing but disappointment

The staff at the other store which I won’t name
But it would be easy for you to figure it out
We’re just useless they had no knowledge of there products

I actually had to come in to your store (Mattress Firm )to ask questions about the bed I purchased from the other store

Anyway to make a long story short
I just wanted to say blessed you are to have such great and Knowledgeable Staff at your

Delta Shores location I’m kicking myself for not coming to you first keep up the good work

My husband and I purchased a bed earlier this year, though we really liked two mattress options. We went with a Purple mattress, but after six months I'm still not sleeping well on it. I called today with the details of the other mattress I wrote down and spoke with Damien who provided excellent customer service. He was helpful in explaining some of my options and I was able to purchase the other mattress over the phone with ease. I am also getting a new box spring which was part of the holiday sale. I'm very pleased with Damien and the service provided from this location. Highly recommended!</review>

< Review>
Let me start by writing this... I wish I could’ve worked w/Bill from the beginning, bottom line, hands down! I would’ve loved & definitely prefer Bill to receive whatever sales incentive received for selling me my Sealy Hybrid Premium Silver Chill Plush mattress. My second interaction with him & I’m very impressed & extremely pleased. His attentiveness & willingness to make sure I was happy & completely satisfied when I left the store today was truly outstanding! He took care of me and I really wanted to give him a hug for reaching out regarding my last review, but due to social distancing, I couldn’t! He’s amazing & his concern felt authentic... I appreciate you Bill 🤗. If you’re looking to buy a mattress from Mattress Firm, please see Bill Y. He is definitely that guy & he will take care of you! Please believe me, I wouldn’t lie.<//Review>

<Text>The second we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff who immediately helped us answer all our questions. Vaughn took care of all our needs and was able to go through the process of finding a mattress with us fast and efficiently. We had no idea what we wanted and within 20 minutes Vaughn was able to determine the type of bed technology we wanted within the price we wanted to spend. This was our first stop ! We thought shopping for a mattress would take forever but Vaughn made it a one quick stop deal and we are so grateful the stress of buying a new bed turned into this experience!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

If you're in the market for a new bed, Bill Young at Mattress Firm Delta Shores is definitely the man to talk to. For me, buying a new bed was a big, serious purchase. Bill is kind. He's been doing this a long time so he's extremely knowledgeable and the confidence he has in the products he's selling really put my mind at ease. If I could give it 10 stars I would. Purchase your next bed here, it will be a purchase you won't regret!<//review>

<review>My wife and I stopped by mattress firm on whim while doing some shopping in the area. Upon entering, a gentleman named Ryan was quick to greet us and make us feel welcome. Ryan listened to all our needs and provided us with great information without being overly pushy like other mattress shops we visited. After being very patient with my indecisiveness, Ryan worked with us on our budget and choice of mattress to give us a bed and base to meet our expectations and more! I wasn’t planning on buying at that moment, but Ryan from mattress firm is worth the visit for all your mattress needs. 10/10 experience.</review>< Pictures>

I came in the store and was instantly greeted by the staff. A rep names Vaughn assisted my husband and I as I explained I wanted to return the mattress I purchased a few months that ago as it was not comfortable. Vaughn looked me up and we went over my options and I found a bed I believe will suit my needs. Vaughn’s customer service was over the top! He was very professional and knowledgeable of the mattresses and explained my options and what would be the next steps. I will definitely be back if I need another mattress!!< /review>

He also went out his way on a completely different day to fix my delivery for a earlier date then the one I was given as he promised he would. I would definitely recommend anybody to do good business with this man. Thanks again</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Damien was quick and incredibly nice to talk to. I walked in having 3 mattresses in mind and he explained the difference of them and I got to feel the difference myself. There was no question that he was unsure about and explained everything perfectly. The other associates there were really nice too and we had a funny conversation. I definitely recommend this mattress firm.< /text>< user>

They were very knowledgeable of there products. Made me feel very comfortable and were very friendly. They also had me laughing the entire time.

Ordered a matress online, went into a store to checkout the feel of a similar one to one i purchased before delivery day. Ordered box springs in store and the lady was helpful. The men who delivered were great, kind, respectful of property and followed their company safety guidelines (per covid). Thanks!!</review>

Thank you to Katie for helping us find a mattress! This was our first time mattress shopping and we didn’t expect much. Katie is the best. She was super friendly, and knowledgeable about the mattresses and the products, seeing what works best for my husband and I. She made us feel comfortable, had us laughing and helped us find a good mattress for the best price! We live in north Sacramento but I would definitely come back/recommend this mattress firm because of Katie.</Text>

Was in the market for a bed and contacted my local mattress firm which is Delta shores spoke with a young lady by the name of Katie who was very sweet. only one customer allowed in the store at a time and it's by appointment only which I like with everything that's going on right now. Everything was wiped down before I laid on it after I got up off of it it was wiped down I liked it You have to wear a mask It keeps me safe and your employees safe. Katie was very knowledgeable very sweet .</Text>

<Text>Mattress Firm online is the worst.  The experience has been horrific.  They are so wanting to sell you things but when you get what you don’t want and have to exchange- they suddenly don’t have any one to speak to and then have all these extra fees to restock and remove the mattress which they fail to mention when purchasing it.  They’re follow through to fix things is so bad.  I would never recommend them unless you go to the store and work with Damien at the  Delta Shore store.  He’s such a great person with amazing customer service skills.  He helped resolve things and absolutely is the only reason will still purchased an amazing mattress.< /Text>< pictures>

Bill Young was very informative and was able to make a good deal for me. It's rare, but my shopping experience was more practical and cheaper than online shopping, trust me, I always do my research. This time human experience beat the online experience.<//review>

<review>My husband and I went in to the Delta Shores Mattress Firm today and were quickly greeted by Vaughn. He remembered us from a previous day that we were in just to gather information. Vaughn was helpful in showing us a variety of models that fit the feel we were looking for and gave us ample time to try each one while explaining the features and benefits. He was patient as we tried multiple mattresses and them re-tried them again even taking the time to adjust the base of each one to our perfect setting.
In the end, we liked the firmness of the Beautyrest Beyond, but also the conformity of the Tempur-pedic. Thus, Vaughn directed us to the Beyond Hybrid where we found love, but the price was more than we had planned on. There was Vaughn again to the rescue! He got us out the door for a total price within our budget for the mattress and head/foot adjustable Sealy base!
No more back pains and tossing and turning from over heating for us! This mattress and base keeps us cool and comfortable all night.
Thank you again Vaughn!<//review><gmapID>0x809acefd468552eb:0xb5ab086c6f366c13<//gmapID></record>

I am so impressed with the customer service and the quality of the products I purchased from Mattress Firm at Delta Shores. Michael was a great sales representative to work with. I am a first time mattress buyer and have spent my whole life sleeping on hand me down mattresses so I really didn't know what I wanted or needed. Michael took the time to find what firmness level works for me and educate me on mattresses in general. I did not feel pressured and felt like he tailored the deal to my needs and budget. I was offered some incredible pricing that was well worth the investment. FYI, adjustable bases are so worth it! Even in the middle of moving, Michael was able to work around that to smoothly get me a new mattress. Thank you for the great service. I will definitely be recommending this company and location to people I know!<//text>

Excellent customer service!  Katie Foster was great!!  She is extremely knowledgeable about Mattress Firms products and she wasn’t trying to up-sell products I didn’t need like some places do.  She was able to help me with exactly what I needed.  I would highly recommend this place!!!<//Review>

Awesome job, Bill! Thanks for the great deal on the mattress package. Had no intentions on getting anything except to just look around but Bill offered us something we couldn't refuse. The no credit check made the process extra fast and easy. Oh, it was a great way to spend Valentine's Day</Review>

Damien P. was a solid sales professional and hooked me up with the best deal in town (believe me, I looked). I have a S&F Rockwell Luxury Firm W/ Eurotop and the EASE 3.0 adjustable base arriving in a few days and I'm excited to finally be sleeping like an adult should.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I went the Mattress Firm last weekend to shop around for a king mattress. Michael greeted me as I entered the store and immediately began to assist in my shopping experience. He started whipping out different mattresses for my daughter and I to try and even gave us pillows for the whole effect. I received a phone call from a relative and had to leave the store but I told Michael that I would return later in the evening. When I returned, he picked right back up where we left off. He was able to give me an amazing deal that included a speedy delivery of my foam mattress! I am extremely happy with the mattress selection as well as the customer service that I received last weekend and today (I went back to get mattress protectors). Thank you so much Michael!!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

I had been looking at getting a purple mattress for a few months now but wasn’t sure if it was worth it. I got in contact with Katie Foster out of the delta shores store and she answered all the  questions I had. She was very informative and personable and was able to help me start the process from home.< /Text>

Shoutout to Michael! Gave me a great deal I couldn’t resist. It was easy and fast would recommend this place to anyone looking to upgrade their old mattress. We’ve had our mattress for 10+ years it was time and he threw in a frame.<//Review>

Our sales associate Michael P, did a fantabulous job! We had a certain mattress picked out that they apparently stopped carrying, and he kindly redirected us to a new one almost identical that was still in our price range! He was kind, caring, and considerate and didn’t try to up-sale us things we couldn’t afford! Overall amazing first experience at Mattress Firm!<//Text>

Open by appointment, helped me find a new bed with kind service. I'll be well now. :)

The price markup for haggling is absurd, though. Managed to spend just under 25% of the prices that they marked their mattress at and yet I still feel like I overpaid. I understand that furniture stores markup their items, but more than 400%? Ew. The staff was kind, but the company itself is one I will not be dealing with for future purchases.</text>

Bill was super helpful and made my shopping experience very simple.
Purchased a Tempurpedic and he got me 60 months interest free financing and I have the best sleep ever!
Go see Bill for a thorough sleep needs assessment!</Review>

We should have done this months ago, but we LOVE our mattress. We got a great deal and our salesman Julio was AWESOME. He honestly could have not given us a better deal. We left happy and fulfilled. And the mattress for sure is as good as he said it would be. That matters a lot. Julio was honest and open to pricing and the types of mattresses that was presented to us. Thank you!</text>

We had the pleasure of working with Melissa in getting our new mattress ordered and delivered TOMORROW. Freakin tomorrow. How convenient. She was very personable and knowledgeable in all things mattress (like I learned stuff about my muscle system and sleeping that I had no idea about!)
All around an amazing experience. Thanks Melissa :)< /Text>

I was shopping around town for the best and cheapest mattress. I went to another location in Elk Grove and the same exact mattress cost so much more & we were told that every store would be the same price. But since my brother and my aunt previously bought from the Delta Shores location, I still wanted to check it out. And I’m so glad that I did. I’m so excited to get my new mattress to help improve my back pain. S/O to Mike for such a great service!<//Text>

We decided to finally purchase a new bed, so we returned to the same store that we made a purchase at a few months ago for our parents. Delta Shores, I had so many questions about a mattress, also they tell you so much information & most of it was always too much for me. I would always just walk out feeling confused & not making a purchase. Today I told my husband let’s go look, so we walked in Juan greeted us, I told him that I wanted to be able to tell him what we were looking for in a mattress, like I’m a side sleeper, plus I suffer from acid reflux & I wanted an adjustable frame (medium) I like pillow top as well. I explained that I wanted all.that made a difference in sleeping well, all night, Juan was knowledgeable, professional he wasn’t rushing us or forcing a purchase. So we made a purchase, we are happy & I’d come back to this same store and refer our friends & family.
Thank you so much, I’m super excited!!!</Review>

I ending up buying from him even though it was not my intention when I came in because the deal was great and he was just an awesome rep. I had gone to other stores and was treating like I was just a sale and they did not really care about my needs unless it was in the higher end mattresses.

Salesman, Tyler he's a good person and he helped me find a mattress.  I was just browsing and he was able to explain which one was good for my body type and sleeping position. I ended up buying a very nice Beauty rest and they gave me a free adjustable bed to make it feel even better.< /review>

I visited the Delta Shores Mattress Firm for a firm California King mattress. Ryan was very helpful in showing me all the firm mattress options. I really liked one mattress that was out of my price range and he was able to find the same one for me at a discounted price, about 50% off!< /text>

My wife dragged me out shopping to finally look at a new mattress and I couldn’t have been more surprised with how well the experience turned out. Michael came over with a friendly smile and quickly determined the best mattress for us. He had expert knowledge and provided a pressure free experience, like how my back is going to feel now. I would highly recommend Michael and this mattress firm to all of my family and friends.

Excellent customer service! I was only going to look around at mattresses, but then I met a kind sales representative named Mike. He eased me into the selection process of mattresses, allowing me to take my time to test out each mattress of my preferred mattress. There was genuinely no pressure at all whatsoever, so I decided to make a call and  actually purchase a mattress. Needless to say, if you ever meet Mike, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

This store is brand new, clean and very comfortable. Our salesman, Ryan, was amazing and educated us on so many mattress options. It had been 15 years since we bought a new mattress, and we are in love with our new selection. Ryan and team made sure to have it delivered timely, and I would definitely recommend Ryan and the Delta Shore Mattress Firm team for your next mattress purchase.</text>

<Review>This is seriously the only place to get a top quality mattress for a great price. I stumbled in on memorial day weekend knowing NOTHING about mattress shopping and Rennie totally took care of me and made sure I walked away feeling confident in my purchase. AND, better yet, they have yummy snacks!😀

UPDATE: I had to leave another review for Tyler, he is AWESOME and really knows how to make sure that concerned customers walk away feeling happy. I was having restless nights on our new mattress and he helped me find a solution and didnt make me cough up extra $$.<//Review>< Pics>

Vaughn was absolutely amazing!! My significant other and I came in 20-30 minutes before closing time (we were desperate) and I’ve never met more of an amazing salesman. Made us feel welcome as if the day wasn’t already over. 100 stars if I could. He took care of everything, answered all questions, and was completely patient considering how late it was. He explained everything to the best of his ability and was soooooooo nice. We ended up ordering the bed we wanted, among packages, and he saved us a ton of money. Super sweet and genuine, he was wonderful overall. Thank you, Vaughn!<//Review>

<Review>This was our first time here at Mattress frim at Delta shore. Our sale person Ryan was very helpful and was very knowledgeable. Ryan provide great information about the purple mattress that we were looking into and also showed us other mattress that was similar in materials. There was no pressure and they were very welcoming.
Great customer service and recommend giving mattress firm a chance if you are looking for a new mattress.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809acefd468552eb:0xb5ab086c6f366c13< /gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

Tyler truly went above and beyond for our family. We needed a comfortable mattress at an affordable price ASAP.  He introduced us the clearance program and We were able to save hundreds of dollars by participating and ending up going home with a steal. I would recommend them. Also check out their supreme sleep bundled came in handy for our new mattress 👌🏾!<//Text>

My husband and I had no idea what we were doing on our way in to the store but Tyler was beyond helpful. Not only is he a sleep expert but he'll also work within your budget.

My fiancé and I had a great experience at this location specifically. Tyler was very helpful and made sure we left with a smile. We are happy customers and will refer anyone that needs a mattress in the future.< /text>

If your searching for a new mattress your search ends here ! Stop right in and ask for Tyler. One thing about salesman they try to be pushy into purchasing but not here. The only pressure here is their  great prices and customer service Thank you Tyler.

When we first walked in we were instantly greeted by Tyler, he provided outstanding customer service, he listen to what we wanted and helped us found our perfect mattress. First we didn’t know what we were getting ourselves into by purchasing what felt “comfortable” to us. Tyler explained to us  the more coils in the mattress a longer lasting mattress. You already know, the more comfortable it is the more pricer! but Tyler gave us an incredible price and service that can’t beat in town !

For any parents shopping together they have a cute little LEGO table to keep our little kiddos busy while mommy&daddy talk business that’s definitely a PLUS !<//Text>

Great Location, Beautiful Show Room.

My wife and I were in need of a new bed and having lunch at In & Out and decided to walk next door and check it out.

They had a wide selection of mattresses and Tyler was very knowledgeable and helpful in helping with narrowing down the selection of mattresses to the one that best fit our needs.

We came in to look, but with the interest free financing they offered and the sale they had going we ended up getting caught in Tyler’s web and made a purchase and we LOVE our new mattress!

We called to confirm the delivery and Ryan was very helpful in providing a detailed time slot on when the mattress would be delivered and took time to assist us even though we were not his customer, says a lot about the company and staff.

Will be back for our future purchases.

This was my 2nd experience purchasing a mattress and it was the easiest. Julio was not pushy and was very helpful and knowledgeable of the mattresses he showed us and everything went super smooth! Would definitely recommend stopping by if you are in need of a new mattress!</Text>

Tyler... We cannot thank you enough for helping us find the BEST mattress within our price range.

I highly recommend coming to see Tyler. He was patient, listened to our needs, was very considerate of our price range, and ultimately we left knowing that we got the king of all mattresses.

Customer service was great. Tyler is extremely personable and a great salesmen because we definitely left with more than we came for. Lol

I can’t wait to use my adjustable base with all of the bells and whistles!

We have hella kids. We will be back!<//review>

As soon as I walked in I felt like the salesperson was trying to push me out the door even though no one else was in the store. I came in to look around for a new mattress and see their collection but the salesman would not let me just browse to look around, I felt extremely offended the way I was treated in there and will not be returning.  I can’t believe a store that barely gets any traffic won’t allow customers to even browse mattresses without being escorted like a thief around the store. Extremely pushy. I don’t recommend this place to anyone.</Text>

Ok Ok Ok! My wife and I just came into the store at Delta stores just to browse and guess what! Yup, we walked out with the cadillacs of mattresses and the adjustable base with strobe lights, lol. Tyler was a big help very knowledgeable and funny. We will return to buy our kids mattresses from now on.  (We have 4 fyi)😁. Oh shoot, wait hold up! I cant forget Ryan! I think in order for you to work here you must have great customer service skills(duh) and have 200 hours of comedy stand up, because not only did Ryan help me out he was making me laugh as well. That's a start of a good relationship😂. Well long story short this is a GREAT place to buy your mattress.<//Review>

Came in looking to see if they had the purple mattress and there it was. A gentleman named Mike  Riddle came to us with a smile and helped us find our purple 3 . Found out he is related to Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) so that was amazing lol.</review>

(Translated by Google) Juan was very attentive since we entered, he received us very kindly and helped us by asking the right questions and that way we could make the best choice of mattresses as well as a mattress protection set we definitely recommend this shop and Juan especially as an advisor five stars to sleep aguuuuuuuuusto thanks Juan and if we need anything else for the future we know where we should return my name is Luis Hernández
