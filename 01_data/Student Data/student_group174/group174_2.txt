Can’t even explain how wonderful I felt after my facial.  I believe Yolanda was the one who did my facial. She explained everything she did and put on my face. She recommended items I should try on my face but I didn’t purchase because they were a bit too pricey.
The room I was taken into was very clean and well kept.  Had relaxing music playing and the room was dim. I had an appointment and didn’t have to wait to be seen. For it being my first time there, I had to fill out an online questionnaire about my skin and my health.
Definitely recommend it!!!<//text>

Currently in the Navy/Submarine Service stationed in Groton, CT. The racks on board are horrible, back is wrecked...yada yada yada. Anyways. got the chance to take some leave and come home. This place just opened up, being always in search of something new, I checked it out.

As soon as you walk in you're greeted by the very friendly receptionist. Ask what you're looking for in a massage, have you fill out a questionnaire to better understand your needs.

After you're done with the check-in you're guided to the spacious tranquility room. This place smells NEW! Theres cucumber water standing by also.

Now for the massage, best massage you will ever have! Jessica is incredible. She takes the time to get to know where your problem areas are, and works wonders on all your knots. Very professional. You won't be disappointed!<//Review>

< review>
Tl;dr - They cancelled my pregnant wife's birthday visit 2 hours before the appointment and didn't offer anything to make up for last minute cancellation.

Booked a pre-natal visit for my wife a week in advance. 2 hrs before the visit, they call her to cancel. Turns out the person doing the massage was not available due to health issues. That wasn't a big deal because hey life happens.

What was a big deal was that (1) we had to ask to see if we could get something to make up for the last minute cancellation. (2) They said they'd have to check to see if it's something they could do but not in a "we'd love to do this for you" kind of attitude but more in a "stop bugging about it, we'll let you know", attitude.

WTH?? How is it not already common protocol to offer something to make up when there's a last minute cancellation of service?? Wack. Also, when i asked to speak to a manager they so happened to be unavailable.<//review>

I really like this massage please I had two massages as a gift from a friend they were very relaxing. But not to satisfied until I try this new place wish is very close to me. The person that gave me the massage is Ray his massage was what my body needed he gave me a mixture of massage with stretches. I am a coach and workout at least 6 time a week I really don't take care of my body because I'm very lazy....., but I found my solution Ray! Wonderful for does who love to workout but dislike the trenching and rolling part.
Thank you Ray for the amazing massage and stretching that my body really needed.... 😁</review>

<resp>None<//resp><review>I went in to ask for a price, the lady in the front told me it was $80 so i scheduled an appointment and said i would leave with the pain gone and feeling better. after the session i felt the same. The pain was still there and i looked in the mirror and noticed my back still looked a bit crooked which i assumed would have gotten fixed after the session like they said. so i tell the person at the front that i feel the same and she says she is going to only charge half. then she charges me $74. i told her half of 80 isn't 74 and she tells me full price is $150. she lied so i would pay full price. i insisted that she told me $80 before the session but she lied to my face and told me she had said 150. i paid angry that i have been lied to. i looked on their website and full price was $74. so not only did the therapy not work, but the lady in front desk lied to my face over and over while my back was hurting.< /review>< user>

Very professional.  Followed a timely schedule.  They were all so flexible with making changes for us.  The quality of work is wonderful!  Cabinetry is top notch star mark.
Very prompt in returning calls and correcting any issues which were very small.  Attention to detail is great! Brett, aschley, Antonio, Nelson , Javier and everyone else involved was awesome!  Great contractors.  We appreciated Mary and John’s guidance in the planning process.  Their ideas really worked. Highly recommend RW! Saving up for the next project..<//text>

<review>After having shopped around. We just felt a sense of peace after we met with Eric as the designer, and had stopped in their Poway showroom. He was a lot of fun and very creative, with great ideas, that tied in with our ideas to make it all work. He worked with us and allowed us to stay with our design , and adding some great idea to our ideas along the way. Our meetings in his office were always great meetings. He really accomaded to our needs, and did not add things that we did not want in the design, keeping the cost in mind also. He was so easy to work with. He was easy to reach by email or phone, if we had a questions. So we knew we were of to a great start, with Remodel Works!!! He always had so much enthusiasm when we discussed our project with him. He explained the process, and the scheduling. Never pushed any idea or product on us. Our project manager was Greg. We have nothing but good to say about Greg also. If we had a question, he was there to answer the question, by text or phone. He puts the customer first and their needs, great listener. He was great with communicating with us throughout the whole project. He felt like a family member during the whole project.
As far as the kitchen, we just LOVE our kitchen so much!!!!!!The work that was done, was all done to our approval. If there was a concern about anything, it was attended too, as we really felt they put the customer first .
Those that were part of the whole process, all did a great job, and communicated well  with us. We could not have asked for a better job and experience with the Remodel Works team, especially Eric and Greg. Thank you, thank you!!!!!!< /review>< time>

<review>We shopped three different remodel companies and were most impressed with the quality, professionalism, timeframes, and value presented by Remodel Works.  They came through 100%.  Kate the designer and Brett the project manager were great.  My wife and I were very satisfied with the final outcome.  I would highly recommend them to anyone considering a kitchen remodel.  Thank you!</review>< pics>

<text>We are very pleased with the completion of our project, planned and executed by Remodel Works. With Mary and John working on the design, we could not have been happier. They both worked closely with us, considering our budget, wishes and needs and came up with a great design for the whole house remodel. We truly is appreciated the close communication with Mary up to the completion of the project.
Greg, the project manager, was also wonderful. He often went above and beyond in making us happy customers. We are very happy with the whole process of the project and the end result.</text>< username>

Working with Remodel Works Bath & Kitchen was a pleasure.  The designer Steven, helped us greatly in designing the concept I had in my head.  He paid attention to details that I did not even think about and the design rendering looked amazing.  When construction was complete it looked even better, specifically our custom kitchen cabinets are amazing I could not have gotten these anywhere else.  Our project manager Nick, helped construction go as smoothly as possible, and his crew Chris G., Jose, Chris Z, were very courteous and did quality work inside of my home.  There were some unforeseen problems, which they could have charged me, but they dealt with those problems free of charge.  This is not a company that will go after you on change orders, their focus is on quality and keeping you, the customer, happy.  I had a great experience working with Remodel Works Bath & Kitchen and will use them again in the future.</review>

Remodel Works did an amazing job with our kitchen remodel! Our designer, Steve, made some great improvements with the layout of the kitchen. He really listened to what we wanted and came up with a beautiful kitchen we love!  Nick was our project manager and did a wonderful job organizing the project. He managed every detail and made sure everything stayed on schedule. Overall, we are extremely happy with our new kitchen and would definitely recommend Remodel Works for anyone considering remodeling their home.<//text>

<Text>From the very beginning the experience with them was amazing. Kate was an awesome designer consultant who took us through the entire process. Lance Hawkins, our project manager, was great at keeping us up to date and ensuring the project moved smoothly. Brett Maguire was THE MAN who did most of the work in our new beautiful bathroom. Nicest man you’ll ever meet: professional, meticulous and detailed oriented, clean and organized, he literally transformed our bathroom. The other crews that came to do specific work like dry wall, tile and shower glass door were equally as professional and nice.</Text>< pics>

Suggestions:
Know your style. Use pictures from PInterest and hard copies, this gives designers an overview of your style.
Spend some detailed time in Remodel Works show room.
Go over your final plans in great detail, this is your most important step. Remodel Works will not start until you approve every detail. Changes in the middle of a project can be costly and impact your plans. The plans cover electric, paint, plumbing, counter tops, cabinets, tile, doors, appliance set-up areas, faucets, lighting. Don’t count on things you said verbally, check to see if your requests are in the plans as many things are going on during remodel planning. Other than small changes we stayed with our plans.
You pick your own major appliances and flooring which gives you price options, medium or higher end.
From beginning to end (seven weeks, which was exactly the Remodel Works estimate) they stayed on schedule. There are very busy days and some down days.
My remodel was extensive and included a large kitchen, family room with fireplace, bathroom, laundry room and office. Two designers Matthew and Eric arrived at my home and did a great assessment of the job. This was my fourth company who had all done in-house assessments. It was my family’s first large remodel. I was impressed with the designer’s experience and their pricing was one of the best of the four companies. We continued to work with Matthew on our ideas that I had collected pictures over several years. Matthew added many suggestions, including some cost savings with the fireplace that turned out fantastic. Matthew greatly enhanced my style and taste.  We then met with the project manager Jeff. He spent a great deal of time going through the project in immense detail. He made some very practical suggestions which enhanced the remodel foot print.
Highly recommend Remodel Works!< /Text>

<text>Remodel Works provided a high end product at a reasonable price.  Our design consultant, Steve Hellman was amazing to work with.  He listed to us and integrated all of our design ideas and concerns, while guiding us along, using his skills and expertise. Steve is detailed oriented which was crucial for our small kitchen in order to get every inch out of storage needs while freeing up circulation space for movement throughout the kitchen.

The showroom floor offered many styles and ideas for material selections.  We were able to put a pallet together quickly with Steve's guidance. The renderings and construction drawings were a tremendous help in visualizing the final product. Coming from an Architectural background, I was impressed with the quality, accuracy, and level of detail of the CAD files. Steve maintained contact during the construction phase and until project completion.

Lance Hawkins, our Sr Project Manager,  was extremely professional throughout the process and oversaw all vital phases of the schedule.  He checked in with us regularly to ensure our satisfaction and updated us on any progress or changes as needed.  He provided a  construction schedule that included daily activities and corresponding trades. Lance stuck to the schedule and completed our kitchen on the exact day as originally intended.  Absolutely unheard of for a kitchen remodel.

Some of the most important factors to us was the cleanliness, scheduling and organization of the day to day construction. The daily trades and subcontractors were all amazing people, respectful, and friendly.  Remodel Works maintains relationships with their workforce and contractors, thereby providing a professional service that can be counted on.  With two young children and a puppy in our house during this time, all workers completed a thorough cleanup on a daily basis.

All costs were included and defined up front.  Upon a few occasions, demolition revealed the need for additional scope requirements such as wall insulation, baseboard changes, and plumbing line alterations for which Remodel Works took care of with no additional charge.

We couldn't be happier with the overall experience through design and construction, and the final product speaks for itself.  Quality materials, professional service, and good people that looked out for our best interest.   Remodel Works will most certainly be our first call for our next project.   Thank you much!!!<//text>< Time>

<time>1592421176745</time><Text>RemodelWorks did an exceptional job with our kitchen, starting with our very first interaction! From the get-go, even in scheduling our consultation, they were accommodating of our work schedules and scheduling a designer to meet with us outside of their regular hours (other companies that we met with had us work around their schedules, which was challenging). Matt, our designer, won us over from that first meeting. Despite it being an evening consultation, Matt was very generous with his time, and he is so passionate about his work. He had wonderful ideas, really listened to what we were looking for, very prompt with his communication, patient with our questions, and continued to accommodate our work schedules for every meeting in the process. Lance and Jerry were amazing Project and Operations managers, so detail-oriented and going above and beyond every step of the way to make sure that we were happy with the work, keeping a constant line of communication open along the way, and coming up with creative solutions. Everything was so seamless and well-organized, the subcontractors were all fantastic, and the work was consistently ahead of schedule. The job was finished nearly 1 week early! They were so easy and fun to work with, and so diligent. This company's services are worth every penny, and we highly recommend them for your remodeling needs. We're so happy with our new kitchen, it was such a painless process all around, and we absolutely plan to have RemodelWorks complete our bathroom renovations next year!</Text>< username>

Remodel Works just completed remodeling both of our 30 year old bathrooms (one immediately after the other). They came out as good as we possibly could have hoped for. Work was completed on time, actually a couple of days sooner than scheduled. Any glitches along the way were minor and quickly remedied. All the Remodel Works Employees were outstanding and all the sub-contractors also did good work.

We would like to specifically acknowledge some of the Remodel Work Employees that we worked with the most; Aschley who was here by far the most days throughout the remodel. He got here every morning around 7:00 which is what we requested and he did great quality work. He was really top notch. Also want to mention Chris who did a great job, Matt who did an outstanding job with all aspects of the design, Project Manager Brett who was responsive to all our needs, easy to work with, and quick to return our phone calls, and all the other staff we dealt with throughout  the remodel process.

We went with Remodel Works because we were happy with their work when they remodeled our kitchen a couple of years ago and we are glad we did.<//Review>

I recently had a complete kitchen renovation performed by Remodel Works and I could not be happier. This included having a drop ceiling removed, plumbing, electrical, lighting, cabinets and counter top.

The original kitchen layout was very bizarre and left me very confused on which way to go for the remodel. Thankfully Eric Fassett was able to point me in the right direction. With his help we were able to convert my 70's dysfunctional kitchen into a well thought out design that doubled the usable area.

My project lead was Brett Maguire who did an outstanding job of managing the multiple trade’s workers who participated in the completion of my kitchen. I was kept abreast of material arrival, any changes in schedule and constant communications ensuring I was happy with the renovation. Brett made himself available anytime I had a question or concern, which amazingly happened very little.

The thought of contracting out a kitchen remodel had me fairly concerned, enough that I put it off for about 4 years. Thankfully, I had a family friend who had their kitchen done by Remodel Works and I was able to see the quality of their work. Thanks to the hard work of Brett and his ability to juggle multiple tasks at the same time I now have a beautiful kitchen.

If you are looking to have your kitchen remodeled I would highly recommend Remodel Works!<//review>

<text>This place was a little hidden, but once I found it I was pleasantly surprised. When I walked in for the first time, two words came into mind: organized and clean. The showroom was big, and they have many products on display. The showroom definitely allowed me to picture what my new bathroom would look like. The staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and seemed like very motivated individuals. I would highly recommend Remodel Works.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>In 2015 this company installed cabinetry in our kitchen, bar and 3 baths. The sales rep committed to things the company could not fulfill and by the time this was brought to light our remodel schedule would have come to a screeching halt had we not continued with them. I felt like we had been intentionally lied to in order to get the sale. Not only was the price misrepresented but the product. So with no choice unless we wanted to live in a construction zone for several more months we proceeded. Huge lack of communication by our sales rep continued throughout the job. Now we’ve lived with the cabinets for 4 years. Mind you there is just two of us, no rowdy kids or animals impacting the cabinetry. Several doors are falling off due to the screws stripping out from normal use. No one bothered to mention that the finish would be ruined by the microwave vent either. An important detail to mention when your designing your layout. We spent close to 50k. The low end cabinets I bought from Lowe’s years ago held up far better than these. Go somewhere else and save yourself the headache. So disappointing!

George, This is a real review. My sales rep Jen T. Our project lead was Royce, had it not been for him it would have been even worse. He caught a few huge mistakes of hers.

Everything inside the showroom was very clean and there were many different models and color schemes to look at.

The showroom was spacious and I enjoyed looking at how many different tiles I can choose from! I was able to grab the tiles to feel the texture and get ideas for kitchen and bathroom designs. I am looking forward to working with Remodel Works soon!< /text></record></dataset><record>

Remodel Works has just completed a remodel of our master bathroom and we couldn’t be happier.
From start to finish, their work has been outstanding and performed with a high degree of professionalism.  Right from the beginning, designer Matt Arpaci worked with us to plan the design to meet our needs and wishes, making helpful suggestions as we went along.  Once the work began, their craftsmen continually demonstrated their skills, beginning with Leo Alvarez who took great pains to make sure the demo and upfront construction work was done neatly and properly.  Don Beckham was a tireless, jack-of-all-trades throughout the remodel, performing carpentry, plumbing, electrical, cabinetry and always left the jobsite clean each evening.  Jerry Jones did excellent work installing a difficult 8 ft pocket door.  The finished quality of the tile and glass work is exceptional.  Finally, we can’t speak highly enough about our project manager, Brian Robbins.  Brian would visit the job every day to review progress and ensure that quality and schedule were being maintained.  He also was always available by phone to address questions or concerns.  It is obvious that Brian takes great pride in his work.  We definitely recommend Remodel Works to anyone looking for quality home remodeling.</Review>

From what I have seen they do beautiful work that is worth the money, speaking of which they give you a guaranteed budget that makes the entire process much less stressful!

We hired Remodel Works to renovate our 30+ year old bathroom.  I am a service contractor in a related industry and I have in the past cobbled together my own home remodeling projects. This time I decided to go with a turn key contractor and very happy that I did. It was a little more expensive than I could have arranged on my own, but the time and efficiency gained was worth every penny! And I believe the project was priced competitively. From design to final it went very well. The normal little glitches that always come up were handled in stride as would be expected from a professional outfit. We were given a schedule which was adhered to, in fact it was completed with a few days to spare! There was a small change order for dry rot repairs that were not known at the time of the estimate. After the job was finished and paid for a small warranty item manifested regarding a drain, which turned out not to be their responsibility but was cheerfully handled the same day with no additional charge!  I recommend Remodel Works whole heartedly.</text>

The day I walked into the Remodel Works showroom, I was in awe. They have tons of choices for all different tastes and budgets. I was really self-assured when I saw the wall full of Angie's list awards. Everyone I met was extremely friendly and helpful- they patiently worked with my lack of knowledge of remodeling and guided me through everything. Solid company through and through!</Text>

Staying with my budget was my biggest concern with the project I envisioned. Remodel Works is honest and straightforward about their prices. They give you the best materials at very reasonable prices, and have great budgeting options. I had a lot of doubts going into my bathroom remodel but the customer service at Remodel Works was absolutely incredible. The experience of their designers, salespeople, and installers was very impressive and I had a great time to working with their entire staff. I very much recommend going to their showroom first before making a decision on materials. These are the best designers in San Diego!< /Text>

Remodel Works makes a big deal about their Timeline Schedule.  Unfortunately, when a worker or a subcontractor does not show up for a few, or TEN appointments, that schedule is out the window and apparently there is nothing RW can do!  And they will not compensate you in any way because time delay is not covered in their contract.  So be watchful and be prepared for how much delay you can tolerate.</Text>< pictures>

I had two bathrooms remodeled at the same time. A Master Bathroom and a Guest Bathroom. The designer Laura was unorganized, unprofessional, and incapable of measuring our space appropriately. Lance the project manager that is in charge of all project managers was also unable to do a good job with measuring when he and Laura came to the house to assess the area. It was not until we signed paperwork and had received our cad models that  Lance and Martin (who was our assigned project manager) came to the house for a meeting to meet the project manager and set up a schedule.  When they were in the Master Bathroom they both realized our measurement were off by 12 inches on a wall. They then discussed with us that the design was going to have to be redone.  They also pointed out a few more things about the design, like the mirror size being too small and the lighting being inefficient and that we would need one more can light.  Then our Guest Bathroom was assessed and we found that the doors were all opening in the wrong direction per the cad model. After going back to the drawing board to fix our problems our Project Manager and Designer continued disagree over our bathroom and put us in the middle having to make decisions that are a designer and a project managers job. It took us reaching out to the owners daughter in law Bianca to get things done. Our new design and cabinet was much smaller than anticipated but we had no choice we had already purchased the appliances (a large tub).  We could not take the tub back at this time and get a smaller one because it had taken so long to get to this spot (3 months).  We finally had new knobs picked out and cabinet sizes changed and agreed to move forward.  Martin our project manager promised several times that everything would turn out great this was a good company.  I will have to disagree with this.  We started construction and it went downhill from there. We had trash in our garage for three weeks, and a trailer (not a dumpster) with trash in our front yard completely full for over three weeks. It was a mess. Then as the work started our contractor in our Master Bathroom did not even know the dimensions of the framework for the tub and built it too big.  The workers also decided to talk bad about me while my husband was in the other room and he over heard them and when they realized he was there, they felt bad.  This is just unprofessional. Then when our painter came on the second day he brought his 5 year old daughter with him to my house.  I was now a daycare giving her water and putting the TV on for her.  I called the project manager and he said he would come to the house but he did not. This was a big problem we had throughout the project our project manager came every 3 days not checking on the work and then complaining when work was not being done efficiently. The tile workers would show up at 10 and leave at 2 with an hour lunch.  The project manager could not understand why our job was a week behind schedule. The downstairs bathroom also had problems.  The shower pan was ordered by the designer the wrong size. They had to move a wall to accommodate the pan size. We ended up with a swinging shower door which hit the wall because it had a towel bar on the outside.  If we kept this design our glass door would eventually crack. The company was not happy about this and tried to blame us.  After waiting  3 weeks, we finally got a sliding door. The only thing that is not fixed was a leaking hand held shower head. They say it is a faulty part but they have never checked it out they are assuming this without evidence.  I ordered a new part from the company and they still won't replace it or check to see if it needs replacing.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.  They are not worth the headache or the inability to simply measure correctly. As for the schedule they say they keep our two bathrooms were both behind two weeks.  Go elsewhere buyer beware.</review>< Pics>

Remodel Works designed and constructed our kitchen.  We couldn't be more pleased.  Their professional staff were a pleasure to work with.  The kitchen was done on time and the quality of work was excellent.  We would recommend them without hesitation.< /review>

Came here to get both my bathroom and kitchen remodeled and talk about a stress free experience. Remodeling can be disastrous sometimes but Remodel Works worked with me every step of the way and were so helpful. They helped make my dream home a reality, thanks remodel works!<//Review>

Remodel Works is as professional a home improvement company can get. The process of walking me through remodeling our kitchen was phenomenal.  A little bit more expensive than other quotes, but worth it at the end.< /Text>

My place in La Jolla, Ca really got a makeover from Remodel Works!  These guys came into my house and treated it as it was their own.  They walked in with their clean uniforms and a strategic plan of attack.  And boy did they stick by that plan, not only did they finish the job perfectly on schedule, they also did not go over budget.  Going over the budget was my fear going into this remodel project, but Remodel Works stuck to their word.

Now I can enjoy my home to the fullest and be able to have everything I have been waiting to take care for the last five years!  I would highly recommend their services, they may be a few bucks more than some, but trust me it is worth it!< /Text>

Recently finished 2nd bathroom remodel with Remodel Works and things turned out just as perfect as the first!  Every detail was well thought out and meticulously executed.  The entire process couldn't have been easier.  Kudos to Mary Jennings for being so patient and open to helping us design, re-design, and re-re-design, etc...  until we were completely happy with the plans.  The installs went great thanks to the awesome team of expert craftsmen.  Nick Dohrmann did such a fantastic job overseeing the first project, that we requested him to lead the 2nd project- which went even better than the first and finished ahead of schedule.  We absolutely love our newly remodeled bathrooms!<//Review>

I just have the greatest things to say about Remodel Works. The second I came through the door I was warmly greeted and was then introduced to a designer. My designer listened to all of my ideas in my very extensive kitchen remodel. I brought in photos I gathered from Pinterest and Houzz and from there my dream kitchen was coming true. I was then introduced to a Project Manager who oversaw the demolition and building process. The technicians working on my kitchen were prompt, and very careful with my home. They protected the work area and began working. I have read horror stories of how remodels go bad, but not mine. I enjoyed seeing my kitchen go through the many building stages. In the end it was a painless process. After the dust settled I got to enjoy my dream kitchen by hosting a party and having several get together's. Everyone asks who remodeled my kitchen every time they come over and see if for themselves. This company stands by their word and even better they stayed within my budget. I just love them and will recommend them to everyone!<//review>

As my wife and I started this journey of a complete kitchen remodel, we contacted home advisors. We had other contractors come and give us estimates, but they didn’t really seem interested.

But when Guy Borestein of Treeium came to the house with his estimate and ideas we knew immediately that Treeium was the right company. He was very professional and extremely easy to work with, and he listened to our ideas and concerns of how we wanted the kitchen of the future to look like.

We also wanted to commend Michelle Lueras and Lisa Brazil for their help with appointments and keeping us in touch with Guy, kudos to them.

Guy gave us an estimated time for the project and he was right on with the completion time.

When appointments were made at each stage of the project that group of specialists were on time and very professional.

When small oops would come up Guy would immediately offer an answer and take control of it right away. As the project was finishing up Guy made sure we were completely happy.

We would recommend Treeium and Guy Borestein to anyone who would be thinking of any types of remodeling project

Jijime is one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco. The ramen is exquisite, boneless chicken (honey butter) to die for, wide selection of good beers, amazing service, mellow atmosphere (they often play bossa nova in the restaurant, it's awesome), all perfect. I can’t imagine a better way to spend a rainy weeknight then cozying up with a warm Tonkotsu ramen from Jijime. The most solid of choices for a casual night out for dinner.</text>

Sssssoooo good!!! The food here was so tasty!  It was very filling as well with their good portion sizes.  The food came out hot and the spices were amazing from the second it hits your tongue to the long great after taste.  The prices are good and I would for sure bring a date here.< /Review>

Staff was attentive and checked on us often. They have a nice variety from fried items (super flavorful) and noodle soup (perfect for the kids). I wasn’t a huge fan of the quesadilla though but that’s just me. Everything else was delicious.<//text>

Wow great food! I don't miss the Japanese place that was here before at all. My friend and I ordered a bunch of stuff. Only no as good thing was there salmon ceviche, too much lemon/tartness... Fried chicken, ssam, corn cheese, fried squid, very delicious. Great service too.< /text>

< Review>
I really wanted to try this place since I saw their great deals for sake. Inside is really cute and clean. It is a bit small, but not crowded. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the short ribs, okonomiyaki fries, two beef bibimbap, and the chicken jjim. Of all the dishes, the chicken jjim was our favorite. The chicken and noodles were super tasty. The sauce went well with the bibimbap. I loved the fries and would highly recommend those for an appetizer. The short ribs were a great deal too. I think one downside was that there were no sides/banchan, but that's okay!

I loved this place and definitely plan to visit again soon. They have a great happy hour discount on sake. Their menu is pretty extensive and have a great selection of small plates. They're also doing take out for quarantine!</Review>

<Text>First of all, I was unhappy that I couldn’t make reservations, and the paper sign-in sheet at the establishment is inefficient. There is no room to stand, as the facility is small, so we had to wait outside, but then we didn’t receive notification that a table was available, so we had to ask again for one. After ordering, it took a while for the food to arrive, likely due to the small number of staff. The food itself was underwhelming, as it did not have much flavour without the sauce. The place is attractive and has a nice atmosphere, but overall, my expectations were not met.<//Text>< Pictures>

It's been awhile since I gave a 5 star review but this little hidden gem sure deserved it. I saw this fairly new place a week ago while running errands and stopped by for lunch with a friend today.
Since the menu classified the starters as tapas, we were going to order a few and then share a ramen or a sizzling bibimbab. The tapas were large in portions and we couldn't even finish the 4 we order. We thought we were done till they brought out the dessert menu.

Seafood Jeon $6.50
Korean savory pancake with mixed seafood
5* This was one of the best dishes, 2 small pancakes perfectly cooked. Crispy and tender at the same time.

Boneless Fried Chicken (spicy or soy garlic) $7.50
Bite size Korean style crispy boneless chicken with your choice of flavor
5* Another hit, chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfectly seasoned.

Popcorn Salmon $6
Bite size fried salmon with spicy
4* The salmon was just slightly overcooked for my liking but still divine.

Corn Cheese $6
Corn with creamy sauce and cheese on sizzling pan
3* This was average, nothing spectacular. Next time we will order the slicked beef salad instead.

I forgot to take a picture of the dessert, the Mango Panna Cotta was definetly a nice touch to end a delicious meal. I gave this restaurant 5 stars because the waitstaff was excellent. Great service with a smile!< /Text>

Spicy pork 👌 Fast service, and clean!  The spicy pork bowl was excellent.  I will try ramen next. I'm sure it's also great. Great Korean menu, spicy of course.  I highly recommend Jijime!</Review>

<Text>My husband and I came in here after just walking around the area looking for someplace to eat. first we visited Bluefin to only find out that they open at 5 p.m. so that was a bummer, then we went to Gordo's and discovered that they only had meat for their burritos so that was a no-go. (We are pescatarian-vegan.)
Then we happen to walk across the street from Gordo's just a few feet from the stop light, and stumbled onto Jijime.

What really grabbed us was the happy hour! visit their Instagram for pics of their food!!!! Tell me to my face that food dont look good, and ill tell you, you a muhfuh lie😂!!!!!!
the happy hour menu, I mean just for the sake and the beer alone I was in static shock. Then we looked at their tapas menu; It was everything we could ask for!
I mean everything we were able to have, delicious sake wine beer cocktails and small-plates that my husband and I were able to share at a very very very reasonable rate.

My husband and I are native San Franciscans! this is what we live for, in our city, to find those hidden gems and this is a city hidden Gem. If you want some happy hour eats from 3 to 6 p.m. please come here and see Hannah shout out to you Hannah because you were very sweet and you served us very well and we were very pleased, you, the cooks, and the food are the reason we are coming back!
PSA: to the vegans of San Francisco. Look no more they have a vegan and vegetarian option for their bebambib 😱. Your Welcome 😏.
Now I am going to show you below a before pic and there is no after pic because, in the words of my husband,

"WE TOOK THAT DOWN!!!"

And shout out to the cooks! They threw down! I feel so good after eating their food. The freshness! The ambiance. It was cozy and modern and quaint! Definitely will become a regular!!!!
See Ya'll Soon!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Maybe I shouldn't get a ramen at a Korean fusion place? The broth and ramen are good, although nothing spectacular. But the pork is dry and plain.

<review>Jijime's Korean - Asian fusion - Ramen flavors and textures are not for me. The Black Garlic Ramen $12.99 was sandy/gritty from the black garlic. It felt like I was eating bits of charcoal in most of my bites. It was bitter and off-putting for me. I thought I would like it because I enjoy garlic and black garlic and lots of reviews mentioned liking the dish.

I didn't like the flavor of the crispy fried seaweed roll. The spicy boneless chicken was soggy. The popcorn potstickers were okay.< /review><rate>3< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Sizzling Bibimbap ingredients were very underwhelming. Big slices of lettuce and bell peppers. Tryout plates/bowls options instead. Had the ramen with housemade garlic oil. Broth was good. The ramen is comparable to ramen used in instant ramen. Underwhelming.</Text>

Great Korean-style Bibimbap, chicken jijimen-style rice, and Japanese ramen with reasonable price!< /review>

<review>Very good and reliably made Korean food: we had the fried rice and the Kimchi stew. The Kimchi stew was a bit salty, but not bad overall. The fried rice was very good. Great vibe, good music, quite popular (the restaurant was well booked for our evening of eating).< /review>< pictures>

The concept is excellent. I’ve always wished I could get small plates of Korean food. And even the flavors here are great. The problem is it tastes like too many dishes are pre-made rather than freshly made. So, fried things aren’t crispy enough, the pancake was a bit soggy and not hot enough. And I could see the guy behind the bar microwaving things. I’d love to see them modify their food prep so I could enjoy this place and give it a better rating.< /review>

We had a wonderful lunch of  Bibimbup, one vegi and one bulgogi. Both were excellent.  The place is nice and welcoming.  And not less important- not expensive.< /review>

Very cute Korean Fusion place with a variety of Korean inspired and other Asian dishes. Not a BBQ place with banchan side dishes but tasty choices nonetheless. Kind of dark inside, with trendy decor. Good selection of beer. Waiter was super sweet and pretty attentive despite being the only server. Kimchi is very tasty but quite spicy, can't beat the price at $1.<//Text>

I wanted to try the katsu-don but when I asked the waitress about it she said they could not make it that evening...so I decided to order the bulgogi bowl and some okonomiyaki fries.

I didn't expect the okonomiyaki fries ($6) to be good but actually they were excellent. The fries had a McDonald's like texture but gourmet with kewpie mayo and katsu sauce finished with bonito flakes on top. Excellent.

Then the bulgogi bowl ($12.95) appeared. This bowl was a sad bulgogi bowl with disappointing small slices of meat that tasted like every Korean AYCE BBQ place I've ever been to. There was tons of green salad (with no dressing) and rice that filled the whole bowl probably at least 80% of the bowl with some clear noodles.

I would much rather pay more and have good bulgogi than pay less and have a disappointing experience. The bulgogi marinade was also super sweet, acid reflux inducing...overall just not good. I would not order it again.

The ambiance is nice here and its a good place to go with friends and maybe order some tapas, but if you really love Korean food you might find yourself disappointed at Jijime.<//Review>< pictures>

<Resp>None< /Resp><rate>5<//rate><text>I have never seen a "soft opening" that was so smooth and excellent as Jijime's - they got everything right from the get-go:

- A varied menu, authentically Korean but fitting every possible palate
- Low prices, $5 for "Small Bites" (which are really fun), $10-14 for (big) entrées
- The place looks both elegant and homey, lighting, decor first-class, the music is set right, providing background, not interfering with conversations
- Service is exceptional, both genuinely friendly and responding to every need

In just a week, Jijime became a habit.

The only "however" is that this is not the kind of Korean restaurant where you get a dozen small dishes to start with. For that, go to Han Il Kwan, two blocks away from Jijime, at 19th and Balboa.<//text><userid>106506772434153322196<//userid><user_name>Janos Gereben</user_name>< Pictures>

So being new to the area, and seeing how this  is the nearest food store to home I decided go shopping here. The place was a mess! Old produce soon made me realize why the parking lot was empty. After a few months I received a store ad. One day as I drove by I noticed the outside of the store looked much better since I had last shopped here. Stupid me decided to give it a second try. Big mistake!! Although it appears to look much better,, produce wise,, the frozen and packaged foods are either EXPIRED or close to expiring. Disgusting!! Not sure how this place is still open.<//text>

Fresco Market is by far one of the most descent and fresh looking atmosphere of a Market for all to shop for their home goods if you ask me. ;) God bless as always you awesome Market one and only ^_^</Text>

Meat Dept. blasts aweful music. Meat looks old. Veggies are rarely ripe, or they look old. Overpriced items. Example, ice cream drumsticks. Look them up. Double the price of any other market and its the small pack.<//Review>

Very expired milk and old cottage cheese, the cashier didn't acknowledge me, instead she spoke to another customer across the store in Spanish. The floors are filthy, old food, time for the health department to close it down.</review>

The area has gone downhill, lots of homeless hang out here and the shopping center itself has little in stores to offer, also poorly lit parking lot at night, the km art in West covina also has bad lighting in the dark, can be scary to shop there.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) For my taste one of the supermarkets with very poor quality, some prices are doubled over other places.

Upon entering you realize a bad smell that comes from the meat department, cleanliness and order are very bad. Customer service very bad, you will rarely see someone to help you. The little service that butchers give you will make you go to any other place to buy before there.

Possibly next time I will give 2 stars if the cashier does not yawn while there are customers.

(Original)
Para mi gusto uno de los supermercados con muy mala calidad, algunos precios están al doble sobre otros lugares.

Al entrar te das cuenta de un mal olor que viene del departamento de carnes, la limpieza y el orden son muy pésimos. El servicio al cliente muy mal, raramente verás a alguien para ayudarte. El escaso servicio que te dan los carniceros te orillan a que vayas a cualquier otro sitio a comprar antes que ahí.

Posiblemente la próxima vez le de 2 estrellas si la cajera no bosteza mientras haya clientes.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

They not only have buffalo wings, salads, sandwiches and burgers, they  they are BIG burgers. And they also have calamari strips and/or steak. Better to drop in and decide for yourself. There's somethinger for everyone.<//Text>

Customer service was good, the tables were clean, and we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. It was exceptionally dark inside though, and the bathroom wasn't very clean. The wings tasted strange, and the fries were cold. The garlic fries that my girlfriend and I ordered had hardly any garlic.</Review>

The downside that I don't like about Shooters is they don't have a separate pan to make french fries and onion rings and anything that goes in the deep fryer that isn't attached to what they use for any type of fish so if you're allergic to fish don't get anything that's deep fried like french fries onion rings chicken strips Etc. It's very dangerous if you don't know and it wouldn't put them out to have a separate deep frying station that they don't use any fish products in.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Boneless wings were very greasy. The taste was overwhelmed with grease and oil. Had these been dryer, I assume they would have tasted amazing. Customer service was outstanding. Except I asked for ranch and got a huge surprise when it was blue cheese. 😐Mainly the reason I rated 3 stars. Would recommend this place to fellow people. Order a sandwich or burger, stay away from the wings.</Text>< resp>

My expectations of what this place was was busted as soon as I walked in. Patterson doesn't have a lot to offer for a happy hour grill and this place was a big let down. As soon as I walked I felt like this place wasn't even going to rise to the level of a Chili's and it wasn't even close. I went safe with a burger and tater tots, dump their burger. Meet was overcooked and boring. Tots came from a frozen bag, okay I get it, but at least make sure they are cooked through some where not. The servers were all nice and they made my order right after another attempt. Drive another 20 minutes to Tracy and look for another grill any other grill.<//Review>

I live in Patterson, I took my father-in-law to dinner to try out this restaurant for the 1st time.  We sat outside along with a couple of other customers and we made our order and also notice that the other customers around us were having issues with their order. When the food arrived it was only my father-in-law's food and as he politely waited for my food to arrive I told him to eat his food. When my tri-tip sandwich arrived, I noticed 4 thin slices of meat on the sandwich and the rest was lettuce, along with cold fries. I told the waitress and she took it to fix it. By the time it was returned to me my father in law finished his dinner and my sandwich had a few more pieces of meat on it. Plus it did not feel like it was fresh, more like placed in the microwave. As I got a box, my father in law paid the bill. I couldn't let him pay for the worst tri-tip sandwich I've ever had. So I asked for a refund for my meal that I did not eat. They did offer me another sandwich, but I declined their offer since they already had the chance to fix it.
I gave this place a 2nd & 3rd try after that experience, and still was not impressed with their overpriced food, which was not that great. I will not go back there again.
I would rather go to Apricot's BBQ in Patterson and pay a little more.< /review>

Great Cheesesteaks! Good service. Lots of big TV's for sports. If you get a Cheesesteak, they do have excellent marinara sauce if you want to make it a Philly.< /Text>

Came the first time cause I was craving wings and my daughter got a burger. I got boneless wings and they were excellent, but holy **** I had a couple bites of my daughter's burger, and it was outrageously good! Next time I came with both kids and I got the mushroom swiss burger, which was also outstanding. The wings are great, there's absolutely nothing wrong with them, but the burgers are sooooo juicy and delicious, it's going to be a struggle to order every time lol. The service has been nothing short of excellent as well. Very happy with Shooters!<//Review>< pics>

Had the opportunity to experience Shooters Wings & Things today for lunch and was enjoyed it.  What struck me most was they had a "Veggie Melt" sandwich...but then again...this is California...so...maybe it shouldn't have surprised me.  Regardless...I had the Veggie Melt sandwich and it was loaded w/ Avocado - num num!!  The only downside was..they only offered White bread (as Johnny Cockran would say - "If it's white it's ain't right.") or Rye bread (which is a form of white bread).

So...I would recommend Shooters.<//review>

True hours are 6-11 I think (maybe 6-10). It is in a convenient location for me, the gas is quite cheap, and the owner is quite nice. I just wish they were 24 hours sometimes.<//text>

<rate>3<//rate><review>I rated it a 3 cause the experience depends on the doctor that is there when you go. Some act like your just a number and don't really fix what hurts you specifically. Some will just give you very generic adjustments. But one of the doctors there will take time with you to adjust exactly what's hurting and even help you stretch and massage you if needed.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This place is a joke. They took a whole 2 seconds to "adjust" me. Ended up with herniated disc. Asked for refund, they said I needed a Dr note to get a refund. So neurologist gave me a note, took it to them, and they still havnt refunded my money. Don't go here. Dishonest business. Go somewhere that isn't just after your money and not assess your problem. Now I'm out over $200 for absolutely no service.</Review>

As a convenient, walk-in clinic, we do our best to establish proper expectations for everyone who arrives. For new patients, visits take longer (around 30 minutes) in order to conduct a proper consultation, exam, and adjustment in addition to initial paperwork. We need to take the time to give you the thorough care that you deserve.\n\nThis is why our policy dictates that new patients are not accepted within the hour before closing. We truly apologize that this process was not communicated to you effectively, and aim to make this right.\n\nPlease, email or call us to confirm the best way for management to contact you. We want to directly address this experience and would love the opportunity to give you the outstanding, convenient care that we are known for.\n\nBest in Health,\nThe Joint Chiropractic\u200b'}< /Response>

I’m not one to just go to any chiropractor but after my chiropractor (10+ yrs) was closed (he’s an hour away)  I had a horrible migraine I could not Ignore.  I thought I should get over my fear and check this place out. I was a walk in new patient but the process was quick and easy and I had my first adjustment with Dr. Gee. So glad I went in, he helped me with the migraine and my neck. I’ve been going for the past few weeks now and every time I come out feeling great. My neck and head is feeling so much better and I’m able to sleep much more comfortable now.  Also the pricing is very reasonable!</text>

Dr. Thomas is great, friendly and understanding.  He always makes sure that everything is taken care of, and I'm walking away feeling comfortable.  The office itself is always clean, and it's a peaceful atmosphere. If you ever thought about trying this place, come on by on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday; that's when Dr. Thomas is usually here!< /text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1566762347589<//Time><text>Dr.Duane is honestly a god send. Coming from someone who has sevier claustrophobic to the point that i cant stand being touched. He took the time to get to know me and my needs and informed me on why my pain was there and how to eliminate it. He never made me feel like a number or just a client i felt like i was going to see a friend everytime I went in for an adjustment. He went at my pace and never put me in an uncomfortable position. I highly suggest you come in and get an adjustment from Dr. Duane Thomas. Even if your scared i suggest going in with him to get educated tips on how to manage pain and discomfort. You wont be disappointed.<//text>< user_name>

<Review>Love Dr  John. I was seeing a chiropractor for 14 years and he was great.  He did adjustments, cupping,  laser,  ultrasound, massage, etc. and I loved him. He took his time and would tell he was more interested in his patients well being.  But then he retired. I started seeing other chiropractors but none were as good as the one I used to see in Arcadia. Then I decided to visit The Joint and met Dr. John.  OMG! He's even better than the Dr I was seeing in Arcadia  He just has the midas touch! It's like God has just gifted him with magic fingers. I don't need to be there for 1/2 hr, Dr John is just able to adjust me in minutes and I seriously feel like a new person. He's incredible!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c329f00e7e3187:0xa76f8bb52973ccc6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I used to frequent The Joint location in Lakewood, but have since moved to West Covina. I was a little hesitant at first to try out another location, but absolutely love the adjustments given by both doctors at this location. My wait time is always very reasonable and I get adjusted right away. If you live in West Covina, you should give them a try. The first adjustment is 19 bucks. They really do care about your well being and offer several payment options to fit your needs. To top it off, they're open until 7pm. during the week. I still have enough time to commute through traffic and get adjusted on my way home from work.< /Review>

Alright so I came here for a little over a year and this place doesn't do anything unless it's some acute pain.  If you have real back pain, then you have to address your weak muscles, which they will never tell you. Their goal is for you to keep coming back. Your body will never recover just by visiting the chiro, you have to put in some time and work. So stop wasting your money and do some research if you really care about your body and money.
Look up myodetox. Stay sharp.<//Review>

<review>I am a former soldier who loves martial arts, needless to say I have my sore and stiff moments. It had been a long time since I had an adjustment and I'd been hesitant to try any place really. Finally bit thw bullet and I feel so much better even from the first adjustment. The Joint in West Covina is super clean, the staff was very friendly and there was no wait time when I came in. Doc discussed my medical history throughly, then did his evaluation and gave me an adjustment. Finally he gave me his recommendation for continuing care.

The prices are already reasonable but they also have a military discount so veterans speak up. No appointments or insurance required. Over all great place, great experience. They will be seeing me again next week.</review>< Rating>

Family owned business very friendly and funny guy, the owner is really cool and eager to assist. Even bought us drinks while we waited. They have private credit loans available to make sure you get what you need. He made sure his technicians were working hard to get us out as soon possible. He was honest and straight up. After other shops tried to convince us we needed to replace all of our brakes and rotors. He told us exactly what percentage our brakes were and assured us we had plenty of time and life left to not have to burn more money in something not needed.< /Text>

<Text>I had a great experience with Northern Tire and Wheel. Mark was very knowledgeable and gave me a great deal on my 6" Pro Comp lift kit for my 2016 Ram 2500. I rate this place 5 stars. I am more than satisfied with my lift. Thank you Northern Tire and Wheels for making my experience a memorable one. I will definitely come back for wheels and tires in the near future. I recommend this place for your wheels, tires, lift or any truck accessories needs. All staff are professional and polite. I am a very satisfied customer!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Mark was very helpful. He didn't work on my particular application, however he went above and beyond in pointing me in the right direction. He even was willing to call the place to check if they were able to help me. 5 stars.</review>

<text>Northern Tire and Wheels recently did a lift, rims, and tire mod for my 2016 F150. The experience was very positive. Parts and work were as described by proprietor Mark. He was helpful with the part suggestions for the build and responsive in customer service.  The shop was clean and professional and I felt good about getting the work done there. Pricing was not cheapest but competitive based on my research, and I am willing to pay to get work done correct with good service. I will return to this business and would also recommend them if you are seeking a similar vehicle upgrades. Call them, they were good.</text><gmap_id>0x809053c2b8bdea1b:0x4275a687abc0a5f5<//gmap_id><Time>1497115138925</Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>102698350716346725192<//userid>< Response>

<Text>Got 4 brand new tires installed and wheel alignment and it feels like I'm riding on air! No pull to either side when I stop or drive. After they were installed got right on the freeway and such a quiet ride compared to my last tires. They worked with me and my budget, kept me informed throughout the installation and were real gentlemen. I would recommend this place to anyone. Just like my coworker recommended them to me and I'm more than happy he did! Thanks guys for the service and I will definitely come back when I need service again :)< /Text><response>{'time': 1454084522121, 'text': 'Thanks for bringing your vehicle to Northern Tire and Wheel, in Modesto, Ca.

Great service! They mounted up the tires I bought online with a fair price, and great service. Mark had some great suggestions for some suspension modifications, and obviously knows his stuff!< /Review>

<Review>Just going to start off with how nice the truck looked when I came to pick it up, talk about a shop that does clean work. On top of just the clean work, Mark has excellent customer service always updated me, sent me pictures of finish work, stayed at the shop several times just for me to have a late drop off and was 1 1/2 late to lick the truck up. Northern tire and wheel gave me that customer service that we don't really see anymore... I gave them five stars they deserve it
Integrity
Customer service
Excellent work
Thanks for making this experience enjoyable and easy

<text>9/1/2020 2 years later I went back with my 2017 Mustang Ecoboost and got some lowering springs installed again! If you want the job done right be prepared to spend a little money.

3/18/2018 I just took my 2013 Chevy Sonic LT to get some lowering springs installed and to also get an alignment done. I am very pleased with the result!<//text><rating>4<//rating>< Response>

<review>Went in for a price for a small inch lift on my truck, they went outside and just started criticizing my wheels saying they were too big, like who cares I paid for them and I didnt ask for your opinions. maybe because I didnt get them from them. Then they said it was going to be really expensive to get the lift. Frist of all I didnt ask if it was expensive,  and second I got the money (cash) . They weren't rude at all but if someone goes in asking for something you try to help as much as u can without criticizing what you have. Just saying. Definitely wont be spending my money there.< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>Because of improper installation and very poor workmanship, my air lift suspension for my Ford F150 came apart and ruined the air bladder after 5 months.  The manufacturer sent me one for free but when I first asked Mark Powell, owner of Northern Tire on Kansas Ave in Modesto, he said he had to charge me $100 for the bladder which was free and under a manufacturers warranty. The bolts that were holding the bladder to the mounting bracket were, according to the manufacturer, to be Loctite in and Northern did not use Loctite.  If you research Yelp and other areas like the California Bureau of Automotive Repair you will find out about the real Mark Powell and how he does business.

If you want good service at a very fair price, go to McCoy tire in Modesto.</Text>< user>

I took my car to Northern Tire & Wheel for a full rear brake job. I knew I needed new rotors and pads. The guys working there looked over my car and did the work as expected, at a reasonable price, without trying to upsell me on any other work.
The manager working the desk even gave me the remote, and I watched sportscenter while they worked on my vehicle.
Very friendly staff--felt like my buddies were working on my car. I will be back if/when I need more work done.<//review>

hey guys i just broke in here through the hole in the fence and it seems like a lovely establishment. honestly i could be more happy with the service because nobody called the cops on me. overall the whole place has quite a nice atmosphere and vibe to it. it seems like the kind of place that just keeps on going because it always has. no matter if there are turkeys on the free. or people breaking in through small holes in the fence. the birds are chirping, the golfers are golfing and everyone is happy. i now feel bad that i broke in here. everything is so nice.<//review>

Absolutely, da bomb. Me and my homies always hang at "the club". Lunch looking out over the greens, chatting with Jeeves about silver polish, knocking back a 40 on the 19th hole, what's not to like?< /text>

< review>
the dress code is pretty lame, nothing like a bunch of white people telling you how to dress, since when did we becoming such a communist country? the bathrooms aren't what i was expecting, only one works and the other one i tried to use wouldn't go down and i just had to leave my mess floating around like a lost puppy in the middle of winter, i did enjoy the peanuts scattered all around the floor, it was practically a minefield in there. it was very unpleasant seeing lots of white streaks on the counter tops that i believe was cocaine. things only got worse when i got out of the bathroom, immediately a old woman told me to go "fetch" her another mimosa, does everyone there just assume every latino there is a worker? overall i did enjoy my time there, lovely atmosphere,food was fantastic, the people on the golf course where a bit mean though, other than that i would give this a 7 out of 10. i do recommend!</review>

Not to be confused with the Claremont Resort, the golf club is an older establishment with Tudor styled buildings and a beautiful golf course as its back drop

The bar service was excellent under the circumstances of a very warm day for even Oakland standards

Food service for the reception was excellent as well as the salmon and filet mignon were cooked perfectly

A very lovely venue, it is a private members only club< /text>< Pics>

A favorite regular place to eat, always has fast kind service and consistently tasty food. The menu is very fairly priced. Thank you, Kebab Cafe for the many years of delicious food. I hope to eat your food for many years to come. Especially recommend the Falafel Burger and the Gyro. The halloumi is an tasty snack or side when you want something salty. The Turkish Coffee with cardamom will keep you alert :)< /text>

Wonderful food! Everytime I've been here, the food has been amazing. The staff is friendly. The portion sizes are great. One gyro is enough to fill anyone up.<//Review>

The staff that helped me was very friendly and made sure to answer my questions in a detailed manner. Was roughly a 20 min wait to get my food and I do have to say it was worth it. The atomic mushrooms were amazing. The gyro sandwich was amazing. My friend who accompanied me had high praise for the gyro burger. The only thing that caught me off guard were the skewers. Lamb skewer was good, however the chicken and beef skewers were kinda bland mostly tasting the same and we're not really improved by either sauces. Overall good place, would come back for more mushrooms and gyros</Text>

Always delicious food and very kind, and personalized service. I try to stop by every time I’m in the area. I’ve even taken the gyros all the way back home to SF so my husband could try them. Once I mentioned that’s what I was doing they wrapped the ingredients separately for me so nothing got soggy on the 5+ hour drive. A+<//text>

The gyros and fries are so addicting! They are currently offering curbside pickup during the pandemic and the customer service has been amazing as usual. They have buzzers and are sanitizing everything. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Humboldt.< /text>

After ordering over $60 in entrees for our dinner, there were a few items that were missing.I called thinking no big deal, they will replace or refund me. NOPE! They did NOT offer to replace or refund what was missing. They snapped and stated "they were busy", so we have to deal with it during "these times". Did not know that THIEVING was okay during these hard times. I will be revoking my business here, very sad.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great food and prices to match, definitely one of the better restaurants in Arcata. You can eat in or take it to go and they also have items you can buy and bake at home!  Great chicken burger for only 6$ and a cup of soup for 2.25.< /Text>

<Review>Paid over $30 for snack sized portions... DO NOT GO HERE. Not authentic, bland, and a rip-off on portions. I'm assuming all of the good reviews are people who are not familiar with this cuisine.  Will NEVER return.<//Review><time>1510539270250</time>< UserId.>

<review>Service is nice and the food is prepared in cases on display to see freshness. I like the transparency and options. The sauces were tasty and everything was hot and freshly cooked. Kebabs were perfectly grilled and falafals were not dry or too oily. I would definitely come back to try more</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x54d15a00f6e94c29:0x17fd570b2474b07< /GmapID></record>

The food is so delicious; it always makes the wait worth it. It's a great hole in the wall that more people should give love to, and makes a tasty meal into a memorable one that will want you to re-live over again.< /Review>

The Mediterranean chicken sandwich with pepper jack and spicy habanero sauce is so tasty! If you like what, try the habanero sauce in anything.</Text>

I've taken many people here for their first time and everyone has agreed its amazing. The Gyros are awesome and the French fries are the best around.</text>< Pictures>

<name>Red “Would” Forrest<//name><Review>By FAR, the best affordable burger in Northern California - in fact, I believe they have the best burger for the price of anywhere I've ever had. Yes, the Mediterranean cuisine is great - but so is everything else they do. Really. If you are in the area and are looking for a cheap meal, you really can't go wrong here no matter what you choose from the menu.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Good middle eastern food. Small place with counter and table seating. It used to be you had to order at the counter but they now have table service. I love the Gyros.< /Review>

Only 4 stars given just because the chairs & table are a little uncomfortable, dimness made it hard to read the menu.
Otherwise, besides being the only Mediterranean restaurant around, definitely the best with quite reasonable prices.</Text>< Resp>

Small place with not a lot of seating, but one can usually find a spot. Friendly staff, great service, and they are happy to explain menu items that you may be unfamiliar with.  Everything is super fresh.  Great assortment of Mediterranean dishes, falafel, kebabs, etc.  If you like spicy heat, try either if their freshly made sauces, delish.  Working our way through their menu has been a pleasure.<//text>< Pictures>

The place is very clean, decorative, and overall  appealing. The waiter was polite and very reliable. And the food was amazing! I ordered lamb kebabs. And there's something I'd like to point out. I once had lamb chops and nearly gagged from the fat on them. However, the fat on the lamb kebabs was really Good! Overall, this is a great place to eat.</review>

Not bad, the meat was delicious. Wish they had more options for gluten-free.  Even the rice had wheat, but I appreciate them being honest.  The ladies were a bit rushed, but nice and professional.  Would go back.<//Text>

Not life-changing, but pretty damn good. We stopped here for dinner based on a recommendation from our Airbnb hosts. Much better food for the price than any other place we've tried in the area. Fresh ingredients, well seasoned, and great donner meat. The menu also has a great variety of smaller and side dishes that allow you to get exactly what you want. Great service too.<//review>

Really enjoyed our meal here. As out of towners driving along the coast, Kebab Cafe truly hit the spot. The felafel is one of the better ones I've had (crispy, not oily, not super dense, and very well seasoned) and our table enjoyed our meals. Service is excellent and and friendly. If you're in the area and fast food just isn't your thing, grab a gyro or felafel from Kebab Cafe.</Text>

This and Nooner are the only Mediterranean food places in the county I have been to! Love the Gyros and Kofte. Service is quick and friendly, everything cooked fresh to order and you can see it all in the see through fridge display. Falafels are super yummy and I like the Tziki sauce. Been going here for years and their consistancy has kept me coming back!<//Review>

Best cheap restaurant in the county.  Really.  Everything on the menu is exceptional - try the kebabs or a burger.  My favorite cheap burger in Humboldt.  Staff is top notch.</Review>

I used to come here all the time when I lived across the street. Just came here with my husband and the service and food were a pretty big disappointment. We came in about 10
Minutes before closing and ordered a dinner plate and some skewers. We waited for about half an hour and when they called our order I was surprised to see that it was packaged to go. A bunch of people who ordered after us got their food and finished eating by the time they called our order.  When ordering I wasn't told that they weren't taking dine in orders anymore. I told the cashier we were still finishing our beers and our order was for here. They told me they were closed and they weren't serving dine in orders anymore. The food was cold and we only got half of our order. We had to wait longer for the other half. I was really disappointed because this place used to be great.</review>

I have always loved this place. I can't recommend the falafel burger w/cheese enough! French fries are okay, but the fried cheese is where it's at. It can take a little bit to get your food, but it's worth the wait. I usually get my order to go because there is limited seating. Try the falafel cheese burger.<//review>

I just moved in around the corner from this place and I've been there four times in a week. My go to is the chicken sandwich with Tzatziki sauce. It's got a great blend of flavor and consistency. The falafel and skewers are great too. If you're driving past Guintoli going north or south on the 101, stop here. Call in your order if you're in a hurry because there is usually a wait. The employees are also top notch.<//text>

Blah.....the food is very dry, and salty.  I was here on business, and didn't know the area so it was one of the first restaurants I found.  First off, the building is super tiny with enough room to maybe fit 6 people.  There were a lot of people standing around waiting on their food.  I didn't care for it at all, and I do enjoy middle eastern cuisine.<//text>

<Text>We're on our way from LA to Canada, and wanted something tasty and healthy after fast-food road junk had us all feeling icky. My wife found this place on Yelp, and it was near our hotel, so we gave it a go to take back to our hotel. It was VERY good. We're used to Baghdadi Mediterranean cuisine, and though this was different (Cypriot?), it was wonderful. The falafel sandwich was brilliant, and had a surprisingly little spicy kick to it. Very, very tasty. The hummus was ok, not great, not bad, but tasty enough. The prices were also just a tad, tad bit higher than we expected, but again, we really enjoyed the meal.</Text><gmapID>0x54d15a00f6e94c29:0x17fd570b2474b07</gmapID>< UserId.>

I had a great experience with this auto shop. Everyone was so friendly and honest and had great communication skills. Their work was exceptional and very reasonably priced. I highly suggest this place if you need any work done! It’s hard to find good, honest businesses these days, but these guys are certainly it!< /text>

I was pleasantly surprised by the welcoming atmosphere and the kindness of the employees; in fact, both interactions brightened my day! I was grateful to have received an in depth explanation of the issue with my car, touching on all points of concern, as well as receiving a full blown report that included pictures. I will gladly bring all my future business here and have already referred a friend.<//review>

<review>The one thing you want when you take your car to a mechanic is to feel
TRUST!  I can honestly say after taking my 2017 Honda Accord for an alignment and oil change at Gold River Automotive  I FOUND MY MECHANIC! You leave with the feeling that they have taken excellent care of your car and did you right. Pricing is fair, service and attention excellent. Leave your car and you'll have peace of mind. Glad I'm able to check ✔️ find a good mechanic off my list! Thank you Gold River Automotive!<//review>< pics>

<text>Had Gold River do a pre purchase inspection on a car I was considering purchasing and so glad I did as I am purchasing from out of state.   They were very professional and through.  Found some issues with the car and and sent pics as well as an estimate they would charge to resolve all the issues.   They also provided a copy to the business selling the car and called and spoke with me about all the issues and how soon they needed to be resolved.   Best 60 dollars I ever spent.   Would definitely use again.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Great, professional, courteous service.
Worth every penny!
And the bonus, about half of the cost the dealer quoted.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</review>

I made an appointment and my car was done timely. Staff was friendly and helpful. Didn’t try and pressure me into anything besides my oil change. I have already recommended them to my mother for her oil changes. I will go back again.< /Review>

<Text>My experience with Gold River Automotive was amazing from the time I called until I drove off their lot. Max was so kind and professional.

We needed a muffler repair to a generator on our small RV, and Gold River Auto did a great job. They had even fabricate a small part or two to make it work. Very much appreciated as the Generator dealer said they couldn't see us for 3 months, and we're planning a trip in late January. I wouldn't have thought to ask them to do this initially, but now that I have, and they did a great job, I'll ask them about other similar work. Thanks guys!<//Text>

I love these guys. They’ve taken care of my ‘99 Camry and more recent, my girlfriend’s ‘99 Ford Taurus. They’re honest, upfront, and do what they say they’ll do. Gold River Auto is a keeper in my book.< /Text>

<review>Maybe, they did a good job. Just a little confused. I wasn't shown or given my old parts. And we agreed on one price then they added tax. When dealing with large quotes , you don't lose the customers future business over the taxes. Sadly ,my car is needing lots of repairs, And they know it. Why lose me over a couple bucks. I asked about the quote and the son said "they're taxes"... Then difference the price. I thought this family owned and ran company, could have seen these issues in the past. It's a really big deal to me. They were awesome with giving me a ride home, when I asked. And the work was done when they said. The father was the one who drove me home to wait the 7 hours ,and he very nice and informative, but that one son...I think his name was ... Max "The weakest link"(I'll call him that).  Overall I give them a 4/10
There are a lot of people out there that can do this kind of work. It's what you do, that's not on the work order, that makes all the difference between you and them.. but then again... This is only from me..
Take care . Be safe 2/21<//review><UserId.>111081181803368542044</UserId.>< Pictures>

My daughter has been bringing her BMW here for a few years and it was my turn for an oil change and needed a professional company I could trust with my Audi A5. They were so friendly affordable and did an amazing job. I love the after report with all the pictures of the inspection sent and any recommendations that may be needed in the future. I’ll be back and referring  my friends and family here.<//Text>

This is not your average shop. These folks go above and beyond to help. The personalized service and care is exceptional in this country these days.

There is a reason they have a rating just a hair below perfect.</review>

Wow! I am excited to place this recommendation! I called yesterday to get my car in for its routine service, and was greeted by Renton who scheduled me for the following day with several time of appointment options. Very pleasant and reasonable rates,with a location close to home I jumped on it. The waiting room was accommodating if you wanted to wait while your car was being worked on. The big surprise was just before I was notified that the service was complete, I was sent a Text With Pictures and a printed report of everything that was inspected and completed! I’ve never been informed so well. Renton let me know what was needed for this one and when to expect a more in-depth service. We have found our new mechanic shop for All of our automotive needs. Which makes me very happy. Thank you Renton for such a pleasant experience!< /review>

<Review>Had my radiator replaced in my 2006 Hyundai Azera, and they sent me a very informative vehicle inspection report, and then we discussed what was immediately important and what could be monitored for a future repair. I appreciated that. They finished the radiator replacement in 24 hours, and lately the dealer has been 10 days out for an appt for service and 2 weeks for parts, so my car would have been out of commission for 3 weeks. These guys were great, and I would use them again!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had a cracked radiator that couldn't be fixed and needed replaced. They did exactly what they said they would do and charged what they estimated...so no surprises. YAY! Everyone was so nice and got the job done quickly. Fast, friendly, reasonably priced and caring. I highly recommend this shop.
Thank you Michael, Max & Renton!

This place is the best.  Great value, do what they say on time, recommend things but in no way pushy, and fo above and beyond.  I have been going here for probably 10+ years after a buddy recommended them who said he’d been “going there forever”.  I think that says somethings.  Great guys, couldn’t recommend more<//review>

Took our 66’ Thunderbird here. It used to be my grandfathers and when we got it, it wouldn’t start. We weren’t sure what all it needed. They did an inspection and there were many things that needed to be fixed and replaced. It was costly but probably not for as much was done. Especially when getting parts isn’t easy. Thank you! We will be returning customers.<//Review>

Love love LOVE this place! I followed Mike here - he used to be at the Midas on Fair Oaks and Greenback, now he's here and I'm so happy I found him!

Super fair prices, excellent work, quick turnaround. I took my 2004 Pilot to a shop near my office (for convenience to work that day), because it was making a weird noise whenever I turned. They determined it to need a power steering flush, and $700 later, it still made that noise!

Yesterday I took the pilot to Mike, let him know about the noise, and that it just hit 200k miles so I'm sure there was extra to be done, and I knew it needed brake pads. Today, I picked up my car, which has: a full oil change, rotated tires, new rear differential fluid, new brake pads, replaced rotors, and all-new transmission fluid. FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME PRICE.

I've never had a better auto service experience ANYWHERE. Trust these guys with your cars! The work is amazing, the lobby is sparkling (and has coffee!), they're doing everything right with COVID. If I could give 10 stars I would!!< /text>

Stopped by on a Saturday morning @ 9:40 on way out of town.  I had squealing issue at low speeds around tire area & was not confident I should continue with trip.  GRA quickly diagnosed, had part delivered & I was on my way a little after 12:00.  Excellent service & they made my weekend!  Thank you 👍😃</text>

I love my own personal mechanic.. but for whatever reason, they could not find the cause of my noisy brakes. I drive a 2013 sedan and it’s in very good shape, so it’s a little annoying pulling up to a stop sign sounding like a school bus.
In one visit, they were able to quickly diagnose the problem. They even went as far as to take pictures with things highlighted for me and ask on how I’d like to proceed. Customer service was amazing. Little to no wait dropping off, despite how busy they are too. The whole experience was just great. I highly recommend taking your vehicle here.<//Review>

< review>
I bought wheels and tires at America’s Tire and since they don’t do wheel alignment, they highly recommended Gold River Automotive and I’m so glad that I followed up on their recommendation. The work was done quickly and efficiently. They were very upfront and honest about the service they provided. They could have easily recommended extra services, but told me that it wasn’t necessary and explained why they thought that. It’s hard to find mechanics who don’t try to hustle you into spending more money. On top of that, everyone that I had dealings with had a great personality, good sense of humor, and were very respectful. The pricing was on point as well. I definitely would recommend all my family and friends get their vehicles worked on by GRA! Thank you GRA for the great experience and I will be seeing you guys again!</review>

This Auto repair shop is excellent. They changed my oil and my car lost all power as soon as I got  on the Freeway. A member of their staff immediately came to me and then and they ran some codes and cleaned off my O2 sensor and I was good to go! They stand by their work and clearly value customer service. I will be giving them mine and my families business moving forward because they kept my car moving forward.</Text>

From start to finish, the employees were friendly, professional, and courteous. I was kept informed of the progress of my car throughout the whole time I was there. Loved that they offered a financing option which greatly helped alleviate some of the financial burden and anxiety car repairs can induce. I even appreciated their waiting area and restroom. Both clean and well decorated...an inviting environment.<//Text>

We have used Gold River Automotive in the past with customers cars when our shop couldn’t do specific jobs. Recently sold our building in doing so lost my shop space, so I knew who to turn to. Needed new pads and rotors turned, done quick and at a fair price.  Made easy even during the COVID pandemic. I will continue to do business and refer business with Gold River Automotive.< /text>

First time customer. I was sent over by a tire shop to repair damage that occurred while mounting a tire. Friendly staff, comfortable waiting area, work was finished in about 30 minutes. Seems like a very well run business. I’ll be returning for some other work I need done on my car.</Review>

< Review>
I couldn't be more happy with Gold River Automotive!!! I was having a hell of a time dealing with my squishy brakes at Roseville Toyota!! They said I needed new break pads and to bleed the lines to fix the problem...450 dollars later my breaks still were squishy... Roseville Toyota wanted to bleed more than brake lines they wanted to bleed my bank account because  they said I needed to fix the master cylinder for 750 more.  Luckily I met someone and we started talking about cars and he said he raved about Renton at Gold River. So I took my Tundra over and talked to Renton and right away I felt comfortable with him and felt he had my best interest!! He ended up diagnosing my break problem and it wasnt even the mastercylynder. That was in great condition! It was the ABS hydraulic pump and he charged me a fraction of what Roseville  Toyota was going to charge me!! I have nothing but good things to say about Renton and his crew at Gold River Automotive! Renton's mom did a great job raising him! And she's a great designer she design the lobby which gives that special touch which separates it from your average shop. Thank you Renton! It feels like I'm driving a brand new truck!

<Review>This place/family is absolutely amazing! Stellar customer service. The are fair priced, transparent/honest and really try to help the customer out as much as possible. I’ve had my AC replaced there (great job) and had my vehicle looked at for an exhaust smell. I had a severe transfer case leak and they even showed me what is was doing to the undercarriage. They recommended I get it checked out by the car manufacturer (Ford) to see if it is covered under warranty. I would recommend them to anyone. Absolutely amazing!! Bring your cars here. Trust me, you’ll be happy you did!< /Review>< Response>

I have never felt completely comfortable with any auto repair place and normally have issues after. Not here! I have used Gold River multiple times now and fully trust them. They put in the extra work to make sure they diagnose and repair the problem correctly the first time. We even have an older trouble car with an issue and after spending all day diagnosing the issues, they gave the recommendation of not worth fixing due to cost compared to the car value and condition. Other places were wrong about the diagnoses and insisted we fix it. Thank you Gold River for your honesty and professionalism!!</Text>

I recommend Gold River Auto for all your repair and maintenance needs. They diagnosed the problem (which my Mercedes-Benz dealer could not pin point), gave me a fair and honest estimate, completed my repair on time, and treated me like I was part of their family. I couldn’t ask for better customer service!< /Review>

These guys are awesome. I live in Ohio and had a vehicle looked over by them from a dealership nearby. They were very informative and gave me a clear third party view at the vehicle. They emailed me a full detailed report to include pictures and made sure to warn me of any deficiencies. Fantastic and professional shop!</Review>

Have you ever gone to an automotive shop and received not only a phone call but a detailed diagnosis and test text about what is working in your car and what is not, with pictures, and to top it off with explanation on why repairs are needed and how it can affect other parts of your car?!?

Well, Gold River Automotive amazed me so much, who would think an automotive shop has such technology and who would invest in that kind of service!

The shop is decorated, clean and the staff is amazing! I'm not going anywhere else for my car service!<//text>

<text>Great place to get your vehicle maintenance taken care of. Place is all decked out with a retro 80s look to it. Outside patio to kick it while waiting. Mike, the owner is very professional and cares about the customers. One thing I would recommend would be add a mini fridge full of bud light for the customers 👍</text>< user>

We have been taking our cars to this super awesome family for years now and every encounter is straight up and honest. We trust their insight so much, we took our newest car to them to look it over before buying. They are true blue! They are so laid back and thoughtful.
Thank you for being good humans ✌<//review>

This has become my go to mechanic. They speak plainly and theres never any surprises. Most importantly, I never feel taken advantage of on price. Also my dog seems to love the staff here for some reason, pretty sure they all have dog treats in their pockets.< /Review>

So grateful to have the staff at Gold River Automotive take care of my son’s car. Renton and Max make you feel at home and appreciated as a customer. This is the one place where I can walk in the door and never question the integrity of the estimate or work on my vehicles. Thank you for being a step above other repair facilities.</review>

As a first time car buyer I had lots of questions and Renton answered all of my questions patiently. I also wasn’t asked to do anything the car doesn’t need. They kept the whole process simple and straightforward. I’ve recommended the place to all friends and family that live in and around the area. We’ve gotten all our vehicles serviced here and trust Gold River Automotive to do an impeccable job each time. :-)< /review>< Pics>

<review>I love these guys! I needed an oil change.  When I called on Friday I was told I would  need to leave it on Saturday morning and they would get to it sometime during the day. When I dropped it in the morning, it was crazy busy. I figured it would take most of the day. I was so surprised when I was called less than 2 hours later. Dropped it off in the morning. I have been here many times. They never disappoint.<//review><GmapID>0x809add8130d6aa45:0xf47ecb65dd1b3a29< /GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< Rate>

< Review>
Good customer service. Technicians are very knowledgeable. Front office explains, in detail, what needs to be serviced. The pictures and print out on the invoices is very helpful for tracking our vehicle maintenance. I highly recommend this company for fleet work as well as personal vehicles. Renton is usually at the front desk, so whether  is just a question,  quote or explanation, he will have your answer. Golden State Equipment Repair highly recommends this company.<//Review>

This is a Family operated business and it feels like it the minute you step foot in the clean well managed establishment. The proprietor is a well established and experienced repair shop owner who I've known through my parents frequenting his first gas station in Carmichael on Walnut Avenue, this was if I recall the mid 1960's. Glad to have such a good, honest repair facility in Gold River.<//Review>

<Text>I am new to the area and wanted to find a good automotive shop. Needing an oil change, I stopped here spontaneously due to proximity. I was immediately impressed with the prompt service I received. Very friendly and welcoming, professional,  knowledgeable, reasonable prices & exceptionally thorough.  It's not  easy to change shops/mechanics after 25 years with the same one. But I was impressed with Gold River Automotive and will not hesitate to return when my car needs something more comprehensive. They gained my trust, respect and appreciation.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Warmly greeted and scheduled by Ms Bobbi, returned Saturday morning to be out the door with No repair$ but with a fresh smog test in a very short time. Renton and Max and team run a very HONEST, FIRST CLASS, Automotive shop. There are a dozen or more things that could've "been wrong" with the error codes my car was showing and I would have been none the wiser had they "repaired them". However, I was treated with honesty and respect and now they have a "Customer for LIFE"!!!

I really love the family atmosphere and the total professionalism that GFA provides and the speed in which I got my car back but the main reason is they call you and let you know that you don’t need a repair done because it’s not needed. Saved me almost 200$ I would recommend them to everyone I know.</text>

They give a clear picture of what the problem is and with my car it took 3 attempts to find the actual problem.  But once they did they also offered to discount the cost of the first repair from the completed bill.

I'm from the Bay Area and needed an auto inspection for a car I was considering to buy in Gold River. First off, I got the warmest greeting from the woman who answered my call and then she turned me over to Renton who gladly welcomed me to come in on Presidents Day! I was super excited that they were even open and were able to accommodate me at such short notice.
Super clean, friendly, fast and honest. Feels like a family that works together with keeping a solid business integrity! Go see these guys!< /Text>

< review>
Friendly and very professional technical staff. Pretty knowledgeable about automobile workings myself, I realized my car was in the hands of experts. Was there for just an oil and filter change.
The technician picked up a subtle steering issue in pulling the car into and out of the bay. The office did an online search and discovered a service fix that the dealer had not given notice. Since they do not do that work, I was confident in their thorough expertise and honesty. They printed out the service bulletin for me so I could follow up with the dealer.
Their service has definitely earned my loyalty.
A bonus, their waiting area is beautifully decorated, and with coffee, treats and good magazines, I'm back with our second car tomorrow!<//review>

<review>This is a trustworthy family run business.  As a mechanical engineer I usually don't like taking my vehicles to have someone fix them because I could not find mechanics that I could trust.  However, every time I have taking my vehicles to Gold River Automotive, they take care of the issue at a very fair price and I never feel like I and being hoodwinked.  Yesterday, I dropped in in the afternoon unannounced with my AC Blower motor not working and had my car back working before the end of the day.  Now, I take all my vehicle here to have them fixed when there is an issue versus taking up my time fixing them.  I highly recommend them if you are looking for a fair and honest place to take your vehicles.</review>< username>

This is my second time bringing my car here and both times they were amazing. The dealer gave me a laundry list of things wrong with my car along along with a $5,500 estimate. I took my car to gold river automotive for a second opinion. They were able to catch a very serious issue that the dealer missed along with fixing most of the issues on that hefty laundry list for more than half the dealer price. I got my car back driving better than it did in years! Thank you gold river automotive !< /review>

I love the newer ownership.  They are very honest and have reasonable pricing.  I bring all three of my vehicles here for every service.   They have even done free stuff like replacing fuses and bulbs.  Top notch business with top notch customer service.<//Text>

<review>Renton and his team provide top notch service at a reasonable price.  The service they have provided for my vehicles has been nothing less than outstanding.  They provide a full written assessment of the vehicle and detail things that need attention.   I am happy to recommend them to anyone looking to get their vehicle serviced !!<//review>< date>

We always have such a great experience at Gold River Automotive. They’re kind, professional, reasonably priced, trustworthy, and go out of their way to make it a positive experience. The waiting area is inviting and my young daughter always enjoys the seasonal candy treats available. The service advisors are always incredibly kind and helpful. They update often, explain well (and show pictures), and I have never felt pressured to do any kind of repair. The service is first-rate. We walked to pick up my car on a hot day and my car was brought around with the air conditioning on and when I walked to the car I noticed they had even loaded my daughter’s bike for us!<//review>

I tried them for the first time this week as was impressed.  Renton was helpful and detailed in his explanation. The solution required an inexplicably expensive part that looked exactly like a part selling retail at 1/10th the cost. He was sympathetic and didn’t mark it up. I did my homework and found out he was correct. It is a different part and the manufacturer calls for it. The labor cost to install was fair and he performed some other courtesy tasks for free.

I like how they handle people here. I’ll be back.<//Text>

I priced out a repair at several other shops because Gold River’s quote was so high...in the end they came in as the least expensive and about $100 cheaper than four out of the five other shops I tried. Renton is friendly and gives good advice, and cares more about the customer than getting one more sale.< /Text>

<Text>I’ll try to keep this short, I could go on for pages about this shop.

I’ve been bringing my vehicles to them since 2006/2007. I have never trusted anyone more with my vehicles. They have consistently saved me money on repairs for the past 12+ years. I’ve brought two different 4runners (1997 and 2006), Toyota Camry (2004), Toyota Corolla (2016), Kia Optima (2014), Mitsubishi Montero (1996), Nissan Stanza (1991), Nissan Pathfinder (2007), Mercedes e350 (2009), Mercedes C230 (1996), the list goes on...this track record solidifies my point, they have integrity that is unparalleled.

This is not to say there aren’t great mechanics out there of the same moral fiber, but if you’re reading this chances are you’re probably in search of a new place to call your home shop. Look no further.

New location is awesome, cute decorations and a nice patio/waiting area (during the summer there’s and outdoor waiting area that’s sweet). They’ve got more bays than it seems as well, I thought it was just the few seen on coloma, there’s an additional like 8 bays behind it.

I send my family, friends, and complete strangers over the internet to them because I know they’ll get the same honest service as me. They’ve fixed every. single. thing. I have ever brought their way lol.

They now take pictures and send a nice hyperlink to take you to your own private page thats show your car images, specs, and recommendations on your vehicle. I’ve never felt pressured to make repairs, not once. They have always worked with me and found the best/most affordable options.

As expected, they’re a busy shop, because they earned it. They have always done their best to get me in ASAP. From oil changes, to re-wiring my electronics in a project car, to brake changes, to serious engine work, they’ve always gotten the job done right.

It’s very apparent in everything that is done here that this is run by a family who cares a lot about their business and their customers.  Unexpected work needing to be done on your car is a stressful experience, but the quality of the service here from the moment I called until I drove my car home was exceptional.  The office is so clean and inviting, very homey.  And everyone working there is so friendly and welcoming and clearly want you to feel comfortable and well cared for.  Once I dropped my car off, the owner was even kind enough to use their shuttle service to give me a ride home because my car wouldn’t be ready until the next day.  She was so sweet and caring!  Prices were very reasonable for the work that needed to be done on my car.  To be honest, they were so nice I wouldn’t have minded if the prices were higher because I didn’t feel stressed like I normally do at other repair shops.  I will absolutely be bringing all my business with my car here from now on.</Review>

Been a cuatomer for several years. The service and the customer service was excellent! They have an online system where the mechanic will upload pictures of the parts damaged under the hood for you to review. I never feel cheated here.</Review>

<Review>I went in to have my car serviced and I can not tell you how impressed I was with the service and the friendliness.  First the waiting room was spotless and inviting, second I was greeting at the counter by smiling young man who was friendly and knowledgeable, third when my car was done I received an informative text message that let me know my vehicle was ready and also the overall condition of the main components of the car.    They have truly learned to combine old style friendliness with  current technology to create a great experience.  Great job Gold River Automotive!!!!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
My car began making knocking sounds whenever I drove so I decided call them to take a look since I've used their services before for engine & coolant change as well as a transmission drain and fill and was satisfied with their prices and service. Decided to come back for a repair.

Called them in the morning around 9:30am and let them know I wanted to have it looked at but didn't have a ride back and they said to bring it in and they could drop me off. I lived nearby.

Arrived and was checked in and greeted by Renton.  Friendly guy. Looking around, the lounge area was clean, and they had Keurig coffee ready for brew, a water dispenser, a little candy tray, as well as a large bin of what looked like circus animal crackers.  I thought it was a bit weird to have all the snacks and coffee next to the entrance of the bathroom but the bathroom looked very clean for an autoshop.

After checking in, Renton told me their person who drops people off was off doing just that and wasn't available but would be able to have me dropped off in my own car by another associate if I was ok with it. Which I was.

I later received a call and was told of the issue (breaking or broken engine and transmission mounts) and of the estimate to repair. Parts and labor included (they would have to order the parts) and they would have it done by the end of the day. Googled around and it seemed like a fair price so I said yes.

What I was bothered by if anything at all with this experience was that I had to call them at the end of the day to ask for the status of my car since it was closing time for them and they hadn't called me yet. My assumption is that they were very busy. The person I was able to speak with said the parts came in late and they would be finished by the next day late morning.  It was more like near end of day but I wasn't in a rush to get it so long as it was before end of day.

Received my car and it was sounding better than before without the knocking and other sounds of course.  I'm satisfied with my services and the price at which they charge and will be taking my cars back for other services including maintenance services.</Review>

<Review>I read some review online that did not look good at all.  But then  I learned that was old management and they are under new management.  I  was so happy with their service.  They were courteous, checked out my old car and gave me excellent advice regarding keeping or selling.  They could have told me I just needed a lot of work and taken advantage of me, being a single older female as someone had done last year.  But they gave me sound advice about cutting my losses and getting a different car at this point.  They even pulled up some others online to show me.  When I buy I will definitely bring it back here for maintenance.  They are kind, courteous and honest.  Hard to find in today's world.  I whole heartedly recommend Gold River Automotive!<//Review><name>K Kramer<//name>< gmap_id>

Came in for an oil change and was greeted with a friendly and fast acting staff. They provided a comprehensive report with photos of the problems and made an appointment for the items in their report. Definitely recommend using Gold River Auto.<//text>

< Review>
Had some heavy maintenance done to it. A few weeks later the vehicle started leaking oil from the same spot I had repaired. Renton was honest with me and said they had to redo the work because of a grommet had been installed but didn't seat properly and that they were in the process of fixing it at no cost to me. Now, you are probably thinking that im only writing a good review on them because of this, but I have gone to shops that messed up work before and they flat out refuse to admit they messed up. It takes a lot for a shop owner to admit they need to re-do work they already completed. Very grateful.<//Review>

<Review>Someone representing Gold River auto repair came to our door and SOLD us 4 coupons for $50 for oil changes. We were not that interested but the guy assured us that its a great deal and that they never expire. Well that is not true now is it? We used 2 and now they won't accept them anymore! This rating has nothing to do with the quality of work they do, so please don't get that confused with this review is based on how they treat members of our community. They owe me 2 oil changes or a refund of at least 1/2 my money back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>I've been searching for a very long time for a garage as excellent as GRA. I think it's very important in life, to know a good and even.more importanly, an "honest" shop to take your car to. Ever since my previous long time (20+ yrs) mechanic "Tom" over at Fort Sutter Automotive, sold his shop and retired. I have found myself with one bad, to very bad, experience after the next over the past several years. Each time, being left with this bitter taste of being screwed over again. But finally, at last. I have found my favorite garage in town. I immediately felt a delightfully comfortable home spun feeling right when I walked thru there front door..this place really is just the best with great vibes.Seriously, they're really  fair with prices, prices that I know are fair and honest, because at first, I checked, I compared.
These folks aren't out to ripp anyone off..not an easy thing to find these days. They are super professional, organized and just about the nicest staff of "real" people I've ever experienced at any automotive repair shop in my 43 years of owning a car..Also.. The restrooms are spotless, complete with the coolest handmade bar soap ever. For me.? It's often about the revealing little things. It's so nice to be able to relax, feeling confident that these mechanics know what there doing and aren't out to take advantage of you.They are even thoughtful enough to take care of the little "extras" ie: burnt out bulbs, a fuse, tire pressure, with time and integrity..They actually really do care about doing good work and customer satisfaction.I am so happy to have finally found my new repair garage. I'd drive 100 miles to take my repair needs to Gold River Automotive. Selfishly, I just hope this shop doesn't get to big and popular, (for being so great) that they won't be able to keep on doing things just as they are doing things right now. Thank you for being there GRA

<text>I can't speak 100% to the full services that Gold River offers as I am not a direct customer; however, the issues I had with the services rendered for me appear to be partially a communications issue with the person who brought the vehicle to Gold River for work not properly specifying the work to be performed.

Speaking with Renton on this issue cleared up some details of the situation, because of this I feel it is unfair to leave the fully negative feedback I originally left but I don't have full feedback to provide.

Even for a quick "Safety Inspection" prior to selling a vehicle, there are very obvious and fairly major issues that should have been noted on the inspection report that were not. Broken core support, open PCV hose on the top of the valve cover, and bent hood latch were all clearly visible and the only "bad mark" the car got was that it needed new front tires. I agreed to purchase a vehicle based on this report after believing a full pre-purchase inspection had been done and now have a vehicle in need of repairs well in excess of 50% of the purchase price ($4,500+ of repairs needed).

If you speak with the folks here about the services you want performed, it is likely that you'll get what you are after with some good communication.<//text>< Pictures>

They really take care of you. He made sure I knew the actual value of the car, and drew up an estimate of anything he found that would need fixing. I had gotten a really bad feeling from the guy I was looking to buy from, and they helped cement what I was feeling, ended up walking away, and am glad I did. Extremely courteous, and great people. If I lived there, I would use them everytime. If you go to them, you will be very happy with their service.</Review>< pics>

These folks have taken care of my car (now on my second car) for 13 years.  After a dealership (twice) told me I needed major repairs, these folks said I didn't and my car was fine.  Not many people do that anymore especially when they know you don't know if what they are telling you is right or not.  I wouldn't take my vehicles anywhere else.</Review>

<Time>1534831902379</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I Inherited my family’s van and finally had the cash to put into tuning it up. I personally installed new double platinum plugs, premium wires and I just had my quadrajet carb rebuilt. I wanted a good shop to tune the carb due to time restraints and my lack of tools to adjust the primary and secondary pulloff linkages. I looked around and had seen the many good reviews of gold river automotive and called to ask if they could adjust the carb on my G30 van. The owners son said his dad was able to do it so I brought it in.

The next day I was called and told the carb was unserviceable and was given multiple reasons why I needed to have the unit replaced from bad floats, plugged Jets to “they just go bad”. (Again, this carb was freshly rebuilt, by the book, and to spec). Instead of arguing that the carburetor was in good condition and indeed not “bad”, I decided to just write it off as an “it is what it is” situation.

After taking the van back I noticed the van was performing poorer than when I had dropped it off.

So, I called my stepfather ( a 40 year ASE cert master mechanic) and made the several hour drive down to him to have it looked at. Not only did my van cry the whole way, it ate gas and was gutless.

While I was down at my parents for the weekend, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to replace the whole distributor since we had found the old ones vacuum advance was sticking and rusted from age. Now, having replaced all the above, we focused on the carb issue. This is where it got fun. After setting the carb to “stock specs” we started the van and tested it out. The carb seemed to work but we kept getting an intermittent cylinder dropping out which was causing all sorts of issues. So we went back and started tracing the issue all over again.

After some troubleshooting we found cylinder 3&5 were not firing. So, we figured we must of had a plug gum up or was defective....

What I found has never made me so furious in my life....

Not only was the carb fine and just needed adjustment, I found that ALL my BRAND NEW (less than 50 miles at the time) double platinum spark plugs had been removed and replaced with Standard copper plugs (AP25's to be exact). 2 of the 8 had bent ground tabs touching the electrodes!!  They also cross threaded my air filter wing nut which was fun getting off. They are the ONLY people to have had access to under the doghouse of my van, there is no way a random person would just steal my plugs and replace them with damaged used plugs

Not only did they try to get me to spend 100's on a new carb, they (one of the techs) must have sabotaged my van and stole $50 worth of spark plugs (plus another $50 for new ones and the insane amount of fuel to drive down to have a real master mechanic fix the original issue)

I would not recommend this place and find this to be downright dishonest

Edit:
Anyone who threatens legal action against a detailed and honest review is certainly not a place I would want to do business with.
I have however have a rebuttal for the below message and threatening voicemail left.
Until I see uncut and unedited footage of the entire stay of my van, my statements stand.
No tweeker would just steal my plugs and put in old damaged ones as Renton insisted was the case. Not only would they have to go unnoticed by my cameras, they would have to physically break into my van, pull the engine cover, swap the plugs, then put everything back.
However, the cover was off while in your care and when I came in to get my van back, the vehicle was unlocked.
Not only have I moved out of state but it serves no purpose to write untruths when the whole ordeal was neutral? I never demand anything, not once had I mentioned anything other than the shock that someone stole my plugs while parked there and the mention that I'm assuming that an employee was responsible (again, what random person carries damaged plugs and just swaps them out on someone which would take a lot of work) it is however much more believable that a shop that changes plugs all day long has not only the old plugs but the tools to do it.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1534801692793, 'text': 'I am writing this as rebuttal to your hostile, negative posting. I do this only because you have falsely accused our shop of theft and “sabotage” of your vehicle, very serious and totally untrue allegations.  Expressing an opinion is certainly one’s right, but libelous accusations cannot go unchallenged.\nOn August 6, 2018, you brought your 1985 G Series van to Gold River Automotive requesting that we adjust a rebuilt quadrajet carburetor, which you stated, you personally, had just installed in the vehicle.  You stated that your vehicle was running rough and that although you had been working on the van in an effort to restore it, you did not have the tools necessary to make carburetor adjustments yourself.  Reflective of the general condition of your van, when you arrived at Gold River Automotive, your radiator hose blew off in our lot while you were attempting to park the vehicle.  You stated you must have left it loose when you replaced it.\nThe following day, your carburetor was inspected in our parking lot by my husband, Michael Palmer, an active ASE Master Certified Technician with 50 years of experience; Michael is also a well-respected adjunct Professor of Automotive Technology at American River College.  After a 20 minute visual inspection of your carburetor, Michael concluded that he should not make any carburetor adjustments due visible internal gas leakage, which could have several causes, such as dirt in the carburetor, a sticky needle value or float.  He suggested you return the defective carburetor, for warranty repairs or a refund, to the shop where it had been rebuilt.  (You had not acknowledged, prior to your Yelp review, that you actually rebuilt the carburetor yourself).  You were not charged for Michael’s visual inspection of your vehicle, nor did our shop attempt to sell you any other parts or services.   The findings of the carburetor inspection were noted on work estimate #001431, which you signed.\nYou have now published a very negative review of our shop, Gold River Automotive, wherein you falsely alleged that a Gold River Automotive technician “sabotaged my van and stole $50.00 worth of spark plugs”.  You also stated that Gold River Automotive tried to “get me to spend 100’s on a new carburetor”.   You concluded that Gold River Automotive was “downright dishonest.”\nAll of these allegations are entirely false, ludicrous and libelous!  Your van was under video surveillance during the entire time it was at our shop and the recordings clearly show Michael, and ONLY Michael, leaning across the passenger seat while looking at the carburetor.  Michael did not sabotage your van in any way or steal your used spark plugs, as you allege!  These are truly ridiculous charges and I am unable to understand your motivation in making such false and harmful statements.  Your unfounded allegations clearly seek to tarnish the reputation Gold River Automotive has established for providing our valued customers with honest and professional quality automotive service.\nBobbi Palmer, Owner'}<//Resp>
