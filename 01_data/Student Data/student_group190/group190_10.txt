When I found out about this wash I immediately went to check it out. Bought a pass and have been cleaning my car weekly ever since.
LOVE this place and the employees have always been super kind and helpful. Happily give this place all of my car wash business< /text>< rating>

<time>1553718318933</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I really wanted to love this place. The car wash selection in Thousand Oaks isn't that great. For the most part I've been satisfied. Today I bought the most expensive car wash and paid for my minivan to be cleaned out. It was a bit of a mess. The attandant didn't move the seat and my middle row is still filled with crumbs and untouched. Then I glanced at the third row and the seats were not touched or even wiped down. I paid for top serivce today and had much high expectations. Save your money!< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxTIQpRjRvMedCE-xoqGDz_Vg14YItyRLvS26D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtvQQQCXi7Vts1CEmyEWDRKBrYEhqQ58TKbvts=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Such an easy experience, it includes a 5 minute vaccum.  Each bay has 2 hoses, one on each side. If you bring a friend you can handle the vehicle intact time.  Great spot, I would recommend & visit again!</Review><username>Rachel Halfaker</username>< response>

Excellent resource in the Conejo Valley for anyone that loves a clean vehicle.  Wonderful service and staff.  I've been there a couple of times and am very impressed with the manager and how well run and efficient the establishment is.  Thank you Aaron for being so nice!</Text>

Sign says better than hand wash. Ha , yeah right. Where do premium vehicles go to get a wash? A hand wash.
1. Do you wanna dry your car if you pay for a service? No.
2. Do you wanna vacuum, no.
3. The track had my wheel rubbing , had to adjust wheel , damage ? Maybe gotta look under car now.
4. Wheels were not cleaned , had to do at home.  noticed w car in front of me the wheel cleaning brush was not synced w vehicle . It pulsed towards car after it passed .

Conclusion: had to dry , vacuum and clean wheels myself . This place was a nice inclusive hand wash , cant imagine they will keep same clientele . No thanks< /Review>

I have a Red Carpet Thousand Oaks Car Wash gift card worth about $120.  I've sent multiple requests to the new owners asking if they will honor or convert the card to a Thousand Oaks Speedwash card.  They refuse to respond to any of my emails.  Guess I'll have to show up and create a scene.

After posting my one star review, I was contacted by the owners of T.O. Speedwash.  They stated that they never got any of my emails which is strange because I created the emails on their web site by selecting the "Contact Us" link which took me to their email form.  I completely filled out the form and clicked the send button, so they must have an issue with that page.

T.O. Speedwatch owners stated that they will honor my Red Carpet gift card, I just have to go to the location and present the card to the manager.  I did that and she issued me a new T.O. Speedwatch gift card for the full $120.  She was very nice and helpful.

I have upgraded my one star review to a four star review.  Will update again when I'm need my car washed.<//text>

You are more than welcome to use your gift card at the new car wash, your balance will remain in tact from the old Red Carpet site or we will gladly issue you compensation for the balance.  Please stop in and speak with our manager and we can take care of it to your satisfaction.\n\nI would appreciate information on where you tried contacting us as our info@ email does not have any record of an email regarding your trouble.  Hopefully we can resolve your issue and you will change your mind (and the 1 star review) and enjoy the new wash!"}<//response>

<review>I love this place! My car has never been cleaner after a wash from other companies. They truly pay attention to Every single detail and do a tremendous job!!

Always a five star experience. They provide a quality service on a consistent basis. They take their time and cover every detail. They are head and shoulders above any other car wash in Thousand Oaks. I love the flat monthly rate which allows you to wash your car as many time as you wish. For not much more money you can get a stellar inside and out detail. They made my old tired front lights sparkle like new.< /review>

Been going here for years, great price and thorough wash!  Their monthly $49.99 unlimited wash deal is the best deal ever, but unfortunately they found out I have a commercial vehicle so I’ve been removed.  Really hoping they change their mind because I’d hate to take my business elsewhere!</text>

<Review>I was there just over a month ago. I agree with those who used to wash their cars there before new owners took over. It was impeccable car wash for years, best in the county. But now they charge more and give you less for your money. Luckily, I don't have a plan, so they won't see my car neither get my money. I'm done with that place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>By far the best carwash!!👍 I've been coming here for years they do excellent work on cleaning my car from the vacuume to the wash. It does not matter how busy they are they get my car in and out in approximately 20 to 30 minutes its 5 star carwash!
On top of the great service i always enjoy a free Starbucks coffee... Thank you Red Carpet! Clean really does feel good!<//text><userid>109353680586417100061<//userid>< time>

I'm not expecting a detail, but way too much dust left in the cracks inside, wheels not 100%, didn't touch the exhaust tips, etc. To top it off, they want extra to dress the tires. For $24.99 you need to include that folks.</text>< pics>

Gave it one star down just because when i had CC fraud and my bank closed my old card, instead of red carpet suspending my monthly account temporarily, they closed my account. I was paying the old lower rate and when i opened a new account they bumped me to the current rate. Just seems like they should have made a little more effort to keep a long time loyal customer happy.

Other than that, love the place. They offer lots of seating options, TV, and free coffee though i don't usually partake. I like to watch the my baby being cleaned. The staff does an excellent job at cleaning the cars inside and out. The staff works hard... cant express how impressed i am with the job they do while dealing with the weather day in and out from the extremely cold days to the days the sun is baking. I also have to say i commend RCCW on the improvements they have implemented to update the facility and to make a better working environment for their staff.<//text>

Great car wash....just too much money. $44.95 a month now. I brought my first car here in 2014... $29.95. 50% increase in two years. It's getting ridiculous at this point. Sorry guys but see ya later. 3 cars btw.</Review>

My new truck of 9 months had shown the wear and tear (no dings) of ranch living.  Ranato promised a lot and he and his team delivered.  My truck looked and felt showroom  ready.  Their pricing was considerably less that other places, as well.< /review>

Worse car wash evere. Want to charge me extra $10 because the car is extra dirty. If the car wasn't dirty I wouldn't come for a car wash. Stay away from it. When I asked to speak to the owner the girl I think her name is quira said its a corporation and there is no owner.</review>

<text>I had an amazing experience from beginning to end. The staff was professional ad courteous every step of the way. I visited both the Pasadena and Huntington Beach office and was thoroughly impressed by both. The pricing was upfront, honest, and fair. I highly recommend anyone thinking about getting LASIK done to choose Global Lasik Institute.<//text></record>

I had the best experience at this place! From beginning until the end all of the staff were courteous and just so nice! Marisela was thorough with explaining everything I needed to know prior to getting the procedure done, after the procedure, and even my financing options. Dr. Nguyen is like an angel sent from heaven. She is so nice and makes you feel so comfortable. She made sure that all of my questions were answered before deciding on going through with the procedure. On the day of my surgery everything went smoothly. Everyone was encouraging and made me feel less anxious. The surgeons were gentle that I felt very little pain. Miss Beverley was so helpful after the procedure! She made sure that I was transferred in between rooms and handed to my ride safely. I live quite far from this place but I do not mind coming back for future appointments! This place is truly the best!<//text>

I had the most amazing Lasik experience. The  staff is super friendly and actually takes the time to walk you through the whole procedure in advance and once again during the surgery. I was kinda nervous, but the surgery went pretty smooth. Had 20/20 vision the next morning.< /Text>

< Review>
Had my surgery done at the Lasik Institute in Ontario, CA. I feel my eyes is worse off now. Called today to be told that they are closed permanently, and my life long guarantee is no longer.

Should have went with my instincts when talking with the dr. He was not knowledgeable, but I went ahead thinking he was not actually doing the surgery:(< /Review>

If I could give this business a thousand stars I would. I just had the lasik procedure last night and I’m in such awe. I’ve cried happy tears twice this morning because I can’t remember the last time i could wake up and not have to reach for my glasses before I could see. The entire team at global eye and laser institute made me feel so comfortable from the moment I walked in. Shout out to Dr. Melikian, Dr. Nguyen, Rose, and Carolina. You all made me feel so comfortable and taken care of. Honestly, the entire staff is amazing!</review>

I just had my surgery 3 days ago and I could not be happier!! I cannot wait to see how my eyes are in 2 weeks. I'm already seeing so good. My experience was wonderful. The staff was very friendly and they were very good at keeping you calm during the procedure.  I would recommend anyone considering Lasik to come here. Thank you!!< /Review>

This place is fantastic and I would choose them again 100%. The staff were so nice I'm almost sad I don't have a reason to come back again. I immediately felt like their friend and they went through all safety extremely thoroughly. They didn't try to upsell me on options other doctors might have. I could always joke around with them and then just really made me comfortable throughout all of the prep work and the procedure. I think even during the eye surgery laser portion the guy was massaging my head to calm me down.<//review>

When I went in for my Lasik consultation they discussed everything with me and the day of my surgery, all staff made my nerves go away and they were so sweet and very accommodating! 2 weeks later and I have much better vision than I ever did and I’m excited for it to get even better!

<user_name>Bryn Gier</user_name><review>I can see so very clearly now thanks to this facility and Dr Melikian. The staff is a group of individuals that really truly care about their patients and really took the extra time to answer alllll of my questions. Dr Nguyen was so nice and fun to talk to.
Let’s be real here you want to get better vision but the sound of lasers in your eyes isn’t exactly comforting. Read all of these five star reviews and you will feel comfortable. Schedule your consultation and get ready to be wowed by the awesome staff who will guide you through the entire process. I have never felt so at home in a doctors office before. It was all a very quick, relatively painless procedure.
My eyes were pretty bad and I was not a candidate for traditional Lasik but I was PRK eligible with contoura. First few days were rough but I slept through it. Took a couple weeks off work for recovery time and had it done. Best decision I’ve ever made. Life changing.
I love coming for my follow ups and am so happy I get to leave such positive feedback for the doctors and staff here. They are truly the best!</review><UserId.>113247673356921557249< /UserId.>< response>

My results have been incredible, and I'm so grateful to them for taking the time and care needed to make me comfortable. You can't go wrong by coming to this team! They're A+++ all the way.

When I first came in for my consult a few weeks ago, I felt nervous because I was not sure what to expect. I have to say the place right away looked very professional and I was greeted with bright smiles from Beverly,Jonas, and Ivonne. The doctors were very professional and very informative. They all answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable with the procedure. Yesterday was my surgery and everyone was very attentive and Beverly checked in on me often making sure I was comfortable and ok. The doctors during the surgery were very attentive as well and walked me though everything that was happening which made me feel more comfortable. Today, I am here for my follow up and I my vision is excellent. Again, I was greeted with bright smiles. I feel fabulous as Beverly said and I recommend this place for anyone considering getting LASIK surgery.</text>

<text>As Horrible as 2020 has been this place has been the highlight of the year. The Wonderful Staff, the great service is what really won me. They were really caring from the start and just wanted to help. Getting Lasik was not as bad as I expected. If I had any questions they were there to reinsure me everything will be ok. Overall if you are considering getting Lasik I would point you here.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Adalid Cuevas< /username><Resp>{'time': 1604182590286, 'text': 'Hi Adalid , We love hearing feedback like this from our patients.

<Review>The entire staff was so friendly, genuine and honest. They made me feel at ease and answered all of my questions, no matter how silly or odd. The consultation was thorough and they had my best in mind, always.  They were warm and welcoming to my parents who drove me to my surgery appointment. The staff was helpful throughout my procedure day of. They provide an on-call doctor to support you post operation who was kind, thorough and knowledgeable. This is a scary and intimidating procedure to consider and I would go to no one else but this team for all my needs. Outstanding staff,  outstanding team, outstanding experience.  I recommend them to all. I am grateful to them for giving me the most incredible gift- 20/20 vision (the day after!) it’s remarkable and life changing. Thank you.<//Review>< pictures>

My experience was nothing short of amazing. The people there were remarkably kind and welcoming. They all played a key role in helping me have an unforgettable experience, accompanied with the freedom of not having to use glasses anymore. The process and procedure was outstanding. Huge thank you to Dr Nguyen, Jonas, Beverly, Rose, Diana, Ivonne and the whole team! I recommend this exact place to get your LASIK surgery hands down.<//review>

They welcomed me into the office as if I had been here for years! I was nervous at first with the prospect of Lasik but soon was put at ease by the amazing Beverly, Ivonne, Diana, Jonas, and Dr. Nguyen. They immediately explained the entire process and reassured me that everything would work out perfectly! I was recommended here by a friend that has had theirs done for 10 years and he still has perfect vision. It been a month and a half post op and I can see 20/15 which is better than 20/20 :). I cannot recommend this place enough, I have been telling all of my friends and coworkers to come here!

Update 12/7/2020

I can’t believe it’s been a year since my surgery. My eyes are still doing so well and I can see 100%. I am so incredibly glad I decided to get LASIK, being able to see all the time without worrying about glasses or contacts has been a life changer for me. If you’re looking for a sign to come to this office and get LASIK here it is.< /review>< pictures>

There is the worse service ever. They have closed a lot of their offices around California and refuse to provide the promised following-up appointments forcing you pay extra money for a third-party service or drive hundreds of miles to their closest office. If you got an appointment and it was canceled or re-scheduled nobody let you know. Don't waste your time and health working with these people.</Review>

The team here is phenomenal! I can't stress enough how professional and knowledgeable this office is. I had my initial surgery years ago and came here for a touch up. Everyone (Dr. Nguyen, Rose, Ivonne, Beverley, Jonas, and Diana) is super and I have already recommended them to my friends and colleagues. Rose especially has been helpful in even taking the time to fix the settings in my phone to fit my new eyes.

I would not hesitate to give them a call and see what amazing things they can do for you! I would not trust anyone else with my eyecare!<//Review>

I received all-laser LASIK at this location about 1.5 years ago and to date I am seeing 20/15.  I cannot speak more highly of Beverly, Jonas, Rose, Ivonne, Diana, and Dr. Melikian.  All aspects of the process from intake to surgery to after-care have been top-notch.  I had previously had a consultation at Nvision Laser Center in Newport Beach prior to finding this place per referral from my co-worker, Jennifer.  At Nvision I felt very much just another number.  At LASIK Vision Institute / Global Laser Vision they made me feel like an old friend and comfortable through the whole process.  I love these folks and owe them a huge debt of gratitude.  Thank your everyone.< /Review>

Had the best experience ever !!! From the first visit Rose was very nice in explaining the process of all the test that would be done to determine if I was a candidate and Diana explained the cost and payment options in great detailed. Dr Nguyen did all the needed eye test and explained the process of surgery in detail and answered all my questions. The day of surgery Dr Bavand was very nice and calming and explained every step so I knew what to expect. As for the actual surgery it’s very fast and NOT PAINFUL AT All the laser part is only some seconds long. After surgery Beverly was great in after care instructions and making sure I had a safe ride home she’s very sweet. All in all it was a great experience I recommend it to anyone needing it.</Text>

I highly recommend  LASIK Vision Institute as your destination if you are planning to get surgery. The staff here are wonderful and very considerate. The atmosphere are friendly and professional. Beverly, Yvonne, Rose, Jonas, Diana, and the doctors all will remember who you are everytime you come back, like you are an old friend. They takes necessary steps to ensure that your surgery will be, safe, successful and that your experience is a great one. I surely will recommend LASIK Vision Institute to anyone who are on the fence and looking for a trustworthy place.< /text>

<text>I was very nervous about the surgery. I knew what to expect since the staff had explained to me all details prior to the appointment, however I was still nervous. The procedure was literally done in "a blink of an eye." The doctors were very professional and made the entire process very comfortable. The staff had such an amazing customer service. The results are just mesmerizing!!! I got 20/20 vision now! I've been wearing glasses for over 22 years and the minute I walked out of my surgery I could see everything!

I had such a wonderful experience getting LASIK. I was worried because of my eye anxiety and if I would panic when the surgeon is putting a laser in my eyeballs. But it wasn’t that bad. They gave me drugs to relax me and everyone was so friendly and accommodating. I now have 20/20 vision!<//review>

The staff here are amazing. I have worked with Dr Nguyen, Rose, Ivonne and I’m missing other that have superior customer service and made the whole process easy.

I was nervous to have Lasik done and now that I have and my eye sight is better than ever with NO glasses! I can’t praise enough for others to have this done. The process was painless! The procedure wasn’t anything I would have though with the colors while the complete the surgery. I won’t lie that night was very uncomfortable for me as Tylenol pm does not work for me in particular but I can’t complain it was surgery and being uncomfortable is always part of a surgery but.... the next day not having to put glasses in to see was wonderful!!!

I had an issue with dry eye as I work in a computer all day and when I called they got me in the same day! And the solution..... use the eye drops more often. And start taking fish oil ( I’ll admit I’m not a fan taking fish oil with the possibility of it coming back up but WOW it makes such a big difference!) so get this done and take fish oil tablets and you won’t regret it!</Review>

I came in for glasses and was hugely disappointed after 2 tries to get my progressives correct. Neither prescription was good once they put it into eye glass form. I had to settle for the one that was best for distance for driving. But I am so unhappy with how they do glasses. I do not have a difficult prescription and have always had good glasses over the years. I was told to get cheap reading glasses by the staff to help with my close up readings. I should not have to do that. I now have to wait a total of two years before my insurance will pay for another pair. The glasses leave me dizzy and foggy and my eyes very tired. Wherever they send out their glasses to doesn't do good work. The "blend" on the glasses is very distorted after three tries to get it correct. The only reason they have 2 stars is the staff was nice, tried to be helpful, and polite.< /Text>

I chose this center because I loved how friendly and informative the staff was. I did my own research and had the chance to speak to the surgeon over the phone, and he answered other questions I had along the way, which definitely put me at ease as well! I felt comfortable going into surgery thanks to the reassurance and positive comments from all the staff here! I had PRK done right before Thanksgiving, and although it was a painful and lengthy recovery time, I'm very close to 20/20 vision now, and I'm so happy!! I definitely recommend anyone to come here for a consultation! You'll be happy you did and happier with the wonderful results!! So thankful for everyone here at Lasik Vision Institute in Huntington Beach! Great customer service and expertise :) Five+ stars!<//review>

I am so pleased with my experience. Everything went smoothly. From my first consultation to the day of surgery, I felt at ease because of each of the staff working are Lasik Vision Institute. I just got back from my follow up the next day and I now have 20/20 and they said my eye is still healing so it can be even better! I am so thankful for this experience and the staff at the Huntington Beach location! Highly recommend anyone that is tired of either wearing glasses or contacts. Huntington Beach has 5 stars over 350 + ratings and now I can say I’m one of them too!<//Text>

The staff has been very helpful from the beginning. Always welcoming me when I walk in, they have answered any and all questions that I had. On the day of my procedure they were helpful and comforting. They thoroughly explained the process and what to expect. When it came time for the procedure, it was quick and painless. I came in the next day for a follow up and could see no problem. Would definitely recommend both this location and procedure for anyone thinking about Lasik. My only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner.< /Text>

<Review>Great experience with the place. The staffs were just as friendly, knowledgeable as they can be. Can’t help but need to say that all the females staffs are just beautiful women. Rose the nurse, Diana in finance and Dr. Nguyen just beautiful. Wish I can come back with more visits but because they operation was so successful that I can only come back as needed.

They have been nothing but kind and helpful throughout my experience there. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is going to get lasik or is planning to get lasik. Great place to learn more information about your condition. Surgeons are super professional and kind will definitely recommend this place to my peers in the future.< /review>

The lasik vision institute at Huntington Beach is a wonderful facility. I’ve have nothing but positive experience here. The only regret I have is not having the surgery sooner this summer. I had my procedure at the end of July and I’m so glad to not be dependent on my glasses. I’ll come back for an update in 3 months once my vision is stabilized.< /text>

The staff at the Huntington Beach location are very patient, friendly,  informative, and great hospitality. When I came in last week for my consultation, I was a bit nervous and did not know what to expect. The doctors and staff answered every one of my questions and in a way made me feel comfortable and confident in getting the lasik surgery done. Its been a day since I got the lasik and I am happy to say I can see perfectly fine without my glasses!  Super grateful for the Huntington Beach Lasik Institution team! If you have been thinking about getting lasik, I highly recommend getting it done!<//Review>

One of the super best experiences I have ever had with an office staff and their Dr’s.  I went in not being able to see without my glasses and not seeing very well with my glasses anymore. When I walked in the first time I was welcomed with great energy. Everyone was super nice and friendly and they walked me through the process each time to make sure I was comfortable. They checked on me regularly and always gave me reminder calls which I love. The day I had my surgery Rose even said she would hold my hand during surgery if I needed it. Knowing she was there helped me stay calm.  Beverly wrapped me up after surgery and even helped walk me to my car to make sure I was all buckled up and told my husband to take care of me and to call her if we needed anything. Check up after surgery Rose, Beverly and the other staff memeber’s cheered me on my awesome progress. I was already able to see without needing glasses and able to see small text that I was not able to previously see at all. Thank you team so much for your hard work, your communication and your commitment to making sure my expectations and experience was 100%. I am sooooo happy I could cry. Thank you just isn’t good enough for the treatment I received.</Text>

I just had My Lasik surgery yesterday and when I woke this Morning, it was like seeing the world again for the very first time. Being able to have my vision corrected was the Best Decision I ever made. But choosing The LASIK Vision Institute®️ was my Greatest decision. The Staff is Amazing. I never felt more comfortable. Only thing I regret is not going to them sooner. - Louis P.<//Review>

They are very helpful with explaining the process and with the procedure itself. Dr. Bavand was my surgeon that did my eyes. It was very quick, he explained things very well and he made sure that I am comfortable while the surgery is going on. Dr. Nguyen was the one who checked my eyes pre op and post-op she was very patient with me, explained the procedure and she made sure that my eyes was healing very well. Beverly and Rose were the nurses that helped me and accommodated me through my surgery day and post-op appointments, they are both very helpful and very caring to the patients plus they are really happy for me and my eyes :) And last, Diana was the one who helped us with financial matters. She was very patient with us explaining the financial plans and she gave us a good amount of discount. Over all I recommend this hospital 100%! I will forever treasure my experience with them! And I for sure will continue to recommend them to my friends, family etc.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1572122478433, 'text': 'Thanks for the awesome review, Angeli De !

<Text>They have 5 stars for a reason! They make you feel like 5 stars when you are there. It’s been such a awesome experience. The procedure was a complete success, so professional but what made it so awesome was the staff. They are incredibly positive and fun. There is a vibe in there amongst the staff. A professional and fun atmosphere. They leave me with a smile on my face each time. Jonas is such a awesome person, very kind. Beverly is halarious. Rose makes you feel so welcomed. Itzel is a hoot! I can’t say enough good things.

Come here for your Lasik. No regrets</Text>< pictures>

< review>
My experience went very well. Both my husband and I had our surgeries here. We researched other facilities throughly and felt Huntington Beach Lasik was the best choice in Orange County. They provided us with great customer service, and the surgeon was very comforting during the operation. It really isn’t as scary as you think it is. If you plan on purchasing the groupon, I’d recommend doing the free consultation first.<//review>

<Text>They have 5 stars for a reason! They make you feel like 5 stars when you are there. It’s been such a awesome experience. The procedure was a complete success, so professional but what made it so awesome was the staff. They are incredibly positive and fun. There is a vibe in there amongst the staff. A professional and fun atmosphere. They leave me with a smile on my face each time. Jonas is such a awesome person, very kind. Beverly is halarious. Rose makes you feel so welcomed. Itzel is a hoot! I can’t say enough good things.

Come here for your Lasik. No regrets< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I had LASIK done in October the process was easy and fast recovery was fast on a mom to two little ones so a fast recovery time was a must. Although my vision is still a tad blurry because I have dry eyes the drs are very nice and have been keeping a close eye on me and sharing tips on how to help my eyes. I would highly recommend this place to everyone! Also, all of my follow up appointments since the surgery have been free so they can keep track of my eye sight.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>From the start when I came to my first appointment to see if I was a good candidate for lasik Ivonne & Jonas were super nice & extremely helpful. They were always answering my questions as they were  prepping me to see Dr. Nguyen. Dr. Nguyen was very comforting and patience with me, she examined my eyes and come to a conclusion that I was a great candidate for lasik. Then came Diana to explain the payment info and she was super sweet! And so yesterday I did my surgery and thanks to Dr. Bavand & Dr. Melikian I can see without my glasses!!! Today I can see so much better than I did yesterday 😊
Thank you Ivonne, Jonas, Diana, Rose, Beverly, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Melikian & Dr. Bavand!< /review>< response>

Just had Lasik completed by Dr. Bawand and would like to thank him for his kindness and amazing skills. You are blessed! I can see 20/20 vision now. I also would like to thank his staff at Lasik Vision Institute,  Beverly, Rose, Jason, Diana, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Melikias to name a few. The staff  are professional, kind, and answered all my questions appropriately.  I can't believe how pain free this procedure was and the following day I was back to reading without glasses.  I highly recommend Dr.Bawand, Dr. Melikias, and Dr. Nguyen for optimal work.< /review>

I cannot begin to describe the great experience I had at this location from the staff to the procedure itself.  Bev, Ivonne and Rose have been wonderful always atrentive since day one.  DR. Nguyen was very imformative about my eye health and post care.  Diane will answer any financing options into detail. Very helpful.  DR. Boward performed the surgery and through out the procedure he explained step by step what he was he was doing which made the experience smooth and comforting. Thank you to all the staff and doctors for making this life changing experience the best.< /text>

<review>I'm 35 years old and finally decided to make the call to Lasik Vision Institute after hearing how good lasik has been to people I work with. When I went in for my consult in Huntington Beach, Dr. Nguyen treated me very nicely and provided me with all the options and details I needed to make my informed decision. The only part was my concern on the cost and how I would be paying for it. Diana helped me with the financing. She made it very simple for me and set me up with zero interest via Care Credit. So, I had my lasik surgery on July 19. It was way better than what I thought it was going to be. Dr. Bavand made me feel comfortable and I did not feel a thing ( they provided plenty of numbing medication and sedative). Dr. Bavand let me know what he was doing every step of the way. I felt like I was under his surgical care in less than 10 minutes. I have had two follow up appointments and Rose checks me in and gets me ready to see Dr. Nguyen. Rose and Dr. Nguyen make it a pleasant visit answering all my questions and addressing what post follow up care I need to pay closer attention to. This office is very professional and clean. I remember reading how dry the eyes feel after having this surgery. I experienced super dry eyes the first couple of weeks along with light sensitivity during the day, and glare at night. I would use the drops as instructed, all day, and also would wear the dark eye shades( sunglasses) they provided me throughout the day, even at work on the computer. Now that I am 2 months post surgery, I use the drops 4-6 times a day, and wear my sunglasses when driving. I have no issues with glare at night. The eye drops they recommended are those daily use vials that I bought at Costco. They feel soo good. keep your eyes moist! Lots of Omega-3 people! If you are thinking about Lasik, I say go for it! Better now, than later. You can finance and make a monthly payment. Or put a couple of hundred down, and drop your payment. My surgery was just under $3600 for what my eyes needed. Everyone is different. Your consult should help determine what is right for you. Go online, you can see when they have special discounts. I also have VSP insurance which is who recommended me to these guys. Worth every penny!!!< /review>< user_id>

<Review>Lasik Vision Institute is the best! Customer service is 5+ stars.  I was extremely nervous to get this done and have been wanting to for years but the thought of surgery on my eyes was extremely frightful! The staff and doctor were so accommodating and helped put me at ease. It turned out my worries were for nothing. The surgery was quick and painless and I was able to see, albeit a blurry the first day, but next couple of days my sight was clear! It’s life changing to not have to wear glasses or contacts and have perfect vision. I was a -7.5 nearsighted, so normally I could not see clear more than 8 inches from my face! Truly greatfull for the office staff and everyone at this office.< /Review>< user_id>

<name>Aries franhens</name><review>Disclaimer: I had my surgery Oct. 2017.

I remember everything as it happened yesterday! I wanted to get the Lasik done for such a long time, but looking for the right Dr. To perform the procedure took me a long time to find. I seriously had  so many consultations with Doctors all over southern California but none ever felt right. It wasn't until I had my first consultation with Dr. Melikian and his amazing team! ( Dr. Nguyen , Beverly, Jonas and Rose) that I fell in love with the place and I knew I wanted to have my surgery with them. When I met with the doctor for the first time, I had a list of questions I asked every doctor I would meet, and Dr. Melik was super patient with me and my mom; answer; he every single question and  concern we had, was throughout and above all, he had the best attitude, bedside manners and he was just super super nice. The whole team was and has always been extremely nice and welcoming, which is something that almost never happens at  doctors offices.

The procedure
If you have been doing your research, you will know the procedure itself is very quick ( I recommend watching YouTube videos). On the day of the surgery they ask you to come dress comfortably, which I did, because after the procedure they are going to prescribe you a sedative(if I'm not mistaken) that will help with any pain and will help you sleep it off until the next day).  So you come in in the morning, they are going to make you watch a video of what's going to happen and what to expect after. The team will give you a care packet with eye wear you must wear for some good two weeks post lasik (to not accidentally rub your eyes when you sleep). A fter all the videos and explanations, I was super excited to start and to be honest I was not scared or nervous at all! but they will offer you and recommend you to take a relaxer pill. Which I did but I kinda regret taking because it obviously makes you Druggy and relaxed, but I just hate feeling of dizziness so this is a personal choice.
The procedure seriously lasts like 5 seconds each eye approximately. It's ridiculously short! It made me regret all the years it took me to made up my mind to get the surgery done. I walked in with blurry vision, and 5 minutes later I walked out ...well still with watery blurry vision but it was much better than before xD. I then walked out all happy and excited, took the medication to knock me out for the day and I slept the day away until the next morning.
I did not feel any pain at all, I don't know if that's usual but I had no pain , no headache and my eyes looked great! There was no sign that I had just had lasik done. I could see crystal clear! For the first time since I was 11 years old, I did not have to reach out to grab my glasses first thing when I woke up in the morning. It was so amazing, having HD vision, see signs that were fAr away ! It is seriously a life changing decision. I have no regrets up to this day! My eyes did end up being dry and I do have to use eye drops multiple times a day. If I stay too long without eye drops, I do get pretty bad headache. They say that normally it does away with time, but I just happen to have the bad luck that it has not. The doctor gives you alternatives, like eye plugs, which definitely help SOOOOO much! Look them up, they are very handy. It is really hard to live with dry eyes, but at the same time having great vision is so amazing and for me kinda worth the dryness.
Up to this date, I still visit Dr. Nguyen and Dr.Melik for follow ups to make sure my eyes health is still goodand Make sure my sight is clear and amazing. I am still really happy with the results, even though my eyes are really dry.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dd27f3686dfda9:0xbb8fd03b88448106<//gmap_id><user_id>113259038639884674775< /user_id><Rating>5</Rating></record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I have worn glasses and or contacts for close to 20 years. I was finally done with all that and I decided to get Lasik. Not only was The Lasik Vision Institute in HB highly recommend and they accepted my insurance. On my initial appointment Rose and Dr. Nguyen were the nicest and most helpful. They answered all my questions and took great care in making sure I was comfortable. On the day of my procedure Itzel and Diana kept the professionalism and care going. I don't remember the name of the Doctors that performed the procedure but they were very clear with what I was expected to go through and helped me stay calm during the uncomfortable parts. The procedure was quick and painless and Jonas helped me after until my ride home arrived.

The following day during my follow-up appointment everyone genuinely happy that I was excited and happy with my results. Blurry vision for 20 years and after one 10min procedure I'm 20/20 and I might get better as I heal. I can't say enough good things about everyone here. I will recommend anyone I know looking to get Lasik to come here< /text>< pics>

<Review>I was very nervous going into it, from the beginning. I found a Groupon for Lasik Institute and went for it.  From day one with my consultation the staff was very friendly and did not try to push anything on me.  They were very patient and answered any questions that I had. Even when I would call them randomly throughout the day. I am very happy with the over all service and procedure and service.  I would  Recommend to anyone who is thinking about lasik institute. It is the best decision I have made.<//Review>< GmapID>

I had been wanting to get lasik and get rid of my glasses for years and on April 16th I finally went for it. I was nervous at first, of course, but the staff is so informative and friendly that everything was so comfortable. I came for a candidacy check up first and scheduled my surgery promptly after. The day of the surgery I was given Valium to relax and numbing eye drops, then waited for the doctor. It literally took 10 seconds of lasering per eye and a good night sleep to change everything. Beverly walked me to my car where my ride was waiting because he thought it was going to take longer. The next day I came to my post-op appointment and I already had 20/20 vision and only minor discomfort due to dryness, which can be easily solved by following the doctors orders and using your drops. Today was my second week follow up and my eyes feel great and see perfect. Best decision I made for myself! Thanks HB family for being so professional and sweet!</Text>

<text>I had both eyes lazered in 2002; now, almost 15 yrs later and my vision is almost perfect at 20/25! I do have to wear "readers" but I never expected to have near perfect vision this many years later! Painless, some dryness that lasted for several weeks but did resolve. Highly recommend Global Eye & Laser!< /text>< pics>

The LASIK Vision Institute/Global Laser Vision is amazing!! It will be 1 year on April 6, 2018 that I had my LASIK surgery. Not only was my surgery a success, but my pre and post surgery was wonderful! The physicians & staff made me feel so comfortable through the whole process. The facility is very clean and everyone is extremely caring and so nice. If I ever have any questions or concerns, my answers are addressed immediately. I would highly recommend The LASIK Vision Institute/Global Laser Vision. I am so happy and thankful for everyone here!!!</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>The LASIK Vision Institute has given me one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff here is amazing. Everyone at the front desk and each assistant (Beverley, Itzel, Jonas, and Rosary) were incredibly friendly and approachable. Diana guided me throughout the entire process, keeping me informed and gave easy and clear instructions before and after my procedure as well as Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Melilzian (I hope I spelled that correctly). I hope I didn't miss anyone else who helped me throughout this process because I can't thank everyone enough for everything they've done. This was the best decision I have ever made and I would HIGHLY recommend anyone give The LASIK Vision Institute a chance if you have ever considered LASIK.</Text>< Response>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>What a learning experience.  From the very beginning I was concerned about having somebody work on my eyes with fear that something might go wrong. I went to several websites to look at reviews for the local Lasik clinics in the area and decided to move forward with The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach.

From the beginning to the day after surgery the whole experience with The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach has been great

The staff has been wonderful to work with and very professional.

In the beginning the consultation they gave me included a full eye exam to make sure that I was a good candidate for the procedure.  I was fitted with some contact lenses for the suggested Lasik procedure prescription.  I wore them for a few days to make sure that I was comfortable with the vision before moving forward. In my case i wanted them to fit me several times but once I was happy with what my vision would be they then scheduled the appointment to have the procedure completed (i was never rushed or pressured into making a decision).

The day of the procedure they have you come in to review the procedure and what to expect afterwards. They gave me a valium to calm me down.  The procedure itself took only a few minutes per eye.  There was no discomfort at all during the procedure.

Afterwards they gave me some Tylenol PM so that you could sleep through most of the discomfort expected afterwards. I woke up the next morning and things were a little  foggy but other than that everything was great (eyes were a little dry). I was able to drive myself to my follow-up appointment that morning.   The waiting room had several patients there that had driven themselves to their follow up appointment.  They have me setup for several follow up appointments for this coming year to make sure that everything continues to be a positive experience.

It couldn't have been any easier.

Thank you very much to the staff at The LASIK Vision Institute of Huntington Beach (I would mention names but I would be concerned that I left someone out).</Review><date>1553979348253<//date><response>None<//response>< userid>

I got PRK last year (exactly a year ago), and I am so glad I did! I've been able to enjoy the super bloom this spring, and also not have to keep on buying glasses every time my boyfriend sits on them!

The process was easy. My mom previously got her lasik here several years ago, and my dad also came to this office for lasik many many years ago. So I knew i wanted to come to this office for my eyes! My mom decided to gift me the gift of vision as my graduation present. So i made an appointment for a consultation, and a few weeks later, I came in and got the PRK done! During the surgery, the doctors are really good with keeping you relaxed and calm, and talk you through the WHOLE process every step of the way.  Healing time took awhile. Within two weeks, i was able to see clearer but it took about two months for my eyes to adjust completely. So if you're thinking about getting PRK, make sure you're able to get someone to take care of you for awhile (like driving) so you wont have to deal with being blind.  They also offer regular checkups to make sure your eyes are healing fine after the surgery.

The staff here are amazing! Evelyn and Jonas in the front are very helpful and always accommodating. Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Melikian are so nice and knowledgeable. Awesome office!</Review>

<Review>I’ve been considering LASIK for the last 10 years and never had the courage to do it. The LASIK Insitute at the Huntington Beach CA location made me feel so comfortable with moving forward in the decision to get LASIK. The staff are all incredibly friendly and there was hardly any wait times. After my 7 minute procedure, I woke up the next morning with 20/15 vision! I havent had any issues with side effects or major dry eyes. I’m so happy I finally got this done. I just wish I had done it years ago!<//Review>< resp>

Getting lasik is one of the best things I have ever done for myself! Especially choosing The The Lasik Vision Institute  to perform this gift of clear sight was the topper. I researched many places and came to choose The Lasik Vision Institute. From the very start, everyone was very accommodating and helpful. All of my questions were answered, even though I had many  and at length! I could call anytime with follow-up questions. Everything with my experience and my results went exactly as I was informed and I followed every instruction by the book. The results were amazing and continue to be! I still remember waking up the day after my surgery with clarity of sight that I never imagined was possible!
I look forward to continuing my regular check-up care here as I have grown to know the staff and even though I may be around only every year, they don't miss a beat in recalling exactly how I was doing and what I was up to last time I was in. It is truly a friendly/family-like atmosphere. There is not 1 thing extra I want for, The Lasik Vision Institute has it all!

In closing a big THANK YOU to the staff:
Diana - You were my first encounter/impression from day 1 when I walked in for my original consult. From that point on through, thanks for answering all of my questions and being so helpful and detailed with explanation of the procedure and finance when we got going. It is so much off of a patient's mind when we know we can move forward with confidence, peace-of-mind, and the comfortable feeling of knowing how approachable you are to resolving any questions big or small.
Dr. Melikian - You always have me in stitches - from laughing (not the bad kind) lol. Your sense of humor is off the charts! Thank you for also being so informative and descript on what I could expect from the procedure every step of the way for surgery and recovery. Your presence, expertise, and extremely helpful and caring approach, peppered with your amazing sense of humor totally "amputated" any nervousness I had lol "nervousness-ectomy." :-)
Dr. Nguyen -  I so much enjoy chatting with you in the course of follow-up visits. Your smile is so infectious, I can't help but leave with a smile on my face. Always so intuitive, thank you for always asking the right follow-up questions and keeping me honest with my follow-up care. You happen to answer questions I may have forgotten I wanted to ask, or questions that I was about to ask every time. I hope all is well and I am very much looking forward to touching base with you in next month's follow-up.
Beverly -  It is always a pleasure to come in for follow-ups and catch up with you first thing during the initial part of follow-up's. Your ability to recall what I was up to around my previous visit is remarkable. Coming in for follow-ups and seeing you is akin to visiting a long-time friend. I always look forward to coming back in to catch up with you.< /Text>

I proudly recommend GLOBAL LASER VISION.  I got my lasik  surgery  in 2001 and since then,  my vision is a 20/20.  Nothing has changed.  I used to be an On Air personality at the "LA ROMANTICA 96.7 FM radio in Orange County and will never regret saying YES to the proposal to have my surgery done here.  I'm glad you guys still around and of course it's because you guys rock on what you do!!.< /review>

<review>I love this place!!

Before deciding to get LASIK here I went to 2 other places and did a lot of research. My friend recommended me Global eye and Laser center because she was so happy with her LASIK surgery results!!! And I was not disappointed!!

The staff was amazing from Jonas, Diana and Itzel in the front desk and exam room, to Dr. Nyung who checked my eyes before and after surgery and Dr. Melikian was just so kind and careful during surgery!! They altogether are AWESOME!!

I usually get super anxious before any procedure but they provided me Valium and it helped a lot through the procedure, although I was a little bit drowsy everyone was super helpful and kind to me while I was on drugs lol and also off drugs... they were just AMAZING all Along!!!

After the surgery I had to come in the next day for a follow-up appointment and my eye was feeling a little bit uncomfortable. Together Dr. Nyung and Dr. Melikian looked at me and decided to put in a contact lens to make me more comfortable.... and it made me feel extremely comfortable.... (they took it out later during the week) I've been healing really good!

I can't stress how gentle and kind they were at this office!! I felt safe and In good professional hands at all Time. They were also very considered with my finances :) they even gave me coupons to save on my prescriptions and I saved almost $80! Lol

But the most important thing is..... I CAN SEE WITHOUT GLASSES!! 20/20 YAY!!!

Thank you so so much!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd27f3686dfda9:0xbb8fd03b88448106< /gmapID></record>

Love Big B. I went to Concord branch originally do to job locations and followed the great staff to Brentwood. I won't buy lumber from Home Depot or Lowes. Only Big B. They have the best material and the counter people can answer any questions you might have< /review>

It definitely has more variety of wood than your local home depot or Lowe's.  They seem to carry the lowest quality for outdoor trim work because 7 out of 10 times most of trim wood they have is warped or cracked.< /Text>

This was the absolute worst experience in a store ever the customer service was completely non existent. And not only that the staff was seriously below par they need to learn how to do their job. I will never shop here again.< /Review>

The staff here has always been very helpful. They are knowledgeable without being overbearing. I don't come often enough for them to know me by name but they always treat me like they do. A good, old-timey feel.</Review>

Great location and great store. Any kind of wood you may need, they've got it. Really friendly staff,  clean organized store, and great location.  They sell almost everything Ace Hardware does.</Review>

< Review>
The staff inside the store were very nice. Got outside and the gentleman waiting on Phil and I was very rude immediately as Phil was looking at the wood he had purchased to have cut. It got to the point where he said that if we didn't like the wood he gave us, to go back inside and get our money back. All of the other guys their are very nice to work with.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>Honestly the poorest quality customer experience I have ever received. I asked a lady at the counter to help me and she told me I should ask her co worker who was helping another customer. And then she continued to use her phone. Next the gentleman that was said to be able to help me refused to show me where product was located. He did not want to leave the desk to help me. I thought this place would be better than a home Depot or Lowe's, but regret not taking the longer drive down the street.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fff18ed743df7:0xe536c459b3a6386b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If your going to act like ashby lumber and emplement a " stop here for attendent to help you" out in the lumber yard then post the proper signs and road striping like Ashby lumber instead of getting on the customers.<//text>

Nope. Change in policies and high prices just drove me away from this location. Bought an led refit kit for $30 and it didn't work. Came back to the store and the cashier just pointed to a hand written sign which said no returns. If you have a faulty products then at least have good customer service.< /text>

My hair was so dry and damaged (I should've asked for a picture of my hair prior to her touch of art so you can see the game changer) . She withe her magic and my hair came back to life. She was very friendly,  patient,  and went above and beyond to provide such stunning results. Look at the pictures 😍💓 I definitely recommend her and she's indeed gained my trust and a lifetime client. She also specializes in blonde hair colors and much more.</Review>< Rating>

The place was cool and captivating. Also, the barber was relaxed and always greets customers with a smile. Honestly, he was thorough and a great conversationalist. When I already sit in his chair, he already knows what needs to be done and do the haircut perfectly. I greatly loved his way of doing the haircut. It was great!</text>

On Saturday, my dining companion and I went to this fantastic restaurant. Our expectations for the operation were exceeded. The staves were extremely friendly and accommodating. We'll return to this location. This is a fantastic concept. The food was delicious and tempting. Our dining experience at this establishment was genuinely outstanding in terms of overall quality.</Review>

It almost feels like going to a spa at the same time. Staff are courteous, the barbers are definitely skilled. They know what to do with your hair. I especially love how they take their time in styling your hair. The place is very accessible and has very spacious parking.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Great barbershop! I went in earlier today and had to leave before I could get my beard trimmed because of an appointment at work, but Scott told me to call him when I’m heading over, and he will get me in. He gave me an excellent beard trim. I will be returning for the full hair cut and beard trim often!<//text>

My 13 year old son asked his classmates where they got their cool hair cuts, and this where they sent him.  Very professional, well dressed, knowledge and polite!  And very affordable!  Our new favorite!</Text>

<Time>1577983655915< /Time><Rate>1</Rate><text>This barbershop was one of the first barber shops I went to when I first moved to California from Pennsylvania, and despite what I seen online about the barbers & barbershop I was highly disappointed. I got a haircut from a barber at this shop, and the barber nearly cut all of my facial hair off despite him not being told to do so. I even showed the barber an exact picture of how I wanted my haircut directly from the barbershop itself that is still posted online. Me being from Pennsylvania should show just how important our facial hair tends to be, and in this situation I almost lost it all. It still hasn’t grown back to the length it once was, but I guess that’s my fault for trying & trusting what I thought would be experts. The price I had to pay didn’t help either.< /text>< pictures>

15 year old insists on going here. Great attention to detail, good service. Appointment recommended... Walk-in can be a bit of a wait sometimes< /Review>

Knowing you can come out there with good cut is always a good feeling. All the guys here do good work usually go with Raymond or.    B-Ray</Text>

I set up an appointment days prior with Rey for 12:35. I walked in at 12:34. I was told that because “I wasn’t here on the dot” that he had to accept a walk-in before me.  Mind you he was still cutting another clients hair. I pulled my phone out to show him that I was on time, it read 12:34. It didn’t matter to him.   Poor service. I walked out.< /review>

I walked in 15 minutes before they closed at 3pm on sundays and wouldn’t take me. They said they were closed. Bummer because I rushed in there before they closed hoping to get service.<//Review>

Jose cuts my three year old's hair, has for over a year and a half, he does a great job and is very calm and easy for kids to listen to. I like my son's hair to have a parted and slicked over to one side fifties hair cut and Jose does a good job, it's always very neat and he listens to what i would like. There is a nice bank of chairs to sit and wait in and the bathroom is clean. I don't have a lot of barber shop experience being a woman, but it is very masculine and they always have sports on which my son enjoys, He seems to like the atmosphere a lot. It's a nice laid back place with generally happy barbers.  Waaaaaay better than taking my son to some supercuts or fantastic Sam's or something. It's also next to an ice cream shop if that's your thing and has good parking.</text>

< Review>
This farmers market is a nice size where you can get in and get out in about an hour give or take.  The variety of offerings is not the most robust I've seen, but the prices and choices that are available could probably fulfill ~85% of your general grocery needs.  The products too are generally quality and fresh, and the farmers are super accommodating with allowing use of your own reusable packing.  There is also a small selection of pre-prepared foods, baked goods, and even a fish monger type stall.

There's also a decent amount of parking available in lots and on streets that do not require pay, so bonus!</Review>

I missed the farmer's market and it was wonderful to see how they have incorporated the new rules to accommodate the vendors and customers. There are still food vendors which was exciting and delicious! Momos was a good addition.<//Text>

Absolutely the best Market I have been to in a long time. So many different vendors. Covid 19 recommendations were practiced throughout. The produce is delicious.</Review>

The staff was excellent and the facility was great! There is a good size parking lot and I didn't have to wait at all to get in and be seen by someone. You can even make an appointment online if you want. It's so nice to have such a quality option!</review>

Terrible service. Walk-in to get my blood pressure check. I was advise that they don't do it. I said Wow", what kind of service do you provide? I guess I had to pay to get it check. Drove down to the nearest Doctors on Duty and had it check. For Free too. What can we expect in a self-centered commercial system.<//text>

Fabulous facility. The staff is kind and caring and extremely knowledgeable. Sarah helped me find a specialist and got me an appointment in the same day.  We were so fortunate to find MoGo urgent care in Monterey while we were visiting. Gave us a great comfort level. Thank you.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>They are very expensive. And their fee doesn't make any sense. It takes the nurse to remove stitches less than 5 minutes and they charge a lot. In addition, the people who works in front they lack good customer service.

< Review>
I fractured my foot while hiking up at a nearby park. ER visit would cost me $2000, so I called MOGo and asked if they would see me. They said yes. Staff were super friendly and helpful throughout the entire office visit. They referred me to a Podiatrist who called me for an appointment the following day. Super happy my friend told me about MOGO. It’s my go to urgent care in Monterey.<//Review>

<date>1603243360464</date><rating>5</rating><text>Hands down the nicest urgent care I’ve ever been to. I made an appointment online and did not have to wait at all when I arrived. The staff was so friendly and helpful, they went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. The building itself was clean and sanitary but it had a very warm and welcoming atmosphere, not like a rigid hospital at all.< /text>< pictures>

Friendly, efficient and available excellent exam and follow up care. Primary physician is always booked up, Mogo is easy to get an appointment and complete report arrives on your doctors computer by the time you’re out the door. Impressive! And no waiting around with a bunch of sick people...< /review>

<Review>Everyone was knowledgeable and friendly.    I needed major cleaning and treatment because my 100# Goldendoodle created a 5 inch gash on my arm.   The staff did great.  My arm is much better.   Their facility is super clean.

Kim and Tara were amazing and super knowledgeable about my broken fibula! They were light hearted and made my broken bone feel special. I've already told my all friends about it the amazing customer experience MoGo offered and the up-front flat fee pricing. By far the best experience I've had at an urgent care facility! I had unusual demands that they readily agreed to and supplied me with expert data going forward.< /review>

<text>My husband went in to have a wound on the bottom of his eye, just above his cheek glued shut and the nurse practitioner ended up having his whole eye glued shut! Then she had to rip his eye open leaving him with an even more irritated eye and as she was trying to rip his eye open she was cussing and did not contain herself or handle the situation professional at all! Glue ended up in his hair. She didn't know how to open the tube of glue to begin with. She clearly had no idea what she was doing. We are very upset with the horrible care he received!</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1602863128185, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear about your experience.

Nice location but poor communication. I called to see if I could get a strep test and what the wait time would be, and was told there was no wait time. So, I rushed over just to be told by the receptionist (who I just spoke to) that they DO NOT perform strep tests due to covid. Doesn’t this seem like an important detail to mention?< /text>

Sunwest Painting provided the highest quality of craftsmanship to paint the exterior of our house, including window trim and stucco.
Sunwest had excellent, responsive communication throughout the project. Their family team was extremely patient and provided helpful counsel during the decision-making process of the project.
From start to finish, Sunwest offered extensive preparation work, high quality paint, and remained dedicated to their workmanship up to our final inspection.
Ultimately Sunwest Painting deserves a 5+ star rating for their project efficiency, safety compliance, and overall “Glow Up” of our home. Sunwest Painting is a family-owned business who takes pride in their work!< /Review>

Sunwest Painting have done three separate painting jobs for me now and each time I've been extremely pleased with the quality of their workmanship which is high praise from me because I'm a perfectionist!  Their workers are careful, courteous, and reliable ... if they say they will be at your house at 8.00 am they will be exactly on time. They are conscientious about protecting your home and spend the time needed to do the prep required for a good finish.  Luis Ponce always answers his cell or returns a call very promptly and is keen to keep customers satisfied.  If there are any concerns he's on it it right away.  Their prices are reasonable and their office seems to be run efficiently.  Estimates, contract agreements,  and payments can be quickly and easily done online.  I Highly recommend Sunwest Painting.< /review>

<text>Luis and his crew did an outstanding job on painting the exterior of my home. When we met with Luis, he listened to our concerns and made sure we got what we wanted. We had minor repairs to our home and he provided the repairs in the quote. He works collaboratively with the client and offers suggestions when asked. He explained step-by-step what would happen and then provided us a well written document that explains everything. The crew worked carefully to make sure the house was prepared for painting (repairs, power wash, scraping, sanding) before beginning painting. I felt comfortable in approaching painters with changes. The foreman, Guillermo, is a very nice man and aims to please! During the project, Luis checked the progress texting me each time he came out. Before deciding to go with Sunwest Painting, we got 5 quotes. The project price was not the lowest, but it wasn't the highest either. After seeing how hard this company works to please their customers and the excellent job they do, I believe the price was just right! I would highly recommend Sunwest Painting over any other painting company.</text>< Time>

I hired them to paint my living room with vaulted ceilings (20 ft) as well as the full exterior of my two-story house.

They even hung some custom shutters on the outside of the house after painting them. I had some scheduling issues around refinishing my living room hardwood floors that they were able to accommodate graciously.

Our house looks like new! Thank you, Sunwest Painting for paining our exteriors and brining our house into the 21 century! This was the most pleasant experience with a home improvement company we have ever had. They were always on time, considerate of property, great value for money and have our long term interests in mind at all times. They left the house and its surrounding in great condition and exuded expectations. Until Sunwest Painting I thought exceeding expectations is an urban myth. Highly recommend Sunwest Painting, if you want your home exterior painted. They do interiors, too, but I am writing only about what was our scope.<//review>

Very happy with the service I received from Sunwest Paiting. Luis was cordial, prompt in his replies (even outside of working hours), and friendly.  Carlos, the on-site associate, was very timely and repaired our drywall and textured the repair in a very short amount of time.

Sunwest also provided the lowest quote for the scope of work, and I was happy to see the quality of their work exceeded the price I paid. I will definitely seek out their services for future projects and repairs.< /review>

<response>None</response><text>Our house has wood sidings on the front of the house with varnish that is over 60 years old.  Over the decades, coatings of clear varnish was layered over the old varnish and it was starting to peel and become discolored with age.  The Sunwest Painting crew did a great job in removing all the old varnish and re-varnishing the house, and did the job in that terrible heatwave we had where it reached 100 degrees in mid August!  I know it was a very, very tough job removing all the layers of old varnish, but they got the job done.  I highly recommend Sunwest Painting for any painting job!< /text><name>Cray Foley< /name>< gmapID>

<Text>We had walls in the kitchen and bathrooms re-textured and all of the interior walls painted.  The kitchen and bathroom cabinets were refurbished and repainted to where they now look brand new.  Every member of the Sunwest team was extremely professional and no detail was left undone.  Perhaps just as importantly, they were genuinely nice and very conscientious people who took a great deal of pride in their work.  They always arrived when they said they would and made certain that they cleaned up everything before leaving each evening.

I highly recommend Alonso and his entire team at Sunwest Painting.  They're real pros and you could not go wrong by hiring them......< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

We highly recommend the Sunwest Painting Team for all your paintings needs. As a stucco contractor I've worked very well together. Luis and his Team are a great company for me to refer to my customers after we've installed new stucco for their home. If you want a high quality painting call Sunwest Painting.< /review>

<Text>This is a family owned and operated establishment that provides service far and beyond expectations. Every team member went out of their way to make sure the agreed job done right. Our experience with Sunwest Painting from quotation to finish was smooth and pleasant. We'd not hesitate to have Sunwest Painting to perform any painting projects for us and our family members in the future. Highly recommended!!!<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

Finally a contractor that is reliable, hard working, incredibly cost efficient and dedicated to the best of quality. I've been in the contracting field for over a decade and have even worked for painting subcontractors and I can honestly say Sunwest is by far the best. If Luis Ponce says something will get done. IT GETS DONE. Will be working with them exclusively from now on. Now if only more subcontractors would provide this level of quality and professionalism. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 15 out of 10 stars.</review>

Sunwest painting company is a wonderful company to work with. It is a family owned company. I dealt with both father and son, Alonso and Luis. Both extremely professional and helpful. The work was impeccable. Tony the foreman and his crew also were wonderful to work with. The main job I hired them for was to paint my 30 year old oak kitchen cabinets. I am so very pleased. They are gorgeous. I waited 6 months to write the review to see how they would hold up. They are doing fine. I just hired them again for a small job and another good experience. Their prices are very competitive.  For some reason I can't seem to post my before pictures but my cabinets were white oak with lots of grain and wear. Sunwest was able to completely fill in the grain and as stated above I waited to see if there was any bleed through. They did such a great job there was no discoloration or issues 6 months later. This was not an easy paint project.<//Text>

Sunwest painted our house recently and they did an excellent job. I am extremely happy with the job the painters did. When every thing was painted the last painter picked up what little debris was laying around and blew the dust off of the driveway. Sunwest paint job impressed my wife so much, that she trying to talk me into having Sunwest come back and paint the inside of the house.

I would most definitely recommend Sunwest Painting to anyone considering having their house painted</text>

I need it done ASAP so Luis was able to arrange around the schedule to accommodate my request.  The quote also was very competitive as well.  I highly recommend Sunwest Painting to do your drywall repair and paint job.  They also do handyman services and I plan to schedule for their services later for kitchen appliances installation.
Thanks to Luis team for the speedy response and good quality of the work that they did on my house.</Review>< pictures>

< review>
This review is long overdue. We hired Sunwest to paint our exterior house in the Summer last year. Reason why I am writing this review is because they have done a great job for us especially coming back to re-do the minor problem that we have two times after painting. Our front garage were starting to produce some bubbling effect after they painted our exterior house after about 3 months. Tony came to fix the problem and it was great after that. But after 3 months, other parts started bubble. I sent an email to Sunwest, and Luis was very efficient in replying my email and he quickly addressed my concerns. He told me that Corina will follow up with me to set a date to  fix the issue. After a couple of days, Corina managed to arrange Tony to come to get the bubbles problem fixed.  I have to say that Sunwest has been very attentive to our needs and you can trust them in handling the job well.  I want to also thank Rudy who started the painting job for us by doing all the preparation and for working till late to complete the painting on time.  The entire of Sunwest team has been a great and I will definately recommend them to our friends or hire them for future jobs.  Very professional service and I like the family own business where the workers are all hardworking and team work. They are also very prompt in their appointments and work on time.  Thank you Sunwest for getting everything done professionally.<//review>

<Review>I had these folks paint my long border fence which has lattice on the top all the way around, plus my spa deck and pergola. They were fast, absolutely excellent quality (even coverage, no gaps, no drips on the other (neighbor) side of the lattice) and professional - they covered everything including trees, gate attachments - anything that wasn’t supposed to be painted, was not painted. They even moved a portable storage unit I had against the fence and painted the fence behind it without me specifically asking them to do this. Their price is not the lowest, but you definitely get what you pay for. Owner is courteous & professional, overall great experience. I highly recommend this company.< /Review><Date>1539448376256</Date>< Rating>

Sunwest removed my popcorn ceilings last spring.  I was very pleased with their work.  A few months ago, 4 small cracks appeared in different areas.  Luis came out to look at the situation and had it repaired within a week.  His crew does a great job.<//Text>

< Review>
Got the 12+ year old fence repaired, powered washed, sanded and stained. The service was outstanding and result is marvelous. The old stain on the 300 ft long fence was solid maroon and became very inconsistent due to weathering. Stripping the solid stain and heavy mildew was no easy task. Originally, I thought that it had to be covered with an even darker semi-solid stain. After the treatment and power washing, it looked hopeful that the fence can take on a semi-transparent to show the beautiful wood grains. Luis took up the challenge: not only a semi-transparent stain, but also a very bright "cedar stain" from Armstrong. It took a lot of sanding to remove the remaining stubborn red stain in preparation and apply a second coat in certain areas to make up the differences in fence wood quality due to weathering. Now the fence looks new and boasts nice wood grains with consistent color across the yard.

Luis is the most thoughtful and responsive contractor manager that I have ever encountered. The initial inspection was meticulous and the estimate was detailed. He responded to questions and concerns very quickly. He is also very flexible with the schedule allowing time for rain to dry and us to decide on the color. His crew are very nice and care deeply about the quality of their work.< /Review>

This company is top notch.  Not only did they come in with the best bid, Luis has been great at walking me through the process and following up on every step.  They are very detailed in assessing your needs on your painting project.  They provide detail on the materials they use and even set me up with a free color consultation with their paint providers.  They offer a great warranty and are extremely professional.  I love the fact that they are a family owned local business.  I did a lot of shopping around but trust me when I say you can't get any better than these guys.  I'm recommending them to everyone I know.< /text>

I hired Sunwest Painting to paint my office and install some flooring and it looks perfect.  Luis and his team started working at 7am and worked quickly which tells me they have a great work ethic.  Also, they cleaned up everything after they finished which tells me they care about customer satisfaction.   Best part is, they chose the right kind of paint so that the office doesn't smell like paint which is one less thing to worry about.<//text>

Tony and the crew did a fantastic job of painting the exterior of my house. They also painted a bedroom and a ceiling inside the house. They always came on time and cleaned up before they left. When a couple of tiles broke on the roof when they painted the walls, they repaired the tiles with glue. Our entry door was in a bad shape with paint peeling off. Tony did an amazing job on the door. They also completed the job on time.
A few days after they completed the job, we noticed a loose tile and a couple of minor issues. Luis was very prompt in his replies. His men fixed the loose tile, while we were away.<//review>

<review>These guys were great, especially Luis. It's a family-owned business and their work was exceptional. I had a 1-bedroon condo that needed painting and they were able to complete it in a fast and efficient manner. They were available immediately and gave me the best estimate. I was able to move in immediately and they left the house clean.

I highly recommend their services and will definitely refer them to my family and friends. I will keep them in mind when I decide to remodel my garage.< /review><Gmap_id>0x808e2e2d9b590c8f:0x5fabde7229c665b4< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Very happy with the service I received from Sunwest Paiting. Luis was cordial, prompt in his replies (even outside of working hours), and friendly.  Carlos, the on-site associate, was very timely and repaired our drywall and textured the repair in a very short amount of time.

Sunwest also provided the lowest quote for the scope of work, and I was happy to see the quality of their work exceeded the price I paid. I will definitely seek out their services for future projects and repairs.<//review><gmapID>0x808e2e2d9b590c8f:0x5fabde7229c665b4<//gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< user>

<text>I have nothing but great things to say about this family owned painting buisiness.  Luis came and gave us an estimate on the job and the time it would take. During that conversation I asked him about some things we needed inside like ceilings, and making our tired stairs look new and interesting!!  Louis had great ideas and suggested colors and techniques.
I didn't know until the workers were on site that his father and sister also work with him.   The exterior of the home was finished in a matter of a few days.  The crew cleaned up every night and were very pleasant to work with.  They did a beautiful job and now a year or more later it still looks fresh and new!   The work that was done on the inside was also completed in good time and it turned out beautifully. They hung plastic throughout so the sanding wouldn't land up out of the work space Watching them do all the prep work around all the  spindles, sanding painting and sealing made me glad that I did not decide to do this job myself.  I love the finished refreshed and defined look.  They too cleaned up every night.  When the last tarp was loaded into the truck we looked around and not one drop of paint was on the carpet inside. Outside the driveway and patio area was clean and not one plant was broken. I can't thank them enough for the beautiful job!!<//text><UserId.>111228867502938342375<//UserId.>< Rate>

Luis gave me an estimate to paint a bedroom, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, living room, hallway, family room, doors, trims, crown molding, baseboards, remove a wall A/C, patch stucco, and patch various drywall areas. The estimate was itemized, very detailed, accurate, and reasonably priced. The crew arrived on time everyday and were very conscientious about protecting my furnishings. Overall, I'm very please with the quality of their work and professional attitude. I would hire them again.<//text>

<Review>I made a super quick decision to update our kitchen a few weeks before the holidays. Luis was one of four painters I met and got estimates from. He was on time and prefessional from day one and his estimate was the most competitive. His crew showed up on time every day and kept me informed about the progress each day. They took the time to mask all work area, even the entire garage. The paint job came out really nice and we are very happy with the color selection, thanks to Luis's suggestion.< /Review>< pics>

Due to a scheduling change on work being done in our home, I needed two rooms painted asap.  Called Sunwest and spoke to Luis.  It was a small job, but he was willing to fit us in, gave a fair price and completed the job in a timely manner, with no mess left behind.  Hope to use him again in the future.< /Review>

I have a vaulted ceiling that is 14 feet at it's highest point and a stairway that sits about 14 feet below the ceiling upstairs.I wanted to remove the old "popcorn" ceiling and decided it was too large a job to undertake myself.I called three different painting companies  to get an estimate to take down my ceiling. Luis from Sunwest  was the only contractor who actually took the time to come out to my residence and give me a quote. Luis was extremely personable and professional, he took the time to explain the process and answered all the questions my wife and I had without any pressure.The other two contractors I called requested that I send in photos and measure the dimensions myself. Sunwest was by far the most reasonable quote I received and I believe the other contractors bumped there prices because they didn't actually see the scope of work.  I called Luis to schedule the work to be done on the 5th of July but unexpectedly I had to change the date and Luis was more then accommodating. Carlos and Guillermo showed up at 8am on the 20th just as Luis told me. I can't say enough good things about the work these two did. They even moved some heavy furniture that I couldn't move and covered the one piece left. The first day they removed the old ceiling and prepped the drywall and applied  the texture. During the work operation the owner Alonso came out to make sure everything was going smoothly. The second day Guillermo and Alonso showed up on time and two coats of primer were applied and the ceiling was painted and all debris was vacuumed up and removed. The ceiling looks great and  I would recommend this family run business any day.</review>

I really don't understand the good reviews.

We used Sunwest after we were unable to book another painter because the person we were buying a house from was not willing to work with the other painter's schedule to give an estimate.  My husband booked Sunwest because they said that they could get the interior of our house painted in the 3 days in between the time we closed on the sale and moved in.  Sunwest didn't meet the timeline, tried to charge more than agreed upon, and the work was subpar as detailed below.

First, Sunwest tried to CHANGE THE AGREED-UPON PRICE.  Sunwest gave an estimate by phone.  I heard my husband describe the house, including the square footage, in his initial phone call with Luis (also, as the house was an active listing, this info and pictures were publicly available).  Luis said he knew the area of town of our house, didn't need to see the house, and provided a quote by phone.  We booked them based on that price.  Thereafter, each time my husband communicated with Luis, Luis would get the details of the job wrong.  He apparently did not write down any of the information.  Then, when Sunwest showed up for the job, Luis called my husband and said he would have to charge more because he thought the job was only half the size.  My husband said that wasn't right.  Ultimately, Luis did the job for the  agreed upon price; however, it added unnecessary drama to an already stressful time.  PLUS, Luis hadn't brought enough people for the job - meaning timing became an issue.

Second, the work they did was subpar.  We went from a yellow-beige to a gray wall color.  Not only can we still see the yellow-beige under the gray on some walls, but there is the gray color throughout the house on the white door/window trim, ceiling, cabinets, and hardwood floors.  There were areas where the paint was clumpy or ran where it was job applied poorly.  You can see a fine line of beige around all of the doors/windows as well.  THEY EVEN LEFT PAINT IN OUR TOILET AND SINK, AND CLOGGED THE SINK IN THE BATHROOMS WITH PAINT.

Third, they did not finish on-time.  As above, they did not finish on time because they didn't have enough people for the job.  This meant they rushed to finish while the movers were moving all of our stuff into the house.  It was a mess.

Fourth, Luis asked us to pay cash or by check.  When Luis's father showed up for the check, he asked me to make it payable to Luis personally - rather than Sunwest Painting - because "he took it as a side job."  This was so shady!

I showed Luis's father (who was wearing a company shirt and seems to work for the business) many of the problem areas.  He said he was surprised because "most of the crews are good." He also said that Luis would have someone come fix the problems; however, we have not heard from Luis.

Wish we would have gone with another company.</text>

The staff is friendly and helpful. I was a pack a day smoker until I tried their CERT45 “Tobacco Custard”. I was more than hesitant to try vaping but after a little encouragement from a friend I am so happy I did. I have not smoked a cigarette in 2 years thanks to these guys. Certainly there are other shops that have a wider selection.  The easiest analogy I can compare to is when I am looking for a car. When I want a “Mercedes” I do not want to see “Honda’s or Toyota’s” littered all over the place. I want the quality I expect and I can count on. For 2 years their products have been consistent and reasonably priced. Thanks Interstate!!!< /review>< Response>

This place is amazing! The workers were super nice and were able to help me with all my vape needs. The best part about it is that it's also a tattoo shop! The tattoo artist that was there was extremely helpful, I forgot his name but I'm pretty sure he goes by the name "Church"!
I definitely recommend this place for anything that has to do with e-cigs, capes, tattoos, and more.< /Review>

I might be a bit biased, but I love this place!  Selection is somewhat limited but this place is always full of amazing people.  I've had many good times and memorable conversations at Interstate Vape.  I met my wife there!  I've made many fantastic friends there, some of which I have changed my life.. So long as they're there I know that I'll keep coming back.  Also try the 365.  It's a butterscotch vanilla custard e-liquid that's beyond amazing!< /text>

Flavorful quality juices. I love ordering online. They offer great discounts and good variety. Only issue is they take a while to order. But their customer service is top notch! I reached out to inquire about my order and received a phone call from Ray, not sure if he's with interstate or West Coast Vape Supply, but he was incredibly friendly and made the wait worth it. I would strongly recommend this company to friends and family! Keep it up guys!</review>

The owner is a douche bag. Literally the most ignorant person I've ever met. Their products are clearly from fast tech and just marked up 200%. The staff was belittling a customer as soon as they walked out simply because their device wasn't up to date and they didn't want to buy one of their overpriced devices.
In the end, Save your money, support a shop that cares more about the industry than trying to strike oil.

I am an artist at the shop and I flew here from Baltimore to be part of this amazing group of people. Not only is it vapes and tattoos, but the also cater to and help recovering addicts from all over the country. Na and aa meetings are held 5 days a week.

<Review>Very helpful group here. I am new to the vape scene and walked in with a friend that has been vaping for a couple years now, and the staff helped me pick out parts and juice i wanted/needed to finish my set up with the current mod i bought a while ago. They took the time to help me out with any little issue and questions I had. Makes me want to come back again. Hope this helps anyone interested in this shop.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c29eb83131e5c7:0x7805cde596c4c1bd</gmapID></record>

<review>My experience at Interstate Vape was incredible. Alex was very helpful and knowledgeable about their vaporizers and went the extra mile to make sure I was happy with my purchase.  They have a fantastic selection of vaporizers.  Everything from super quality high end to a affordable starter kits. They also have a great variety of juices.  The vibe there is awesome and everyone is extremely friendly.  This is a great place to go if you are interested in learning more about vaping or if you've been doing it for a while and are sick of all the cheap Chinese made stuff out there that doesn't last long.  They also have a vaping bar in the back where you can sample flavors while listening to some music or watching a UFC fight.  It's an overall fantastic experience and a great local business to support.< /review><Name>DazzoPhoto< /Name><gmap_id>0x80c29eb83131e5c7:0x7805cde596c4c1bd< /gmap_id><Response>None</Response>< rating>

Sales person said car was SMOKE FREE but later I found an old cigarette hidden in the back seat cup holder. I didn’t say anything as they weren’t helpful the first time and just wanted to sell the car. My fault for not inspecting car closer at first but also shame on them for saying it was smoke free knowing the past owner was a smoker.</review>

I just want to say Ozzy at WASCO FAMILY AUTO , is the best car salesman I have ever dealt with. He wasn't pushy like most car salesman he was straight to the point and very polite I would recommend any my friends to come to DELANO FAMILY AUTO  and purchase a car.!👍🤗💯< /Review>

I also want to thank Chris who is the Sales Manager for making everything possible for us to drive home in our 2017 Honda Accord. That team at Delano Family Auto is the best I've ever seen.

They were informative when we needed to remember to but a little insurance in case something happened. They went through everything step by step and got us a unit size we wanted and didn’t try to upsell. I will highly recommend this place to my neighbors and friends who find themselves needing a place for their “stuff”.<//text></record>

Great experience with customer service over the phone as well as in store. The unit was clean and the property is easy to access once you have the pin for the security gate.< /Text>

Tammie helped me to get this storage from start to finish in 5 minutes. Yes, 5 minutes took me to sign everything over the phone.
I’m so happy I found this place. Headache free storage and all kind of supplies also available right there in the office for purchase. Very safe and quiet place.
Thank you very much guys.

I want you all to know I just experienced one of the Best Customer Service experiences I’ve ever had.

We are relocating to another state and needed to clear out our storage unit. Tammie was so sweet and caring taking care of us on a Sunday afternoon. They even sell all the moving supplies you need at a competitive price.

I highly recommend this location for your storage needs and ask for Tammie.

Thank you Tammie.</review>

In my perspective of knowing Ms. Tammie Geter I find her to be compassionate, caring person. Ms. Geter understands the importance of helping people so they can get the best part of their needs met. Ms. Geter is the example of an employee any corporate need to have.<//Text>

<Review>Thank God for Tammie! I can’t say enough great things about the level of customer service she provided me today. I was harried, panicked, with movers and all my earthly belongings in a rental truck...pulled up to my new unit at 6:00 (when the office closes) - only to find my unit was locked!  Tammie stayed after to make sure I was taken care of. If I could give her ten stars, I would. As a working professional, I’d recommend Extra Space put Tammie Geter on the fast track to leading the corporate QUALITY training program.< /Review><response>{'time': 1598721575848, 'text': 'Hi Ginger, Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback!

<Text>DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR POSSESSIONS. Amending my original review. Initially, the staff was super helpful and gave us a good deal. HOWEVER. About 10 months into our contract, our storage unit was broken into TWICE in a single day. The entire process has been a nightmare. The employees were disinterested and unhelpful in every way, even though at least 3 other units were robbed on the same day. They did not respond to police requests for security camera footage. Footage was requested multiple times and they NEVER handed it over. They weren't apologetic in the least. My partner and I are low-income and EVERY VALUABLE THING WE OWNED was taken from us. Extra Space didn't bat an eye. They couldn't have cared less. The break-in happened almost 6 months ago and we have yet to receive any compensation (granted this is the fault of the insurance company, but it was delayed because Extra Space was uncooperative). We cancelled our lease as soon as the contract was up. NOT TO MENTION they raised our rates only WEEKS after the break-in happened after being assured they would not go up. Also the gate is broken half the time and security is a joke. LOOK ELSWARE. If they give you a deal it's because they're desperate. Don't take it.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

I was lost on the web when I clicked something else that took me to Extra Space.  I hung up & tried again because I thought it was my fault.  She was friendly so I decided to check it out anyway.   What a happy glitch!  A few phone calls and, between Kristina & Johnny, all my storage needs were met.  Professional & efficient but fun & funny at the same time!  Sold!!!  Space reserved & held a few days til i could get there.  In their follow-up calls I felt no pressure.  When I went to do the paperwork the laughter continued.  Another reviewer mentioned feeling like family.  I felt like an old friend & I know this will be a great experience for me.  Thanks for making it easy and very welcoming!< /review>

We looked at a couple sizes to determine the right layout for storing my sectional. They were both clean. I went with the 10'x10' as it was an internal unit and was much cooler than the exterior. I bought my own lock, moving carpet & plastic sheeting to cover the sectional. When it sold & it was time to be removed, Kristina was also helpful in offering a dolly & made sure the buyers/visitors had an easy exit (she kept the gate open and stayed since my gate code became void after checking out).

<name>Victoria Nesseth< /name><rating>5</rating><date>1594591264000</date><review>I have never needed a storage facility untill recently and Extra Space Storage was recommended by several people  local to the area. I was completely unsure of what to expect, however, their employeeJohnny made the process easier then I could have hoped . My belongings were comming in a semi truck,  so I needed a unit that I could drive up to to empty the trailer. Extra Space Storage was one of the only facilities able to accommodate this. They have a code controlled entry exit point, as well as 24 hr on-site staff. There are many size units available, and many opportunities for discounts and reduced cost among those choices. Johnny was versed in his inventory and simplified my needs to the few units and cost I was in search of. My  unit is a larger, three door unit, accessible from both isles. One large rolling door on one side, two regular doors on the other. You need to bring or purchase locks for all doors. The unit was clean and well kept. I feel safe and secure that my belongings will be will be kept Safe, dry, clean, and accessible for the duration of my storage. I highly recommend and rate Extra Space Storage in Rancho Cordova for your storage needs.< /review><UserId.>111807689060555547620</UserId.><gmap_id>0x809ae7844f4baa1b:0x321907b3b3b19fcc<//gmap_id></record>

Moving is always hard and no fun. I was under pressure and needed space quickly. Christina made my check in relaxing and just by her willingness to put up with my time crunch and frustration someone with those traits alone is worthy of a 5 star rating. Thanks extra storage for putting someone in a position to give good customer service as well as a great personality dealing with the pressure endured by a customer.< /text>

He took the time to understand what I needed, make sure my reservation was set, and go over the next steps with me. I was able to do a remote contract and he even followed up with a phone call to let me know all had gone through.
I'm hoping the rest of my time with Extra Space Storage is the same.

<Review>Johnny and Kristina saved our lives! We were in a bind as the escrow of our new home did not close on time. We still had to move out of the sold  house. We walked into Extra Space Storage, one hour before closing, and these 2 could not have been nicer. They figured out the most economical way we could store our whole houseful of stuff, short term. This was a huge relief! Thanks guys! I wholeheartedly recommend Extra Space Storage.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1561576698955, 'text': "Thank you for the kind words, Jody.

Gate constantly does not open. Code is accepted and displays "access granted" but gate does not budge. Have to wait until office opens in order for them to manually open gate. This issue probably won't impact someone that doesn't need access past 9 am but for someone like myself that keeps equipment and materials here that are used to make a living it has been incredibly impactful and has caused a loss of income.</text>

I was moving to the area recently and I hate the process of moving, particularly deciding where I feel like I can keep my items secure for a fair price. Kristina is the manager here made it an obvious choice for me, I can tell she genuinely cares about the safety and cleanliness of her facility and I know I can sleep at night knowing my items are secure. The place is well lit at night and Kristina lives on the property! It's clear to me that when it comes to storing, it doesn't get much better than this. Thank you Kristina!!<//review>

I was looking for a place to store some items at a good price. I called around to a few storage companies and they were too pricy or not in a safe area. At last, I called the very last the last number in my search and found this place. Rubin was such a delight and professional. He quickly answered all my questions, reviewed the paperwork and was very informative about the storage units. Adrian was very pleasant and extremely helpful. She provided some guidance and tips on making storage work best to suit my needs. She is also very familiar with the area which is a relief. The place smelled wonderful. Very clean and most of the people that came in and out of that place were so friendly. I truly feel I got my money's worth as I'm getting great service, amazing attitudes and much needed storage place. Thank y'all so much!👐😁😄< /review>

Jennifer & Carrie are so professional, friendly and courteous!!! Best customer service I’ve ever experienced by far and I have rented a lot of storage units over the time. Their rates beat any others in the Sacramento area! Amazing experience and I will refer them to anyone! Thanks again ladies for such a smooth process!</Review>

<Review>I am on crunch time to move to a beautiful new city in Oregon from Rancho Cordova Ca and needed to get a storage unit for my entire house. Stress to the max I reached out to this company because not only did they have the cheapest rates but they also offer first month free. I spoke to a man named Johnny Forge’t and he is an absolute angel! He helped us like he was driven to put our needs first. Thank you so much for making this chaotic time that much easier. You are the best! I Will definitely be spreading the word of how great you make this company!!!</Review></record>

Reuben was absolutely awesome. We just moved to CA from TN and ended up having to put our things in storage for a short time. Reuben was awesome trying to help us find the exact right size of storage unit, very fast with everything and possibly the friendliest person we have encountered in CA so far. The unit was exactly what we wanted/needed. It was great to have an option of a very large unit. The facilities were clean and the gate has not had any issues. Also had no problem getting our 26' truck around the grounds. Thanks again!<//review>

Reuben & Adrienne are awesome! Such a sigh of relief to deal with such great customer service from these two working at Extra Space Storage. These two made us feel at ease right when we stepped through the door, answering all of our questions thoroughly with a genuine smile. Couldn't ask for a better experience. Thanks again you guys!</Review>

<Text>Reuben and Jessica were truly amazing! It was a such great service experience from start to finish!

I set up the reservation online and was immediately contacted by a representative that was super helpful and nice. Not too long after that I received a call from Reuben to set up a time to come look at the unit and pay. When I got there they were super friendly! I was a little unsure of how much space I was going to need, but Rueben really worked with me to decide what size would be best. I ended up choosing one unit size larger and am so glad that I did!

The facility was very clean and has nice wide driveways. I've had storage units in the past and this is the best experience I've had!</Text><user_id>101578956416553853023<//user_id><Date>1490477538448</Date><gmap_id>0x809ae7844f4baa1b:0x321907b3b3b19fcc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience at Extra Space Storage. My son attends Sac State and needed a place to park a large SUV over the summer. The rent to store it was very reasonable. Other storage place wanted two or threes times more just to park this vehicle in a outdoor lot. The process to rent the space was quick and easy. Making payments online was easy too. I can not say enough good thing about the staff. They were so helpful and friendly from the time we dropped off the car to the time I picked it up. When I went to pick it up after two months it would not start. The staff working on July 29th really went above and beyond to help me. Before I could call roadside service, they were out there with jumper cables to give me a jump start. Thank guys!< /text>

<text>First time renting from them. It was fast and very friendly. Grounds were clean and so was the space I rented. Best of all, it is open later than other places. Highly recommend them.<//text>< username>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This location is great right next to the freeway and easy access. We can come to our storage room anytime because its so easily accessible. The rooms are great we got a 10 x 30. They just repaved the road which is really nice and the staff especially Andres who was such a great help during our moving process they also let you use the their truck for move in. Wouldn't think of using a different location this place is perfect<//text>< pics>

I came in just shopping prices, which are great at this site, but the service was what really sold me!
The two gentlemen in the office really care about their customers and their storage facility.
They helped me pick a perfectly sized unit, which was very clean and easy to access. I'm very satisfied with my experience. :)</Text>

I'm going through a difficult divorce and needed to find someplace quick (and affordable!) to store my stuff while I'm between residences. Not only was the price right, Reuben and Jessica are so pleasant to work. This was the only place I visited that made me feel comfortable about storing my belongings. I highly recommend Extra Space Storage in Rancho Cordova.< /Text>

Christina helped me sign up for a storage unit today. She was great. She is a kind, calm, trusting and gracious woman. Extra Space Storage had the best price in the Sacramento area PLUS they had a 14 foot truck I got to use for free, gas not included.<//review>

< Review>
Had an excellent experience here and all my questions were answered.  The associate Andres Knowlton made me feel welcome and was extremely personable.  Having a bad experience in the past I was skeptical but Andres took good care of me and made me feel very comfortable through the whole process.  I found the location to be the most competitive in pricing as well.  I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage and will continue to do business with them in the future.< /Review>

This is the best place to rent storage space from.  Very friendly and accommodating staff, they went out of their way to help me out multiple times. Also have very long gate hours (7am to 10pm) and a truck you can use once to help you move.<//text>

Found this place online. They were a lot cheaper than Public Storage or any of the other storage places in town. We got the unit we wanted, at the price we wanted. We have worked with a single point of contact (Andres) and that has been great. He's very professional and helpful...and really made the experience painless.<//text>

I can say unequivocally that extra space is the best storage company I have ever dealt with. And as far as Ruben is concerned the management this particular office he is the bomb. He is Johnny on the spot when you need something always there to prevent something from happening always thinking ahead and by far professional and courteous a great face for the company. I could go on and on but why just use this facility and you will be happy!< /review>< Pics>

One would think that like most storage places, customer service would be non-existent here, but  surprisingly the two individuals who work here go above and beyond to make sure that not only are you satisfied with their storage facility but also understand what you're signing up for.

The two guys I worked with were named either Andreas or Andre, and Brian, I can't recall the spelling of their names.    The way they greeted me was fairly refreshing, as I was treated more like a friend than just another customer.  They went over all the details with me, and helped make my move with them as smooth as possible.

I would 100% recommend this facility over any,  if only other businesses would go out of their way to look after their customer base, looking at you Wal-Mart!.

We had such an amazing time working with extra space storage

Rueben and Jessica were two of the most amazing people to ever work with!!

They actually brought us cold waters to our storage knowing would be there all day

Gravis a great deal to move into a new size unit

This is by far the best experience I've ever had with any storage place and believe me at there have been some nightmare situations in the past but not here at extra space storage they're the best!!

Thanks

<review>Service was as expected. Moved in back in Feb '12 and out in Aug '13 They had a free truck to use for move in and I ran over the allotted free time limit but since no one was scheduled to use it after me they didn't charge me for it. It's great to know a business can be accommodating and friendly. The move out was as easy as picking up my stuff and leaving. During their AM lock-check they noticed mine was locked anymore and called me. Just let them know I didn't need it anymore and they took me off autobill and closed me out. With moving and all other things to do, the added level of service was refreshing. I'll use them again if the need arises.< /review>< Pictures>

We had such an amazing time working with extra space storage

Rueben and Jessica were two of the most amazing people to ever work with!!

They actually brought us cold waters to our storage knowing would be there all day

Gravis a great deal to move into a new size unit

This is by far the best experience I've ever had with any storage place and believe me at there have been some nightmare situations in the past but not here at extra space storage they're the best!!

Thanks

<Review>Andreas went so far beyond customer service tonight it made my head spin! His place did not have the size unit I needed ( he is very near capacity), but he truely wanted to help us. He searched for a nieghboring facility without us even mentioning it. We also needed a truck. Again he personally did not have his available, but (without the slightest hesitation) searched for a local truck. He even had a code that gave us a discount on the truck. We discused extended stay motel lodging and he had that answer as well. We thanked him for being so generous with his knowledge and connections and parted company. As we were leaving wegot a call and pulled back in the parking space to take it. As we were on the phone he came out and handed me a piece of paper with more notes about extended stay motels inthe area. ANDREAS , YOU SIR  HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!

Thank you,

Quiet area, clean facility, and staffed for a good portion of the day. They're a little on the expensive side though.< /Text>
