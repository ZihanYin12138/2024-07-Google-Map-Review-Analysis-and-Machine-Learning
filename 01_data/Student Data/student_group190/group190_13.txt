Bad customer service experience! I called and they hung on me! I called again and the lady told me to hold so I did. I was on hold for like 15 mins while I could hear the lady taking orders for like 15 minutes. She took so long I was actually able to get to the fish store by that time defeating the purpose of the phone order. So as I pull up to park the lady just clicks on me again. So I go inside to order but as I walk up to order the first thing the lady tells me is “Hold on I’m going to take this phone order” -_-< /review>

I been here once a week since I first came three weeks ago. The fish and chicken are delicious, the oil is fresh......you can always tell when a restaurant changes their frying oil often. This place is legit. The food was a always an point and the customer service is always welcoming and friendly< /Text>

< Review>
I have a fish place near by that I have been going to for many many years. I decided to try a new place (same zip code). I initially was going to do door dash but when I realized how close they were I decided to just drive lol and I was happily surprised. I would say the flavors were better than my normal place. My only complaint would be my preference of  well done. Sometimes you have to try new places.. they even have a rewards card so being loyal to them actually pays off! And the parking situation is better. Also, the young lady that was helping me ( I did not get her name 05/17/19 afternoon) was polite and professional. I have included pictures<//Review>

<Text>Okay.. I never got a chance to come back and update my previous review which was under Deanna B..I did go to visit them that same day. They open at 1030. I got there by 1040 and when I walked in the cases were empty there was not a single fish on display which immediately put me on alert. I'm not sure what was going on, but it looked to me that maybe the refrigeration on the case maybe had stopped working. I yelled a couple times to see if a clerk was around, he finally comes out the back and I asked him where was the fish. He then tried to assure me that he had fish, just tell him what I wanted and he'll make it now. I just didn't feel cool about ordering something I cant even see first. At that moment, another customer came in and saw the empty case and said he wasnt going to eat it either once he saw the case. Now in now way, I'm saying anything was wrong with your fish, but maybe in the future you can have your displays set up before a customer arrives, so that we won't be scared off from trying it. I ended up going to another place across town that the customer suggested.</Text>< pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1570745855118, 'text': 'Thank you for your review Dee. We\'re sorry that your visit to our restaurant wasn\'t a pleasant one. Yes, we do open at 10:30AM Mondays-Fridays and 11:00AM on Saturdays. Yes, we should have been fully prepared for business before 10:30AM, however, we failed to do so that day at that time. This, we apologize for. However, please be advised that this isn\'t always the case. Our fish is out on display EVERYDAY so, as you said, our customers can see what they\'re ordering. With that said, we\'re 100% certain that our fish was displayed AFTER your visit. The reason why you had to "yell" for attention was probably because we were preparing the ice to display our fish on. We will do our best to be fully prepared for business prior to our opening hours. Thank you.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

I haven't  visited the store  yet, but I did want to try a new fish place, so I decided to check out the reviews.. I am sometimes iffy about trying new fish places, and I stick with 3 , however most dont open till 11am around here.

What sold me on trying this place was the owner's professional response to criticism. I really admire that, so I intend to revisit them based on that! That shows a lot to me..

Anyway dont judge the 3 stars, I just had to put something in order to write a review. I will adjust it after I go there..

By the way, I used to eat here maybe 15 or 20 years ago I believe. Back then they were good, so I need to see the improvement.<//text>

<user_id>109769438811271514033</user_id><review>Got red snapper, my favorite but not from this place.  Rubbery and not fresh testing at all.  The prices are terrible, but they have this one flavor of Arizona I like so I stop by on my way home to grab one.  I notice they had av small container of cream cheese randomly in the fridge with the drinks for $3  I watched as it expired and brought it to their attention.  The thing is they just see the community as desperate people who will eventually buy anything so they would rather let something expire for 3 times it's value than share any opportunity with the community.  If you want fried fish or chicken their are two other far superior places just south of this location.</review>< gmapID>

<Resp>{'time': 1540444562919, 'text': 'Jordan, thank you for sharing your opinion with us. First, we apologize for the "rubbery and not fresh" fish. We always strive to provide the best kind of fish to our customers, but we will explore more options. Second, thank you again for bringing the expired cream cheese to our attention. We had it marked down on our calendar but failed to take it out of the shelf 1 day before you have spotted it for us (The day you visited us was Monday, 10/22/18). We are deeply sorry and we will never let this happen again. We want to also add that the price of the item (same brand and size) is the same at Walmart, Target, Vons, etc. We learn what our mistakes are from our customers\' comments and try to fix them at the best of our abilities, so we review them very carefully. However, there was one thing we wanted to make clear because it was misleading. We DO NOT "see the community as desperate people". If anything, WE are the desperate ones. We go out of ours ways to impress our customers with affordable, yet delicious food so they will return to our store. We love the people of Long Beach and the area, hence, that\'s the reason why we decided to start our business here. We provide everyone with the same type of customer service and we never make judgements. We are thankful for your review, however, we would like to politely ask you to not make misleading assumptions. Thank you.'}< /Resp><Name>jordan carr<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Surprisingly gold.  Fish and chicken were fried to order.  Fish looked fresh.  Spicy Chicken was sublime.< /Review>

I Flippin love this place! Ive been coming here for YEARS! To be honest i dont even like fish but these guys fried catfish is the bomb its really good and thats coming from a person that dosent like sea food lol. If your around the area i reccomend getting the 5 or 7 pieace fried catfish pieaces, it comes with the fries like a combo. Its like 8-10 bucks but its definitely worth :D<//Review>

Please be advised that our chicken and fish are fresh, and made to order so they tend to be more in price compared to other major fast food restaurants.

Treehouse is my favorite smoke shop. Every time I come in I'm greeted with a smile by either Drew or Chris. They always have top quality glass for very reasonable prices. I regularly go in for all my rolling needs and my girlfriend gets CBD products to help with migraines. Truly, truly my favorite smoke shop!!!<//Review>

My third visit to treehouse and the place is excellent! My first visit was just to look around and my second was for a purchase of a bio brand water pipe. My third (today) was for a replacement pipe bowl and the owner was available to help find a new 14mm bowl for me.

We spent a good 10 minutes looking over and comparing bowls until we found a good match that I liked. The prices are very reasonable and I am really pleased with the service and friendly atmosphere. Definitely worth stopping by.</text>

<review>I went in to replace a bong that broke. There are so many different options that I picked a few out and Drew helped me narrow down which one to get. He was patient and told me some pros and cons of each. I ended up with the Bio Bullet which was the 2nd cheapest of the 3 options. I appreciate not always being up-sold to something more expensive.</review>< pics>

<review>My name is Erik and my experience in this shop was very pleasant and i highly recommend the Treehouse. They have a large selection of top shelf glass to choose from. All types of name brand dab rigs and bongs.   The employee was helpful. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Very high quality glass.</review>< Pictures>

I love this place, my friends and I come here to hookah and hang out. Everything is priced extremely fair, this is the only smoke shop I give my business to now. It is a great place to hang out, it has comfortable seating along with sizable hookah areas so you are not clustered close to other patrons.<//Review>

I've been to their front door multiple times. They aren't ever open. I guess that's what happens with head shops. Once I did end up inside, very friendly atmosphere and helpful employees there to help find what you are looking for.< /Review>

<Date>1495685593578< /Date><Review>Amazing place.. Stopped by looking for Vape supplies. Once I found out they were phasing that out, I couldn't help but jump at the deal for a new tank. Clean shop, great staff. I'm terrible with names.. But the guys today rock! Looking for a new Vape Mod, Tank, or juice??? Hit these guys up.. Fast!!< /Review>< Rating>

< Review>
He's amazing, it's been 5 weeks since I had done root canal & crown one of my left lower jaw 🦷, he did amazing job, and I made sure , he does it perfectly fine, keep telling your dentist, until you don't feel anything new. I waited for review and now I can honestly recommend him to anyone, plus his price was much better than Western Dental. 👌👌< /Review>

Can’t say this has been the best dentist I’ve been too, but one I can afford now. Be cautious this is a learning dentistry business and many mistake may happen on their end.

The dentist, ortho, and assistants customer service between 1-5 is a solid 3 in this location; dentist doesn’t communicate with the patient what he is doing in your mouth or what he has found, leaves it to the assistant to attend to discuss it with the patient. But when I asked, she didn’t even know and then told me to ask the dentist when he returns(which he didn’t). A different dentist comes in and tells me what is going on and what I may need to do. Super communicative, I was then left with a calm conscious.
The reason I give it a 2 is because of front desk;
I was on my way out and was told by the assistant i had to meet someone to go over some questions i had, when I then over heard the front desk making statements of patients they dealt with and how they hated it and then awkwardly walking to the front after using the restroom to get information and pricing on some dental work when someone just walked in front of me and told me if I needed a pricing on something-I had no idea of what she was talking at first on how taken by surprise i was-and then ended the conversation with “thank you”. I then responded with “I will call to make an appointment and of questions I have regarding what I needs to know” and she responded with “mhmm have a good day” as she sat.

I don’t know how you meet someone without introducing yourself first and then asking the patient if they had any questions/concerns about pricing of the dental work that had been done or needs to be done. I left so confused and felt dismissed as if I wasn’t supposed to be there. A little unwelcoming on their end.

Kind of surprised their really isn’t bad reviews- but you won’t know if you don’t try it out. I’d just say to do more research on places like these. Their are other places you can check for more reviews.<//review>

I had the best experience here. I was so nervous as so many others are about the dentist. Well the dentist Anas Alkwadri was awesome. I’ll be referring everyone. No hidden fees and if you receive Medi-cal so many things are covered with no out of pocket cost. All the staff were very warm and welcoming. No pressure at all for any necessary services needed.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My name is Dan Sverdlin. I had a root canal done recently at Far West. This was at a time when most places are closed. The tooth had been authorized by Dentical about a year ago at Western Dental but their sugeon was unable to a root canal due to size and shape( i was told). He cleaned out the space and filed tooth. When i got a toothache in it recently Western seemed disinterested so i went to FarWest which rapidly got authorized by Dentical. They were able to do the job that Western had been unable to do. I could not be more pleased with them.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Farwest Dental Group has absolutely the best staff and doctors in So Cal, Dr Fayoumi is such a caring doctor with his patients. Both of my daughters were seen at this office, the wait is minimum the staff greets you with a lot of care and most importantly make you feel welcome. What can I say nothing better than staff that explain any treatment needed for your children 😁 Thank you Dr Fayoumi for being awesome! I highly recommend this office for anyone looking for a perfect smile 👍<//Text>< userid>

This is the best Dentist ever they are so professional, friendly, affordable and thorough with a clean environment they the get the work done. They saved my front teeth and I needed alot of work done.  I'm extremely pleased being that I'm a person that did not like the dentist but they make you feel comfortable and the whole staff including the dentist are caring. I love coming here my teeth are pleasantly pleased and so am I keep up the good work I would prefer them to anybody this is my dentist from now on. I recommend you let them give you the smile I have now. Thank you Farwest Dental.<//Review>

I truly love this place! First time me and my family go there, all employees are very welcoming and nice! My husband was playing around saying some coffee would be nice and they actually gave him a cup, some nice nurse put Netflix on the waiting room for my kids to watch and asked what they wanted to see. Dr F.. was so great with my daughter and sweet, 1st time getting work done on her and the other employees were sweet as well. Love the service and I sure do recommend it . Great experience my daughter said  "they were so nice " to her.<//review>

Great Dentist! I live in Anaheim and willing to drive to this clinic despite traffic and distance! Dr. Fayoumi is a professional dentist, his assistants and staff are great too! Highly recommended!</Text>

Far west dental group is hands down the best in the south Bay Area. Dr Anas Alkwadri, D.D.S and his staff are so kind and compassionate with every patient. Having a tooth problem call them..<//text>

So, I bought an xray, exam, and cleaning coupon on Groupon. I have done this before. Every single time (I've been going to the dentist twice a year since I had teeth) I've ever gotten a cleaning, it's been the scraping with the hooks (plaque removal) and then the polish. Every time. I get here and they say plaque removal is an extra $50. Now, I wasn't necessarily unwilling to pay more, but I didn't have the money with me at the time, and I was assuming they were going to do a full cleaning. They should have made that clear. They also should not have let me wait 45 minutes in the waiting room and another half hour in the exam room. Very strange pricing system, and it's not in the best area.< /Review>

I really don't like this dentist...They were rude and pulled out four of my teeth and acting like it doesn't hurt when in reality,it hurts badly when your teeth are pulled out with a needle.Then it gets worst.When you mistakely move or twitch,they stop moving then if you can't really stop,they get aggressive.Even my siblings had this problem with them being rude.Trust me.</text>

Amazing place and friendly service. Got a rootcanal here  Dr. Fayoumi took care of the prosedure and went well Angel assisted he was very friendly and took care of my measuremeants and made sure i didn't choke on my own saliva which i appreciate. The temp crown i have on right now lasted pretty well and wasnt bothersom was a perfect fit. I will follow up with the official crown aswell. Prices are fair and they also accept medical here for other needs for teeth. I also got my cavity filled here and great job done no pain. Receptions are best at reminding you and following up with your appt. Other than that best experience here . 😊</Text>

In door outdoor dining. Food was delish. Mains were 18oz ribeye, Mary's Bistro Chicken, Brisket Pappardelle in creamy sauce, Skirt Steak. Meats were cook to perfection and flavorful. Appetizers: Mushroom Bruschetta and Calamari were absolutely delish. Fried Brussel Sprouts was ok. Beet salad was also very good. Can't find much wrong with Saltyard, give it a try. Note: not a cheap lunch so bring money. My meal, including tip and tax, $75.00. It was worth it. All health protocols were followed.< /Review>

<Review>The kale salad was absolutely delicious. It was super fresh and very tasty. I would definitely come here again just for the salad. We also got the gnocchi appetizer which was not as good. And the sliders were also very good!

They set up a bunch of outdoor seating areas that were 6 feet apart, so while it wasn’t 100% safe, it was very nice to feel like we were somewhat back to normal.</Review>< Pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Name>Alex Chin< /Name><review>I went here on the anniversary of my deceased fiance's birthday. She died last year about 3 days before the date I went. I had a ceremonial meal between her and I and even ordered wine and food for her. Some of the other patrons looked at me funny but the restaurant was very good about it and provided me with excellent service. The waiter managed to get me a cheesecake with a candle for my beloved. I hope they threw away the fish that I ordered for her because it would be disrespectful if they ate it. When I first went there the waitress wanted to seat me next to the entryway where there was the most traffic in the restaurant and I didn't want to constantly be bumped by waiters and I wanted more privacy. I had to explain this to the Host, she was pretty stingy at first but after I told her I would have to bring my business elsewhere if she could not provide me with a table that she wasn't even using she finally gave me that table. I don't understand why I couldn't have used that table in the first place since it was not occupied and the reservation for that table was not for another 2 hours... She's the only reason why I gave it four stars otherwise they would get five. The waiters were very good and the chef's food was top notch. There is also outdoor dining available if you do not want to wait. The worst part of all about the seating is that I did make a reservation the host just did not want to honor it. I will have to re-examine this again next year on The anniversary.</review>< user_id>

We ordered in from India's Clay Pit tonight and had a decent enough experience. The delivery came early and the food was still hot. They did not give us any utensils, and only one sauce even though it was for two people. Also they don't include rice with the entrees, we only received one rice that we paid extra for.<//Review>

< review>
Really good food!! We shared the garlic appetizer followed by the beet salad. Both were high on our list of the best of their respective dishes we had ever had. We each got the Seabass for dinner and were a lil surprised when we were served the whole fish...head, tail, eyeballs and all. The flavor profile of the dish was outstanding, we just had to get past our surprise at presentation. All in all, this is a great restaurant foodwise. Cannot comment on the service because it was Valentines day weekend so not much interaction between us and waiter. But all the food came out on time, so, I give them 5stars<//review>

<Review>After successfully finding parking in chaotic downtown Burlingame, we arrived at Saltyard. No problem getting a table at 12:30 Saturday afternoon. Spacious dining area decorated with a lot of wine bottles! Full bar and outdoor seating as well.
Very courteous staff got us started with ice water, coffee and bread and butter. We ordered the Seafood Linguine and the Salmon and eggs lunch special. Both were incredible!
My check in with Yelp landed us a complimentary cheesecake which we substituted for the Tiramisu. The tasty dessert accompanied by one more cup of freshly brewed coffee was a perfect ending to a great lunch.

Intimate & Chic...love the wall to wall of different vintage of wine decor. Was absolutely impressed with our food and the service. Our Russian Server was charming and recommended dishes that we enjoyed. ESP loved the Chicken and the Seafood Pasta. Wines were also reasonably priced. Will return soon...</text>

< Review>
SO so so impressed by the food here!! My friend recommended it and I am so glad we got to try this place. Inside is definitely a more classy and modern feel. I came here around 7:30pm on a Tuesday and it was packed. A table left shortly after and we were seated immediately. We ordered the mixed greens salad and calamari first, and for entrees: filet mignon medallions, paella, and salmon.

The calamari and salad were great starters. They also give complimentary bread too. It did take a while for the entrees to come out, but we were enjoying eating and talking. When the food came out, it looked amazing. The salmon was well cooked and went well with the potatoes. The paella was super filling, but had such a great mix of seafood. The medallions was the best dish though; the filet mignon was SO tender. Each bite was amazing.

I would highly recommend this place. The food here is fresh and amazing. It would be a great place for a date with its modern and sleek decor. I would love to come here again soon.< /Review>

<Text>This is my second time here and I'm thrilled to say that I will be one of the regulars. This restaurant is just what Burlingame needed.

The decor, service, and food have all been top notch - I've had their salmon and duck pappardelli so far, and they have been cooked to perfection. I can't wait to try all of their dishes on the menu. Highly recommended!< /Text>< Pics>

At the moment  you step in this place  the stuff gives you a nice feeling. Very comfortable waiters, it is a lovely place to  pass time with friends and colleagues or with your date. Great  food, professional  chef, modest  price and nice  service. Warmly recommended.<//Text>

I'd been hearing about Saltyard for a couple months now, and finally decided to give it a try. Their wings, and sliders were both exceptional! Food and drinks came out in a timely manner. Our server knew exactly what he was doing. Very welcoming atmosphere. Great addition to Burlingame!< /Review>

Don't go to Saltyard unless  you plan to spend a few hours waiting for your meal.

Went at 12:30 on a Tuesday and it wasn't busy.  We ordered sparkling water, some appetizers, salad, and a couple of entrees and the entire experience was over 2 hours.

It took forever before we could even order our appetizers (they were delicious).

One of the steak entrees was very well done/overcooked,.

We had to ask for a napkin 3 times before it was delivered 20 minutes later.

It is unfortunate that the food was decent because I will not be returning because of the poor service.<//review>

<user_id>112088023390073041057<//user_id><text>Ordered this evening through Grubhub.  Moments later we were called by a very apologetic person on the other end.  They were out of one of the items we had ordered and wanted to make it right.  They suggested the kale salad and offered to add the prawns we had previously added to the salad they were out of.  DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!  The kale salad is amazing and the prawns were even better.  We will definitely order again.  They also put a sweet treat in our delivery - a slice of cheesecake and a kind apology.  Great recovery......and we really were not upset about the switch.🥰 Highly recommends the kale salad with prawns, the penne pasta, mashed potatoes and cheesecake.

<text>Fantastic experience tonight. We sat at the bar and the service and ambiance were spot on. The salmon main entree and the butter lettuce salad were beyond perfection. We ordered the crab cakes, and they were good but not wonderful. Despite this, we are still giving them five stars because overall it was an amazing dining experience and a really cute restaurant and lots of FUN!!! :-)</text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>This truly was a 5-star Thanksgiving experience, which was a surprise because we booked at the last minute. Such a pleasant surprise! Easy parking right out front, and, better yet, amazing service from drinks through dessert. Wonderful, craft cocktails got us started off right. We had calamari and Brussels sprouts for apps, followed by rave-worth clam chowder and delightful tomato and burrata salad. Two in our party had fall-off-the-bone short ribs, one a traditional turkey dinner that was reportedly moist and delicious, with just the right balance of herb seasoning. The chef transformed a meat-centered pappardelle into an amazing veggie dish for me (though more veggie options on the mains menu would be nice). All of this bounty would have made for a wonderful dinner on its own, but the superlative service--attentive, but never pushy--resulted in a relaxed, enjoyable Thanksgiving dinner. They even gave us a lovely piece of cheese cake to share! We'll certainly be back again!< /Review>< date>

<text>We came for dinner. The food was pretty tasty overall, but not amazing. For the price we would have expected better. The service was not good. We waited for a while after we sat down. Our drinks took a little while, and then we ordered appetizers. We tried to order entrees too, but the waiter asked if he could come back to take our entree order. That was a little weird, but ok.

We didn't see him for a long time after that. When we did see him, we had to grab his attention, and it was clear he had forgotten about us. After we finished our meals, it again took such a long time for someone to come by that we got up to ask for the check.

All in all we don't plan on coming back here.<//text>< pics>

Disappointing food, service was okay.
Went there for lunch and ordered the Calamari salad appetizer and a Prawns appetizer to share with my friend.

The food presentation was horrible and sloppy especially the Prawns appetizer. It did not look appealing and there was no flavor. For the price I paid for them I expected better quality food. Not worth it and will not go back.</Review>

<Review>Made reservations for 8pm, ended up waiting until 8:15 before we were seated. My husband ordered the chicken that was supposed to be “boneless”, but it was not. Food took over an hour to get to the table. Food was bad, service was slow and nonexistent. Definitely will not be returning.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Food was OK. What's disappointing is that the staff and cooks don't know the menu, or perhaps I was lied to, not sure... Ordered the Paella and was pretty sure the menu said it comes with lobster. I felt like I ordered it because I got excited about the lobster part of it but since I wasn't sure if I was remembering correctly, I asked the waiter. I was told me it in fact does not come with lobster. Fair enough, perhaps my mind was playing tricks on me.

On my way out I double checked the menu posted outside, indeed, it was supposed to include lobster.< /text></record>

First visit tonight, Sunday, uncrowded.
Very attractive interior.
Polite staff.
Just a few minor points:
Water glass had ice but no lemon; Refill had no ice.
Bread slices tasted like biscuit dough, and cold butter.
Calamari was ok; I would not have plated the darker brown many loose pieces of crust on the rectangular white plate.
The Hefe beer on tap was good; But no "happy hour 430-6p" early dinner discount from $7.
Recommended Short Ribs were just a bit salty.
Dessert menu was not presented; Walked myself from nice Hostess.
Gelato sounded good but I was full.
Bill for one,$49 and tipped $5.</review>

< Review>
We decided to try Saltyard as a family last night and were extremely disappointed in the service. We ordered our food at 7pm, a burger for our young children to share, a salad for myself and flank steak for my husband. It took them 30 minutes to bring my salad and a total of 40 minutes to bring my kids burger and husbands steak. And that was only after I complained about how long the meals were taking. They were not busy at all and the server we had was awful. Not one time did he check on us while we were waiting for our food nor did he check on us after we received our meals. We will not be going back— awful experience!</Review>

Disappointed for the price and lack of service. The food was just alright, bonus points for having gluten-free pasta though.

The food - We ordered calamari, salads to start. Our table of 8 got paperdalle, skirt steak, Short Rib, ciopionno, chicken penne. Paperdalle and short ribs were pretty good, tender meat and decent pasta, the pasta however wasn't that perfect aldente bite. The entrees also took almost an hour to make after we ordered, which to me is unacceptable.

The service - we had a table of 8, next to the entrance, first off each time the door opened the cold air and wind would hit us, super bad location for a table. The service was also non existant. We had to call for a waiter for everything, ordered appetizers, ordering entrees, asking for dessert menu, asking for fresh cracked pepper or parmesan. Not once did somebody ask / check on how things were.

At a more pricey place like this, I definitely expected more< /review>

Good food, so-so service. Seemed to have a language barrier with most of the staff. Limited beer selection, this is a wine bar kind of place.<//text>

<Review>I went for dinner this past Saturday and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant took over the space from Ecco and redid the layout. I don't really think much was carried over the previous place, but that's not uncommon.

I started with the prosciutto flatbread appetizer and it was the weakest link. It was a great combo of ingredients, but the crust was a bit underdone for my liking. As the saying goes, "your mileage may differ".

My entree was a duck confit pasta dish which was superb. It had the right balance for me. And the menu is surprisingly varied. They had everything from Niman Ranch cheeseburgers to risotto.

Another element I liked was the acoustics. There are a number of great restaurants in town, but have terrible acoustics.  That's not the case here as you can hear the folks in your dinner party.  For reference,  I was in the back corner table.

The staff was attentive and courteous. They were also apologetic too as I initially wanted the cheeseburger, but there was a grill problem. The better news is that duck pasta was far better than a cheeseburger.

Bottom line is I would definitely go back.<//Review>< rate>

Short story: skip it.

We came in for dinner but after sharing a small plate or two we decided it wasn't worth staying for dinner.

Crab tacos - tastewise these were ok. The crab tasted fresh and it wasn't overpowered by the other ingredients. For $18, though, these tacos needed double the amount of crab in them.

Charred broccoli and sunchoke - this should have been called arugula salad. It was a small pile of arugula with three florets of blanched, not charred, broccoli and two small sunchoke chunks. This salad was beyond disappointing.

My cocktail was overly sweet and tasted like there was no alcohol in it. My boyfriend ordered a Jameson and soda and got a Jack Daniels, then a Jameson and coke, before the drink was right.

Our bill came to $50 for a frustrating experience. Not sure if they're still working through opening kinks or what, but I don't plan to go back.<//Review>

The is a revised review of the one I previously gave

Ok.   I'm totally revising my review.   Background:  Came in with my SFO and friend for a dinner.  Food was very good but had about 7 glasses of wine spill on me.  Waiter was profusely apologetic but manager chose to ignore the situation. That really soured my experience and I wrote a 1 star review though would have loved to give less for the service.

Some months later, the Manager Baris contacted me and apologized.  To make matters right he invited me back with a complimentary bottle of wine.  We returned and invited our friend from last time and her SFO.  Baris ended up not only giving us some nice wine, but also some delicious appetizers and deserts.  Not only that, I come to find out that my friend had been back another time recently.  The waiter recognized her from the spill event and also gave her a glass of wine on the house.

So despite some stumbles at the beginning, Baris and his team more than made up for a catastrophic experience.  As before, the food here is quite delicious.  The short rib pappardelle really stood out...as did the cheesecake at the end.

Old Review:   I’d give em 4 stars for the food.   4 stars for service in general but 0 Star for the owner/manager willing to do what’s right.

Three of us had drinks and a meal here.  Ordered three flights of drinks so 9 glasses.  Waiter brought them over and managed to spill and break 7 of them as he served them.   There was broken glass everywhere and a bunch of wine spilled on my pants shirt and jacket.

Of course I did not have anything to change into but stayed for dinner despite me being soaked in wine.  You can probably see where this is going but before I get there, I want to be fair about the food.

We had several pasta dishes including a short rib and everything was quite good.  Also had a piece of cheesecake for desert which was not bad.

So we get the bill and I would have thought even a small discount would have been appropriate given the circumstance.  But there was nothing.  My partner went to talk to the host who claimed to be the owner and after some discussion he took off one piece cake for the incident.  Mind you I’m still soaked at this point.

In any case, the host never said anything To me and by not addressing the bill showed that he could not have cared less.  Bottom line for me is that based on the owners lack of concern to try to make the situation right, I won’t be back and don’t recommend it.   There are too many exceptional restaurants in the area to bother with this one.</review>

My family and I are always returning customers. We are always beyond satisfied. Andy and staff are very professional, honest, and friendly. Processing is always smooth and I am thankful for the cash/debit option for I don’t have any major credit cards at the moment. Car options are top notch and never have had any issues/complaints whatsoever. Andy strives for the best and it shows! So thank you Andy, for making car rentals as easy and smooth as possible!< /text>

Best in the business! Hassle-free, professional, and personable. Andy and his staff are very attentive and even helped me save HUNDREDS of dollars through their professional recommendations on insurance. I've rented in a professional capacity for years and knew exactly who to call when I needed a personal rental for a family vacation.</Text>

We are a new and local company and always thrive to do better. hope to see you soon for your next vacation car rental !!!!'}<//response><Text>I had a good smooth experience overall. Andy was upfront and honest about costs and the paperwork/walk through of the car was hassle free. The car I rented had some scuffs but otherwise reliable. They were also kind enough to drop me off at my home after completing my rental which was a big plus. Only complaint is that I was there at 8 am and no one was at the location until 8:40 am but that was minor compared to the excellent service.
Their prices are one of the best, if not the best, in town for car rentals. I advise calling ahead and making sure a car is available though since they are in high demand.<//Text></record>

Absolutely Excellent Service!! I highly recommend them, and will be using them again whenever I need a rental. They picked me up from work. No hassle for the rental, and when I returned the car, they even gave me a ride home to Tulare. Wonderful service and a real life-saver in an emergency! Thank you SO Much!!< /Text>

Great business great people good cars and had cars when the big name rental places were rented out. Was kind of weary of renting me a car due to my disability, but they trusted me therefore they've earned my business next time I need to rent a car. Even if I need to drive from fresno again.</text>

I called them up and informed them that I would be a few minutes late in dropping off the car rental coz I needed to fill it with gas. Isaiah waited and even gave me a ride to pick up my car from the auto repair shop.
Their car rental is clean, with pleasant smell and reasonable rental fee.
Thank you very much for your unparalleled phenomenal customer service.< /Review>< Time>

Best place in town to rent a car.  If you are looking to rent a car than make sure before you do you speak to Andy or one of his staff. They will beat the competitors price. Their selection of cars is nice. All low mileage new cars. I rented a car last week while I had some body work done on my truck. I wasn't sure how long I would need it but Andy made sure that I had that low price for however many days I needed it even if it was over the weekend. I dropped the car off on Saturday and the return process was just as fast and convenient as the rental. I left my garage door opener in the car and Andy made sure I knew and was able to swing by and pick it up days later.
Excellent experience renting a car from Express.</review>

<text>I highly recommend Express Car rental. Andy and Isaac were very helpful And accommodating. I told Andy if I can have One of my kids pick up the van since I was out of state and won’t make it on time to pick the rental van before their office closes. Andy made an arrangement and had His team Isaac met with my daughter to pick up the van. All the other rental places that I’ve called did not allow anyone else to pick up but  me. So I really do appreciate their business and kindness. When I returned the van, there was another guy who was talking to me, he sounded like one of the owners. He told me that since I was traveling far, he made sure that the van had new tires so we can be safe. Im sorry, I did not get his name but I appreciate his thoughtfulness too like Andy. And also, when my husband and I went to check out their 15 passenger van to make sure it’s big enough for my family, Andy asked for our IDs. When my husband
Handed his military ID, Andy told my husband that he was giving us extra discount for being in the military.  He already gave me a discount for being a first responder plus the military discount. I couldn’t ask for more. He was honest enough to offer us that extra discount. Again, thank you so much and I will recommend your business to my friends and families. Keep safe and I congratulate you for your honesty.  Caroline C.<//text>< Pictures>

The next time I need a rental I'll definitely come back to this place. 5 stars from me because these guys took care of me when the giants down the street failed me and sent me off without a car after having reservations. These guys price matched them and knocked off even more from the price. Thanks Express Car Rental!! My family trip probably would've been canceled if I had not found you on Google.</Review>

<text>By far the worst experience of my life. Very unprofessional and unclean. My mom called and reserved a car to take my grandfather to chemo in Stanford. We waited 3 hrs for the previous person to bring the car back, we then had to wait another 30 min so he could rent the lady another car. Andy did not clean the car before renting it to us he simply did a walk around the car and asked my mom to turn it on and give him the mileage. We ended up having to stay in Stanford some extra day's and informed them we had to do so. On 8/14/2020 they showed up to my moms house to pick up the car even after we told them we would be returning it that morning. We met them back at their office on Main where they refused to return my purse along with the rest of my belongings that was inside the car. They said we also owed them more money when we didn't. Giving we put a deposit down Andy because very aggressive with my mother and I, feeling uncomfortable I then called Visalia PD out to try and retrieve my belongings Andy still refused to hand them over. Even after the Visalia PD let them know that keeping my belongings is a Arrest-able offense.</text>< user_name>

<Response>{'time': 1599233366237, 'text': 'hi Samantha\nThank you very much for posting a review even though you should not because you are not the customer. any way let me give some facts for the all the viewers out there.\nYES , she have to wait for 2.5 hrs because we had NO cars and I went personally to another customers house to get the car for Samantha,s mom, and She conveniently forgot to mention that out of those 2.5 hours 2 hours were past by our close time. SO yes i did made a mistake by helping a customer by staying 2 hours past by our closing time. next time i should not do that.\nsecondly , on the day of return I called them and she ( mom) told me that they are running late and will come in the morning, I said ok.\nbut they never came for next three days and after calling many times without any answer,  we decided to go to their place and take our car back. in the car there were drug needles, small buds and car was filthy dirty, Which Samantha denies of knowing that those were hers or her moms.  ( photos can be provided upon request). at that time MOM owed us 400 dollars.\nSamantha called Visalia PD to recover her stuff. but we refused and PD agreed to that ,PD also said that they cant proved that those drug needles or buds were hers or moms, and asked us to dispose them, which we did. We even try to give her break and asked her to bring 150 and take her stuff back but she bought the PD instead.\nAnyway she bought PD again and after a lot of drama we choose to give her her IDs / CARDS and her boyfriends IDs and Cards\n\nin the conclusion , I waited for them after my work hours and helped them above and beyond so Samantha can go to Stanford ? what she and her mom did is take the car for FREE ride, thinking we cant do anything,\nWe are a small business and strive to help our customers so they can be in a brand new car. We make sure that every customer is taken care of and when we get customers like Samantha or her Mother taking our car for Free ride and not paying what is Due , it is harder for us to help others just like her in the hour of need with cash or debit card.'}</Response><GmapID>0x80952ff5c94f5d7f:0x918aa41b325daa52</GmapID>< user>

Andy & Isaiah were extremely helpful when I needed to rent a car last minute. They are also the only rental car location in Visalia that is open on a Sunday and I really appreciate that they were open. They went out of their way to accommodate us and were so kind and pleasant to work with. I would definitely recommend renting with them.</Text>

NeverPay Cash!  I was recommended to seek insurance from Express Car Rentals. He recommended Dairy Auto Land, and Freeway brokerage accomodatted. I purchashed what I was told I needed, "a non-owners policy".  When I rented a vehicle from Andy he called and verified I had full coverage. This Insurance's affiliates validated vocally, on speaker,  that I had full coverage to rent from Express Rentals Visalia- Andy truly verified this, as I gave the insurance company permissio into speak with him. I was scammed into purchasing this insurance. Luckily, I only had a blow out. South of Bardsley I rode out the car until it stopped (see pic). I was waiting on the 99 Highway after calling Tow One, who began to remove tire but when payment was questioned.
He unjacked (lowered) the vehicle a safety wasnt on his mind, he didn't want to get in trouble from his "boss"! He called and negotiated a price with Andy (Express Rental Agent), without my knowledge. Eventually45 minutes later, as payment was more important than safety a decision was made. Not my decision, the payment decision.
For a full hour I was terrified as diesels and cars zipped by at fast speeds. Then the man, from Tow One, in a solar tint pickup; asked me to help him, and I did. Even with a broken sandle on my left foot.  Freeway told me I didn't have full coverage or road side assistance. I was dumbfounded as I followed protocol any other insurance company would want.  Well after the spare was on, I realized it looked awfully low. Tow one solar truck zipped off! I noticed the spare was little, but looked like it needed air badly. Thankfully the next ramp I pulled up to, had an adjacent  gas station.  I added 40 PSI to make it 60 PS (spare tire stated, needed PSI.
After all this no one called to see if the car or me were ok. I went to return the vehicle that night,  Andy was locked and closed. Summary:  Freeway Insurance lied to Express Rentals- Yet juxtaposed they both lied too me. I returned the vehicle two days early. Lost full deposit, and only reason they both win is because I was low on funds and had no protection of a bank. Everything was in cash. Thank Jesus I handled the blowout the way I have read in the past and no one other than me were hurt or highly inconvenienced.
LEARNED: So, Freeway Insurance (Broker for Dairy Autoland) lied to Express Rentals-who would, "never rent out a vehicle without verifying full coverage"!  Andy didnt - it was vocalized on speaker it fast covered to drive. I was scammed for cash and guess how much it cost to have a man put on a spare, with assistance? 300.00 Dollars. OH-HE gave a 50.00 dollar discount (see added pic). I love how  Freeway Insurance states to me it was Express Auto Rentals lie, he  then blames the Auto One Tow man in the solar tint truck to save me off a busy highway. At the end when I open the glovebox I find an interesting bumper sticker (see pic). Oh, I was also told I should of called Andy the "employee" to use his AAA.  Before renting he stated the tire sensor light was on but everything was ok and had been checked out. Also, I was never told to call him in case of a blowout (isn't this why we want insurance)!
For five days I paid 591.00 to be scammed. When I learned there was no full coverage by the man who verified it with Freeway (Dairy Autoland); Who would want that liability? Looks like this Freeway Insurance has bad rap. I should of never gave cash to an agent, when another customer is yelling they cancelled his policy after paying while I was in the office. Yes these are unprecedented times. How much more can a business take from ya? How many more profited off a lie Freeway Sold? Oh Tow One took 50 bucks off (see pic).He truly was going to leave me there. This was highly dangerous, and I believe anytime  during rush hour; a vehicle and driver should be towed. Not put to work, and jacked up in such conditions. Nice guys finish last, and although I would not say Andy is rude.You just don't put people in bad cars! Andy, has some accountability here, tire sensor light.-Dairy is investigating.< /Text>

We do this with all customers CASH or CREDIT,we verify their insurance .\nSecondly tyre blowout is a Roadside assistance issue and that is between you and your insurance company. I did not lied to you as you said yourself that they said its full coverage so we have to take their word for it,  if  they don't abide by their word then you should take ISSUE to them not with Express car rental.\n\nYou are the one who called the insurance company and tow truck for help. They did not helped you instead I helped you by paying the tow company 250 dollars thru our company card  ( which was deducted from your rental) . Please understand this,  that roadside assistance like blow out , lockout, out of gas is a Renters responsibility and not ours unless you buy Roadside assistance from us directly.\n\nFinally you are complaining about  the money you paid because 250 dollars for towing was included in that money. and that is your responsibility. because of this blowout Express car rental is out for the new tyre and installation and the discount given to you.\nI will really appreciate if you could take this issue with insurance company just the way you posted here.\n\nI also have nothing against you, and welcome you to come and talk to me anytime so that i can explain how these things works.\nbest of luck to you for future."}< /Response><Rating>1<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My truck was in the shop and every other rental service was unable to help me due to me being from out of state. Express rentals was amazing and didn't hesitate to work with me and get me a rental to get to work. Their cars were clean, had no problems, and their customer service was great. I recommend them and will use them in the future.< /Review><Date>1594070838954< /Date></record>

Great experience with staff as well as the Van we rented this weekend . We drove to South of Lake Tahoe and back to Porterville,CA. It was a 6 hour drive  a total of about 12 hours . The Van was clean and in great conditions. It was also very comfortable for 15 passengers! Gas mileage was also great !<//Review>

Andy was very nice and so was his assistant. The overall experience was fast and easy. I give a four star rating because I hoped they would have told me before I rented the vehicle that it smelled like cigarette smoke it’s not his fault that consumer smoked but I should have been aware so that I may have chose another vehicle. I live 40 min away and didn’t want to turn around because we were leaving on a family trip. Cigarette smoke is awful.<//review>

<review>I strongly recommend renting from here you won't be dissatisfied Andy is very easy to work with and accommodating, the rates are very fair cars are always clean customer service is 5 star. It's a lot better and easier then renting from a corporate company. Thank you Andy and express for your help it made these past couple months easy and affordable for me to get to and from work.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Hands down best experience I’ve ever had. Andy was extremely courteous and accommodating. They offered an amazing group/company rate on a vehicle that I needed for the next day and I came in right before closing time. The vehicle was nice and clean and exactly what I needed. I will definitely be recommending this company to others coaches.

This was the first time I've ever rented a car and it was a quick and simple process. I got the 2020 Hyundai Elantra which was a great car. It was clean. The owner even offered to give me a ride home after dropping off my rental at the office. I would definitely rent from Express Car Rental again.<//review>

Express Car rental is quite a helpful service in Visalia. We rented a Toyota Camry for a family trip. The car was in excellent condition, it was like new only. They also gave us a baby seat and took all the care we need while carrying a baby in car. I loved the service they gave us for a very affordable cost.< /Text>

I rented a Kia Optima for my sister's wedding day from Express Car Rental. The car looked amazing when they sent it to us. The manager himself sent it with the greetings and all the maintenance was already done so that my sister's wedding ride goes well. I really like how personalized services they have offered to us.< /text>

My car had to go into the shop for repairs after being in a collision... my insurance initially set me up with a rental through enterprise but they refused to assist me bcuz ii didnt possess a Bank issued debit card🙄....so after callin around a few places Hertz recommended me to call Andy at Express Car Rental and within a couple min of doin so ii had my reservation all set up....Service was fast, friendly and convenient for my situation.... Did ii mention they also work with you for cash rentals & no card required?? 👌Definitely worth the price for the rental of a 2020 Honda Civic && look forward to business in the near future!! Thanks Andy once again appreciate the helpful business 😁💯< /Review>

Had a great experience when I went to rent a car. They had new car for me, and gave me 25 % off of my quote from other company. We will definitely recommend them to our family and friends.

< Review>
the cars are brand new. prices are second to none. the management are extremely courteous and helpful. i cant say enough good about this new company. ive rented from budget and enterprise before and i have never gotten the standard of service, quality of vehicle and outstanding price from any other company. i live in tulare and chose to go to them in visalia because they were nicer and worked with me. i will use them from now on. they even went as far as offering a ride home after i returned the vehicle. amazing.< /Review>

As a woman, I always stress that I will be taken advantage of at auto shops, but this shop is now my go-to and #1 recommendation! The team were respectful, quick, and definitely did not overcharge me. Plus, masks worn 100% of the time even when customers weren’t present which is great.<//review>

PLEASE REMEMBER TO CONFIRM/QUOTE THE PRICE OF THEIR SERVICE BEFOREHAND. That was my mistake and now I'm kicking myself for it. I bought bare rims and a set of tires and brought them in for installation and tire balance. I cleaned the rims and took the time to clean and peel off the weights that were stuck inside the wheel wells (not easy to do) to make installation easier on his employees. I even carried the rims and tires into his shop and carried them out on my own. They didn't have to take the wheels off or install them on my car nor did they have any used tires to dispose of. IMO, $200 is too expensive and I got ripped off.</Text>

Took my car to Paul’s today for a wheel alignment as my car was pulling pretty hard to the left. The guy in the office (didn’t get his name) was very nice and professional. The alignment was completed (took somewhere around 1-1:30 hr) and I paid $102 for it.

When I drove away I noticed that the car was still pulling to the left so I turned around and came back to the shop. Multiple workers all stopped what they were doing and immediately started looking at all the tires and after talking a bit they figured out the problem. Then they rotated all the tires for free, test drove it, and when they confirmed it was all good, handed it off to me.

Even though it took an extra 20-30 minutes, just wanted to call out how everyone in the shop went the extra mile to make it right when the alignment wasn’t the only thing my car needed.

I also liked how they didn’t try to push new tires on me but when I asked they said I could probably replace two of them but it’s not needed immediately.

Will definitely be back for anything related to tires. Thanks again!!</text>

I called Paul’s to see if they could help with a low tire. They got me right in and patched the tire. I was in and out in 45 minutes. The price was very reasonable. My experience matched that of other reviewers - quick service at a reasonable price. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Text>Only shop in San Francisco that would service an RV due to the bad name drug addicts give RV owners. But when I called Paul's they treated me like a person and ordered the Tire we needed and had it the next day and only took 15 mins to replace it. Thank you Paul's for being decent people  whom don't judge orders. WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!!!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

These guys were incredibly thorough and professional. I cannot recommend them enough.

A few weeks ago, I came in with a completely vague tire issue. Though I suspect a leak, I couldn't say for sure because my dealership swore that tires were fine. But it was clear that something was off, because the pressure was always lower than it should have been!

Within the hour, they had determined that the nozzle on the tire was loose, which my dealership hadn't noticed the last two times I went to talk to them! And because the fix was so small — it just needed tightening — they fixed it for free.

I was very impressed with their service and their integrity. For tires, I definitely recommend Paul's.</Text>

<Review>I have been going here so long I can't imagine gong anywhere else.  Paul's was the original "if it gets a flat, we fix it free" guys.  They have always gone out of their way to accomodate me, even in emergencies (Flat tire, middle of the night, had to go out of town, yadayada).  They have helped my fam and erstwhile friends, too.  (and don't hold it against me).  They will work with you to get the best tire for the best price and the service is top notch.  I would give them more stars if I could.</Review>< pictures>

<text>I bought 4 tires some years ago.  They offer free inspections and rotations every 6 months or 5000 miles.  I found them to be very friendly and useful.  I had a tire alert light on for a long time and couldn't figure out why.  They discovered that the spare tire needed air to get the light turned off.< /text>< pics>

Had an engine light on my car due to loose fuel cap. I don't know why I stopped by his place but I will regret it forever. The guy checked the error code and cleared it. Took less than 10 minutes for the whole thing and when I asked him, is he going to charge me? He said yes $50 !!! No honest car repair shop in whole of USA, charges you for reading the code and clearing it. When I said "Really, that's a rip off man". He said "If you can't afford $50 then you shouldn't be driving this car". I said - "Well take my money. Do you want me to tip you as well? This is the last time you will ever see me". Avoid this shop if you can !!! Very rude customer service.<//Review>

This is the second time I am using this shop but I am happy to see their consistency. They have various tires even though mine was a little bit difficult to find; they ordered it and in two days I was on my way with my new tires. The cost was not so different but the quality of the job makes it worth it.< /Text>

<Text>I seldom if EVER write reviews online. Paul and his son have taken care of my tire and alignment needs for several years now and I always come back and trust them entirely with my tire needs.

On numerous occasions when I suspect tire issues, I've had them evaluate the tire and he's never charged me a single dime. There have been times I've visited his shop and I remember I had tires and wheels that suffered damage that needed replacement-- instead of having me car-less for a period of time pending repairs and ordering of new tires/wheels, he lent me his own wheels and tires that fit for temporary use without charging me *anything* extra. You will NOT find another family owned tire repair provider that will treat you with such kindness and generosity like your own family. I couldn't possibly recommend Paul's Tires more.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x8085873dfc3e818d:0xe9ad21b51a1431fc</gmap_id></record>

I've been going to Paul's Battery & Tire Service for years, as well as many of my friends and family.  Some of these reviews are vicious, and I am here to say they do an excellent job mechanically and I can always take my truck in and they check and rotate my tires for free.  They are trustworthy, fast and honest.  Plus they have been there forever....a native San Franciscan.  whoop whoop< /Review>

<text>While I can assume the actual service of my car was done well, the customer service was not. I was quoted three times at one price over the phone. Twice prior to the appointment, and once the day of. I had someone else bring my car in, which is why I confirmed DAY OF what the price would be. They charged me more than the verbal quote for no apparent reason. I came to you for your price and you played me. Worse, you lied to me and gave your business a bad name. I'd rather go somewhere full of honesty and integrity. Such a bummer.</text>< username>

I got a flat tire and wanted to see if it could be patched up. I drove over to Paul's on my spare and was told it would be about 30 minutes. It's easy to spot where a tire is leaking air if you submerse a pressurized wheel into water, bubbles will quickly tell where the leak is. My wheel and tire had no bubbles, so they put the wheel back on the car for me. All of this, for no charge. If they had found a hole that could've been patched, they would have done that.

I appreciate honesty and these guys were.< /Review>

Do not take your car here.  They stole mine, or they allowed someone else to steal it.  They do not park the cars in the garage, or on the street in front of the shop where it is under street lights and there are a lot of people, or even locked up.  They drive the cars 4+ blocks away and park them on dark residential streets.  I took my car in on a Monday and said it would be several days to get tires for my HONDA CIVIC.  I thought that was weird, but I told them to just let me know when everything was ready for me to pick up.  They called me on Thursday and said my car was ready for me, I was at work so I said that I would come in on Friday when they opened, and they said this was fine.  I showed up at the shop, paid for my tires and was waiting for my car by 7:55am on Friday.  At 8:10, I went inside to ask the manager where my car was.  He called one of the mechanics, and ran out of his office without saying anything to me.  He finally came back to the shop at 8:20 and told me he could not find my car.  I cannot believe they stole my car.  I filed a police report and the manager said to the officer that  my car had been parked there since TUESDAY.  They did not call me until Thursday.  Do not take your car to Pauls Tire, they are irresponsible and will not take care of your property.<//text>

<text>Despite the appointment at 1:00 PM Sep 24,2015, they hadn't repaired my car for more than 2 hours (fixing a leaking tire=20-30 min at most) but, with hindsight, most of the time, let it stand on the street near Paul's.  The job was finished by paying and receiving receipt (3:45:01 PM  sep 24, 2015).   A parking ticket was issued to my car but Paul's removed it to hide it from me (hindsight). And naturally I had not known the fact until I got a second notice

I called the number at the notice to confirm the date and time and found that the time of parking violation was the one when my car was at Paul's hand !!!!!

<review>Great service and the Teas are amazing. I've been having a hard time finding quality drinks since moving to the valley from the bay area. But this place definitely delivers. The ambience is friendly and the staff are helpful with suggestions and samples. I hate going to a place that has mediocre drinks, has bad K-Pop playing in the background and the staff know you have no other choice so they don't care what you want or ask or need. These guys are different and are obviously happy to make what you want.< /review>< Resp>

All the employees are extremely friendly, welcoming, polite, and have always made delicious drinks! The owner is a very nice man as well and the employees seem happy to be at work. I always get the mango green tea which is a probiotic with either mango stars or strawberry hearts ❤ definitely worth stopping by!!< /Review>< pics>

Really good drinks my personal favorite is kiwi green tea with kiwi popping bobas but they have gotten my drink wrong a few times. Check that it's what you want before you leave and make sure you tell them how much ice and sugar you want because they sometimes forget to ask.</Text>

I've frequented many tea places in Stanislaus county and this place is by far the best. The quality of the tea is far above anything else available around here. They have a great variety so any time you want something different there is always something new and delicious to try. On top of that the atmosphere is chill with good music and the owner/staff are always incredibly friendly and helpful. Probably the only place in the immediate area for real quality oolong.< /review>

<review>I love my milk teas blended and this place is the best one I've had in modesto. The ice doesnt dilute the taste at all. But, the original boba pearls are rather unusual in the way that instead of a gummy bear chew, you get a very melt in your mouth pearls. It was a shock and unexpected. Pretty gross at first because I have never had such texture before. The taste is all there though and I wouldn't mind going back, but I'd rather stay with the coconut jelly 🤗</review>< Resp>

Hands down, best boba shop in Modesto! We love coming in for the jasmine milk tea; it's the REAL thing, which is hard to find around here. Everyone is always super nice and helpful, and whenever I want something different, they always have a great recommendation for me.</Text>

Very happy to see One Tea is opening a location in Modesto. One Tea is not Vietnamese tea, yet it has that too. One Tea is more of a ‘What can we do different we green tea’ type of tea house.  I hope everyone else likes them too.
Uploaded more pictures of their tea. YUM< /Text>

Just stopped in to check this place out and was very impressed! The workers are young, but so friendly and helpful. I asked for drinks they would recommend and the worker helping me walked me through the menu and made it really easy for me to understand my options and to make a decision. Excellent customer service! Also, they serve boba, tea, and coffee here, so there're options for everyone. I tried the passion fruit juice w/ agar jelly and aloe vera, which is awesome if you like passion fruit (I would start out at 30% sugar though, just to be on the safe side. You can always add more sugar later!) I also got a cafe Americano, hot and black, since I was in need of some energy, and it was so yummy! The place itself is so clean and the style is very modern, yet warm and colorful. They have a lot of tables where people can come in and stay and chill for awhile, just like any other tea or coffee shop. They even have games set up for people to play. What a cool little boba/tea/coffee shop! I'm so glad such a chill place with yummy drinks has opened up in Modesto! (And they're open til 10 pm, which is hard to find for a shop like this locally. Yay!)< /review>

Great experiences with these guys! I’ve brought my boat into their shop multiple times and have nothing but positive things to say. I had an ongoing issue that another shop took 6+ months to try to diagnose. After I had to continuously pressure them for updates they finally decided I needed an entire new motor. Oscar and his team at Elsinore Marine were able to determine it was simply a loose part that did not even need to be replaced. They literally saved me thousands of dollars. After they earned my trust by fixing my motor issue, I had them upgrade my entire sound system. I took the boat out this weekend and it ran good as new and the system sounded amazing!

I highly recommend!<//Text>

<Text>I'm a new boat owner and spun a prop. I had no idea how to fix it. He took the time and helped me replace the hub in the parking lot, explaining how to do it myself in the future. Real nice guy. I've found my go-to boat guy and you should come here also.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1620241524604</Time><Resp>None</Resp><text>We took our boat here in late February. We took it in for an ignition, an outdrive service and an oil change on a MerCruiser inboard/outboard motor. They performed all work except the oil change .  It took them about 6 weeks to perform the outdrive service and the ignition replacement. So we go to pick it up and notice the oil change hasn't been done. So we leave and are told it will be done by the following tuesday. 3 weeks later, we still don't have a call that our boat is done, so my husband stops by to check on progress and we are told that there is water in the oil. So diagnose it and then we can talk about fixing it if it fits within our budget, we say. 3 more weeks go by and still no phone call, so we just pick up our boat. Mind you, we didn't have water in the oil when we dropped it off all those months ago. This place is unprofessional and they wrecked our boat and wasted our time. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that won't waste your time or wreck your boat's motor!!!< /text><user_name>Emily Arnold</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>If I could give no stars I would. This business is a complete joke. Dropped my boat off after waiting 3 weeks for my appointment date. Bring my boat to the shop(which he had no idea on the date he gave me) Oscar said he would be looking at it within the next day or so. A week goes by..... no phone call no communication.... So I decide to drive there to check in on it and find out they had not even looked at it! 🤯Trying to call this shop to at least see when your job will be done or if it even has been started or looked at is absolutely impossible. They don’t ever answer the phone, and the voicemail box is full!
This is a warning to stand clear from this shop! They lack professionalism and work ethic. You can tell upfront that Oscar(the owner) does not value your business. Reading these other reviews from people that have used this shop should have warned me enough.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dc9a67597c1b4d:0x94aa974aa17ead1a<//gmap_id>< userid>

I don't have a boat, but I do ride by this place on my bike. It looks clean and seems like a good place to get a boat repaired. When I see a place that looks clean, I would be more likely to do business there. I always think it is a good idea to do business locally if it is possible. If you have a boat, maybe you should check it out!!!< /Text>

We have went in a few times now and she was the whole package. She's beautiful and funny ...  But mostly knowledgeable. Knows her stuff for sure.  We already feel like we are a part of the water family. Thank you for being so welcoming and helping us get on the water to make many many memories!!</review>

<text>Friends boat stayed at this shop for almost 3 weeks . Charged over $200 and initial issue wasn’t even fixed because they lacked the skill to get the job done . Ridiculous to charge and didn’t even notify , had to follow up ourself. Bad business in my opinion and have lived here in elsinore 20 years.<//text>< username>

I have been having my boat and pwc serviced here for the past 5 years and have nothing but great things to say about Lake Elsinore Marine.  They have always gone the extra mile to make sure our boat was in great shape for the summer.  There is definitely a reason why they are so busy- because they honest, knowledgeable and friendly.  They offer a great selection of parts and accessories, their store has saved our weekend a few times.  All of the mechanics are very knowledgeable and the girls in the office are a blast and know their boats.  Last summer they replaced the engine in our Larson, their price was unbeatable and the quality of work was unmatched.  The final bill was less than the estimate I was given and the work was done in a very timely manner.  We could not have been more pleased.  They are normally booked about 10-14 days out so you will have to wait for your boat to be worked on but it is well worth your wait.  Like I said prior- there is a reason why they are so busy- its because they are very good at what they do.< /review>

Since Mark took back an active role in the business the customer service has improved dramatically and our boat has never run better. They take a lot of pride ensuring we are up and running as much as possible and if you run into trouble on the lake they will come and get you even when they are closed.  We've been using Lake Elsinore Marine for about 4 years and the last 2 years have been very happy with the results and highly recommend them.</review>

Do no take your Boat Here!!!!! They told us in two weeks the job will be done. I was going to  be called by the first week, here we are in week three after I was told that it was already in the shop 3 days ago not counting Monday and Tuesday (closed), she had the nerve to be rude when I asked so how many days will it be in the shop  before you can tell me what is wrong? she then said I do not know!!!! rudely, how can you not know that answer...its been 3 days to inspect a Boat.... NOP never again...Please take into consideration this Reviews they are the TRUTH unless you want your boat within a YEAR .....</review>

< Review>
I had a intermittent  problem with my boat .  it would just die when you were going.  I took it to two other shops and they weren't able to fix it.  Finally I took it to lake elsinore marine They ran the boat around on the lake until they found the problem and fixed it.  I'm very pleased with the service there.  The crew is friendly and knowledgeable.  I will be using them to service my boat from now on<//Review>

<Text>If I could give less than one star I would! You need to leave your boat there to get in line. No appointments are taken.
It took 1 week before they looked at it. Once they figured out the problem it took another 4 days to get a part. Why can I get almost anything from Amazon in 2 days?
When we got the boat home we noticed horrible stains on the upholstery. After taking the seat cushions back in, them trying to remove the stains but couldn't, they said the stains were not caused by them.
So two weeks later our boat is fixed but has stains seats and the whole experience left us looking elsewhere to take out boat.
Since they basically said they can't do anything to help then I can say we can take out boat elsewhere!
Very poor business attitude towards a local!!!!
Do not take your boat here!!!!  Go anywhere else!!!!!!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<date>1379544852113</date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I have been a customer of this fantastic company since 2008.  In fact, I purchased my fist sea worthy boat here from Lindsy and Gwen.   They were very helpful and taught me the ins and outs of boating and going to sea.  Apparently, the fact that I was a noob was very obvious as Gwen told me that I would surly die if I go to sea with out taking a proper coast guard class.    They truly looked out for my family's safety and the class that they offered saved our lives in a storm on Lake Mead.

They also serviced my other boat (30' Bayliner)  My time on the water absolutely started with this local business.  Their prices are not as cheap as Buba working in a garage, but the work is done right 100% of the time and I can go to sea with the knowledge that I, my family and vessel are safe.   I would 100% recommend!!

Side Note:  The counter girl (Katie) is good eye candy so its a win win.< /Text>< Pictures>

RUN don't walk away!!!!!! At first this seems like a nice place to bring your boat but its not. My problem started last year around august of 2012. I took my 89 bayliner capri with a l-drive to the shop to have my carbs synchronize after I cleaned them and my timing checked. I spoke with the owner and explained that this engine is not for the novice they are very picky he told my he would have his best mechanic Linsy on it so I was satisfied. Then after a week of no calls I decided to check in. I was then told a kid named Oscar was working on the boat :(. So I talked to him and he said great news the boat was running.(IT ALREADY RAN) I explained to him that it didn't have a problem running. He then said the stator was on to tight and he had to take off the fly wheel to fix it so I ok the repair. #weeks go by before I call back. He says he is having trouble getting it to time and asked if it ran fine before :(  which it did. He then said Linsy  was going to have to work on it :(. I finally get a call Dec 2,2012 Linsy said he doesn't know why it wont time but he was going to do a few more things to it. Finally I call April of 2013 and Linsy has given up told me to pick up my boat. No prob I said. When I went to pick up my boat it was covered :) but it had been sitting with all the spark plugs removed :(.... They had lost my transom saver which irreplaceable since they do not make them for my boat any more but I was told if I and I repeat I was to find one they would pay me back for it GRRRRRR. So when I got home to do the job my self Oscar had put the trigger back on backwards , Cracked my timing adjuster and lost the jam nut that hold the adjuster in place. AAAWWWWW  Which I was able to see in 5 minutes of inspection. So one day later and the cost of a timing gun I had my boat running and timed. Did I mention this is my first boat EVER. So I did the job of a boat repair tech with 37 years of experience in one day which he failed at doing with almost 9 months of trying.  Sorry for the long review but like I said Run away from this store since their appears to be no actual boat tech working there.</review>

Today was my first visit and I was very impressed! The staff were so kind and helpful. Jessi explained how it works and all the info on the store! I was also helped by another sweet gal (long pony tail) and she helped me to my car and loaded everything up! I will definitely be returning 😊</Text>

<review>Not happy at all my milk always goes bad 😒 since the first time I came here Ive had most my milk go bad. They give you milk that has a few days to expire. I asked for the longest date but they always say thats all they have. Ive had 2 cheese given to me molded 😠 Its really annoying honestly I go here because I dont want to hasstle at grocery stores but I guess Im going to have to do that. Im not gonna be coming back with my bad items all the time for exchange. Im not sure how often this place gets audited or checked by health department.</review>< resp>

Maria (Manager), you totally suck. Do yourself a favor and don't work the front. You have no people skills, half the time you spoke to me i didn't realize you were speaking to me cause you made no eye contact nor did you direct your voice towards me. You out of ALL people should have known to hand me a card showing me the products but no, you mouthed them off quickly. You didn't even ask if I knew how it worked cause I'm still getting use to it. The couple of times Ive been here everyone has been helpful, courteous and asked questions. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT train your employees to be like you and do NOT work the front. Stay in the back and process paperwork cause you super suck with people. I've been a retail manager for 15 years and you are the type of person I would never hire.</text>

I absolutely love this place!!! Not only is it clean, but the employees are super nice and greet you right away and if they are busy with another customer or what not they will let you know they'll be with you in a moment not like other places where they leave you standing there and not acknowledge you even being there... I am on my third visit here and it has been awesome since day one when i switched from Mommy's nutritional center in Azusa.

I had called ahead of time to ensure that they had the formula i was looking for, not only did they have it but when i walked in the person i spoke with recognized my voice and took her time to walk over and speak to me and say thank you for taking the time to check them out and all. And since I was a first timer there they took time to explain to me the process that they have : if your getting fruits and veggies you take a number and a basket and get your coupons worth amd then they'll call you up, if not you go straight to the person so they can get you your milk, cereal, formula, etc. It's a great place they have a good variety of fruits and vegetables they also have eggs, chorizo, guava, water and different types of drinks and snacks that i definitely did not see at Mommy's nutritional center at all. Not only were their attitudes positive they were just nice all around where as in the other place they look like they dont even want to be there at all lol. They also help you carry everything out to your car in a little shopping cart. They're also bilingual they speak English and Spanish. And are open early by 7:30 am which is also a nice thing unless your not a morning person.</review>

(Translated by Google) A bad experience I always go there .. But yesterday I was treated by very despotic and rude people
. It seems that one comes to ask for a gift

Dixon will always have a special spot in my heart! Thank you for the enthusiasm and humanity, especially during such crazy times. Folks, be patient and groove out to some tunes while you order, it’s well worth the wait.

This place is the bomb diggety BEST!! My cousin pulls up (were from Illinois so a little showing off ;-)   ) and they call her by name and have her drink ready pronto! This is hometown service and I'm from a midwest hometown! I love that they cared enough to make her feel special and in turn we felt special because of her.< /Review>

My mom and I bought a few gifts cards in December with $30 on each gift card from this location. Turns out they were never loaded with money on them; they were just empty gift cards. I was given a number to call to get the issue resolved. We played phone tag for a week, but other than that they loaded the gift cards with the money on it with no issue. I know mistakes happen and I’m thankful they were able to fix everything for me.<//review>

After years of going to Dutch I've decided to no longer go. After the last manager left for a week straight my drink was made wrong, the kicker is I always order the same drink day after day after day. The Dutch company has lost touch in training the staff to make quality drinks. If you order a drink it should be the same everytime. I guess more then anythong its disappointing. (BTW I love and miss all the staff) Dutch Corporate get back into quality not quantity!< /Text>

This place is a million times better than Starbucks! You can actually taste their coffee which isn't masked by a ton of sugars and syrups. The Iced Caramelizer and Blended Peach Soda are my favorites. This particular location is wonderful! My husband visits regularly and a few of the employees recognize him and know his order by heart. The last time we visited, he politely informed the employee that when he'd came the day prior that they might have given him the wrong drink. With no hesitation, they comped this most recent order and as an added bonus gave me a free drink that another customer refused and would have otherwise been tossed. No matter how long the line is, they're on top of their game and pump out orders quickly. We can always rely on the super friendly and personable employees here for amazing customer service!<//review>

Never again!! To get up to the window takes forever and once your in line you can’t get out. We are usually on our way to work at night. The wait at this  location takes to long! Might have something to do with them not coming out to take orders til we are one car away from window. When I inquired why and why the other side wasn’t open, she was rude and said I don’t know and walked away. My advice is to stop in Davis or Vacaville. Staff are friendly and service is quick.</Text>

Dutch Bros is my preferred coffee place and this one looks really sleek and nice. The only big issue I have is the drive through, which means longer lines than the other one in town. Still, its a good place location wise so major boon.<//text>

<Text>The drive-thru is convenient. When it is busy there are additional employees who help take orders and payment while you are in the drive-thru to help move everyone along. The few times I've parked and ordered as a walk-up customer, I've been acknowledged quickly and helped as quickly as they could. This spot can get very busy at different times. However, I believe their Americano is better than Starbucks.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This is the newest Dutch Bros that opened in Dixon. It was kinda like a maze getting here, but it wasn’t difficult. Unlike the other Dutch Bros that I have been through, this one has a parking lot, in addition to their drive thru. They also had 3 tables so that you can sit after you’ve ordered and I’ve heard that they will be adding more seating. Oddly enough, I think this place has the potential of becoming a hang out spot. The staff here is really nice! I’m always so lost whenever I come to Dutch Bros, but the girl who took my order walked me through it and helped me customize my drink. I drove out of my way here just for the novelty, but I would recommend coming here if you’re in the area!< /review>

<review>Today I went in and Danny and Genenis provided amazing customer service. There was a small little incident with my order and Danny stepped in and fixed it fast like nothing. He was very nice and polite and Genesis was very helpful. Highly recommend this places and if you run into this workers you will have a great experience!< /review><Name>Sandee D</Name><time>1613961279081<//time>< pics>

Horrible! I ordered the number 9 with no pickles or onion and i seen they placed it on the screen and receipt that i said no onions or pickles and still they out onions and pickles on my order and that order was for someone that cant eat pickle or onions is bad for them! Lucky we saw tht it had rhose things bc if they would have taken a bite of it we would have had to go to the emergency i would never come back especially seeing that it has a 3.9 rating shows how lack of customer service or customer satisfaction  this McDonald’s has thank you anyways next time be careful how u do orders u never know whats the reason someone is saying to not put those things on it someone can be allergic to it</text>

Manager Stephanie was very rude and would not allow the customer to speak. I asked Stephanie for the regional manager and she refused to give me any information and told me to exit the facility and called the cops. When the cops arrived they gave Stephanie a verbal warning do not be disrespectful to customers during this. Of time.if a regional manager sees this post please contact me at the email address above. Thank you for your time. Thomas< /text>

<username>And Me< /username><Date>1598027641625</Date><rate>1< /rate><Text>3rd time visiting and 2nd time the order was not correct (missing item). Food was average. Service definitely needs work. They do not acknowledge you when giving you the order. You have to ask for napkins and condiments. 1st visit was just coffee and a oatmeal. 2nd visit was on 08/12/2020, ordered about $25 worth and was missing the other 10nuggets for the 20pc. Called ove and over with no answer. Call just hangs up. 3rd visit was today 08/21/2020 I told the person who was taking my order about the last visit and was told that you have to come back the same day for any type of correction. I took it as a loss and ordered 2 chicken biscuits, 2 chicken mcgriddles, 2 sausage mcmuffins with egg and 3 large drinks. I had to ask if everything was in the bag and the women said "Yes, we double check everything". Not to my surprise when I got to work I am missing 1 chicken biscuits and 1 mcgriddle. I will no longer be visiting this location. I can say the one thing you have helped me with is no one in the office will no longer ask me to pick up food on the way in since I only show up with half the orders.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

What's worse is that I always have the manager pack my order and he always messes it up the management shadows onto the employees potential. Just saying.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I told her I placed a online order and try showing my phone to her to see my online order she shut the window, and just look at me till I drove off.

They don't answer their phone they short changed me we always have a problem with this McDonald's they can't never get anything right! I asked for a combo for a 10 piece and the lady didn't charge me for it so at the window I asked for fries and drink at the window and that's when she short changed me.</Text>

this McDonald's is the worst at getting orders correct cannot count the amount of times that I have gone home only to find missing items or wrong items inside of a Box I'm getting tired of having to drive back and ask for my food something needs to be done please double check orders. I should not have to open bags and check for everything< /Text>

So I came in today at exactly 7 a.m. it is actually Monday March 11th 2009 forever morning I come in for my for my morning breakfast and I asked the manager here now. If if she can ask the person in the bathroom if she can ask the lady that cleans the bathroom to wait cuz I had to use the bathroom so she she said I'm sorry she said she couldn't ask she couldn't get she couldn't cheat they can't wait to clean the bathroom they have to clean the bathroom right away so I asked for my money back and I just wanted to leave a review about this to make sure that mr. Arciniaga find out who or why is is a limiting himself and representing his establishment<//Review>

I stopped coming to this McDonald's for a while do to their manager (Miguel). I've never met a staff member that is at a high position and has terrible customer service. I recently came back to give it another try but, he was still working there. He was on and off his cellphone the whole time I was there. Also, not paying attention to whomever needed assistance in the line.
But what annoyed me the most, was that he asked if my meal was for here or to go. Both times he asked, I replied with "for here" and once my order was called, I noticed it was in a to go bag, and didn't even acknowledge it.
Worst service from any staff member I've had.
Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend this location.< /Text>

<Text>Drive thru service is way to slow. It's faster to walk-in and get your order. Spent 30 minutes with 4 cars/orders ahead of me. Manager's attitude was the mindset of it takes however long it takes. I remember when you got your order for free if it took longer than 90 seconds to give it to you in the drive thru.<//Text>< pictures>

McDonald's coffee is only $1 for a medium.  Pretty good tasting coffee. I might add.  Standard McD. Fair beyond that..< /Review>

I went here on a weekday.  Ordered a big Mac combo. I  went to get a sprite on their lobby and it was all carbonated. I asked the cashier and she said they didn't have any sprite.  The customer before me as well. Wanted an iced tea and they told her the same thing.  When they served us our food they didn't give us any napkins and there wasn't any in the lobby as well.<//Text>

first l want to say I'm not a fast food fan. l stop here because l just wanted to use the bathroom. l end up buying coffe and an apple pie. The customer service was excellent, the personel is naturally polite and friendly. -Totally irrelevant to customer service- but l have to add that this the Macdonals with the most good looking ladies l have seen so far.</review>

I ordered from the drive thru. Got home, ate our food and my daughter finds a small screw in her sweet tea. This is ridiculous! She could have swallowed it, or cracked a tooth while eating the ice. This is not acceptable.<//Review>

very bad service.  waiting in line for over 15 mins. and they  atill cant take my order right. i would  give it 0 stars is that was possible.
most of the workers are cleaning the parking lot.  maybe this is why service is very slow. slower than normal.</Text>

The customer service from Regina at the drive thru was outstanding, I was appalled by the extremely long line and almost decided to leave but Regina's kind service made my wait worth the time.</Review>

<Text>1. Front of the door said no toys available.
2. Cashier was counting the register money ontop of the griller.
3. Forgot to give me my chicken nuggets.
4. Every food on my tray ($23 worth) WAS COLD.
5. Sodas were all flat.
I'm not one to give negative feedback on anyone but my gawd their service was so slow. Literally had me wait 10mins before asking me what I'd like to order. Yall need more workers AND warm food!</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2c967d81f23e9:0xf266ae9d7f91b57c</gmapID></record>

Thinking prices should be the same for all Macdonald's as a franchise coffe for instance is about .70 cents then the rest of Macdonald I rather go to south gate on tweedy better service and cheaper I would never come back here< /review>

I just went to this McDonalds drive thru and after waiting for a long time to get our food they didn't even gave me my burger! My brother paid 7 dollars for nothing! How can you forget a burger? There wasnt even any car behind us. Worst McDonalds ever< /Text>

Worst McDonalds ever besides the fact that you have to wait so long at the drive thru they are so over pricing the happy meals, I have gone to other locations and they charge a little less then $5.15 here they charge $6 something, with that money I could just buy a combo meal!</text>

(Translated by Google) They are supposed to have potatoes after 10 a.m. and it's almost 10:30 and they didn't want to sell me some potatoes. I think because I was just going to order that.

Se supone que deben tener papas después de las 10 a.m.. y son casi las 10:30 y no me quisieron vender unas papas. Creo que porque solo iba a ordenar eso.</Review>
