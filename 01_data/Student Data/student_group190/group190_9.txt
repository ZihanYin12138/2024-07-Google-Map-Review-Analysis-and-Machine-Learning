Brian helped resolve issues both times and I truly appreciated his level of professionalism and customer service skills! I really hope he is appreciated! It’s obvious he stands out in level of care over some of the other team members and he deserves to be recognized for the way he represents the company.

Thanks Brian!<//text>< user_name>

Yup as many have stated before, The tall old man with white long hair acts like he is very put out to do his job. Absolutely terrible customer service, and barks at me to stand back on the purple spot but when I came forward, he didn't move back. Also, refused to print my document and told me to use the computers. Manager was nice, but stay away from that dude.</Text>

<text>Incredibly condescending and unhelpful staff. Basic questions about mailing were answered with a flurry of "I-don't-knows" and "Look it up". Multiple times questions would get ignored while they had personal conversations amongst themselves. Cannot recommend this location until the staff learn to do their job.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>FedEx office is very unpleasant experience. The tall old man with white long hair acts like he is very put out to do his job and ship my package. Barks at me to stand back on the purple spot. He could have asked me nicely. Treating me like a criminal when all I want to do is ship my package. He should not be in customer service. Bad representation of Fed Ex. Made me feel uncomfortable, but I needed to ship my package so I dealt with it, and got out of there as fast as I could.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I normally have so much anxiety when dealing with a large print and ship order but Marcio was absolutely the biggest help I could have asked for! From conception of our print job to helping me pack up and ship the prints to my sales team throughout the state, he helped me every step of the way. He is kind. He is patient. He rocks! They all do honestly. I frequently go to this FedEx for business and personal work and every time I always get help or assistance when I need it.

(Also, people you gotta give these guys a break. They deal with a lot of craziness right now with Covid and are just trying to do their best.. like all of us are.)<//text>

LOVE THIS FED EX!!! Thank you Amanda for saving the day!!

My coworker was verbally abused at another print shop and we called ahead to this Fed Ex location to see if they could help us out with our project. Amanda who works there answered the phone and was extremely helpful!!! When my coworker got to the shop, Amanda helped facilitate the printing and was so efficient!!! Thank you!<//Text>

<text>I've been going to this location for years to mail packages or on occasion use the printers. I've only ever had positive experiences here. The staff are helpful and explain the price breaks when you're shipping a package. There's rarely a long line which beats the post office if you're in a hurry. There's usually plenty of parking. The only thing I've been unhappy with are the prices for overnight letters, you're good if it's just a few pages but anything with weight gets pricey (that would be at UPS, the US Post office or any Fedex) so try to go 2 day or ground if you can.< /text><user>108143944146831269049< /user></record>

I wanted to get in and out and that big guy name Brian had a holier than thou attitude. Some heavy set man with greyish beard. He had a line of people but instead of assisting me he pawn me off to a young girl and he walked away from the line. He pawned me off because I asked him to help me print something he refused to do so and instead with a line of people behind me rudely asked me to go the the girl besides him and he walked away. He said she would help me and rudely walked away. I’m thinking he’s a supervisor, if that’s the case he shouldn’t pawn of customers because it’s beneath him to help and b he shouldn’t belittle his employees. I will follow up with corporate on his behavior. Been in here a couple of times and the men seem to always be rude. The women however are very pleasant and understanding.<//text>

Employees here are clueless and extremely slow. If you need to ship/mail - go somewhere else unless you want to wait half an hour for them to print you a label. 2 stars because they have other services (printing, interntet, etc).< /Review>

<Date>1439178345298</Date><Review>I went there yesterday to return some electronic items to a seller. I had packed them in two branded boxes from the seller - but I needed larger boxes into which to put the seller's branded boxes. The customer service person was extremely polite and efficient - although she was on the phone at the same time - trying to help another customer. It sounded as if she had been hung up on a few times by the party she was trying to reach. She was courteous and pleasant - and took the time to find the proper and least expensive boxes for me - and packed my items efficiently. I cannot understand the negative reviews. Her name was Joanna - and I told her I was going to write a review to commend her for her helpfulness even while she was multitasking.<//Review>< rating>

This particular FedEx store has a lot of parking spaces. Staff are helpful and accommodating.  It can be an "extension" of your home office if you need to print something big or something fancy that you cannot do at home. You can send fax, email, etc.  You may do it by yourself or so can have FedEx staff do it for you. There are desktops that you can use which you pay per minute and there are office supplies you can buy.<//Text>

If I could give less than 1 star, I would. I work for a multimillion dollar media company in the area, and I went to FedEx for a last-minute project that needed to be overnight-ed to one of our big clients. In the past, we have gone to FedEx for a similar project, but this time my colleague was stopped at one of the printers by the owner. He was immediately rude and condescending to my colleague. He very loudly told her that we could absolutely not use the printer to print labels and made a huge point of saying that he was the OWNER and that these were HIS PRINTERS. While he was going on his tirade, my colleague continued to politely say, "Okay, can you please help me find a solution? Okay, how can you help me then?" Instead of helping us, he continued making a big stink in the store, speaking to my colleague in a discourteous and patronizing tone. He even had the audacity to say that there were no labels on the sheet my colleague was holding. They were clear labels and had he taken a moment to stop being rude, he would have figured that out. I was so disgusted by his tone and demeanor that I nearly walked out, but this project was very time sensitive and needed the use of a professional-grade printer. Needless to say, we will NEVER use his services again.

Save yourself the trouble, as there are multiple places to get materials printed in the area. And with the negative reputation this place already has, they probably won't be around that long anyway. If you'll notice I'm not the first person to have this same complaint about the owner.

The only saving grace of this place is that the owner finally had another employee help us. Bryan has excellent customer service skills and his boss could really learn from him about how to speak to customers.</Text>

I moved cross country and shipped several packages from here. On one trip I was charged for seven packages when I only shipped six. The woman ringing me up didn't realize it until I was charged and she was left with an extra label. She didn't want to have to restart the sale so she told me the charge would just go back on my card after a few days. It didn't. I waited a few weeks and called FedEx. I was informed I would have to fill out a refund request form. I did that. I included all the information, as well as copies of the receipt and shipping label. It's now been four weeks since I sent that in and NOTHING. I called FedEx again and they have no record of a refund request. Since when can a business just charge you for anything they want and get away with it?
It's been over two months since I was overcharged because of her mistake and I still don't have my money.<//review>

I called the store just asking what the speed is of the Internet connection the guy was rude and said he did not know and he did not have the time to check on it! Really is that not your job? They need a wake up cal from corporate in term of customer relations!!!!
I would never go there!!!<//Text>

Very slow and i have never been in a place of business where there is a culture of rudeness. Ive literally been in there by myself in line and had 2 employees look at me and kept doing whatever they were doing. Finally after 5 minutes someone said ill be with you in a second. Smh.. The people there also talk to you like you are stupid.. Fedex needs to do something.something.</text>

<text>I had a horrible experience with fed ex, they were so rude to me only the Julio and James were nice to me but there was some tall white guy with longish hair who was so rude they gave my package to wrong person I guess they don't always ask for id up in the register I got it delivered to them cause I thought it'll be safer than my house but it was the worst mistake ever. When I went the guy with longish hair was so rude and seemed so careless about what had happened to my package :(<//text>< Pictures>

Good if you need to print or fax something quickly, but if you need shipping service they are the worst. Long lines and the staff are not to pleasant to deal with.< /Text>

I dropped off a box with an HP computer inside for my business.  The KINKOS location accepted the package and a week later I find out that the package is still at the KINKOS location.  My package was damaged there and they wouldn't ship it out because the box had been damaged.  No one contacted me to notify me of the problem.  I had problems at my company because of this and KINKOS blamed me for packing the item wrong.  They refused to repackage it there and send it out and just bill the company.  I had to go back there and pick up the damaged package.  This location is very irresponsible.<//review>

The worst customer service in the world.  I bought three tickets last year for round trip SFO to IST and the flights were cancelled because of the pandemic.  They issued me vouchers but since last year I called dozens times but no one can help me to issue tickets using my vouchers. It takes more than half hour to answer your call and they refer you to another person or tell you to buy it in their office which doesn't exist.  They don't give you their office address. Last year one of their customer service gave me an address and I drove all the way to San Francisco and found out that the address was a parking lot.  I love Turkey but Turkish Airlines has THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE WORLD!<//Text>

<review>Bunch of thieves! I travelled before Pandemic and had to retun in Pandemic but due to Travel Bans no flight were available to Canada, though flight within Canada were on. They just ate my ticket saying I had missed my flight from Montreal to Vancouver while They didnt have a flight to bring me to Canada in the first place. They played the game of go to travel agent and back and forth. After 2 months, they said your ticket was ‘No Show’ in Montreal ignoring the fact they failed to offer a flight to get me to Montreal, so I could catch the flight from there. Do not recommend flying with them.</review><rate>1<//rate>< name>

The worst airline I have ever seen. My mum was traveling through it and had hard time getting in the transit flight, no wheelchair helper was waiting for her which made her miss the next flight. Uncomfortable plane, bad food. I don't advise any body to use Turkish airlines.</review>

I’ve been flying with Turkish Airlines for years but never had this kind of terrible service at SFO check-in counter on Christmas. They don’t even listen passengers even manager is unprofessional. They need to read their website what it says not what they think about policies.👎👎👎<//text>

< review>
Here's a funny story.
So back in February 2019 I have changed my mothers return ticket to move it from March 2019 to July 2019. I payed a fee for the change of the ticket with the exact same credit card I used to purchase the original ticket.
And guess what my mother comes to the airport and tries to check in but she is denied because the airline is asking to show the credit card that was used to make the change to the ticket in order to validate there is no scam! Really?
Of course my mother didn't have my credit card at the check-in in Kiev, nor did I have it being in the US at the moment, because the card was closed about a month ago by the bank and I was issued a new card.

What did the Turkish airlines customer support did when I called them? Nothing! They told you have to drive to the nearest office and show the card. Oh wow, the nearest office is 100 miles away and my mother's plane is in 2 hours. Is there any other resolution? No!

What kind of a process is that?
Why this wasn't mentioned explicitly in the email confirmation I got for the ticket from Turkish Airlines?
What am I supposed to do in the case if I don’t have the credit card anymore?
What is the point of validating the credit card on the return ticket only if the payment for the original ticket was made with the same credit card?
If Turkish Airlines suspects scam why didn’t they block the transaction immediately and have a normal online validation process?
How am I supposed to validate the credit card if I'm not purchasing the ticket for myself and the closest Turkish airlines office is 100 miles away? What about the people that don't have a Turkish airlines office in the radius of 1000 miles from their house?

Horribly organized process with credit card validation, poor support personal and and awful customer service experience.

Thank you Turkish Airlines for the interesting experience!

P.S. I don't know what my mother did, but she was eventually able to board the plane after a 2 hour discussion at check in.<//review>

<Text>Never Turkish airline again.
Its hard to believe, that this airline is a star alliance member. We waited for boarding to our flight from Istanbul to Rome, while two other flights were boarding at the same time right next to each other. Thus, 300 people stood all in front of the gates and it was not possible to figure out, which crowd belonged to which gate. Suddenly the sign for our flight was deleted and the people right next to the gate mentioned, that our gate is closed... no chance to get in, nothing! No last call or any call at all from the gate. The people from our gate were literally disappeared. Although the plane was still at docking station, we couldn’t get in. But we figured out, that this is their way to make a ton of extra money, by charging fees for changing the tickets. We saw a bunch of people at the Turkish Airline help desk after, who had the same problem. Unbelievable and totally unprofessional. We explained them, that we were at the boarding gate an hour before and waited in this big crowd for the other 2 plane flights, but no one believed us and said its our fault. We have to pay a penalty now. Same sentence got the customer standing next to us. In addition, while we finally waited for our overpaid flight, a lady booked business class for her and her two kids and was harassed, because she was black. The desk guy observed her passport several times, lifted it in the air to check for authenticity and critically looked at her. After she had to wait another couple of minutes, they led her board finally and she called him out, that this was totally inappropriate. The guy just turned around and smiled. No apologies, nothing! We were so shocked about this racist behavior. They did not even take a look at all the other passports, where the majority was white. Finally, the lady at the ticket desk did not even bother to put us together, after we realized, that the flight was half empty! We never fly with Turkish airline again, thats for sure. Its worth to pay a little extra, but at least you will be treated with respect and like a human.<//Text><gmapID>0x808f7784da338d0b:0x8c931c64df373c31< /gmapID>< pictures>

I recently tried to make a change to a flight booking that I had made previously, for which Turkish Airlines had already charged my credit card in full 2 months ago. I was told I could not change my ticket without going to the nearest Turkish Airlines office and presenting my credit card in person. The nearest Turkish Airlines office is 45 miles away at SFO. Just Imagine if I lived 300 miles away from SFO or a Turkish Airlines office? How can a company take your money and then insist upon such a ridiculous requirement to make a simple reservation change?<//text>

I recently took Turkish Airlines for the first time to India (with a layover in Istanbul) and I was completely satisfied with price of the ticket and the level of service I received. There's nothing that can done to rush a long flight plan but the flight attendants did a great job in making the travel as comfortable as possible. They had a great selection of movies and the meals were very hearty so there was no worry of going hungry on the flight. I would definitely fly with them again.< /Review>

Called customer service about flying with my small dog was told my particular flight would be fine -  just book, call back, and make the reservation for my dog in cabin.  Booked it, called back, and wouldn't you know?  I could not bring my dog in cabin!  Unbelievably, they would only refund 30euros of a 900euro flight and gave me instructions on how to submit feedback then instructed to call back so agents could mark it urgent to get refunded faster.  Submitted feedback called back once again and they would not mark it urgent.  The WORST customer service and it might have cost me 900 euros.<//text>< Pictures>

All their customer service are non English speakers. Really had hard time to communicate with them over the phone. And I tried calling them over 10 times. When you ask them a question more than one time, they definitely show attitude.< /review>

Worst airline I ever used to fly! They lost my luggage and when I filed a complaint they took few days to reply. I even told them that I had my kids medicines in the bag. They still did not care. Luckily they found my luggage after a week. When I received my bag it was all ripped and my items were damaged! Never flying with this airline again!!
I rather pay a little bit more to fly with Emirates than Turkish.
I  used Turkish airline from SFO to KHI.<//text>

<Text>I wish, I can give them -ve stars, They don't deserve even 1 Star. One of the worst airlines to fly with. Zero customer Service, No Courtesy, No English, No support when flight cancels, No Wheel Chair Support, Baggage was Damaged. I can't even count problems with this Airline, I really don't know how they are flying at international level. They should be banned and go out of business. It's my mistake I chose this airline to fly. Worst experience of my 20 years of flying history. I won't recommend anyone to fly with this airlines as I will never ever fly with them.</Text>< Name>

I love Turkish Airlines and make sure I fly it every time I have the chance. The incredible food, the attentive customer service, the extensive library of content and high quality entertainment system (which is a standard on every long distance international flght) just make them my go to airlines. Over the past 2 years I have been to over 20 countries and over a 80 cities for work and leisure, even if it extends my flight by 1 or 2 hours, I still take Turkish Airlines.</review>

First time and last time flying with them.  What it says on the ticket, is completely different from what is said when checking in at the airport (San Francisco Airport). Even when showing it to them on the ticket, the blaintently lie to your face and say that's not what it says .
I'm my case, the ticket said one Cary on and one personal item.  I had my laptop backpack (smaller than normal backpack) and a standard carry-on bag.  Refused to allow me to take both on flight even after I showed them their own ticket/contract. Kept on saying what it says on the ticket is not true.  Had me repack everything at the airport so I can fit my backpack in the carry on.< /Review>

<review>I was amazed at how unprepared the staff of this major carrier at one of the busiest airports (SFO) were to handle Customers after their flight got cancelled. There was very little flow of information, and nobody out of the 300 or so knew what their fate was. It was complete chaos. We were asked to contact customer service through calls (which was perennially busy) or drop them a mail (which bounced back because their mail box was full). Even after getting in touch with the customer service, we were asked to confirm at the ticketing counter. I felt sorry for the customer reps at the counter though. They were heavily outnumbered.
I can only imagine how miserable the situation for older populace would've been.
If you want reliable backup support or have parents traveling by themselves, I strongly discourage choosing Turkish Airlines.</review>< pics>

<text>worst customer service of all time!!! I bought my tickets with Turkish airlines to San Francisco.Turns out I need to change the airport in Istanbul and I need to transfer my luggage myself from IST to the SAW airport!!! I called the costumer service and all they could say was that you bought the tickets it's your responsibility to transfer your luggage as well as to figure out how to get from one airport to another!!! The least thing that they could do was to provide information about the transfer, specially when both my flights are from Turkish Airline. Extremely disappointed with the customer service!!!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Not to be a privileged American yelling about the quality of service, but my stars this is embarrassing. I tried to book an international flight and I found the best prices through Turkish airlines on a third party website. I got through the whole process surviving the ilogical UI and when I get to payment, of course my card will not let me process; mind you it's 11:30PM. I call the number provided and my bank let's me know that there is nothing wrong from their end, they don't even see attempts of said tranaction. I call Turkish Airlines and I get on the phone with a mean lady prompting me to redo the entire process for an extra $40 because she has to do it for me. LOL fine. It takes about 15 minutes and it still will not go through. I'm told there is a reservation, but prices may change and call back. LOL fine. I call back at 8AM and same thing. I'm told to go to 'office', which is a POBox!!!!!!!????? The other option is to go to Airport to complete payment, which is an hour away. I tried calling, but they're only open for about 3 hours each day. Also, the reservation will expire at 9 AM tomorrow if I don't pay, but there is no way to pay and no where to pay. What's happening??!!!! Please, please do better.</Review>< rating>

Horrible experience when requesting a refund . They tossed my case around amongst themselves for several days. I spoke to Customer relation Natalie who was barely of any help. She told me there is nothing she can do. I need to go to SFO office which means 4 hours of my time. How ridiculous . They seemed very unhelpful. Horrible, I would give 0 star if there is an option< /review>

<Text>DO NOT USE Turkish Airlines the worst company I ever flown with. I had to stay in Istambul 16 hours because the mistakes that the company employees made and  when I wanted to talk with somebody from customer service they were very rude turned their back  and ignored me.
I was traveling from San Francisco to Budapest with Romanian papers and they didn't allow me to bord the plane in Istambul to Budapest because I didn't have a visa. Romania is part of EU we do not need visas to travel any were in Europe. But this guys didn't get it, so I had to buy a different plane ticket to Romania and of course because of that all my return tickets to San Francisco were cancelled and I had to pay another $1400 for a new ticket.
And what is the company answer to all of this? "Carrier shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of carrier to any passenger "
My first and last time flying with this company.
"Thanks" for all the headaches and stress you've given me!< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Turkish employee demanded large amount of cash in order to check my excess bagage.  Wouldn't take credit card.  Turkish airlines customer service rep on phone even said it sounded like he was scamming me but didn't seem too bothered.  Be very wary, this is not what you'd call a first class airline.</text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>Splendid little coffee place in a shady area of the Crossroads shopping center. Not heavily crowded if you're here on a touristy weekend, so it can be a nice getaway. Plenty of outside seating, really good coffee selection, and some nice baked goods, too. Very affordable. Doing a great job with its COVID protocol as well. I'm a fan.<//Text>< pictures>

They have really interesting drinks for the holidays such as peppermint foam with cold brew coffee and a few other seasonal lattes. They also offer gluten free baked goods and have done a really good job with covid to ensure the safety of patrons!< /review>

Excellent coffee selections and pastries.
One of a very few aromatic coffee store in town.
If you ever visit Carmel Crossroads, don’t miss this joint. What I like about it is that they do offer variety of milks if you have lactose intolerance.<//review>

We were passing through and wanted a good cup of coffee. What we found was not what I expected. I was expecting a roastery, locally roasted, on site, good hot coffee. I got not so hot coffee from a carafe and learned that the beans are roasted elsewhere. Nothing wrong with this, just expected more going off the name.< /text>

<Text>This was just okay. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what you'd expect from the name  alone. I expected a local roastery but got a coffee shop with rather weak lukewarm drip (maybe it was the time of day on a SAT PM?).

This is however located in a fantastic outdoor shopping center.<//Text>< Pics>

The coffee is good but the service could be improved. We waited for 15-20 mins for our breakfast sandwiches to be heated. There were other people also waiting around for awhile just to get their food. Not cool.<//review>

Support local businesses. They make great coffee, have decadent fresh pastries every morning, cool open friendly, inclusive setting and the staff is super friendly locals typically working their way through school.

I wouldn't go anywhere else for my coffee.</review>

<Review>Fantastic Darkroast and Fog-lifter and baked goods. I always like to support local coffee houses when I can and this one was not only good, it was comfortable and relaxing. The staff were pleasant and helpful on local directions.
It was my pit stop the two days I was in Carmel... recommended.

Our Mother passed away recently.  We held a Celebration of Life at Legends in her honor.  There was 235 people in attendance.  Korynn and her staff did an excellent job and took total control of the event. The food was delicious.   We highly recommend Legends for any event.  We can't thank her enough!
Thank you again,
Bobby & Melinda</Review>

Food was cold. Server bearly paid attention to our table. Need more training/ servers. Hair should  be up out of the way. Hostess didn't know what she was doing, her uniform was not neat (wrinkled).
In our opinion, the prices were to high.
The views/ place were great.</text>

<text>They have $19.95 dinners for two - excellent choices, good food, generous portions. We had the Jambalaya and the Margarita Chicken. Oddly, the appetizers are one choice for both people. Good though, also generous. We each had the Caesar salad. The bill arrived and was $54 - so I inquired what happened to the $19.95 for two? She happily checked and the bill became $25 including my pint of Sierra Nevada. Now that's unbeatable. It was quiet with good views and lots of sports on multiple big screen TVs. I am telling friends about it because it's a real find and they could use more business. All this on a Sunday evening dinner hour.</text><Time>1302552085033</Time><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><user_name>Greg Malone<//user_name><rate>5</rate><Gmap_id>0x808448fceaf1b5a9:0xca3f5d2eea316a20<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love that they support local schools. That alone is almost worth an extra star, as is their friendly if overworked staff. However, the expensive food straight out of a box simply kills this place. While I have been to several decent group buffet lunches, I recently went to a group brunch that was worse than bad hotel offerings--boxed eggs, greasy sausage, fatty bacon, all for $15 plus tax and tip. Go for a beer and to watch a game and you'll be fine.< /Text>

The golf course is really nice and legends has a very good restaurant and bar. They also are really good for hosting parties. It's a good place to go get some food and a couple cocktails< /review>

The food was very good. Little bit of improvement needed when waiting on people like giving them a menu! There was hardly any salt in the salt shaker in the ketchup was low too.<//text>

<text>I went in on a hot day of 101°. The poor employees had no air conditioning. Employees said the owner hadn't sent anyone to fix it. Also the toaster oven didn't work so we couldn't get our sandwiches toasted. They were out of ice tea. Employees were nice but seems the owner doesn't want to spend on upkeep.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< username>

{'time': 1605233782519, 'text': 'Dear Vee Mar, thank you for providing your feedback. It appears that you had visited our location during the heat wave in August which had lasted over few days. This heat wave had caused several of our equipment to fail most notably the AC. It was very challenging to find technicians during this time; however, we were able to repair the AC on 08/22 at a premium cost. In the interim, we had also brought in a portable AC and two large fans to keep the temperature down. Tireless efforts were made by the ownership to remedy the situation. Regarding the toaster and iced tea being not available, we had purposely turned off some of the equipment that generated excessive heat. We regret that you were not able to enjoy a toasted sandwich and iced tea, however, we hope you would agree that the right course of action was implemented in creating a more manageable environment for our customers and guests. We invite you to visit our location again and you will find all the equipment to be in good repair.\nSubway Management.'}<//response>

The manager there is lovely. She's always so kind and works really hard all the time i go. I like to see that managers work hard. It gives the store a happier vibe. Also, the food was delicious and quick out.<//Text>

<Review>Awesome customer service! I usually go and either Kevin or Brianna helps me out on making my sandwich .  They both know how i like it and what i want on it.  They are both very friendly and always have a smile on their face when greeting the customers as they walk in.  They are both a  good example of customer service.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

<Review>Walked in to a empty store, took five minutes for employees to acknowledge that someone was actually in the building. Ordered a sub of the day with 9 grain honey oat and got a ham sandwich on wheat bread. Staff has horrible powers if recall and there’s no restroom for customers. Go elsewhere to feed and relieve yourselves.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>People are unfriendly here. Only this black guy is really cool, very outgoing, asks how are you.
I placed an online order, not only was the manager like "idk what to tell you, I only got one order" but when I did get my order, it was not how I ordered it. Barely lettuce and yellow peppers. My bf went to pick up the sandwiches and it was 2:26 and they told him it wasn't 230 yet and they would have it ready at 230.
I've eaten here before and the girls act like they don't like their jobs.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2d9f95d1354cf:0xdb70b86f6c685b23< /gmapID><response>None<//response><time>1474418503595<//time></record></dataset><record>

Single staffed employee working in the middle of lunch hour. If we had been in a rush for our sandwiches​, like the people behind us, we would have been late. The worker was well mannered though.< /review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Every morning shift that I've had to deal with have treated me like TRASH. I will never return to this location. It's usually the shift with the black guy and a latina or two Latinas depending on who works there. But the morning shift workers look way to OLD to be working there!! They are miserable and they take there boredom out on customers. My girlfriend was made fun of by these morning shift employees after being asked anything else on the sandwich. She asked for other condiments and the girl employee and black guy laughed amongst each other smirking asking if anything else. This happened on July 20 in the morning.<//Review><rate>1</rate><user>108320745001027848115</user></record>

Im a frequent customer at subway  i often go for a quick meal and have a great exprerience however,  for the past few months my experieces havent been too great whenever i get served by this girl named Brenda I've noticed that the atmosphere changes in the restaraunt and a sort of bitterness is in the enviornment. This girl named Brenda always has a RUDE attitude that just puts me down and sort of ruins my day. Im a really patient person and i try to be understanding, but it really seems like she hates working there! She is very temperamental and overall belittling, she has no patience for ANY of the customers and she’s really REALLY SLOW!! How does it take more than 11mimutes doing one sandwhich?  She made me late going back to work and i would have taken longer if i actually stayed to get the sandwhich. As i was leaving two other groups of people left because she was taking so long and it seemed that she knew that she was taking long too, but didn't do anything to hustle. It seems that she also dampened her co worker’s moods. Overall, I would say the Subway experience with Brenda is negative enough for me to speak out about it. Unfortunately, I hope some corrective actions are taken in any way to bring back the subway I know and love.<//review>

<review>The employees are rude, some seem like they don't know where the products are because two of them have to go in the back for 5 min to find something.  They start some of the sandwich then give it to the next person rudely.<//review>< Pics>

My local spot for sushi, I come here at least once a month. I always order the "sour patch kid" roll it is just loaded with fish, I enjoy how the lemon and jalapeno on top work together. You get that zing and the the jalapeno brings it back down and mellows it out with a little heat. Also their garlic edamame is fantastic.</review>

Great place, but I dropped $55.00 for lunch by myself and still left hungry. Perhaps an "All You Can Eat" sushi option should be on the menu soon.</Text>

Aside from being one of the few sushi places that was open on New Year's Day, the service and quality of sushi provided at Ginza were exactly what I had hoped for. We were sat quickly at the sushi bar and we were well taken care of. The food was delicious and the portions were fair for the price.<//text>

<Review>The quality of sushi here is legit. Menu selection is just the right amount. I have never felt overwhelmed with too many choices here. This is also the first place that I have been to that has nailed the balance of flavors in the sauces used in some rolls. Try the butterfly for a perfect bite size selection of freshness.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Today we were kind of grossed out.  First, the positives.  The service was wonderful.  The taste was terrible though.  The edamame had no taste at all.  The tempura had non-cooked flour on it, and the sushi rice didn't taste that fresh.  A bit surprised based on the reviews!< /Review>

<Text>Wow this tiny whole in the wall was fabulous. Sushi rolls were fresh and they don't skimp. Service was good  but could not get drink refills. There was a busy lunch time crowd, and tables were dirty  but they clean fast for the second wave for customers.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd59c7f5a3893:0x2ebd9b2e20d40de<//gmapID>< user>

This restaurant is the closest sushi restaurant to my apartment. I feel very lucky, because it is also the best sushi in this part of Orange County. I have ordered at least twenty different rolls from a large and varied menu and have never been disappointed. The fish is always super fresh and the service is wonderful. If you read any negative reviews, check the date, because the owner changed a couple of years ago and the current ownership is tops in my book!<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Went to late lunch/early dinner (Happy Hour Time) with my wife.

Location is little dangerous cause it is located on the corner of a big plaza where cars come in. Be very careful when crossing from parking area!!!

Food Quality was very fresh and they did not serve a lot of rice when ordering sushi or rolls. I am giving this place 4 stars cause this is not AYCE place. Out of all the items we ordered...we agreed that the best one was original crunchy roll (Happy Hour price $8.95). LOL!

Service: Was good and our waitress was attentive.

We will come back...for more Crunchy Rolls. LOL!!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Good Sushi, the "Dream Roll" lives up to its name. Staff is friendly. Couple cons about the place which caused the 3 star review: 1.I'm not a fan of the seating arrangements. 2. Received a dirty plate with a bunch of rice stuck to the bottom of it at the beginning. 3. I watched as a sushi chef right at the counter used his teeth to remove the protective sealant cap from a new large bottle of soy sauce. (which I laughed about). However the sushi was very good and I will be giving the place another try.</text>

<Review>This is an incredible place.  Fish is top grade and we ordered about 6 difference dishes and each were great.  Very creative in their dishes and the aromas of each dish was surprising.

Don't pay attention to the old reviews. There is a new owner and this place is awesome again. We go a couple times a month and it's always delicious. The staff is friendly and prompt and the owner honestly cares about the customers and the food quality.</review>

<review>Food was great, service was so slow and it was the end of the night so it wasnt that busy either. By the time the server brought out more ginger that we had asked for, we were already done with our meal and my drink never got refilled either.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>If you like inconsistent food and consistently bad service then go here.  I have given them my last chance, I won't go back for more rubbery nori and sometimes spicy "spicy yellowtail roll" and flat out rude, poor service.  It's a bummer too because this place is within walking distance to my house and we love sushi.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I took my girlfriend here for dinner and we both loved it!

Food: The food was delicious! We ordered a few items.

Edamame (Garlic Spicy) - It was very delicious! The roasted garlic was nice and crispy. The Japanese chilis were just spicy enough without making the dish overpowering. One order of this was just not enough!
Crazy Eel (9pc Roll)- Spicy tuna, avocado, cream cheese topped with BBQ eel, spicy eel sauce. THIS ROLL WAS THE BOMB! The BBQ eel was so tender that it melts in your mouth! This totally had the umami factor to it :) My girlfriend and I could have easily eaten one roll each.
K-1 (9pc Roll) - Spicy tuna, avocado, cilantro topped with albacore, special ponzu sauce. The roll was good. However, I would have preferred it without the cilantro. I really really dislike cilantro. LOL!
Lollipop (6 pc Roll) - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, avocado wrapped with cucumber creamy & hot sauce. This was a very refreshing roll to eat. The fish was fresh. The cucumber was the refreshing part of the roll. The roll was on a toothpick henceforth it was called the lollipop roll.

Service: The waitress was attentive and nice. We were seated quickly when we arrived. The sushi chef even came around to greet us and make sure everything was satisfactory.

Overall, the place was clean and the service was outstanding. The food was AMAZING!</review>

<review>Cute selection but went in there with my kids &husband to look and they charged me $17 for socks that were tagged 8.50 and didn’t want to refund me the difference but told me they would charge me 12$ also my husband was yelled at from the register to raise mask above nose..we have no problem with the masks, I work in customer service myself but it felt rude and just made us want to leave.</review></record></dataset><record>

Best damn shoes I've ever wore.  I hitch hiked from Canada to buy the best shoes possible and I found them here.  They were such a good pair of shoes I met the love of my life on the sidewalk outside because of my killer shoes.   Best shoes you can possibly buy and the best shoes you can wear .  Also I bought a lottery ticket that won me 4,000,000$ in said shoes.   I love these guys and their shoes.<//text>

<Review>The store is great, it's so much more than a shoe store. There is so much to look at and so much original design clothing and one-off products. Plus this is run the way shoe stores used to do it, where somebody actually works with you, brings the shoes out from the back, gives you several suggestions, and works with you to find something awesome. Several times I've walked out of there with a pair of shoes that I never considered and ended up loving them.

Typically I also find something fun or funny to buy for my kids. There's a million hilarious socks, hats and other items that adorn this eclectic kitchy little store!< /Review>< userid>

< review>
My family has been buying all of our shoes here for years. I've known Jesse my whole life and I'm more than happy to support this business. My son really wanted a pair of "Benny" shoes, his favorite movie was the Sandlot and he really wanted a pair of PF Flyers like Benny in the movie but we couldn't find any small enough for him so they ordered them for us. My son was so stoked when I surprised him with his Benny shoes</review>

<Text>Local folk. Great location. Tabletop Ms. Pacman (playable non-covid). Great product selection. Got turned on to a new brand of shoes last year. Lazy and looking online, i found them but no super special pricing or anything. Even the manufacturer site wouldn't load for me. Walking by today I popped in, see exactly what I wanted on the sale rack no less. Purchased and dropped a lil bit into the tip jar cause we local and life's hard and I basically scored brand new shoes instantly cheaper than online. Yes. Thank you for goodness.</Text></record>

I have always been greeted very warmly upon entering the store, and assisted with any and all questions to find the perfect pair of shoes for me. They have a great shoe collection, and more! Support small business!< /Review>

I've been going here since the owner was about 16 years old, I was probably 9 at the time. Great shoes, friendly service, mellow vibes, and of course a quality gumball machine. Highly recommended!</Text>

This shoe store is old school if you consider fantastic customer service and a no-nonsense return policy to be old school. Great selection of quality stylish shoes that are constantly being updated with new models. Great example of the best kind of local business!</text>

<Time>1386580698589< /Time><review>I walked in looking for a pair of Clark Desert boots. I walked up to the front counter and asked if they had any, they pointed me towards a corner display of the store. I stood there looking at them for a maybe a minute when an employee came over to me and asked if I needed anything. I asked to see some of the shoes in what I thought to be my size. He brought out the size I requested, plus a size lower. I tried on both, and decided these shoes ran massively large and I needed a size down. He brought out the next two sizes down and helped me determine which ones fit me better. He was fast, cheerful, and very knowledgeable about shoes and companies. I finally decided on a pair and left. Great experience with helpful and knowledgeable employees who helped me have a great experience.</review>< UserId.>

{'time': 1510076352409, 'text': "Thank you for the compliment and the critique.  I apologize if you encountered a streak of no sizes in the shoes you wanted.  Sometimes the shoe gods are cruel ;).  But seriously its my least favorite thing to not have sizes for our customers.  The truth is we order all our shoes 6-8 months in advance off estimations.  Once we receive them, most of them aren't available to fill in, AND if they are seasonal, its even harder because they are limited and then discontinued after a short while.  Hopefully at the very least our customer service was friendly and willing to help.  I take the full blame for not having your size!  Good luck out there on your shoe hunt.  Please feel free to contact us if you'd like to Special Order one of the shoes we didn't have for you."}</response>

Love this butcher shop and the family that runs it! Just finished cooking up 4 big slabs of country breakfast sausage. Worth a stop on your way through susanville. Bring a cooler if your from out of town. Easily fill up your yeti! You will not be disappointed.</review>

<Review>I love coming in here. They have a wide range of sauces, seasonings and rubs that will please any grill master. The meat is always fresh and the prices are fair.  Plus the employees are always so nice and helpful. I always recommend Idaho to anyone who wants to eat local.< /Review>< Pictures>

This is a real, old time butcher shop. Local meats, cut to order! Clean and easy, fresh produce, tons of great spices and sauces . Nice helpful people, friendly and full of great ideas. I love this place. They also do game processing, and they make sausages and salami, so delicious. Go to Idaho Market, you'll be back.!<//review>

Wow!  A real butcher shop that'll cut and trim meat to order, sell you a half a beef, prep a pig for roasting or take care of your game.  Plus there's a huge selection of condiments and seasonings on the shelf's for all your needs!  Great folks behind the counter... and much more!<//text>

<review>Clark is responsive to competing concerns:  using the least toxic materials to get the job done, and keeping armies of Argentine ants out of my home, (with apologies to Argentina, a lovely country.) If you've ever seen crumbs of food pulsing with ants or followed a trail into cupboards to find an infestation requiring throwing away anything not in cans, you will value regular service from Clark.  Since I began the contract, there have been no problems and they are careful about where they spray outside, avoiding fruit trees and vegetable planters. Peace of mind:  call them and they come over to address the issue, explaining their work clearly and answering questions. They establish outside perimeters the ants don't cross.<//review><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>117210994891680877230</UserId.></record>

<Review>Wonderful speedy service.  Took care of our ants, spiders and mice.  We have yearly service and Jesus our technician is full of knowledge and cares that we don’t have these critters come back.  He’s friendly, pleasant and easy to talk to.  Thank you!<//Review>< Time>

We used Clark Pest Control to get rid of rats in attic and basement. They did a really great job. Whenever we hear any noise in attic they can come and help us handle it in a very timely manner. (Usually within a day)< /Text>

<Text>My family has done business with Clark Pest Control for over sixteen years.  We have been pleased with their services.  The technicians are knowledgeable and friendly.  If there is ever a problem Clark sends out someone to take care of it right away.  I would recommend their services to everyone.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1603381844678, 'text': 'Thank you David for sharing your experience and your five star review!'}< /Resp>< date>

We have been using Clark at our business and home locations for over 20 years. They are one of the best service companies around. Eric Schuerman has been our technician for many years. He is amazingly thorough. If we have any issues he comes out immediately. His pleasant, helpful and engaging manner makes any issue we may face ever so easy to solve. He give our highest positive recommendation to Eric and the Clark Team.<//Review>

Logan Cullan-best ever!!! We’ve been customers for years and recommend Clark to all of our family and friends.
If anyone is looking for a great pest control company, Clark is the best. We actually tried a different company for a month. After they came, the spiders and ants all moved in. I called Clark immediately!
No more problems.< /Text>

I have had the pleasure of having Torrance here. He is so incredibly thorough, kind and knows the business. He takes his time, and looks both inside and outside the house. He always calls to let me know if he is running late. He is a very pleasant and intelligent person.

He is the consummate professional and a major asset to Clark.

<Text>The service does a good job of keeping ants and spiders to a minimum, esp. inside the house.   The technicians are respectful and do their work quickly and unobtrusively.  If you call for special needs, you get a real person on phone right away. Free periodic termite inspection is a nice bonus.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>They are professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  I haven't had a serious bug problem in years.  We have a couple of fruit trees in our yard and when the bugs move in Clark moves them back out.
I highly recommend their service.<//text>< rating>

We've used Clark for many years, and have only experienced minor indoor pest (ant) problems a couple of times.  And when there is an issue, Clark is very responsive and comes out right away (within a day in our case) to provide some additional treatment, and the problem has gone away.  I would not use anyone else for pest control.< /Text>

I have used Clark pest control in Livermore for extended periods of time. Today I had Joshua smith inspector come to my home and he did an excellent inspection pointed out areas that he fixed so the future problems will be minimal or none. I was very happy with the service and highly recommend choosing Clark pest control in Livermore !

Thank you for the service ..<//review>

I hired Clarks May 2019.My daughter recommended them to me. She was serviced by someone from corporate who placed outside poison containers in her yard. My main concern was that a rodent of some kind
got into my house while I was carrying my groceries through my back door.
Till this  day the critter remains in my home. The outside spraying seems adequate. Recently there have been mice found on my back porch. There has not been any placement of anything outside of my home to deter or kill the rodents that are occuring recently.<//Text>

I hate having bugs in the home so the 1st call I made when I purchased my home in 2005 was to Clark Pest Control.  I was a regular customer with them before and was familiar with their service plans. I schedule a bimonthly plan with them and continue to be a satisfied customer.<//text>

Any and every time I've called with a concern it is addressed immediately. Michael has been my regular guy since we've started service a couple years ago. He is always extremely professional, kind and courteous. He takes the time to answer all my questions. And the very very rare occasion he doesn't have an answer, he will find it immediately.</Review>

We do have a large yard with a lot of trees and shrubs, however either the product being used is not working very well or they simply are not spending the time needed to do a good job.

<Text>Clark delivered as promised - quickly! Other companies were not available as quickly as Clark. The service professional explained everything about the service then proceeded to handle the flea infestation. It took several applications, but we are finally rid of the bugs. My tenant is happy and I am happy! You might find a less expensive service, but you won't find a better one.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Excellent evaluation and treatment for swarming ants and spiders within the house, around foundation, under house and exterior.  Now for 18 mos, Clark has come, with notice, regularly to spray the perimeter of outside of house.  I can even leave dirty dishes in the sink now!<//Text>

We were invaded by ants inside the house several times.  Each time Clark came out promptly and worked on the problem.  As far as I am concerned, our house is sitting on top of multiple ant hills and we need Clark's protection.<//review>

My love for Pad Thai started at UC Berkley and I blame my little sister for the obsession. Desperate to find a good enough thai place in the San Fernando Valley I did my research and this little place came up... I was super excited to try it. Fast foward to today I have had their Pad Thai a couple of time and they never ever disappoint. All the employees are nice, respectful and accommodating.

Came in last week finally, starving.
I was excited to see they had lunch specials coooool.
$8 for certain entree opinions including the "pad Thai" with rice and a small veggy soup or salad.
Good for the price of course.
The portion was pretty big I could t really finish it but I had to eat every bit with spicy sauce and peppers.
The pad Thai was tasteless.
I ordered chicken but I couldn't seem to distinguish the taste lol. Looked and tasted like cheap chicken or beef or pork lol.

The veggy soup was delicious though, I would come back and maybe give em better stars on other dishes.
This one was just bad.

Service was ok, it's not a 5 star restaurant so clearly do t expect much.</review>< userid>

If you want authentic Thai food that comes pretty quick, make a visit. It's a tiny place. It makes me like it more. Get the classics for your 1st try and go from there. The best.<//text>

These guys do Thai food right. You'll also note that they are VERY conscientious about customer service. Very rare any more. They work hard and do care - you see it in their sinceeity when they serve. Highly recommend. I had Tom Yum Kai - very nice (and I've jad it in many locations).< /review>

<review>I am a foodie, which makes me very picky about what I eat. This place is hands down the best Thai food in the whole valley! My personal favorite is their Spicy Coconut Chicken Soup. I get it every time with an additional dish (change it up every time) and I'm never disappointed. They have a wide variety of traditional dishes that are all executed very well.

The service is great as well. It's been a family owned restaurant for years. The owner, Chuck, is always there making sure the food is top quality and the customers are well attended.

By the way, the food won't break your wallet. You get the most bang for your buck here.< /review>< Pics>

The waitress was very attentive. They have been around for over 30 years. It is owned by a family. The food came out promptly and it was very good. The presentation of the food was very planned and poised making it more delightful to eat, and I like how they make their peanut sauce. The prices are reasonable. And the portion sizes are a good amount. Take your family take your friends and enjoy some great Thai food and great service.< /text>

Love this place! Been eating here since I was about 4 years old. Always good and the Thai Tea is amazing. Order the garlic chicken (without lettuce, they put more chicken if you say that). You wont regret it!!!</Text>

Food to go over the past weekend was great! Huge portions with a lot to spare for 2 of us. Service was prompt and attentive. Max wait was 20 minutes. ..... and to think Dome is around the corner from us.....will always patronize Dome. A MUST!</Text>

The servers are so nice and the food is delicious. I would recommend the pad thai, pad-se-ew, and massaman curry. A place to go if you're in Sylmar (there's a nice park and disc golf course just down the street if you want more to do).<//Review>

I really wanted to like this place because I absolutely love Thai food, but despite my open mind.....I found a hair cooked in with my fried rice after I was half way through.  Gross!!  Not only that the rice is a weird color and the chicken leaves a lot to be desired.  I would never eat here again.</text>

I was surprised to find this quiet, tranquil and clean restaurant in Sylmar. Its great if you are a local not wanting to drive too far for Thai. The portions are okay but I've gotten more elsewhere.  Also 1 of the 3 waitresses is always moody/rude ( don't know name but young and chunky). This place has potential but also has place for improvement.</Text>

I always google vegan eats around me because there’s really nothing here in sylmar. Dome pachana always pops up and I finally built up the courage to call and ask and unfortunetly I didn’t catch the chicks name but she was so helpful in accommodating and veganizing some food with me. Long story short, super friendly staff, they are so helpful and my food was delicious. ☮️ & 💟</Text>

<Review>Love this family owned restaurant! Try their tom yum soup..It's delicious & my family's favorite...Dining in, I love their presentation with the satay chicken/beef..My favorite is their BBQ chicken & pork..Order the dinner/lunch special..really worth it for the price...It comes with a choice of  wonton soup or salad, white rice or fried rice, & comes with fried wonton/eggroll appetizer....I've probably ate everything on their menu & pretty good..no complaints 😊 & they also filmed Son of Anarchy here...< /Review>< Pictures>

Update....still love it, add d a photo of their pink milk  drink.....Ilove this place! The food is amazing! (I personally love the curry fried rice and BBQ pork best) When my husband and I started dating I introduced him to Dome Pochana and he immediately became addicted. We even used them to cater our wedding and it was done perfectly, they went above and beyond our expectations! You should not leave Sylmar without trying this place (it should get more than 5 stars).< /Text>

<name>Brunelle Tölva< /name><userid>113947927252356874732</userid><review>Showed up with some friends a little over an hour before closing on a Wednesday.  Parking lot was full, they quoted a 25 minute wait for a table.  We took a walk, came back, they seated us, brought drinks, then a very long wait to place our order.  After we ordered, there was again a very long wait for our food.  Our waitress came by to let us know the kitchen was closing before our food came out.  When it did, over 50 minutes after we were seated, everything was tasty, though not hot - the fries and burgers were warm-ish.  We didn't get the 'endless fries' promised because the kitchen closed before we were served.  Our waitress was friendly but completely overwhelmed.  Until they are able to hire more staff, only go here if you're patient or want to get the most pub atmosphere for your dollar while you wait for your food.  The table next to us had their Thinkpads out.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Rating>3</Rating>< resp>

Awesome pizza and beer.

Deep dish is highly recommend. My personal favorite is their special. Their beer selection is outstanding, all of them are good.

They have outside seating during shelter in place and there are no reservations. First cone first served.</Text>

<text>A nice place for enjoying dinner with family and friends. Plenty of food options to select from and a decent selection of drinks. Highly recommend the house crafts if you are into them.
We have been to the place mutiple times and have mostly good experiences to talk about.
For a place that does not take reservations the overall time to seat people and then the serving staff to take orders and bring in atleast the drinks is far too long. One needs to be highly motivated to wait through the slow turn around time.
Would recommend tying Extra hot wings, tacos and sweet potato fries and parmesan crusted chicken.</text>< pictures>

Their covered patio area is open for outdoor dining.
Inside, they have pens in sanitized cup and after one used a pen you put it in "used" cup.

We ordered take out, when we get home what a disappointment, we wanted a ribeye median rare and we get it well done, what a waste for such a nice cut, it was so dry and hard, impossible to eat.  I called and they ask me if I wanted a replacement or refund, I told them we want the meal because we were  hungry, after couple minutes they told us that they are out of ribeye, so we got the refund but after wait for the order be ready, get home, call back, and all more that one hour was pass.  It was a hard time after that to start thinking again what to eat and where. Uggg.
I go there regularly and had good experiences.  I hope they pay more attention with the orders.<//Text>

<text>Food:
The food was great. Haply hours makes it worth while. The pizzas were good here and are part of the happy hour meal.

Service:
Amazing service. Waiter was always checking up on you.

Seating:
The bar section is pretty big. You have booths, high tables and of course the bar. They only do happy hours at the bar side. The dining seat side is even bigger and made up of booths and tables. Plenty of seats.

Parking:
There is not enough parking. You may end up driving around before you find parking during peak hours.</text><user_id>107034503442569886916</user_id>< user_name>

The food was good.  I believe they were having an off day with service and communication with the back of the house.  The server and manager were apologetic and comped my meal.  We were was also offered a free dessert.<//Text>

<review>Really delicious food, a great wait staff and a n elegant and homely atmosphere.

I ordered the prime rib, which had a slight mix up in the order line, but the staff made sure to make it up to me with a free appetizer.  Overall felt very cared for and had a great experience.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk7l0V7Je4NuNmb_diMc854vc-ABNr3GrS4kBO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808fb5b6a473be33:0x48df16195b22c277</GmapID></record>

<text>Service was slow and they mixed up our orders many times. Food was decent at best, my father asked for water 3 times and they only got it to us when they got us our check. The Monkey Bread Pizookie was really good though</text>< pictures>

Nice place to hangout after work. Place gets very busy during happy hour and dinner hours. Parking is a pain during busy hours. There are lot of good selection of Beers and Appetizers. Some are great like their Stuffed Mushroom, some are OK. I like their flat bread pizzas as well. Place is great for office parties and watching sports as well. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

Our reservation was at 630pm. 715 pm half of our table still hadn't ordered. When our food was served it was half missing and some items were wrong.  By the time we got our food half the table was done eating. It is now 830pm we are here celebrating 2 birthdays and dessert was not even offered. En route to the restroom (was was a mess) there were stacked dirty dishes everywhere. Covering the server stations and vacant tables. All in all not a great experience. We used to eat here more often. This experience is reminding us why we don't. The pic is just one of the tables and areas I passed. It was like that the whole time we were dining.</review>

Personally love the food here and the drink selection.. And i like the new bj app which shows your due payment and everything.. Found an extra item on the check/bill using the app and we asked them to remove it even before the server got me the actual check<//Text>

Service was good, drinks were good. Food was okay.

Avocado Rolls: 4/5
This one is new to me, and I like it! I think the avocados were a bit too ripe though because it had more of a brown color than usual. But overall still tasty! It comes with a sweet dipping sauce.

Crispy Calamari: 3/5
I think it's pretty average. Very oily but still not too bad.

Chicken Pot Stickers: 1/5
I was not a fan of these. They were dry and the skin was super thick. It's the exact opposite of appetizing.

Pizookie: 2/5
Tuesdays are $3 pizookie day. We got the salted caramel and peanut butter s'mores pizookie. Honestly, it's just EXTREMELY sweet--we couldn't even finish a shared one. The cookie is also over-baked because it was hard and pretty much stuck to the pan.

It can get pretty pricey dining in here. I would probably not seek out this place unless I have a sweet tooth on a Tuesday craving for a pizookie.<//text>

Food was good! I ordered the fresh atlantic salmon. Strawberry Margarita was amazing. I would recommend. The pizookie was great too. 👍🏻

Only caveat is they are busy on a Friday night.</review>

we went there to celebrate our son birthday. we ordered five meals. after we waited 45 minutes for the food I looked for our waitress. I asked where is our food and she changed in the kitchen, after few minutes she came with cold food. we ordered 5 meals, only one of them was what we ordered. after hour and a half we left the place without food and super disappointed. we couldn't wait more with two starving kids...
I should mention that all the tables around us got they food in reasonable time.</Text>

Last Saturday, I ordered a Large Combination Pizza to go. The pizza was half price and it tasted like half price.  The crust was doughy,  not enough cheese and sauce.  The toppings was just okay. I paid 17.14 tax included for this.  I can't imagine anyone willing to spend over 30 dollars for this pizza when the half off promo ends. Never had Dominoes, but I assume the taste is similar.  JUST GUESSING!!</Review>

<Review>First time experiencing a BJs so I myself was excited! We came in around lunch time. Before you you it it was 2 hrs later and a 3 course meal later. Really enjoyed ourselves! Very relaxing atmosphere super great service. Very clean restaurant! Our Waiter Nicholas was AMAZING! He did such a great job! Very respectful and genuine. He was attentive and fast. He deserves a promotion! One of the best customer service I've encountered. Our food was great very big portions. Started with the Wisconsin cheese curds, and had the Mahi Mahi tacos, Jumbaliya, and the turmic califlower for entree. For dessert the Monkey Bread is a MUST! Very pleased. Highly recommend. Thanks again Nicholas< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHS7HI_a1LbV3XGUgzBifo9RwzH4Ntc5VQ-dbs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5EJt1XQOT0RONL6SwOvf8bFW8okrFxph8R-MO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvMQUPWyNsSiRPwz8sCVpEiaXVmCHvaagQwx2T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP21Mxo1b9IjsqxOQakUaGn_s-rG2oz9kmzvSSV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm1xnmRmSFWijM-Gn9Ssb4nuaRDJHeK0i4DgaV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9bWMQroXhdamctKHdEeEqdHlgWKTkPyn4uvJF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Came here for a pre-valentines day dinner with my wife. The food was excellent and the environment was lovely. It’s not fast food cheap but for the quality you get, it’s a steal. My wife and I loved it! We also go a 20% discount on our bill because a random lady handed us a gift card.
One thing to note though is that parking can be an issue on especially busy days. It took us roughly 15minutes to get a parking spot. Take this into consideration when planning your trip.
Overall though (despite the parking issues), we had a 5 ⭐️ experience.< /review><Date>1581778356368</Date></record>

Amazing variety. Reasonable prices. Our particular server was not the best but he tried. I ate the full rack of ribs by myself which seems weird but wasn't really all that much meat on it.<//Review>

Our reservation was at 630pm. 715 pm half of our table still hadn't ordered. When our food was served it was half missing and some items were wrong.  By the time we got our food half the table was done eating. It is now 830pm we are here celebrating 2 birthdays and dessert was not even offered. En route to the restroom (was was a mess) there were stacked dirty dishes everywhere. Covering the server stations and vacant tables. All in all not a great experience. We used to eat here more often. This experience is reminding us why we don't. The pic is just one of the tables and areas I passed. It was like that the whole time we were dining.</Text>

<Review>Fist off let me say that the food and drinks were pretty good. The service was not bad as well. Except for the waiter manager who was there on the evening of May 09, 2019. One star goes to her. And here is how she earned it. After ordering a couple of beers, me and my buddy were asked to show the IDs. No issues with that. However, because we were out of state, the waitress said that she had to run them by her manager and wanted to take the IDs with her. I was not comfortable letting her go with our IDs and asked manager to come by instead and take a look. You could tell by the manager's face she was not happy about having to come to our table. She took the IDs, closely looked at them, then back at us, then back at the IDs, then back at us and then started questioning us about what was our business coming to the area and what city we were from and when we came. All the time brazenly looking us in the eye. The whole interaction felt like an interrogation by an unfriendly police officer strongly suspecting you of something you did not do. So here ya go. Well deserved one star.

Serve responsibly. Sure. But also learn to do it respectfully and know your boundaries.</Review>< Pics>

I love this place. I come here after work a lot since I work late and they're open, but it's really nice to have a decent restaurant choice at 10PM. They brew their own root beer and cream soda, which are fantastic, and actually have a low calorie menu section with worth while options. I personally like the lemon herb chicken and asparagus with zucchini noodles.</review>

Glorified Denny's.  They shouldn't be open so late. It's like they're not even trying. It took the server over 7 minutes minimum to greet us. She had little help from her team. She appeared to be responsible for like 10 tables. I had to repeatedly flag down people to help.  She got the drink order wrong. She said goodbye before she ran our card.

An overpriced waste of money and.< /Review>

Very nice looking, almost upscale.
Just at the entrance of the Apple Infinite loop.
This place has a responsibility on its shoulders, I'd say. But it can bear it.
Make sure to stop here for a good beer and if you need, the food is quite good, as well.</Review>

Food was good, the homemade Root beer was excellent! The service at the bar was not so great as the bartenders didn't really acknowledge anyone we had to keep getting their attention and having been a bartender for many years myself made the service even more disappointing.<//Text>

Extensive menu with lots of American Staples and 1000+ calorie entrees or even appetizer. Similar to the cheesecake factory, without the cheesecake but with pizookies instead and more beer choices.< /Review>

It would have been a one-star, but I think they had a particularly bad night when I visited, so upgraded to two stars.

This was a Saturday night so you would think they would be ready for higher volume of crowd. But it was chaos. The waiters were just running around and could not keep up with customers. And, they were so distracted, giving the right order or getting a refill of a beer would be a painful process. Food came out wrong and in the wrong order. Next food was just too cold. And in the middle of the chaos and trying to rush one of the waiters dropped 3 water glasses from a tray (full of water) - huge mess.

Horrible experience for what was supposed to be a fun night out. I mean, seriously. It could have been a comedy movie - it's just that you wouldn't want to be "in" it.

They realized how bad it was, they gave us free dessert.< /Text>

I don't regularly eat here but I think I had the best salad I've ever had!
The Seared Ahi Salad was incredible! Big portion and so much flavor!
I will definitely be back to have it again.<//Review>

Ahhh!!! Rrrribssssss.
And recently every Thursday, they begin to give a (free, even to-go) dessert after your dinner.(because I came during dinner hours.)
Gooooosh, I'm pretty sure coming back Ah-huh!< /Text>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>I went here with my friends and there was a few flaws noticeable that I saw.
The positive thing here, the host knew my name, which is great, probably because of reservation. When I reserved it as a table of three, I got some table that fits ten people with the host behind me holding eleven menus. I asked to removed the extra menus, but just left. The food here is  excellent, but the service is a bit off. With ordering three glasses of water, I only got two, which the third one never arrived, even though our server promised to get us the third glass. Ordering is kind of slow when I only see about two or three groups of people, not a lot in general. The server arrived half an hour after our arrival. We made three orders. My order came first, then one of my friend's order arrived, but the third meal never arrived. Dessert was a pizookie, which we were about to order, but the server gave us a random pizookie without asking the flavor. Our bill was about $96 including tax. Even with the coupon, I still had to pay. I remember not ordering three of the dishes that says I ordered it. I paid $97, which one dollar is for tips to the chef. We left at 2:30 and arrived at 11:00. Without the third meal, we left, with my friend thirsty and starving.

Overall, I say the food is great, I think the service might have issues.< /Text>< Pictures>

Casual and friendly, with interesting menu and drink options. Great list of local craft beers, especially when they cost only$4 during happy hour! If you want to watch sports this is also a great place to be, or you can hang out with a friend, or a group, and indulge in as much tasty 🍺 as you like. Good for conversations and meet ups, but mainly beer, sports, and no nonsense food in a convivial atmosphere.</Text>

Ordered takeout pasta. Parking in the evening is always bad, you just have to use valet. They prepared the wrong item, had to wait further for the correct item. But they were courteous to give 50% discount. Shrimp pasta dish was very good. They surprisingly also have many veg choices.< /text>

Side room for parties is very spacious.  Our group of 30+ people was more than enough to share with 2 other parties next to us.  Service was pretty good, drinks were brought out to our party members without delay and shortly after the appetizers and main course came within reasonable time.</Review>

Pretty standard food quality with an extensive menu. The monthly beer dinners are really fun because they select a type of beer and create a special pairing menu. Usually not too crowded inside, but parking is awful. The last time I was there, they had valet in the parking lot, but not sure how much it costs.< /text>

This place is a hit or miss. Food quality is always good which is a definite plus, but only if you have a decent server that listens/cares. I say the word "care" on purpose since the goal is getting your order and food as fast as possible when instead it should be making sure your order is correct and that your dining experience is pleasant. Food great, service below average.</text>

Took the family here tonight. Food was good as any other BJ location. Beer was great. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the pork ribs were cooked the same you can find at any other chain bar and grill with the exception of the awesome caramelized bbq sauce.

The service was absolutely awful, we had a waiter named Vincent. He was young and it is valentines day so were not bashing him, just sharing our experience. We asked to order twice, each time he said yes and walked to another table. Fast forward 30 to 40 minutes I just ordered with the take out section. Our waiter visited us twice and never came back around. He even asked us if we wanted our check after we finished our appetizers. Not seeking retribution, just sharing our experience.</Text>

<review>We used to like it here but its not that good anymore. The burgers however are good. Too bad they dont have the thin cut fries anymore. They were worth the trip.

Service is hit or miss but the check-in is the most unfriendly thing you can imagine. They irritate us each and every time. Mildly put.

Great service! I go at least twice a month with a friend around 1:00 when the crowd dies down. My only complaint is they need more regular food choices besides a burger and fries<//text>

They've done a great job with service every time I eat food here or grab take out. The food is good for large parties and the environment is good for small outings as well. Very versatile and keeps me coming back for more.<//review>

I go every Tuesday for their half off wine and $3 pizookies !!! Great happy hour, great house beer and a wonderful vibe. Better than Applebee’s but not as fancy as Cheesecake. Perfect balance.< /Text>

I always enjoy BJ's, and tonight was no exception. The food was delicious as always, and the service was friendly, despite being a little slow. Deducting a couple stars because we didn't get checked on while eating, my friend's food was late, and although we we're offered free Pizookies mine was forgotten about and we waited 15 minutes for the kitchen to bake a new one. I asked for it to go, and they gave it to me without ice cream. Will come back anyways, the food and good times are always enjoyable.< /review>

Took the family here tonight. Food was good as any other BJ location. Beer was great. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the pork ribs were cooked the same you can find at any other chain bar and grill with the exception of the awesome caramelized bbq sauce.

The service was absolutely awful, we had a waiter named Vincent. He was young and it is valentines day so were not bashing him, just sharing our experience. We asked to order twice, each time he said yes and walked to another table. Fast forward 30 to 40 minutes I just ordered with the take out section. Our waiter visited us twice and never came back around. He even asked us if we wanted our check after we finished our appetizers. Not seeking retribution, just sharing our experience.</text>

BJ's feels upscale but delivers an average experience.  The staff are helpful and attentive, but the food is nothing special.  We had food allergy requests that were not entirely taken care of; cross contamination appears to be an issue in their kitchen.  In this case, sesame seeds were present on an item that the server and manager represented would be simply grilled chicken, with nothing more than salt and the oil used on the pan.  Management was made aware of the issue, but had no explanation.<//review>

Always great food and service here.   Probably the busiest BJ's I've been to.    It has a lovely outdoor seating area where you can watch all the foot traffic from Apple pass by.   BJ's are definitely not for folks with any kind of hearing impairment.   Always loud.   Great place to watch sports at the bar though!<//Review>

Great place for a dinner with friends. The menu choices varies from appetizer to great burgers. Also good selection of beers of course. The prices are on the average, and the food quality is good. Definitely one of my favourite places in the area.<//text>

We used to like it here but its not that good anymore. The burgers however are good. Too bad they dont have the thin cut fries anymore. They were worth the trip.

Service is hit or miss but the check-in is the most unfriendly thing you can imagine. They irritate us each and every time. Mildly put.

The food is good however so sometimes we decide to put up with the hostile staff but it always leaves a bad taste even before you eat.

Update May 2019.. They seem to have made changes to front staff and more servers. Much better.</review>

<review>Food was very good. I had the deep dish ziti which was fabulous! So much flavor and the portion was huge. My sister raved about the shrimp scampi with lots of garlic. My Mom had salmon and said it was rather dry. That was a bummer because we were celebrating her 93rd Birthday!! The cocktails were very good as well. Service was okay, nothing extraordinary. They did bring a Pizookie which is a cross between a cookie and a pizza served in a cute iron skillet with vanilla ice cream. Overall a very nice evening with family and friends.</review>< Pictures>

Surprisingly there are a couple pages of good, healthier food on the menu, as well as the ribs, etc.  Many choices of drinks, of course.  Waiter was very helpful.  Interesting appetizers as well.  Not an inexpensive place, however.</Text>

I don't know if the staff here drained the card  or at the restaurant it was purchased but I wanted to make it known in case others experience the same thing. On top of that, our food was overcooked and dry and we had to get the attention of our waiter to bring us a steak knife so we could actually eat our meal.

I was here around 6 pm on 7/23/19 for a friends birthday party. My friend and I have called over an hour prior to going there to reserve a table for 10 people. The lady who picked up the phone call said she wasn't sure if she was allowed to do that, so she said she will speak with our manager and left us on hold for 15 MINUTES. After about 7 minutes, my friend and I decided to just drive there since we didn't live that far and when we walked into the restaurant, we ended the phone call that we were on for over 15 minutes. We asked the person at the front and it was the same lady who we had just talked with on the phone since she immediately recognized us and started laughing to her coworkers about how we decided to come in the restaurant in front of our faces. She said there would be a table ready by 6:30, so we left and met with the other people who were attending the party. We arrived to bj's at 6:33 exactly and the same lady at the front was getting very mad about how she texted us that the table was ready a few minutes ago and started asking us where we went. She then told us that since we were a few minutes late, we had to wait another 30 minutes for the table to be ready. When we finally got to sit at the table, the waiter took over 20 minutes to come ask us what we wanted to drink, and since it took so long, we just ordered the food right away. The food took over 30 minutes to come, and also two of the orders were completely wrong, so they had to wait another 20 minutes for their food to be ready. When my friend corrected the waiter that he had been given the wrong order, the waiter started to tell my friend that he had ordered something else, which was just completely wrong. My friend paid for everyone since it was his birthday. My friend brought $200 exactly since we weren't expecting the bill to be that high since most people were sharing meals. The total bill came out to $197. Since my friend had only brought $200, he couldn't give a reasonable amount for a  tip, so he just decided to pay the $200 fully and told the waiter to keep the change and thanked him. A few minutes later, the waiter returned my friends $3 and said "you're going to need this more than I do". THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. I understand the tip should have been higher, but my friend did not bring enough money, so there was nothing he could do. Tipping waiters is customary, even though everyone should tip, IT IS NOT REQUIRED and SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED BY A WAITER. SO FOR THE WAITER TO COME BACK WITH THE MONEY AND SAY A STATEMENT LIKE THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. I already have let a lot of friends and family who dine at bj's very often know about this and they said they will definitely not be coming back.< /Text>

<text>Really want to like this place, great menu selection, ambience and space. However, the service is shockingly slow even at quiet times, plenty of staff but they just stand around chatting to each other, or they don’t seem to know what they are doing. We had to go ask to be served after 20 minutes at a quiet time. Such a shame.</text>< Pics>

Everytime I come here, I have the same exact feeling.. parking situation is bad, food is below average, service is hit-or-miss, ambience is like a typical diner but prices are way above average.</review>

< Review>
Awful service and it has been three times in a row. Today we got a seat and waited for over  10min without a server. We had to ask for somebody and he came to the table with a terrible attitude. He literally told us “what do you want”... we ordered drinks and food but after waiting for additional 15min we decided to leave. We didnt even get  water.

What a terrible service... Its a shame because I like their food</Review>

Definitely a wait time if there ever is a holiday, so plan ahead. Otherwise I've never had any issues with the food the..maybe 20 times I've been there? Make sure you reserve well in advance to guarantee a seat!<//text>

Stereotypical American/Brew house food. However, this BJ's excels in that the service and atmosphere is second to none.< /Text>

We really enjoyed the new salad selections and follwed it up with their signature Pizzoki!  Yuumy.  My hubby said the dressing on his shrimp tacos had an odd bite to it. (peppery bite).

Very busy for a Tue night, food took a long time to arrive, I had the seared ahi tuna salad, the dressing was salty, the crust on the ahi was salty as well. Not sure if I would go back, too many restaurants that I have yet to try.<//Text>

Great place to hang out and have a bite to eat with a beer after work, especially if you are on campus. Beer selection is vast, and, being from the UK, the selection was incredible. Good plate of chips in there too. Atmosphere is really pleasant and of an evening, it's great to go outside and enjoy the fresh air with your beer.< /Text>

<text>Food good, but waitress KEPT BUMPING INTO OUR TABLE. Heavyset waitress, constantly grazing against our shoulder, walking to and from station. We're a large group, and once, twice I. But it happened every 3 minutes during a 1.5 hour family dinner during 2019 NBA All Star Game.  Her waitress pouch also stuck bout to the side adding additional bumps. She's unaware, and we started feeling uncomfortable. The general ambience there is great, in the same lit as Apple HQ. No other waiter it busser bumped into us. Blonde, wide framed lady should get notified to be aware of surroundings. It's about guests, not you.</text>< Gmap_id>

Great place to eat, but the service was horrible.  The waiter didn't show up until I had asked twice and 15 mins had passed.  Once he did show up, it took another 5-10 mins to get my drink.  I sat at a table close to the bar which wasn't very busy.   Outcome - Food is good, service isn't.</review>

<review>The food was excellent and the service was good too.  I have a cilantro allergy and they were excellent about it.  Parking, on the other hand, is a nightmare.  The up side to this is that the wait to be seated is minimal because they literally can not handle having more people because those people would have nowhere to put their cars.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

BJs is a good chain at least the ones I've been to, so maybe it was a bad night. I will start on a positive note. The food was good. I had the Mediterranean chicken tacos. One of the bartenders was good, while the other two were more interested in talking to each other. The manager looked like he was going to pass out, just walking around. Not a good image. Plus he walked by my finished plate, looked at it and walked by. He didn't seem to want to help his staff.

Again, every other BJs has been good to great. I'm hoping this one was just having a rough night.</text>

<Review>This place is awesome! Ribs are definitely a must have either full or half rack. Service is slow both the wait for a table and your order. While I was there a family was neglected completely. Make sure you save room for dessert because the Pizookie is the only way to end your meal. I suggest the trio sampler so you can taste three options!<//Review>< Response>

This place use to be good but the quality of service has declined over the last few years due to high turnover. The last few times I came, the waiter or waitress had just started and was fumbling around while the food was of sub par quality. Also don't order take out from delivery service because it will always be an hour late regardless of who you order through.</Text>

Then tried to convince us that the wrong pizookie was actually correct and that the macadamia nut looks just like the salted caramel. The cook straight up lied go us. Our waiter said, that the cook was wrong and we were right. The managers stepped in to help, but when the messed up the second time, he didn't even show his face again.</text>< Pics>

Nice place, not really that crowded the times I have been, it's really dimly lit, makes it hard to read their booklet of a menu.  Service was good though. Parking is good too.< /Text>

< Review>
The only redeeming quality of my visit to this establishment was the company I was with (a very cute guy). Otherwise, it took an hour to get all our food, and an hour to get completely cashed out. I was very not happy with the quality of the waitstaff or the manager.</Review>

BJ's has a decent beer selection and an extensive menu. Wasn't really impressed with the service though, especially since it was late at night and not too many people there. Overall, nothing that special, but a good late night spot.</review>

<Text>Large, nice, accommodating BJ's. This is one of the bigger ones I have seen. The menu is huge and can be intimidating, but my wife and I usually share a medium BBQ Chicken pizza (some to take home).

Pros:
- large, many TVs
- covered out door area
- THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE LARGE GROUPS.
Cons:
- pretty busy with wait times (only nice late-night restaurant in the area).
- Many kids from the area come here.
- Since it is big, it can get loud...

Tip: because we had a baby, we called ahead to get our name on the list in advance. Apparently they don't usually do that.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>This place blows. Not as good as it used to be. Pizza oven was not hot enough to completely melt the cheese. Toppings look like they came from a domino's pizza. I prefer Chicago deep dish pizza at other places. On the positive side, the restaurant is large and has several TVs for watching sports. This used to be a 3-3.5 star restaurant.< /review>< Resp>

Spinach stuffed mushrooms were good, while blonde asparagus was way more breading than asparagus.  Also, don't get their deep dish pizza, because it's not even like a real Chicago-style crusty deep dish (go to Blue Line Pizza in Campbell for a real thing!), but rather just a regular pizza that has extra dough (terrible!).  And service is slow.< /review><user_id>104192795471635794940</user_id>< Pics>

<text>The bathroom reminded me of a roadtrip. The whole floor was covered in urine, paper towels and toilet paper. If you need to pee, drive to a truck stop that has not been cleaned in a week, it would be better than bjs.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
We got there in time to catch the end of Argentina Chile. We sat next to the bar for the TV's. The bread is great. Steak I got was not bad. I prefer more well done though, close to burnt. For dessert I got the chocolate thunder from down under. Messi missed the penalty and the place went crazy. Fun time.</Review>

Indeed, it's always really crowded. You can't get a table of you go on a Friday or Saturday night.
Is it worth waiting an hour for? No.
The food is like any other chain restaurant. It can be pretty salty, bland, and just...generic. I've never gotten a meal here that especially surprises or impresses me.
Service can be really touch and go.  We've had some good service, but when we get poor service--it's REALLY POOR. We've had to wait looooong stretches of time for refills...we've had servers just not remember that we needed another beer....
I'm just not convinced this place is worth much.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fb5b6a473be33:0x48df16195b22c277<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I like this place simply because they're open until midnight!

You also get happy hour prices for beer, cocktails and food starting at 10 pm. The sausage flatbread pizza is pretty decent, especially with a nice cold glass of Blue Moon beer.

If you're craving for something sweet, then definitely get the pizookie (which brings back fond memories of college for me).</text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The food here was delicious, the wait was pretty reasonable for a Tuesday night, but the service had room for improvement.  I was never really sure who our waitress was and I don't think she really knew which table we were... needless to say it was slow to do anything that she was involved in like, approximately, everything.</review>

Went there at 9:15 pm (non peak hours ) and was seated immediately.  But after waiting more than 35 minutes, no one came to take our order. Finally when our server Mark A showed up he wasn't apologetic at all for the wait.  We just ordered one appetizer and one entree which took forever to arrive.
After a very long wait finally Mark brought us the food , but after that did not bother coming back at all to ask us if we needed anything or to ask if everything was ok.  We needed crushed pepper but finally had to start our meal before it got totally cold.  Will never go to this place again.
WORST SERVICE EVER !!!! They need to train their staff properly.</Text>

I just called the restaurant, telling them that my son is invited to a birthday party at the restaurant and explaining that he is on a strict diet and can't eat anything outside, but as a mom i want him to be with his friends and be part of the birthday party, so i asked them if i can bring him food from home and just serve his food like all the other kids in the restaurant plate, so he feels like a regular kid, they said i can bring a sealed container but they can't serve in with there dishes, isn't that crazy ? what are they afraid of ? don't they wash the dishes after they serve ? why on earth can't they make a child that has special minimize his problems and let him feel good ??? think out of the box people, have some compassion, so angry and disappointed with this place< /Review>

Food is very consistent and price is good.  The service is hit or miss due to the high turnover of staff.  Overall it is a family favorite.<//text>

I like this place simply because they're open until midnight!

You also get happy hour prices for beer, cocktails and food starting at 10 pm. The sausage flatbread pizza is pretty decent, especially with a nice cold glass of Blue Moon beer.

If you're craving for something sweet, then definitely get the pizookie (which brings back fond memories of college for me).< /review>

Always great service at the Cupertino restaurant. I realize it's a chain and all, but their food is not crappy quality like a lot of chains. And, they always bring it out right away super hot. Great management there seems to keep everyone on it and no b.s.  Great food and great service. Great ambience.  I am a fan.... oh and the pizookie. What more do you need?  :)</text>

<review>Beers are good and service is great as well.
But food isn't. Too greasy too fatty. Best item in the many is salad with bell pepper and blackened salmon.</review>< Pictures>

If you are an indian person, they will seat you at the right back corner of the restaurant. This happened to me twice and second time I observed that all the indian (looking) patrons were seated in the same corner of the restaurant! It was a weird and uneasy feeling of a racial profiling.</Text>

This is one of my favorites in Cupertino.
People are always very friendly, service is fast, and food is very good.
Be sure to taste their blackened salmon and their blonde beer.<//Text>

Worst part is that we were waiting for more than 40 mins after ordering and no one showed up. When we complained about this to floor manager, waiter showed up and he wasn't apologetic but bit rude.

<Review>EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!!!!! Me and my boyfriend just wanted to order a couple of late night Pizookies but ended up sitting at the table for 30 almost 40 mins while we watched other tables get theirs. When we asked the waiter where our Pizookies were, he said he would go check but ever end up showing to check.... we asked to speak with the manager and again... DID NOT DO ANYTHING BUT APOLOGIZE FOR THE SERVICE. Rest assured, never will me, my family or my boyfriend step foot in such an establishment of poor quality service. There are way better places to dine than this place. Save your money for somewhere else. Eatting out is an experience. Terrible service can make good food taste bad.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
This used to be an all-star brewhouse for me , for the past decade or so. Food is great , and so are the beverages. Their in-house blends are really good - blonde (beer) being my favorite. Expect wait times , place reservation upfront. Parking can be bit tricky over weekends. Park only in designated spots and inside restaurant parking zone strictly. The warmth of reception and serving is somewhere gone , with hi-tech gadgets to wow you otherwise. Servers don't have time to chat up anymore as they are overwhelmed :( . Good for parties and large groups as well. Conveniently reachable via 280 / 85 / 101 from most places in the santa clara valley.< /Review>

Usually just get cocktails and appetizers, but I also like the cobb salad. Very popular so there's a long wait sometimes (especially game nights).< /text>

Working staff doesn't have courtesy, I went to Bj's and unfortunately I left my wallet...we went outside and as soon as I realize I left my wallet within 5 minute I came back, my wallet was gone :( I started asking manager seem like he/she doesn't care abt someone's belongings. Never even responded me, I called them after reaching home same rude answer.<//text>

Worst take out service... no utensiles. No bbq sauce when you order ribs, no dipping sauce for appetizers. Forgot things in my take out order. If you order to-go always double ck your bag. They are known for being bad. I eat here because it's open late but always end up going to safeway to buy some thing they forgot</Review>

<Review>SEARED AHI TUNA SALAD!
That's all you need to know if you're trying to figure out what to order. Sooooooooooo good and filling!! I loveeeeeeeeee it... even more than the pizookie.

If you're coming in at a busy hour, then make sure you make reservations. The wait can take foreverrrrr, and there isn't much to do around this restaurant other than stare at Apple Headquarters (Infinite Loop) and Outback Steakhouse (across the street). If there is a long wait, but you're with a party of 4 or less (maybe 6 or less), then I suggest you check out the tables at / nearby the bar. Those tables are first come first serve, so spot a table that is wrapping up and run for that table before someone else gets it. Flash your Apple badge and get a discount!

Other things I like here:
- Cookies n cream pizookie (Red velvet pizookie is too sweet for me)
- Mozzarella cheese sticks
- A Drink Like That
- Wine Down Tuesdays: half off bottles of wine<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

servers are slow or just not into it.  Forgot our utensils had to get another server give us some. Parking is a nightmare many cars illegally parked horror getting back to the street and the valets service sucks. was told valet service is free but we accept gratuity (who is told they need to tip). Food was okay but forgettable compared to the many issues this restaurant has!< /text>

Enjoyed the food here, well made burgers and ribs. The sparkling sangria was also fantastic. However, some of the beers I have enjoyed in the past at BJs such as the stout and porter tasted watered down when I tried them at this location.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A restaurant in front of Apple's former headquarters. It's like a sports bar, but the food is delicious, so I often stop by. Since there is a lot of volume, Japanese people will end up leaving a lot if they do not order by sharing.

Pizza is fluffy and recommended, but please be aware that pasta is American and squishy.

(Original)
Apple旧本社前にあるレストラン。スポーツバー風ですが、結構料理も美味しいので、よく立ち寄ります。ボリュームが多いので、日本人はシェアでオーダーしないとたくさん残す羽目になります。

ピザがフワフワでオススメですが、パスタはアメリカンでぐにゃぐにゃなのでお気をつけください。</review><gmap_id>0x808fb5b6a473be33:0x48df16195b22c277<//gmap_id><username>Hossy at Trinity, Inc. (Hossy at Trinity, Inc.)<//username><Rate>4<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>(Translated by Google) As the name of Brewhouse suggests, more than 50 kinds of beer were on the menu. In addition, the recommended beers are lined up from light to bitter, so you can choose the one with a taste that makes you feel lost.
The meals were meat-based and snack-based, and there weren't many seafood-based meals.
It was just right because I was looking for a vacant shop late in the day, but it was quite crowded just before the last order.
Basically, it is a place that can only be reached by car, but there were also non-alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic beer.

(Original)
Brewhouseの名前の通り、50種類以上のビールがメニューに載っていました。また、おすすめのビールでライトなものからビターな物へと並べてあるので、迷わすのみたいテイストの物を選ぶことが出来ます。
食事は肉系とおつまみ系で、シーフード系はあまりありませんでした。
遅い時間に空いているお店を探していたのでちょうど良かったですが、ラストオーダー間際でも結構混んでいました。
基本的には車でないと行かれない場所ですが、ノンアルコールドリンク、ノンアルコールビールもありました。< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqZf5I4Z_VyJmkiZViQ9SAVr-Mb8od4uf282zU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdx2wIlhRl31BuW7pX3XRGpVM5ie6cfLEp1WTk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6GvMaNy-PBgOe34886SzSk2WyPYvomEN8aqA9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNi60iQdV_mbEEzcodbFzm4uW03SjZ8kuhGDyt7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRkxo9_hDOTxuJ5O5LkQeGtK-Q9Fo4qBVN9f45=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the price is similar to that of Taiwanese gourmet restaurants, but the portion is much larger. The meal time is about to wait more than 30 minutes, and then the parking space next to it will be full.

(Translated by Google) A large place, there are many people and the waiters can sew up, BUT:
- A large menu with completely different and interesting dishes - from salad to steak;
- if there is no table right now, they take a number and send an SMS when the table is ready;
- A large selection of beer, wine, spirits;
- there is an application in which they give dessert as a gift;)

A cool restaurant to pass the evening or two!

(Original)
Большое место, бывает много народу и официанты могут зашиваться, НО:
- большое меню с совершенно разными и интересными блюдами - от салата до стейка;
- если столика нет прямо сейчас, они берут номер и присылают смс, когда столик готов;
- большой выбор пива, вина, крепкого алкоголя;
- есть приложение, в котором дают десерт в подарок ;)

Классный ресторан для того чтобы скоротать вечерок-другой!< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A large number of beers to choose from, and the dark varieties are very bitter, and the light ones are very soft. But for some reason in the morning I had a headache, although I drank only one mug. Most likely this is due to the fact that I then polished the result with Jack Daniels.

(Original)
Большое кол-во пива на выбор, причем темные сорта прям очень горькие, а светлые очень мягкие. Но почему-то на утро разболелась голова, хотя я выпил всего одну кружку. Скорее всего это из-за того что я потом отшлифовал результат Джеком Дэниэлсом.<//Text><username>Alibi Yeszhanov</username>< time>

(Translated by Google) If you deliver food and you have to pick up an order from this place, a good Czech tip is your order drinks and food because today in this place they did not deliver drinks and I had to return again and when I did they gave me one that was not and almost I had to make 3 trips

And he has very handsome waiters haha ​​😊😋
What I do not like is the limited parking, it is very difficult to find a free place and the long waiting list, with no place to sit 😕
