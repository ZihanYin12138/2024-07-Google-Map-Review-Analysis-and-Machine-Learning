Sarah is a master with color!  I trust her judgement completely and have never been disappointed. The salon is clean and safe. All the proper COVID-19 protocols are carefully followed. I buy all my Aveda hair and body products here too. I highly recommend Therapy Salon.< /Text>

This is my first visit with Sarah. She is so friendly and professional. Best of all, she totally understands my hair styling issue (flat on the crown and straight lifeless hair style) without me explaining much. Instead she explained to me how she could give me volume on the crown and movement to my hair. And she did a terrific job cutting and styling my hair. She even taught me how to do a cute bun on my hair. Finally, I saw from her website that there is a $20 discount for first timers and asked her casually about it at checkout. She said due to Covid , she is not doing vouchers currently, but she could still  extend it to me. Which to me is a very pleasant gesture as I understand how tough it is for them already in this Covid situation.
Totally enjoyed her service and would be going back for highlights soon!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I'm so happy to have found Therapy Salon. Sarah is an experienced stylist whom I've come to trust completely. A critical factor for me is Therapy's use of natural Aveda hair dye - I prefer to stay away from harsh chemicals. From the very beginning, Sarah understood my hair texture, color, and personal style. Over the years, Sarah has chopped my long hair into a bob, trimmed my new shoulder-length style, and perfected my highlights. I definitely recommend!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

My experience at therapy salon is the best I've ever had. Sara is extremely knowledgeable and listens to what her clients want. She goes above and beyond to provide an exceptional service. It was my first time getting my hair colored and was a bit nervous about the process. But when I met Sara I totally felt that I was in good hands. She did an excellent job on my hair. And not only that, but she also gave me perfect tips on how to protect my hair. And because of her tips, my hair is in excellent condition today. Thank you so much Sara!!

She is a wonderful, thoughtful, and caring person. I always feel lucky when I enter her salon. She does beautiful work for everyone, and I love to see my hair when she finishes each time!

I met her several years ago when my daughter told her that I had cancer.  Sarah immediately invited me to her salon.  I had very little hair, and I first saw Sarah's wonderful smile that brought me joy. She did a GREAT job, and I went home with a beautiful hair cover and everyone told me that I had beautiful hair!

Sarah supports children and adults who have cancer. During my appointment today, a darling girl came in with her mother.   Sarah brought the sweet little girl a darling hair cover and she loved it!  It was fun to see how happy the little girl was!

Sarah is amazing! I recommend that you go to Sarah's Salon.</Text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1581442552829, 'text': 'Wow! Thank you Nancy I’m so blown away by your review. It made my day sarah 😍😍😍'}</Response>< gmapID>

Excellent cuts, color, and Aveda products in a super clean, bright, and calming space. I always see Rosy--she keeps me looking modern and feeling poised. This salon is well-managed--I always get text appointment reminders and I've never had a mixup here. They have a good selection of Aveda products for sale. Easy parking and great location in the Rancho shopping center just off Foothill Expressway. They are near the center of the mall in the walkway by Gymboree.<//text>

If I could give this salon 10 stars, I would! Therapy offers a wide variety of services, using high quality products, at very reasonable prices. The owner, Sarah, does my hair and she specializes in high quality hair color and cutting techniques. She is honest, is impeccable with a scissor and color, and can help you figure out the right style for your face shape! The salon carries all Aveda products and this also includes makeup and body lotions as well as facial cleaners and candles. I can spend all day in this salon it feels like a day spa. I am beyond in love with this salon and I am always recommending it to my friends and colleagues. I promise you that you will not regret giving it a try. I can assure you that once you try it you will have found your new forever salon. Sarah, the salon owner, is sweet, honest, caring, and fun to talk to during my hair appointments, and most importantly she is very giving. The salon does many fundraisers that benefit cancer patients, for example Wigs for Kids fundraising.<//review>

Unfortunately their online system let me schedule an appointment for a time when the salon wasn't open, so I made the trek out to Los Altos for nothing. I probably should have double checked the open hours listed on the website, but I didn't think it would be a problem.< /Review>

Total Hidden Gem.  This place is really a "hidden gem", and under rated. The owner, Rezi, is a European trained stylist, and all the people working for her are experts in what they do.  It is a bit of a drive for me, but totally worth it.  Then I heard one of the customers saying that  they flew over from Colorado!  Cheers, E< /review>

Los Altos' finest hair care place. The new owner, Sarah, has the right touch with experience of over 30 years. Sarah will not let go of your hair until it's perfect. Sarah is never in a rush, but rather takes her time and makes you feel very special, as it should be when it involves your hair! Therapy Salon sign is visible at the Rancho Shopping Center, but the Salon itself is tugged in the back of the WildBerry Yogurt Shop. If you are looking for a fine hair salon, stop by "Therapy Salon" to experience the services for yourself. Prices are reasonable for a high end, Aveda certified Salon!< /review>

Until I met Sarah, my hair was damaged and allergic to color. Sarah patiently changed all that and created an update hair style I love.</text>

Popped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Guy leaving sent compliments to the chef which was a good sign. Nice full plates of food. Food and service was great for a small town cafe. Lunch specials are plates and was told dinner was family style.< /review>

Ate here on Christmas. Everything you want in a solid americanized chinese restaurant. Solid portions, not overly greasy but still indulgent, fair prices, friendly staff, they have all the favs on the menu and lots of vegetarian options.< /Review>

The first time I ordered food from this place it was really expensive and that was just for orange chicken the person on the phone made me order two whole dinners of orange chicken when I just wanted two orders of orange chicken which made me very unhappy but I went along with it cuz I was not in the mood to cook dinner that night

Then I went back another time and the prices were even higher I don't understand how you can raise prices during a pandemic and expect to have repeat customers and the second time the food was not as good as the first time granted they were following procedures that the health department put in place for coronavirus but don't try to take advantage of the customer during a pandemic

The female staff member was very polite and courteous no complaints there</Review>

We bought $60 in food, threw away $57 worth of food. Plus didn't come with rice! My roommate and I hate this place! He says it was good until "new" owners (a few years ago) and remodel. Only reason we eat there is we forget how bad it is. Plus they do not deliver. This is one place that needs to go out of business. Sad.< /Text>

Small plates? All servings I have ordered have been more than could be eaten in one sitting. The food is good, satisfying and the waitress remembers everything including an icy cold Tsing Tao. Service is attentive and courteous and I always leave with enough for another meal.<//Text>

Consistently great food and great service. They are very accommodating and always friendly.  The produce is always really fresh and the meat is always high quality. The food is hot and the drinks are cold.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Our second time in and everything was delicious. Good service, friendly staff and entree reccomendations were spot on. NO MSG, fact! I had no msg migraine/  hangover either time we've eaten here. House made sauces, including the sweet and sour sauce that was perfectly balanced. Fresh vibrant vegetables. Thrilled to finally find delicious Chinese food. The only negative we experienced was the soft drinks do not have free refills. The prices here are on par with or less expensive than other Chinese food restaurants we've tried in the neighboring communities that had terrible food so I'm very happy with the prices here.< /Review>

Has a different (but not bad) taste after it went under new ownership, but the food and service is still excellent! There's a special place in my heart for Hong Kong Chinese, as I've been eating here with my mom since I was 5. Try the orange chicken, it's super addictive!</Review>

<review>Rice is an add on. So if you order something to go make sure to ask for rice if you want it. And pay extra. How crazy is that? Lots of potential but inconsistent the many times I've been in since they reopened. All three of our visits were slow. One night I called in an order. Gave them an extra 10 minutes before coming in. Then waited 50 minutes. Total time from order to food! 1 hour and 25 minutes. They had three tables the entire time I was waiting and four other people waiting with me. Four people were working and three were in the kitchen. It was insane. They lied to people who came in and kept saying "oh sorry, almost ready!"
I always double check the bill because the prices are very high for the small amount you get.
Unfortunately half of the stuff we've ordered wasn't that great. The eggplant & garlic stir fry was inedible from the huge amount of MSG they laid on it. I'm actually cool with MSG on occasion and cook with it. But this was crazy. I should've gone back and demanded a refund but by the time I got home i had already wasted a chunk of my night so I just ate my girlfriends leftovers. This place is unfortunately our best option for Chinese food Osos< /review><UserId.>113223716098238240796< /UserId.>< name>

Good food. A staple in Los Osos since forever. Newly remodeled, prices on the menu show that too. Best Chinese food restaurant in town.</Text>

Good food.  A little pricey</text>

The food at Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant has always been very fresh and hot.  The visual appeal tells me how fresh everything is.  The taste of freshness and wonderful flavors backs up the visual appeal.  The Hot and Sour Soup is rich and full of fresh Shiitake mushrooms.  The Pot Stickers are to die for in my book - full of savory meat, not doughy at all, but golden brown with a crispness along with the juiciness of each bite.  The Won Ton Soup is so simply wonderful, that I must have it when I occasionally don't feel great - that chicken broth heals.  The Kung Pao Chicken  is crunchy, wonderfully flavorful, and of course, fresh!   Can't wait to try other dishes....</Text>

Great service and good food. Portion size is more than generous. Can be busy at times but worth the wait. We have also had take out from here and quality was the same.</text>

<text>My tip is....... go ahead and give the Shrimp Lo Mein a shot. You wont be sorry, it was really good! I swear I could taste the "breath of the dragon" just a slight smokiness from the heat of the wok and a good sized portion.  The fried rice was a disappontment though, as the only thing that sepatated it from steamed rice was that it was brown. I did see a small trace.....a really small trace of egg but that was it, there were no peas it was only brown. Tip 2, go with the steamed rice and avoid any dissapointment over the rice because the Shrimp Lo Mein is good!<//text>< Pics>

Amazing power hot yoga class. I was in town from San Francisco and needed to relax and this studio was perfection. The instructor was one of the best I have ever taken with.</text>

<Name>Teresa Bui<//Name><Time>1576994089210</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I love hot yoga, - it helps strengthen the body,  cleanse the pores but also provides a place of self reflection and focus in a world full of distraction.

The teachers at Zuda have been great, they push you to your best, but they also don't judge you when you are struggling. The studio itself
is gorgeous : simple yet modern, airy and white with a nice wood flooring.  There's 2 bathrooms, water refill station, dressing rooms and showers. There's 2 hour free parking nearby.

You sign up for classes online and reserve your mat space and they put a block and mat for you already. Some classes are more packed than others, the one with Anne Marie (the studio owner) teaching is always packed so come a few minutes early. I love it when they have live music inside the studio.

The only thing is that they don't always explain how to do a pose. There's lots that you can look to your neighbors for guidance but some others poses such as crow or handstand, you either have to learn on your own, or ask after class.

They have $30 for 30 days for new students, so check it out!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I am so glad I decided to start going to Zuda!  Yoga has always been something that I have wanted to get serious about, even tried joining a studio in a couple different cities. I can honestly say that Zuda is hands down the best yoga experience I have ever had.  All of the instructors are so passionate, and everyone participating in the class makes you feel welcome right from the start!  I genuinely look forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays solely for Zuda!</text>

My first time going to yoga and I’m so glad it was Zuda Yoga! Zuda challenges me physically and mentally. I leave class super sweaty but relaxed. The team here is incredibly sweet and knowledgeable. I also love the instructors and the words of wisdom at the end of class.</review>

I've been practicing yoga for many years now, but just recently started going to Zuda. It has been an amazing experience and has deepened by yoga practice. The studio is beautiful and the front desk staff is so welcoming. The mat reservation system is easy to use and allows me to practice in the area of the room I like best. The classes are fun and challenging. The teachers are positive and friendly. It's a beautiful place to practice for everyone, from beginners to experienced yogis.<//Text>

Zuda was my first time ever doing hot yoga! Their intro deal is $30 for 30 days. It's a great way to try the different instructors and different class levels and styles. I'm not personally too familiar with the practice of yoga, but had done it before and was familiar with the different poses. When in doubt I just take a look around at others! I'm a big fan of Lindsey and Kenny. I have noticed a difference in the class levels, in that level 1 classes the instructors will explain a bit more. Overall I think even beginners would be fine and able to go at their own pace and take what they need in more advanced classes. Some of the weekday evening classes can get really packed and they have a new system where you reserve a specific spot in the room on the app. The front staff is great and very welcoming. The studio is very clean and well kept. I highly recommend trying Zuda out! Definitely hydrate all day and during and take breaks when you need.< /text>

I live in San Francisco and am in Sacramento visiting family often. My husband and I make a point to fit in some Zuda action whenever we get the chance. They make everyone feel super welcome, the classes are tough but always fun (and with great music) and the space is really nice and well maintained. Definitely the best in Sac and honestly better than anything in SF too.</text>

Zuda is the first studio yoga that I have done.  Zuda was recommended by a few coworkers of mine.  I usually only do one or two classes a week, but it is a really good compliment to my other workouts.  I really like how easy it is to sign up for classes, everyone is really welcoming, and the workouts are great.<//Text>

<Review>I absolutely love Zuda. The yoga space doesn’t have a mirror but instead lots and lots of windows for natural light. The teachers guide the class wonderfully always leaving room for you to do what feels best for your body. The attitude of self-care over “excercise” is really truly what I love about yoga, and Zuda encourages that beautifully. You will sweat, you will get a work out, but it’s more than that.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

I am loving my experience with Zuda so far! The space is beautiful and the staff/instructors are incredibly welcoming and open. I am relatively new to yoga, and I love the encouragement to explore the capabilities of my body and mind, at a pace that works for me. If you’re looking for a new space, I highly recommended this one and you can’t beat the intro special!<//Review>

I still consider myself a beginner and the all level classes are at my level and have components that challenge me to take it to the next. The heat component is really nice. It’s not too intense and helps me deepen my poses.<//Text>< Rating>

Zuda yoga is great if you like really hot yoga and you know sun A and B sequences. However, if you are new to yoga, you will sometimes be left to “flow” through an unfamiliar sequence of postures without much guidance. Zuda yoga is also the first studio I’ve ever been to with “assigned” spots. Mind you, this studio has maxed out the spots available in the room leaving you uncomfortably close to another human.</Review>

Every time I have been to Zuda, I am greeted with warmth and joy.  I have friends who go, but even when they are not present, I feel loved by the people around me.  Some instructors ask that students introduce themselves to one another and give each other a hug.  It might be uncomfortable for some, but deep down, people feel very connected and loved.  The actual yoga is a challenge too! Be prepared to sweat!</text>

All the instructors are great. I always leave class feeling energized, happy, and motivated. The studio is beautiful and clean with lots of amenities (bathrooms, filtered water station, shop with snacks and yoga clothing). One of the best yoga studios in town!< /text>

Zuda is the best yoga studio I've ever been to. I'm a runner, and have had a hard time with yoga because I don't feel like the workout is rigorous enough, BUT this is NOT the case at Zuda. I feel so strong doing their practice because it is a workout! The mental benefits are tremendous, it promotes meditation and visualization. I am so happy to have found this place!! Whenever I am in need of a mental pick-me-up I feel confident that a yoga class at zuda will realign my mind and body. They play cool music and the instructors are all super positive and welcoming people. Hands down, the best yoga studio in Sac!!!</review>

This is a distinctive yoga studio set apart from the rest on account of its palpable sense of community, and commitment to a shared experience. The teachers are friendly and approachable, and they make it a point to welcome all levels. The studio gets hot -- you will sweat -- but you will also leave feeling more grounded, and in a very real sense, cared for.<//Review>

< Review>
I started going to Zuda at the invitation of a close friend. I've only attended weekend morning classes so far but definitely thinking of signing up for a membership and branching out to more days. I'm excited to bring my daughter for a Sunday kids class, when we can both get our workout in, at the same time and under the same roof. I have enjoyed the full-class feeling and energy of the studio. It is well lit and smells clean, despite all of sweat that pours off of me each class. I enjoy the variety of music, some modern but appropriately chosen for the mood, and some more spiritual or tribal sounding - both types lend well to the energy of each set of exercises during the class. The teachers I've sampled have been consistent in teaching flavor and feel like good guides as I drop in to my body in each session. The all-levels class has a good mix of challenging add-on moves that can take any pose to the next level. Teachers encourage students to only do what they feel is right for their body that day, so I have not felt pressured to exceed my capabilities just to keep up with the class. Well done Zuda!</Review>

Just started really going to Zuda Yoga and am really enjoying it.  The teachers push you but remind you to take it at your own speed and really make you feel part of their community.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there aren't showers or locker rooms so its not an option to hit a yoga class on your way to work.<//review>

It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an experienced yoga goer. The instruction at Zuda makes you feel like you've done this for years or that you could get to that point with a bit of patience and determination. Everyone at Zuda is incredibly inviting and created a place of peace for me to re-center myself. Zuda has made my 2019 one of the most active years of my life.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>A truly uplifting experience. I have taken classes with 6 instructors so far and they are all knowledgeable. The instructors have a parallel way of leading the class by emphasizing the breath but teach you different yoga poses. My favorite part of the classes is how the poses flow from one to the next and the steps repeat. Would recommend to beginners or advanced yogis since I am still a beginner and my friend has been a member for more than a year and we both get an equally positive experience.</review>< time>

I really like Zuda yoga for many reasons- they heat up the room during practice to just the right temp, hot enough to get a great sweat, but not so much you're feeling suffocated. The main studio has awesome floors, sweet audio system, and they keep it clean. The teachers have an upbeat and positive vibe and the flow sequences are well-thought out usually. Plus you always leave feeling like you got a great workout (plus I sleep better!) The assistants give exquisite adjustments!

I recently moved from Washington DC, and the one thing I miss about my old studio is the dab of essential oil the teacher would give each student before class; it wasn't about the oil but about the teacher making a quick connection to each student. I also miss the teacher cuing to turn and say hello to each neighbor to "break the ice" before class. This lack of connection between teachers/ students leaves me often feeling like the teachers at Zuda will never know who I am or my name, and it's hard to connect with other students around you. I realize I may need to assert myself more, but it doesn't seem the studio really cultivates those opportunities very well-- and I can compare that to my regular studio in DC that did a great job of that. Those would be my recommendations! Keep up the AMAZING work!< /text>

Classes at Zuda are the perfect balance between a stellar sweaty workout and a peaceful meditation. After only 5 classes, I feel my body transforming and my mental health improving.

I'm trying out the 30 day new student special and love incorporating hot yoga into my daily routine. There is a great variety of teachers and teaching styles and all classes I've gone to have been excellent. Yin yoga is also offered several days a week and provides a nice alternative to yang in an unheated room. Morning meditation at 5:30 (followed by 6am vinyasa) is a great way to start my day. Thanks for a great experience and looking forward to continuing!</review>

<Review>Zuda yoga is one of the best yoga studios in Sacramento. The teachers are well-prepared and clear, the staff are friendly and organized, and the atmosphere is relaxing. I also appreciate the wide class time slots available--I can pretty much can take a class anytime seven days a week.

Zuda yoga is an amazing total mind and body workout. The coordinated breathing combined with a multitude of poses provides concentrated strength training.  The stretching improves balance and coordination. You really feel the core engage and arms and legs as well.   The perspiration is a visible sign of the mind and body at work!</review>

I think initially I was really intimated to go in, but after the first practice I was hooked, after the 75 minute basics level 1 class I feel like I've just done a 10K. Everyone there is super nice and welcoming, I really like Michael's classes in the evening, super chill and exhausting all at once.< /text>

Zuda Yoga is a wonderful yoga studio. I haven’t been disappointed with any of the classes I have taken- be prepared to drip sweat! Ann Marie is also such an amazing instructor! Zuda also offers kids classes once a week!! I haven’t found a studio who does this and it makes it much easier for me to get a class in! :) I would highly recommend Zuda to any friends wanting to experience yoga<//text>

<text>This studio rocks!  It's teaches towards the perfect balance of power, poise, propioception, and perspiration!  Not just a physical pump, it will jump your day, so you don't jump the shark! Downsides are few, but the usic can get a bit loud sometimes and the heat can be a little annoying if one doesn't handle it well, but there's plenty of towels on hand to handle the splash.< /text>< pics>

My experience at Zuda has been nothing but inviting and encouraging. I have knee problems that limit my ability to do certain poses. Prior to a class I asked the instructor about modifications which led to many options for me. Additionally, my instructor took the initiative to include those modifications within the practice. This made me feel welcome and heard. Thank you Zuda!<//review>

<review>​Zuda is my first yoga studio for trying Hot Yoga and I can confidently say the experience so far has been phenomenal.  The studio is pretty large and very clean but it gets crowded and somehow they will always squeeze you in! The frequency of positive energy is very high during the yoga sessions and its probably because the studio gets crowded!  The instructors are very friendly and kind.  Highly recommend!<//review>< user_name>

I am someone who used to struggle with yoga — I found it difficult and couldn’t understand why others enjoyed it. But after a running injury I decided to open myself to trying again and I’ve grown to truly enjoy it. Zuda has been a big part of that! The basics class in particular is great. The teachers do an excellent job explaining the poses and coaching you through the mental difficulties. And they play fun music!</Review>

It's quite hot in the room so be prepared - but they provide free hand towels! There is some music. It's not easy (even level 1!) but its completely fine to take breaks anytime if it’s too hard. They also often have hands on assist (if you want it) which I really love. The teachers are all great and well trained.

I’ve been going off and on (mainly off) for the last 4 or so years but every time I come back to this studio it’s like the first time. Really, this place is special. The whole vibe from the moment you walk through the door, the decor inside is amazing, the floors are amazing, the temperature at which the room is kept is perfect, every teacher I’ve ever had is great. They all push me in different ways but only as much as I allow. The teacher/assistant is always there to help me get deeper into the pose when I need it. Going to Zuda is always a pleasant experience. I am so lucky to have this studio in my community.

I've had an absolutely wonderful experience at Zuda thus far. The staff is very welcoming, the facility clean, and there is a great sense of community at Zuda. They offer different classes with all amazing instructors, in which all skill levels are encouraged to push themselves but balance the need for pace. I’ve really learned to become aware and listen to my body throughout this practice.. I am excited to keep coming back!< /Text>

I started going to Zuda in January 2019. This was my first experience attending any yoga class and I wasn’t sure what to expect.  Recently completed my fifteenth class and each practice has been a unique experience and a GREAT workout. The staff is very welcoming as well as everyone I’ve encountered at Zuda.</review>

<review>I always come out of a Zuda yoga class completely refreshed, detoxified, and stress free. They provide you with numbered spaces so classes aren’t overpacked and a free hand towel ( which is amazing because I always seem to forget mine in the car, that pre yoga brain fog is real). No matter the skill level or teacher, I guarantee you will have an amazing experience. The only qualm I have is spending so much money per class, however, the benefits you receive are far worth your money spent in my personal opinion and they will reward you once you accumulate more classes. I dare you to try a class and fall in love with this crazy awesome community of people, you will not be disappointed.< /review><date>1571414202462< /date><Pics>None< /Pics>< Gmap_id>

I have been to many yoga studios in the past and nothing has been like the Zuda yoga experience! It’s meditative and it’s a great workout. I also thought the heat would be too much but I actually love it. No more foot cramps and I think it’s because of the heat!! If you are thinking trying Power Vinyasa then Zuda should be your first/only stop!<//Review>

Great studio, great instructors! Was new to hot /yoga and was nervous at first of what it would entail but Zuda has been an great studio to learn the practice in. Always challenges me while also helping me feel more relax at the end of a long day. Highly recommend trying it!< /text>

I’ve always wanted to get into Yoga and Zuda was a PERFECT place to start. Vinyasa style seems to always differentiate depending on the teacher which keeps in interesting  rather than doing the same boring routine. I did the 30 days for $30 new student package but if you complete more than 12  classes within that 30 days you get 50% off your next month! You can’t really beat this place.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Zuda was the first hot yoga studio that I tried—the 30 days for $30 is a great way to try the different studios around town. After my 30 days—I kept coming back to Zuda. Personally for me, there is the right mix of meditation and mind /spirituality—with a solid workout that works every part of your body and you leave feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. The teachers and the students are all very welcoming and helpful. Even if you can't make a 'level 1 class' you can do an 'all levels' class and take it at your own pace ( if you have done yoga or hot yoga before).

As far as pricing goes—I highly recommend doing the 10 class passes if you're not wanting to do a membership or not going to go consistently. I use the practice to supplement my running so the pass is a great way to sprinkle in some good cross training (mentally and physically) throughout my trainings.

The facility is clean and beautiful with easy accessible bathrooms.

<text>As a beginner in the practice of yoga, I have a lot of insecurities about my form and flexibility. I see others with perfect form and in poses that I can only imagine. I’ve tried several studios around Sacramento and I’ve never felt as welcome, or encouraged as I do at Zuda. The teachers and assistants are always so helpful and passionate about their practice. Arrive at least 10 minutes early if you’re with a friend because classes are full for good reason.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

Loved my trial membership with Zuda and will definitely be back for more! The heat, music, and instructors are exactly what I’ve been looking for.  Class options for early birds, night owls and everything in between.  If you’re looking to sweat and connect with some rad humans, I’d definitely recommend this studio.<//text>

Zuda Yoga is all around amazing. I've been attending classes for about 3 weeks now and each teacher is supportive, kind and interesting with their approach and guidance. Every class is different and unique.
Is it a challenge? Yes. Will you feel fantastic afterwards? A resounding yes!
Please do yourself a favor and attend.< /Review>

I also like how they've recently changed the scheduling so that as a session ends there is more of a gap of when the next class starts to help with the flow of traffic. I appreciate all I've seen and learned here so far. I cannot renew unfortunately because I already have a membership with The Boulder Field (also offers yoga) and cannot maintain both financially. I hope I can return for a one time visit here and there sometime after May 6.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1556680964760, 'text': 'We hope to have you back Rebecca whenever you can!!'}<//resp>< GmapID>

Being completely new to yoga in general, hot yoga was an intimidating thought. It wasn't until a friend gifted the $30 for 30 promotion to me that I finally decided to give it a try. It took me about 3 or 4 classes to get the hang of the flow sequences and poses. The staff is friendly and the instructors are always welcoming, regardless of what level you're at - I'm a huge fan of Jojo's classes! The studio is clean, modern and has a calming effect. After completing about 7 or 8 classes, I am already seeing a positive difference in myself physically and mentally. If you're a newbie to yoga like me and on the fence about it, I highly recommend you give it try!<//review>

As a beginner in the practice of yoga, I have a lot of insecurities about my form and flexibility. I see others with perfect form and in poses that I can only imagine. I’ve tried several studios around Sacramento and I’ve never felt as welcome, or encouraged as I do at Zuda. The teachers and assistants are always so helpful and passionate about their practice. Arrive at least 10 minutes early if you’re with a friend because classes are full for good reason.</review>

This studio is a great place to sweat it out with a relaxing and challenging work out! Highly recommend the power vinyasa all levels class with Jen-great music and great vibe! I had never taken a yoga class before attending Zuda, and had a wonderful first experience as the instructors are fun and willing to help any new comers learn the moves. 5 stars!</Review>

I am looking to make my practice more regular again and decided to try the 30:30 program and am very pleased! Everyone is very friendly, the space is beautiful and convenient, and there are plenty of classes throughout the day. The rooms are a bit warmer than I’m used to for vinyasa, but I am getting used to it more and more. I would definitely recommend this place!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Zuda Yoga kicks my butt and leaves me feeling relaxed and energized. It is not your traditional yoga flow. The 75 min classes incorporate mindful asanas and challenges your endurance.  From the moment you walk in the door to the leaving the studio you will be greeted by a sense of community, warmth, and love. If you have not gone, try their 30 day trial and see if it is right for you. Having practiced yoga for seven years now, I can confidently say I am hooked.<//Review>< gmapID>

Zuda is where I started my yoga journey and I've been in love ever since. I've learned so much about myself, the philosophy of yoga, and my body in general. The Zuda team has been so supportive in helping me grow from poses to understanding the importance of connecting our breath to our movements. Thanks for giving me a yoga fam (:< /review>

<review>Amazing Power Vinyasa classes at Zuda Midtown.  New to the studio after having practiced elsewhere for years, and after hearing others rave about Zuda, I've experienced several classes now in the past 2 weeks.  The instructors are all amazing and the classes are always packed.  Sunday morning yoga was the best yet.  The facility is clean, welcoming and the teachers are professional and good at what they do.  So glad I tried Zuda.< /review></record>

An awesome powerful fun studio for yogis~ everyone, both instructors and students are postive and friendly creating a team like atmosphere.  No one is there to pressure you to do certain pose or work harder.  However the class makes you want to try and try harder!  End result, each class you are left with feeling of accomplishment and stronger body/mind.< /Review>

Everyone's practice is a little different.  Some do yoga for the spiritual aspect, some for the amazing workout, some for the emotional healing and some for the sense of community.  Depending on the mood of the day, I go for all the above.  Zuda, is a very welcoming place.  Very respectful and joyous.  The staff is extremely polite and genuinely seem happy to see you.  Each practice is challenging and taught by very well trained staff and assistants.  Many places have great staff, however, I have yet to find a place that has better assistants then Zuda.  Go once and get down on child's pose during the middle of a session and you'll see what I mean.
I would highly recommended that anyone new to Yoga or the Sacramento region give Zuda a try.<//Review>

I have enkoyed the 30 for 30.

The hot yoga class does seem to be somewhat crouded. There were times when the person next to me was so close, they were on my mat. I also expereionced being so close to otherts that I was on their may as well.<//Review>

Zuda is always amazing. It’s the second Place I went to for Bikram Yoga, and now the only one I will go to. There are many different times to choose from, and I can always find one that fits my schedules. Everyone that works there is always very friendly and kind as soon as you walk through the door and I’ve honestly liked every instructor I’ve had there. Can’t recommend it enough! 🙏🏽<//Review>

<text>I've done yoga here and there before and it was alright.  After my first session at Zuda (now my 15th visit) I found REAL yoga.  I arrive welcomed and relaxed, 75 minutes at peace while smiling and entertained, and leave with deep thoughts from instructor Anne Marie that stay with me for days, weeks, months.  Sunday mornings have become a routine I never want to miss.  Thank you Zuda for entering my life and my family.</text>< resp>

<text>I finally found my calling! I have always been interested in yoga and I’ve taken yoga classes at 24 Hour Fitness and Cal Fit but those classes do not compare to the experience at Zuda. I went to my first class with a friend and the employees were extremely inviting and helpful. They made me feel right at home. Anne Marie Kramer (the owner) was the instructor the first time I went and her class was amazing. I truly felt centered after her class. The $30 for 30 days is an awesome deal! If you’re interested in yoga in a modern setting with the perfect ambiance, give Zuda a shot!< /text><username>Michelle Le</username></record></dataset><record>

I love Zuda! This studio is so cute and tidy. The staff are always warm and welcoming. I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone who is interested in hot yoga. I am a college athlete and have never sweat so much in my life!! I started off in the beginner classes until I felt comfortable in all levels. Instructors were very patient to answer any questions I had before or after class. If you’re unsure try their 30 for 30, it’s a great deal.< /text>

I've had an absolutely amazing experience at Zuda. I just finished my tenth class. Before I signed up I was a bit intimidated by the idea of hot yoga. I had only done yoga once before I started coming to Zuda. However, after my first lesson all of my worries were gone. They really encourage you to go at your own pace, whether you're a beginner or an advanced student. They have classes of varying levels, and many different wonderful instructors. Each practice is different from the last, so it never feels repetitive. I can't say enough positive things about this yoga studio, and they've made me excited to continue practicing yoga.</Text>

Love yoga? Then you will Love Zuda! I was a new comer to the practice and they make me want to keep coming back. All the staff are friendly and experts. If you have practiced Yoga in Sac, then your teacher most likely has come from Zuda’s teacher training program. Keep coming back to your mat!< /text>

I have LOVED my experience at Zuda Yoga.  I have tried several other studios in the area, and this one is far and away the best I have been to.  They have an awesome introductory deal ($30 for unlimited yoga in your first month) that some other studios offer as well, but this is the first studio I will continue with once my first month expires.  The instructors are positive, friendly, and extremely welcoming and seem to all have great playlists.  The studio offers lots of classes throughout the day and has a clean, bright, and friendly vibe.  The class sizes are quite large, which is sometimes an issue at other studios but at Zuda seems to just add to the group dynamic.  Make sure to bring your own yoga mat and towel (they are each $5 to rent, which is significantly more expensive than other places I’ve been), but they’ll allow you to borrow for free on your first class.  Also, there is only 1 shower, but people are quick and I never end up waiting long.  Overall it’s a great studio and I would recommend to anyone I know!</review>

And this is thanks to the challenge and fun in every class, the kindness/authenticity of all the teachers and staff, and the positive energy in the studio. It doesn’t matter who is teaching- every teacher guides beautifully. Sometimes, I say to myself- what am I going to do if I ever move out of Sacramento and I can’t practice at Zuda anymore? I’m not lying. I will be sad.
You guys rock! And I love you very much, Zuda!

Sweaty and vigorous yoga! Classes are big so don't expect too much personal attention, but the instructors are powerful and the studio is very clean with friendly staff. I am definitely planning to buy a class card when my intro membership ends!<//Text>

I have been doing yoga at Zuda for 6 or 7 years now! I love Zuda Sacramento for its wonderful teachers and opportunities to make my yoga practice whatever I want or need for myself that day. Some days it’s a crazy hard workout. Other times it’s some fun vinyasa flows and great music. And some of my favorite practices  are  classes with Anne Marie— her vivaciousness and authenticity as a yoga coach, mom, and inspiring woman just fuels my soul. I always tell my kids when encouraging them to find their own “yoga” or mindfulness outlet— you never come out of Zuda feeling the same way you went in. It changes your thinking, redirects your energy  and simply makes your body feel good! 5 stars to the Zuda Sacramento team! Your Zuda team rocks!!< /review>

Zuda is awesome if you are looking for an active yoga class. Yes, the classes are crowded, but my experience is that everyone just laughs and deals with it. The instructors, assistants, and front desk folks are always super warm and friendly.<//review>

Spacious, elegant venue, WONDERFUL long classes; you get a full hour of flow without skimping on meditation and shavasana. The first person I met when I walked into my first class complimented my perfume. Guys, Zuda is the yoga home you've been searching for!</Review>

I was new to the hot yoga scene, so I tried several studio's $30 for 30 days deals around town. I tried Zuda first and loved it, but wanted to see what other options were available.  I ultimately came back to Zuda because I loved their classes, their teachers and that most of their classes have assistants to help students into positions. Also, they are actually a hot yoga studio (heat and humidity) while most studios are barely warm. I always feel challenged when I attend Vinyasa. Thank you Zuda!</review>

The space- clean, open & welcoming

Instructors- offer challenging classes but provide modifications & encourage you to rest

Assistants- Amazibg! In class assists are so fantastic here! I went into child's pose and got a back & neck massage. This is all while dripping sweat, and the assistant did not seem to mind

Schedule- so many classes & easy to sign in

Overall, fantastic yoga experience!<//review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Great place to come to get your sweat and poses on! I love hot yoga and I like how there is a variety of instructors here to choose from. They offer several classes throughout the day. The instructors would also give massages to some yogis during class. It’s $20 to drop in or you can buy a package deal. It is expensive, not going to lie so I recommend getting the 30 day unlimited pass for $30 first before committing to anything. It can get pretty packed inside the room so I recommend coming at least 10 mins early to save a spot.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>I was introduced to Zuda Yoga about four years ago by my son, Colm.  He had purchased a “beginners series” for me as a Xmas present.  I had never done yoga before. Greatest gift ever. The instructors were top notch; more than helpful, upbeat, engaging and very informative. Unable to return for various reasons, my daughter gave me another Xmas gift of 10 sessions, this last year.   I went to the vinyasa and yin classes with my son. Felt so good afterward.  Really, really  great instructors!  The remodel is wonderful too.
Namaste!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1565733791172, 'text': 'Oh yes! We know Colm! So glad you gave it a try! Happy to have you!!'}< /resp><gmapID>0x809ad0ddb2ef9d23:0xdf37d15c321cb445</gmapID></record>

By far my favorite yoga studio! Very clean environment, friendly staff, in most classes assistants come around during class and help you with your poses/stretching and sometimes even give you a quick massage to help you relax. Would highly recommend! I haven't had an instructor that I didn't like.<//text>

I’ve been going to Zuda Yoga since March and completely love it. I normally go to the Monday and Wednesday evening classes with Kenny, but have had a few other instructors fill in when Kenny wasn’t available and have really enjoyed each instructor. They push you but also provide recommendations for modifications to anyone who isn’t able to fully partake in more difficult yoga positions. I always leave class feeling exhausted but equally rejuvenated. Totally recommend Zuda Yoga to anyone thinking about trying it out!<//review>

Zuda is an excellent way to take a break from the craziness of life and just be. Not only does it challenge me physically, but it also challenges me mentally. To learn to let go, to stay put, to rest, to go for it, to work hard. It's an opportunity to spend time with myself and focus on only me and my body. They have great instructors that all have their own nuance in the practice that has been fun to experience. I also love the new scheduling system. It actually made me come back to Zuda because it cut out the anxiety of a crowded lobby and rush to find a spot to put your mat. All I have to do is show up, check in, find the spot I booked, and that is all. It's such a relief!<//text>

Entering Zuda after a long day at work is always the best reward. From the moment I enter the building, staff are friendly and make you feel welcomed. The good vibes start before even beginning the class. The room is spacious and other students are friendly too. The teachers are all excellent as well. The playlists always complement the practices perfectly and the teachers follow a pace that challenges you physically and mentally. Best studio in Midtown!</text>

I have been doing the 30 for $30 this month which I bought and put off for months out of fear, since I'd never taken a yoga class!! But I am hooked! I don't know how I can't keep going at Zuda yoga when I complete this. I love it and the staff and instructots are absolutely amazing! Thanks for making yoga part of my life, Zuda Yoga!</text>

<Text>Not into the vibes of this studio. Felt unwelcomed...big clique energy. I don't like that the instructors do not offer an opportunity to opt out of assist, as many of us have injuries or feel uncomfortable with personal touch from strangers. One assistant touched me in an inappropriate way. Is the work out challenging and great? Yes! Are the instructors nice? Ehhh. Are the vibes of the studio akin to what yoga stands for? Absolutely not.

<Text>In general, a great place with very friendly instructors. I am fairly new to yoga so I don’t know many poses and didn’t know what to expect. They ease you into it, but the pace can be fast and I haven’t noticed much instruction in poses (at times it felt like they assume you know the majority of poses or how to get into them). But there is no judgement at all in terms of what you can or can’t do and what pace you need to go at for yourself which is nice. I like that they have many classes throughout the day and a variety of classes like yin and meditation to allow you to mix things up. It’s drfinitely a work-out in 85-90 degree rooms but you leave feeling very refreshed.<//Text>< pics>

I travel to Sacramento for work periodically throughout the year. I always make sure to fit Zuda into my schedule. They have a variety of classes early morning to late night to help all yogis squeeze their practice into their daily routine. I always walk out feeling inspired, refreshed, and connected.< /review>

<Text>I never liked yoga until I tried Zuda Yoga! My very first class was the All Levels one and that kicked my ass for sure but definitely doable to someone who isn’t stretchy/flexible (talking about myself). I’ve gone to multiple Level 1 classes and they go through the motions slowly so you can understand what needs to be done in a flow. I took my two best friends here and they loved it as well! I highly higly recommend Zuda Yoga to anyone!<//Text></record>

I love the vibe of this studio. If you're looking for ashtanga-style yoga classes and a strong sense of community this is a great place. They have some restorative classes too. You can tell the management really cares about everyone's experience and is working hard to better themselves and meet everyone's needs. They are super open to feedback and are constantly improving which I find awesome. Thanks Zuda!</review>

<Text>I love Zuda! Not only do they offer traditional Vinyasa style yoga, but they also offer Yin, Karma classes, and Sister Circle. One of the reasons Zuda really works for me though is that they have classes much later than other studios, so when I have to work late I can still get my yoga in. I've looked around Sac and there is really no other studio that compares to them.< /Text>< Pics>

Overall, Zuda is a wonderful yoga studio.  Plenty of class times to choose from throughout the day and the opportunity to focus on my beginner skills in the level 1 classes.  However, I do find it distracting how many people leave before the class is over.< /Text>

<review>In a single sentence: Zuda Yoga is the yoga studio you wish you joined yesterday.

What makes Zuda Yoga stand out is its yoga community, experienced instructors, and amazing classes.

The community is hands down awesome with everyone being so welcoming. And as a new face to Sacramento, I have felt instantly apart of a small community of warm and great people. For instructors, each one has their own style and are clearly experienced with practice which shows in each Vinyasa having a unique flow. And there is no better feeling than when you make your favorite instructor's class who's just as excited to see you there too! Lastly they have Ashtanga and Mysore classes! Plus kids classes!

I would and have recommended Zuda Yoga for new and old practitioners alike.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I go to Zuda when I visit my family in Sacramento. I love the space, the community is so vibrant and friendly, and the classes are sweaty and HARD (which is what I love). I haven’t had a bad class yet! ❤️❤️❤️<//Text>

We love Zuda.  My son loves the Sunday morning kids class with Savina and I love being able to get my practice in on a weekend.  We both love the run to the doughnut shop afterwards.  The Zuda culture is friendly, and open.  Be prepared to sweat and have fun.</review>

I recently started going to Zuda and bought the $30/30 day new student special.  It is a super great deal!  Zuda’s evening class times (6:15 and 8pm) have it easy for me to attend classes regularly.  They use an app for signing up for classes that’s really easy to use.  So far I’ve taken classes from Jojo, Zach, and Micheal.  They’re all good and all slightly different in their teaching style.  Zach’s class was my favorite so far.  Generally, I’ve enjoyed their Vinyasa classes (hot yoga) more than their Yin classes (kinda like restorative).  The Vinyasa classes are a great workout and a lot more fun than going to the gym.  I’ll continue attending Vinyasa classes here after my new student pass expires, but I prefer other studio’s not-hot yoga classes if I’m paying full-price.  It’d be cool if Zuda expanded the types of classes they offer in the evenings and weekends, but they’re great at what they’re known for - hot vinyasa flow yoga.<//review>

I did the 30 days for $30 membership to introduce myself to the studio and to get back into yoga. I previously had experience doing vinyasa yoga so even though I did the “All Levels” classes, I quickly learned that most of the instructors do not teach at a basic level and you need to know the names of the poses- if you don’t, you can always take a look around and there’s no shame in that! I have consistently been going to the 6am classes for over 3 weeks now, learning the different styles of three different instructors that teach in the mornings. I love that each instructor has a very different style of flows- Jen is fast-paced, challenging, a tough workout; Ann Marie (the owner) does poses that I have never heard of before, gives time for meditation, and does a routine “do it yourself” core workout; Jess is a bit in between, but I like her style the most because she has an ease to her that makes you feel more comfortable about going in child’s pose if you need to. I also really love that they always have an assistant going around, I just wish she could help me more- there’s usually too many people to go around! Overall, I’m really pleased with my experience at Zuda so far. I love sweating (a lot!) each morning and I am definitely getting stronger, physically and mentally. Unfortunately, I don’t think I’ll be able to afford their monthly membership. If only it were a little cheaper! Thank you Zuda!< /Text>

<text>Zuda is yoga, workout, church, and chapel. Seriously, this is a community yoga centre, with so much more than just yoga. Everyone here breathes energy and spirit, truly embodying peace, power, hard work, dedication, and love. I've never felt this energy at another yoga studio, and it keeps me coming back for more.

The classes vary in style and difficulty. They tend to get packed -- and if you're open-minded, you start to like that. Everyone moving together in moving mediation, energy flowing around the room. They keep the rooms heated, but in winter especially, this is super comfortable. I find that it's to a great level that allows me to get deeper into my poses and to feel rejuvenated afterwards, without totally draining me of all my water the way hot yoga tends to. The instructors are the best of the best. My favorites are Joel and Jess, but they're all amazing! The assistants really help you explore those extra inches in your poses and give the BEST massages while you're in them.

The system here is geared towards helping each person explore whatever it is they need to explore. There's also assistant training, teacher training, flight school, sisterhood circle, and even a yoga retreat to Bali. Seriously, it doesn't get better.

Introductory rate is 30 days for $30. You can't beat that. And, if you come consistently enough, you will start to feel the incredible power of Zuda within you. Come by, give it a whirl, be open minded, and let it change your life!<//text><Time>1520315043148< /Time></record></dataset><record>

They put the POWER in power vinyasa, phew!! I have only been to this studio five times, but can already feel my body becoming stronger and more toned. A fun environment with loads of different teachers, offering pretty intense, sweaty yoga workouts, as well as a lovely, classical Ashtanga class on Sunday mornings- my fav. The studio really prioritizes it's community and clients, and you can feel it. I'm loving it...thanks Zuda!</Review>

<time>1556149006526</time><Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I like this yoga studio, it's clean and convenient for me but I do have some important things to say. This studio does NOT seem like it's meant for beginners, if you've had zero yoga classes, I don't think you should start here! I've done just a few bikram hot yoga classes before and I discovered, of course, that Vinyasa is harder because it is a faster pace. Not all of the classes, level 1 or all levels,  go over yoga poses! So if you are new I suggest you sit in the back to be able to watch others.

I do love that the Zuda yoga studios are non judgemental and you can really do whatever you want. It's just if you are waiting for someone to help or correct your pose, it most likely won't happen. I haven't had any pose help from the assistants, but I do get massages! If you're comfortable with just going with the flow and flip flopping around as beginner then you'll be okay at this studio! lol This place is convenient for me and it has gotten me used to practicing around a lot of people. I like how you can reserve your yoga mat spot before the classes, ever since they started the new booking method, there has been less people in classes! Which is kind of nice because it was really packed before (at anytime).</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Out of all the hot yoga places I've ever tried for Power Vinyasa, Zuda Yoga stands out as the clear favorite. You will NOT be disappointed!! The instructors are always so welcoming, knowledgable, and genuinely kind.  All exude a non-judgmental attitude, while still encouraging you to push past your own set-limitations.They seriously do a GREAT job of changing up poses and the meditation portions without it ever feeling forced. Also, they are very good about coming around to correct your pose or posture; they will even help you get that extra stretch! You will walk out feeling physically worked (which I can't say for all yoga places) yet completely rejuvenated. :) I can honestly say that practicing here has helped me become a more relaxed and grateful person. I totally recommend trying it!! :)<//Review><resp>None< /resp></record>

Zuda yoga has been my favorite yoga studio basically since I started practicing.

I have tried many yoga studios in the area but none of them had as good of teachers in my opinion.

The classes can get crowded in the evenings and weekends so i try to go on weekdays during the day as much as I can</text>

It is a great atmosphere although i did forget my mat once and they are pretty strict with not lending them out in the event of an emergency which I found a little too strict after I had already paid for parking and the 30 min drive to get there.<//Text>

< Review>
LOVE Zuda! I have no ability in comparing Yoga studios or experiences between Zuda and elsewhere, because I visited Zuda once as a guest, and have come back for their 30 for 30 and now a 10 class membership without hesitation..or desire to look somewhere else. I've gotten to know a few of the instructors, as they are now members of the CrossFit gym I belong to, and the cross training between practices is super helpful in all areas of my fitness. Everyone...instructors, staff and members of Zuda are all very welcoming and helpful when trying to discover my own abilities in the practice. I would highly recommend anyone from Yoga enthusiast to newbie, to check out Zuda. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed!<//Review>

< Review>
Zuda is a special place, and the people make it that way. The energy and vibes are like none other. I am inspired by the culture that Zuda is and crave the AM classes the most. Never have I felt so compelled to commit to teacher training in ten years of yoga practice. Unfortunately, my schedule prevents me from doing so this year; but to make up for that, I signed up for their 4-day, 35-hour yin and chakra training! The only thing I wish Zuda had more of are yin classes! Otherwise, keep doing what you're doing Zuda; you're bomb af! :)< /Review>

I decided to take the introductory series and I had a great time. Since I have a really busy schedule I go to classes whenever I can. Despite the problem to attend classes often I still get plenty of support from the instructors.<//Review>

<Text>The first time I came in I was greeted in a friendly matter, and when they learned I was new to the studio they thanked me for coming in and after we took care of the details of joining up. I did the 30 days for $30, they gave me a quick tour so I knew where everything was. Not every studio does this, and I really appreciated the extra care and customer service. It made me feel welcome and appreciated. Thanks guys! Inside it’s nicely decorated and really clean. They have two studios and a lot of classes which makes it easy for me to get down there, even with my busy schedule.

The vinyasa classes I’ve been too are fun and energetic, the music they play is great and they have assistants that come around and massage you! What!? So nice!  They also teach Mysore Ashtanga, which I had never really heard of but after learning that it was a set series of postures I was really curious because I’d been practicing Bikram style yoga for a few years and sometimes I really like the predictability and order of a class that is the same postures in the same order every time. I feel like I can judge my progress better etc...
They have 3 days a week where they have a teacher there who walks around and guides and assists you through the postures. I have had Marie and James in the Ashtanga classes they were both really friendly, and super helpful.The indidviual attention is great and learned a lot in just the few classes I’ve been to so far. Ok, kind of nerdy but I’m really excited to have this whole new kind of yoga to learn and progress in. Thanks Marie and James for all your help and assistance and thanks to the owner and the rest of the staff for giving me such a great place to come and get my practice on! See y’all soon!

Love,

Matteo< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>The shop owner/manager was very reasonable and professional!! I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes! I DEFINITELY will be going back. NOBODY else in the area had my size tire in stock; not only did he have the size, HE HAD THE SAME EXACT BRAND AS MY OTHER TIRES! Quality service!!

Honestly great prices, fast and exceptional service!! I went to so many places to get my tires changed , they all were crazy expensive.  I finally came here and It was perfect 👌 they even recommended me to a great place to get my alignment.  This tire shop isn't trying to get rich of one client.<//Text>

Pedro and Rosa we’re sincerely nice and ready to help me when I came in with my car after having a brake issue. They reached out and went out of their way to find the problem and also solve it. Amazing deals on brand new tires and everyone there is surprisingly nice! Highly recommend this business!<//text>

Very fast and super friendly. Anytime I need tires I always come here. They're very reasonable on their prices and they care more about making sure you're safe vs trying to sell you anything like these other places. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for being trustworthy.< /text>

< Review>
This tire company is very helpful. I needed to buy two used tires they had them relatively inexpensive price and a good Tire. They also have new tires and very inexpensive prices when I could afford it that's where I'm going to go to get all four tires new on my vehicle. Their service representatives are very very helpful and quick at what they do.< /Review>

This is the place to go for tires. Visited here because it was highly recommended by a friend. Quick and thorough service at great prices. Replaced all 4 tires on my '15 Subaru Forester and saved over $200 compared to the dealer. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.< /Review>

<review>I can't think of anything negative about my visit. I called him when he opened to get my tire repaired. I was in and out in under 15 minutes. $13.
I asked him if the repairs last and he stated they do because he puts the patch on the inside. Sounds logical.
Super friendly owner. Family run. Great prices on new tires, too.</review>< Rate>

<review>Family-owned and operated tire shop in Vista. They are a bit tucked in off the street inside the Olive Melrose Olive Center, but they are a true gem. They have a large selection on-site, and when you buy tires from them they provide free rotations, balancing, and patching for the lifetime of your tires. Great customer service, and fast. I'll be back in 6 months for my rotation and balancing! :D Thanks MC Tires!!!<//review>< Name>

The chicken is SO good. This is well priced food for the bay. The salsas and roasted jalapeños are properly spicy. The rice and beans are delicious. This is comfort food! I would take my abuelita here to eat.< /Text>

Terrible customer service. This time I forgot to check my order and when I got home I was a quesabirria short, no tortillas that usually como with chicken and my chicken was not cooked all the way. No way I'm going back there and risk getting salmonella!!<//review>

They are awesome they helped get all my stuff hooked up protected and we had plenty of laughs in doing it all. They taught me stuff I didn't know about.  I recommend this place to get your phone tablet or what you need for any of that stuff there. Very helpful.< /review>

Gabe and the other assistant manager(i apologise profusely for not remembering. I am awful with names) are geniuses. It seems they have a good team at that store right now. I gauge it on how many familiar faces I see in associates. Thank you again, guys!!!</text>

< review>
I came to this specific location because it is a corporate store. It's big and spacious. That's about the only good thing I can say. I came to ask about getting my phone fixed. I pay over $100 a month and I have insurance on it. The phone itself has the GPS settings burned onto the screen. You can see them no matter what app I'm using and it's really annoying to see them there. I walk in and am instantly greeted. Forgot the guys name but I can tell he had good intentions. I tell him my problem and show him the phone. He then tells me they don't fix phones or do any type of repairs at this location. Turns out they don't have tech guys for that sort of thing. I ask what type of services they offer? He then tells me I can pay my bill and they can help me with upgrades or go over my phone plan if I have questions about that. I respond, in a calm manner, so this corporate store can only sell me phones and services? He says, no we can do simple repairs that don't require tech guys. And I add, but you can't replace my screen or even make an effort to see if I can get a warranty replacement? He then tells me I have to go all the way to Lodi, because that is the only corporate store that has tech guys on site, to get my phone fixed. I add one last time, so you can't do anything for me but sell me phones and services? He says no. Unfortunately only the Lodi location, being the closest, can help you. Like are you serious? This is absurd. Absolutely ridiculous. I had just came from the metro store around the corner, girlfriend's phone had issues, and even they had way better customer service than this. They actually ordered her a new phone and it wasn't even under warranty so how can sprint, being sprint, not even budge for a loyal customer. Maybe THAT was sprint being sprint. Literally, why even pay for insurance when I can't walk into a corporate store to make a claim. A legitimate one at that. Total waste of time, don't ever come to this location, seriously. Unless you just want to upgrade or buy more services. The phone in question is a Samsung galaxy s7. Friday October 27, at about 7:15 pm is when I visited this location. I've been with them for about 5 years and It's the first time I've ever needed to make an insurance claim.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>First time purchasing an iPhone...
Heavy breathing, claustrophobic, really hot inside. My sales rep Marilyn kept asking me if I was ready to proceed forward numerous times. Felt hostile to the situation as she previously mentioned she was off @6 and it was 9:30 lol who does that. My Paul Blanco car buying experience was much easier than leasing the iPhone 6s and they approved me with a 22.9% interest loan. Eventually she started explaining in depth features of the phone as well as the plan and what I was getting with my package. She made the experience fun and was just looking out for me. Overall she took great care of me and I love my new IPhone 6s. Best Customer service hands down go check her out.
Merry Christmas

<Text>The worst costumer services. They have you sign in when they feel like so they don't know who got there first. Then they ignore the list and just yell out "whose next". These employees are so unprofessional they told customers to go to another sprint bc they were to busy and were laughing about it. The manager has not done their job and trained these workers</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>The Manager Classifies Customers, Racial Profiles Everyone, i Observed Him Very Well The Way He Is With Certain People He Will send you to a certain customer service rep based on appereance, Manager Is A Sexist.
he took care of white customers very friendly.
He was very short on conversations with colored people.

My name was up on a screen First to be up with customer service, he acted like he didnt see me . Taunting me and started to help 2 young girls smiling he did it again while i was checking out phones, I have tattoos all up to my neck he kept ignoring me. Deleted my name from screen pretended like as if i was a ghost, He Told Jeff To Take Care Of Me Last .

I WALKED INN AFTER I FINISHED A APPLICATION OVER THE PHONE WITH SPRINT CREDIT DEPARTMENT. SO BEFORE I COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH APPLICATION  ACCOUNT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE VERIFIED. I EXPLAINED TO THE INDIVIDUAL I JUST NEEDED TO CONFIRM MY IDENTITY.
JEFF STARTED ANOTHER APPLICATION
RAN MY CREDIT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.
AFTER HE GOT OFF THE PHONE HE SAID HE APOLAGIZED AND TO APPLY AGAIN IN 60 DAYS. I ALREADY HAD AN ACCOUNT ALREADY HAD AN APPLICATION PENDING OVER THE PHONE, THIS PERSON RUNS MY CREDIT AGAIN WITHOUT ASKING ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT. I WILL SUE THIS COMPANY VERY SOON. JEFF AND YOUR MANAGER WILL HEAR FROM BBB VERY SOON I RECORDED EVERYTHING.

AMERICA - EQUAL RIGHTS TO EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU VIOLATED BILL OF RIGHTS. WE THE PEOPLE.

YOU AINT NO EQUAL RIGHTS AMERICAN, YOU EMBARRASE THE AMERICAN FLAG AS AN AMERICAN YOU HAVE ALOT OF NERVE TREATING PEOPLE THIS WAY DONT KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAD TO GO THRU TO BECOME MANAGER. JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN LOSE IT ALL IN ONE MISTAKE.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

If you live in Stockton, Sprint has to be among the worst things in the world to deal with. No signal anywhere hardly. The majority of the phones are LTE equipped with no WiMax 4g capability meaning you only have 3g coverage if you are lucky enough to get a signal for even that. I am stuck in a contract that is not financially reasonable to break free of, and my current phone is having issues which means I need to replace it. I do not look forward to my future as a Sprint customer, but I do need a new phone right now. Leaving me with only the choice of a new contract and subsidized phone.

I will say that after I spoke with Christopher at Sprint today I did feel that the problems with sprint are not the fault of the individual stores and that his suggestion and help today was probably the only positive Sprint related experience I've ever had.</Text>

<Review>Sprint has all the requirements to be one of the worst cellphone companies in the U.S.A.

But specifically talking about this store the waiting time to be attended is insanely long

Did I mention that the employees at this place are also very slow some of them very rude and like other reviewer said these people scann your ID everytime they need to access your account which in my opinion that is not right

They offer you insurance for your phone but their repair service is among the worst they only have technicians in certain areas, we have to drive 45 minutes to get our phone fixed then leave the phone for 3 to 5 days to drive another 45 minutes to go picked it up very inconvinient!

The deductibles are also insanely high here are some examples:

For fixing a broken screen: $100
For replacing your phone with an used one: $200

Just do the math, the most common problems for a phone owner is a broken glass screen.

in my case is an iphone 7 if I would take it to a certified store to get it fixed it will cost me $170 you would probably say: thats a 70 dollar difference but the thing is that I been paying insurance for more than a year 14 months to be exact 13 dollars a month so basically I will be paying sprint $282 for getting my phone fixed

That is terrible! And thats my story planning to dumped this horrible company in the following months

I almost forget to mention that sprint also has one of the worst coverage in this country</Review>< pics>

<text>We went here for my mom’s birthday yesterday. Awesome customer service- everyone who worked there seemed genuinely happy. We loved the atmosphere and my 5 year old son was obsessed with the trains going by. The food was delicious! We will definitely be going back.<//text>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Found our new favorite spot in San Mateo! They have the best pizzas, great cocktails, beautiful decor and amazing music. It feels like grand central station inside. Rise is actually located in a train station so you can watch the trains go by while you dine. You can’t even hear the trains, so the mood is kept intact. The vibe of this place is seriously unreal! The pizzas are to die for, the deserts are ridiculous (we tried the pumpkin cheesecake and the brownie). All in all one of the best places you can go on the peninsula. If you haven’t been, your are seriously missing out. They just opened and the word has not hit the street yet about how absolutely amazing this place is. If you just read this, get in your car and drive there now. You can thank me later.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwpBT3l7FOO8ehE58bnXP9WB7IaNRXp1pfN7QJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1VlM6aqIBc_BUwyxV3SSquRF-9Fb28YfiSRYp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMYg48Btn3B4jXHbetlkl803Veyzb32tizEKpR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPbo8kChr9cTOz_fLIx-28FimzCnzIFeZ7MUYx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKImsWMz3uzsXVEznbKrGaoArdS4QuGIGwxM6_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNASgdu-AKEsUzU2B-6Go5xwDWSZJx3AkrNxl9v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0B8k30HiZTnB9iu9lQf-EXax08HRIQfjz30w2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<Review>Gave me food poisoning!
LOVED this place - past tense. Went for Valentine’s and enjoyed it and also for my sons birthday and had a blast.
But two nights ago, I ordered the same BBQ chicken pizza that I had the previous times and it made me violently ill with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever received. I was up all night being sick and through most of the next day as well when the symptoms finally let up. Now I’m on Day 2 and still having stomach pain.
So - wow - great atmosphere and cool place. But clearly they have some issues with either their chicken cooking or storage routines.</Review>< pics>

Good, but nothing spectacular. Will i return? Sure. They add to the bill an automatic 20% gratuity + another percentage for the workers' benefit (i forgot what they call it). This business model is something i really couldn't get behind. If you're going to have your customers pay for your workers because you can't do it yourself, you shouldn't be in business. Tacking % on the bill is tacky. I dont mind paying more for good food as long as I can trust that workers are paid right and the food is excellent. Hire an accountant to properly and fairly price your food and none of that auto 20%++ -- my apologies, i digress. This is for another forum.<//review>

Great atmosphere and service, food was a bit "meh"...

I'm going to chock this up to the fact that we came at the end of the night on a Thursday. Not that this makes it ok, but we'll give it another shot.

The hummus as an app was "ok" but could use way more spices - the toppings were nice and fresh though. We would have liked it to come with some fresh veg as well (carrots/etc to dip) as the ratio of hummus to pita that they give is way off.

My wife ordered the prime rib, which was a good generous portion, but again, it didn't seem to have much seasoning  (nor did the marbled potatoes).

I ordered a pizza (ham, pineapple and jalapeno that is on the menu) and it too seemed bland (are you seeing a pattern yet?). The toppings on the pizza were generous, however the crust was not very crispy.

Service was pretty quick and our server was very nice and thoughtful.

Something to note - tip is included in the bill, and they don't ask you to sign your credit card receipt. I don't like either of these things. I tip WELL for good service, and I tip for mediocre service. If a restaurant FORCES a tip on the customer, then just remove the tip and raise your price, and pay your staff more per hour. That left a sour taste in my mouth. And the fact that I didn't have to sign for a bill of more than $100 offers very little protection for either party - just poor practice in my opinion.

Like I said, we'll give it another shot, but I'm not getting my hopes up.</text>

We are regulars at Rise Pizzeria in Burlingame, and this Rise Woodfire just raised the bar! All the food we ordered was excellent, and the remodel at the train station is really well done. I'm sure we'll become regulars here too!<//Text>

<Review>I was so looking forward to Rise as I am a pizza enthusiast.  While I thought the food was tasty and the atmosphere was great, the service offered by out waitress was the worst we have experienced in years.  Maybe she was new to the role or just hadn't been a waitress in a while because of COVID, but she had no interest in attending to our table, which was unfortunate because of the mandatory 20% tip.  We actually wanted to order drinks, but she never stopped by the table other than to take our food order and deliver the food.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Love this pizza! So many amazing combos, old train station location and next to so many good walkable restaurants and coffee shops so you can have the 4 or 5 course meal of ur dreams in the car with a little bit of each restaurant!</review>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Was here when restaurant opened a few months ago, service was great. I actually came back because food + waiter and staff were so nice.

This time, food great, drinks ok, even host staff at front were good. I excused the operational disheveled feeling because who can manage a restaurant during a pandemic, really?

I agree with other guy who was here a couple of days ago, a female waitress who was waiting tables in the back “outdoor” area was not friendly. Whoever she was, scheduled Friday 2/26, after 7:30 pm or so. Ordered white sauce for my pizza, I got red. Not a huge deal at all. Pizza was still tasty. It was the service that wrecked it. She didn’t check in once. Walked by several times, didn’t offer to take get another order on drinks til we were halfway done, again, not asking how anything was. At all. NOT ONCE. Literally walked up, asked is if we needed a box, brought us a box. Got us the check, again no thank you or ask how anything was. Came back with the check and verbatim said, “there’s no pen because tip is included.”

Honestly, if tips are shared, she doesn’t deserve the same amount as the other guy who I saw being much better with his tables (and he was a waiter, not busser), and even checked in on us. I tried to chalk it up to her having a bad day, but, man, not a good vibe and not nice.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1617718739296< /Time><rating>4<//rating><text>This restaurant has good days and bad days. Their food isn't always consistent. When it's good, their napolean pizza is perfectly baked, leaving a few crunchy bits, but having that perfect chewy middle with high quality tomatoes and cheese, and a fragrant drizzle of olive oil. The first time, their prime rib sandwich with a dipping jus was luxurious with moist meat, perfectly toasted bread, and a strong horseradish sauce on the side.  Unfortunately, the second time around, the meat was dry, the jus was salty, and the pizza was underdone.< /text>< Pics>

Pizza was great, pricing is reasonable. However some staff wore strong perfume (may be scented detergent/fabric softener) which spoiled the dining experience. All restaurants and food services must be fragrance-free to enjoy food as well as for better hygiene because artificial fragrances are actually bad for health. CDC prohibits their employees to use any kind of fragrances.</text>

I was thrilled to finally find a local restaurant that offers boquerones (white anchovies) as a pizza topping. Also, they sell quality half-bottle wines, and the online ordering experience, including Apple Pay, was flawless. Other restaurants should take note.< /text>

Food here is delicious it is a little on the pricey side but if you can get past that its definitely a really nice place to eat.
They have an outdoor patio with heat lamps they also have a kids menu they already add 20% to your bill so you dont tip kinda weird but is what it is staff are very friendly and professional all in all a nice clean place to eat and feel comfortable $$$< /text>

Really flavorful food across the menu. We loved the Mac and cheese with bacon and the buffalo chicken wings. My favorite was the jalapeño corn bread. The BBQ chicken pizza and medjool date pizza were both excellent. The service was friendly and the manager came by twice to ask how we liked the drinks and food. They have a decent selection of cocktails and are expanding their bar selection. They’ve only been open 3 weeks - give them a try!< /Text>

It's 2021. Stay at home order extended indefinitely. Political unrest in the nation's capitol. This coincides with my Mom's birthday. She says  as she is flumoxed by the world situation. " Oh, just order a pizza_"..
I chose Rise Woodfire based on online reviews and local press.. They exceeded every expectation and transformed the day into a memorable celebration.  The Cesar Salad was fresh and crisp; the veggie pizza ( with the addition of pepperoni)  was superb. One of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. Practically perfect in every way. The flourless chocolate cake was sublime and unforgettable. The meal was beautifully complemented by a bottle of Rose of Pinot Noir wine. Outstanding experience. Truly impressive. Cannot wait till restrictions are lifted and I can dine with you in person.</Review>

What's that expression?  Life is short.  Eat dessert first!  Let's start with the two major winners.  Cherry pie and the brownie in a cookie.  They were fantastic.  Made in-house.  Yum and yum.  Cherry pie is a breakfast food, right?  You don't have to eat it after dinner because you'll be full.  I'm dying to try the pumpkin cheesecake next time.  The Chef obviously knows desserts.

For the main courses and sides, they were so delectable.  The roast chicken was delicious and moist.  Buttermilk/chive/horseradish sauce was a wonderful complement.  So was the Chimichurri sauce. Mac and cheese has more of a white cheddar sauce.  Delish.  Brussel sprouts were terrific...according to my friend because I can't stand them.  I had the coleslaw and loved it.  Had the Roast Beef last time which was also beautifully cooked.

Our cocktails were so well done.  I'm 100% looking forward to NO MORE Covid lockdown so I can go and dine in-person.  The space is absolutely stunning.  They really put in the thought and money to make this a real jewel in downtown San Mateo.< /text>

My daughter used to stop here after school and Elias always treated the kids with respect, providing them with a safe place to enjoy a taco and decompress from a busy day.
I’m vegan and really love the mixed veggie or the tofu burrito (with extra cilantro, onion and some slices of avocado please!) and am impressed with their “new” habanero salsa, it has a kick that makes me return for more!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Taco and Enchilada Al Pastor. Delicious.

It tastes as good as it looks.

I skipped breakfast today so treated myself to an early lunch. I haven't been here for a long while. I had forgotten how amazing their food is. Fed my body and soul.< /review>< userid>

If they had a feedback page, I would share these comments there, however, there is no feedback page, so here goes.

The Good
-Very tasty food.
-Excellent spicing.
-Fast

The Not So Good
- The carnitas were excellent except for the taste of griddle shortening peaking through.
- The Chile Relleno and beans were also very tasty except for the Chile pepper itself, which I could not cut without getting a sharp knife and took a long time to chew.  My guess is that it was frozen and quickly defrosted and sauced.  This problem could have been because of the pandemic — no way to tell how many orders of what to expect.  Should be a more effective way to defrost a pepper.

This place could be amazing.</text>

The food was good, but a warning - their website posted here on Google has a delivery option that does not actually work. I paid a delivery fee, had an estimated time of arrival, and even got a phone call confirming I would need to be present to show my credit card to the delivery driver. Three hours later, I called the restaurant who said my food had been waiting, and I had to pick it up because they don't do delivery. I tried to order through them directly instead of a third party source and now I can't get any of those fees refunded. Do NOT order through the website!< /text>

I have been going to El Tarasco for years and their service and the quality of their food never ceases to amaze me. I get the same order almost every time and this is because it never gets old. Their super Carne Asada burrito is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. Go check out this locally own restaurant and support them!< /review>

<Review>After years and years of its being our local Sebastopol go-to place for Mexican food (especially for take-out when we're tired after a hard day's work and just want some of  the best Mexican comfort food ever), it's about time we give El Tarasco our five-star thumbs up rating and review. The food is consistent, delicious, authentic, fresh and of generous proportions. We love the staff, too. Go for it and you won't be disappointed!<//Review>< pictures>

Omg I love this place!! I’ve been coming here every Tuesday for the past several years. And I always bring a few friends. The food is awesome, portions are ample, price is right. The staff and the owner Elias and his son Diego take wonderful care of us and are like family. WE LOVE EL TARASCO!!!</review>

I ordered take out.
#3 (2) cheese enchiladas, (1) Ground Beef Taco & Beans.
what I got was the,
#18 (1) Chile Relleno, rice & Beans.
3 doesn't even sound like 18.
it's not even remotely close to what I ordered. damn so not happy.
I was starving and ate it anyway.
I love your place.
I just want what I ordered.
tried calling no answer

Years ago I frequented this restaurant when I lived in Sebastopol. I recently moved back to the area and pleasantly found El Tarasco still in operation.  The food,  atmosphere and staff is exactly how I remembered.   Absolutely superb.</Review>

<text>Ordered take out from here on Christmas Eve. The food was impeccable! I so wish I could have a nice dine-in meal here, because when I went in to pick up, the ambience was really lovely and the staff person on deck was super duper nice. Some day! In the meantime, the food stands up well to take away service (and very neatly plated in takeout boxes!), so I will keep ordering from here. I want to try everything on the menu!<//text></record>

<review>Amazing food and excellent service. What more could you ask for? Extremely surprised to find a restaurant of this quality a few miles from my home in Vallejo. This is easily on par with some of the best restaurants you’ll find in Napa. Hidden in a small shopping complex off the 29 is not where you would expect to find food of this caliber. What they did with the appetizers was both creative and delightful. Asparagus with a fried hard boiled egg, brussels sprouts with a sweet vinaigrette of some type, steak and chicken were delicious. Went back a few days later to try the burger. It did not disappoint.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Where to even begin with this amazing restaurant!
My husband and I were visiting from Colorado for just a weekend getaway. After a few glasses of AMAZING Pinots, we got talking to our waitress about the local wineries in the area. She was not only so sweet, attentive and wonderful to us, we felt like we had been old friends for years.
Next, the food. We have never tried Nepal food before so we were a little hesitant! DONT BE. We did not have a single thing (including dessert) that we didn’t like. The chef is incredible. My husband is a very picky steak eater and he had no complaints about his New York Strip.
This restaurant is the real deal- the staff is the foundation of it. Thank you Dawa for a wonderful first day in California! (We also already made a reservation to come back tomorrow....)<//text><Rating>5<//Rating><user_name>Venett Johnson<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Moana and all of the employees were very friendly, helpful and funny!
The food was phenomenal!
Everything they recommended was delicious, from the Pork Belly appetizer to the Kulfi ice cream dessert!

Amazing place!
I'm lactose intolerant. I asked what I could have and was surprised that I was able to have my food slightly adjusted to accommodate my diet.
Great food & service. Priced right.</Review>

<text>Came to Laso for a birthday dinner from out of town. The  experience was an incredible conclusion to a long day of wine tasting and touring the NAPA area. The Brussels sprouts were heavenly, the salmon was cooked to perfection - perfect mix of tender and crunchy- truly bursting with flavor. The ambience and service were also excellent. Would definitely recommend.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Wow, just wow. We have lived in Am Can for 20 years now. Several nice places to eat, but when we want something different or extra good, we usually head up to Napa. Laso is a little set back from Hwy. 29, so we didn't notice it, and hadn't bothered to google places to eat near home in years, as we thought we knew them all. Well, we didn't. Laso opened a little over a year ago, and we were really missing out. So when we finally discovered them on a google search when we were looking for new food to try, we were so happy with absolutely everything. The food was so flavorful, out of this world! We had the beet salad, the squash curry soup, the lamb shank, the eggplant and the Momo dumplings. Everything was absolutely outstanding. We split a slice of  super cheesecake too. Service was fantastic and friendly. Eat local, can't recommend this place enough!!!</Text>

Came here for my birthday dinner with 6 of my friends after exploring the wineries in Napa for the day and the service here was highly commendable ! Every meal that we had was excellent from the Brussels sprouts, pork belly and beet salad for appetizers to the salmon, pappardelle, burger and steak that we had for our main meal. You’ve got to try the food here< /text>

<Text>In town for business and stopped in for lunch. It was great! Food was delicious, presented well, and the price wasn't outrageous. Wait staff and manager (owner?) were polite and attentive as well. They said they'd only been open for a little bit, but they definitely have a great restaurant.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Great place to dine for a special occasion with your loved one. Waiter is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food we ordered were magnificent and served with style. My only suggestion is that they should include the appetizer menu even on lunch hours. Reservation is highly recommended for this place is getting popular.</text>

Service was 10/10 food was 10/10 and the overall atmosphere was 10/10. A perfect restaraunt to host a small get together or intimate date for 2. Portion are adequate for full size plates, and the small bites are perfect to share amongst the table. Will definately be going back here again!< /Review>< date>

What a great place.  We stopped in for dinner and were so pleased at the ambiance, food quality, and service.  We had the beet salad as an appetizer, then for the main course a lamb dish and seafood pappardelle.  Also tried the Nepalese dessert (can’t remember what it was called) which was fabulous.  Nice wine selection as well.  We will be regular patrons.</Text>

<text>Wonderful new place in American Canyon!!!  First I was blown away by the decor!!! Loved loved loved it!! I was treated to a glass of sparkling as I walked in by a very handsome man who happen to be the owner. Placed a order to go but didn’t want to leave because the staff and chef were so attentive to all my needs. Staff was very well educated on full menu ,very impressed with every detail that was put into this place. Food is beautifully presented, excellent taste
Would I return? ABSOLUTELY thinking of having a party in there our door area later this month!! Five stars ⭐️

Stopped by for lunch and we had the Laso Burger and the chicken sandwich.
Both were just amazing.
We enjoyed lunch so much that we plan on going for dinner tomorrow.
Joshua and Ming were very friendly and attentive.
Definitely a place to go!<//text>

Let me first start that this place is nothing short of amazing.  I am from out of town and not only did the hotel recommend this restaurant but insisted... so I went and ...I am glad that I did. You see I am not from here and from the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed . Not only was the owner friendly but accommodating.  Truly something that was welcoming. Well.... I proceeded to meet an adorable couple who was celebrating her birthday. I wanted to ‘Pay it forward’. And So I did. Well when the bill came, I was shocked and ticked off that the bill for this cute little couple was over $1200!!!!  Panic struck and I was left with  just my heart beating a million times a minute and I simply wasn’t familiar with what was at hand. So....I questioned it, raising my voice that it was absurd of the amount......yah...you get the rest.  Well it turns out I did not have my #*\• readers on so the suggested tip looked like it was in the thousands but reality it wasn’t. Soooooo my long drawn out story is this.....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!  The owner not only was sympathetic but deserved a medal for even engaging in a farsighted baboon. And if you are the couple that received this gratis dinner.... please do me the solid and recommend this restaurant for you and your friends, coworkers, family. And if you are happening to come across this review....Go get some food from this place.  You will NOT regret it. The setting is magical. CHEERS!  BTW. Treat people with kindness. .<//Text>

One of the only upscale restaurants in the area! My fiancé and I are from Portland, OR and were staying in American Canyon. We wanted to find a unique and quality place for dinner so we came to Laso. The food was great! So flavorful! I had the scallops and he had the lamb shank. Our server was very friendly too! Great place.< /text>

Great customer service! My car was in and out in exactly the time they said it would be. Hopefully won't need a body shop again soon but if I do I'll definitely use G&C Auto Body. Thank you to the G&C team.< /Text>

Everyone was very attentive and friendly.. Had to have a  rental car too and was able to pick up at G&C.  Work done was perfect.  I was leaving for Labor Day and they drove my car to my house and picked up my rental.  Great experience and would recommend.< /review>

<text>G&C did great work for me! Great service, I worked with Dan and he took great care of my car. Kept me up to date on progress and they finished early. If I had to do more auto body repairs or knew somebody who needed it I’d go or send them back to G&C!!!< /text>< Response>

We live in a world where, so often, our expectations are tamped down do to the endless complexities that we run into and so it was amazing to find that G & C has found a way to coordinate every single need that a customer like me would have when an autobody repair needs to happen. First, their staff are all skilled and very nice and the car came out perfect. Second, their integration with my insurance company was seamless and took away any insurance company problems I might encounter.  Third , my Hertz rental car was there waiting for me when I dropped my car off for repairs... Couldn't have asked for a better experience.....< /review>

<review>i had a terrific experience with Mitch. he was very accommodating and worked with me through my insurance after someone backed into my car. the shop did a perfect job repairing and re-painting my bumper. the color was a perfect match. Mitch even delivered my car to a family members house since i couldn’t make it back in time before they closed. it was sparkling clean! hopefully i won’t need exterior repairs in the future, but if i do i’d definitely return!<//review><Gmap_id>0x808416162fc80c93:0x8e6587cfa86da66c</Gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Very, very professional.  Excellent service.  We’ve used them four times over the past few years and each repair was perfect.  Plus, they’re tied into our insurance carrier so the claim approval process is smooth.<//Review>

A truly great experience from start to finish. The staff( Mitch) was very attentive to our repair. We were constantly updated throughout the process. I asked for a "showroom finish" repair on my car, and that is exactly what I got.</text>

I was very impressed at how friendly and helpful they were.
I was also amazed at how they took it upon themselves to touch up another area that was not part of the original damage I had taken it in for and how fast they were at returning the vehicle back to me. I would definitely recommend G&C to anyone looking for car repair!<//text>

Well I wasn’t going to say anything, but since G and C keeps asking us to post a review, I will. They took twice as long as the estimated time to complete repairs. When my wife finally was able to come get her car, she was informed that one of their techs hit it in their parking lot and repairs would have to be re done. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Will rethink our body shop choice next time.<//Review>

I had my car repaired at Blake’s is Santa Rosa and it was a nightmare. The repairs were rushed and incomplete. Allstate did an amazing job of coordinating with G and C and made my whole situation so much better. G and C coordinated everything for me and made me feel well cared for. My car was pristine when I picked it up from them! I have since been back with other small repairs and will continue to recommend and use them in the future!!<//review>< pics>

They did EVERYTHING possible to get me through the pain and stress of banging up my car.  Not only was the work done quickly and done well, they cared that I was on vacation and there were no rentals to be had.

They are truly a part of the county that cares.  I can't recommend them highly enough.</Review>< Name>

< Review>
Had a great experience with G&C Autobody. One of our cars was in a minor accident and needed some body work. G&C handled the insurance paperwork and kept us in the loop via telephone the whole way. The work they did was great and we were really pleased with the outcome. The car looks as good as new.<//Review>

I've used G & C a couple of times over the years and they are the best, by far!  Very professional, very considerate and do a superior repair job.  My car was always returned as good as new and they made the entire experience hassle free.

I would definitely recommend G & C to anyone who needs this service.< /Review>

<Text>Have had two great experiences with G&S Autobody in Windsor & Santa Rosa.  I would not take my car anywhere else for body work!

Professional, prompt service.  Caution it is not your buddy's auto body workshop.  These are first rate facilities - you be glad to take your family to see.<//Text>< pictures>

Lucky me! I (knock on wood!) have only had this one experience with an auto body shop in all my years of driving. When my business was all done with C&G, I could not help but wonder "what was all the fuss that people make about dealing with body shops and insurance?"  Truly competent, fast, polite and professional.  Hope I don't have someone back into me again, but if I do, C&G is where I will head.   Thanks folks.< /text>

I highly recommend G&C Autobody in Windsor, CA.  I have been there three times, ranging from some significant body work to small fender-bender dings in a parking lot.  Each time they were very professional, courteous, and kept me in the loop as to what was going on.  Since each of those times I was not liable for the accidents, they were able to use the other party's insurance information to pay for the work without any issues or hassle.  They even provided me with a loaner car so I could commute to work.< /review>

A good experience from start to finish.  They did an excellent job, you could never tell there was a deep scratch along the fender of my car.  It was done quickly and when I had some trouble going to pick it up they delivered it to me and I live 45 minutes away!<//text>

<Review>I have been so impressed by the integrity and professionalism of this company.  We went with Solar Maintenance Pros because we had a great experience with them at a previous home.  When we moved out here we knew we wanted them to put solar on our barn.  We had the roof replaced with a standing seam metal roof so that the panels could be clamped in place.  There was a misunderstanding and the installers used a different kind of rail system that required them to drill holes.  We were pretty upset about it.  But Solar Maintenance Pros went above and beyond to make everything right.  They replaced the damaged roof panels and remounted the solar panels with the right kind of clamping rails and made sure that we were satisfied every step of the way.  Dawn was always available by email, text or phone and kept me informed of every step of the process.  When Ryan came out to do the electrical work he patiently explained everything he was doing and made sure to clean up any mess left behind when going in and out of the attic.  Sherene did a great job explaining everything about how to monitor the system.  Everyone I interacted with was friendly, honest and knowledgeable.  I am so thankful we went with Solar Maintenance Pros for this job, and we would recommend them again and again and again.<//Review></record>

Today your crew showed up for the first cleaning of our 38 panels.  They showed up on time, performed the work quickly, efficiently, and without excess noise or disturbance. Thanks for the great job. See the photos from their work. I included one photo to show what the panels looked like before. They did an excellent job. Enjoy the pictures below.</text>

<text>The whole process was very easy. Starting with our zoom meeting with our sales man . He was very clear and informative explains the costs, warranties and care of the system. The financing was easy and done quickly. The crew that came to install our solar system did an excellent job! They were polite and informative letting me know when they arrived and the process of installing along with the time frame. They cleaned up after themselves each day.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

From start to finish, Solar Maintenance Pros made the process of going solar easy.  They presented a well designed, extremely competitive proposal with zero sales pressure.  They thoroughly
answered all questions and set all expectations for our timeline.  They ended up installing 2 weeks ahead of schedule in the middle of July, which is unheard of.  Their whole team, from the project coordinator to the installers were a pleasure to work with. Couldn’t be happier and will happily recommend Solar Maintenance Pros to family, friends or anyone who will listen!<//text>

The communication from staff to client was exceptional. We were never left in the dark during any part of our solar process. The staff are friendly, professional and responsive. We are pleased with the value of product and service with Solar Negotiators. We would recommend them to anyone looking into solar energy!< /Review>

From the moment I reached out to them, to the time the job was completed , they have answered all my questions and provided competitive pricing that was fair to do the job.

Our process started in the fall of 2019.  Chuck came by and presented me with Solar Negotiators' proposal.
Chuck's presentation was easily understood, he was able to satisfactorily answer all my questions.  I had decided in favor of Solar Negotiators over the two other competitors I had met with.
Unfortunately I just wasn't quite ready to pull the trigger.  Fast forward to now, the fall of 2020.
My wife had scheduled three contractors to interview.  Chuck was first.  Near the end of his presentation I took my wife aside and asked her, "Do you think we need to see the other two contractors?"  She said, "Nope".
We signed Chuck and Solar Negotiators up and canceled the other two.
In very short order materials were scheduled to arrive, emails for permissions were received, the lead installer came by for a site visit and then the schedule was moved forward, next thing I new it was done.
Very professional, very clean and easy to talk to.
Shareen has just come by to present us with a fully functional system and demonstrate all the internet based and cell phone app based options to monitor all aspects of our system.
In short, Solar Negotiators have got their game down.  Honest, fair and without that "Used car salesmen" type of sales pressure.
I encourage invite you to join my wife and I to become a member of the Solar Negotiators' family!< /review>

Solar Maintainance Pros did an AWESOME job with the cleaning they did this week. I loved the report they emailed that included before and after photos. The two techs that came to the house texted us to let us know when they would arrive. The communication was excellent on all fronts. We are very pleased.</Text>

Just had my first cleaning with them and I can literally see the difference on the panels and most importantly on my energy produced.

They’re very organized and up on technology. I get calls, text and email reminders prior to appointment. But my favorite is the report they send once cleaning is done with before and after pictures along with a condition report.<//review>

Just want to mention that cleaning those panels is rather important, and Solar Maintenance Pros cleaned mine way way better than I can do myself.  I saw my production jump up after they cleaned my panels.  You can really see shiny panels when they're done.</Review>

<Review>I had originally set an appointment for 4/30. The day came and went and when I called them, they said they had 5/14 in their system. But they did show up on 5/14 and everything went without a hitch from there.

This was my first professional cleaning by any company and I would have expected some of the panels to clean up a little better, but that is probably my fault for rinsing them down with tap (hard water) and letting it air dry in the past. Probably what I see are some deposits left behind as a result of these old attempts at cleaning them and not because of the technician's work today.

All minor though, and not complaints. The phone reps have always been very friendly. The technician who showed up was also friendly and professional.

Finished in about an hour (39 panels) and was on his way.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

The team was very punctual, polite and professional. They did an efficient and clean work. Would strongly recommend them to other prospective solar power customers.</Review>

Love the whole process that Solar Maintenance Pros uses. Received my scheduled date for cleaning. Received a reminder with confirmation box to let everyone know date still worked. Reminder also provided name of technician. Technician called the morning of service to let me know he was 10 minutes away. Technician was super nice, went right to work, and did a great job. Absolute perfection on all fronts!!! I’m very pleased!!< /text>

Solar panels are cleaned but they showed up three days early. Didn’t have time to cancel service because of the local fires. They notified me 15 min in advance before cleaning when they said they they’d do it hours in advance. Wouldn’t use again.<//review>

The Solar man arrived at exactly 7 AM, the assigned time, and phoned me again at 7:50 with the report on what was done.  Unfortunately, that was still early in the morning for me and I'm not sure I understood what I was told.  I wish they had sent me a followup email to cover what was done and what still needed to be done.   But he was very efficient.<//text>

Purchased a cleaning/maintenance contract when I added new panels onto my existing system. That was about 3 months ago and unexpectedly SMP was at my home today to do a cleaning and inspection! Didn't think that panels could be all that dirty but I am more than happy to let them clean it right now.   Not expecting too much of a jump in efficiency this time but I will keep an eye on my readings.  I imagine the cleaning difference will be much greater next year when it has more time to get dirty.</review>

<text>Every single employee was dedicated to making our miracle of getting solar...they were with us every step of the way. They shared in our struggles, correction notices, emails, and the excitement of being connected. The entire staff and the special consultants we needed to complete our project have all had professionalism, dedication, and consideration for our special circumstances. Beginning with Jackie, Mike W, Collin, Brian, Mike,  the installation team, inspection team, clean up crew along with Josh B with Cutlass Consultants, and Taylor Designs every person at Solar Maintenance Pros and Solar Negotiators deserve an A + for going above and beyond our expectations!

The crew was courteous and advised of their arrival and let me know when the job was complete. The price for the service was very competitive.

My husband and I purchased Solar Panels one year ago from Solar Maintenance. Since then they have maintained them, and sent a report after their checks. I was very impressed with the fact that their report included exactly what they did along with photos. They not only cleaned the panels, they checked to make sure they were working properly, and also checked for any roof issues.  It's great to have the confidence that all is operating perfectly! I highly recommend Solar Maintenance Pros!</text>

So I was somewhat disappointed with the service I received today.  When I decided to use Solar Maintenance Pros for my panel cleaning I was told the service technicians would take before and after photos of the roof and panels (I was concerned about tile breakage during the service) and would check connections, wiring, inverter, etc.  The service kinda went like this; two technicians arrived at the house, went on the roof, one sprayed the panels the other used a brush.  When they were done one of the technicians knocked on my door and handed me an invoice.  As he walked away I asked about my roof tiles , if any were broke during the service.  He responded there were several cracked tiles to which I responded was odd because about 40 tiles were changed during the solar installation less than a year ago.  I expected for him to offer to show me before and after photos but he never offered.  Also, while I did not expect any issues, I was never told the system looked okay which one would expect if an inspection was a part of the service.  The bottom line is they came out cleaned the panels and left.  If a company claims to do specific things then the client should be advised of the observations, and I would have liked to see the before and after photos of my roof and panels.  Now I have to climb on the roof to look myself.  On a positive note the technicians did showed up on time and gave me a heads up phone call and from what I can see from the ground the panels look much better than before the service.</Text>

<review>This company has been a Godsend for us.  The installers ( a lease) had left a whole in the roof.  Chloe Fradue held my hand while I hired a lawyer to wind my way around fixing my home and having a clean functioning solar system.  Solar Maintenance Pros cleaned the roof and helped me identify the needs.  Thanks Solar Maintenance Pros!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<name>R Moore<//name><Time>1556222937125</Time><Rate>3</Rate><Review>I finally decided to get solar and knew I wanted a local company to do the installation.  I spent months researching and finally decided to go with Solar Negotiators (Now Solar Maintenance Pros), as they were local, had great reviews, and the owner was a Veteran, being a Veteran myself this played a big role.  I'll leave names out just to keep things as objective as possible.

I met with my sales representative and planned out my system.  I was paying cash as I didn't want to hassle with yet another loan.  As everyone who goes solar knows, it's a big investment and something that isn't taken lightly.  From this point, I was thoroughly satisfied with the process.

My project got turned over to the service team and I was assigned a service representative to oversee my project and be my point of contact from here on out.  This was February 22, 2019.  From here I was given the checklist and approximate timelines.

The Site Survey went off without any problems.  The plans were submitted and I signed off on it.  A few days later I was told there were problems with my plans and they sent over a second draft for my approval.  I signed the second draft and awaited install day.

Install day came and when I got home I noticed the panels were in the wrong area.  Long story short, the original plans were given to the installers, not the newest approved plans.  After a little back and forth, I think they did a great job on resolving this issue.  Instead of moving the rack, they just added a new rack and gave me 2 free panels to offset the shade issue and as a way to make up for the confusion on their end.

My system went from 4.7kW to 5.2kW.  Therefore it had to go back to the city for approval, which delayed the process.  I'm 62 days into my project; I have panels on my roof, an inverter on my wall, a brand new electrical panel and I'm still getting all my electricity from PG&E.  I'm just waiting to find out what the next step is, I've reached out and haven't got any communication back.

So all this to say the following:  I wish Solar Maintenance Pros did a better job with communication.  Maybe not everyday, but send an email at least every other day with a status, even if it's just "still waiting on the city to approve your project".  I worked in the service industry and I called my customer's everyday to let them know what was going on with their computer, they appreciated the constant communication.  It reassured them and let them know that their computer/project was important.  People want to know what's going on, especially with a project that costs so much.  This is a huge investment, I am by no means wealthy, so this took me a long time to save up for.  I don't like being left out in the dark.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x8094661ba5ae344b:0x401869785e64d343< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>From start to finish, it was smooth and friendly process.  System installation is clean and does not detract from the beauty of our home. The system delivers as promised and our electricity bill has been mitigated.  I recommend Solar Negotiators to anybody seeking to add this capability to their home or business.<//text>< Date>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Solar Negotiators/Solar Pros is in my opinion the only company to go with for Solar.   They are honest and ethical, and their prices really are the lowest around.  I like that they don't pigeon hole you into a single product and yet you still get the quality hardware and service/installation you'd expect from the very best out there.   (I know, I shopped 9 different solar companies before I selected them).

The maintenance benefit has proven to be great for us too.  They recommend the best times of year to come out and it's nice to have that taken care of in our contract with them.    That's another great time and money saver and frankly is good for your TrueUp too.

I highly recommend them!<//Review>< Pics>

I've had multiple transactions with SMP. They're fantastic! I can see that the business is focused on continued improvement in every aspect of their service delivery. I don't know how they could get any better, but somehow they do with each encounter I've had. SNP represents great value - unmatched service coupled with great pricing is a winning formula.< /text>

For $25 a month you get 24/7 monitoring of your solar system as well as 3 cleanings a year and if there is a problem with your solar panels they come out and fix it for you.
I started on Friday. They came Monday morning and cleaned the panels. I love this company!!!!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great company to work with, mostly because they are super responsive. I had a company who used to come every three months but then they just stopped showing up. I called another company, had an appointment for cleaning, and they never showed and never called. When I emailed Solar Maintenance Pros, I got a call five minutes later. We agreed to cleaning and the paperwork was emailed a few hours later. Reminder email that they were coming, invoice emailed after they were done. All very professional and my panels look great. Happy customer!< /text>

Daniel and Robyn are excellent customer service representatives. They answer all the questions and concerns I had. They followed up if there were any changes or just to check to see how things are going. And the installers were great too, fast and very efficient they also answer any questions that had during the install, poor guys even installed my panels in the rain that's dedication to make us customers very happy.

Excellent installation team and great interactions.  Great meeting after installation with system/warranty person.  Original sales person came twice, once to give sales presentation, once to follow up with contract.  He called for payment checks from credit union  immediately after installation, but before I felt all was completed.  Appears to be working correctly, but will have to go by office to confirm if I am deciphering reports correctly.<//Review>

The entire Solar Negotiators and Solar Maintenance Pros team have been amazing. From initial conversations through the final inspection they have communicated so efficiently and graciously. The work crews were quick and truly problem solvers so they could get the job done in a manner that pleased us. We were a bit nervous about how this would look once installed, but the system profile looks amazing. Thank you Solar Maintenance Pros!<//Review>

<Review>My solar panels are 12 years old installed by another company that unfortunately is no longer in business. I had an issue with one of my inverters and Solar Maintenance Pros came out and diagnosed my problem and I'm very pleased with them. The technician that came to my house was very pleasant to work with. I would recommend Solar Maintenance Pros to anybody who needs repairs or maintenance on their panels.</Review><Response>None< /Response><name>Terri Costa< /name><user>113985890309370070306</user></record>

Could have been better.  The re-roof wasn't complete when they left. Had to have them come back to install the flashing. Haven't received my antenna that should have been installed during the install. Now I'm just waiting for my orientation appointment.< /Text>

My experience was fanatic, not to mention very easy.  I sent my PG&E statements over to Mike, he looked at my annual usage and determined the system size I would need. After that we sat down to look at the options, I chose the system I wanted to go with and we did the paperwork. It was literally that easy.

Shortly after the installation while I was traveling for work we had an unrelated  electrical issue, but being out of town I had no way to diagnose the issue.  To try and get the power working for my wife and kids I called and asked if Solar Maintenance Pros could come check the panel, which was upgraded during install.  They came right out and even ended up changing a breaker to a higher amperage rating.

Fast forward a year and a half and I got a call that Solar Maintenance Pros were checking systems and I had 2 panel not producing.  I don't check my systems output often enough to catch things like that but again, they came out and fixed the problem immediately.

I couldn't be happier with my system or experience with both companies!</Text>

My panels have been installed and they look great I am now currently waiting for the connection. Having said that my experience has been overall positive one with Solar Maintenance company. Connecting with them is simple and they will answer all your questions. I will look forward to having solar for a long time to come and I would do it all over again with no regrets.</Text>

I had Solar negotiators install my solar system back in 2017. Back then Solar negotiators was separate company from Solar Maintanace Pro. But now that they are one company the review goes to both of them.

Back then when installing my solar system which included AC unit, we ran into some issues, but they resolved the issues and was still skeptical to leave a good review; instead I waited for their customer support on the first issue I had which is my inverter stopped working with the light on fault. Sure enough after calling them, Theresa. W was very professional she called me and emailed me and had informed all they way, they couldn’t solve it remotely so they sent the technician and solved the problem.

Now I can say thank you for standing behind your job and reward you with 5 stars review, and really recommend this company. As I said I don’t give 5 stars easily as I rely on reviews myself.</review>

<Review>Well its been a couple months but it was great. We called last week about getting a sooner cleaning than we scheduled. We had no idea how busy you are. On our end, we are trying to have your service to clean the panels, but trying to balance the number of cleanings (and which months) to make the service value balance any loss/gain of power and NEM charges. So far, ...great service by pros.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Chris And his entire team have always been professional ans courteous.  They answered all my question about solar in a way I could understand and it has been a delight doing business with them.  Not only that Chris from Solar negotiators saved me almost $10,000.00 over all the other competitors with the same system.  They are always ready to bat for you when it comes to service or even repair.  They do it right.  Thank you so much Solar Negotiators.< /Review>

This was a long researched project for us. We spent over 2 years researching & interviewing multiple solar installers. The price ranges from Sunrun, Tesla, etc were huge. Some were twice the price of Solar Negotiators!!

Our project was unique but not impossible and we needed some special things done for optimal production of our ground mount solar panels.

Again and again when we found the panels we wanted, the installation was too expensive. Then when we found an affordable installer he wanted use cheap solar panels or had bad reviews or wasn't local.

So here is how we made our decision.
Ask these questions:

How are their reviews on google, yelp, etc?
Are they a local company?
Are they knowledgeable on solar?
Do they come out and inspect the install site or use google earth?
How many installations have they done?
How often do they clean the panels?
What kind of warranty do they provide for loss production on the panels?

Happy to say Solar Negotiators checked all the boxes. We could not be happier with our experience with the install and customer service. They love what they do and it shows in their work and attention to detail.

I would highly recommend them to any of my closest friends.

**Remember that 2019 is the last year of the full 30% Fed Rebate**.

Called when they were on the way, arrived on time, solar panels now look new.  Aldo checked my power box to insure the output/ input was functioning properly.  Job well done and is cheaper than others in my area.<//Review>

<review>Solar Maintenance  Pros cleans the solar panels at my church. Collin and Bart showed up on time. I went out to meet them. They were very friendly and explained the service and the need. I was not told about cleaning the panels when I bought my home as they were already installed so it had been over 3 years. They badly needed to be cleaned.
The workers
were efficient and wore safety equipment which impressed me. I don't think they were here more than 1/2 hour setting up, cleaning panels, and clean up.
I highly recommend this company.

Solar Maintenance provided exceptional service! They cleaned my solar panels and did an amazing job. They took their time and performed a  thorough cleaning of each panel. I have a aluminum panel roof so it's very difficult to walk on but they were very careful and did not damage any part of the roof. Thank you Solar Maintenance Pros!<//text>

Great Service!  Awesome work done.  The guys came in and did their job, cleaned up everything (we had a real pigeon mess).  Pigeons are gone and everything is clean. We couldn’t be happier. Will definitely use this company in the future for cleaning our panels.  Very reasonably priced.</Text>

Had our solar panels cleaned. Our experience with Solar Maintenance Pros was excellent from the time we called to schedule an appointment to the tech who preformed the service cleaning. This was our first time having our panels cleaned and plan to use Solar Maintenance Pros for all my future service cleanings. Highly recommend.< /Review>

I recently added more solar panels to my existing system and after getting quotes from several solar companies I went with Solar Maintenance Pros . They were very professional and detailed with their
quote and there were no suprises . The installation went without any problems and on time. They overall provided a great value for their service.I also signed up for their solar panel cleaning service after getting several quotes , again they provided a gteat values for this service. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who is think about getting a solar panel system.<//Text>

I recently used Solar Maintenance Pros to install a critter guard around my panels. I had a huge pigeon population gathering and nesting underneath my panels causing noise, feathers, and bird poop everywhere. When I contacted them about my problem, RJ was very professional and polite. He gave me a competitive quote and we set up a date. The crew came out and installed everything in about 2 hours and didn't bother me at all. I received an email invoice shortly after and paid online easily with a point by point evaluation of my entire system! I highly recommend Solar Maintenance Pros for all my solar needs. They also come out twice a year to clean my panels. I wish I had gone with their parent company 'Solar Negotiators' for when I first decided to purchase solar. It would have saved me tons of money and stress. They are on it!<//Review>

These guys are terrific--- both in the field and in the office! We have a 48-panel ground-mount installation on our property east of Clovis, a very dusty location. The service from these folks has always been exceptional: available, responsive like a whiplash, professional, and super friendly. AND they even brought their own water for the cleanings during the worst of the drought so they wouldn't drain my well. Now that's service!<//text>

I got new panels through a BP Solar settlement, but needed a new inverter.  They have been professional, kept in touch every step of the way, and had the best pricing. I am very happy.  And when I got my first full bill and it was higher than expected they came right out to see what the problem was.< /text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Just received our second panel cleaning from Solar Maintenance Pros in mid June. They advised us of when they would complete the job and it was done as scheduled. They left a system check card showing the status of the system and all the panels looked clean!. Great job. I would highly recommend their service.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Very professional, easy scheduling, and easy to pay your bill.  When I call the staff is very friendly and the technician they sent out to do my cleaning was very helpful and made sure all of my questions were answered.  Solar Maintenance Pros definitely live up to the name!<//Review>

{'time': 1531326384956, 'text': "Hi Maggie,\nSomeone will be reaching out to you today to review the concerns you've dealt with in the past. We do not require the homeowner to be present while the cleanings are performed because they are scheduled in a time window, as we don't want to disrupt the client's day. We are so sorry that you were effected by this, and we'd like to offer you a free service when we speak with you. With professional panel cleanings, a visual inspection is performed of the whole system and a service report card is left behind with the customer upon completion detailing any issues if they are found. If you didn't receive one of these reports, please let us know. Thank you for your feedback, we look forward to speaking with you."}</response>
<text>So far I have had 2 free cleanings on my new panels and both times we've had scheduling problems meaning they give a time that they'll be here and they're HOURS late screwing up my whole day. I got a free cleaning because of the 1st scheduling problem that I will be using soon. I was told that when they're here they're supposed to inspect the solar unit which both times they never did.
UPDATE: Chloe called to resolve gave me 3 free scheduled cleaning. They were on-time and did a good job. Appreciate their effort to make things right!</text>< username>

Solar Maintenance Pros have been very professional to work with. They were flexible when scheduling and did a great job with the panel cleaning. They did the cleaning while we were not at home and I couldn’t tell that they were there. Nothing was out of place and they cleaned up after themselves.</text>

Solar Maintenance Pros came right in after my panels were put up and installed my critter guard before any pigeons could make a home and cleaned them as well making sure I was getting full useage right out of the gate.  So far I am extremely happy.</text>

Didn't show up for the scheduled 1-3pm cleaning appointment. Not even a courtesy call to save me the inconvenience of wasting an afternoon waiting. Understanding mishaps like this can occur I'd hoped to get the situation cleared up the next morning. It took two calls and waiting more than 4 hours to get the response that they had run out of time on my appointed day. Granted at that point I did get a weak almost apology. I was not impressed. In fact I was very disappointed with the lack of professionalism displayed overall . The only reason for the 2 stars was that when the rescheduled appointment was met the cleaning man was polite and efficient.< /Text>

Management does not care for their employees at all. Watched a guy worked without break until he had heat stroke (vomiting, cramps, disoriented). And I've never seen any of their employees using their safety gear. I will never call them cuz I don't want anyone falling to their death at my house.<//review>

<Text>Solar Maintenance Pro is awesome!!!! We had our panels cleaned and part of the cleaning service was an overall inspection of our system.  It was because of the inspection we found out our inverter was not working properly.

< review>
The extra care Solar Maintennace Pros provides (solar panel cleaning for life and free system monitoring for two years) is another factor that makes using the company even more attractive.

Shopped many solar companies and Solar Negotiators stood out. Chuck explained everything without any pressure at all. Just went live and looking forward to avoiding the PG&E rate increases.< /Review>

I had braced myself for the worst because I've heard people's leaking roof horror stories, but I was dead wrong! The crew was fast and friendly - their attention to detail was a huge cherry on top. The solar system looks good on my roof and I couldn't be any happier!</review>

I just purchased a solar system through the sister company Solar Negotiators and they delivered as promised and the installed Kuykendall Solar manned our 30 panel job with 4 guys and knocked it out in a day. Very pleased with the way this all worked. Thanks Chris and Robyn!<//Text>

<Text>Solar Maintenance Pros worked side by side with Energy Concepts to get my solar installed and operational. We had some challenges due to the cold and the frost on my roof but they kept us updated every step of the way. We love our system and everyone we worked with (Solar Negotiators, Energy Concepts, and Solar Maintenance Pro’s) was great!!!  We will be calling Solar Maintenance Pro’s in the future for panel cleaning and system checkup<//Text><gmap_id>0x8094661ba5ae344b:0x401869785e64d343<//gmap_id><rate>5< /rate>< username>

< Review>
The techs were friendly and fast.  They came to do check out a problem with an optimizer I had on one of my panels.  Replaced the part as it was under warranty. Scheduling the appointment was also a breeze, and the woman who answered the phone was nice as well.</Review>

<text>Solar Maintenance Pros are fast and professional.

We can not only SEE a difference visually on the panels (Fresno is pretty dusty), but we see an increase in panel output--which is always a good thing.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>
