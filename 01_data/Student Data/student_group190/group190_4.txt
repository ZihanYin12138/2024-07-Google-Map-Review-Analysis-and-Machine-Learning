I called in around 2 to get scheduled for an appointment around 6:10 and they confirmed they could take me. Then they decide to take walkins in front me and told me “ I thought you called about if we take walk ins” when I said no such thing. The place looks like a dump as well. Oh by the way it’s cash only... but the only sign that says it was half covered up and they never mentioned it over the phone. I would have sat there for another 30 minutes and wouldn’t of even been able to get a hair cut because I didn’t have cash on me. I recommend going somewhere else that’s a legitimate and professional business.</text><username>dylan deffenbaugh</username></record>

So I guess I'm the odd one out here with all the stellar reviews this place is getting. I just moved to the SCV area and was in need of a go to barber place and picked Andy's because of their great reviews. However, the experience was one of the worst haircuts I have ever received. My barber was a women who spoke very little English and I'm pretty sure she didn't understand my request at all since I got something that resembled a wanna-be sloppy attempt at a rock-a-billy hair do. I had asked for a short clippers on the side with a high taper and one an a half inches on the top that was blended with the sides. What I received was of poor quality and lacked skill. She didn't even touch the hair at the front of my head and left it abnormally long. Long story short, I went to fantastic Sam's down the street and they fixed it for 10$ and said she was poorly skilled and lacked any real training, and was appalled that she was cutting hair. I would not recommend this place whatsoever. With that said,, it has a nice ambiance and with this being the beauty industry I know skill-set varies greatly from barber to barber. With that said she had first chair which indicated that she was one of their better barbers. I will not be returning and I recommend RJ at the Fantastic Sam's by Aldi down the street.< /Text>

Love this barbershop. Since it's a small shop there's no feeling of rush. My barber, Danny, is very polite and personable. I'm sure the other barbers are as attentive to patrons needs and questions. Great shop all around.<//Text>

My mom is a hair dresser and she moved to Vegas. So I am kind of picky who does my kids hair. I take  my son there everytime he needs a haircut. And ever since the first day we walked into that place, it felt like home. Jesse who cuts his hair is such a nice man. Although he asks me everytime I come in when are we cutting your hair mom? Anyways, my son absolutely loves Jesse and I would not take my son anywhere else. The owner Carl is always there and he is also very friendly. The atmosphere in there is an awesome feeling. I can't explain it. I love taking my son there and he loves going. I'm not sure what the younger guys name is, but my son loves talking football with him. Everyone is so welcoming and like I said it just feels like home. The prices are great, the people are great, and Jesse really does a great job on my sons hair. I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//review>

Great place to watch sports or hang out with friends for few drinks.  But price went up like every other places.  No more combo deals.  I noticed that people order minimal and leave sooner than I expected.. I think it's the price.  Just for my self I spent $55.  I wish they can offer combo deals like before.</Text>

When in Buena Park looking for a decent bar with very good Korean bar food, this is the place to go. Beer selection as well as Korean wines and liquor are available. Food comes from the restaurant that is connected next door. Korean K-POP music videos and sports are shown on their large screen TVs.</Text>

The waitress had us sit outside even after we asked to sit inside.  There were a lot of people smoking in the parking lot and it really bothered us but she still wouldn't let us go inside even though other people were eating inside. She was not attentive and we always had to try a lot to get her attention. They get two stars because the food was really good even though the service was terrible.< /text>

Went here for some beer with a group of friends after our cricket game at the Smith Murphy park. Liked the collection of beers. Service was good. We ordered spicy wings which were good but the popcorn chicken wasnt that good. Definitely worth a try for a quick drink.</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>One of the last Korean bars in the area. The OG pine tree is gone, minsok Chon been gone like 20 times, and I don't want to go-to Hawaiian Gardens.

They have the right kind of chicken beer soju combos although I don't like how they butterfly the chicken, but that's because new school I suppose.

I usually end up here every time I'm back in the LA / Orange County area. Great place to catch up with the old crew.< /text>< response>

Likely one of the best Korean bars for drinks and food. Big menu. Tastes are pretty good. Attached to a quick food Korean restaurant and they share a kitchen.</text>

There is always an open table at this korean bar. It's pretty ambient with kpop music. The corn cheese we ordered was not that satisfying though.. I think this place is just good for mainly drinks.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I had a glass of draft beer in the marinated golbaengi, but the taste of the marinated golbaengi was slightly different, but it was edible.

Thank you for the best tint ever!!
I've been coming here for years with multipule cars and I have never had any problems that you see with other tints. No bubbles! No fading! It's perfect from day 1 and lasts for years with warranty included. And its DEFINITELY worth the wait for this kind of service!!! This time I went with the 5% ceramic tint for the 1st time. I cant wait to see the results of the heat reduction with the next generation window film.<//review>

STAY AWAY. I went in to get my lashes done for my wedding day. I wanted a dramatic cat eye and I let her know that before we started..

I ended up with tiny lashes that looked like they were bought at the dollar store.. I let them know immediately I was unhappy only for the girl who did my lashes to come to the front and proceed to be incredibly rude and condescending to me as well as other staff and my fiancé..

The nice lady at the front really tried to help the situation but I will never be back.

Definitely don't take the risk.. or waste your money here..

**** UPDATE TO THEIR RESPONSE THEY DID NOT AGAIN --DID NOT-- have another stylist "fix" them. They all fell out THE NIGHT BEFORE MY WEDDING DAY *******< /text>

I had my eyebrows done, she seemed worried and nervous had a tool she didn't know how to use, I left with all my hair and not only did she make me waste my time because I had to pluck them out my self. I made sure they had been aware of my dissatisfaction but decided to charge me for a service I had made an appointment for. What in their right mind gives them the right to charge my card if I was an unhappy customer. Awfully place their rookies<//Text>

<Review>MARTA! She is so sweet and did such an amazing job. If you can get in with her, definitely try! I really can’t emphasize enough how sweet and talented she is. Also, I love lash lounge for being the best in quality and value. Sign up for membership to get two hybrid fills.

I really love my new lashes!  I have had them about a month now and I am getting so many complements! The lounge is so clean and comfortable. Denise is so sweet and good at what she does. I am so relaxed that I usually get a nap. My lashes are very affordable and I love having the extra time in the morning and no raccoon eyes at night because I don’t use mascara anymore. I really recommend this lounge.</Review>

I LOVE this place! All of the Staff is Welcoming and Friendly they always offer me drinks when I come in and even have a welcome sign with my name on it! I've tried out almost all of their stylists and I've never had an issue they always make my lashes just like I want them. I also know more about lashes now more than ever because they even educate you on how it all works and how to take care of them after. I will NEVER go anywhere else! They have promotions to try them out and even a membership which I highly recommend getting it's worth every penny!<//Review>

It was my first time coming here and the lash stylist I had was DENISE. She is amazing! She went through the process with me, explaining the different kinds of lashes and services they offer. She’s very detailed which I really liked. She took her time, but really time efficient. She finished within the time of scheduled appointment. I will be coming back again. Thank you Denise!!!< /Text>

<Review>The BEST all around! The Lash Lounge in Orange excels in many things. I cannot say enough great things about them! They have a super professional & very organized staff at the front counter (they personally text me appointment reminders and ask about my experience, as well as are quick responding regarding any questions that I have), create an amazing atmosphere (always asking upon arrival each time if I would like anything to drink, and even had a welcome sign with my name on it last time I went), use the best quality products, AND have amazing stylists who really know what they’re doing! They go above and beyond when it comes to customer service, and even offer perks & promotions. I have been getting my lashes done by Lucy L. and she’s incredible...she’s so thorough and takes her time making sure that each lash is placed to perfection, and she also explains every part of the “lashing” process as she goes along which is very comforting! Every time, I’m in awe of how beautifully she does my lashes. Great job, Lash Lounge Orange!! I’m a happy & proud customer!< /Review>< time>

This place LOOKS BEAUTIFUL! however, the services are not great. It took my stylist over two hours to finish my lashes. My lashes fell out within TWO DAYS. Don’t waste money on this overpriced bad quality work. Amazing lash studio is was better!!< /review>

Love Alphy's! Awesome portions and very reasonable prices. Lance and his team are willing to customize an order how ever you like too. The ranchero and oriental salads are my go to, but the special buffalo wrap is amazing also.</Review>

Great cheese steak and an awesome salad (which is a weird thing for me to say). My wife, my son, and I all love this place for different reasons. Make sure to try their fresh, homemade strawberry lemonade!<//text>

Fantastic salads, sandwiches, and burgers! I've been a regular here for years, and dine here two or three times a week. Mostly outdoor seating; when the weather is nice (which is most of the time) this os the place to be! Oh, and breakfast options are good, too. Great coffee!</Review>

<review>Walked up to hear the chef/cashier and two others swearing at each other. Food came out cold.  There was towels on the floor cause there was leaking from a couple of containers.  The tables were dirty.  Over all not impressed with the presentation, the look inside, or the food.  My suggestion is look somewhere else<//review><username>Robert Burnie<//username><date>1529796081143<//date><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>1</rate><user_id>101554016870808960438</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Owner is so welcoming and friendly. I went with my family and friends and food was awesome! We ate tri-tip sandwich and quesadilla and both were so good. Fresh ingredients makes food taste so good. Their portion is very generous for the price :) Outdoor patio dining area was so breezy and nice. This part of town is very historic and vintage vibe to it. I love coming here time to time.<//review>

<Review>Cashier was abrupt and rude. The entrance was a mess and had to send my quesadilla back because it was cold and cheese was not melted. Tables outside were dirty.< /Review><time>1529796053400</time>< Gmap_id>

<text>Filthy restaurant call Kitchen Nightmares next time you're there look over the counter and look at their cutting board it is brown full of bacteriathe, baby high chairs are filthy and tables are filthy and so is the restaurant. Good luck I wish they weren't slobs.</text>< pictures>

Overrated Semi-Fast American food.  Nothing special... but somehow is very popular. Burgers are decent. No fries here, just chips...weird. Salads are a better choice.</Review>

Not much to recommend, food mediocre. Sauce poured in to container with no top, then put in to bag where it was not centered. Ended up at bottom of bag. Carne asada then dry and tasteless<//text>

Sireno, the owner/operator is super friendly and works fast.  Prices are great.  He'll look over your car asap and give you an out the door price on any exhaust repair or tires you need.  I will continue to go there and recommend his shop to friends and family.< /text>

I highly recommend this tire&muffler shop to anyone. Very low prices, professional and friendly service. I only waited an hour to get my mufflers installed. 5 star service all the way around!<//Review>

Love Village Fresh, always clean with helpful, friendly staff.  They actually bag your groceries and don't charge for the bag!  Meat selection is excellent and they have a cooked section that is impressive, tri tip burritos or sandwiches or whole cooked tri tip.  Chicken, teriyaki bowls, as well a vast variety or salads and pastas and cold sandwiches in deli.  Always fresh veggies and fruits as well as lots of yummy stuff from bakery.  They can get pricy but have good sales.  Milk is priced as low as they go when you buy 2 gallons. They sell Sees candy and lots if fun balloons and flowers.  Great ice cream selection and lots of hard to find speciality and local items.  Love my neighborhood Village Fresh!</Review>

If you are looking for a boujee l, overpriced, store look no further! You will probably pay $8 for a jar of peanut butter,  or $7 for of ice cream you can get LITTERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE for $4. Staff is friendly, store is clean, and organized, but very overpriced.<//review>

I went to Village Fresh after Party City told me they couldn’t fill balloons not purchased there because of the “helium shortage”. I’m SO GLAD I ended up at Village Fresh!! The employees were all so helpful and worked with me needing my balloons filled at a very reasonable price. Will definitely be coming back to support this awesome business!</Review>

<text>At one time the name was Richland Market, now its Village Fresh.  Best price on milk in town, as long as you buy 2 gallons.  Fantastic meats, and fresh produce.  However, the prices can be on the high end so if I have lots of shopping I usually skip here but for a quick few things like steaks and milk, this place is perfect.  They also specialize in hard to find items and locally made goods and wine.  Lots of organic items and a local, specialty dairy that bottles their milk in glass containers that you then return for the deposit.  Best strawberry and chocolate milk I ever tasted.  Other flavors like blueberry, banana, and various others as well.  Very clean, with knowledgeable, helpful staff.  Believe it or not they still bag your groceries here and will even help you out to your car!
Also feature a daily barbecue where you can put special orders in and have your meat done to your liking or grab a burrito on your lunch.  Also 2 daily fresh hot soups and many fresh items from bakery and deli.  Great seafood counter with lots of choices daily.  Fresh french bread daily and great sale prices on things every week.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x8091066af05fb895:0xf6b967f16487d5f3<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Always friendly. Perfect neighborhood market. They really do attempt to provide variety. Just keep in mind you cannot always get a particular flavor in the brand you want. Example: diced tomatoes. They carry 4 or 5 brands but Del Monte might be no salt added, Hunt's may be certain flavors, S & W will be other flavors, etc... so if you are looking for a particular flavor and have a brand preference it gets complicated. Today I am trying Muir Glen diced tomatoes with Italian herbs because I do not care for S & W or Western Family, I like salt so no Del Monte, and I needed this flavor. I must say we have found new favorites this way.<//Review>

< review>
Passing through Turlock I heard about Village Fresh Market from a local.  I also heard it was a bit expensive but the prices were as good or better than some other typical cheaper grocery markets for the items I purchased.  The first things I noticed upon entering were the fresh produce displays and shortly thereafter the friendly staff members.  I saw several staff members and each one seemed happy to be at work helping customers.  The lady in the deli was especially nice and helpful, patient while I decided on a salad, and then showing me free utensils, napkins, etc. when I told her I was traveling.  The aisles were roomy and labeled well and the facility was clean.  I found every item I was looking for and checkout was a breeze.</review>

Ordered food and was told to come back three times today and still didn't receive it. Terrible customer service. I've been a customer for years but won't return after today's treatment. Unbelievable.< /Text>

<Date>1512975416604<//Date><Rating>4< /Rating><review>Clean, with lots of specialty items.  Helpful, friendly staff.  Also, features 2 daily hot soups, a variety of deli sandwiches for lunch and almost daily there is a gentlemen in parking who barbeques any type of meat from butcher counter, cooked to your specifications, or grab something already done up and kept warm under heating lamps.  Also an array of deli salads to complete the meal.  However prices are on the expensive side.  Sometimes even sale items are more then normal prices elsewhere.  But they still bag your groceries and will even help you to your car with them.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>Whatever you do- just don't conduct business at Blue Banner Co Inc. in Riverside. The NEUROTIC owner is a stalker and has been reported for creating fake google accounts and using other people's usernames. The owner is committing identity theft posting fraudulent reviews posing as someone else as you can scroll and see... It's currently being investigated as well as the company. Very childish psycho LOL, very sad 😂 I will be warning everyone and reporting this to the Better Business Bureau as well)**  Thanks for the LAUGHS Blue Banner owner!!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Good people new changes! I know the wait sucks sometimes but if you're a driver with experience you should already know it's part of being a driver 😒 Unless they have VIP service expect to always have a wait time, your not the only one hauling 🚛🚛🚛< /text>

Moving pallets and rearranging loads is time-consuming causing delays for other trucks to be loaded and as we all know time is money."}<//Response>

Check in and get in the sleeper, it'll be a while unless you're the only truck there. They don't like having to move pallets for free, even if you've just got to rearrange your load because of pallet sizes.</text>

Nice clean bathroom with 2 stalls, both regular size. A decent snack selection and typical gas prices for this part of the trip. The clerk was super friendly and talked us into buying a lottery ticket.< /text>

<Text>Stopped here for gas and a tarp and was greeted by the nicest gas station clerk there must be. He assisted me with finding a tarp in the store then got bungie cords out of his truck along with a flashlight from his own stuff and gifted them to me then came outside in the nasty sideways rain and helped me tarp off my cargo in the bed of my truck and then continued to call to find a near by hotel room available for me so that i could safely rest after driving all night< /Text><GmapID>0x80bf842911ae979f:0x21b85eb59afb1ca7< /GmapID>< Pictures>

< Review>
I was walking from Oklahoma to California. This was the first store I came to after Stovepipe Wells. It was about 12AM Dec 22 2017 I think. They had HOT SOUP! AND CORNBREAD! OH MY LORDT! IT WAS SO AWESOME. I ate about four cups of soup and cornbread with hotsauce and some chocolate. I walked through town and ended up sleeping outside because the motel clerk was preoccupied 🙄. The store was well stocked though I didn't need anything but hot food that night. And OMG! THE BEANS AND HAM WAS PERFECT! CAN'T WAIT TO BRING MY SON THROUGH SOMETIME.<//Review>

This is an awesome pit stop on the way to Bishop and the mountains. They've got gas, clean bathrooms, snacks galore, a great Deli, liquor, and tons of stuff you might need. Employees were SUPER friendly and welcoming, and it felt like a corner store rather than a service/gas station.

Will definitely be back should we find ourselves in the area!</Review>

Can of Pringles, bottle of Starbucks coffee, bag of nuts, and Snappier came up to $17 & some change. I put some things back, and the Pringles taste funny, like they were exposed to something.

Asked who to talk to about it and she told me she couldn't tell me even a name. I spent $22 on a case of coke and two Gatorades and two candy so I also the prices are too high. I was told by my company to fuel there and I'm never going there again for food or fuel<//Review>< response>

Great price for name brand cologne! Staff was friendly and helpful. They pointed out some great values and made it very easy for me to get what I needed and get back on the road! I will definitely return for my cologne needs and future gifts for friends and family!<//Review>

The only reason I visit these places is to try new cologon. Then I look for best deals online. Unless you have extra money. Your choice</Text>

The worst
Literally the worst retail experience I've had in ages. Despite the huge July 4th sale crowds outside, the store was almost empty. No one asked if I needed anything, so I walked up to the counter and asked for a certain perfume by name. The unsmiling salesperson just said no. I described what kind of scent I wanted. She put a tiny drop of something on a piece of paper. It was nothing like what I described. She turned away and didn't say another word.<//text>

<review>A wide and spacious mall at the shopping center. I loved going there every weekend because the place was so peaceful and soothing. The people in this shopping center enjoyed walking around. You can't get lost here because you can ask for directions for customer service on each floor. They had a large food court as well.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>My encounter at the shopping mall was an exception. They've taken care of all my shopping needs, including clothing, shoes, furniture, and a restaurant.

The shopping center is such a beautiful location, with a fantastic environment, sleek architecture, and plenty of fun-filled events and activities to choose from. I appreciated a walk to the mall. It's been a well spent day shopping, movies, and food. I was captivated by a live music show at the mall.<//review>

Not crowded and everyone's practicing the safe distancing thing!] Never been here ona Monday and it feels like a weekend! Seagulls,  otters, and fish were out in full demand! The weather was perfect and sunny no wind or fog in sight. March is the perfect time to visit here!<//Review>

<text>This is very convienant shopping mall across from the Rui hotel when you walk in you sense's start to levitate towards the aromatic smell of food in the air. If you like Chinese food there's a restaurant inside that will fullfil your needs did catch the name to busy eating sorry😳 they also have a Subway sandwich deli inside for those who want to keep it semi-healty. I give them a 8 out of 10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐♥️🌹✨<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808580e4ca928577:0x19fec2a15d7cf531< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>The Service at this location is terrible and sub standard for the overall Safeway brand. On a recent visit I needed help at the Customer Service desk. After having to ask the sweet hard working female clerk sweeping up and emptying trash behind the checkstands 3 times to contact someone to help me..An employee showed up at the Customer Service desk...Only to tell Me he was clocking out for a break..I find it very, very hard to understand and believe that Safeway doesn't employ various individuals,  hopefully, completely competent to conduct business when another employee is on a break..Completely inexcusable as far as I'm concerned. The Marina Safeway in San Francisco is absolutely the best across the board.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>One of the most happening commercial circuits in SFO. Apart of shopping you can also find lots and lots of restaurants and there are so many activities happening around. So overall I highly recomm and to pay a visit and I am sure you will like it. For travellers there are number of good hotels around so you can find one of them near by.<//Text>< pics>

To me- It's like being in a magical place. You have NorthPoint Centre, which has many upscale shops and eateries, along with the farmers market. It's a great place to shop and eat. Dupars, has the best Chicken pot pie. I would recommend visiting this The Grove, at least once.< /Review>

A friend wanted to try this place. I wasn't particularly excited because I try to stay away from Asian food when eating out (already eat too much Asian at home). But wow, what a find. They have some very interesting dishes. And very reasonably priced. Would recommend if you're looking for something different.<//review>

They have a lot of different restaurants here. They have safeway here for a quick stop . They also serve the best soup around.
They also have other restaurants like subway, a Chinese restaurant and much more. This is a good spot for a quick lunch or to get something quickly near the wharf.< /review>

< Review>
As you guys know, I love sad malls and this one is no exception. The nostalgia is real. Even had some thin-railing'd stairs going to another floor but I didn't see where it went. Very clean as well, great atmosphere. Free wifi at Safeway with convenient bench to rest on. I'd recommend coming here for a quick trip back to the 90's. Even though I like calling old malls 'sad malls', this mall is anything but.<//Review>

After a hike around this city, I love stopping by here to buy a beverage and use the restroom.  This shopping area has a Safeway, Walgreens, Subway, and a Chinese restaurant.  Also very convenient to have a Wells Fargo bank in the Safeway as well.  I will always stop in here whenever I visit the Bay Area.</Review>

You can go workout in the 24 hour fitness at this location and then go do some shopping at Safeway and also get quick lunch at Subway or at the Chinese restaurant downstairs next to Safeway. They also offer validated 90 minute parking if you shop at Safeway or have membership at 24 Hour Fitness Center. Great location (near Fisherman's wharf).< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Think of Trader Joe's mixed with a bunch of open-walled restaurants, and you've got NorthPoint. Wines, cheeses, pre-cooked meals you can take home, vegetarian options galore, and a big open food bar where you pay ~$11 per pound, regardless of what you put in the box. I don't know about the rest of the day, but during the noon lunch hour it's so crowded that you can barely maneuver inside, especially if you have a backpack on.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Once inside you smell this wonderful smell; it's the Chinese food operation right there as you enter. I HAD to have some of whatever is making that wonderful smell. So I got some fried rice and gobbled it right on down my tubes. And, dam if it wasn't better than I imagined. Yummy I'm telling ya. Going back to the Safeway, which was my original intent. ...get another cup of that rice. Mmmm Mmmmm good, as the old add used to say. I'll let you all know how that dish goes. I'm expecting the best. Later folks.<//review><user>110861316318265953874< /user><Name>Paul Willis< /Name><Rating>3< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Such a fun place to go and shop! My family and I spent hours in this mall. We even went back the next day because we loved it so much. The mall is CLEAN and all the shops are ORGANIZED. They boutique were our favorite shops. All of the shop owners are nice. Marufuku ramen was hands down the best ramen I've ever had if you're looking for a restaurant! Definitely would go back if we took a trip back to San Francisco!</Text>

< Review>
The Safeway & the Walgreens are the only real standout of this shopping plaza. The tiny 24 hour fitness is barely worth a mention as is the Chinese ready to eat restaurant inside. There is supposed to be a Subway moving into the plaza but I have not seen it yet. There are always panhandlers on the parking garage (Mason St) & Bay St. side but not the  Powell Street, but the staff that work there do not seem to really care about them. The gem in the plaza is the smokeshop next to the bathrooms.</Review>

The 1980's called and want their shopping center back.  Other than the Safeway and Walgreens (and validated parking) there's not much reason to go here.< /Review>

It's whatever. Not much to see there and the bathroom situation is messed up.  We had to pretend to have interest in 24 hr fitness and sign liability waiver to use restroom facility.< /Text>

This is not a good place at all. It feels like a run down mall, with lots of homeless people and people begging outside. There is a Safeway but it seems like everytime I go in there to get something it's locked up, so I have to search for someone and then it takes forever to get it out of lockdown. The only time I come here is if I happen to need something from Walgreens, like distilled water. It's definitely not a good place to stop and use the restroom, as the homeless people use them for showers and they are disgusting. I feel bad for the people who have to work in such a bad environment. It's in one of the busiest parts of the city, and there is absolutely no effort to make it a good place to shop, eat, or rest for a minute for the tourists or the locals.</text>

<userid>118287670136949483715<//userid><text>I parked my Scooter in the garage met a friend for dinner at a nearby cafe then picked up a few items at Safeway It took about 3 hrs from 8:30 pm to 12. When I returned to my scooter the mirrors were missing the front panel had been forced open the ignition had been ripped apart and the posts on my battery were gone. While I was trying to put things back together and get it to start a security person walked by when I tried to talk to him about what had happened he laughed an shook his head and kept walking he refused to even speak with me. I looked around and couldnt see any security cameras in the area. I'll never park there again.<//text>< pictures>

The SUV next to me had it's back window smashed during a break-in. Lots of homeless. DON'T Use the hot soup counter in the Safeway it is a favourite of San Francisco's more streety characters.<//review>

Convient for neighbors and for tourists, but why keep so much space vacant?  The vacant store fronts are off-putting.  And the stores that are occupied care little for how their shops look from the mall.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This small mall is not that big, but there is a parking lot that is very convenient for customers. This small mall near the Fisherman’s Wharf at the end of Chinatown is very convenient for customers to shop and shop. Yes, ZanZanZanZanZanZan!

这座小商场不那么大，但是里面有很方便顾客的停车场。在唐人街尾靠近渔人码头的这座小商场，对顾客进店购物是带来百般的方便。不错，赞赞赞赞赞赞！<//Text>
