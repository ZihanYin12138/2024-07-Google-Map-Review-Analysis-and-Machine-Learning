My friend recommended this place for cheap burritos when I was in the area. I got the super burrito with steak and it was everything i wanted. A big burrito for cheap. Also came with tortilla chips which was awesome. I was full and that's what you will be if you buy one of their burritos. I was looking at the oysters and it looked really good too. I probably will come back some day for oysters.< /review>

The man on the register 95% of the time had a great personality in at least 2 languages and his partner on the grill produces the goods. Home made chips and killer salsa take it all over the top. Sometimes the tv is too loud screaming spanish TV with GOAL-GOAL-GOAL-GOAL- GOAL.. or Todo los dias.. AMORÉ!  Lol.
Next time you need a burrito or a quesadilla give em a shot.</review>< Pictures>

I WISH I COULD DO ZERO STARS.
Food was fine. However, if you eat here be sure to pay in cash because they commit credit card FRAUD!
Basically, my two tacos ended up costing me $40.00 because they decided it was okay to turn my 1 to a 4.
F*** these people.<//Review>

< review>
Ordered burrito and got charged for stake chips, whatever, but I took one bite of my burrito and I had to spit it into my napkin. I threw the whole thing in the garbage. I'm no foodie, I eat from food trucks, gas stations, and holes in the wall.... Also I'm what they call Gordo "fat"... So for me to throw $11 away worth of food is telling.

The issue: the smell of the food. I bit Into the burrito, and was hit a smell that I can describe as a mix of 3 day old roadkill with Petaluma manure smell from cow farms. I hate to be mean, but this is so far off from what I would expect to be sold from a business. For those who have had "gamey" meat, you may understand, it was a gamey smell that almost instantly made me convulse. I hope this was just a "bad day" and someone accidentally recycled unrefrigerated food or something... I cannot fathom how anyone who experienced what I got could ever return.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I paid $ 30 for 3 tacos and heaven mar y tirra, 3 caramels, a trosito de Carme and what a desir of the chicken, and what a desir of the service, VERY BAD. They don't even give you dribbles, until my children desian for the people who drink liquor, they serve them better, they come more regularly to ask if all is well and those who come fm not ...! The food tastes good but unfortunately I can only say that the quality of what they serve you is not worth paying for and the service is very bad, the owner has to see how they serve their clients and it would go much better.

Update: I’ve decided to get my dogs prescription at chewy.com because it’s $0.09 a tablet as opposed to $3 at the vet. But they were not responding to requests from chewy to ok the or forward the prescription so I called.
The woman at the office told me I had to bring Rudy in for a checkup to get the prescription, even though he was seen 4 times last year for the skin issue. They wanted $70 for the visit and addition fee for the doctor. I explained I’m a 72 yr old senior on a fixed income and in the middle of a pandemic. That the fee she’s asking is an extreme hardship, not to mention my fear of getting sick. I asked if there was possibly a senior discount, or a discount day. I was told that they do not offer any assistance “we are not a charity case” was her exact comment. I told her she was making me choose between getting groceries or paying for an unnecessary vet bill. I asked to have the vet call me, she told me I was no longer welcome there and the vet is very busy and would not call me. “Take your business elsewhere, we don’t want you here anymore” was what she told me.

I was in there a recently with my other dog and was shocked to see, in the midst of this health crisis, the place is still disgustingly filthy.

Original post: The Veteranarin is very sweet and seems caring but isn’t there often. Services are very basic I thought. Some staff are nice, others seem like they really couldn’t care less. Prices are very fair and they don’t push a lot of extras on you. THE PLACE IS FILTHY so I’m concerned about the filth I might not be able to see.</Review>

<Review>Every positive description applies. I was early Dawn helped right away and Becky (doggies name) whom usually growls melted into Dawns arms and was super relaxed right away.

The office was in thorough communication and delivered excellent service. Becky had a severe dental situation and she’s an older dog. This can be dangerous and has been stressful looking for the right place to take her. It was a massive relief to find the best team whom truly are dog people with out a question!!!

Thank you Cozycroft! ❤️ ♥️ ❤️</Review>< time>

<Text>we've been in the car an hour and a half! when I get here they tell me they cannot see me even though I called and said I was running late. Customer service not good! They also keep putting dogs on the ground in 100° degrees weather like their paws are not burning! Never again and not taking responsibility for telling me it was ok to come! If it was a problem they should have said it when I called to tell them I was running late! The worst front desk staff.< /Text>< GmapID>

Been taking my German Shepherd, my Basset Hound and my cat here for ages now- or at least it feels like that. Now I'm starting to take my new family member, a German Shorthaired Pointer puppy, for care and services here- office staff is friendly and Vets are knowledgeable and helpful- I appreciate their attention to my pets and don't ever see myself changing clinics- ever!!!</text>

<date>1573856755668<//date><Review>CozyCroft is amazing. I wouldn’t take my pets anywhere else. Dr. Hearther, you can tell, really cares about animals in general and as his patients. He’s not trying to make money off of your pet’s illness and is not going to order a bunch of unnecessary tests just to rack up your bill. He treats his patients as if they were his own pets and will give you his honest advice or option on a best course of action for your pet. The staff is incredible. Super warm and loving. Susie is the absolute BEST!!! She always goes out of her way to help in any way she can. Always stops to ask how you and your pet are doing. She literally remembers all of the patients that come through the door and is always reassuring and comforting when you and your pet need it the most. If you are looking for a new veterinarian, this is the place.<//Review>< user_name>

<Date>1567181009418</Date><Text>The best vet for all of our family pets since I was a little girl. The hours are short so call to confirm hours before visiting. We've taken several cats and dogs throughout the years and even a bunny. The staff is always friendly, helpful, and most of all honest about the care your pet needs and doesnt need. They won't try to sell you on costly procedures and they'll accommodate for your pets' needs like my dog that's a bit aggressive towards other dogs. They'll always take her in through the back so she doesn't get stressed about seeing so many dogs in one place.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c29c9dd1a2c499:0xed49a85e3896e47a<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Cozycroft Pet Hospital is one of the few places that treats reptiles in my area.  We have two adult male tortoises who sometimes get runny noses and need to be medicated. After examining them and sending home the necessary meds they back to their old selves in  no time. We're so grateful for Cozycroft!<//review>

<review>Love this place. I have been going here for over 15 years. Dr Harther is amazing. He straight forward but very kind and gentle. And the staff.... Can't say enough... They are all so very sweet.... Professionalism mixed with kindness and a pinch of humor. I don't trust my babies with anyone else.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
My daughter told me about Cozycroft,  and I brought my kitty there about 2 months ago. Although this is based on only my one visit, I really liked the place...I felt comfortable and felt like they really care about the animals, as opposed to only caring about how much money they can get out of the client, which is how I felt at the last place I went. And I found everyone working there very friendly and very caring with my cat. So, yes..I will go there again, and recommend them as the pet hospital to go to!< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Today I brought my 10 y.o. akita for a couple of shots.
This is a dog that wants nothing to do with a vet.
While he is a sweetheart in every respect he must be muzzled and restrained a bit when at the vet's.   I left him in the truck while I went in.   A tech asked me where I wanted it done.  I said.. "How about outside?"  I was very happily surprised when my dog paid little attention to the vet and everything was boringly uneventful.  I had to call some friends to tell them about this.   I'll be back to Cozycroft.  Whatever they did .. it worked.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

We have taken every pet we've owned to Cozycroft Pet Hospital for the last 14 years!  I will use no other vet!  I have never regretted putting my trust and faith in their ability to medically treat my animals as well as to care about them and nurture them while under their care.  Cozycroft has been there for us under happy and sad circumstances and have helped my family through it all at the same time.  They are the best!< /Text>

Dr. Harther has taken care of my dogs for close to 40 years. I moved away from Chatsworth and I still bring my dogs to CozyCroft. Excellent care and diagnostician. Very caring staff. I can’t say enough good things about Dr. Harther. I have taken my dogs to other vets on emergency basis and none compare to Dr. Harther. He is sweet and affectionate towards all pets.<//Review>

We've been taking our dog here for about a year. While they could stand to update their decor (it does look dingy and old), their prices and staff make up for it a little. You should call before you go as the vet only comes in during certain hours.<//text>

Came in about 830 on a Saturday for my dog. Checked in and told it would be just a little before I was seen. I was the only person there but figured no big deal. 45 minutes later I overhear them telling a caller the doctor doesn’t come in until 930.

Not sure why they wouldn’t tell me that and just keep me waiting. Not sure why they would open TWO HOURS before any animal can actually be treated!!< /text></record>

I have been here twice with my cat, and one time to pick up food. The doctor and staff are knowledgeable and kind. They put the animal needs and best interest first. He does not run any more tests than necessary at that time, and makes suggestions of what and when follow ups may be needed. You take the initiative to call for test results and future appointments. You don't actually have a set appointment. You call to found out the hours the doctor will be seeing patients and take your pet in. It is also a pet hospital, at other times he is doing procedures.
I've never had a long wait with a waiting room full of pets and people.</Review>

Had a friend recommended this place to me and it's where she takes her most prize possessions.  They took care of my little girl and the cost was amazingly low, felt guilty for how much they did and how little they charged... literally half the other price of other vets and threw hugs in for free!!<//Review>

I have been taking my pets here for 30+ years and I have friends who have been going here even longer.  The staff (most of whom have been there for 25+ years) are great.  Can't say enough about my vet!!< /Text>

UNFRIENDLY BUTCHERS.
Yeah. The chick at the front desk is very unfriendly and carries the attitude of someone who hates EVERYTHING about their job.

But it gets better!
Not!
Wow. Left half a hypodermic needle broken off in my dogs back after he was neutered. I can't IMAGINE just exactly HOW OR WHY you would or could BREAK A NEEDLE OFF IN MY DOG AND NOT EVEN CHECK!?!
After I pick my dog up from the clinic I notice he is acting very strange and I go to console him that evening and find.... lo! Pointed object protruding from his spinal area in a clump of blood! To which I had to get someone to help me pull it out and it didn't want to come out so that makes me wonder who STABBED MY DOG OR WHAT KIND OF BRUTAL CHOP SHOP ARE YOU GUYS RUNNING? (he weighs a whopping 19 lbs. btw)
I'm going to guess that the tranquilizers and anesthesia probably get used by the staff more than the animals.

My female who was spayed? Well it has been less than 24 hours and they've fallen out and so now we get to all head back to cozycroft chop shop to see exactly who was asleep at the operating table.

Maybe the ketamine and halothane not so much at work when performing surgery on man's best friends?

And this is where YOUR dog will go if they get picked up before you get them fixed. I guess it's OK THEN, to butcher them up when they're coming from doggie jail huh?

Seems like the American "blanket" mentality we use to justify all of the disaffected decisions that are brought on by the lack of morality and fortitude prevalent in the recent generation of youth that are so quick to thoughtlessly and carelessly avoid anything that involves commitment beyond "thy self"; i.e., the ego temporary. "Baah!"

I would, however, refer anyone wanting a frontal lobotomy and some special k to the folks at cozycroft.< /text>

< review>
My husband, myself, and our dog have been living at Avalon at Mission Bay's Phase III for almost 2 years now, and I wish we could stay longer. Due to work obligations however, we have to move out of state when our lease is up. Our experience has been wonderful! From the leasing staff, concierge, and maintenance. Cristine and Jai are one of my faves... always helpful when I have questions or concerns about our overall stay. Faye, Raymond, Chris, Ruben (I think that's how you spell his name), and Ben at the concierge are always helpful and fun to catch up with. I will really miss it here, and would definitely come back to live here again if there's an opportunity.

Thank You all so much for making our Avalon experience a very pleasant one!!! I will miss you guys! :D< /review>

Have been living here for a little less than a year already and absolutely loving here! I like its location - close to the bay, groceries, caltrain station etc, and renovated amenities, but what I like the most about the place is people - Raymond, the best leasing agent I have worked with ever, and Ben and Fei, the best staffs who make the place feel like home! I strongly recommend this place :)< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Had to drop my review from 4 stars to 1. I really loved this place for most of the first year I lived here. Coming on the end of my second year here the management really ruins this place. It's a shame because the staff are all amazing (Micelle Daly in particular really goes above and beyond) and really try their best to make this place welcoming and the unit itself is lovely. Management only shows up when they want you to renew your lease. Otherwise they're impossible to get ahold of. Our water has been randomly shut off 5 times within the past month and we've gotten no answer from them. Half of the time there's only one elevator working or available for a 19 floor building. A handful of residents flaunted covid rules throughout the pandemic and building management did nothing and said nothing about it. I'm just extremely disappointed because I had definitely expected to want to live here for longer but I'm definitely moving out now after this lease is up.<//text>< pictures>

I recently moved into Avalon at Mission Bay, and my entire experience throughout the apartment viewing, leasing, and moving process went very smoothly.

Alexa was our leasing agent and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking to lease here. She was very understanding of my needs, and was proactive in reaching out with units that were a good fit for me. When I did decide on a unit, all the paperwork was handled through Avalon’s online portal which was well designed and easy to use (I’ve had many bad experiences with past management portals). Alexa always made herself available to answer any questions I had along the way.

Apartment pros:
- Amenities include: a basketball court, ping pong, a rock climbing wall, a pool table, and 2 gyms (with class schedules)
- Friendly concierges who make an effort to get to know you
- Proximity to MUNI, Safeway, Lyft bike docks, Walgreens, Oracle Park

Cons:
- The rent is on the higher end, but I’d say it’s well worth it with the amenities and proximity to necessities
- A very safe neighborhood, but can get a little a little sketchy across King St at night< /review>

My boyfriend and I have been living at Avalon for over 6 months. Our experience has been great. Leasing Staff (Ray) and Concierge are always willing to respond to any questions. Maintenance is very responsive in a timely manner to fulfill any service request. Location is perfect. I would recommend Avalon.</review>

<review>The concierge staff at Avalon Mission Bay has been absolutely amazing - they are very responsive to messages and are quick to fulfill service requests. I've been so pleasantly surprised by the range of tasks they are willing to help out with, like replacing light bulbs and changing our stove. I would (and have been) highly recommend the apartment complex to anyone for its spacious modern layout and great services. All of the features of the apartment have been exactly as advertised, and I can rest assured that even if something does break, someone will help us fix it.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The front desk staff, Zam and Tanika, are absolutely amazing. They make sure you are safe and feel at home. Also, they always have a smile on and easy to get along with.

Don't rent during the pandemic! They are using predatory sales tactics during the market downturn which will result in you getting a worse deal than everyone else at other buildings. Read on for a short description why.

The fine print says the rent price during the lease includes two months free. This is to circumvent the sf rental pricing laws that prevent rental increases of more than 0.7% each year. This place will give you the advertised price for the lease term, and then leave you with a whopping 14% increase in rent at the end. Your rent will go up by $$$ hundreds when everyone else has theirs go up by less than $50.

One last gripe, I clicked "book a tour" on their website because I know exactly which unit I wanted to see, then arrived to find out I was sent a virtual tour link only minutes before, while I was driving there. They want you to book again and draw the process out.<//Text>

Avalon at Mission Bay North phase 1 is a great community I called home.  During this challenging times the team at Avalon cares and helps us make the best possible decision for our family.  Dog friendly community which is so nice!!! Also this community is safe, not perfect but we feel safe to walk the dog at night.
Raymond, our leasing agent, is amazing he cares about the residents and to give you all the options available.  The concierge team, Chris, Flo, Ben, and Luz are all about relationships and making us feel at home.  I can’t say enough about how comfortable living in Avalon feels, but the only thing it will be having A/C during the summer as with climate change San Francisco is getting hotter every year, LOL but other than that this building is safe and comfortable. Thank you, Avalon for providing us with a great place to live.</text>

I have lived here for two years and it is a good apartment.  It is Covid time now and the whole building is well protected. The Phase 2 staff, Sharon and Ben are amazing. They are nice, friendly, and patient. They always say Hi to you when you go by and are efficient when dealing with your delivery. The fitness center is also great and I used it a lot before Covid time.
The rent here might be a little expensive, but I think the apartment worth it.<//review>

I was a resident at Avalon Mission Bay for 4 years and can honestly say that most of my experiences far exceeded expectations. The staff at phase 3 were lovely (I enjoyed the daily interactions with Faye who was always kind & courteous, whether it was when helping to locate mail or check in on our well-being). The amenities, like the lounge, were kept in top condition but the gym lacked the size equipment that you'd often see in other places. Overall, I'd recommend living here if you need somewhere that's close to the CalTrain, doesn't have too many steep hills but still walking distance to the financial district.<//review>

The concierge is always willing to respond to any questions. Maintenance is very responsive promptly to fulfill any service request. I would recommend Avalon. Thank You all so much for making our Avalon experience an enjoyable one!!!</review>

I've been living in Avalon Phase 1 for 6 years now and have always had positive experiences with the building,  especially the front desk/concierge.  They are pretty much the best asset to the entire building because they are so friendly/warm and basically the first people I see in the morning and last people I see at night. Big shoutout to Mariane, Michelle,  and Flo - these ladies are so wonderful!</Review>

Pros:
-The front desk staff is terrific and always extremely helpful/kind (Especially Sharon, Ben, and Sabrina).
-The location is great and in a terrific location for runs/walks and the area in general is a great place to own a dog (2 dog parks super close by and Mission Creek Park)
-Maintenance comes pretty quickly once you put in a request

Cons:
-The shared utility bill is absolutely insane. From looking at other reviews, it seems like it's jumped like 4 or 5 times in price. It has been over $200 for "shared utilities" every month and when we reached out to understand what we're paying for, they redirected us to the utility company which said they didn't have any more information. This is in addition to our actual utilities which are over $100-$200 a month.
- The maintenance fixes are just bandaids and never actually fix the root problem. We've had them come to fix our toilets a few times and yet they're still always running (i've just given up). I've also had to have them fix our kitchen drawers multiple times because the bottoms keep falling out and they just glue them back in.

**Edit, after posting this Avalon called me and had maintenance come to fix the toilets the next day. They seem to be working now so I've upped my stars from 3-4.< /text>

Despite the negative experience, it’s worth mentioning management reached out to me directly upon finding out about my experience, and did what they could to make amends. I since updated my star rating from 1 to a 3 simply because it’s the right thing to do. When a company acknowledges they were wrong and takes action, it goes without saying that it’s appreciated. So thank you.

Original rating:
So I had really high hopes for Avalon. I heard nothing but good things based on the reviews. However, I’ll be completely honest and transparent. Today, I had a self guided tour scheduled. They never confirmed with a follow up with instructions  on where to go and where to park. Avalon Mission Bay is huge so a follow up with details would of been helpful. Secondly, when I finally received an email, it said I was scheduled for a “virtual tour”. Which was inaccurate. So I called several times over and got no help. So I finally made my way there and with the help of a tenant, I figured it out. When I arrive to the lobby, there like like 6 people there all getting their answers for future apartments, all clustered together. I finally got some help and the woman didn’t even bother to introduce herself. The first thing she did was say “Hi. How many bedrooms and What’s your budget?” Um, okay. Not cool. Secondly she goes on to hold a conversation with me in the lobby with tons of other potential residents. The whole thing was so informal. Then, she gives me keys for units that didn’t work. So I saw 1 out of the 3. The building looked dingy, construction going on and very lack luster. For all that money they’re charging, do yourself the favor and save it. Go elsewhere. They clearly care only about the money. Customer service is not a top priority.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I normally don't take the time to write reviews but I felt it necessary after the wonderful experience we had with Raymond. We are currently residents at the Avalon and are planning to move to a different apartment within Avalon Mission Bay and have worked with Ray for both moves. He graciously walked us through 2 tours, showing us various finishes and phases so we had a sense of what each available unit would look like. Given that we're staying within the Avalon family, he's helped us set up the perks for that and worked with us on move-in and move-out dates. I ask A LOT of questions and he has always promptly responded via email or made himself available via phone. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.

Additionally, I want to add that I live in Phase II now and absolutely LOVE the concierge. They are always so friendly and helpful. The service of all the staff here at Avalon is exceptional.

Update:
I had to update my review to include the Phase I concierge who are all SO INCREDIBLE! They've really made our time at Avalon really enjoyable especially through the pandemic. They're so accommodating, resourceful, and friendly! Thank you for making our time there so great!< /review>

Very confused with the poor level of responsiveness from the leasing agents. I've worked in housing, and understand agents tend to be on the younger side - even so - the poor responsiveness is reprehensible.

I've resorted to looking for contacts at the executive / ownership level for corrections here, the lack of responsiveness is just sad and it's my hope it that it does not reflect management.< /text>

I am a new resident at Avalon Mission Bay (Phase) III and I can't say enough good things about the concierge team and Fei Meng in particular.  Within the first couple of weeks, Fei knew my first name and made it a point to greet me and ask how everything was going.  To have that kind of sincere and personal exchange made me feel immediately at-home and welcome here.

The entire concierge team is professional, friendly and responsive, but because most of my public facing activity is in the evening, I cross paths more often with Fei.  She has the same kind of warm and personal approach with other residents and goes out of her way to help me with packages and/or deliveries.  Fei is truly a standout and is absolutely one of the best things about living in this community!</Text>

I would like to commend Fei Meng , is one of my favorites. She is always very happy, warm, friendly , welcoming and very helpful ...the ultimate resource for anything! She knows all of the residents by their first name and greets us whenever we come through.
She is mindful of the surroundings and always keeps us safe with Covid.
She is very reliable and follows through with any requests.
I always appreciate her for rescuing me from locking myself out of my apartment.
She makes living at Avalon Phase 3 feel like HOME!!!!

I also want  to give a shout out to my other favorite Concierge in Phase 3 in Faye Gomez. She is hard working and very helpful. She  is very mindful and helpful with delivered packages for the residents... I notice that many packages are delivered on her shift and I honestly don;'t know how she keeps them all straight, but she sure does every single time while still keeping the reception clean and orderly. She keeps us safe by adhering to Covid  restrictions. I work in health care and I really appreciate this very much. She is sweet and kind.. I appreciate her so much.

Many thanks to these 2 Ladies who make living in Avalon Phase 3 a place I can truly call home.

<text>I moved in Avalon at Mission Bay a couple days ago. My move-in experience has been very frustrating.

1. The apartment was not ready upon my move-in date. I initially signed a lease to move in on Oct 1st then I rescheduled my move-in date to Sept 30th after communicating and confirming with my agent.
- When I got to my unit with my movers an apartment maintenance team were still working on the unit (setting new blinds, cleaning dishwasher, etc) and they said I couldn't move in because the unit is not ready. I had to go back and forth between leasing office and my unit to accommodate a way to at least unload my furniture/boxes.
- Keys were not prepared so I had to keep my unit door open and ask frontdesk to open main entrance to the apartment until I got the keys.
- I realized after spending one night in the unit that the carpet was not cleaned at all. I was able to smell pet odor from carpet and I could see pet hair on the carpet (probably from previous tenant).

2. It's very difficult to get hold of anyone in leasing office. They sent leasing document required e-signature prior to my move-in and I paid a month worth rent (October) with security deposit then the same leasing document was sent after my move-in and asks to pay October's rent. I tried to call and email but I still haven't gotten any answer.

I know that many people had an amazing move-in experience with Avalon team but for me every steps from moving in to living here have not been smooth at all.<//text>< pictures>

I cannot say enough about how wonderful the concierge staff at Avalon Mission Bay is. They're very responsive, quick to follow up on requests and so eager to help when we encounter any issues. I especially want to recognize 3 of the very best - Fei Meng, Faye Gomez and Mariane Yambot! They are AWESOME. Each one deserves their own paragraph, but for the sake of being succinct, I'll just say that they are so warm, so genuine, so welcoming and so friendly. There's nothing like getting greeted by them every day. Literally each time we come in and out of the apartment, we always have such a great interaction (no matter time or day). Every time we've needed help, had questions, didn't know how to move in, asked for lost packages, needed to pick something up, etc etc, they've been there for us. They're true community builders and such good people. Fei, Faye and Mariane - thank you 3 for making this place feel like home! Appreciate you.< /Text>

<Text>I've been a resident for 2 years, overall I've had a good experience with Avalon but my lease was ending soon and I was considering switching to a different apartment complex to be closer to work. However, after talking with a leasing agent (Raymond Mitra) and looking at the other options within the complex, I decided to stay in Avalon. I want to say that Ray was fantastic! He has been incredible: he's extremely attentive, sending all sorts of virtual tours, videos, and information that helped me pick my new apartment (within Avalon). He has gone above and beyond with responsiveness, answering questions at all hours and honestly just extremely pleasant to work with. Having toured many places, the kind of service I received from Raymond was good enough to decide not to switch and continue my lease with Avalon. Also the basketball courts are a huge plus.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

My husband and I have been living in Avalon for three years now and we absolutely love it. We have lived in 2 out of the 3 phases and we recommend it to all of our friends! The location, building and amenities are all nice, but what makes it truly exceptional is the staff. They are absolutely the best - very friendly and always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that they deliver the best experience and make Avalon your permanent home. Maintenance is rarely needed but when it is, we just use the online ticket system and we're always impressed with how quickly things are addressed.

We are regularly greeted by this amazing staff and over the years have formed great relationships with them (shout out to Fei Meng who is absolutely the best..always so possitive and willing to help!!)

Thank you all for making us feel a part of a big family.<//text>

I moved into the Avalon Apt at Mission Bay without seeing the apartment itself and Ashley at the leasing office really went above and beyond to help me rent that specific apt while my roommate was out of the country. There were mishaps with city construction, parking, and heating during my move, but the concierge at Phase 1 were super helpful in working with me through all the obstacles. Thanks, guys!< /review>

This review is for Fei Meng, Community Concierge at Avalon Mission Bay III.
My family and I recently moved to Avalon, and Fei immediately made us feel at home.  She is professional, friendly, and accommodating.  She knows every resident by name, and acknowledges everyone she sees.  She is so good at her role, and Avalon is very lucky to have her part of the team.</review>

There’s a lot to love about Avalon Mission Bay including fantastic amenities (e.g. two gyms!) but the staff are by far the best part. They are just incredible — they are warm, friendly, and go above and beyond for me and my family. Alexa is such a joy to be around. She’s so warm and my baby adores her! Raymond is also so friendly, and helped us move within the building to the perfect apartment.< /Review>

I have lived in multiple apartment buildings in San Francisco and Avalon at Mission Bay has by far been the best place to reside. Where most apartments I sign a year lease and plan to leave as soon as the lease is over, I plan to live at Avalon as long as I can.
They provide 24/7 service with the most generous and caring staff. They provide coffee and tea every morning, and on the weekends they even provide bagels! They help receive AND return your packages. and they even open the door for you every time you enter or exit the building.
They do everything they can to truly make you feel safe, and feel at home.
Not only is there front desk service 5 star, but their facilities service is also beyond easy and QUICK. If you have any issue with anything in your apartment they will have someone out to fix it the same day, sometimes within a few hours. Paying rent and utilities is a breeze, there is trash shoot on every floor. PLUS you can't forget about the amazing gym. 10/10 would recommend</text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Avalon Mission Bay is a mixed bag. Their management office during the leasing and move-in process is hit or miss depending on who is helping you, but the concierges for my building are really nice and helpful, especially Fei whom I want to acknowledge as always being welcoming, extremely helpful and has a positive attitude when I come home. This would probably be a 3 star review if it wasn't for Fei.

Cons: mostly related to the rental scene in SF and costs just being high in general, although I think you get a good deal as long as you find a unit that's not facing Caltrain. Parking is much cheaper, if you negotiate, than other SF parking options which means this is a better deal than other comps if you're have a car. Utilities have tripled since the pandemic with no explanation. Still trying to get an answer but I hear it's because they split the entire building's expenses amongst the decreased number of tenants.

Pros: gym is open now, shared spaces are open, and with two months free this is probably the cheapest nice building near Caltrain in SF. Many of the units have bay views, it's a beautiful neighborhood to go for walks, and it's pretty quiet. Once you've moved in, the amazon hub lockers along with the friendly concierge team (Fei) make it so nice to have an Amazon addiction.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1605628824436, 'text': 'Hello Andy.

I have a great experience living in Avalon at Mission bay. I love how organized the management team are and how quick the maintenance requests are being processed. Besides those must-haves, there are lots of community building events as well, such as salsa, poker, message, Halloween trick or treat, etc. It makes me feel a sense of belongings and community even we didn’t know other tenants before. This is my second years living here. I would love to stay in this community in next few years!</Text>

<date>1603672311835< /date><review>So glad to be back at Avalon Mission Bay, in spite of the Pandemic! The location in SOMA is unbeatable - right next to 280 exit, in front of Caltrain, N and T Muni lines with beautiful China Basin right behind us. Safeway and Philz Coffee are across the street, Walgreens, UPs are just a block away! The amenities at Avalon meet their standards, we love the courtyard area with the gorgeous fireplace and snazzy grills with lounge seating. Ray at the leasing office is amazing and wonderful to work with, super professional and considerate. Ben at our concierge in Phase 2 has gone above and beyond to help us settle in so many times. All other leasing, concierge and maintenance staff are friendly and hardworking too. The Pandemic has put a strain on everyone so a little compassion goes a long way! :)<//review>< pictures>

Yet they refused to pay the credit after signing. Extremely slow response and would not honor concession even with multiple written email record. I'm getting a lawyer.

Every apartment complex has challenges, but I feel like Avalon at Mission Bay always tries to make it right. Minus the inescapable increases in rent, of course. I moved here with my boyfriend (now husband) because he enjoyed living at AVA 55 Ninth, another Avalon property, and the amenities and customer service were similarly excellent. Shout-out to Faye and Ben (concierge staff) for being so great at remembering residents. They always made me and my husky puppy feel like family. Overally, I'm grateful to call Avalon at Mission Bay our San Francisco home for three years!< /Review>

<Review>Been living at Avalon Mission Bay almost 2 years. Great place, great people, not a place that caters to long term living. If you want to re-sign a lease, they will try to increase your rent by 10+%. When you go to negotiate, they will make you feel special about dropping it down to the typical inflation rate of 1.8% on their fairest-price, a 10 month lease. I want to keep living here, but it is hard to live on a 10 month agreement with no loyalty from the landlord. I would suggest they find a new way to appeal to more long-term customers< /Review></record>

Pros:
Friendly & responsible concierge and service team!  Nice views from the upper floors.  Good variety of amenities - club room, gyms, ping pong, climbing wall.

Cons:
Expensive.  Amenities are decent, but not in tip top shape.  For example, gym equipment is fixed slowly, phase 3 lobby is a little shabby, some of the doors require an extra tug to open, the football table is missing players.

Overall:
We’ve been living here 2 years and really like our apartment.  As long as the rent increases are manageable we plan to stay.< /Review>

We stayed at Avalon for a total of 8 years in Phase 1 and then Phase 3.
The proximity to Caltrain, muni, buses, Safeway, freeway, kids playground, etc. is hard to beat. We really enjoyed the free workout classes for residents.

The staff was really nice and supportive. We especially loved Faye in Phase 3! She is responsible, knowledgeable and above all really warm and welcoming. It was tough to say goodbye to her, the rest of the Avalon crew and the workout classes after such a great stint.

Thank you Avalon.< /Text>

<review>I moved to Avalon about 2 years ago and it truly is one of the better decisions I have made in my life. The quality of apartments, amenities, safety features, community events, prime location etc compares to no one in all of San Francisco. A big shout out to David from the leasing office who made my moving in experience painless and smooth. He provided an exceptional tour of the place, took care of all the paperwork and also assisted me with the move in process, all while having a cheerful smile on his face. Thank you David for making my overall experience at Avalon a remarkable one.

Location - really awesome with all transportation options nearby as well as the Caltrain
Facilities - Love the lounge in Phase 1. The gym is well equipped, the machines are not the newest but it’s pretty big and you can always get space

Alexa, Christian, Benjamin and Shanon are my favorite people from Avalon Team, they are always so friendly, smiling around and very eager to help. Avalon is also a great place to live, is a clean community, they have a lot of activities during the year for the residents. The location is perfect, one block from Safeway, two blocks from Oracle Park and many transportation options around of the area. This is my second year living here and I hope to stay one more year.</Review>

The reason I deducted one star is due to the trash disposal condition. The elevator we use is very close to the garbage area and it stinks. Other than that we really like it here. We will probably not renew due to the upcoming rent increase. If you can afford it, the location and apartment is great.</review>< pictures>

The people here are amazing.  In particular, David Bejarano has been an outstanding Community Consultant.  I have had open dialogue with David regarding my community experiences and he has always been open to listening and fast to act in addressing any of my questions or concerns.  He is definitely a valuable member of the Avalon community and has helped make my experience remarkable.

Another outstanding member of the Avalon community is Chris Orosco.  He is a person of solutions and understanding.  He is very patient, thoughtful and truly works with residents to ensure a positive experience.  I can certainly say that my tenure here would not be the same without him.</review>

It's a great community to live in - new with good amenities and in a great neighborhood.

One star is subtracted for some irresponsive and incompetent office staff (don't want to name him/them here). They are incapable of effective communication and you'll always have to send several emails before finally receive a reply from them, even to correct a mistake they previously made. Front desk/technicians are awesome though.<//review>

< Review>
We loved our time here.  We had a Studio on the 18th floor of Phase 3 with a beautiful view of the bay and the Giants stadium.  The staff is friendly, and access to 280 South is really easy.  My only issue is the ventilation of the apartment.  There are only 2 small windows that open.  They are on the same wall, so there is no chance for cross breeze.  The apartment is on the leeward side of the building, so no natural breeze, and no AC.  We stuck 2 small fans that fit in the windows, but still the apartment was really warm during the relatively cool summer. The heatwaves we had made it almost unbearable.  The place is expensive, but so is the rest of the area, so I feel it's in line with the rest of the apartments.  This place is worth looking at.  They are very flexible with lease terms and pet friendly, which was a big selling point for us.<//Review>

TLDR: You get what you pay for.

I've been living in Phase 1 since June. I have 0 complaints except for the elevators breaking constantly. Note: I don't believe this happens in the other phases/buildings. And when it continued to happen, they rewarded residents with a little "party" of the sorts. So usually if something goes wrong, they try to make up for it in some way. Other than that, really no complaints. It's very convenient. Can be loud sometimes. I would recommend for those who are transplanting to SF to consider living here so you can get the true "city" experience. If you have lived in SF before or currently live here, it might not be the best experience because it is on the more-expensive side compared to other complexes.< /Review>

The amenities are second to none, it is steps away from the Caltrain (for those working in the South Bay), and it’s close to a myriad of restaurants and bars. The apartments are also bigger and newer than other nearby complexes. We were looking at 5 different apartment complexes, but so glad we chose Avalon! Keep up the great work!</Text><date>1573070372425<//date></record>

<Text>Have been searching for an apartment for a few months. Rommel in the Avalon leasing staff has been incredible. He showed us around multiple units, and maintained regular correspondence over email for several weeks while we were looking at units. He's really gone above and beyond as a leasing agent, if I didn't decide to move out of Soma for personal reasons I definitely would have rented from Avalon compared to the other complexes in the area because of him. Thanks Rommel for all the help!!<//Text></record>

Moving in to Avalon has been an easy transition - not only are the facilities great, but the location is ideal for commuting via Caltrain. We had scheduled to tour several places, but applied for a place on the spot once we toured Avalon. Raymond has been extremely responsive to our questions and even pushed back our move in date so that we could move in later, which we fully appreciated.<//review>

I’m on the fourth floor and we can hear the basketball court all day long!!!! I constantly hear basketballs dribbling and the basketball hitting the headboard all day long. Starting at 8am and going until 10pm. My room shakes and the noise is SO LOUD all through the entire apartment!

I’ve emailed the front desk about this and they claim they’ve rarely received complaints about this and they make sure the basketball court is shut down by 10pm BUT THIS DOES NOTHING FOR US.

It drives us insane and I wish they were more transparent about this. Thank god we only have 4 months here.

If you ever rent a unit here or check one out, make sure to speak with previous tenants and neighbors and do your due diligence!< /Text>< gmap_id>

I've lived here 5+ years and if I could buy the place - I would! I love my apartment so much. The building is very well maintained and the staff goes above and beyond. The staff is really what seals the deal with tenant retention IMO. The location is ideal, right by Safeway, Muni, sports stadiums, restaurants, bars. The only downside to living here is the homelessness - but that's a broader SF issue and not Avalon. I'd have to move to a suburb to escape it. I really love my place and hope that whenever I have to move, I can be just as happy as I am here.</text>

< Review>
My husband and I recently moved to the property and we’ve had an excellent experience so far.
The leasing office staff have been very easy to work with. We submitted our application for residency in the morning and requested to move in the evening of the same day. The staff responsiveness was outstanding – they went above and beyond to resolve all administrative obstacles that would’ve prevented us from moving in at the requested time. We have an electric car and during our move-in orientation we requested to be assigned a parking spot with a charging port if possible. Yesterday at 7:16 pm – 45 minutes past the office closing time, we received an email from Raymond stating that he found a spot for us with charging in our building.

We are more than pleased with the experience - especially with Raymond’s assistance. Avalon at Mission Bat is lucky to have him as part of the staff.< /Review>

You can hop on the 280 freeway in an instant if you need to drive down South!  Also across the street there is a path along the water where you can walk your dog or relax on a bench.<//Review>< time>

I've lived at the Avalon for five of the past six years, and I don't think I'd enjoy living anywhere else nearly as much. What attracted me to the place is the quality of the apartments, but what's made me stay is the quality of the staff. They're just really good people who help me when I need it, quickly address the very few problems I've had and are always so friendly whenever I see them. Highly recommend!<//Review>

Alexa showed me 5 different apt's in 3 different buildings and all of the amenities in each. She was very knowledgeable and knew the in's & out's of all of the units, pricing, utilities and made me feel comfortable applying on the spot. I had looked at, at least 5 different apartment complexes in the area, but Alexa guided me towards things she thought I would love, and she was right. She stayed 1.5 hours past closing time to help with my application and I never felt pressured at all. I slept great my first night here.</Review>

Staff is extremely friendly and courtesy. There is no hesitation if you ever need help and maintenance requests are completed in a timely manner. The complex has great amenities. They offer daily work out classes, bring in food trucks, host community events almost monthly, provide baseball tickets, and Saturday bagels. Very pet friendly community. Only downside is cost is a little pricey and you seemed to get charged for everything, but I understand this is the city. Overall great community to be a part of.<//Review>

I've been living at Avalon Mission Bay for about 2 years, and it's been fantastic. The building is fairly new, management is extremely responsive, concierge service is very nice, and there are many different apartments to choose from depending on your needs.

<Review>Great place to live with excellent staff and service. Highly recommend. Very convenient with many Muni lines and easy access to SFO and all points south. One negative is that they only clean the windows once per year. I understand it is expensive but the north facing (close to CalTrain) need to be done multiple times per year due to buildup from the diesel exhaust.<//Review>< Time>

It's a very nice location with great amenities, including a relatively good apartment gym and fitness classes. The concierges are all friendly, and the building is well-maintained and has a rooftop lounge.< /Text>

<Review>Long overdue review of why this place is my home: The people make the difference at Avalon.

I've lived at Avalon for seven years and in that time I've had people who work here go far beyond the call of duty. When I had knee surgery and could not walk, Chris at the concierge desk came up to my apartment with my large UPS packages and helped open the boxes and removed the recycling for me. When the outdoor air quality was so dangerous that the dog owners in the building could not exercise their pets outside, the leasing office team coordinated "dog play time" in the basketball court a couple of hours a day. When a friend who also lived in the building had a couple too many glasses of wine Luz at the concierge desk helped me get her home to her apartment safely.  So, while I enjoy the amenities, convenient location and speedy response from the maintenance team, what really makes Avalon my home is smiling faces of the people who work here and are always around to lend a hand and make residents lives a little bit easier.

UPDATE: The same day I wrote this review I saw Ben from the concierge desk carrying another resident's groceries home because she has a broken arm. There are a lot of buildings in the area and everyone is competing on amenities but at the end of the day I'll take people like Chris, Luz and Ben over "things" any day of the week.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< gmapID>

My wife and I have been living in Avalon for over a year and a half now and we absolutely love it. We recommend it to all of our friends! The location, building and amenities are all nice, but what makes it truly exceptional is the staff. They are absolutely the best - very friendly and always willing to go above and beyond to make sure that they deliver the best experience and make Avalon your permanent home. Maintenance is rarely needed but when it is, we just use the online ticket system and we're always impressed with how quickly things are addressed. There are also regular community events and perks that keep things fresh and genuinely make you excited to come home. Special shoutout to David Bejarano in leasing who went out of his way to help us find the perfect apartment and has made the process smooth and easy for us since the beginning. We tend to ask a lot of questions and his transparency and authenticity throughout the entire process has made working with him an absolute pleasure. Thank you all for making us feel a part of a big family.< /text>

I am a current resident of Avalon Mission Bay. We've lived here for the past 3 years. The location is perfect for anyone commuting out of the city, to SOMA, or FiDi. Their employees are incredibly friendly and very helpful. My favorite features are the onsite gym and washer / dryer in unit. Avalon is also very dog friendly. I would recommend this apartment complex.<//review>

Place is awesome. I've lived at a a few buildings, Avalon is great (the best). Customer service is awesome, they have a 24 hour concierge. Mailing in and out is SO easy. It's the small things. They have coffee and dog treats out . The front desk knows everyone by name (idk how, its wild). The amenities are amazing. Things go wrong sometimes in the apartment, this is normal - it's how they deal with these issues that separates them. They come and fix whatever is wrong in 24 hours. My biggest issue with this place is I wait for the elevator sometimes for too long... lol. It's true and it's a little frustrating, but come on (way too spoiled). I like the other residents too, everyone is polite and nice.<//Text>

Long time reader, first time reviewer.

Have lived in Avalon apartments on and off for about three years. The staff over the last several months has gone from attentive, friendly, and helpful to MIA and unresponsive. Additionally, tenants seem to consider public/shared spaces as their own personal living rooms, frequently trashing common areas, playing beer pong for hours, and listening to loud music. Despite multiple tenants reporting dissatisfaction with this behavior on a regular basis, management is unresponsive, having done nothing to address the issue, and they are conveniently away from the building when it's happening. This place used to be a nice, upscale apartment complex. It's degenerated into a frat house. If you want to listen to kids partying all the time, this place is for you.</Text>

<text>Avalon at Mission Bay is located in an ideal part of SF. It is walk-able to department stores, restaurants, bars, and the baseball park. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Nic, the leasing agent, was very knowledgeable, accommodating, and made the whole move-in process painless. Internet/TV installation via AT&T was painless and the people I worked with (Joseph, Kenny, and Vincent) were all professional and great! Joseph was accommodating with my move-in availability time.< /text>< Date>

<Review>I can honestly say that I am very glad and fortunate to call Avalon @ Mission Bay my home for the last few years. The facilities and amenities are amazing but most importantly so is the staff. They go above and beyond to ensure that your needs are accommodated. From the lovely concierge staff (we love you Merry) to the knowledgeable community consulting staff, they have really made it easy for my wife and I (and our bully meatball) to enjoy our home when outside of the stressful work environment. Cristine Rodriguez has helped tremendously and exceeded our expectations when it was time to renew our lease. I really appreciate her and look forward to resigning again.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I lived here, in phase 3, for 4 years, and recently moved out not because of this complex, but because I no longer liked San Francisco.

For the location, size, and amenities, this place was a remarkable deal. Like most Avalon communities, the initial price is relatively low then they raise the rent by high amounts, but with negotiation this is kept to reasonable rent increases that reflect the market. AT&T fiber is available in phase 3, without a data cap.

The concierge team is all star. They're super kind and helpful, and they got to know me by name pretty quickly.

I had an apartment facing the courtyard, and rarely heard the trains. Fourth and King St is a big transportation hub with the Caltrain station, so relative to bay area transit it is fast, though expect regular, major bus/tram delays. With the freeway right next door, exiting the city by car is super easy and there's zipcars you can use to do so.

The downsides of this complex are all pretty much that it's in San Francisco, though the neighborhood is, for San Francisco, very nice. As with all of SF, lots of homeless, and human urine and feces to dodge every time you walk outside. Lots of solicitors, both political (in those seasons) and religious, will bother you if you stand outside too long. Severe understaffing meaning quality of services goes drastically down (expect to visit concierge or contact maintenance a second time occasionally for the same task). Were this rating not relative to San Francisco, I'd give this place 2/5 stars.

Move out was very smooth. I did move to another Avalon, so that and my long stay may have factored in, but they offered a cheap move-out cleaning service, and did not charge me for painting the walls or replacing the carpets (sadly, had pet damage on each). I received, less the cleaning service fees I opted into, my full security deposit back, without any hassle.

<review>Members of our family members have lived at Avalon Mission Bay North for 3+ years.  The facilities are beautiful, safe and clean, but the real magic of the place is the staff they have in place.  Javier's maintenance crew is remarkably responsive to even the simplest needs, which is amazing given the number of people they need to serve.  The concierge team is excellent so it's completely unfair to single out anyone in particular, but our family's personal experiences with Merry and Raymond have been wonderful.  It is a great place to call home.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808f7fd6dd702f27:0xb55a40a334590773< /gmap_id></record>

We had a flood due to a freak accident related to the washer dryer.  What would otherwise have been an absolute disaster was saved by David Bejarano and team.  They went above and beyond to get us a same-day move within the building (up one floor).  Best part about it is that we like the new apartment better!< /review>

We just moved in a few days ago, and so far everything has been fantastic. Nicky is very nice and accomodating, she guided us in finding the right apartment and helped us to have a smooth move-in. Nick from the leasing office is always ready to help too.
The unit was in a good condition at the check-in: clean, fresh painted and with a new carpet. Our apartment has great views, and is very spacious and light (I love it!). The only con is the noise from the street traffic and trains, but this is normal when you live in the city.
The Avalon staff are all very friendly and the location and amenities are great!</text>

I haven't lived in Avalon at Mission Bay (hopefully soon), but the staff is welcoming. We leave in another Avalon community and have head great experience, now trying to move here and the customer treatment doesn't disappoint here either. It must be that all Avalons are great. And Jason here is amazing, he doesn't answer your questions to get rid of you, he tries to think of things that you may have missed to ask, or may be important to you, he was so helpful! Will rate again once/if we move in.<//review>

we just move out and we are going to miss it!

First and foremost the maintenance team is amazing, they were quick to respond and kept the place nice.

Jason and his team found my wife and I the perfect apartment. we had concerns about the noise being on the city side but had no issues...actually the view was so nice we didn't notice anything else.

Michelle and Cristine kept us informed and entertained with info and activities all the time.

Faye and Ben were our concierge and quickly made us feel at home. They helped with packages and always had coffee and bagels in the morning.

We moved from a more "downtown" apartment and was concerned it wouldn't feel urban enough but we were wrong, we felt downtown but without the traffic...sooo nice!

a special thanks to Kayla whom assisted with our inspection and move out. Kayla you are missed!!</Text>

I lived in Avalon for a 10 month lease this past year. My largest complaint was around re-signing for a longer lease. They were bumping our rent for the same apartment by $250 per month. I would have been okay with this (somewhat) if it weren't for the fact that the apartment ended up going on the market for LESS than they were offering us. I would think it's in their best interest to keep the same tenants + consistency of residents as opposed to frequent turnover.  Aside from this unique lease situation, overall it's a good/safe area to live-in, especially if you take the Caltrain for work or love going to baseball games. We would be able to walk out of the apartment ten minutes before the first pitch and make it into the game. However, other than baseball season, there are much more lively areas of the city than Mission Bay with more restaurants + bars + happenings on a nightly basis (especially for the expensive rent you are paying to live here, you could live elsewhere with more to do for around the same price).  You are right across the street from a Safeway and approx. 10 min walk from nearby Whole Foods.....about 20 minutes from Market + Metreon + Target.  Overall good experience, but have enjoyed living elsewhere in the city.<//text>

<text>My wife, our daughter, and I have been living in Phase III for the past 9 months while our house was being remodeled. We are moving out this weekend and wanted to drop a note to share how incredible our experience with Britney has been during this time.

While all the staff members have generally been positive and professional, Britney stands out heads and shoulders above anyone.  She has consistently gone above and beyond without ever being asked to make us feel welcome, supported, and always satisfied. As just one example, when our Instacart shopper got lost in the apartment complex with some much needed groceries (including milk for our daughter), she walked them over personally because she knew that had happened once before and had been challenging for us to resolve.

She is always positive and personable and has always found ways to make every interaction a pleasant, regardless of the issue.  Even when we weren't at our best, Britney always was. She exemplifies positive customer service as a concierge.

We will miss Britney a lot, she was one of the fixtures duriing our time here and I am sure she is for many other residents. I just wanted to ensure she was recognized by management through us as residents, we would not have been nearly as happy here at Avalon during our stay without Britney.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Easily the most heartless people I have ever met. I was moving out and the concierge reassured me that I could keep my luggage in the "moving room" . 2 weeks later coming back from Colorado I came back to collect my stuff. The young lady at the front said it wasn't in the room & I would have to talk to the manager who wasn't on duty. It took me days to reach someone. I was informed my belongings were thrown away and not only did they discarded my belongings they went through my bags and took out my medicine she said they're not a storage facility. The original person that brought my bags to the storage room made it sound like my things would be safe. I literally had everything of my in there except my backpack I brought to Colorado. The front desk doesn't care nor would ever put themselves in my shoes they're so stuck up and rude. I lost my social security , license, pictures& letters of my father that passed away & meant the world to me& lots of clothes but those can be replaced. This placed ruined my life for a bit but they will never have any idea. If you are considering living here don't, they don't care about you they will put a front until you leave then you will see their true colors.</Text>< user>

<rating>3</rating><review>I've been living in phase I since late 2018, the newly renovated lounge at 19th floor opened last year around Christmas.
Something you should know about the lounge:
(1) at night, all the light will be turned off automatically unless you keep walking. I was trying to get some work done, and every 5-6 minutes or so I will have to get up and walk to certain spot so that the lights are back on. I saw tenants working on their laptops at the dark.
(2) temperature in the little conference room is always freezing, unless it's noon and it's a really good day.
(3) no one(front desk, manager) knows how to use the printer in the conference room I was informed they didn't get trained for it.
(4) always booked/occupied by large loud parties at Saturday.
Pros:
lounge view is okay at day and pretty at night.
free wifi
TV

Re-edit:
The staff has remedied the situation on the lounge, now
(2) the conference room warm and cozy. The light in conference room won't go off automatically at night, not sure about the light of the main area of the lounge.
(3) I heard staff have been trained to use the printer too
(4) Yesterday (Friday) I was there at night, party goes very loud from 8pm to 11:15pm then they moved into the conference room.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1548768276503, 'text': "Ruxue, I certainly understand how you would come away from that situation feeling stressed and frustrated, and I'm sorry we had a hand in causing those feelings.

You won't regret choosing Avalon at Mission Bay! This is now my second time living here, and I'm extremely happy. Let me break down why I like Avalon:

Leasing Staff: These are some of the nicest people you'll meet. They care about the building and the tenants, and it shows. Both Jason and Raymond helped me tremendously. Drop by and say "hi" to them.

Front Desk: I'm in phase 1, and the front desk staff are always very polite and courteous. Very different from MANY buildings. Usually, they are even remotely opening the lobby door before I enter or leave. They are extremely attentive and have always been happy to help with anything I've needed. They also receive packages and notify residents by email within minutes of arrival.

Location: 255 King Street is one of the most convenient locations in all of San Francisco. Within a single block there's the Cal Train, Muni, Safeway, Starbucks, Philz coffee, the library, AT&T Park, a pet store, and several restaurants.

The Apartment: Each unit differs, but mine has a great layout and TONS of light. I currently work from home, so a motivational environment is a must. I love my apartment here.

Amenities:  Avalon has many amenities such as a gym, lounge and work areas, and 24 hour concierge.The best amenity is location, and the community generally consists of polite techies.< /review>

<Text>STAY AWAY from this community. I've lived in different Avalon properties for almost 4 years now and truly thought of myself as a loyal customer (and in fact, recommended this place to several people). However, given the very ugly experience we are having with the move-out now truly shows their true colors, which is just to get as much money out of you as possible. They go through all these great 'guarantees' just to get you to sign the lease and once you are an existing resident with a contract, they get away with anything they want. For one, they significantly increase your rent after 12 months, but I guess that is just the insanity of SF. However, we needed to break our lease early due to personal circumstance and they assured us that they will work with us (aw, how sweet!). Thankfully, another resident took over our lease and our apartment was in the position to being transferred to the new tenant. Five days before our move-out, Avalon tells us that the new tenant changed their mind and will be taking another apartment. WTF?! I've been trying to find some middle ground with CJ, the head on-property manager, because we are completely screwed. We took our apartment off the market for 3 weeks because they told us they have the new tenant. We stopped our own search for a new tenant. And now that we are about to move out (literally, place is covered in boxes) they are slapping us with the full penalty for breaking the lease. They wont even put new tenant's deposit toward any help for our situation, in spite of the fact that they completely screwed us over. I am telling you, they are all nice and sweet in the process (and granted, the front desk and maintenance people are lovely) but when it comes to anything having to do with their leasing office / customer service, they treat you like a money-making machine and just a number. Stay away if you want anything more humane and much more professional treatment and learn from our VERY unfortunate experience.<//Text>< UserId.>

I've lived in Avalon for a little under 8 months and it has been a phenomenal experience. The amenities and staff are absolutely amazing. My leasing agent, Cristine R, ensured we received the perfect apartment and it has been smooth sailing since then. The concierges, including Brittany and Phey, are exceptional and constantly ensure our daily needs are met. Overall, I would recommend Avalon for anyone seeking an apartment in SF.</review>

Cristine, the community consultant is very helpful and responsive! They helped us get screens for our windows. The team also sends out frequent surveys regarding fitness offerings and the common spaces and takes pretty fast action to make improvements and get things resolved!</Text>

Time to update our wonderful review and thanks to Faye.  She is our day concierge in Phase 3 Avalon Mission Bay working to keep our building running smoothly and this year Covid was added to all of our lives!!! We start our day with her smiling face now behind a mask, and during these trying times it means so much to all that live and work here.  Thank you Faye!   We often see her helping whoever is in front of her desk, with a willingness to assist while  keeping all of our safety first too!   So thank you Faye as we continue living here with you at the helm.!

With the time change I am also reminded how wonderful afternoon Fei is too!  She is always so quick to jump up and assist anyone who approaches the desk. She too has made the Covid safety measures a priority to keep all healthy here.   I personally like someone being at the desk for my evening walks going in and out of the building at night in Covid times and Fei is a delight!  We feel so lucky to have been here for 5 years with such wonderful concierge people.  Thank you afternoon Fei and here's to all of us having a great and healthy year 2021.</text>

I'm sooo disappointed. I just leave the lobby in this minute. I arrived here at 12:45 for look at the building and talk about leasing. The receptionist told me I should wait because everybody is out for lunch. But it's 13:20 now and still nobody here.<//Review>

Our leasing agent was David Bejarano and words cannot describe how amazing he is! So obviously, I highly recommend him to be your leasing agent at Avalon:)

In regards to finding an apartment, we gave David a general idea of what we were looking for (e.g. a study space, area for our dog, upgraded appliances, view of the city, and of course price) and he presented us with multiple viable options. In touring these options, he was very upfront and honest about all the pros and cons per each apartment. We made our apartment decision and couldn't be happier.

In addition, to helping us find our happy home David also continues to check up on us to make sure that we’re happy. Not only have we found a place to live, we found a home and community that we love.

Thank you David!<//review>< Pics>

I love Avalon! I've been here for over 2 years and we don't want to leave.  Cristine the community consultant is so helpful and responsive! She's so accommodating!  The concierge team is also awesome! Jai, Faye, Merry, Romuel, Brittany and Christian have all some way contributed to my great experience at Avalon. It's great that the concierge team are so aligned with the leasing office to provide a fun and safe community for the residents.< /Review>

Jai, thank you for all you do to make the building such a great place. With all the competition for top-notch concierges in this and competitor buildings, you've got a challenging job. Your commitment to service and to caring for the people who live here - you treat them like your own family -- always comes across. In fact, there have been times in our four years here when you've been the most consistent and caring face of customer service. Thank you for that! You know how to be fully present with each and every tenant, and you focus on the solution, rather than get mired in the problem - a true professional all the way. You will certainly be missed. We still speak fondly of the times when you were a concierge and staffed the front desk at phase I. You have an energy and warmth that came across then and always comes across when we run into you.< /Text>

Bad room layout. Giant poll in the living room, electricity sockets where you can't hide,  Tv sockets where you don't need them, no cooling system, heater vent is at a weird place where you would usually want to put furniture. Floor carpets with nails sticking out.
AC on 1st floor and common room on 19th floor shares controller. So when it's fine on 1st floor, freezing or hot on 19th floor.
Light bulbs are never changed outside.
Nice location though. Nice view, Safeway right in front, Muni K & N line right in front, Caltrain station right in front, some good restaurants in back streets. But lots of homeless people, shouting day and night.
Concierge guys are usually really nice. They kinda compensate for the other flaws.< /Review>

All things considered, it's a decent apartment for San Francisco. The public and shared areas are generally clean. When something breaks, it's usually repaired within a few days.

Our biggest complaint are the carpet and the pest problem. Our carpet had been deep cleaned when we moved in, but it's old and needs replacing. In addition, mice have plagued our apartment for the last 6 months. The office has provided little sympathy, and done virtually nothing to resolve the problem.</text>

<Review>The only real complaint I think you can have about this place is that it's expensive, but most of SOMA is expensive at this point. Realistically, too, this location as amazing. We had a good time when we were living here, but surprisingly, the thing we'll probably miss the most is the wonderful concierges at Phase 2. Kim, Kat, and Julia, especially, were attentive, friendly, received packages, helped arrange move in/move out things, etc.< /Review></record>

<text>We've lived in phase 1, behind the main building for over a year now and find the apartment unworthy of its price. The apartment is very very old which results in really old and creaky fittings (e.g., the sound from our exhaust vents will make you feel like you are taking off on an aeroplane). This section is pretty poorly maintained too. The stairs and corridors are rarely cleaned. Very often we have the smell of food seeping in to the apartment either from the barbecue pit or from neighbors' homes through our kitchen chimney (never understood why until someone explained that they keep their chimney system switched off because people complain about the noise it makes).We've made several complaints, but maintenance has been pretty unresponsive. Overall, this section of the property is definitely not worth its price. My wife and I will be moving out at the end of our lease. Would not recommend this place.<//text><Time>1522305161486< /Time><rate>1< /rate><gmapID>0x808f7fd6dd702f27:0xb55a40a334590773<//gmapID>< pics>

Great amenities, the staff are helpful and resourceful, and the location is perfect - right next to transit, shops, restaurants etc'.
It's not cheap but it's worth it.
The extra services you get actually save you time and money, e.g. I had maintenance and deliveries of furniture in my apartment while I was at work (they'll let people into your apartment with written permission).
Oh and there's hot coffee in the lobby in the morning. :)< /Review>

1. Temporary staff at the apartment so when I locked myself out. I had to pay $200-300 dollars to uber back and forth in Palo Alto because I didn’t have my key and no one can let me up.
2. Messing up my washing machine and requiring weeks without a washer and not notifying me about parts being shipped at all.
3. Having to wake me up at 5am in the morning when I contacted the management office to let my friend in the day before and her not being able to stay at my place and almost drunkenly driving home to Palo Alto. (Yes this almost happened because of your miscommunication to the front desk to let her in)
4. The utility fees that have been accumulating over the last several months and were only recently brought up to my attention
5. Messing up billing on my parking spot multiple times and having to call to resolve it. This happened 2 times
6. Gave me a smaller parking spot that my car could not fit in even though my original spot was fine. Lied about it.

Front desk staff: Been really friendly.

Honestly, it’s the leasing office. Never met more incompetent people in my life. Even to get the sign up fee for my friends took a while. I hate this place and hope people read this to strongly encourage others to value where they spend their money. I hope specific incidents and how they handled it speaks to the type of experience you will have. Here’s a quote to end this review: Life contains but two tragedies. “One is not to get your heart’s desire; the other is to live in Avalon with the current leasing office.”< /Review></record>

<Name>Alexander Morris</Name><time>1535047528241</time><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>If you’re going to pay a lot of money for a “luxury” apartment complex, do a little better than this place. My boyfriend* and I had to move to the Bay from out of state quickly, and finding a pet-friendly place in the right location wasn’t easy. Avalon did make everything pretty easy to sign with them. We did not get to see the apartment we would be moving into, but we saw a few “similar” apartments. Well, turns out the apartment we were moving into was not only much smaller than the ones we were shown, but covered in white carpet. We would NEVER have agreed to move into a carpeted apartment, especially when every place we were shown was hardwood. We have a black lab, white carpet does not go with that lifestyle. The apartment was also just poorly laid out and we literally felt stuck in a shoebox. We were paying penthouse prices for what was only minimally nicer than my college apartment. David, in the leasing office also didn’t make it clear that loading dock wasn’t “like available whenever” and you had to reserve the loading dock for only 4 hours. We had to unload our POD at an offsite location and pay hundreds of extra dollars in movers. Not all Avalon’s fault, where was I planning to leave said POD idk, but Avalon’s staff could have communicated a lot clearer.
Besides that, everything was okay after. Things got fixed in a timely fashion, most of the front desk people were helpful, and the neighbors didn’t bother us. Parking was ridiculous, $325/mo and you can’t even open your doors all the way without hitting the car next to you. A bit egregious if you ask me.
We were already obviously unhappy with our living situation (made the best of it). Honestly, we were going to renew though. It was just going to be a lot easier to stay put than move. Well, that was before Avalon came at us with the comical lease renewal offer. They wanted us to pay an additional $300-400/mo! For what? No thanks. We found a cheaper place, twice the size with parking included, for less. Goodbye Avalon.
Especially on moveout, we noticed Avalon’s leasing office seems to be allergic to transparent communication. A few days before we were officially moved out, they did a “quick walkthrough” without any notice. The leasing office insisted they did provide notice, they didn’t. I’m not making it up for my convenience, we did not receive proper notice. When it came time for the final walkthrough, they did not allow us to be there. Cool. For the next following weeks, we tried calling to follow up on things and no one in the leasing office was ever available to take our calls or call us back. We got a check the other day for about half our security deposit. They supposedly had to replace the carpet we never wanted to begin with. Oh well. It is what it is. Really wish they could have bothered to communicate with us better. You pay all this money just to be treated pretty callously. We don’t need pampering, just a little communication would have been nice. They were all available to communicate when it came to getting us to sign a lease and shell out money for them, but when we served our purpose and gave them no more value, who cares. If you’re paying this much money, you expect a lot better customer service. Or maybe all their good customer service was given only to the people on here who wrote 5 star reviews!

*despite the leasing office insisting on referring to my boyfriend Thomas as my “roommate” instead of my BOYFRIEND. I mean we were living in a 1BR1BA... I think it’s safe to say we weren’t roommates.<//Review>< pictures>

The building is cheaply constructed and the apartments at the front are very, very noisy with the Muni riding by every few minutes. We have a maintenance problem that remained unresolved for an entire year. The shared penthouse room with the pool table is best part of the complex. It's extremely expensive and I was happy to leave at the end of our lease.< /Text>

Lived here for over a year now and it seriously is one of the best, if not the best, places to live in the City. The access to multiple transportation options and proximity to the ballpark is what drew me to the complex but the great and friendly staff and prompt and courteous service is what will keep me for years.</review>

Avoid this place at all costs. Appliances  are very old and break often. Maintenance does not respond to service requests and the manager never picks up the phone. We had two incidednts which the stove broke. It took 10  "TEN"  DAYS to replace after we have been calling them constantly. Then the microvawe broke. It's been a WEEK AND NO ONE has responded or updated us on when it will arrive.  So both occasions we had a hardtime living  without having basic kitchen essentials. They were never compensated.  Can you imagine living 10 plus days without a stove or a microwave? We do have young children at home and we informed the maintenance how important it is for us to have this appliances replaced immediately. How hard is it for a management company to replace a microwave? If you are busy person, this is not your place.

But the monthly statements and the staff "going out " days are always promptly reminded via email.  Please save your money and stay away from this scam.
They do not provide any services to justify the amount you pay.

The phase two gym smells like urine. It is extremely unhygenic.

Most phase 2 concierge people are nice but there is one grumpy lady who always yells at every tenant and guests like they owe her money. She is always in a bad mood and often pass sarcastic comments. Avalon doesn't seem to mind the quality of their hospitality services. You will often see "stepping out " notices from front desk and packages left out without supervision.

There are so many upcoming properties coming up in mission bay. This place is old and the floor plans are terrible.

The only pro I see is the location. But within mission bay, there are many brand new properties with better services.

THIS PLACE IS A SCAM! read other tenants reviews on yelp and see for your self.</review>

Only AT&T u-verse available while random units in other phases are gifted with Comcast. Internet comes to a crawling halt around peak hours when everyone is watching Netflix. Hallway smells like garbage. I mean it smells like rotten garbage and pet manure all day long. The plumbing is a joke. Think of those portable showers you bring along on your camping trip. Now imagine that water becoming scalding hot and ice cold intermittently. The water system breaks down all the time and apartment building is left with no water at least once a month. Whoever built this 18-story tower must have graduated from IKEA. Epitome of made in china cheap modern.</Text>

My fiance and I stayed at the Avalon during the summer of 2016 and we loved the building.Though a little pricey (what isnt in SF though?), the amenities and location more than make up for it. The community has 2 gyms, bbq area, indoor basketball court, sky lounge, 24 hr concierge, and several community rooms, one with a very unique climbing wall! There's also free coffee everyday and free tickets to Giants games available periodically to residents.

The location is excellent with extremely easy access to all sorts of transit (2 muni lines, Caltrain, and bus).  It was nice that the Avalon has 3 buildings that we could access - I think this allowed for a greater number of amenities to be available to the community.

The staff was extremely attentive throughout our short 3 month stay and renting furniture through their partner Brooks made our move in and move out seamless.  If circumstances bring us back to the area, we would definitely consider living here again!<//text>

<Text>My wife, our little furball and I moved to Avalon Mission Bay North from Manhattan back in 2014.

Undeniably the community's location is second to none, offering quick access to grocery stores, public transportation, parks and speedy access to the highway.
Given that my wife works from home, going the extra mile for housing made a lot of sense, particularly given the presence of an onsite gym and of a 24/7 concierge desk.

I am not going to lie, our first year at Avalon ended up being rocky as we ran into several issues, ranging from loud neighbors, break-ins inside the low rise where we were initially living in, to second hand cigarette smoke infiltrating our apartment. While I am at it, I'd say that in some areas of the community, apartments are filled with young kids rooming together, which gives a noisy college dorm style to the community.
Thankfully, a few months after our 2nd move within the community, things have turned out for the best and we are looking forward to renewing our lease.

Most importantly, I wanted to give a shout out to a few folks that over the past 2 years have gone above and beyond. In no particular order:

- Danilo Baldoza: top notch technician, always gets things done at the first maintenance visit. Specifically, thank you for making up for the sloppy work from a previous technician and getting our window sealing replaced correctly.
- Javier Carpio: extremely courteous person, always smiling when running into him in the elevator or in the hallways.
- Elizabeth Castro: she has a special place in our hearts, as she is always all about to our little furball.
- Marisol Cothern: professional and conscientious member of the staff. She follows through, is dilligent and always with a smile. We are glad to have you with us.
- Christian Manuel: courteous, always gets stuff done right off the bat and always with a big smile.
- Jai Meiers: he is the man. Enough said.
- Raymond Mitra: extremely sweet and helpful. Thank you for all those morning smiles.
- Cristine Rodriguez: our #1 community consultant, hands down. She nailed our 2nd lease and we are looking forward to working with her again.
- Rommel Santo Domingo: extremely dedicated to his work, effectively delivering stunning service across the board.
- Jason Sypult: Jason saved us from many community related issues. Namely, my wife and I always talk about how he was able to bring the second hand smoke issue we faced to an end.

Thank you all for delivering spectacular service!</Text>< user_name>

<review>I lived here for 4 years and absolutely loved the experience.

The price is a bit steep, but then again we all have come to expect that in the gentrified parts of San Francisco right. The fittings are good but not really great (phase 3 and properties across the street are a bit better in that regard), but when you add the price and quality up it comes down to a good value for money.

What's really easy to love about this place is that the Safeway is right across the street, some of the best restaurants of SF are all in walking distance, the Caltrain and 2 muni lines and dozens of busses all stop right at that block - so your commute into the city or down to the valley will be shorter then ever.

There's also Genentech, Google, Facebook and so on shuttles right there since they all stop at the Caltrain station - so it doesn't really get better then that.< /review>< Pics>

Why go to a farmers' market, when you can go to the farm itself? Of course, you have to be in the area to visit. I've shopped with them at the Hollywood Farmers Market before, so I was familiar with their operation.
My friend and I were there just prior to Halloween, so they'd also setup a family friendly pumpkin patch along with wheel barrows to lug the pumpkins around!
In their store, there was a wide array of freshly picked produce. I was frankly impressed!<//review>

I've been staying at Beach City for about a month now. I've had no problem with the apartment and its nice en newly renovated. It's close to SBCC and just a short walk to get down to the beach. I love the location! Another great thing is you get to meet meet a lot of people who also live at BC.  The staff working here are nice and helpful. I've mostly been in contact with Ava and she's been very helpful and gives you great advice for how to make your stay here as good as possible.<//Text>

<text>I can't thank this place enough for the experience it has given my first year of college. Its truly in one of the most advantageous places with great access to the city college campus, beach, the mesa and state street. Also the staff/St George associates at Beach City gave me an incredibly warm welcome when I first came and helped me with all my needs. They are essentially awesome sauce. Beach City is the steezest place to be as a freshman going to the SBCC.< /text>< Pictures>

REVISION: Ava, has saved me from a horrible situation (i wish i never had to endure). The staff CARE. while St.George himself is money hungry, the staff who aren't making millions are there to help. If you are extremely assertive and follow procedure you can get virtually whatever is bothering you fixed. If you are meek, or tend to be a people pleaser definitely not your place. If you want to have a good time, party, and meet people who are outgoing (and maybe TOO outspoken to the point where its unbearable) This is for you. As a person who tends to want to mind my own business, or at the very least; expects people who I party with to care about others safety, this was a worst case scenario. My main issue was with my roommates, please for the love of god do not get random roommates. They also recently added a skate park that attracts random people from the area (especially kids and lots of non residents) who drink and skate very loudly at whatever time of day or night they want.

When we moved in things were broken and bugs were everywhere. Kitchen was absolutely ruined old cabinets that dont close coil stoves that looked very very old. actually one of the most disgusting things ive ever seen. Ava lobbied for our unit to be remodeled and now we have a great kitchen (super grateful but sad it took 6 months of my lease to get a decent kitchen :/) still issues with bad furniture.<//review>

< review>
Living in beach city a couple years back was a big highlight of my college experience, tons to do and amazing staff that were on call 24/7 and always super kind and helpful.. even when locked out at 3 am lol! I must say though even after leaving they’ve remained great! Natty was huge help when I called and posed an issue regarding a drivers license the dmv had sent to my old apartment that I thought was a complete goner and had zero sympathy from the governmental agency, no surprise there, Natty recognized the importance and went out of her way multiple times to contact the new residents and not only retrieved my license but sent it to me free of charge!!!! Saving me much money and wasted time I’m extremely happy with this case.. now living in the real world no apartment staff would ever 10/10 experience before during and after residency !!!</review>

Honestly, I saw how bad the reviews where on here and Yelp especially but I didn't want to believe it because beach city looked like such a cool place but do not move here it's not worth it and nothing special the only good thing is that it's close to the school and if I could give them no stars I would. They don't help you with anything. There are much better places to live in santa barbara which I may have to pay a little more but it's worth it.</review>

For some odd reason it says 2 something stars when it’s gorgeous here I look out my window and see the ocean and I hear the waves crashing almost consistently the students and faculty do everything they can to not only make sure you are safe but happy and message to anyone that feels scared to ask to change rooms don’t be! They will accommodate you to their fullest extent and not stop until you are in a place you feel comfortable don’t listen to the bad  reviews because if you come here and ask any out of the hundreds of people here they will tell you<//text>

Beach city is a great place to live especially as a SBCC student! As a student living here for two years now I haven’t had any problems whatsover! It’s very convince to be this close to school and to live here with other students . The staff is amazing!!! I love them all so much they are the best people here I’ve met including, Teresa, Costa,Evan, Asia, etc are all super helpful with anything and they are my favorite staff! Also, the property manager Ava is super helpful when ever there is a problem and always helps us right away. Living at beach city got me to meet people who I know call my best friends and I bet that wouldn’t be the case if I didn’t live here! There needs to be more good reviews because it’s one great experience that ur place will be clean as long as you keep it that way! My appliances worked and I lived here again for a second year! Especially this year beach city helped renovate my apartment and it looks amazing! The owner is one of my favorite and I’ll definatly be missing him and the rest of the staff once I have to move out!</Text>

Beach city is awesome! I read some of the other reviews and I haven't heard of anyone who's experienced any of those things. It's so close to school and it has a great gym facility and study room. The staff is amazing their some of the best people I met, and Evan in particular always helps me with anything I need and is a great addition to the beach city staff! All the staff here is amazing and helpful (Teresa, Lauren, Costa, etc.) If I didn't live at beach city I definitely wouldn't have any social life, but at the same time, everyone focuses on their things during the week. Don't know why people give it bad reviews, it isn't overpriced and your place will remain clean if you keep it clean and tidy, it was perfectly clean when I moved in and all the appliances work as well! Definitely living here next year!</text>

<text>Sharing from personal experience as we have a son and a daughter, Beach City offers a synergistic living experience, the perfect balance between student social life inclusive of fun interactive events in a safe environment and academic life.  This balance i feel was the key enabling factor which led to the success not only academically but also personally for my son and daughter.  They both started out in other living situations that proved to be less than optimal for them academically and they both began to improve upon entering Beach City living so I feel I can somewhat factually attribute their success to Beach City living.   The staff has been wonderful, extremely caring and helpful, so much so that during stressful and trying times my son and daughter would come to them for added support and encouragement and still to this day, post graduation, stay in contact.  Beach City has proven to be a Godsend for our family and I would highly recommend it.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>This place is awesome! It's practically perfect for students because you can walk to class, there's a gym, study hall and pool on the property. You don't have to bring a car either to get around SB because they have Zip Cars.  As a father of 2 girls, I feel comfortable knowing that Beach City has a ton of surveillance cameras and a security team.< /Review>< resp>

The zip is gone-but we are still steps from class and a quick walk to the beach. No car needed. I\'m about that bike life. How about you?  Thanks again for the review.'}<//resp>

Incredibly overpriced, management is run my college students. The apartments and townhomes have terrible air quality. If you like to party a lot this is the place for you, otherwise find another place to live. Beach City is a mistreated trashcan.<//Text>

<text>I honestly love Beach City and its staff! It is my first year of college and this place has the amazing environment that I was looking for, especially being located so close to campus and the beach. I had a problem with my parking spot at the beginning of the year and also some roommate drama, which the office helped get both of those issues resolved! They were very accommodating and friendly when it came to my concerns. It is such a fun and upbeat little community and I am so happy to have gotten the chance to live here.<//text><resp>None< /resp></record>

Your roommate will do drugs in your apartment against your wishes and your parking spot will always be taken by somebody else. The wifi is good i guess. Rent is outrageous and there are always loud noises in every direction. Avoid this place.< /Review>

If you’re planing on failing all of your classes and partying every night, this is the place for you! However, if you’re interested in sleeping, I would not recommend living here. The security is extremely lazy and the owners choose to do nothing about the partying that happens everyday.< /Text>

<Text>Beach City is affordable and extremely convenient. Along with the 5 minute walk to class and 3 min walk to the beach, the memories and friends you make here are one of a kind. I’ve been living here for a few months now and have nothing bad to say. All the staff are super friendly and helpful. So happy with my decision in picking Beach City; wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.<//Text><Response>None< /Response><rating>5</rating>< user_name>

<Text>Beach City has provided a great first living environment for me ever since I moved in last year. It's the perfect atmosphere for first years who don't know anyone to make friends because of the heavy sense of community that Beach City offers. This was the case for me, as I moved in knowing no one and now have developed friendships with people that I consider some of my closest friends. The social experience alone is enough to make living here worth it to me, although on top of this Beach City borders the SBCC campus, essentially being on-campus housing except not being owned or constricted by SBCC. All this with the final added bonus being my balcony view of the ocean that I get to wake up to every morning. Definitely would recommend living here if you're an SBCC student looking for a place to a live in Santa Barbara.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Beach city is so much more than an apartment complex to me. At beach city, I have thrived to become my best self. I am constantly surrounded by warm and familar faces that have become my family. I feel one with the world here. I am able to reach above and beyond my limitations and succeed. As a full time college student, I feel as though I am surrounded by equally motivated and intelligent individuals all of which share a common goal: to aid each other in becoming the best versions our ourselves.< /text>< pictures>

This place is awful. Please don’t waste your money to move in here there are plenty of other places close enough to the school. The maintence person should be fired as he is incredibly bad at his job and will refuse to repair things that naturally break in your apartment. The owners are money hungry and the staff is incompetent. PS the only reason they are getting 5 star reviews is either A) they bribe people with free hats and other stupid things. Or B) it is people applying to be an RA here and so they are almost obligated to rate it they way that they do. The potential is here but the execution is so pathetic that they will need to clear their entire staff to make this place even close to how much money it costs to live here. Over $800 a month to share a small room with 2 other guys. And prices are going up. This place is a joke.<//Text>

I’ve been living at Beach City for two semesters now. It’s a really cool place to live in and the apartments are in a really good condition. Personally I love living at Beach City and in Santa Barbara. Beach City is by far the best place to stay at in my opinion. It’s close to the beach and the school, almost all the tenants are students with a mix of Americans and internationals.  Lot of things are included in the rent and you also have access to a pool.< /Text>

This place is a money-pumping machine. They cut all kinds of corners and it tends to be generally pretty dirty. It's not all bad but I'd suggest looking into other places. I'm giving this one-star review because they're giving out free hats for 5-star reviews. My real opinion is more near three-stars.</Text>

I lived at beach city my first year of attending city college and after having a great and memorable year i decided to resign my lease for my second year. The staff is friendly and accommodative and they have security to monitor and keep the place safe. It a great place to live to meet people and be social and beach city host events often to  allow residents to meet each other and feel like a community. I highly recommend beach city!< /Text>

This is an awesome apartment complex, especially for first year students! I moved to SB from a different state, not knowing many people and nervous to be starting college. Beach City is amazing for the amenities and all utilities included with rent. It may seem like a high price, but you're getting a ton for your money. I made so many friends and met lots of great people for the year I was there. The leasing managers are super sweet and are good about helping with anything you may need. Although people are nervous because of all the bad reviews online, it's obvious that they are trying to fix any previous problems and make living there the best it can be. I would recommend it to anyone, and had a fun easy going year!<//text>

The actual location of this place is INCREDIBLE. Right by the ocean and school so it's a very good place for first year students. I've met some awesome people here so far but if you don't like partying, drinking, and being around drugs and noise, I'd suggest going to other nearby apartments and getting roommates. Some staff are very helpful but the people higher up, particularly the main manager was very rude when we expressed our concern about our town house which didn't come with basic things like blinds, lights, etc and were placed months later than they should have. So, there are some rude people, but overall, i've had a really really good time being here.</Text>

DO NOT RENT FROM THESE PEOPLE!
Absolutely horrible experience. Here at beach shitty they go out of their way to make your living experience as horrible as possible. These people are crooks. For example, they neglected my wish for a pretty move out inspection until I was gone, then deducted a good portion of my deposit for reasons that are absolute bs.
They're quick to fine, and molasses when it comes to solving problems. Want more? How about the giant wasp nest that they put off until my girlfriend threatened to sue. That's what it takes to get anything done here. Threatening to sue. Save yourself the headache, I wish I had.</Review>

Do not bother, so many other places that are close to the school that don't cost an arm and a leg to live at.  Management sucks, and the owner is so rich and will try to take as much money from you as possible.  I'm scared to get my security deposit back because I feel like there wont be one...< /Text>

<review>Living at Beach City has been an unforgettable experience and one I will take with me everywhere I go. I found Beach City on a craigslist post and was unsure if i was moving to SB in the first place. When I arrived on site, i was flattered with the service and community already set in place. As the year progressed I ended up making friends from all over the globe giving me connections I would of normally never made. The convince of the location from town, school, and beach are incomparable to other complexes. Not only am i satisfied with a piece of mind knowing my apartment is renovated leaving me free of worry of infestations or mold, but we are also accompanied by staff who will drop everything to help anyone with any issue small or big. Two years ago I choose Beach City and if I were to choose again I would make the same choice. But don't take my word for it, come down and check the community out for your self I promise you will love it.<//review>< pictures>

I have lived at Beach city for two years now and have enjoyed every minute of it.  I was glad to get great roomates and live in a very clean apartment. I also got to meet various security guards who were very friendly and one guard imparticular (Leo) has become a really good friend of mine.  This place is also very convenient because it is steps from the local community college and quick stroll to the beach. I was extremely pleased living here and am sad to leave.</text>

Beach City is a great complex, with an awesome atmosphere and very helpful staff. Not to mention, it's located within a 5 minute walk to the ocean. Overall, Beach City is an incredible place to live, and I'd recommend it to any SBCC student searching for housing!</Text>

<Review>I've lived at beach city for a year and I can honestly say that it is the best housing decision I could have made for my first year at SBCC. When you actually visit the beach city campus it is so beautiful and all of the apartments are nice. It looks how it looks online. I chose randomized roommates which could have ended badly but all my roommates are now my best friends. All of the units in our building have made friends with each other and it's like a little family. I couldn't imagine living anywhere else because you just meet so many good people here and keep them close, which is usually super difficult to do considering it's a city college. It feels like that real college experience. I was nervous reading the reviews online before coming here, but after experiencing it for myself I realized that people only go out of their way to leave negative reviews and never write about the good. I've never had trouble with fines or maintenance and everything has been wonderful. And it's not just me, all of my roommates are equally happy with our setup. I would definitely recommend moving here over anywhere else.</Review>< resp>

Beach City is a beautiful and conveniently located apartment complex for students at SBCC. The staff is understanding and host great events. Such as movie nights, taco Tuesdays, and pool parties. I can get to any location on campus in 5minutes and the beach is 3mins away. They have a clean pool and volleyball court.</text>

The management at Beach City is very bad and unorganized. It's run by teenagers who don't know how to deal with confused tenants and future inhabitants at Beach City when there is an issue. On the website it says they have a gym that is well equipped but it's literally just a punching bag and bench outside. The pool is also tiny despite the way they made it look online. No parking for guests and overall not a very honest place. Very disappointed.< /review>

I’ve lived here for almost 4 months now and i love it so far, super friendly staff and RA’s, 3 minutes away from classes and the beach. You don have to drive to school & find parking which is everyone’s nightmare at sbcc. The past reviews may seem bad but beach city has made sooo many amazing changes the past year to better the living for us students. 11/10 recommend & wouldn’t want to live anywhere else<//text>

<Review>Choosing to live at Beach City has proved to be one of the best choices I've made. When I first decided to attend SBCC, I was especially anxious about what my living situation would be like since I was coming alone. After living here for almost two years, I can honestly claim that Beach City is the perfect situation for all students who are either first years or new to the area. It puts them in an environment that makes it so easy to meet those people you'll want to get a house with afterwards, instead of risking sharing a lease with strangers from craigslist.  Everyone who lives here attends SBCC so it's incredibly social and like it's own little bubble (you can't not make friends here!), it's ridiculously close to the school (2min walk), and basically in center of anything you'll ever need (groceries, beach, downtown, etc.). Management is always very friendly and the maintenance requests I've put in has always been fixed within 3 days. It's also clear that management has been doing nothing but making changes for the better, like creating a new study lounge and throwing events every single week that almost always involves free food! I feel like the most recent reviews can also attest to the changes being made, and that most people who are unhappy usually just aren't taking care of their apartment properly and wait until problems get worse before calling the office or putting in a request. If you are going to attend SBCC and are new to the area, than Beach City definitely is a great choice!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Lived here both semesters of 2018 they extort the residents things go broken for weeks and when they send a repair man he usually makes it worse doesn’t say anything and leaves. Avoid at all costs unless you want things stolen or drunken idiots puking/pissing in your kitchen. Go sit on a pole beach city.</Review>< pictures>

If you are moving to Santa Barbara Beach City is the place to live! It's a great komplex with really nice neighbours and the people who work here are really nice and helpful. It's two minutes to SBCC and five minutes to the beach. You get access to pool, different activites that brings the whole komplex together, and every month they organizes trips around California. As a international student I would really recommend to sign a contract as fast as you can! They're absolutely the best!!<//Review>

THEY ARE GIVING OUT FREE HATS FOR FIVE STAR REVIEWS
If a place only has one star and five star reviews, THATS A RED FLAG
DO NOT GIVE THESE CROOKS YOUR MONEY

WORST MANAGEMENT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. They are rude, unhelpful, and are quicker to fine you than to solve a problem. On top of that, they will randomly barge into your apartment without even letting you know they were gonna come by, and threaten to evict you if you have friends over.

For example, One day my boyfriend and I were hanging out in my room, when suddenly we hear someone knock at the door once, and by the time I had gotten out of my room there were three random people from the office standing in my living room. When I asked why they were there, instead of answering my question,the owners wife Claudia rudely told me that it was not alright to have my boyfriend over and that if he spends the night I could be evicted. She had no grounds to say these things, as there was nothing in my lease that said I couldn't have guests and the only mention of it was that I could only have overnight guests three nights a month.

If that wasn't enough for you, they will definitely DEDUCT at least TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS from your deposit for random bs reasons they can get away with billing you for. THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS.< /text>

<text>I highly recommend student do not fall into the scam that is 'Beach City' simply because of it's location, as i will go on to address below:

You can see how it may be a little frustrating to pay $800 dollars for a bed in a two bedroom house with five random college students. However, it becomes even more frustrating when you try to disregard the overpriced rate, for the accessibility of the school (which is literally steps away), but still be late to class. -Why? Well, Beach City decided to tighten up their security with gate cards, though the gate which is used the most often (to rush to class) is padlocked by night staff, as St. Gorge's and Associates are cheap and inefficient scam artist. No  resident would say otherwise.

This has happened numerous times including today (2/29), as I myself have had to toss my bag over and climb a wired fence at 7:30am and back after class at 9:45am.

There are several other disgraceful issues with this residence and management. Despite new management, who will probably respond to this with a passive aggressive defensive tone rather than fixing any actual issues.

Though, Katey Fallon, (the new manager) was in fact confronted with this issue in person an hour or so ago. Fallon, blatantly  disregarded complaints in an unprofessional manor with a belittling and condescending attitude as she told residential students to walk around  though it defeats the entire purpose of having a gate directly on the steps of SBCC.

I have posted a photo of students climbing over the fence to get to class with the pad locked gate, if you'd like evidence.<//text>< Pics>

Ok let me start by saying I was an RA at Beach City and when I went to write a review I was blown away by all the negative  reviews . Maybe one or two are legit but I have personal knowledge that 3 of the 1 star reviews were nightmare tenants and the girl complaining about her boyfriends not being able to spend the night is a certified psyc case ,do you want to share a room with a screamer !!! Bottom line is I wanted to thank Beach City for not only giving me a job to help pay my rent but also say that the people I worked for were huge !!<//Text>

Steven is great! Everyone there is unusually kind for being in the Pawn business... I would recommend these guys to anyone. In these uncertain times, I came across difficult times and was unable to retrieve my item (very important and very valuable - at least twice what I owed on ebay). They could have sold it at a hearty profit, but they worked with me, till I was able to pick it up this weekend. They are always kind and understanding and have a professional work ethic and follow up on their promises.
Thank you,  gentlemen! This customer is great that you are one of the rare, good guys, left around nowadays.  Be well... and Grazie Milli<//Text>

PB Loan and Jewelry is the best in the area! They really try to help you out unlike other pawn shops in the area. I was struggling financially and had to sell a lot of my stuff. I came here after literally getting no offers from other pawn shops and ended up actually getting good offers for my stuff here. The employees were extremely helpful and very patient with all my questions. Anyone that needs a loan or wants to pawn something, I really recommend these guys. They're the best!< /Text>

I have been a loyal customer since.i would say 2015.  I have always received top notch service.  Steven and Santino are great.  I have many musical instruments that I have taken loans on, paid them back. ,and have always been treated with politeness and great respect.   As we all know ,this Covid business has made money tight for all.  It had slipped my mind that my loans were due...

Not to worry.  Steven calls me in time! An awesome courtesy call!  Santino and Steven guided me on the easiest , most convenient way to affordably
get my account "Paid Current:"
Without the chance of losing my merchandise.
I was texted a link that completely explained how to complete this transaction without haveling to  come into the shop..

I will and do recommend this shop to everybody I know.
In PB and beyond!
Steven and Santino! Thanks you guys!

I recently purchased a jewelry item in the shop. Juan was so very nice. He went above and beyond to make me feel at ease and secure about my purchase. They are very trustworthy and honest. I am a very happy customer.</review>

terrible place!!1 i had a loan there that has been there for 6+ years... i was yelled and and hung up on by Cassandra when i asked for a manager....  because i had been hospitalized for weeks and missed my loan expiration.... Albert called me back and was very professional and handled my concerns immediately..... Cassandra was rude and uncalled for... i have called since then and she was rude as well.... terrible customer service for a long time client, sickening...</Text>

< Review>
Old Town Uhaul has won my business for years to come & I will Always refer family or friends here. I am never let down by any of the staff members. The trucks are so clean and everyone is so helpful. Especially the older gentleman, I always see him working so hard yet making it look so easy. Everyone has helped me in every way possible for my rental.< /Review>

Yeah the sign says 1995 a day but don't forget about the mileage which they don't say which is $0.80 that adds up when you go a hundred miles or plus crazyI say it's false advertisement they have to say 1995 a day plus mileage<//Text>

Will, there is a sign on your premises that say 24/7 and when me and my father went to return the truck that we picked from Chula Vista even though we were supposed to pick it up from Escondido. Your employee made us return it in Temecula instead.

Your service is horrible<//Text>

I really didn't care for their manager. She was very hostile and aggressive and I felt I was sorely mistreated. Overall, it was a horrible horrible horrible rental experience, and I hope to God Uhaul gets wind of how disgraceful they are being represented at this one location. I've used Uhaul for decades, but save yourself the headache and just go a few blocks north on this same road. There's 2-3 other Uhaul's on the same street, only the other locations actually treat you like a respectable humane being (and no, the other locations are not paying me to say this).<//Review>

My husband who has cancer (when he needs to go he really needs to go) and when he asked to use their restroom she said they don't have a public restroom.  I explained to her my husband's situation and even told her he could pee in his pants if he didn't go right away.  She had the nerve to tell me there was one down the street at the gas station and that it was a liability issue (lie) if he used the restroom.  No wonder this place has so many terrible reviews.  There is a Uhaul we passed on our way here, wish we had reserved there, ugh!!!</text><Gmap_id>0x80db7fbe5ba745f3:0x3c80a20cc3d7361c< /Gmap_id><UserId.>104516550685653654711</UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None<//pics><Rating>1<//Rating><name>tamra rehak<//name>< time>

Rented on the 25th and returned it the same day and paid cash. Not only did they overcharge us but later that day they created a second invoice stating we picked up on the 25th and returned on the 29th (never happened) and made a promissory note that we had to pay within a few days. Called customer service and they are horrible. Created a case said a manger would contact me within 72 hours of course I heard nothing. 7 days later I call again and they said there was never a case created, mind you I have the case number they gave me. Talked to the manger and he was so rude and finally said he would take care of it. I asked for proof that it was taken care of and no longer in collections to damage my credit and he said he can't do that. He has nothing to send me as proof. This company is a joke! Still waiting to find out if it was actually taken care of.</review>

2 months ago. They charged me for an extra day because I was 15 minutes late. And then they charged me for a full tank of gas, FULL TANKS WORTH because he said I was "under". The needle was literally under by about the thickness of a line drawn by a ball point pen. And his reason was "we gotta make money somehow"</review>

Worst service ever! Made me wait 45 min to rent a trailer but charged me double when I was 30 min late after they told me it was ok to be a little late

. Also lied on the contract on when I actually rented the trailer . Seems like they have a system on ripping Temecula residents off if you look at the other reviews .

Your minimum wage employees will be back to selling crack when your company fails on front street ! NEVER RENT FROM HERE!!!</text>

I called Doug at U-Haul Old Town Temecula CA branch and explained to him that I had a gift certificate because I was over charged by U-Haul on my last rental and he asked me for my certificate number I explained to him that when I was given the certificate I was told by the u-haul employees that I just needed to give my name and email address he told me he would not honor it told me to go F**k myself and told me he didn't want to do business with me and to take my business else where so I called and made a reservation with Penske however after thinking about it for a day I decided that not everyone at every U-Haul acts like a child like Doug so I called the guys at the U-Haul at 25086 Jefferson Ave Murrieta, CA they were excellent and they honored my gift certificate that I was given by the Old Town branch.  I don't know who would actually want to deal with Doug at Old Town Temecula U-Haul my guess is that he was picked on as a child and beat up on the play ground.  Next time I call U-Haul I will def be calling the guys on Jefferson st they def know how to treat their customers as for Doug he lost my business for Life.<//text>

Simply the very worst service you want when renting a truck. I would not use this place again if it was the last truck rental company in all of Temecula. You shouldn't either.< /text>

<text>I called first thing and spoke with Jack about my tire pressure sensor going off. He told me to come by at 8, which I did. He checked the pressure, had his guy check the tire for nails. It did indeed have a big one, dang it. He removed the nail, was able to repair it and sent me on my way. And he didn't charge me! I just found my new tire and oil change shop in town. It's hard to find great customer service sometimes, I am thrilled. Thank you!!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>These guys are the best. Jack is the man. He is honest and always works hard to get things done quickly. I just bought four new tires. Believe me, I shopped online and they have the best price around. I needed a special size tire that they didn’t have in stock. Their driver went out of his way approximately two hours to deliver the tires so I could have them today. Excellent service. They have my business for life.</Text><Date>1612657255542<//Date><userid>111599528956640267544< /userid>< Rate>

We are so grateful for the many years of honest, affordable, quick and thorough service from Ramona. Not only do they service our tire and alignment needs, we get all our oil changes and brake work there. Our last visit was sure to have a large price tag, but Jack was able to get us out for only an 8$ part! We love this place 😎</Review>

I'm always skeptical of car service centers. However you can rest at ease at Ramona. They are very professional and transparent. Probably the best service I've had for a long time, and reasonably priced< /Text>

I had a simple tire repair. The gentleman was so kind and helpful, even though they weren’t going to make money from the service to my car. They promptly called me when my tire was patched  and I was treated just as nicely when I picked my car up.<//review>

Ramona tire Jack Nunez always has offered excellent service and he & his crew seem to work hard! Their pricing is straight forward and they keep a clean shop. I’ve felt confident about the brake work done and tire change balance etc. I’m a returning customer because of the first impression and don’t regret it. These guys are the real and you won’t get oversold or pressured just honest service . I highly recommend Ramona Tire & Service San Clemente< /Review>

Great customer service. I highly recommend this place for all your vehicle’s needs. The manager Jack is very honest and helpful which is great because a lot of places aren’t. He will recommend what your vehicle needs and if it needs to be done sooner rather than later. I have an older truck so it is always a little scary dropping it off for an oil change. They are completely honest and do not try to upsell you on anything.</text>

Excellent service! Highly recommend! I bought 4 new Hankook tires. I called 2 other places and they could not be bothered to talk to me about the kind of tires I wanted. Jack at Ramona tires was interested in my business.  I traveled the extra few miles to San Clemente and I could be happier!! They also did my rear breaks. No selling me what I didnt need. Great prices!!! Thanks !!!<//text>

<review>The guys here are really friendly and very eager to help you.  In my case I was leaking air from my driver's side front tire.  The gentleman did his diagnostic tests and told me that my issue could be the tire stem sensor and that since it was cold out to just keep putting air in the tire when needed (which wasn't too often, just annoying) and if I didn't mind holding out, give it a month or so to see if it was influenced by the cold weather.  I went back 2 months later and the problem was gone, tire pressure was fine and I was happy to have taken their advice and wait otherwise I would have spent close to $200 for the sensor and installation of it.  Thanks Ramona Tires!!!  Great job, well done!!!</review>< pictures>

< Review>
The initial experience was fine. We spoke with Kara the first day who was who was helpful. The following business day she was not there and let us know Jack would be the one helping us. From there he gave me a call and let me know what they thought needed to be done with the car and that the parts would take some time to come. There were 2 parts that he said needed replaced. A file pump and a fuel pump module. He explained to me that replacing a module when you replace the pump was equivalent to the oil filter when you change the oil, you just always do it. Problem being that it is a 200$ part so I was reluctant to accept a routine part swap at 200$. After the conversation I spoke with multiple other mechanics who said that wasn't the case but I chalked it up to him having expertise I don't so I didn't keep pushing it. The problem arose when I was on KBB looking at the resale value of the car (kind of over the car) and it prompts me there might be a recall on that model. Come to find out after putting in the specific Vin for my vehicle it was a recall for....the module. Immediately I called and spoke to jack again and thankfully caught them before they had began work. I explained on KBB it said there might be a recall so before they continue I wanted to be positive. While on the phone I also checked the manufacturer website and confirm what KBB had said. Jack was unaware of my knowledge of the specific recall for my car  and lied to my face and tried to claim the recall was for something completely independent and that I still needed them to replace both parts. So just to be certain I wasn't losing my mind I called a dealership and now a third time confirmed it was the module being recalled. So I had them stop, had my wife go in after she got off work to pick it up and pay the diagnostic fee and again jack tries to be deceiving and tells her that we will end up having to pay anyway for the work done because the car is not under warranty. Rarely do I ever have an experience so egregious that I feel the need to leave a review but this warranted it.<//Review>

Great place brought my car over for brakes. I was told by Cadillac dealer they needed to be done. Jack's crew looked at it said they didn't need to be done. Great to know there are honest people in this world could have done them charged me and I wouldn't have known any better.. thank you for the honesty and restoring faith that some businesses are are still run on morals and honesty ...Thank You Jack to you and your employees .</text>

I can’t say enough about how great my experience at Ramona was! The store manager, Jack, was extremely helpful from the very beginning, and provided 5-Star service throughout my entire experience. Their team was able to patch my tire in a very timely manner and on a Saturday! Ramona in San Clemente is now my go to place!<//text>

<Review>I woke up this morning to a flat tire. I called Ramona tire and was told it would cost $25 to fix my tire so I put some air in it and drove over. When I arrived they immediately began working on my car. Within a matter of minutes, my tire was fixed and ready to go. I proceeded to the counter to pay... But they said they did this one on the house! I'd never expect something like that so naturally I'm stoked to say the least. Quality service, I will be back.</Review><GmapID>0x80dcf468cada5789:0x3e7e08aea8fe05de</GmapID><userid>116875564395193586430< /userid>< Response>

I was trying to get an alignment, it's not rocket science but the guy kept saying I'll charge you more if is modify!!! It's a Toyota supra not a F1 car. Previous manager back in 2013 was amazing bring him back or I'm never going there again or recommending it to anyone else.<//review>

They have German league, Spanish league, English league, French league,  South American teams, MLS team, and world cup teams. Yes they have it ALL. All authentic all original. Stop looking for " Football " stores cause this is the one for All. The name says it " Pelé !!!!!"<//Review>

The guy tending the store is so polite and nice! During covid he was kind enough to let us use the restroom not too mention they have a great assortment of snackies like gummy sushi but I took home some gummy tacos and gummy pizza! Yum and thanks guy! <3<//Review>

Stop here daily. The workers are all extremely nice. It's become my favourite spot because I get to check in with them. They always offer matches when I buy my smokes which is a small detail to helping the customer that is mostly not practiced these days. Wonderful spot.</Text>

The place is much better than you would think. On twitch it's a different point of view, but this spot has a merch store, a food stand style store inside with the studio being all in the same building. The ambient is great when you arrive but make sure you get there early enough if you want to be in the front. They make a line and they sit you row by row and seat by seat. You dont get much of a say on your seat other than when you arrive and they seat you where they tell you. Feels like a movie theater with every seat not being bad really. Seats were pretty comfortable too so in all honesty, come give these guys a chance and get the full on League of Legends experience.<//text>

Too emotional over words and always copy Valve. At least Valve let’s people be toxic and instead of banning them those that don’t want to deal with the toxicity can just mute them. Definition of emotional.<//text>

One of our son’s works here (he’s a Ringling College grad, just like myself) and on our first of two days in LA before embarking on our Grand Canyon road trip we met him here and he showed us around. Riot Games is the home of the ‘League Of Legends’ online game! It is such a fantastic workplace that I envy him tremendously (he’s as creative as me, if not more so) so I’m proud of him. The original Skywalker Theater is here, along with beautiful decor and more!</Text>

The game was great till season 4 after which the ban system was introduced that still does not work after 5 years. Random bans and apparently it is ok to go afk after min 1 but you will be banned for asking to report that player (negative attitude 😂). This game will not exist in 10 years so I’m happy.

<Review>The Campus is always clean and well kept. Scheduled visitors can enjoy tours and free restaurant quality meals and snacks, as well as the PC bang, a Korean style internet center where you can play the game. Perhaps the best attraction on Riot Games campus is Bilgewater, where you can order a gratis coffee beverage from skilled baristas in pirate themed ambience with theme park quality immersion.< /Review></record>

Intentionally uses any excuse to permaban accounts so that addicted gamers will rebuy characters and skins they have already purchased. 0.006% stat is a NOXIOUS LIE. ANY ACCOUNT WITH OVER 200$ INVESTED WILL GET PERMABANNED FOR ANY REASON RIOT CAN FIND!!!!!!!< /text>

<text>I have been playing LOL game for more than 5 years. Today, I uninstalled the game because there are lot of bad or trolling players who don't care about the ranked games. Riot has no logic to filter out these people. I am always a Jungler, but can't handle 2 trolling laners at the same time. 5 games in the row and team up with these people. They just dont care about their lanes and keep feeding. I am willing to pay to play rather than people that go to ranked games after haven't play for months. Well they just troll. It is like you win 3 games then you loose 5 games.<//text>< Pictures>

If I could give this game 0 stars I would. I loved this game from Season 2 but the coding gets worse, the community gets worse, and riots "solution" to fix the issue is non existent.</text>

<Text>I have a few old work colleagues who now work for Riot Games, when attending Siggraph I was invited down for a tour and it was fantastic. The studio environment and location are fantastic, very modern and themed around their infamous IP League of Legends.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb147c58ab95:0xd27aa3a914d492b4</Gmap_id>< Pics>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>All the positive reviews on how great it's to work at Riot. Well, of course it's great, because Riot haven't done anything new or groundbreaking since the introduction of their game. It's just a money grab company now. As Riot says,"the hype is real," but unfortunately the substance isn't. Their casters try so hard to hype up a region, but contradicts themselves when asked about their supposed "hype" region during major tournaments. If you're going to lie, at least be consistent. League is not about the e-sport scene, but rather, e-ntertainment...if any at that. The teams are paid by Riot, and the events are hosted by Riot, the rules created by Riot...the players are just actors, not sportsmen. The events are just not even believable anymore. The viewership is down drastically; just look at the pics they posted of the viewers for Worlds, it's laughable, no one is watching. And they've done nothing to get rid of the toxic players in the game. As for their so called "pros," they're allowed to be as toxic as they want, with no repercussions, and instead are hyped even more.  In fact, most of the casters for league are toxic themselves! "Reform?" If the prison system can't reform criminals, I doubt Riot can change the behavior of their toxic players. Toxic players spend money, and that's all Rito cares about. LoL is just about updating skins and introducing more "similar" champs, while ignoring any champion balance. It's just one "flavor of the month" meta to the next. Whatever sells skins and champs; with over 130+ champs but only 20 or so champs viable. Over 6 years and the game is still not balanced. It's funny how the founders said they created LoL because of other game developers' disconnect with their game community; yet, we see just how quickly money changes people,  and now they're the ones ignoring the voices of their community. League is dying, and on its last leg. Rito have no one to blame but themselves, for their own greed.</text></record></dataset><record>

Riot is a great host, they have a snack bar with extremely good pricing for what you get and a nice gift shop. Not to mention they put of a good show in between league matches!< /review>

<text>Riot updates frequently but uses an automated system to issue temporary bans because of inability to connect to games caused by the frequent updates.

Any in-game purchases are way over priced.

People constantly leave pre-game lobby's with little penalty unlike their automated system.<//text>< pics>
