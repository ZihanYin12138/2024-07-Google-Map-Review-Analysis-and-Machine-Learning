Very helpful in that they are communicative about issues, call back when they say they will. But, I mailed them my certified original document and they sent it back in a cheap folder that ripped when mailed back. They didn't put any "fragile" stickers, just sent it back in a basic manila envelope. They refuse to compensate because it "didn't happen on their property." But they left me no choice but to mail since walkins are unavailable. Absolutely upset at their uncaring for my original document.<//text>

Ever since being diagnosed with cancer I've had to come here to get help. You'd expect your process to be easy, but it's not. The individuals working under this facility have been rude and very un-informative. The only great visit I had was my first time applying, but that's it. 1/5 visits were good. So 80 percent of my time here was bad!!!< /review>

<Text>I almost defaulted to rating 1 star because, hey, it's the SS office. The guards are super nice. If you visit multiple times they'll greet you. The workers are nice too but some can be seen clearly distraught and you wonder why they took the job if they can't even act like human beings with any decency.<//Text><time>1466189587099<//time><user>109507168956050727427< /user>< name>

Every time, I receive professional and courteous service from the S.S. employees.
It is worth the wait of about 45 minutes, until your number is called.
I highly recommend this location in Anaheim, CA.</review>

Outstanding! I arrived 30 min before opening and there were already about 40 people ahead of me. Even with the crowd, the people were kind and swift.

I recommend going in the morning. By the afternoon, the workers are probably worn out by the many attitudes they've received during the day. This is probably why there are less than satisfied reviews.< /review>

< review>
I went in with no appointment, at 3:30pm and on a Friday. it was a half  full waiting room. so I thought I was gonna be there till 6pm. HOWEVER, the security guards pointed me to the touch screen, self check in, and were shouting the names or numbers being called out to ensure people where hearing them called ( which sounds annoying, but I get how frustrating it would be to miss your call). Generally it was Very helpful especially since there was a rush or calls at the end. I personally didn't have time to finish filling out my Social security card Replacement Form, because I had been called up so quickly. I was helped by a MR. Wood, who was done with my paperwork and was incredibly helpful and even asked questions about if it was for employment (which it was, and I had forgotten to ask if it would work for an employment opportunity) so he provided it with a stamp to verify the date to assist me further. I was so impressed by the quick and thoroughly comprehensive service by Mr. wood and the friendly assistance from the security guards. I Would not mind having to go back to this office if needed. I don't intend to unless necessary but it definitely would not be a dreaded trip. Say in comparison to the Pain of the DMV, or to the bureaucracy and mind numbing boredom of the Emergency room ( yes I listed the places to their descriptions correctly).
So thank you again Mr. Wood, and the security guards that worked 10-27-2017, and Social Security Office for being a government service that finally gets How to be efficient.

if you have a bad visit, maybe you should double check what you need to bring FIRST or be over prepared to answer possible questions designed to keep people from screwing you over, and help keep the service from having to go slow and extract your info that you should have ready and on hand.

By the way I walked in at 3:30 and left exactly at 4pm. when I left the waiting room was near empty. So props. to all staff that day, sorry I don't know your names.</review>

He goes in and gives all of his information. The woman who assisted him made notes and was completely unhelpful mind you he's been waiting hours. My father is a Vietnam vetran and has a tendency to speak very loudly because he can't hear himself. He says several times a security officer would yell at the old people telling them to listen up. Acting as though they were inconveniencing him. Eventually, fed up he asked to see the notes and to speak to a supervisor. He was denied this right. Only after my father asked to see a supervisor A SECURITY GUARD handcuffed my father for talking and taunted him in a private room. He stood so that way the camera could only see my father and would make whispering sounds trying to disprove that he was hard of hearing. Is this how you treat veterans who were in active combat? Is this what America stands for? An old man paying $100 fine for being old and talking to loud? I'm absolutely disgusted and CANNOT wait to bring this to court. It just shows how pathetically run our government is. These people served and worked for a long time the least they could do is treat them with respect. Handcuffing and taunting a veteran is just so low.</Review>< Pictures>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>This was a horrible experience.  The clerk was rude, hostile and discriminatory. In addition the security guards were obnoxious and out of line. Yelling interfering and violating privacy. I have been going there for years, and while clerks have been rude before, never like this one. The security guards have never behaved like this in all the years i have gone there. They are from paragon security and I will be filing complaints with their supervisors and going to court if necessary. I have already  filed an initial complaint with Soc Security and will be going to the justice dept and an attorney. There is something very wrong at this office beyond the usual bureaucratic dysfunction.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd62d3a8cc341:0x2c0c454fa08d1831< /Gmap_id><rating>1</rating>< Date>

I went for the first time and the SECURITY GARDS ARE DISRESPECTFUL for any reason they like to nag. I went with my kids and they complain about going out to much and told me to stay in or stay out when i only had done it twice. My children were watching my phone and apparently it was loud and asked to put it away. The restroom smelled disgusting !!! The workers otherwise are really helpful but SECURITY has to take a chill pill</Text>

I think this people are great they get you in and out they don't mess around. the security gaurd is very nice man. And don't ask him no question cause he don't know nothen. "It says on the t.v. and they have it posted it up. N e whoo. Turn down your cell phones and no talking on the phone. And if you don't want your purses checked leave them at home. Rules and security purposes also holds up the line.<//Text>

In a strip mall with easy parking.  It's no frills and the interior is basic linoleum.

I've tried every sandwich (except sardines) and it's very consistent.  I wished they used better meat and much better bread but they are watching their costs.  For $3 or $4 I understand.  They seem to be the only place in town for a Vietnamese sandwich?

They do have a fairly high minimum for using debit cards.< /text>

The Vietnamese Sandwiches rolls were pretty good. The breads were slight baked, so it made they even more tasty. Although the picture shown seemed longer. It's not stuffed as other stores. The Vietnamese coffee was thick and good but, same as the sandwiches, rather small amount.<//text>

So as of today i no longer can say i really enjoy this restaurant which saddens me. The original people who ran this business no longer work there, they are gone. So the place may look nicer inside but, it isn't fast anymore. Like it takes forever for you to get a simple iced tea. As for the food it doesn't have the same taste and the bread isn't as light, fluffy, or crunchy (like when u bite into the bread). Instead it is soggy and saturated with some new dark sauce. In my opinion this ruins the whole sandwich, even when the meat and veggies taste good. So i may go there one more time to see if they've been able to get back on track but, if not then this place with meet it's evident death.<//Text>

They forgot to mention that they charge around 28% on those $3 dollar sandwiches... Just bought two $3 sandwich with nothing extra and paid $7.68. Decide for yourself if it's worth going there.</Review>

Must be new owners. Sandwiches are less flavorable and now too spicy to go with that non flavored chicken. Thai Tea had no flavor. Mist be new owners, never coming back to my used to be fav place Lido Sandwiches :-(<//Text>

So, to be fair, this is one of those instances where you don't do better until you know better (or in this case-tasted better). I thought the price was outstanding for the sandwich I received. However, I found that every time I would order the bread was so hard it would scrape the top of my mouth. Very uncomfortable, but I thought, " Hey, maybe this is how banh mi sandwiches are supposed to be". Then each time I went I would ask for extra jalapeño. They would say okay sure, but I noticed a hesitation. When I got home there would be no extra and what's worse, I don't think they were using fresh ingredients because the "jalapeños" were sweet not spicy. I even had to confirm that they were jalapeños. Anyway, the sandwiches got soggier on the inside and harder on the outside. I finally tried Mai Banh Mi in Oakland. OH MY GOD. There's a sandwich! I only eat the vegetarian but the tofu was so much more flavorful, the bread was crisp and soft at the same time. The jalapeños were fresh, even the cabbage tasted better. That's that on that. Peace out Loving Tea, stay blessed.< /review>

<name>Taylor N<//name><Time>1621040371296< /Time><Rating>1</Rating><Text>For our military households and beyond- I would not recommend the tax services of Renae Wallace. We had a simple W2 tax return, what would have been any tax preparer’s dream. We claimed no children, no dependents, no rental properties, no schedules, and no statements on our returns. What should have been a 10 minute preparation turned into a 3 hour appointment leading into an amendment needed to be done, turned into multiple visits because Renae could not get it right. I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed, but it was somehow “COVID’s fault” and “new guidelines changing”. Absolutely unacceptable. Our file was taken over by the district manager who also agreed this return should’ve been done within 10 minutes, correctly the first time. I highly recommend Lori Pocco at the El Cajon branch over this place. Never again.</Text>< pictures>

Thank you Renae you are amazing and I'll be a loyal coustomer for as long as you choose to do taxes. I highly recommend this location staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Renae explained everything and made me feel comfortable with the whole processes. They have many ways to help you out and work with you. If you have question they make themselves aviable to answer. I'm a very happy coustoner. Tax season is stressful enough and Renae has made it so easy I had no time to stress.< /text>

I really enjoy the wonderful rapport I have with Stephen, my tax professional--he's incredibly sharp and knowledgeable and makes the process as painless as possible. I also love that I have no problem securing an appointment each year; easy as can be! On top of that--Kim, the manager on site at the Fletcher Parkway location that day, was absolutely a delight and was incredibly helpful when Stephen and I had questions.</text>

Absolutely fantastic experience. Everyone was very helpful with my unique problems. The price was fair and everyone seemed genuine and honest. Aaron is the man, I am relieved that I found my new repair shop!<//Text>

<rating>2<//rating><Time>1550135095815< /Time><review>Buyer beware! Tried selling my wife $800 worth of brakes when it only needed pads. Scared her claiming 'metal to metal.' To me metal to metal is down to the rivets on the pads and the corresponding groove on the rotor....uhmmmm duh? Some brake pads have metal tabs to indicate by a scraping sound  that you should have your brakes looked at. Was close, but brakes were quiet. Rotors were clean. Would they have admit that and drop the price down? Tell me I need pads and if my rotors are bad show me. Have them show you the problem or get a second opinion. May have been the sales guy but shops like this make me mad. 2 stars for prior  'decent' service. Unless I just didn't realize I got ripped off! Makes me question it.</review><UserId.>105199283841856181295<//UserId.>< resp>
{'time': 1550258422087, 'text': 'Mr. Talavera\nFirst I would like to apologize for the experience you had. We tried to be very thorough and visibly showed your wife everything recommended so she could explain it to you. We discussed with your wife that she can save some money if you did the work. As long as it gets done she will be fine. The right front inner brake pad was less than 1/2 of a mm. the r/r inner brake pad was a little under 1mm. Brake pads are recommended at 3mm and anything under 1mm is specified as "at metal". Brake pads do not have rivets like brake shoes and if the pads get past 1mm the caliper is at risk of the piston coming out too far and ceasing. The brake rotors had a lip and there was not enough material to be machined. Although the rotor was clean and smooth it would be below the discard spec. The manufacturer recommends to replace the brake pads and rotors for BMW , Mercedes, Fiat, Mini Cooper and Audi for all brake replacements with no recommendations for resurfacing. When performing all other  brake jobs the brake rotors need to be either machined or replaced, a "pad slap" is highly discouraged due to brake noise and possible failure due to the rotors being too thin. The manufacturer has rotor discard specifications to ensure safety. If a rotor has a lip at the edge the rotor is below its machine spec and needs  be replaced. We gave your wife a quote for brake pads and rotors for the front and the rear for $715.90+tax and optional brake fluid flush for $89.95. This is an average price for a complete brake job including rotors for the front and rear, we also included our front brake service coupon. We have been in business for 30 years and our integrity is the most important thing we have. Our employees do not make commission because we want any recommendation we make to be purely on facts and one of the biggest compliments we get is that we will tell you if the repair can wait for another oil change, if it is purely for preventative maintenance or if it is a safety concern. Our customers are our #1 priority. Once again Rod, I apologize for the experience you had but we do not use "scare tactics". I took your wife into the shop to show her exactly why the recommendations were made and we discussed ways to keep the price down. You and your wife are my customers and I want to keep you safe, make your vehicle last and save as much money as I can for you.  I hope all is well. God Bless\n\nMichael Martinez\nGeneral Manager\nPetrillo\'s Tire and Auto Inc.'}< /resp>

They did not tell me on the phone several things which would have changed my mind about going there.  First, you had to wait outside if you were waiting for your car due to Covid.  It is 108 degrees outside with three fires burning in the area.  Second, they did not accept anything but a credit card.  No checks,  no cash. They called and told me I needed a new air filter, I said no.  I get that ever time I get an oil change.
They did offer a ride home but who wants to get in a strange car with a stranger?  Not me.
I have more work to be done on my vehicle but I will go to Les Schwabs.  Very disappointed as this is a AAA service center.</text>

Dont go here for Brake & Lamp inspections. Was quoted over 300 for parts my car didnt need. When I asked the guy to point out where do those parts go on the vehicle that he wanted to order he couldnt point it out. Then they failed me on a brake and lamp inspection because a bulb was out on a taillight which was a quick change out in 1 minute to fix the problem and because I didnt have my fog lights connected on a aftermarket bumper. Then was told i would have to pay the 165 again for another inspection after I connect the foglights. Avoid this place. Go to Fairfield for brake and lamp inspections.<//review>

Excellent service, I had an issue with the quality of the brakes that were placed in the front of my vehicle, I came back two weeks later and they replaced everything with better quality products, no charge. I was impressed with the people upfront and how they handled everything, also with the quality of the work. Good people all around.< /Review>

I came here on a Wednesday morning and waited 2 1/2 hours for mounting a balancing four tires + a smog check. Otherwise it’s a nice shop, they take care of you if there is an issue.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<username>robert myers<//username><Date>1544761357305</Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>My vehicle would not pass smog, so I wen tin for a diagnostics check and was told I would need a new air pump. This sounded reasonable as it was the most likely problem. I almost dropped the phone when the customer service rep told me it would cost $771 with parts and labor.

I am not a mechanic, but after a very brief amount of research, I was able to find the part in town for $133. I then found a video on youtube and was able to remove the old part and install the new one in 32 minutes.

After saving $638 by doing the job myself, I was left wondering why Petrillos felt the need to quote me so much for such a simple job. I came to the conclusion that they are either incompetent or dishonest. I will never use their services again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80853d540d988101:0x3d8c693054152664</gmap_id></record>

<username>Anthony Hunter<//username><text>I'm guessing it was the owner who I dealt with. Not friendly from the onset, never bothered to tell me how long it may be, basically walked away without even making eye contact.

I brought in a $17.25 coupon from a competitor in Fairfield. Petrillos charges $19.95. I said "I have this coupon I don't know if you price match but if not I have this one from the same booklet for you guys at $20." He said "no we don't do that" as he looked down.

I sit down no more than 10 feet from them. It's a small waiting area. He then says this to the other guy up front:

Going to call them owner (O) and worker (W):

O -  "They're $17.25 at this place in Fairfield for smog."

W - "Oh yeah?"

O - Yeah. Just so you guys know we don't match prices. You know why?"

W - "Why's that?"

O - "Because if they want that price then go to Fairfield ok? This is Vacaville. So don't accept these for price matching."

W - "Oh I know!! Trust me I know! I'm not accepting those"

Honestly was taken aback how rude and unprofessional he was. And over what, $2.70? You'll never find me coming here again.

And trust me, I'll take my business to Fairfield, or anywhere else for that matter when I am on the market to buy new aftermarket wheels and tires later this year. You lost a customer over your unprofessionalism. Hope that $2.70 was worth it.</text>< GmapID>

<Text>In 6 months, I’ve taken my two vehicles back on multiple occasions to have their work re-addressed; or discovered their work did not fix the issue. Or left a vehicle with them for 36 hours to find out they didn’t have the right parts, qualified technicians, and resources to do the job.

Three separate repairs totaling $3,000+ to fix some clicking/noises in the front end, and the noises are still present. During this process, I had to return the vehicle 20 miles after a strut mount change due to severe rattle.

$600+ for two transmissions seals, one of which shows new evidence of leaking after only 1200 miles. A mile after the initial repair, I had to bring it back to them due to high revving, gear slipping, and burning odors. The technician did not service enough transmission fluid after the seal replacement.

They charge $125 per hour for labor, which is certainly the high range in the local area. If you’re going to pay that rate, find a reputable mechanic who double-checks their work.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I just needed my temperature gauge replaced . They told me I had to have a diagnostic check first which cost almost 100.00. Then told me to come down to have it checked out. When I got there, the guy I spoke to who was friendly was on the phone so another guy reluctantly helped me but he was rude, dismissive and not helpful.  So I went across the street to Aaron's automotive.</text>

My truck wouldn't stay running. Had it towed to Petrillo's.They couldn't find anything wrong with it. They talked me into changing the fuel pump, filter, and relay for preventive maintenance. This cost me $883.74. The next time it wouldn't start I had it towed in again. This time they told me it was the pass lock sensor. They charged me another $647.37. I don't think the fuel pump, filter or relay were needed in the first place. They can't even be sure that this will fix the problem.</review>

<text>We had a wonderful experience at Petrillo's.  The people there are so incredibly knowledgeable. They aren't a HARD sell.  They give you all the information to make an informed decision and then go from there.  Their staff is bar-none the friendliest we've ever dealt with.  Let's face it, buying tires is NOT something anyone enjoys doing.  The owner Mike Petrillo runs a clean, tight ship and we would go back there for all of our automotive needs.  Thank you everyone at Petrillo's for all of your help.<//text>< pictures>

We brought our 1994 Ford Ranger in for it's first service in 6 years. New plugs, wires, oil, etc. Thing runs like a champ. Even got the tires rotated. I've seen discussions about price... All I can say is we were in and out of there rapidly after just walking in without an appointment. The service was quality. You can always "just get it done" at any tune-n-lube by untrained personnel, or you can have quality work done by locally owned professional shop.
I'm putting my money back into the community in which I live.< /Text>

<review>Will never go there again nor will I recommend to anyone ever again. When in for a specific problem took car back 3 days in a row with same problem after driving from shop home each time they just kept telling me it was something else. The manager was rude to my fiancé and spoke to me with an attitude. This place is a joke and a scam!! Only gave 1 Star because I had to put something I wouldn’t give a star at all after this experience. I hope the owner responds to this like he did in the other negative reviews cuz when I asked to speak to the manager he gave me attitude and when I asked for the owner I was told he hasn’t been seen there in weeks. Just poor service period</review><Rating>1< /Rating><user>108268575144091213094</user><gmapID>0x80853d540d988101:0x3d8c693054152664</gmapID>< Pictures>

The team at Petrillo's tires was great. They made a mistake and did everything they could to correct and resolve the issue. If you want a place that gives great service, and stands by there work, this is the place to go. Thank you Petrillo's team for holding yourselves to a high standard.<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Took my truck to get smogged (California requirement) at a place on Aegean Way in Vacaville. They wanted $39.99 plus $8.25 Certificate fee - that would be $48.20. It has to be tested at a STAR station (used to be smog only test station). Dropped it off and walking to get something to eat I noticed a sign at Petrillo's that indicated they were also a STAR smog test station that would do it for $19.95 plus certificate, so I went back and got my key and took my truck there. Got it tested for only $28.20! A difference of $20.00. Is there some kind of crooked business practices going on here? Is one place getting a little too much profit? Anyone in Vacaville getting their car/truck/other vehicle smog tested - I recommend Petrillo's!< /text><Date>1369869876647<//Date><UserId.>102920594460431438907< /UserId.><user_name>Howard Goldstein< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Jeff from Guthrie and Sons was very professional, extremely helpful, and made the process of checking on Heating and AC condensers very easy! I highly recommend this company for friendly and knowledgable service who can come out fairly quickly as well. It was very refreshing to schedule an appointment so quickly and I'm very excited to use them again.<//review>

From the estimate to the installation, i could not be more happier. The estimator/owner came out and exuded confidence about solving our problem. Several other vendors offered solutions of putting a heater on the roof, while  others suggested putting a heater in the house - that would take up some of the closet space. Not only did they provide a viable and less intrusive solution, but the PRICE WAS RIGHT!  Please look no further and get an estimate from Mr. Guthrie; he will not disappoint.

Oh and one more thing...  They removed an old air conditioner from the roof for FREE!  These folks far exceeded my expectations!<//text>

He couldn’t have been better!  He did a thorough job. Very conscious of pandemic protocol with the addition of booties over his shoes!  He addressed all of our minor concerns and answered our questions thoroughly.  Excellent service provider.  He is exceptional.<//text>

Guthrie and sons were recommended to me by my grandson. He has use them for repairs and maintenance. The heating system  stopped working (25+ yrs old). I called and Joe (wearing a mask and paper boots) came out to check out the problem. He came back and installed a new system,  Joe was polite, placed canvas down to protect my floors and vacuumed the area when finished. I would definitely call them again and recommend Guthrie and Sons and Joe to family and friends.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>We had our entire duct system replaced and new UV and i-wave filtering system installed. The installation crew was really great. They were knowledgeable, and went over things in detail--asking about any options in terms of placement of vents, etc. They worked in a very clean and organized manner, and remove not only the old ducts, but all sorts of trash that had accumulated in the crawl space over the years. I give them my highest recommendation.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Guthrie and Sons was the best choice for my HVAC project. Matt recommended the perfect system for my home. Cost efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and fantastic performance. Phil and Rob were the best install team I could have asked for. They arrived on time, took care of my home while they worked, were friendly, and ensured I understood each part of the procedure, before and after. Thank you all for your hard work!<//Review>

Our Furnace went out December. Having worked with Guthrie & Sons before, we called them and they sent Zach out right away.  He did a great job diagnosing the problem, and showing us (with pictures) what we would be dealing with down the line.  We wanted to replace our out of date ac unit anyway.  Zach explained what the different levels offered were, and what financing was available.  He did not try to pressure or upsell us.  The next week, Phil came and installed everything, including a new thermostat.  He did a great job installing the new systems, and was very thorough in putting things back the way he found them.  He made sure to answer all our questions.<//Text>

Zach, our technician, was excellent. He kept us informed as to what he was doing. He showed my husband how to replace the air filter since it wasn't very dirty this time. We had service at the end of the season last time.

Zach even showed us how to install a new thermostat so we didn't have to pay extra for him to install it. Then, Zach went above and beyond to help us cut back some ivy that had gotten out of control in our jade plants.

We have used Guthrie & Sons since at least 2016 and have always had great service.  We will continue to use them too.</Review>

<text>My electrician of 20 years recommended Gutherie & Sons recently when my gas heater was acting wonky. The office team was helpful and my service tech Jeff was great. Jeff answered all my questions thoughtfully and thoroughly explained options. I’d happily recommend Gutherie & Sons to friends and family and to you too!<//text><user>103744579913881548186< /user><Time>1610957748215<//Time><username>Y H< /username><rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x80deaaf029313541:0xe4f64cae78ec6f8f</Gmap_id>< resp>

Zack was very polite, professional, and knowledgeable. Furthermore, he  was able to clearly explain what he was doing and was able to quickly troubleshoot the problem with my furnace, which looked like the inside of a computer. I would highly recommend Zack for any heater repairs you may need.</Text>

Technician (Zach) did a great job diagnosing and fixing the heater problem - gaps around furnace base that could allow products of combustion to mix with circulating air. He explained it well and then took care of the problem! Great work! Reasonable prices. I would recommend Guthrie to others.<//review>

Zach and his partner Jeff arrived early and assessed the issue with my Rheem A/C after a few tests. They were both friendly and professional and very familiar with knowing what needed to be done and how to do it.

My A/C was not turning on. In the middle of a heat wave, my kids schooling at home and my wife working remotely, I had contacted another service company to come out sooner. They were not contracted with Rheem but another brand I never heard of. After two hours, they finally told me that the part I needed was no longer available. They could not get my A/C working and offered to install a new system for thousands of dollars!

Zach and Jeff had my A/C working in less than 30 minutes! The repair charge was very reasonable and included two future service calls in the next 12 months.

I highly recommend Guthrie and Sons and chose them because they were referred on the Rheem website for Rheem local contractors. Thank you Zach and Jeff!</Review>

<text>Always professional and fair prices. Even during the pandemic, the employees were polite, clean and wore masks. The employees are always very knowledgeable and explain what they do and show you what they are replacing or repairing. I have used them several times now and have been satisfied every visit. They can usually fix things on the spot and beat out ever other quote I get.< /text>< response>

Zach provided the level of service that you would ask for. He texted me when he was in his way, brought his own booties to wear in the house, took and texted photos of the HVAC equipment in my attic, did the maintenance in an efficient, professional manner, and was warm and friendly.  I, Ken Barovsky, highly recommend Guthrie & Sons. I know you’ll get the same level of service I got from Zach!!</Text>

<text>Can't say enough about the friendly, professional, reliable service standards maintained by Guthrie & Sons. Jeff B. did the annual heating system inspection / service, and filter replacement. It was a very pleasant contact and experience, that provides us with the confidence that our gas furnace is in tip-top condition.< /text>< user>

<Text>Guthrie and Sons came to my aid quickly when I was in need of assistance with my AC unit. They were incredibly efficient, professional, and a pleasure to do business with. Zack and Tim were very informative as to what issues were, and explained clearly so that I could understand what was happening. They acted with honesty, reliability, and expertise.  There were no surprises, and I felt informed and comfortable throughout the process.  I’m so relieved!  Just in time for 90+ degree weather. I whole heartedly recommend this company for all of your HVAC needs.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have been using Guthrie & Sons Heating and Air since I moved to San Diego over 10 years ago now . When I later relocated to the far north county area I was happy they served customers that far away. They’re always on time, professional and reasonable on price. What else could anybody ask for?< /review>

I have worked with Guthrie & Sons for years and they are always courteous and professional and provide great value and service.  We have purchased a Furnace and A/C units through them and they work great.  We also do their 2x/year service to keep everything running smoothly.  I highly recommend these guys and our service today with Adam was pleasant, professional and efficient.  Great guy!< /review>

From first to last, this company was outstanding.  Amy, Courtney and Jessie in the office; Zach in sales; Jimmy , Bill and their helper- all friendly and capable.  Jimmy even stayed an hour after my furnace was installed to help me feel comfortable with the unit.  The heater works great and I highly recommend this company.  Thank you all!< /review>

<Text>I found Guthrie and Sons through an internet search because I needed someone to fix a wall heater in an apartment I rent out. They scheduled an appointment quickly, came on time, and met with the tenant. While still there the technician called and said "I have good news." He reported that he found a simple problem with the heater, but it required someone with expertise to know about an obscure switch that had been accidentally turned off. I was very happy that I did not have to replace the whole heater. But when he said it was so simple he was not even going to charge me for the visit, I almost dropped my phone! I didn't think that kind of relationship-building with businesses happened anymore. He explained they are a family-owned company, and their reputation is important. So, of course, they have a customer for life with me, and I fully expect to call them when my needs fits their expertise. I was so surprised and appreciative of their great service, I wanted to share my story publicly.<//Text><response>{'time': 1579044427726, 'text': "Jim, we couldn't have been happier to help!

Our heater was not working and a prior company had recommended a complete replacement for a couple thousands dollars... my handyman referred us to Guthrie for a second opinion and he came promptly the very next day and diagnosed a small part replacement need and fixed it in 5 minutes for less than $200. He performs an honest and accurate job and we are so grateful for his work!! Highly highly recommended!!</review>

<Text>This company was wonderful to work with!  On one of the hottest days in San Diego our AC unit was making strange sounds. We were afraid it was going to go out on us and we knew we needed someone to look at it immediately. . We called around and no one was able to help us that day although they said in their ads same day service.  When we  finally found Gunthrie and Sons We gave them a call and told them we needed someone to look at our unit ASAP.  We were relieved when they said they were able to send someone out To our home later that day.  Zack arrived and he was kind , on time, honest and very knowledgeable He didn’t find any major mechanical issues but pointed out our unit was low on refrigerant and our AC could have been  overworking itself. After he put in coolant and replaced our old filters the AC is working smooth as can be and is keeping the house comfortably cool. It is a wonderful thing when someone not only does a great job but is honest and pleasant to work with! .  Thanks again Gunthrie and Sons and esp Zack!  We highly recommend this awesome local business.  Lisa and Jack Altmann, San Diego, CA</Text>< Time>

They were professional in their dealings with us.  Always kept us informed throughout the installation process and finished earlier than their original estimate.  We haven’t used our new  mini-split system much because the weather has been mild and pleasant but I’m sure there will be no problem with using the system for our comfort needs.  Thank you, Guthrie & Sons for a job well done.  You are the best!<//review>

Excellent service and a successful diagnostic and quick, reasonable repair. So happy.

<Text>Technician (Zachery) was on time, courteous and professional.  The AC problem was quickly diagnosed as a clogged drain that caused the system shutdown.  Drain was cleared and service restored.  Air Intake Filter was changed and external condenser unit was also washed.  Thanks to Zach and courteous help from Courtney in arranging the same day trouble call visit.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Had Guthrie & Sons install a mini-split AC system at a house in San Diego. From estimate process with Zack to installation with Jeremy they were very responsive and did great work. When I was deciding what system to go with Zack patiently explained all my options (and there are a lot when it comes to AC systems.)  I never got the sense that Guthrie & Sons was trying to upsell me to a bigger or more expensive system than was needed for the house. Jeremy the lead installer did a thorough walkthrough with me when the job was done and explained how the system worked. Jeremy and his install crew also completely cleaned up the jobsite inside and out when the work was complete. Would definitely use Guthrie again.<//Review>

<review>Jimmy and Mike installed new ductwork in my house. They were very professional and did a nice job with the work. Prior to the job starting they walked through the process with me and made sure we were clear on scope. The install went very smoothly and they did a nice job of cleaning up all the spaces they worked in. At the end they made sure I understood how everything worked and followed up on all my questions. This was the second time I have used this company and will continue to use them for future projects. Their quality and customer service cannot be beat.<//review>< Pics>

On time, pleasant tech, did not leave a mess. Good experience overall.

We've been using Guthrie for heating and air conditioning repair and maintenance and the have always done a good job for a reasonable price.

Oops, left out the "not" in the mess comment - sorry.< /Text>

Excellent Customer Service and Quality Installation. I have been using G&S to service our home's HVAC systems for three years now and have been thoroughly impressed. Their customer service is incredible - everyone who has ever been here to do either an inspection, an installation, or a checkup has been kind, prompt (so valuable!), patient, and thorough. I cannot recommend them highly enough.</text>

<Review>This is the second time they have been to our home. Last year they installed the air conditioning in our upstairs. Wayne and the rest of the crew were friendly,  professional and knew their profession. It was installed perfectly.  The arrived at their scheduled time and finished in a timely manner. Everything was left clean and we had them back a couple of weeks ago to install A/C in the main house. As before, we requested Wayne again and we were so pleased with their professionalism. We highly recommend Githrie and Sons for all your A/C repairs or installation. Thank you again!

Friendly family owned company with great service! UPDATE 8/27 - Sean came out today to do an annual AC checkup and did a thorough and fantastic job! He even went the extra mile and adjusted the compressor so it wasn't so loud. I highly recommend Sean and G&S Heating and Air!</Text>

<review>I have always been pleased with my experiences with Guthrie and Sons, and today was no exception. Wayne called before he arrived, was very courteous and wore booties in my house, and explained what he would be doing and then what his recommendations were in a manner that I could understand.

Good Service.  Zach put covers on his shoes and made sure everything was great.  Only recommendation I have is company gives people like Zach some gloves for their hands to open attic covers so they do t have to go back and try to wipe them clean.  I appreciate his friendliness and superior service!</text>

<review>They came to the house on time and gave a thorough estimate for furnace replacement.   Their price was very reasonable.   Two technicians did the installation a few days later.   They were polite and did a great job on the installation,  including modifying the base to support the new furnace.  They cleaned the room thoroughly when they finished.   The new furnace and thermostat work perfectly.  We are totally satisfied.< /review><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

We were very happy with the service we received from Guthrie for the installation of our new HVAC last year.  Everyone was very nice and professional.  Communication was great during the installation.  The owner even came out to check on the installation and recommended a smaller unit for our home.  He was able to get the new unit sent out and installed the same day.  We have been very happy with our new HVAC.

We had gotten a number of quotes on our own, then our neighbor recommended Guthrie to us. Very happy they did!<//Text>

We think that Guthrie and Sons did an outstanding job on our AC replacement.  Andrew is knowledgeable and highly competent - both men were - and they worked diligently to perform the job.  There was a glitch with an interface board that failed after installation and system checkout, but Guthrie responded quickly and corrected the issue.  We both think that the new system is a significant improvement, and we are very happy with the outcome.  We highly recommend Guthrie and Sons.< /text>

Gold standard for customer service. Amy got me scheduled quickly and confirmed the day before via text and email. Nick called to say he was on the way. Arrived on time. Got the service done quickly. Wore booties and took the trash with him. Paid by cc. No issues. Will recommend to friends and family!< /Text>

Everything was top notch from the beginning of the sales process all of the way through install and permit.  The family owned business is full of employees and owners that truly care about doing a great job for their customers.  They were warm, personable and professional.  I was having an issue after install with my upstairs not being cooled as much as downstairs due to how old my home's internal system is (1977).  One of the owners spent an entire day trying to get it to be equal and he succeeded.  He could have simply told me that it was just how the house was built but he didn't, he was committed to making sure that I was as comfortable as he could possibly make me.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone who is about to make this type of investment in their home!

Thanks Guys!<//Text>

Yesterday we had Guthrie & Sons replace our air/heat and  we have nothing but good to things to say about the units and the service. Nik and Blake were on time, efficient and we are enjoying our new heat/air. We've been customers since March of 2011 and we have been satisfied with the customer service since then. Every employee we have met so far have been professional and also very personable. My wife and I enjoy them having them in our homes. We both highly recommend Guthrie & Sons to anyone looking for an heating and air company.<//review>

One of the owners spent an entire day trying to get it to be equal and he succeeded.  He could have simply told me that it was just how the house was built but he didn't, he was committed to making sure that I was as comfortable as he could possibly make me.
I would highly recommend this company to anyone who is about to make this type of investment in their home!

Thanks Guys!<//Text>

Excellent service and amazing team. Zach was the technician who came out and he did an amazing job both time's he's been here.  The first was to fix my heating system and the second was for a quarterly check-up that Guthrie offers as a package.  Zach went above and beyond showing me what everything was and explaining what he was doing and even answering all of my questions which I'm sure made him feel like he was being tested.  He was great with a big smile the whole time.  I'd highly recommend this company to anyone looking for someone to take care of your heating and air systems.< /Review>

I had a very good experience with this company. The crew was on time and very professional. They protected the floors and cleaned up before leaving. They were friendly to me when I spoke to them. They only spoke about the task on hand to each other which I appreciated. The mini split system seems to be working fine. The price was lower then a major competitor. I would recommend  Guthrie & Sons for your heating & air needs.</Review>

<text>I needed to replace my 23-year-old HVAC system, and had numerous bids. I chose Guthrie & Sons because their pricing was very competitive (even Costco!), they had great reviews, and I like to support local companies.  Best decision I ever made.  The office personnel are friendly and helpful, and the installers (Blake and Luke) were amazing!  I’ve had some dreadful experiences with contractors, but these guys were the BEST!   Professional, knowledgeable, respectful, and cleaned up at the end of the day, like you never even knew they were there.  Highly, highly recommend!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1525191881003, 'text': 'Thank you so much for sharing your experience Janet!

<text>Everyone I met was friendly and professional. We were given several different options at various prices, and their bid was much better than the two others we got.
One of the owners did the initial evaluation and drew up an estimate, and assured us he personally would return after completion of the job to make sure it was done correctly and that we were satisfied. He was true to his word, and the minor changes were made a few days later.
I'm happy to recommend Guthrie and Sons!<//text></record>

First, it is the lower price quote. And the quote is very detail with model number so that I can search on the manufacture website to understand what product I am actually getting and it is easier for me to complete with other quote (from other company). When I have questions about the product, they are very patient to answer me. The installation is scheduled very smooth. The office called back to confirm with day and time. The installer show up on time, professional job, done in five hours. The inspector come the next day, also very polite and finish the inspection. Then I pay with credit card. The city inspector come two days later with a little suggestion that Guthrie and Sons can do for me (close the hole from the outside wall). I called Guthrie and Sons, they come the next day to fix it. Again, very polite and professional. I love my AC  and ready for the summer!< /review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Text>Totally professional from first contact with the sales representative to completion of the installation. The installers arrived exactly on time. Andrew and Taylor were both easy to work with and pleasant to have in our home. There were no hidden costs or surprises and the price was the most competitive of several estimates. I most strongly recommend Guthrie and Sons if you need to install a Heating and Air Conditioning System.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Guthrie and Sons installed a central heating system in my home, replacing the 1970's wall heater, and later installed a mini split system AC unit for the bedroom. On both occasions the work done was timely and efficient, and I would highly recommend them!</Text>

I have had intermittent issues with my HVAC heating oil pressure switch for years now.  Zach is the first tech to know exactly and with certainty where the problem was and how to fix it. Over the past 5+ years I had at least at least 4 others techs who had no clue what the issue was.

The worst part is it seemed to have the highest failure rate when it was really cold so we wouldn't get any heat.  It is finally fixed and took less than 15 minutes once he had the part in hand.

I highly recommend Zach and Guthrie and Sons.  I will be using them for all my heating and cooling issues in the future.

THANKS Zach!!!< /Text>

Very nice people to work with. They did an excellent job installing my new system, and the service checks they  perform since it was installed are very good. When I signed the contract to have them install the unit, they told me it would probably cut my electric bill in half and they were right. Just had a service check-up and everything is working as it should. Keep up the good work Guthrie and sons.< /text>

I have yet to use my brand new central air and heat system but so far everything with this company is perfect.  They're sales team was on time, friendly, and professional.  They worked with me on financing options and got the price to an amount with a monthly payment I could afford.  The install team showed up right on time, completed the job quickly, and cleaned up after themselves.  They got my job done in a day and a half- completely new duct work, central air and heat.  I am so happy I chose Guthrie and Sons.  Just FYI, I paid 10,000 less than what another hvac quoted me for same type of system.< /review>

We are 100% satisfied with the quality of work, service, & communication from them!  After researching ac companies on yelp, I decided to get bids from ASI & Guthrie.  I ended up choosing Guthrie because of how impressed I was with Joe the sales person.  He was a really nice guy, and did a great job explaining my installation & pricing options.

If you are reading this review, it means that you are thinking of investing a lot of money in something important for your home.  Contact Guthrie!  You will be very happy that you did.  Good luck!< /Review><user>117250126241311489985< /user>< rating>

< Review>
Guthrie & Sons Heating & Air Conditioning is a reliable company we recently used to trouble shoot a furnace at one of the properties we manage. We had trouble locating keys for the first scheduled appointment and the Guthrie & Son's team graciously rescheduled our appointment for us just before we were supposed to meet them at the property. Wayne, our technician, was on-time and communicative about the problems we were facing with the furnace and explained to me, someone unfamiliar with furnace workings, what exactly was going on clearly and understandably. Their company representative, Amy, was also extremely communicate and had great customer service. We will definitely be using this company again.</Review>

We just used Guthrie & Sons for the purchase & installation of our new ductless AC unit.  We are 100% satisfied with the quality of work, service, & communication from them!  After researching ac companies on yelp, I decided to get bids from ASI & Guthrie.  I ended up choosing Guthrie because of how impressed I was with Joe the sales person.  He was a really nice guy, and did a great job explaining my installation & pricing options.

If you are reading this review, it means that you are thinking of investing a lot of money in something important for your home.  Contact Guthrie!  You will be very happy that you did.  Good luck!</Review>

<text>I purchased an updated HVAC system from another company and when it was installed I was so blown away that the size of the AC unit was 2x bigger than what I had in my condo for 13 years.

I called Guthrie & Sons Heating & Air Conditioning and asked them if they would give me their opinion and they very nicely did. They told me that the condo builders most likely put in the cheapest unit possible and the 2.5 ton unit installed seems correct.

They seem like a very reputable company and if I could do it again I would have gone with them. Thanks Guthrie!< /text></record>

<rating>5</rating><review>During the peak of the summer and in the middle of a San Diego heat wave, they were able to set an appointment at 1-week when nobody else in San Diego could do less than 3 weeks.

Zach showed up exactly on time and was obviously an expert with a wealth of knowledge and experience. He was able to get my air conditioning cooling like a champ again within an hour. He presented me with 3 options, but actually recommended the least-expensive option and advised me on some services that I would likely need in the future.

I couldn't be happier, and if I ever have trouble I will call them again!!<//review>< pictures>

We have been using Guthrie & Sons for a few years now.  We are set up for routine maintenance; which is a great service they provide. This is an excellent company, family owned, great follow up, very clean, good prices and will continue to use them for all of our heating and air needs.  Zach has been the technician to visit us the last few times and he is great - knowledgeable & personable!!  Thank you G & S!!</Review>

<Text>Was extremely pleased with entire experience using Guthrie and Sons.  Every detail was handled with skill, courtesy, and professionalism; all at a price that meet or beat other quotes we received.

Special thanks to Joe Patrick for patiently answering my questions and accurately assessing our needs and existing system ...without trying to oversell.

Big thanks also to Wayne and Ben for the great job they did with installation.  Their skill and experience were obvious.  They were neat and clean from start to finish, not just in leaving our home & yard tidy, but in the details of the installation itself (e.g., solder joints, duct work, wiring, taping, etc.). I also appreciate how personable & articulate they were in explaining our new system, thermostat, options, etc..

Finally, a shout out to the office & scheduling staff (Amy and ???).  Every call and inquiry was answered quickly, politely, and efficiently.

I can't imagine a better experience.  We've now had our new AC/Heating system a full 3 months and it continues to work superbly and has been completely trouble free.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>I am so happy to have chosen This company for all my a/c and heating needs.  Today, service tech, Wayne came over to check on a possible a/leak.  He determined it may be a outtake plumbing issue.  Wayne didn't even charge me for a $75 service call.  He was more concerned that I call a plumber to get on it.

Many thanks to a great and respected company!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Zach called ahead as promised and showed up right on time.

His inspection was thorough and he suggested adding a sacrificial zinc anode to our air conditioner compressor to eliminate corrosion. It looked just like the zincs I put on the prop shaft of my boat for the same reason.  Thanks Zach!<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>After a less than desirable experience with another HVAC company, it was clear from the first 30 seconds on the phone with the operator that I was going to likely have a very positive experience with Guthrie and Sons.  My expectations were exceeded each step of the way.  From the operator to the technician (both were extremely nice and knowledgeable) to the nearly immediate emails following the service with a receipt and also asking for feedback, positive or negative.  Clearly the owner/owners of the company care about customer service.  Highly recommend of course.</Review>< pics>

The company sent us a picture of Chuck  and his assistant Taylor a couple of days before our installation date. Chuck called us an hour before he and his partner were to  arrive.  Both Chuck and Taylor were friendly and efficient. They made efforts to avoid making a mess. The heating unit they installed works perfectly, and we are very pleased with a our warm house< /Text>

I had my A/C unit tuned-up today.  This is the kind of company you are not even sure still exists today.  Friendly service, on time, no glitches or errors, a close-knit bunch who work really hard and are proud of the level of education they have in the HVAC business and the service they provide.  I bought my new furnace / A/C unit from then 1.5 years ago and they do not miss a beat.  I feel my investment is in good hands and they will not up-sell me or tell tales about competitors.  Furthermore, they care about each other as colleagues.  Zach is very patient, laughs easily and is pleasant to be around.  But he also knows his stuff.  Ask for him!< /review>

November 13 - Adam just came by to do the fall inspection of our heater. He did a thorough job and took the explain what he did for us. He even went above and beyond by reattaching insulation and ductwork.  I'm so glad we got our heater and air conditioning through them.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>These guys are great- constant communication about the appointment and a phone call from the technician when was 15 minutes away. Zack, the technician, came by and did some trouble shooting of my heating system- he even allowed me to tag along and bother him with a million questions. In no time the furnace was online. Thanks a bunch- will use these guys again.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Extraordinarily friendly and expert service.  Together, these guys can do anything.  For the last several years I’ve been making a wish-list of every imaginable feature, and Guthrie and Sons built us a dream HVAC system that’s quiet, technologically advanced, efficient, and very powerful when needed.  And it’s almost invisible except for the beautiful thermostats (Honeywell’s latest advanced color touchscreen) that I can control from my cell phone.  (And they can manage humidity as well as temperature.)  Nest thermostat is available, too.  I knew that our home would be a very challenging retrofit, but Joe had some great ideas and Matt Guthrie is brilliant at assembling the various myriad components on paper, and designing efficient fluid airflow systems for difficult structures.  Having an actual engineer like Matt design your duct system is a tremendous value, and he’s a great communicator.  Our central air system now has 3 distinct zones that we can control independently, while filtering (via ultraviolet light and media) air throughout all 3 zones.  It’s really an “air-quality” system, as Honeywell says, because the air filtration system makes a huge difference!  Every level of our house is the exact same temperature, unless we deactivate a zone or two.  And every corner has great air quality.

For the physical installation, Andrew, Chuck, Daniel, Wayne, and Luke took ownership of all my requests, and made them all happen no matter how challenging.  And it was really challenging.  I wanted tons of functions and features, but I didn’t want any of it to be visible…not even any exterior conduit (Thanks Chuck!).  These guys really exceeded my expectations.  As Andrew says, “there are no problems—only solutions.”  And what really impressed me was how upbeat, friendly (and dog-friendly) and efficient everyone was—because this was not an easy job.  We really enjoyed having every one of these guys on the premises, and they regularly attend so much technical training that they are an absolute wealth of information and options.  When our installation was complete, I drove in with a check so that I could personally thank them for a great job, and I was happy to meet Jesse and Amy.  I also got to meet Wes Guthrie.  He said he tells his sons, and the whole staff, to always “just do the right thing”.  Great leadership, and they’re really doing it.  Our HVAC system is amazing.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<text>Zach is a very competent and efficient technician who got our AC working again.   He found the problem, which had previously been diagnosed as something else, and fixed the problem promptly.   It cost us about $200 as opposed to the more than $1000 we had been quoted by someone else.

Guthrie & Son's, came out and repaired my A/C. They were very pleasant and informative and I found the charges to be quite reasonable. I can easily recommend Guthrie and Sons to my family and friends.  Thank you.< /review>

<text>We have used Guthrie and Sons in the past , used them again today and will continue to do so whenever the need arises.  The company is truly family owned and the work ethic is very evident.  Never have we felt pressure to overbuy or over repair and the quality of service has been excellent.  Our HVAC system is older and we could easily be victims of the "gee you should replace this with a new system" but this has never even come up with Guthrie and Sons.  They arrive on time after calling to give a heads up they are on their way, ask what service or problems are to be addressed and proceed to perform their work.  The price quoted was the price it was with no add ons as with some service individuals.  Honesty and integrity are two words I would use to describe this company and I highly recommend them.

From the 1st meeting for an estimate to the service call today Guthrie and Sons staff have been pleasant, professional, reliable and efficient. I believe they are the best choice for heating and air conditioning.< /text>

The service, from start to finish, was professional and efficient. Phil and Kel replaced the ductwork in my home by midday with attention to detail. Both were courteous and attentive to my questions. Our heating system is much improved.< /Review>

Heater and Air Conditioner.....Excellent service from estimate thru installation. Price was very competitive and installation was timely and flawless. Everything was done in a very professional manner, clean up was thorough and the whole experience was very pleasant. Cost was much lower than I thought, no "bells and whistles" pushed in the estimation process although I did elect to have the "Nest" thermostat installed. Highly recommend you give them a call if you need servie or a new A/C or heater.<//review>

< Review>
I had Guthrie & Sons out to give me a second opinion on my HVAC. Another company had given me their opinion but I wasn't happy, it didn't really make sense given the circumstances - I figured it was worth a second opinion. I'm glad I got it. Guthrie & Sons was able to determine what the problem was - nothing more than a bad thermostat. They provided several options and informed me that my 30+ year old system was likely to need replacement soon and it was (is) inefficient. They explained the new laws and requirements for a new system; offered some different thermostat options - fancy to simple; or suggested I could change it myself which is what I ended up doing. The system is up and running for less than $150. When I do replace my system I WILL be calling Guthrie & Sons! Thanks guys, your honesty, cleanliness, professionalism, and thorough way of explaining the situation has earned you huge bonus points and my gratitude.<//Review>

Beginning with the meeting with Joe Patrick last week and ending with the completion of installation of the new heating and air conditioning units today my experience with Guthrie & Sons' staff has been very positive.  Everyone was very courteous, punctual and considerate.  Joe Patrick took time to thoroughly explain the various options and review the process of installing, inspecting and finalizing the new HVAC system.  The installation crew, headed by Nik, took care to minimize the impact of removing the old units and installing the new units.  My wife and I were very comfortable leaving our home for a couple of hours while the installation was being done.  The crew was thorough in cleaning up any debris created by the removal and installation of units.  Nik was very thorough in explaining how to program the thermostat and in reviewing the process for testing and inspecting the installation.  We are very pleased with our new heating and air conditioning system and the work done by all of the staff of Guthrie & Sons with whom we worked.< /text>

The attic space in our 100 year old home is no higher than 12 inches. Nine other HVAC companies refused to install ducting for us. The Guthries made it happen. That was nearly 10 years ago and everything is running great. The Guthries are absolutely the best in San Diego.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Zac fixed me up in just a few minutes.    Great Job...........

Gutherie & Sons does it again:-
1. Phio came out and diagnosed the failure as a gas leak, and got us back into cool on the spot.
2. Today Wayne came out and found the leak point, a manufacturing fault, and got it fixed on site in about 3 hours.
3. Everything covered under warranty!!!

If you want a company you can trust with the very best service (seriously), you won't do better than Gutherie and Sons.
And NO, I am not related............</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I've had equipment installed and things repaired on houses, cars, and other things I've owned, and this has to be about the best experience I've ever had. Taylor, Nick, and Chuck (Norris) came today and installed a large air conditioning system alongside an existing heater for our home. They replaced a broken duct no questions asked, dealt with the problematic power situation at the house in running conduit buried in the ground to keep it from being an unsightly install (and Taylor actually apologized for getting my white rocks dirty!). They quietly came in and sealed our duct registers, explained the whole system thoroughly, thoughtfully considered the potential complaints of condenser noise by my neighbors and installed the condenser lines after moving things around in the garage (and then remembered to move things back in what was a first for me with any contractor!). Taylor swept up after himself (and us) after finding lint and dirt in our registers that spilled out. Nick took plenty of time to discuss with me the details before and after the installation, and Chuck clearly knew what he was doing. If they weren't busy I would have taken them out for a beer. Looking forward to a cool summer --- finally --- at home, and believe the money to have the system from Guthrie is money well-spent.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I'm extremely satisfied with the entire process of working with Family Owned, Guthrie & Sons Heating, Air & Solar. I requested bids for replacing our Central AC & furnace from several companies that I reviewed from my Angie's List account. I requested that bids include 3 AC & Furnace options, plus duct work replacement in attic. When we originally​ bought our Condo, the home inspector informed us that if/when we replace the AC & furnace, we would be limited to the horizontal type due to our attic layout & ceiling access size. Zac, the sales rep, was extremely knowledgeable and did a great job addressing all questions before and during the installation. I was especially impressed that out of the several companies that submitted bids, Zac was the only one that recognized that our existing unit in attic was not to code, AND that we could get a vertical standing unit that have higher Seer Ratings, and therefore are more energy efficient.

Noteworthy: some of the companies providing bids highlighted that their rep was a tech lead & not just a salesperson. They said it's better to have a tech inspect & suggest the unit options since they best understand the requirements based on experience/expertise. So imagine my pleasant surprise when Zac identified options that better suited our request​ and would meet code requirements. He even took pictures and called Guthrie & Son's owner to ensure he was correct before discussing options with me.

We decided on a Rheem Communicating 80% Furnace, 20 Seer - Modulating A/C that included the Rheem Smart Eco-Net Thermostat that can be controlled via Wi-fi & Smart phone.  Plus we got the APCO whole- house air purifier and an Electronic Air Cleaner.  We bought a fairly pricey system, but got it for a great price.

The job took 2 days to complete. The Tech's included Phil, Kel and Josh. They were on time, knowledgeable, courteous, and conscientious about inspecting and ensuring  the delivered units were in perfect condition before and after install. They were also careful that my indoor kitty stayed in the house. They carefuly covered with drop cloths all flooring and all areas that could potentially get soiled, including my entire bedroom closet)/wardrobe as this is the location of the attic access. They also did a good job cleaning up their work, including any debris/dust that initially flowed through the vents. Phil was patient and thorough in answering all of my questions throughout the install and during the final check-off list.

Thank you, everyone, for your great work!<//review>< Date>

Got my Civic Exhaust manifold (already removed from the car) welded in less than 5 mins. The person helped was very attentive and helpful.

Very reason charge for the job and was the same amount the quoted over the phone.

Will be my go-to shop or any future automotive welding jobs</Text>

Wow I would definitely have to say one of the best Express muffler places in town. I brought in a late model Mercedes Benz Sudan, as well as a early model BMW. He did a tremendous job on a BMW. So a year-and-a-half later, I decided to bring a late model Mercedes Benz and have that exhaust updated. And again Great Job! When they say Express they really mean it. 2hr or less! YES.
Now don't let Mercedes-Benz and BMW confuse you most people bringing cars in there aren't bringing in those type of vehicles. To be honest every time I've been there I see Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas, that includes Scion, Volkswagens, Cadillac Escalade, ext. This place has great prices, I haven't found anyone to beat them.< /text>

<review>Cheap if limited in this capabilities. I once took a catalytic converter I bought from Amazon and took it to them to get welded on my car, they did it for $60 without any fuss at all. More recently I went to them to fix a header leak, they decided not to take on the job fearing they would break the studs and end up taking the cylinder head off.</review>< Time>

< Review>
I came in for an wide-band O2 sensor bung weld so I can monitor my 91 Miata turbo air/fuel ratio. Got everything done within 30 mins including plug-in to my air/Fuel gauge. Great service. Will come back when I need any exhausted related work on my other 5 cars. Highly recommended!</Review>

All I wanted was to purchase a couple pieces of tubing about 2 feet long and have a couple bends put in them. Was willing to pay what ever he was going to charge me. He told me I had to bring the car in and they don't sell parts. Went to Babe's Mufflers on The Alameda. They didn't even hesitate,  10 minutes and I was out of there with better than I came in for.< /Review>< Pictures>

I’ve been here twice but never got the good service claimed in some of the reviews. The service was extremely slow. Order was taken wrong. Starters were served after 1h when we had already finished most of the stuff. As I observed, they coordinated very poorly. 3 people were serving the same table beside me while we waited for our service for over 15min<//review>

<Review>Had the nabeyaki udon which was delicious. Also had the spicy tuna roll which came with very fresh tasting wasabi. Great restaurant with friendly staff. Would recommend.

Also they give you a discount if you're staying at The Dylan next door.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
What a GEM!  This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in area!!  The food, service and decor are all top notch!!
I always rate a Japanese restaurant on their Miso soup, if they can't get a simple dish like that right then you know everything else is not up to par.  The Miso was awesome, hot and full of flavor!!  We also order the grilled Ika and hubby had the Chawan Musi , we also had their rolls and a combination dinner and everything tasted amazing !!!
Highly recommended!!  This is our new go to place for Japanese cuisine!!< /Review>

<text>Dr Gentry has been fantastic in helping support me through my pregnancy and delivery of my baby boy. She listened to all my needs and never made me feel pressured to take a certain route for delivery. All the nurses at the clinic were all wonderful and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend East Bay Women's Health.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

<name>Ashley McCullough<//name><date>1617247232755</date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Listened to me as a Black woman. Immediately took my concerns seriously and the ordered an ultrasound right away that revealed a 5 inch 4lb fibroid which she removed and saved my fertility. After 6 years of being ignored by my primal care physician and obgyn who didn’t even do an ultrasound. So much suffering for nothing. My period symptoms were incapacitating. And I lost so much blood once I was hospitalized and got 2 blood transfusions. All because my doctor didn’t believe my pain. So Dr. Gentry. I highly recommend. She’s awesome, fast, so expert.< /Review>< Pics>

I like her. She's passionate and helpful doctor. She kept her word that she's the one operating and delivers my 2nd son. I like their 2 clinics (Oakland and Alameda). After 3 to 4yrs, if I'm pregnant again, I'd still go to her. Thank you doctor for the safe delivery of my son and for taking good care of me.< /review>

Dr. Gentry is very down to Earth and really listens. I had other gynecologists who told me my pelvic pain was normal and that nothing could be done. Dr. Gentry is a wonderful doctor.<//review>

Sin from Dr.Gentry office really helped me this afternoon,called her regarding a issue this morning and she took care of it.
Also Dr.Gentry stepped in to help out ,my daughter and son in law was looking for a good obgyn and I heard really good things about this doctor from another office so I picked this doctor for them. So far so good.
Great Doctor
Thank you Sin for your professionalism.</Text>

<text>Dear Dr. Gentry,
Thank you for doing such a great job with my procedure! I really appreciate how precise and how thorough you were since my very first appointment. It is difficult to find quality work at times and I am so glad I met you. Thanks again and hopefully these fibroid's will stay away.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><username>A Google User< /username></record>

Worst Dr on Earth. During my wife’s delivery she did not show up until last minute was very very rude, and oh the best part she told the very helpful nurses to have my wife hold the baby in until  she arrived to deliver baby which was 30 mins later when the baby was already here. And if it wasn’t for the 2 nurses there we may not have our son today because of the blatant negligence of a “great dr” she sucks.</review>

<user_name>Era Bennell</user_name><Date>1337728465390< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>I have been going to Dr. Gentry's office for more than 15 years.  What I particularly like about Dr. Gentry is her attention to detail.  Her bedside manner makes me feel like I am her only patient.  In her office I do not feel like a file or a number.  She "KNOWS" me.  She knows my condition, my body and somehow remembers little things about me on every visit.  In my mind that is what makes a physician special.  Her skills are unsurpassed!  She is exceptionally  knowledgeable and continues to keep her and her staff in front of all the new treatments, medications and surgeries so that I receive the best medical attention available.  When there are complications I trust her judgment.   She takes the time to explain and clarify what all options are, any  implications there might be and answers every question I may have.  There is no time clock with her and I always feel through her consult  I am confident in the decisions we make regarding the best care for me.  I recommend ALL my friends and associates to her.   I live in San Francisco and go out of my way to continue to see Dr. Gentry.  This is how great of a physician I feel she is.  With a highly specialized condition, Dr. Gentry continues to explore all available options and treatments and initiates a call or appointment to keep me abreast of any changes. I am so grateful for her expertise and thank the staff for their support and caring.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Dr Gentry Saved my Life!!!

Other top Primary Care and OBGYN Drs were not able to complete my diagnosis in a timely manner.

Dr Gentry was able to get her lab staff to expedite completing my imaging and she perform the surgery before "lights out" for me.

I am forever grateful and I highly recommend her practice.<//Text>

I love their traditional Carolina Reeper wings. If you like spice and you can handle them, I highly recommend. Excellent flavor especially when you get the wings wet.<//Text>

<text>Omg I didn’t know it was possible to review restaurants on this! That just blew my mind. BWW is my most favorite spot to get wings. And they always reach the mark. I like wet seasonings. Mango Habanero and Garlic Parmesan are my personal favorites. Yesterday, I tried their Nachos for the first time. It was really good. I added Grilled chicken to it. They were maintaining very good social distancing. Tables were clean and placed far apart. No overcrowding. They provided plenty of alcohol wipes. The waitress was very tentative and had her mask on well. Good COVID wing experience!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Not a good experience, there is not much staff in the restaurant to help and you have to wait almost an hour for your food. Please check your wings before eating them because the wings we received were not cooked fully.<//Review><userid>104295749495233507819<//userid>< Name>

Kelly was an awesome waitress! She was attentive and very kind. The service was pretty quick for a Friday evening and the beers on tap weren’t bad at all I would come here again just for the service< /Text>

It took at least 15 minutes before someone took the receipt and they didn't even acknowledge us. Finally the server came by and cleaned up the table. She was very nice and helpful. I wish I could give a better review, but I just can't considering how long we had to wait for them to clean our table or even talk to us.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20</gmap_id>< UserId.>

Ordered my lunch through the app for a specific time. Came in and it still wasn’t ready. Made me wait 30 mins past my pick up time. It’s ridiculous. If they are short staffed then they need to accommodate. It’s the middle of the lunch rush. Horrible experience. Very unacceptable.<//review>

Ohhh BWW, you are delicious. I got them to go and ordered them online but they prepared them perfectly. It was a busy night but worth the wait. Will definitely order from here again.< /Review>

<Review>I was waiting for 30 minutes more than what time suppose to be. I know the workers work hard and very friendly. But the owners need better more workers or a better way to serve. I used to buy food to go but this Sunday I had a but experienced.< /Review>< name>

The wings of this place were flavorless. They put less sauce and the wings tasted like boiled chicken. Only one person helped to order when they're crowded. At least she was nice.<//review>

BWW is dependable - you know what you're going to get, whichever location you visit. One plus in the pandemic: buffalo wings hold up to takeout better than many/most fast casual options. Would be nice if they had more side options that weren't fried, because that stuff doesn't do well after it site for a few minutes on the way home.<//review>

The most disgusting wings I have ever had in my life. I am NOT exaggerating when I say my nephew and I ate two or three day old, STALE wings. It was disgusting. Don't get me started on the fries. They were hard and were definitely reheated in a microwave. You could taste that stale, old, cheap taste. Ill never be back to this location.< /Review>

I haven't been to a BWW in many years but stopped in to watch a basketball game and have beers and snacks.  What a disappointment with the food being very mediocre, much smaller BWW than I'm used to and no sound on the TVs.  There are much better places to watch games, eat and drink.< /Review>

I ordered through the app and watched my order go from prep to cooking and finally to ready for pickup. When I go pick up my food at the bww the cashier tells me my food is not ready yet..... what purpose does the app serve if I had to wait for them to cook my food when I got there ?</Text>

If you look at my reviews I almost always give 5 stars or just don't rate.  As a business owner I don't want to cast shade, but after several attempts and really wanting to like this place, since its so close, it's a total fail. Horrible service, poor management, and often the food would come out very bad.  Overall I like BWW, but stay far away from this location.< /review>

<Name>Simon Kaulius< /Name><text>Great ambience with lots of flat screen TVs everywhere and lots of outdoor seating too! Happy Hour until 7pm. Good food and good service. Just note that two thirds of the indoors is designated as bar seating with high top tables, yet only the bar counter itself is first come first serve seating. The high top tables require you to put your name down and wait. The chicken tacos are great. The fried mushrooms are great. The fried pickles are not that great because they're thick sliced and the breading is falling off. The Bourbon Honey Mustard is my favorite wing sauce.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

<review>Amending my review: I strongly recommend sitting at the bar if at all possible. The service is much faster and the quality is just as good!

The quality of the wings is pretty good (and what you'd expect from a wing joint) but the service is just so damned slow as to not be worth it. Also, we had an empty soda glass waiting at the edge of the table for a refill, and at least different people (including our waitress!) walked past it without picking it up. Our stay was an hour and a half, but we could have easily shaved 30 minutes off if they'd been more prompt.</review>< name>

Hopefully this helps you decide whether to visit this location or go to one a mile further. Wings were only half seasoned and celery sticks were close to molding. Learn from my mistake and go to different one.

UPDATE: Was contacted by a manager after posting this. There way to solve this problem was to give me a voucher for a free SNACK size of wings after spending 35 dollars for a order that was thrown together. Didn't accept the voucher not worth wasting the time to go back.</text>

<Review>I placed an order online, when I got home I was missing 10 wings. I called to get a refund and was on hold for 15min, I hung up and called back again. Was put on hold for another 10 min, hung up and called but again for the 3rd time apparently I’m waiting for a manager as they are busy with people sitting inside eating, outside and take out. I though you were only allowed take out and out door seating at this time. Not this place!!!<//Review>< pictures>

It's not possible to give this place zero stars. If we had not talked to the manager I don't believe we would have received our order. We ordered our drinks and appetizers but no one came back to take our order. When the waitress finally came back she didn't wait for a response when she had already passed by and was taking the order from the next table. When she finally passed by again she brushed me off and said she be right back. When she came back she had an attitude didn't write our order down. We waited over 30 minutes to finally see food. This was after an hour of being sat down and talking to the manager. Love the food but not worth the service.  Not coming back to this place.

Thank you very much to a helpful manager.< /text>

<Review>It wasn't too busy last night when we arrived but tables were left dirty our entire time there.  There were crumbled chips and trash all over the floor.  Server after server came by the tables were patrons were no longer sitting but no one took anything away.  Had it been busy I would understand but it wasn't.  Definitely didn't leave any desire to return to this location again. Made me wonder if the customer area was this filthy, what the kitchen looked like.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>I ordered 10 pieces of wings + fries through official website at 6:40 PM. The estimated time for pickup was 7:00 PM. On this time I already was on place and waited for 20 more minutes. First in application the pickup time changed to 7:10, then to 7:15. So I waited totally for 10 pieces of wings 40 minutes. When in 5 minutes I opened the box with food, it was almost cold, the food in a box looked like a mess, since there were no sections in the box.
Please fix you application so the estimated time would not delay constantly, but showing the average amount of waiting time, because right now there is an impression that Buffalowildwings doesn't care about people time.

<review>The worst food, service I had at this place ever,

female restroom no toilet paper, no paper towels to dry hands, males restroom where durty too,

we got sit on a dirty table, they stared spraying the table to clean it when we were sit, chicken so dry, fries no well cook we wait, never refil for drinks,

Just to paid we had to wait 10 minutes to get someone to charged us,

I asked for manager, at the end manager try to make it better, but where it was the manager all this time, the team works how the management let them be,

but after all the bad experience,  gift cards dosen't change tha bad experience.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Mar Gtz<//user_name>< Time>

<Text>I live around the corner and every time I come here they mess up my order. And since it's a To-go order there's no way of complaining and getting it fixed right away. Yesterday I ordered using the app, for a pickup at 430pm. I ordered around 3pm. I get to the restaurant @430pm and am told that it's being bagged in the back and will be right out. At 453pm,....over 20 mins of waiting inside with an uncomfortable mask on,  my order is finally ready. WHY ORDER AHEAD OF TIME IF I'M STILL GOING TO MADE TO WAIT FOR OVER 20 MINS?? It defeats the entire purpose of ordering ahead so you don't havey to wait 😡 Then I get home and the order is wrong,..... As usual. Needless to say I will NEVER be back to this location. It's ridiculous that EVERY time I come here something is wrong.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The wings here are really good and so is the customer service. We were seated quickly. Had fun watching the game on the television. Why are their carrots so good here?? They have a good variety of sauces so you're never bored with flavors here. I enjoyed my whole experience here. Parking is easy too, they have a large lot. We came here on a friday night and there were hardly any people. Overall, great experience.<//Review>

<Text>First, our waiter could care less if we were customers. We had to practically wave him over like a airline ground guide. After a long wait...well the waiter throw our food down as it was slop. As we were eating mid-way the waiter brought over left over boxes and bags took our plates as if it is time to go. This is the second time at this location where paying customers are not treated with the respect. I urge caution to visit this location...God speed if you do.</Text><Response>None<//Response><username>Jr Gose< /username>< Rate>

Placed take out order and paid online for Super Bowl Sunday. It's organize chaos assembling and handing out the take out orders to patrons. Every year they have a different procedure and I been going there the last 5 years for SB Sunday take out. This will by my last time. Past years my orders were late by 20 minutes or (and) missing an item. This year my order was short of all veggies. Maybe they should include this on the check list. I'll be ordering from another establish fornnext SB Sunday.< /text>

<review>Super sketchy. Came here. Placed an order in the takeout. Was asked to take a seat at any table in the waiting area. Watched while 3-4 people came and gone from one or another table with no masks and the establishment isn’t wiping down the tables when people leave who are sitting on inside... it’s just one person sits then another sits ...  Super unclean. Didn’t even get my order. Asked for a refund and walked out. Disgusting.< /review>< name>

Ordered 10 pieces of boneless and 6 traditional. Only 5 came in my traditional box even though it had a sticker with the number 6 on it. Disappointed and feeling ripped off!</review>

2) Asked for ranch with carrots - forgets ranch

3) Asked for sauce on the side - sauce on the wings

Food was nice but not worth the price or the 20 min wait for the takeout. Ate at this place 3 times, first time, dined in, was a great experience. The second time we went in, we were ignored and staff were rudely dismissive, so we walked out. Tonight we decided its been long enough that we should try again. The girl at take out counter couldn't even smile at us and spoke the bare minimum to achieve the order. When we went back to collect, we thought she smiled for a second, but no, we were met with the same uninterested, 'here take it and get out' vibe.< /review>

<review>Said they were open until 8pm. At 7:15pm I tried to order but said pick up would be for the next day. So I called, no answer. Called again, no answer. I call again and let it ring about 20 times. No answer. I don't think they are open until 8pm.<//review>< GmapID>

Food was good as usual,  but service was very slow. In fairness it was Sunday afternoon football, but lunch took over 2 hours and we waited 30 minutes for the check after  flagging down the server.  They were clearly understaffed.</review>

<Review>It was a Thursday evening and I had spent my whole evening playing basketball. My teammates and I were exhausted and we shared a common interest in going to buffalo wild wings. We ubered to the nearest one and saw there would be a wait. We asked and they said it would be a mere 20 minutes. We decided to wait and went outside, however after 20 minutes we were not even close to being shown to a table.

The longer we waited I could feel the hunger gnawing away at me. My strength was fading and standing was starting to become impossible. I managed to lift my head  and looked despairingly at my teammates. The bleak look in their eyes told me that we couldn't do this much longer. Our bodies desperately needed calories...

I wouldn't wish this on the worst of my enemies. The strife buffalo wild wings put us through this night was inexcusable...<//Review>< pics>

I made it before last call for drinks but it took the server longer just to let me know they didn't have the adios I wanted or the Irish drink she recommended. And when I finally settled for a beer she said I couldn't order anymore, even though it was the place's fault for not having the drinks I wanted . Very disappointed. We even gave her a fat tip . Won't be coming here again.</review>

<Review>My sandwich came about 30 minutes later than the rest of my party's food.  15 minutes after the rest of the party's food came, the waitress came to tell me they were out of the specific cheese used on the sandwich, and asked if they could substitute it for something else. The hell do I care what cheese is on the sandwich, I just want to eat and get out! And why wasn't my sandwich ready, with the substituted cheese at the same time as the rest of the food? Had a great time watching my friends eat, then eating my medicore sandwich at my desk. Didn't ruin bww for me, but won't be returning to this one.<//Review>< Resp>

<text>I was not successful in trying to place a take-out order on my smartphone, had to order in person instead.  The food is pretty good, but it is not cheap.  If you want inexpensive fast food, there are places in the neighborhood that are better for that.  If you like sitting at a sports bar with many screens with different games showing, and you don't mind a noisy environment, this might be the place for you.  A place for a quiet, relaxing dinner out it is not.< /text>< pictures>

Horrible service , took forever to bring the food and our food was cold . We order fries and they were cold  and hard , like if they were old fries. Didn't had any of the salad dressing we wanted. They gave us plastic forks because they run out of silverware.   The place was very dirty , when you walk you could feel the carpet was very sticky. Never coming to this place again.<//text>

Unfortunately my friend and i came in and our food was significantly delayed, I spoke to Jeff, whom was the manager on duty, and he sincerely apologized, and expedited our order, we had Bill take over on our table, and he responded with immaculate service, was very involved at our table and made sure we were taken care of, food was delicious as always

5-23-17
Wack service, went in at 330 had a beer ordered 10 wings and left after almost 20 minutes of no food, is my review biased based on the fact that I am really hungry, probably. Still the staff was acting laid back, I assume a shift change, avoid the early stages of happy hour. I usually on order to go through the app, since I work in the area.</Review>

<review>I work 8 hours. I only get one hour of a lunch. I did the right thing, to call for takeout order. The staff confirmed my order and said it will be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. So I waited at work until it passed the 15 minutes. When I was at the takeout to pick up my order, they said it should be ready in a few. Next to me was a lady that recently ordered on site. 25 minutes later she received her order and I did not. Finally, I went to ask a staff about my order. It took another 15 minutes. Once I got my order, there was no time for me to eat. I skipped my LUNCH. I was crying of anger because someone should've told me something and I definitely didn't want to make a scene. Bad experience.

I'm even a blazin rewards member, I go to other locations without this problem.< /review><Rate>1<//Rate><userid>116966594249656936583< /userid><response>{'time': 1565627406841, 'text': 'Hey Ashley.

The little salad on the side were so tiny and we're basically lettuce and carrots. Last time we were there we waited over 45 minutes for one order of bone-in wings and one order of chicken tenders.</Review>< pics>

Got the table quickly, waited 30 minutes to order, 35 minutes to get food, consumed close to room temp wings, thirsty since we got no refills, no one came to check, another 35 minutes to get the cheque. Had to leave my table and interrupt the manager who was too busy giggling with the front of house staff to get me settled so i can leave. Meanwhile all the tables were empty and people were piling up at the entrance. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE. DONATE HALF OF IT TO CHARITY AND SPEND THE REST @ IN AN OUT.< /Text>

My second time eating at Buffalo wild wings.
1st. Time was dine in. Pretty laid back, sports atmosphere.
2nd. Time was take out. Online order.
Total food quality? Pretty ok, nothing special.< /text>

Restroom was absolutely disgusting, water covered almost every surface in it, I felt like I needed a shower and a disenfectant for my shoes after going in to wash my hands. Hopefully the restroom situation can be fixed, but something else needs to be done about the service and atmosphere.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I love BWW. The service here is a lot better. The last few visits have been good. The new management staff is definitely doing a better job. I always sit at the bar. The bartenders here are all very cute and helpful. They take care if you which is a nice change. $5 pitchers of bud light on football games doesn't hurt either.< /Text><Date>1548649415176< /Date></record>

<Review>We came to bww on a saturday evening. Were seated in the patio section. Ordered our food right away. Food was brought out timely. After our food was brought out, we didnt see much from server. We had to keep trying to get her a attention. We were left with no napkins and no towelettes.Lets just say our basket of fries was not really a basket of fries. It had less than half. Seemed as if someone had ate half of the fries before they were served. Our ranch cups were filled with less than half of ranch. We had to ask for additional ranch. Food was good but needs better service.<//Review>< gmapID>

For the last 2 years every Thursday my wife and I go to Buffalo Wild Wings. We have our go to spots but also try new locations. This particular location is literally 2 blocks from our house, but we try to avoid it when we can. They are over staffed however still manage terrible and slow service. The food is always dry even after we say extra wet, and never consistent. Multiple times our mozzarella sticks have come out cold, the cheese inside is literally a block.

Twice we've been sat in dirty tables, I assumed after the waiter took our drink order they would come back to clean it. Thank corporate for providing those wet wipes, which I used to clean the table.

If you do come to this locations ask to sit in Bills section, best server there.

I'll take a trip here just to take pictures of the food, I'll edit my post with the images soon.<//Text>

<text>Waited 2 hours for a table. We were a big group, and they told us it would be an hour wait. No problem. However, around the 1.5 hour mark, a big group left & the table was left with the cups/food for a good 20 minutes without anyone cleaning it. The hostess at the front didn't seem like the wanted to be there & were no help. We even overheard one saying that she wasn't going to clean up that table. We had to speak with the manager in order for them to start cleaning. 2 of our group members left before we even got seated. We knew the wait would be long, but we were frustrated since the table was empty but no one wanted to clean it.< /text>< pictures>

<review>If I can give it zero stars I would! Worst customer service ever! Dess was serving me and my buddies at first. She was great and assisted us with drinks pretty fast. I’m assuming her shift was over or something and some guy named Ryan Le becomes our server. This guy was THE WORST. He spent most of his time picking up other people’s cups and trash than to bring us our food. Kid you not, 30 minutes later he brings us our food and sure thing the fries and wings were barely even warm. We all finished and took us another 30 minutes to even give us our check and another 15 to give us our cards back. To conclude this horrible service he charged me extra for who knows what but at that point I didn’t care how much it was I just wanted to leave.<//review>< Resp>

Overpriced , small wings with very little meat on the bone, waited too long for a to  go order. Spinach dip was very good .You can get much better tasting wings way cheaper  down the street at  The Halal Guys on Bristol . They also have a place called Dough & Arrow a few doors away where I purchased the most unbelievable cookies ever! Try the creme brulee one it's spectacular.</Review>

Waited 2 hours for a table. We were a big group, and they told us it would be an hour wait. No problem. However, around the 1.5 hour mark, a big group left & the table was left with the cups/food for a good 20 minutes without anyone cleaning it. The hostess at the front didn't seem like the wanted to be there & were no help. We even overheard one saying that she wasn't going to clean up that table. We had to speak with the manager in order for them to start cleaning. 2 of our group members left before we even got seated. We knew the wait would be long, but we were frustrated since the table was empty but no one wanted to clean it.<//text>

<text>It's Bdubs. Even though we got there at a hot time, 6pm, we were able to do the "self seating" and get in and out with our food in our bellies by a little before 7! The service was fast, and the food was good. Bdubs doesn't have the best wings I've ever had, but they're pretty good comparatively to other places. There was plenty of parking, and the service was quick.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20< /Gmap_id><Rate>4< /Rate>< Time>

Our wings were warm when they arrived and our server basically gave us no service. She didn't check on us once and we kept having to stop her in the middle of helping other tables because she never checked on us.< /Review>

<Review>Bdubs is my favorite wing spot! Lots of gripes at this location because it is a lot smaller than most bdubs and the host are not very efficient with sitting guests.  This bdubs still gets 4 stars because of the service of Dawn, our waitress. After having to go through the long wait to be seated, being seated on a table that was not fully clean, and now being hangry, Dawn quickly turned the evening in to a positive experience. We placed the dirty tray that had been left behind at the corner of the table so the next employee that passed could take it away. 4 waitresses passed before and ignored the tray until Dawn walked by and said "where did this come from??? I'm so sorry it was left here" and she took it away. The rest of the evening was full of her attentive service that turned what could have been a negative experience at bdubs in to a very positive experience. Thanks again Dawn!< /Review><Time>1571978913710< /Time><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

Worse experience of my family life. Management is horrible. Accused one of my family members of stealing someone else's money in the bathroom, let the other person and 2 managers approaches in an aggressive way when we had six kids with us and my sister in law is 5 months pregnant. The cops were called on us and even the cops thought it was a joke. We didn't even get to eat our food. Bad enough the person that approaches in an aggressive way was a teenager and we are all over 30 years old. The cops even told the manager to calm down because he was screaming at me. After the cops were laughing and left one manager came up to us and apologized. The other manager left and didn't apologize at all. I will never recommend this place to anybody or go there again.< /text>

My Own Personal Option --

I do NOT NOT like This restaurant at
all !!

I will NOT Come back again !!

#1
The FOOD Quality is Very POOR.
Super DRY, Tiny size and Stiff
Chicken Wings...

Supermarket' s Frozen Chicken Wings
has MUCH BETTER quality than
This Restaurant.

The Cost and Performance Ratio
is LOW....

EXPENSIVE Food and Beverage,
with Small Tiny portion of the
Food...

#2
Staffs were Friendly,  sexy, but
Took a while to get the service.</review>

<review>It was okay. I sat at the bar but you can tell the bartender just wanted the night to end. Sucks, I had to be generous and smile a lot for her to provide good service.

Alex lacks customer service skills. No eye contact at all. I was there picking up an order and I got there a few minutes before my pick up time. When I got in the store no one was at the counter to help for at least 5 minutes. Another gentleman was waiting to be helped before I arrived. And another gentleman arrived after me. We all waited another few minute until finally a Alex came out to help us. He took down all our names. We all waited 10 mins after that and finally food came out which none of them were mine. So I asked again on my order status to Alex. His response was “we are very busy” with no eye contact. There was no, “sorry for the wait” or “let me check on your order” nothing! It was 20mins past my pick up time and everyone (at least 5 other people) that was there already left with their food. I finally got my food. Never again. I’ll cancel my order next time I have to wait more then 10 mins. Thanks Alex for your awesome customer service.< /Text>

<review>Not a good place for a large (15) group of people. Not enough servers for the amount of customers, therefore long wait times for everything. I attempted to call ahead for reservations but they Do Not take any. If you like food that spicy, even the other items that are not wings or chicken, then this is a place to go.</review>< username>

Probably the worst Buffalo Wild Wings I been too. Got seated, waited 45 minutes and no one ever took our order or got us drinks just kept walking by like they didn’t see us. Ended up going to another BWW<//Review>

<Text>Worst customer service experience I've had in quite a while. I arrived just as the food was supposed to come out. The food was THIRTY minutes late. In that time, I wasn't offered any drink or even a seat or any updates about my food!! when the food finally came out, two of the sides of sauces I had ordered weren't there. Instead of trusting me (why would I lie about a $1.20 value?), staff had to go back into the kitchen and check my order. Then, they sent me off, unapologetic. I've worked in the food industry, even when the customer is wrong and complains we give them a free drink voucher or a gift card. In this case -- a thirty minute extraneous wait and an incorrect order -- I think that at least an apology was in order. Never coming back here -- the BWW in Irvine at least knows how to treat its customers</Text><GmapID>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20<//GmapID><resp>None<//resp></record>

< review>
As a big fan of BWW, I was sadly disappointed by the quality of both the food and service at this location. I came to this location with a group of 11. I understand that large groups may be difficult, but for a Tuesday night and an almost empty restaurant, 55 minutes between arrival and food is ridiculous. Additionally, the food came out in 4 different waves. By the time the last person got their food, everyone else was finished. Also, the restrooms we're disgusting and reflect poorly on BWW as a whole. My rewards points did not work and I paid for a meal that should have been completely covered by my points. All in all, if you are looking to grab lunch or dinner in the area, you're better off at McDonalds across the street .</review>

<Review>I love wings and so far these are my favorite I go every week once but honestly I  have ran into so many upsetting situations with  this place. I've been debating whether to write a review or not but after yesterday I decided too. There are TWO carry out parking spots that were taken from someone that was dinning in because when I got there, their was ONE lady in the carry out Registry   getting her order after she left the other car was still there which at the time I was the only one picking up my order to leave. So I had to park all the way where CVS is at to just CARRYOUT my order. I mention it to the MANAGER which didn't care. That is horrible  customer service  and disrespectful from whoever takes those parking's! then after that I get there all the girls in the front desk for carryout have no customer service greeting they have a face like if they just didn't want to be there, 2nd my order was wrong and I had to wait after it was brought to me they forgot my sauce and you tell them and they give you this attitude when you clearly placed your order through the phone which they have it WRITTEN and still didn't get right. LOL Lastly, I could have easily just left and not paid because they didn't even know I didn't pay till I had to tell them I haven't paid. I know there might be many KARLAS  but there is one specific KARLA that I dont know her last name but this Karla she is a petite,  black hair girl, makeup always on point she is a server now SHE HAS BEEN THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICES PERSON I adore her and always had my order right. Keep in mind this was just yesterday plus all the other times that I've had issues with but if i mention them ALL I will never finish.</Review><userid>114620315898130387387<//userid>< date>

<Text>I called this place because I love their wings, Alisa I believe was her name answered and placed me on hold for a minute or so she said, I was on hold for 9 minutes and she never came back. I hung up and called again, same person answered and after I told her I had been waiting for 9 minutes she she said “ oh I am so sorry about that let me put you on a brief hold and I will be right back to help you”  and she went on to put me on hold AGAIN. Very annoyed right now,  even do I love their food. If they don’t have enough people on busy nights to answer the phones they should really hire some more.< /Text>< date>

<text>We ordered a plain cheeseburger.  PLAIN only patty, cheese and buns. Theu bring a burger with lettuce and dressing on it. We send it back and we get the same burger bacl with the dressing scrapped off and still pieces of lettuce on the bun and mayo still on the edges of the bun. Then we decide we are going to order something else. It took forever to get our replacement plate. The manager didnt cpme and apologize once. The waitress was great by the way and we left her a good tip but this is a perfect example of how your cooks play a big pary on customer service. The reason why this was important was because my girlfriend is allergic to mayonnaise so if she would of ate that it would of ruined our whole night. We wont be coming to this one anymore cooks like that.< /text>< pics>

<text>Well I visited this place a few weeks ago. And I forgot my waiters name. I don't know maybe a "Ryan". No idea, however he was outstanding. Let's make this funny he was Caucasian about 5.9, very short hair. Probably near 40 years old. I can't wait to see you again. You treated me like a queen. @thequeenofvenice 😉</text>< Pictures>

Deserves a top rating for the excellent service.  Kaylynn was the best hostess I've encountered at any such place in a long time.
We've all had wings, and there was nothing different about the food than any of the better locations in this franchise.
But the service was exceptional, and when you're serving up menu items I can buy practically anyplace in town, exceptional service provided by Kaylynn is really the only thing that puts you above the competition.
Well this joint has it!< /Text>

<review>I went with coworkers after work (12AM) and the server forgot to bring my drink 3 times and it took about 40 minutes to get our wings and when we did get our food it was SUPER dry. like they've been out for a while. They ended up giving us a discount cause none of us (4 in total) ate our wings because of how disgusting it was. It was my 1st time at this location and never again.<//review>< UserId.>

Try the bourbon honey mustard wings. I think they're a temporary item, but they are good enough to be permanent!
Wish the bar had more seating; this place is always busy.< /Text>

<Review>REVIEW FOR THIS LOCATION ONLY:

STAFF AND SERVICE: 1/5
Service is pretty slow, wait staff will almost always conveniently forget to add points to your account after you leave, and they often take more than one attempt to get your order correct for takeaways.

Ricardo, the manager, forgot twice to follow through on his promise to send gift card for takeaway orders they messed up. Convenient again, right?

AMBIENCE AND LOCATION: 3/5
Situated in the heart of Orange County’s premier shopping area, South Coast Plaza, this location is pretty big with plenty of seating capacity and options. Sports and channel selection is always on spot. Parking can be an issue on weekends and Tue/Thurs nights.

FOOD: 3/5
The wings are amazing, although they are usually out of few sauces on the list, especially the new and limited-time ones. Boneless wings can sometimes be smaller than McDonald’s nuggets (LOL) for an entire order - so watch out for those, complain to you waiter, and avoid being ripped off.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20< /Gmap_id></record>

Some staff are great while others have a very bad attitude. You sometimes even have to remind them on how to so their job. Ex: get us boats,straws,  Utensils, etc..< /text>< Resp>

The Filipino fellow with the bandana was giving us terrible attitude he obviously did not want to give us the free snack even though it was my birthday and I had the blazin rewards app :(. My friend has ordered a medium, he said the medium came with 18 pieces and my friend only got 12. The waiter was terrible he shouldn't be working with customers at all. He rushed me by picking up the trash before I had finished. I have seen this fellow at the gym and he had been wearing the exact same headband that he wore to work. I am low-key pissed I am not coming back the customer service sucks!< /text>

I'm normally a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, but the food here was a bit on the meh side. First, we weren't given carrots and celery for our entire meal. I mean the food was decent, but it didn't meet the expectations I have for BWW. The mozzarella cheese sticks were a bit stale and the ranch tasted a little old. The wings didn't have the amount of flavor that I like in my wings. The interior is like every other Buffalo Wild Wings, but it was a bit smaller. Overall, I'm a little disappointed of this place....<//Text>

<Text>For the price the food is not as good as other locations. They are skimpy with the sauce on dried out wings. I've tried this place three times and sad to say only one of them had fresh juicy wings but with same light coating of sauce. Also, the wait.....im not sure if it is on purpose but there was not one time the server even acknowledged the table in a timely manner. Even when there is less then 5 tables it still took a long time to actually get a basket of wings. But when it's busy, the crowd is loud.  Not in a good way but in an obnoxious 30-40 something teenager way. It's sad cause i love other BWW but the one right next door is just not worth it.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2edf261ff1:0xb9945945c70b4c20</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great service, tasty food, clean atmosphere. I have visited other BWW in Orange County but prefer this one as I believe it is much cleaner and more organized.<//Text>

<Text>Came here for an engagement party, there were 8 of us. One of us had water dripping on them the entire time from the AC, and another had the sun in their face from the side door. When we complained about the AC we were told "oh yeah it happens all the time"

That makes it worse.

Also I don't recommend the whiskey sours.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Food was good but service is slow. Took a long time for our drinks, a long time for our entrees, the appetizers we ordered came out after our food (and we had to ask where apps were). Took about 20 mins to try and catch the eye of a server to get our check. Iced tea was hella watered down.< /Text>< Date>

< Review>
I try to order by phone, but they said only walking orders available. So I went to the store and I ordered boneless Wild chicken. At that time some body call and ordered chicken over the phone. lol Finally, they gave me just fried chicken with little seasoning. lol
Good bye Buffalo.< /Review>

<rate>1</rate><text>One of the worst restaurant experiences ever! I was excited to come to this BWW because of it's location but will not come back. Last night, I came in with a group of 9 to enjoy some wings and football Sunday. Friends arrived and grabbed the bar seating, but wait; apparently this location doesn't understand what bar seating means. Bar seating is NOT bar seating! WTF!! The manager Gabe, told our group the tables we found is bar seating, but we had to wait and put our name down on the list. So back in line we went. Management needs to be trained. After waiting, we were finally seated in the patio area.

Food took way....too long! I understand it's busy but come on, do we really need to wait a hour for the food? Our server Mario was nice us enough to take separate checks for each person but "pretended" to write each order on his notepad. Forget about receive the checks in a timely manner and correct. After 1 hour of waiting the checks arrived but of course it was wrong. I gave him a pass because everyone makes mistakes. But come on really, you get my check wrong another 3 times? Took over a hour just for our group to pay.

Basically, STAY AWAY from this location. It's not worth your time. Staff is poor because the management is HORRID! Will not be coming back to this location unless it's under new management.<//text>< pics>

I came in and was ignored completely by Lesley!!! Please put someone nicer and friendlier in the front. Instead of taking my name she took the girls name in back of me. I brought it to her attention and told her I was infront of the girl. She didnt care nor did she apologize and didn't bother correcting her error on the list. I'm a frequent customer here and this is the first time I'm treated this way! A simple I'm sorry would have made a huge difference!!!!< /text>

Order about $50 worth of food through grubhub to have delivered to my hotel. They sent my wife's salad with NO dressing, they didn't send my dips for my wings either. You would think when people pay that much money, they would double check the order before it leaves. Super irritated. DISAPPOINTED!!!</review>

Its hit or miss with the servers. Food is always good, but sometimes they mess up your order. They always correct it with an additional small wait time, but take responsibility. The drinks are on the strong side, but thats better than them making it light. The parking is not that great even with how big the lot is, but there is additional parking with a slight walk</review>

They are always super busy, but the servers are great. Food was good. We went in on Friday around 9pm with a big group of 15 people,  took about 45minutes, but the managers were both there an on top of things.<//Review>

The food is good, but even when they are not too busy the service is very slow. We sat for about 15 min before anyone came to our table to great us or take drink orders.</Review>

< Review>
i came to this restaurant  during opening week and it was horrible.  1st, there were waiters who randomly went to tables asking if we ordered appetizers, if we ordered more utenzils, they took us another tables drinks, the waiters were very unorganized and did not know what food n drinks went to which table.

we were seated outside and asked them to roll the curtains down because the sun was hittting us in the face...apparently the curtains dont roll down.

when it came to paying...it took our server 20 mins to bring the check.  i walked up to the front and payed there.  i asked to talk to a manager and they couldnt find one...really?

i will gladly now drive past this one to go to another buffalo wild wings.</Review>

<Text>Rolled in last week to check it out. Sat at he bar, ordered a beer (or 3) watched a little football, paid my tab and was out Rolled into the bar tonight (Monday, Jan 5 super slow, holiday BS over) sat at a bar table and after being passed up by 4 or 5 servers was finally greeted by a gal who asked, if this is where I was gonna sit - in other words, how dare you sit a table meant for 4 persons Mr Single guy! Oh shizznat there goes my check average! Yes miss not so interesting server girl, this is where I'm gonna sit can you, please bring me a Dos Equis....What I'm sorry, did you say you need to see my ID? Oh wow, why thank you, thank you for the compliment or should I say insult...I'm 54 years young why in the hell are you asking for my ID? Policy, policy my a**....where's the manager! Along comes mini Mex, all 5 foot nothing and who irreverently addresses me with a greeting of "hey boss what's up? I got your boss right here! After mini Mex tried unsuccessfully to explain their "We ID everyone policy" I unapologetically dropped a couple "F" bombs and opted out of this below average establishment. BWW spent alotta money building this place however after my shameful and embarrassing experience they should restrategize their ID policies and train their managers and servers to interact with guests on a more sophisticated, intelligent level< /Text>< resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Although the flavor of the different menus is tasty, the service is somewhat slow, there is free parking for customers. The attention of the waiters in some cases is not very good.

<review>(Translated by Google) They even leave you waiting for a table and they tell you 20 min. I would feel more comfortable if they told me that it would take 1 hour for them to lie to me by telling me 20 and it happened to me 2 times in the Real Madrid vs Liverpool game and in the Mexico vs Wales game they were not broadcasting the game

(Original)
Te dejan hasta una esperando mesa y te dicen 20 min. Me sentiria mas cómodo q me digan que tardaran 1 hora a que me mientan diciendome 20 y me ocurrió 2 veces en el partido real Madrid vs Liverpool y en el de México vs gales no estaban transmitiendo el partido</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>
