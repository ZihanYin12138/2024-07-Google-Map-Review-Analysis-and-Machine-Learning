Great selection. Not super busy so it's a nice place to relax and hold a conversation with someone. The beehive style in structure is captivating and very friendly.</text>

Love this place! Refreshing, icy beverages with natural ingredients, vegan eats, smoothies, beautiful interior and amazing snacks! I wish they had more locations. Hoping to go back soon.< /text>

< review>
So me and my boyfriend spent 70$ here only to get food that's on the same level as toco bell . We ordered our food though door dash ($50- bee and tea) (20-door dash). When we got our food it was not even close to being worth 50! My bf ordered a spicy chicken wrap that's had a ton on sticky sweet stuff and was far from spicy on top of tea that was over brewed and so strong we couldn't even drink it it was disgusting! We also got like these vital power bowls which they had run out of fresh fruit and didn't even give us a discount . When I called to speak with the manager, she was just as clueless as the regular employees on how to go about refunding us. She took my number and told me the owner would get back to me and it's been a week ! The only business that refunded me was door dash! I will not be returning to this inefficiency and unprofessional establishment ever<//review>

<Review>Prices are expected. Quality was much better before they remodeled and changed the menu. The cups are thin, if your drink takes any fall it will likely split on the side. The variety of popping boba is fun. If you like boba pearls but hate the slimy stuff on them, this is a good choice. Sample as much as you can before you commit to a drink, it's not easy nor hard to order something you'll hate. I'm not wild about this place, but it does fill that occasional craving.

I've never tried the forever yogurt because it looks sketch.</Review>< time>

Being 30 minutes away on the other side of the city does not stop us from going every week. Everything I've tried have been AMAZING. Hope they open one up closer to us soon!<//text>

<text>The owner is racist!!! Wouldn't take our bill wanted us to pay with card. Then other customers came in after us and were greeted and treated very differently than us. Even offered other customers ingredients that were not displayed. Disappointed about that type of service in 2018. But hopefully you will be of the majority that gets excrllent customer service. Visited the one on Monterey Rd.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<review>When we walked in the music was so loud we couldn't talk to our selves ( my wife and kid). So we didn't hear anyone greet us as we were the only customers. So no help no welcome no sample tastes. We asked them to turn down the music and they did. I'm not that old the music was very loud. They have a lot of yogurt choices and toppings. They have more toppings at the counter that we didn't notice until leaving the yogurt machine area were they have alot of toppings. They have alot of drinks which I couldn't figure out what they are.. they also have some hot foods like pork buns. It's a strange combination. So we ate our yogurt and left (no thanks for coming!) To our new place.. I don't need to return here. Oh the location is tricky to get in and out of. When leaving you can only turn right so I cut through the parking lot by the Habit ( next-door) to get to the light to go back the other way. Just a pain in the butt. I'll go back to Tutti Fruity thanks.< /review>< Date>

The boba is made with honey and it was to die for! Definitely one of my favorite spots for boba when im in the area! Also where else can you get a ginger shot along with boba tea?< /Text>

<review>Workers were definitely awkward and rude. As I was paying, I noticed that the cashier took her time to smirk at another employee. Also, I ordered my drink extra sweet and ended up being super bitter. I was really looking forward to making this my usual boba spot but, I'll just take my money elsewhere.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

IT WAS TERRIBLE! I ordered an acai bowl, and it took them 20 minutes! The waitress thought that it was for one of the workers and put it in the fridge.  Then she took it out and gave it to me without an apology. I look at it and it looks like BARF. it was not blended all the way and there was a sad piece of banana and a strawberry. It was watery and had a rotten taste to it and it was 10 dollars! I ordered boba and they were out of boba as well! Never going again.<//text>

<Text>As of April 2018, this place is reopen. Bee&Tea is still around, however, Forever Yogurt (the froyo) has been replaced with Juice Zone (I guess Forever Yogurt wasn't actually forever -_-). Juice Zone offers smoothies, fresh juices, and similar items. That portion of the restaurant opens at 8AM. The Bee&Tea portion, which seems to serve the same boba teas and food ( like the 1 pound "Asian" wrap), opens at 10AM. They both close at 10PM.

As of October 2017, this place seems to now be closed, which in a way I'm not surprised...every time I came here, I seemed to only 1 of 3 customers at lunch time.

I don't have any complaints about the yogurt, teas, or food. I like that this place is walking distance from work, so I did enjoy coming here for lunch. I would usually order the huge 1 pound wraps that were a little bigger than the size of my two fists. Everything about it tasted fresh, though sometimes I did feel like I ate too much (1lb in one sitting lol), and wish there was a smaller version. There were plenty of options for yogurt and toppings, and plenty of options for tea. The boba was the right consistency, not mushy or hard.

Anyway, I think the business would have been more successful if the parking lot had an exit at the end so a right turn can be made behind the building (there is already an access road there for other businesses behind Bee&Tea), and from there one could turn onto North Main. As it is, the parking lot force turns you into the awkward Geary Rd, where you then have to go into the Sprouts parking lot and exit their back way to turn into the reverse direction of Geary Rd in order get back onto North Main or Treat Blvd.

I hope this is not the end for Bee & Tea, as I do miss having lunch here.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<text>They are awesome here!! Our Daughter got a last minute toothache two days before Christmas we called around many places and got turned away. When I called here and explained the situation the girl that answered the phone said they were all booked but she had her son scheduled for a cleaning and she said we could have his appointment time. WOW!! I was shocked how sweet she was!! It didn't stop there their office is nice and welcoming. Turns out our daughter needed her baby tooth pulled and he did it same day!! Such an awesome team and just flat out great people!! They saved our daughter from being in pain during Christmas! Thanks guys!!!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>First off I want to say how great the front office staff were. They were so welcoming and friendly! My children both got put in the no cavity club my son who is 7 wasnt feeling scared for once he was actually happy the dental assistants were making him feel good. This place is just awesome all around. And a big thanks to Dr. Katy Rosen! She's the best! Unlike other pediatric dentist I been to for my children she's the most informative trustworthy and nice doc we could have!<//Review>< rating>

I was looking for a pediatric dentist near town and after reviewing their reviews I decided to give them a shot and I was not disappointed.

I called to get an appointment for my son and the front desk was extremely helpful over the phone and what was my favorite thing was that they text me to confirm the appointment and emailed me as well. Also, I really appreciated the link to fill out the new patient forms, that for me was awesome especially since I have two kids that was extremely helpful and it got it out the way for our scheduled appointment.

We arrived to our appointment and I think we waited less than two minutes and my son and I went in, he of course went to the small kids door which was pretty neat and I went thru the adult door. The whole experience was great. Robin catered to his needs of comfort and explained everything to him. After he got seen he was able to get a free toy as a reward for being good for his visit.

My son is 3 so this great for a parent of  two young children. He really became so comfortable that he liked her and was sad to leave.

Also, the cost for the initial visit was  explained very thoroughly and any other questions I had were answered. The front desk was extremely friendly and outgoing.

They have a tv for them to watch while their little teeth are being examined and there's a a little area in the lobby area for kids to play.

Me as a parent I also wanted to make sure I can be there for him when he gets examined, x ray, cleaning and I'm glad they allow that it puts me at ease.

I really recommend them! Our first time went great  and I can't wait for my little one to go here too.</Text>

Bay Area Kids Dentist is amazing.  The Dentists are very gentle with my twins, they are informative along the way, they take the least invasive route for treatment, and you can see that they enjoy working with kids.  I have experienced the staff at both Morgan Hill and the Santa Clara offices and they are great.  They also enjoy working with kids and have a gentle touch.  The hygienists are so informative as they work on the kids, they talk to the kids as they go and explain every step.  My kids will be patients at BAKD until they tell us they are too old.  I highly recommend this practice.
Also, they offer sedation dentistry, My son is highly anxious and sedation dentistry has been a blessing for him and our family.<//review>

We're late because we were lost and yet the office accommodated us. The wait was just reasonable. Our kids did enjoy the ambience and thrilled to have some sort of entertainment while getting serviced. Aids were nice, jolly and looked passionate with what they do. Of course, the toys and simple presents took big part of their excitement. We always thought of having a pediatric dentist for our children because the difference is very obvious. We want someone who can really takes care of their dental needs and overall health. Last of all, the doctor was showing his expertise and was listening to our concerns and some other issues. Our kids will definitely love and long for this place. 👍😀</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
This office is AMAZING! My 5 year old was dramatically afraid of the dentist because his previous experiences were horrible. But as soon as we walked in I could tell his anxiety was eased. The waiting room has a lot of activities for kids to do while they wait their turn. I especially loved that they have a chalkboard that says "Welcome" with the kids' names on it. The wait time was not very long at all. The entire staff was super friendly and helpful. The assistant who worked with my son really took the time to explain what each tool was used for and what she was going to do when she cleaned his teeth. His other office never did that! It really made him comfortable knowing what was going to happen and to know that the tools were not going to hurt him. He even got to watch a movie while he was getting his cleaning. Dr. Radwan himself was very friendly and very knowledgeable. When the kids are all done with their visit they get to pick out a toy. Overall I was extremely pleased with the visit and am glad I finally found a dentist that my son will enjoy seeing every 6 months!< /Review>

The visit experience was awesome and my 3 year old was treated with much respect. The only down fall is I was there 12/6 and as of today no call back from the front office to schedule his surgery and my poor baby has been crying with a toothache. Thank God!, for Oragel and Tylenol.<//Text>

When we started seeing Dr. Radwan 4 years ago, my then 7 yr old daughter had extreme dental related fears.  The staff has worked hard over the years to increase her comfort, always working very patiently with her. My other, typical children have had a great experience with this office as well.< /review>

This is by far the best pediatric dental facility I have ever seen. The staff are great and Dr. Radwan is so wonderful with the kids. He also took the time to explain why my daughter got  cavities even though we were brushing twice per day. He showed me how to brush her teeth more effectively, and did not rush to do any work that may not be necessary.
As for the facility, they have a small child door for the kids to walk through to the dental room, plenty of toys in the waiting room, and a tv playing some popular Disney movie. After they sit on the chair, they get to choose a Disney movie to watch (Frozen is very popular!) My 4 year old daughter was actually excited about going back a second time! I couldn't ask for a better place. Thank you!</Text>

< Review>
Excellent from the time we walked in.  My daughter Angelina said 6 month is to long to return for her next visit.  She never wants to go anywhere else but here for her Dental work.. She exclaimed!   She really liked her Dr.  She was hoping for a woman before we walked in but as soon as she was done with her visit with Dr Radwan she was convinced that she had found th perfect Doctor :) thank you!< /Review>

We love Dr. Radwan and his entire staff! This is like Disneyland of Dentist Offices.  Everything is tailored towards a child!  From the moment you walk into the office to the b=very end the focus is on your child.  The staff speaks their language, explains everything, takes the fear out of everything and my son loves going!  He remembers little things too, like this summer when Pokemon Go first came out they set up a Pokemon hunt inside the waiting room with a checkoff sheet and gave out little prizes.  They truly think of everything! I can't sing your praises enough!

My daughter first visit was great! The dentist was very kind and took the extra time to make my kid feel comfortable and explain each tool to her in a fun way. On top of that there was alot of fun little games and activities for her in the waiting room and everyone was really ver nice. It was a very positive expeiriance, and tbh we cant wait to go back in 6 months.</Text>

I wish I knew of this practice sooner. My son needs extensive dental work and Dr. Radwan has been a Godsend. My son feels comfortable and as crazy as it may seem, even asks when he gets to see the dentist. This has not always been the case. I will continue to take my son here. Dr. Radwan has proved to be extremely thorough and has helped my son get over his fear of the dentist in just a few visits. And, he's helped me get over my anxiety as well by asking how I would like to approach each visit (not common with all practices). I highly recommend Dr. Radwan!<//review>

<text>The assistant manager has no professional skills at all. It took and hour and a half to get me two pizzas and i called twice to complain. He a
Said he couldn’t do anything for me. He actually hung up on me. BTW, this is the first review I’ve ever left. I felt compelled because of his incompetence. I literally live 3 minutes from the business. If i was the manger or assistant manager i would’ve gotten in my own car and delivered the pizza. I guess dominoes doesn’t mean satisfaction guaranteed on their national commercials.

<text>Wow!  Clean, beautiful, it's actually fun, unlike anything I've ever seen in a Domino's store.  Ordered 5 pizzas and picked them up in about 25 minutes.  Pizza was fresh, toppings perfect, overall a great experience.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
This store struggles every time I've ordered, the people I talk to act completely clueless. I'm sick of it, I called three times and was put on hold then they hung up on me each time, the second time the lady lied to me and said she was unable to find my order after giving my number. I am so sick of dealing with the BS that comes every time I order from this store.
To top it off my pizzas have been in quality check for the last 2 hours. Lucky they have the Domino's name because any local place this poor wouldn't be in business long< /Review>

< Review>
Manager Rani was very disrespectful to my wife after my wife asked had explained to her that the a promo for a pizza wasn’t working online. Rani told us there wasn’t anything that she can do. After a little argument Rani hung up the phone on my wife. 5 min later I called with my own number it took them 10 times til they picked up the phone. After answering the phone to me Rani wanted to start an argument with me I stopped her immediately and told her I called her on a different number 10 times so why didn’t she pick up? Her response was that my wife was disrespectful to her. I told her but I’m calling under a different number and not only that I’m a different customer so I shouldn’t  be greeted  immediately with an argument. At the end after everything was done I put in the order I told her and I quote “look before I let you go now that I’m having a bad day I ask for a request. Can you write a yo mama joke on the boxes” was told no we don’t do that. I’ve worked in a lot of customer service jobs and I the was I was treated personally was dealt inappropriate and unprofessional.< /Review>

The Pizza was stuck on "checking quality" for over an hour and when called the person who picked up lied and said that the pizza was out and on the way when it wasn't. Called a second time when the tracker said it was delivered and was told it was coming out of the oven now and being made and sent out.

2+ hours of no pizza. We'll see if it ever arrives.<//Text>

This location is AWESOME. I was always a pizza hut person until recently. I think I only had Dominos (not this location) once about 20 years ago and I didn't like it. But, we decided to give them a try about two months ago and we've been ordering weekly, pretty much, ever since. Their pizza is good!!! I don't know why people even bother with Little Cesars when they can get Dominos, which is 100× better.
Anyway, this location is incredibly fast with delivery and they haven't made any mistakes yet. Their food is good too! Highly recommended. The coupons are GREAT. $5.99 for medium pizzas and pasta, you can't beat that. WAY better than spending $40-$45 for a medium or large pizza at roundtable (They mess up orders constantly!) and Dominos sauce doesn't give me heartburn like Roundtable's does. Dominos good still tastes good the next day as well!</review>

<text>So I'm not the typical online Groupon grabbing coupon clipping point napping guy. I tried to get a Groupon for this outing, can I find so difficult to get the right location to get the right pizzeria to get the right combination of foods that will make the Groupon work that I just gave up. Also tried online coupon codes this time also to no avail and I tried ordering on the app online and picking up all right this was exceptionally difficult too many choices too many things to pick and miss the deals basically.

So I ended up going inside the store myself once inside the store I managed to tell the guy how is this possible you guys are advertising for $699 an item and I'm ending up with a $48 bill impossible correct? so he proceeded to guide me and everything came out just fine I ordered the wings two sets unfortunately the wings were like the size of my fingernail! I also ordered two pizzas one medium and one large those are decent I'm not going to give them five stars but I'll give them three and finally I ordered a pasta dish that was really good I'll give that pasta dish five stars so the wings one or two stars tops pizzas two or three stars tops the pasta definitely go get them.

Overall experience I'm going to give it two stars</text>< pics>

What a joke! Placed an order through the app for ONE pizza and some breadsticks. It took almost an hour to “cook” according to the tracker. Once it left the store it was another hour before it actually got to my sisters hospital room. When he finally got here, they didn’t have any of the sauces we paid for. And during this entire ordeal, I called the store FIVE times and no one ever answered. Just the worse experience ever.< /text>

< Review>
Worst dominoes around.
Like literally the worst dominoes I've been to in the entire country.
They never get your order correct, and never refund missing items or bring them in a second trip.
Order from a different dominoes. These guys suck.

Wow, go figure. The review from before is still accurate.
Honestly garbage, and they never even try to correct their errors. Good luck calling them - I've spent the last 30 minutes on hold, and then was hung up on. Great service..

Spend your money elsewhere. Mountain Mike's is good I hear< /Review>

I just bought an $18 medium pan pizza and it is literally the same taste and quality as a regular pizza from Pizza Hut for $8. My suggestion: don’t waste your money ordering from here and get Pizza Hut instead.</Review>

Today our pizza was exceptionally delicious!
Our medium bacon and cheese pan pizza was only $2.00 after using our 60 points and was delivered hot and fresh as always.

It was checked for "perfection" at 6:38, and went out for delivery after sitting for **43 minutes**. Arrived at my door at 7:47 - 47 minutes after it was meant to, and 1h 9min after it was out of the oven. I called the location, no answer for 15 minutes. I called customer service who passed along the message to them since they are privately owned (Domino's main couldn't do anything apparently). Once I finally got through to the store again, they offered some bread sticks.. Seriously? After pushing on speaking to someone who could do better, that turned into a free large pizza. That will be the last order that goes to this location. It doesn't get worse than this location.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Worst dominos. They messed up my order and told me that they wrote a note attached to my phone number for a remake of the same order. When I called tonight I stayed on hold for about 20 minutes and was told very rudely that there was nothing like this attached to my phone number. Will never return to domino's. You can thank this location and its employees for that.</Text>

<text>The Monday through Thursday carryout special is basically what we get here for our kids. A step above the "pizza pizza" carryout special from other places. We use the app to earn free pizzas. Orders are usually fast, but if we happened to get there before they're done and the kids can write on the chalkboard as well as play Jenga. You can also watch the pizzas being made.< /text>< pictures>

<date>1472853413674< /date><Rating>1</Rating><review>this was hands down the most disappointing experience I've ever had when it came to ordering food. I ordered a medium half cheese half pepperoni pizza online. I kept tabs on the tracker every 5 minutes so I knew when I expected it to come. everything came around the time it was promise. I ordered the pizza, a 2 liter soda and 16 Parmesan bread bites. The bread bites were fine as well as the 2 litter but the pizza... oh my god this was the most poorly made pizza I've ever seem. right after opening the box I noticed that there was only a few slices of pepperoni on the half I said. that was extremely disappointing, but then I look over on the cheese side. I'm not sure what this is, but there was some type of large black burnt flakes all over the top of the cheese half and under the cheese. the entire bottom of the dough wasn't cooked and j could feel and see that it wasn't. the edge of the crust which would've touched the pan was burnt. I'm not happy with this. when I called the location they said I could choose between a free pizza or a coupon for my next order to be free. only reason I choose the coupon was because I didn't want to wait another 2 hours for my pizza to be delivered.

overall, never ordering from this location again. I hope you go out of business :)<//review>< Pictures>

<rate>5<//rate><text>The pizza we ordered online came on time. The delivery woman came to our apartment door, which was nice of her. I ordered the Wisconsin Six Cheese specialty pizza because I love cheese pizza, but I also have a zest for life. As far as cheese pizzas go, I have not had a better one. The cheese (so much cheese) was cooked so perfectly: melty and stringy when pulled from the pie, with a golden brown layer that had a toasted flavor. When I took a bite, I pulled it away from my face and stared at the slice, so confused. Why all the one-star nonsense in the reviews? My pizza was retardedly good.

My boyfriend ordered a supreme. I quote: "yeah, it's as good as any other supreme. Pretty good. Try to say that in a nice way. Better than Pizza Hut, so..."

I tried the supreme, myself. It was, indeed,  pretty good.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

They gave me a burnt pizza. Offered a new one in 30-45 minutes or a Credit. I requested the credit, rather than the inconvenience. Only for someone to come banging, unannounced, on the door, with an unrequited pizza. I stopped the delivery man, while my Boyfriend called the store AGAIN. We offered to give the pizza back, but they refused to take it back. My fridge isn't that big! We didn't want another pizza, just the credit, which they never gave.< /Review>

<review>STORE IS FINALLY CLOSED!!!
Been buying cheap pies here for the last year with so-so service and so-so pies. But hey, can't beat the low prices. Guess the low prices finally put them under. How can you stay in business selling $6 and $8 pies?!?

Went to the other dominos a mile away on Branham Lane. Service was great, welcomed with a smile, pie made in 10 minutes. Hope they say in business, I'll be back.< /review><user_name>Scott Simpkin< /user_name>< resp>

Don’t come here. The employee came back from break to help with my order, and I watched him “wash” his hands with no soap. Then the other employee grabbed the pasta for the pasta dish with his bare hands, no gloves. I’m pretty sure that is a health code violation. Disgusted.</Review>

Terrible terrible service! Very rude when taking my order. When the elder man working was putting toppings on peoples pizza while using his cell phone then put his cell phone away and continued to put toppings on pizza after I saw this I told them I want my money back and why I wanted my money back they refused to give me money back and argued with me about the situation.. never coming back!!<//review>

The negative reviews are absolutely correct... Placed an order online. Waited for over 1 and 45 mins... made multiple phone calls asking for updates.
We will not order from this place again. I am really surprised they are in business.</review>

WORST SERVICE OF MY ENTIRE LIFE! I ordered online and paid with credit card. Never received my pizza. No refund...

The delivery guy (Son according to the tracker) called 30mins after the tracker said it was out for delivery, was super rude af yelling for my apt # even though I wrote it twice on the online form. 15 more minutes pass, he calls again, I hear another phone ring he tells me to hold on while he talks to someone else in a different language and then proceeds to hang up on me!

I call the store, he answers!! Meaning he went back without delivering my pizza! First thing he says without even knowing who I am or why I am calling is not hello or thanks for calling dominos. He yells "WE'RE CLOSED" This is ridiculous. I tell him I already had ordered online and never received my pizza and ask to speak to a manager. He yells that he's cancelling my order and then hangs up on me... I keep calling back and he literally keeps picking up and immediately hanging up....

WORST SERVICE EVER SERIOUSLY. I've been a loyal customer for years to the Branham store (best service) but the online form won't let me order from there anymore for some reason. I really wish they would because the Branham store is always delicious, speedy, and have best customer service.

Dominos, seriously "Son" should be fired, he makes your store look not only unprofessional but rude and I won't be ordering from this Domino's ever again!< /text>

Worst one ever!  You go in there are multiple people working there you'll be in line waiting to order literally 3 people walked away from their registers.  While I was leaving the store none of them even acknowledged me.  Very disappointed this place needs to be shut down.< /Text>

I was had insurance through this company for a couple years. They were the worst ins company I'd ever dealt with. They spelled my name wrong I told the, they said they would fix it and they didn't until the 3rd time I told them over a few months. They put the wrong Vin number into their system so I got a letter from the DMV saying I wasn't covered. I told them, they fixed it and when it was time to start the new policy, they did it again. This also happened 3 times. Many times, I would call, they would put me on hold for half an hour or more, then tell me they were closed or just hang up on me. Then I got married, my husband moved from out of state so I put him on my ins, they never asked how long he had been driving (even though I told them he had a license in his old state) so they put him down as a new driver and we paid hundreds of dollars over what we should have before figured out why. When I told them, they just said "Oh, okay." and reduced out monthly payments for a few months. I also tried calling to make payments on the days they were due and because it was a weekend, they never answered the phone, so I would have a late fee because  I had to call that following Monday.Then they spelled my name wrong again. I tried being understanding, but it was over and over. Now they want to charge me for canceling my policy with them a year ago, sent it to collections, and never even tried contacting me to settle this issue. They are unprofessional, illiterate, moronic people who don't know how to run a company. I would never recommend anyone to to to them.

DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS!!!<//Text>

Natalie from Omni Safe Ins. Has been so helpful with finding me a policy I can afford. She's been patient and very polite. I appreciate it so much, every other insurance rep. I've spoken to has always been so rude, pushy, and I'll mannered. So Thank you Natalie for the great customer. Look forward to doing business with Omni Safe Auto Insurance.< /Text>

<text>After a streak of bad luck my driving record was horrendous. I reached out to Omni Safe in hopes I wouldn’t have to Literally take out a loan to afford insurance. Fernando Gonzales was the agent who assisted me and I could have never asked for a more cool, calm, and collective insurance agent who was straight to the point, understanding and knew exactly what I needed to get me back on the road on a budget and I couldn’t thank him enough! I would recommend anyone and everyone to Fernando and Omni safe insurance. Thank you!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80ea6a9e9eeaf5dd:0xfe79d588c59936c1</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The agents are helpful and friendly.   The company itself is kind of messed up  ...maybe due to Covid.  They canceled me and didn't notify me by email to say anything was wrong.   Yes, it messed up my coverage.  I will likely look around for another company.<//Text><time>1594139157804<//time><resp>None<//resp></record>

Very friendly staff! Found me great prices for full coverage

Update: after having my insurance cancelled for personal reasons they were able to find me a better insurance rate at a lower price and it was all done through the phone and on my own time. Very satisfying service.</text>

Recommended by my car dealership salesman. Signing up over the phone was a breeze! Had insurance within minutes. Was quoted 45$ more through other ins. Agencies, so I feel like I got a great deal overall</text>

I have had insurance through Omni Safe about 13 yrs. With multiple cars at a time. I get just what I need at a great price. I 've had at least one major claim. They took care of me no delay. Highly recommend Omni Safe. Best deals they find it. Thanks</text>

<Review>Roman at Omni Safe is one of the most honest, thorough, helpful, and enthusiastic agents I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He has many a times gone above and beyond to find me (and everyone that I've referred) the most affordable and reliable coverage. He is a committed agent, always willing to work hard for his customers to find the best fit insurance product. He and his staff are a wonderful crew that will always come through.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Everything so far has been fast and smooth, but it's been a couple hours since they said the paperwork would be emailed over. We'll see how long it actually takes.<//text>

<Text>Never get insurance here! Rebecca quoted me 290 a month  but once I signed the deal it went from 290 to 400+ dollars! What a scam! And there’s nothing she can do about it? What a lie never trust these people! Either you pay or they cancel your car insurance<//Text>< Response>

I love coming here, and to their original churreria (which is right down the street). The personnel is always friendly and the place is always clean! The small parking lot is a little inconvenient, but I don't mind too much as most people are in and out in less than 10 min. And they always have the mini cakes, which we buy at least 4 times a year. Today I purchased a 3 leches mini cake to celebrate my son's birthday. Looks so yummy, and it is very cute!</Text>

The bread is BOMB! I have plenty of bakeries around my house, but I rather come down here to BG and get me some of THIS bread! 😁 Good prices on the bolillos, plenty of parking space, and the customer service is very good. 👍🏽👍🏽< /Review>

<review>This is the local place to get churros, they are second to none. Yes, the carry Mexican pastries  (pan dulce) & cakes. They're specialty are the churros and the champurrado  (Mexican chocolate).

Very reasonably priced, expect long lines on cold days.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Churros are 0.50 each! These churros aren't small at all. They're the size of the ones they sell at concession stands. They also sell churro rellenos which is churros filled with chocolate, cream, vanilla or guava for $1.50.

The churros are warm and covered in cinnamon sugar. Texture is good but just a bit hard .. not as soft and fresh like what I'm used to. But it is better than what you can find at amusement parks and WAY cheaper.

Parking here is TERRIBLE. Only 3-4 spots and you basically have to go in and back out the entrance to exit.<//Review>

As of Mar. 2021 this location is open. I called to try to make an appointment and was told they aren't taking appointments. I would be waiting outside with 4 people in line. I decided to go again a less busy time and walked into the salon. The stylist then told me to wait outside. After some minutes they told me to come in and asked for my name. I thought they were going to take me as a walk in but they simply told me "Online". I asked "online what?", and was told "online.". "Are you asking me to make an appointment online? Online where, on your website?". I kid you not the only thing this person could tell me was "online". Another customer told me they're doing online check-ins only through their website, which was the first complete sentence I heard in the salon. The person I originally called didn't mention any of this. What a huge waste of time. Go somewhere else.< /text>

<Time>1605761744510</Time><Rating>5</Rating><text>Teresa is my very, very, very favorite. I love that I don't have to make an appointment per se.  Everything is clean and cheerful. Prices are sooo low. They work hard, do their best to accomodate customers, and the quality is comparable to expensive salons (actually better). Teresa is supreme. :) Also, I've been there several times and have had a great experience every time. Definitely recommend. Parking is also spacious, and area feels quite safe.<//text>< pics>

< Review>
Got a haircut today and when I looked at the back in the hair stylist mirror I wasnt sure if it was a glare or the lighting that made it look weird but turns out when I got home and looked I had several bald patches instead of a fade and the line is not even close to straight. Made me so sad, the lady that cut my hair was really nice but this is the worst haircut I've ever ever had.< /Review>

< Review>
I checked in 20 min before I arrived today after website said 18 min wait time and the guy that walked in after me got to go first because he was before me on the list. I then waited 20 min for him to finish and in the meantime another lady walked in, when the man was done the lady was called to the back and the employee said to me "sorry she was before you on the list, I hope you don't mind being patient." No it's okay man I'll just wait here and be late for work. Walked out and took the money I was about to spend on an overpriced haircut somewhere else. Completely unprofessional. Two people working when there should be five. Absolute JOKE OF A BUSINESS. Will never be returning to Great Clips.< /Review>

This used to be an amazing great clips location, but recently with the change of hair stylists, I have received far too many sub par haircuts. The cuts are not straight and your hair could end up looking like modern art.<//text>

This barber shop has a proud female hairdresser who walks around leisurely and didn’t  cut my hair.  The other two male barbers can only cut long hair, but there is no hairstyle at all, and the two of them can’t cut the lady's hairstyle at all.  A very bad experience, never go again.</review>

<Text>This location is like brand new after re-opening.  I went there with $6.99 coupon of re-opening special.  I had cut my hair really short almost a month back.  My hair grows on sides fast so want to take a trim.  Stylist Christine was really good.  She asked me whether I want to repeat the previous short cut I took.  When I told her my intentions of just a trim she ended up giving me a good blended trim cut.  She also suggested me a good styling cream which is on sale at the store with demonstration.  I am impressed.  Definitely going back to this place for my next haircut and that too with Christine....</Text>< pictures>

For me personally it definitely  was a good experience. I went two times in this place and was fully satisfied. While reading comments I got disappointed, because it is truly a good place, and my barber was a very skillful person, who knows well how to keep up a conversation. Anyway, I hope a lot that all the barbers that deserve to be faired will eventually get kicked out, because they ruin reputation of such a nice haircut salon.< /Review>

Disaster! The so called "stylist" did not understand what I said and cut my hair as he deems OK. Worst, when I complain about the result to the manager, he claimed that he did not cut those parts of my hair. Of course he cannot explain the difference between how it was in the morning and how it was after his disastrous cut. The manager was nice to me. She understood the problem and apologized. She also suggested to call for the manager before the hair cut if you think or feel the stylist did not understand you descriptions. A good advice to avoid disasters.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Horrible place with horrible barbors (at least mine). They get mad if you tell them what to do and, eventually give you a bad haircut. They have no respect for their customers. Also, take 18 bucks for all of that. There are way better places within .5 miles from there who are way better and less expensive. Highly encourage you to go there.<//review>< pics>

<review>This place is a hit or a miss based on who the stylists are. Their online check-in system is the most weird and often misleading based on how stylists use it. I urge the proprietor to seriously bring a consistency to how this online check-in is implemented across all stylists on site to avoid frustration for customers.
Here is an example:
I check-in with wait time of 60 min. About 45 min later wait time is 0 min on the app, so I am at the place. Wait time is still 0 min. I check-in but I happen to be 5th on the online waitlist with top 4 NOT checked in. They ask me to wait. As she is about to take me to her styling booth, another person walks in. She decides to check him in. He ends up being #4 on the list, so now she decides to work on him and make me wait. How is that for a great Consumer experience!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I've been to the new Great Clips twice, I have been very happy with the cut Briann created for me.  I have very thin hair and she was able to give me a cut that looks great and I feel like I have hair. The stylist that work their are extremely friendly and make you feel welcomed.< /text>

I really appreciate the manager who took care of the situation, obviously she can't reverse the mess up made by this hopeless guy. But she tried her best and offered coupons for the next visits to fix it as much as possible.

Except the manager if you get anyone else, be aware of the stylist and don't regret later.</text>< Pics>

My boyfriend just returned from getting a haircut from Vu at Great Clips. Vu "slipped" shaved a giant chunk out of my boyfriends beard and now he has to shave it off. And they actually charged him for the haircut!! Unbelievable. Great Clips is terrible. If you're a guy, go to Roosters. They are a bit more expensive but you get what you pay for.< /text>

Worst haircut ever. The "stylist" ignored my comments and gave me a haricut completely different from what I asked. Even when I asked him to stop cutting, he insisted to continue cutting his way.<//Review>

Beautiful lay out for an art exhibit at the fair, fine acoustics as evidenced by the percussion band performing over the weekend we visited. They had the doors open at both ends so there was good air flow. The loo was clean, well stocked and there are plenty of stalls. There is wheelchair accessibility and wide halls for them to move around.<//Review>

The show we saw was great, but the venue left a lot to be desired. The seats are quite old. Entering and exiting was not done in an orderly way. Leaving the parking lot was a nightmare. There is much room for improvement as a venue for large events.< /Review>

To front entry, to rear entry - performer drop off etc.</Review>

The movie screen was small for the space. We came here to see a screening of Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan and Bill Shatner.
While we enjoyed the show, the venue could use some work.the movie screen was small for the space. The sound was pretty bad. This space likely hasn't changed since the 1950's.</Review>

<Time>1442182208399< /Time><Rate>4< /Rate><review>Great venue with plenty of parking.  The auditorium is located right next to a small lake/park.  The seating was spacious with plenty of leg room.  We were there for the Bob Woodward lecture as part of the Marin Speaker Series.

I was a bit disappointed by Bob Woodward.  I expected Woodward to provide his take on the NSA snooping, drum beats to war with Syria, etc.  And doing so, perhaps, share some valuable nuggets of insider information that will help us to cut through the hot smoke of demagoguery.  Instead, the lecture was an off-the-cuff, stream of the consciousness affair.  It was more about his experience rubbing elbows with the Washington elite.  I disagree his view that the "fiscal cliff" was the result of the politicians unable to reach a compromise.  In any case, in my opinion, the journalist who broke the Watergate story is now part of the Washington establishment.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

< Review>
This is Marin's only large auditorium to see anyone involved in music, drama or comedy.  Greatest event that goes each year here is Singers Marin annual Holiday Concert. Comprised of four adult groups, four youth groups on stage singing the traditional, standard holiday music along with selections for the Hanukkah season.  Last year they did a few gospel tunes which brought the house down.

I always tell people if this don't put you in the holiday spirit than nothing will.

I've gone every year and it's an incredible show! Get your tickets to their show called, Tis The Season Cheers!  You won't regret it!<//Review>

Decent venue. Fair amount of space between chairs and rows. Many seats for people with disabilities. Parking is somewhat limited. There is only one single-lane road connecting this venue with the rest of the Marin county. Expect 10-15 min delays in post concert traffic.< /text>

Last night's Ina Garten event was extremely disappointing— in fact a rip off for what it cost. The program started late and ended early. The video screen was not used so those in the back needed a telescope. I hope the moderator's cooking is nowhere near as bland as her performance. I know what knives to buy, but have no insight into the Barefoot Contessa.<//review>

<Text>Just had my first experience at this venue and I would say it's just okay. The place is huge for a veterans memorial hall and the outside and grounds are beautiful.

Appearance wise, It looks very nice inside as well, but the parking is ridiculous for sold out performances. We had to go  blocks away from the venue to get a space in one of their "onsite" lots, but did everyday find one. After the show it was a standing traffic jam to get out, which took close to an hour.

The Box Office line was a block long and under staffed, leaving many of us who came "early" rushing to get to our seats before the performance began. They definitely have "nose bleed" seats in this auditorium, high enough that you have a little trouble hearing the lower speaking on stage and you can see the performers, but not their facial details.

The Seats themselves were not very comfortable, but they did have ushers to help you find yours in the darkened theatre.

Not anxious to see another performance here, but It's give it one more try before giving up on it.<//Text>< Date>

<Name>Johnny Wang</Name><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>My first experience with the MVMA (and Marin, for that matter) was a mere two months ago or so, coming up this way for a Jake Shimabukuro concert with a girl I was dating at the time. If you've never heard of the man, Youtube him: he does magic with a ukulele!

While positive overall, I did have a few mixed opinions about the venue. Let's start with the most important part of a venue for a musical performance: the sound system and setup here was fantastic. For those who care about lighting and effects, theirs were also surprisingly nice: no, not EDM show level impressive, but, very nice for small and solo acts.

As for the venue itself, while the outside and lobbies were quite nice, a careful glance around the auditorium itself showed that the place was definitely a little dated. To each their own on how to react to that: perhaps it's nostalgic and has character - to me, it just felt a little old and worn. That aside, the interior is fairly spacious, and performances without many (or any) intermissions won't notice that the two lobbies on either side are actually quite small, which was only noticeable to us because of the meet and greet Jake did after the show.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - For a venue of their size, I was actually a little surprised at the amount of accessible wheelchair seating they had. Located roughly in the middle of the auditorium, where one of the main walkways was, were a smattering of spaces designated as wheelchair... parking spaces, if you will, with some adjacent seating reserved for accompanying guests.

Bathroom - I believe there were a set of bathrooms on each side of the auditorium. Either way, there is at least one that is perfectly accessible.</text><gmapID>0x808599d4c457465f:0x15468ca1c8b12e87< /gmapID>< date>

Definitely not crowded.  This care wash does a great service.  My car was vacuumed and cleaned inside as well as outside.  When finished it looked like a new car!< /Review>

I had to keep telling them what to do. The inside was not clean at all. Did not even vacuum or wipe the seats down. The outside had all kinds of smear marks. Not worth $75 for sure..Will not return !< /review>

<Text>Not very friendly and it seem like they were in a hurry and all they cared about was getting me to pay lot of money which they make it sound like they are giving me a deal by lowering cost about $10-$15 bucks. They were really busy though. If you do go double check their work and make sure you get what you pay for. Probably look for a mobile detailer.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Great wash.  I have an older car and Taylor did a great job in wiping and cleaning the different areas where there were stubborn spots. My car has never been cleaner and it was spotless when I drove out of the lot! Definitely will return.  Friendly people and great customer service. Highly recommend Body Beautiful Car Wash.<//review>< Pictures>

There were no other cars there then mine and the car barely looked clean on the inside. My car is new and so it's very clean but I can still see spots on the inside as if they didnt even wipe down the console or door jam . Wasnt expecting a detail but for $30.00 I would expect a wiped down interior. Next time I will drive further for better service.</Review>

My husband took my car in to be detailed as a birthday gift and I was not impressed.  For $250 I expected it to be perfect.  They did not get the edges of the windows and I found other places they had not cleaned.  I could dismiss the bad job and just never go back, but one of the products they used really smells horrible to me.  I've wiped down the inside to try to get rid of the smell and the slick oily feel on all the plastic.  That helped a bit, but I'm very disappointed and driving around with my windows down hoping that the smell goes away soon!< /Review>

I’m being generous with the three stars. I’ve lived here in Poway since 95 and have been coming here the whole time. I have to say in the last year or so, the quality of car washes has been getting worse. The attention to detail is horrible. You spend $30 for a deluxe wash and it should be just that.

This place has a lot of new younger kids handling sales and the detail work. The lack of motivation and work ethic is terrible. I talked to long time counter person Lisa who is great. She introduced me to Alex one of the managers. Alex was awesome and handled himself very professional.

Alex listened to my concerns and asked me which car was mine. Alex jumped on it and had this thing looking better than it has been in a while. When my car was done Alex shook my hand and gave me a coupon for a free deluxe wash a $30 value. Alex you’ve earned my respect my friend. Alex gets five stars in my book. Thank you<//review>

The guys washing my car did a good job on my car and I didn't have to wait long, only thing is I was a bit uncomfortable once I went in to pay the gentlemen
running the register has the personality of a wet mop he can be or try  to be somewhat friendly so that people waiting on there cars aren't as uncomfortable.<//text>

I bought the mid grade car wash, which was around $23. Initially my car looked clean but the cleanliness only lasted a few days. My windows weren't thoroughly cleaned on the inside. I don't think any type of wax coat was applied. Therefore, my car picked up lots of dust and dirt from every day driving. I am disappointed 👎</Review>

<Review>They do an okay job with the car
I like that they pre-rince the car before sending it into the automatic wash. This reduces the paint damage. The car wash is not a very inviting place. The waiting area is outside, in direct sun and kind of dirty.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

One star off because inside the glove compartment was missed and it took a very long time to finish (3 hours).  Maybe the staff who signs you in could give at least a rough time estimate; that would be helpful. I will go back again!<//review>< username>

I was very pleased by my experience in the beginning. The cashier was very friendly and I really appreciated her kindness. I was ready to leave a 5 star review, until I got my car back from the supposedly "full service" carwash. I was far from impressed by the interior or exterior cleaning. Disappointing because I was looking for a go-to car wash place and this is definitely not it.<//Review>

Unfortunately I had a poor result from them. The outside of the car looked good, but they didn't even try to vacuum the dog hair off my back seat. I watched the man vacuuming and he literally looked at the back seat, and just shut the door! Didn't even attempt it. I ended up going to a do it your self place to vacuum my car myself afterwards, which is exactly what I didn't want to do and why I paid them to do it.</Review>

If this is all you have in this area, I am so sorry. I am from Central California. & if you pay this much for a car wash, you get a nice job. I tipped the worker's, pulled out of the way & used my own micro fiber towels to finish drying my truck, the mirror's still wet, the chrome wheels were a mess from the tire dressing. I went across the parking lot to parts store to buy glass cleaner to finish my truck  $22.99 + $3.00 tip for this so called car wash. They will not see me again. I liked the guy at the register  how he describe the kid who wrote up my order. The guy with the hat & long hair.
Soapy Joes car wash 15 min south, is $12.99, yes you have to vacuum, & use their microwave fiber towels suplied to dry your own car or truck.
I would rather do it my self and have it clean.< /Text>

Was not as clean as expected.   Walked around car pointing out obvious places not clean during wash or drying.   Chrome rims not cleaned.   Just an okay job.   That is why I do not usually Body Beautiful but my usual car wash was closed.  Recleaned rims at home.</Text>

<review>I think they do a very good job washing my vehicles.. I also do stand there watching with my tip in hand so they see it and know im going to be putting 💰 💰 in the tip jar..  I also think the service is just fine.. They are not rude and have always been very polite and nice to me... Also they don't let you leave unhappy one time the dust was blowing in the parking lot and they put all the cars back through or handed out rain checks... That is good service!!</review><UserId.>106331773921578057210<//UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics><date>1504381615277<//date>< name>

<review>As a first point of contact with the company, the ticket greeter Chris created a positive and lasting impression with the level of customer service I received. Comming to this location feels more like a luxury, rather than routine car maitnence (that would nornally get put off). I will definitely be a returning customer thanks to his professional charm!< /review>< Pictures>

Nice people, but poor quality. Paid for an ultimate wash and would have been better going to the CostCo drive-thru wash. Rums weren't fully cleaned, seats weren't fully vacuumed, glass wasn't even clean, and the sent they used smelled like cigarettes. I would not go back our recommend.</text>

<text>I paid for $120 for 4 services (hand wax, carpet, upholstery, and vinyl) for my car, and they told me it takes about one hour and half to finish the job, but after 2 hours when I called, they told me they just started the job and ask me to wait for another one hour and half since they were busy to serve the higher end car even though I got there the first one in the morning. When I talked to the manager about my concerns, he said " do not come back next time" in a rude way. Even the cashier's attitude was rude too. When I got home, I just noticed they did not do the hand wax at all. I felt I was cheated. Very bad service.<//text>< pictures>

Spent $150.00. Sat there for over two hours while they attended to higher end vehicles and spent a whole ten minutes on my 4runner. Worst place

The respect for their customers vehicles suck. Spent 135$ for a wax and detail and it was horrible. Came back the next day to show what was wrong and they said it wasn't there fault. Customer service sucks< /review>

From the moment my husband and I  walked in the door, I felt relaxed and valued. Dr Hallack and her team are outstanding! Dr Hallack listened to my concerns and was attentive to my needs.  I came in for full dentures and all I can say is “beautiful”! Fit like a glove. I am beyond happy! I love my Dentist, She is wonderful! I can’t recommend  K & H enough. My husband loves his as well! He is  always smiling now. Oh, and did I mention, I can chew on both sides now❤️< /text>

<review>I had my first visit here today, x-rays, a quick exam, and two extractions in under an hour. Very fast work, and after about 10 hours now, I still don't have much pain. Front desk staff was friendly and attentive, everyone who handled me was kind and caring through the whole appointment. I came in terrified and they made sure that I was comfortable and I really appreciate that.<//review>< pics>

At first they said they directly refunded my bank acct and I had not record of so on my bank statements. Then there was a procedure error on the billing side, which my insurance was able to verify and I still ended up overpaying for my procedure. It has been over a year and am still getting the run around, that their billing department is "figuring" it out. I've taken copies of my insurance statement and no call back nor a follow up. Aside from my refund, I have not even received a courtesy follow up to see how my post procedure was or if there were any issues with my dentures.

If I could give it 0 stars I would, my sister went there to get a tooth pulled out and once they gave her the numbing shot the doctor took the teeth out right away, he didn’t even give it time for the numbing to start. Now she’s in pain. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!<//text>

Do you dread going to the dentist?  Maybe even avoid routine dental care because you've had a bad experience before?  That was me, too. But not anymore!  My husband and I have both received wonderful care at K&H Dental.  Their staff is kind and encouraging.  I just went in this morning for TWO root canals and I experienced absolutely ZERO pain!  I was really nervous but they made me feel very comfortable and the procedure went so well.  I walked in with two really bad teeth, and I walked out with a beautiful smile!  My two new crowns look amazing and the best part is...they were fabricated IN-OFFICE and DURING my appointment!  I was very pleasantly surprised that they now offer that.  No temporary crown! I will be going back in for some more dental work soon and I no longer dread the experience.  I know K&H Dental will do another stellar job!  Thanks K&H! 😁😁😁< /text>

Had wisdom teeth removed as well as root canals with crowns done too. All was done professionally and the dentists were always looking out for my comfort during the procedures.

Building is clean and they even make the crowns there on site!< /Text>

<Review>Have been trying to get emergency dental work done for three months (I already had an evaluation appointment with them) and I can't even reach them. No emails or phones working. They might be closed because of COVID but they never gave me a notification that they can't do my work, or that they are in fact closed.<//Review>< Pictures>

The sweetest and most efficient dentists my family and I have ever had. I was really nervous to get my wisdom teeth taken out, but the whole process was quick and painless. Whether it is a cleaning or a procedure they always check up on you while doing their work to make sure you are doing okay which I really appreciate. A really clean and vibrant office that relax anyone. Free coffee in the front too :)< /Review>

<text>Omg let me tell you. I had really bad anxiety and i didn’t want to go to my extraction appt but trust me they were so comforting, so quick and painless! I had four teeth taken out and it was all done before I knew it. I am going to refer everyone here from now on. I thought I needed nitrous oxide or sedation but they proved me wrong. Thank you! They told me everything was going to be okay from the start. And they sure was right. I left with 4 teeth missing and smiling haha.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Looks like my original review was deleted!!! I had been a patient here for a few years. One day I went in for a cavity to be filled and left with a hole cut in my lip. Nobody said a word to me about it. When I got home I noticed blood in my mouth and then saw the actual hole/cut in my lip. Not very kind or professional. IF I COULD NO STARS FROM ME<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I was pretty nervous being scheduled for eleven extractions, yes, eleven. I wasn't sure how they would be done; over several visits or in one sitting, turns out it was the latter! The extremely kind, understanding, and accommodating staff managed to extract all eleven with no pain. Even more, they did it in about twenty minutes or so. Today is the day after and I'm still in no pain. The service here was great, prompt and professional. I would recommend this facility to anyone needing a great dental team.< /text>

I recently got my wisdom teeth removed here. Dr. Lojyn did an amazing  job numbing me, I felt absolutely nothing during the whole procedure and was very comfortable through it all.
Dr. Kaou removed all 4 of my wisdom teeth in 30 minutes with no pain!! These are definitely the best dentists you will ever meet. Great service with a very friendly and comfortable atmosphere. I would highly recommend this dental office for any of your dental needs!</Review>

This dentist place is a joke!. They pulled my husband’s wisdoms out Wich was good. But when it came to the other teeth he needed fixed. They sent in the wrong x rays. So we went in for new ones to send into dentical. Well they swore they knew Wich ones were fully needed. They semt in the wrong ones again. A whole pano Wich is not what medical needs, they only need those for dentures. That’s what medical said when I spoke to them. They needed individual x rays of the teeth. The last x rays before that all they did was zoom into the tooth and it came out blurry. And then the second time they asked for two crowns for the same tooth instead of the crown the root canal and the post. I really think these people are playing games just to charge medical for no good reason. Money comes out of people’s pockets for these x rays to be paid! They are a dentist and deal with medical they should know better! Please don’t waste your time! It’s been almost three months that my husband has been dealing with head aches from his teeth waiting for them just to make mistakes! GET YOUR Sh**! TOGETHER KH DENTAL!<//Review>

<review>The actual dentists are nice and seem to  be good dentists. The dental assistant were very  nice. But the office staff are horrible. I went in for a referral in May and they were supposed to submit to my insurance for approval, August 2nd came and I went in to find out about the approval and they said it was submitted I checked with my insurance company and was told they never submitted it. So I asked them to submit it again, called them back 10 days later they still hasn't submitted. Then when they did they messed up the authorization forms and it was denied. I call my insurance company and they said I needed new XRay's and the proper documentation submitted. Before I could go back in for the new XRay's they resubmitted the same again and was denied again.
Good luck getting these people on the phone
Good luck getting them to call you back
A very, very frustrating experience.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
Started coming here about a year and a half ago for a cleaning. Everytime I went in for a cleaning I always had perfect teeth and no cavities. Just recently I went in for a cleaning and was told I had a cavity and they had to fill it. The female dentist did the filling right then, she did not wait for me to get fully numb and she also told me that she was going to put a WHITE filling in for me and she did NOT.. Also, the tooth that she said I had a cavity in NEVER hurt or had any pain until after she did it. It’s been over a month and I still have pain where she did the filling.. I will not be going back and am currently looking for a new dentist..</review>

<text>This was My second visit, previously visited in November for some routine extractions clean facility. waiting time was short on both visits,had the    X-Ray's done and was talking to the dentist within a few minutes. after talking with him and explaining my issues he gave me multiple options I decided I wanted to have them extracted and he was more than willing to do it. Shortly after I was giving a shot and it numbed the area after  a minute he proceeded to get to work.  after only 2-3 minutes he was finished. Great work I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good dentist.< /text><Name>Kevin Driver< /Name><user_id>114863350618020076549<//user_id>< Date>

BE AWARE!!!

I had a bad experience with Doctor Lojayn. She broke my tooth as if she didn't know how to do her job! She also worked on another tooth that she wasn't even talled to work on. I would rate zero star if I could.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
K&H dental has been hands down the best dental experience of my life.

The staff is polite, cheerful and helpful, and the facilities are surprisingly comfortable. I've never had to wait much more than 10-15 minutes to be seen, and the doctor is extremely efficient and skilled.

My first visit, I had 5 teeth in need of extraction, most of which had become horribly infected and were excruciatingly painful. K&H was able to get me an appointment the same day in a little over an hour.  In about 5 minutes, they had me numbed up and comfortable. The doctor was with me 5 minutes after that, and had all my teeth extracted in under 10 minutes.

My next visit was for a root canal. I should mention that i have had two root canals in the past, and they were both long, uncomfortable, and painful experiences. Dr. Kaou was able to complete the procedure without any pain (aside from the novacaine shot) in about 20 minutes. 5 hours later, I can't even really tell I had any dental work done - it's not even a little sore.

I Strongly recommend K&H. They are skilled, polite, and professional.<//Review>

Was happy with my first few visits then I needed a simple check up cleaning by my ortho request I was turned away because Dr insist I needed a different cleaning that is $500 dollars when some can't pay that you have to work with what you can do.  So was turned away and now need to find a different dentist very upsetting just because its not what they want done they will turn you away. .</Review>

I had no pain or problems with my extractions he is a professional Pain-free dentistry and felt more like a spa than a dental office. I was made to feel welcome and comfortable by the staff and I would recommend Dr. Mohamed Kaou to everyone . He is the best dentist I have ever had.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This dental practice is discriminating against welfare patients who get referred . Took almost 7 weeks for an approval from medical-cal to get root canal . Come to find out medi-cal had approved the root canal weeks ago they just kept acting like they didn’t get it . Probably hoping I’d give up & go else where . Stupidly I waited only to come in today and get smart mouthed by the dentist who tried to speak to me like I was a 4 year old . Very rough stabbed my upper mouth with the needle so hard I cried . This is a warning to this dental practice I’m going to have my mouth looked at and photographed & I also will be pushing for an investigation of the discrimination against welfare patients !!!!! Terrible ! Nothing worse than having a dentist who wants to make it hard for you . When I had good insurance I have had a root canal with absolutely no pain some dentists care about there patients and are gently with the needle , to the point where you don’t feel nothing . This dentist wanted to hurt me . Sick people in this world ! Beware !!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dr. Mohammad and Dr. Lujyn are the best dentist will ever experience. First, all patients are seriously treated like family which make the atmosphere more comfortable. Dr. Mohammad is very professional and extremely patien and this is one of the things that makes him special. If you are anxious or you feel scared to visit a dentist, K & H is the right place to go. You will leave with no pain and satisfied.
PS: Clinic is super clean and elegant (like a SPA) and the staff are nice and friendly.< /Review>< resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I was looking for a new dentist because my insurance changed.  There were very few reviews available for K&H online at the time, but they were very positive, but the reviews were all on Facebook, so now I believe that they were able to delete the unfavorable reviews.  When I got to the office there was a man sitting in the waiting room watching TV, and there were no other clients (which should have given me a clue).  Come to find out, the man was the dentist!  My biggest complaint was that I specifically requested NOT to have Xrays done.  I brought Xrays from my previous dentist.  They insisted that new Xrays were necessary.  I acquiesced to having an Xray done, but the woman running the Xray machine did not know how to properly  do it.  SHE HAD TO REDO THE XRAY 3 TIMES!!!  Not only did I not want a single Xray, but I got triple the dose of radiation.  I was LIVID!!!  If I get a brain tumor, I know it came from there!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Worked here as an extern cleaned the entire time / sterilized everything & for the assistant by the name Monica to always criticize me poorly and talk down to me. Was never positive always negative ! I was nothing but helpful always wanted to do the job, but the Dentist would not let me assist them like i was supposed to be doing she was rude ! I was still in school at the time and they didn't teach me anything at all.... The assistant was extremely rude and gave me a grade i didnt deserve AT ALL even though i busted my ass to help them . She doesn't even do her job right in making appointments and cleanings! .Not to mention she isnt supposed to be doing half the things she does in the back! Do not trust these people and please don't ever extern here at this office !< /review>< pics>

This place is the worst you have a liar as a receptionist RUDE AT THAT !!! I got reffered here from my dentist in Modesto for a route canal on my 6 year old I have medical insurance for her. I got to the office it's very nice and clean but the service for me was terrible they told me itd take 2 weeks for medical to approve the procedure this was April 13 2017! It's now may 4th I'm getting the runaround and never a call back from the dentist (they said theyd call back with update) everytime!!! They never did I FINALLY CALL MEDICAL AND THEY TELL ME ALL THEY SENT OVER WAS THE BILL LIKE WHAT THE HECK SO THEYVE BEEN LYING TO ME SO I finally call the dentist she said she did and I asked her for the confirmation # and she said she'd call back of course she didn't and didn't call back the following day either so I call and ask why I haven't been called she said she's been busy working so I guess a courtesy  phone call takes hours I ask if she has my phone number she said yes and now she's saying she didn't send in the proper forms to medical so the waiting starts again 2 more weeks So UNREAL TO ME !!!! MY DAUGHTER IS IN PAIN KEEP IN MIND SO I ASK HER WHY CANT YOU CALL TO TELL ME THAT so she tells me I don't have your number when she just said she did I HOPE TO NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE TO CLOVIS K&H DENTAL ITS BEEN A NIGHTMARE AND THE PROCEDURE ISNT EVEN APPROVED YET DUE TO THEIR POOR WORK ETHIC !!!!!!!</review>

The place is a bit tiny but perfect to spend a nice dinner date at. They have two prices, the silver $25 and the gold (forgot the price) for all you can eat. The only issue we had was my sister found a hair in her rice. The staff was quick and apologized. The experience was wonderful,  if you ever find yourself in that area please visit!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I went the first time it was lovely
I went in the second time they didn't let us go in because we had a group of 7! Today I walked in with my kids group of (5) the server did not want to sit us! Because we were 5! Yet they had 2 parties of 8 or more???? Why? They had said in the beginning they only take parties of 6 or 5???</review>< pictures>

Came here on a Saturday night after seeing other KKBQs with 3 hour lines. No line, was suspicious. But after eating, I am more than satisfied by quality and service. Everything and anything you could want in a KBBQ. Good meat, good seating, good sides, good service. I loved it<//text>

<user_name>Monica Guevara<//user_name><time>1555871330744< /time><review>One of my favorite K BBQ spots. The staff is the friendliest you will meet and will make you feel like you’re having a big meal with family. The cuts were thicker than at a lot of other places and te marinades were flavorful, if a little on the sweet side. The bon chon was plentiful and honestly was only slightly more in price than some of the all you can eat spots. We got the medium combo for two but would have been fine with a small.</review>< rate>

<rate>2< /rate><review>After a few attempts at other Korean BBQ restaurants on a Saturday night at 8, Yang San Bak was the only one that didn't require a wait. I guess that couldn't have been a good sign.

Three hangry friends and I went with the Combo C (for 3-4 people). For $64.99, you get brisket, rib belly, marinated beef, steak, and a bottle of soju. Between this and all of the banchan dishes, we were stuffed. It was more than enough food. The flavor of the meats and the side dishes were good overall, but some of the cuts were a bit chewy.

Service was lacking. I'm not sure if it's a Yang San Bak thing, or an LA KBBQ thing, but in NYC KBBQ spots, they help you cut up the meats, grill them, switch out your grill plate, and refill your banchan dishes. None of that happened here. We were left to handle our own meats, like peasants. And sadly, our empty banchan dishes went unfilled (waiters were nowhere to be found). I looked over at the couple next to us, and their grill was completely burnt, so it wasn't just our table.

I think next time, I'll get a snack to hold me over and wait it out at the better KBBQ restaurants.</review>< Pictures>

First time trying a non buffet kbbq place and I really enjoyed it! I'm not sure if it was just me, but it felt like the meats were higher quality compared to buffet spots? Will definitely be back here again, I was already telling my sister (who LOVES kbbq) about this spot.< /text>

Other than that, the food and service were excellent. My server was very attentive and helpful.

I cannot really judge the service all too much as I was literally the only customer in the restaurant the entire time of my visit. Perhaps the lack of other customers is why the vibe was not quite right.

Knocked a star for the gristle. I have never experienced that in all my years eating Korean BBQ.</review><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Found this place randomly next to our hotel and it turned out to be one of the best Korean BBQ we've had! 1 order per person is more than enough since each other comes with many sides and condiments. Ate here like kings and spent around $50 for two so very reasonable !< /review>

Amazing Korean BBQ! Serving size is generous (small easily feeds two) and the variety of accompanying dishes is spot on. Servers are knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't fault!<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>The Place: It's located in a typical LA plaza with tiny parking and random stores and restaurants. However, what isn't typical, is the fact the place itself is fairly quiet. Club music isn't blaring at 96db. You can ACTUALLY talk to the person across the table in a normal voice. If you, or someone you know has a hearing aid and love KBBQ, please go to Yang San Bak.

The Food: High quality meats and delicious sides. So let's be honest, it doesn't have the best meat, but it does have great meat at a great price. It also has one of dipping sauces ever. Seriously, that red chili sauce is amazing.

The Price: This has one of the best quality to price ratios for a KBBQ place in Koreatown. And their combo/meal includes an alcoholic drink. So this makes the place even more reasonable if you drink but hate having to pay $12 for a bottle of soju.

What I Would Change: So this place isn't as hip or trendy as the other places in KTown. But this has become one of the best overall KBBQ places to go. It isn't as busy or packed as other KBBQ places in the area. It does make me worry if they're making enough business (given the rising rents). But then again, I like that we can go at 7PM and not have to wait until 8PM to finally be seated. So maybe I don't want anything to change about this place.< /Review>< Pictures>

Our favorite Korean BBQ in the area. Nothing fancy looking but the food is really delicious. Let's say it is a neighborhood type of restaurant. Prices are affordable, the place is clean and the crew really friendly. Packed during the weekends so try to call in advance<//review>

We checked into our hotel after 9:30 pm on a Friday night and were dying for some good Korean food.  This was one of the few places open late, with decent reviews and happened to be right across the street from our hotel. We ordered the combo A; it was plenty of food for two. Good quality, loved that it was open late.</text>

<review>We had 3 adults and a child. Ordered medium sized mixed bbq plate. ($75) also came with a drink (large beer to share or soju). I wasn’t sure it was going to be enough food since I eat a decent amount but it was.
Also ordered cold buckwheat noodles for additional $10 for large and $7 for a small.
All the food was amazing and the service was great too.
Definitely will be back if I’m the area.</review>< pictures>

Really good meat and banchan. It ends up being as cheap as an all you can eat place; but with better food, and you'll still end up stuffed. The rice grilled with meat-juice-soaked kimchi at the end of the meal is mind blowing.</Review>

The service is very Asian, speak up if you want anything or else you'll be ignored. We ordered a 2-3 person set, brisket, pork belly, rib fingers and bulgogi. It comes with an alcoholic drink, soju or beer. You also get a steamed egg a person and a variety of ban chans. It was a good thing I read a few reviews before going and ordered rice. You can get the rice and pour if into the moat of kimchee and make fried rice with it. The grill is a bit small so be prepared to wait a bit. Overall, I enjoyed it and will go back in the future. There wasn't a wait like some of the newer, more hip kbbq places.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b882b5222d0b:0x2ff023586660adb8< /gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) This is just Korea. The meat is grilled, but the quality of the meat is really good. Local LA ribs are much better!

Not the happiest place to be right now. Items are sparse and the variety is poor. But that's not the norm. Hopefully things will improve as restrictions are lifted.<//review>

The employees are good and always welcoming. The only reason I giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because it's a bit on the messy side. Which then makes it hard to walk through the aisles with a shopping cart. They do carry a variety of items and at good prices.< /review>

<text>Different Ross stores have different stuff they keep in stock.  Some Ross are great for for different stuff.  This Ross never had a good supply of men's clothing.  I've been to this location many times over the years but they just never have very many men's clothes even after they claim," a new truck is coming in.". Just go next door at Kohl's and check out their clearance section, you'll find much more for better prices.  Maybe they have a better selection of women's clothes, but I don't recommend this store for men and boys.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

< Review>
Clean and organized store. Many good deals. Nice staff. My problem is with one of the workers. I wanted to buy a pair of shoes that were missing a price tag. I asked the male worker that was ringing up my items if he can find out the price and he said that they're $30. I told him that I saw similar ones but a different color that cost $20. He didn't believe me and asked for proof. So, I went back to the shoe aisle and found the exact same shoes for $20. He still didn't really believe it, so he made sure the price tag was really for the shoes. When he checked on the computer, the price was like I told him. He then rang me up for that price. I thought that was very sneaky. And he could have sent someone else to look for the price if he wasn't gonna believe me anyways.<//Review>

< review>
Pretty good selection of clothes for the whole family. The shoes section is definitely lacking and always a mess each time I've gone. Good prices overall though. There's decent fitting rooms, which as a woman is important when you're shopping for clothes. Service is usually good (quick and friendly).</review>

This is the worse Ross ever. Selections are very poor compared to Ross in Other cities. I like to bross atound stores like this to grab something for the house or maybe grab a shirt or what not. Not at this location. Literally, everything was outdated by a lot of seasons or just stuff people don't want at all. Place is very unorganized and probably will never come here again. Please clean up your store since it is very filthy!< /review>

Came in with my mom and was greeted immediately. Place is a grade level above a thrift store. Lots of stuff to choose from. With the help of a worker and a frequent customer. I found a nice dress and a pair of shoes. New and In good condition and for a good price. The lines were long but I was surprised and pleased with the quickness of the cashiers, 3 running. I will be a return customer<//Review>

<review>It took over 20 plus minutes to check out. The line was in the clothes. I was told the only have 2 checkers to keep the prices low. But there were plenty of employees working. I understand it's a discount store. But pulling another employee to manage the line for a few minutes keeps the loss prevention down and saves everyone money.</review>< pics>

<review>I am here now at the Ross store and waiting for my granddaughter to use her giftcard for $70.  I am sitting  the chair and had my leg on the storage chest to rest and the female clerk a short Hispanic with her hair  in a ponytail rudely told me to get my feet off the furniture. I was greatly surprised by her rudeness and I will never shop again here< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My go to spot for clothes. Have to really look to find what your looking for. Clothes are priced cheap but not cheaply made clothes. Need more staff for cleaning up and putting things away. Staff not very friendly.<//Review>

<review>Ahh this is an oasis of products. You will almost have to walk out with something in your hand. They have everything from clothes, jewelry, watches, Kids, toys,  art and they even sell candles. I love this place, they have things from all over the world and do a great job stocking holiday season  with all the little things you need to decor your place. Guys, they have shoes, gym stuff, water bottles,  car stuff and perfume.not low quality but high end perfume.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I usually avoid going to Ross stores because the shelves and racks are so cram packed worth inventory which makes it almost impossible to find anything.  And don't get me started on the inventory all over the floors.  It always amazes me when customers are so pathetically lazy.
This store was AMAZINGLY clean,  bright,  open and organized.  It was truly a delight.</Review>

<review>For such long lines the line goes fast, which is important to me. Dressing rooms are nice and private, with doors Instead of curtains. Large selection of pet and home goods, not just clothes. I got an incredible spiced honey spread, two dresses, and a rug for less than I'd pay at Wal-Mart.< /review><user>108205775826143775094<//user></record></dataset><record>

This is a pretty nice Ross, have gotten luggage, bathroom decor and kitchen supplies here. And every once in a while I'll find the perfect dress for like 20 bucks.< /text>

<review>A little to messy for opening hours. Friendly security greeting every person walking in. The carts have a pole which keeps you from taking carts to car. That's a bit too much, especially for new moms with baby and a cart full of stuff bought.< /review>< Rate>

This store is pretty well kept. There's a fairly large selection in each department. However, they seem understaffed during crucial shopping periods - leaving line waits upwards of 20-30 minutes.</review>

<review>Took my mother today for her senior day shopping. Could the cashier possibly ask if the bag was too heavy with all the clothing?? Then adds 2 cal king sheetsets on top of that...  All in one bag. I was happy to have been there to help my 70 yr old mother with a rollator carry said bag. Please cashiers ask senior citizens if their bags are too heavy.</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Multiple times that I have been at this location have been really bad. If it's not the associates not willing to help; which last time I checked is your job, it's  being asked to leave right on the dot if I wasn't going to be purchasing anything and be rushed out. Whoever does the hiring here needs to highly reconsider hiring people with some sort of history of customer service because so far it seems that a lot of people here don't know what customer service is.<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>This store is a MESS ...IF I could give minus 10 stars I would .....I took my daughter in law shopping and after 2 hours of shopping and finally finding everything she needed we proceed to check out ..... She spent just about 300 dollars and had 2 carts full of items and after the rude cashier gave her her receipt my daughter told me we couldn't take the carts outside ...so I said okay and asked the cashier if any employees or security could help us carry some larger items to the car because im disabled and at this point in alot of pain?? She looked at me and smiled and said NO !! I said are you kidding me ?? Even Wal-Mart provides this service ??? She just laughed and said no we don't !! So I carried what I could to my car and drove my car on to the stores approach so we could Load the car as quickly as possible cause it was cold outside !!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE SHOP AT THIS STORE ! AND I WILL BE CALLING CORPORATE !! YOUR STORE WAS A MESS AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE !! BUYERS BEWARE IF YOUR BUYING ALOT THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THEN SEND YOU AWAY WITH NO HELP TO GET TO YOUR CAR DISABLED OR NOT!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80ea40f8c614304b:0x80e06b6953c94d5</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This ross store is pretty organized and prices are great. Some of the staff are very friendly. The location is great and the store is clean, especially for a ross store. I personally think this is a pretty good Ross store compared to a lot that I've been to.</Review>

<Text>I was just at Ross at about 1:15 today, July 31, 2018, and I received the worst customer service ever. The cashier, Sophia, at register 2 talked really rudely, and passed quite a few sarcastic remarks. She started dumping the merchandise in and out of bags and practically throwing them. Her attitude overall was just absolutely terrible.<//Text>< Pictures>

Like most Ross stores, kind of messy.
I like to check the shoes, sometimes you can find brand names at good price.</text>

Until Saturday, November 25, in Box 6 we made a purchase, They were quite a lot, the fact is that they did not give us a Bag of the products we bought, nobody noticed that 1 of many was missing, for the Next Day we went to ask And very rude they did not look anywhere, nor did they check the cameras, since I did not have the Receipt because they did not give it to me, they did not question me about anything, they just told me Not this and it was Everything. I'm going to file a Lawsuit at this Store. It's not fair that they make a plan with tricks.

Me parecia un Buen Lugar precios accesibles y el personal amable siempre. Asta el Sabado 25 de Noviembre, en la Caja 6 realizamos una compra, Eran bastantes cosas, el caso es que No nos dieron una Bolsa de los productos que compramos, nadie nos percatamos que faltaba 1 de tantas, para el Siguente Dia fuimos a preguntar y muy groseros no buscaron en ninguna parte, tampoco checaron las camaras, ya que Yo no contaba con el Recibo porque no me lo dieron, No me cuestionaron de nada solo me dijeron No esta y fue Todo. Voy a meter una Demanda a esta Tienda no es Justo que hagan plan con maña.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>
