Customer service was GREAT! Was greeted as I came in through the door and waited no longer than 5 minutes to get cut.
They take their time with cutting your hair and make sure you leave satisfied with your haircut! Best barbershop in Norwalk< /Text>

SoCal Barber needs to be your go-to barbershop in the Norwalk-Downey Community.  The owners opened their brand-new shop with a mission and passion to give the highest quality cuts to their customers.  I can attest that this shop will not disappoint, the customer service sets the highest standard of what competing barber shops should offer.  With more than seven seats and a talented barber to fill each one, you will never have to wait long and will leave looking your absolute freshest. With more than thirty combined years of barbershop experience, the owners strive to give the BEST cuts to their customers.

The shop is modern and welcoming; you immediately walk in to a row of brand new seats, husky toolboxes, and big screen TVs.  The magic is in the details as each barber apron adorns the SoCal logo.

SoCal Barber easily rates a 5 out of 5 for customer service, the owner has a motto that everyone should be treated as family; each customer is offered a bottle of water.

SoCal treats military and first responders very well

Bottom line or TLDR:  This is the best new barbershop in town.  I receive a high quality cut every single week, the price is competitive, the barbers are talented, and the customer service is on point.  Look no further, this is the one.

Overall score: 5 out of 5 : Perfect<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2d3383e8f9fc9:0xe46447760468dc77<//Gmap_id><user>112337997683580491619<//user><response>{'time': 1591630293066, 'text': "Mr Tony it's a pleasure serving you thank you so much for you're feedback we do hope to see you back and best wishes on you're new career."}<//response><Name>Tony Park< /Name></record></dataset><record>

I experienced a bad haircut I ask for a fade the barber said he could do it but it came out really bad lob sided one side higher then the other and he also cut into my beard when I asked him not to. From what I saw most of the barbers are very young they look like they belong in high school. The customer service could be better and they could use a broom or two</Review>

<Review>SUPER Particular about where I get a haircut. Everyone claims to be good but SoCal Barbers Delivers!!

Today is Veterans Day. Being a Vet,
I appreciate the Day and the love for veterans from businesses. That said, I don't expect to get anything free...but today I was surprised AND grateful.

I went in for a haircut and the owner (Edith) who is also my barber AND hands down THE BEST barber there (no offense to the other barbers) surprised me with a FREE haircut!!

Can't say how grateful I was and appreciative of the gesture...Thank You Edith!

If you've never been to SoCal Barbers put it on your list of TOP Barber Shops. There are over 5 barbers on staff and they ALL get down and handle their skills like PROS!!!

Thank You again Edith and husband for the great service and love for veterans!

The place is great if your buying anything else except their disposable vapes like puffs and hypes. Their vapes that they get shipped in dont work really... I've personally had 3 not work, luckily one of those times was infront of the guy not working so I got another and then that one didnt work but yeah maybe it's a call to quite vaping or stop buying them from this place. (Total money lost $30 on their malfunctioning vapes)</Text>

Loved the service. The young lady that helped me was so sweet and knowledgeable on the items I had questions about. They have a fair selection of CBD products to choose from as well. This store is very conveniently located as well!< /Text>

Guy who works there helped me out with my device and answered all my questions with so much detail. And also the girl who works there is very nice and helpful. Love the selection of vape juices they have. They have all the branded ones. well organized store. No mess at all which I usually see at other smoke shops. They have tons of pipes. And a huge selection of cigars. Love going there.
If you are looking for a really good smoke shop with friendly and helpful staff I highly highly recommend this store.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1500490064780, 'text': 'Thank you MsSmarty K for your feedback, much appreciated'}< /resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Always been very helpful and knowledgeable. Whenever I visit the same girl is behind the counter and I've bought everything I value in my vape collection from her. I usually spend several days looking at reviews of the products and videos of the usage on forums and when I ask her opinion on what I might want, she always points me in the direction of the products I already had in mind due to my research. It confirms that she's gonna know exactly what I need before I even put in the work. Great prices, Great service. I wouldn't go to any other vape store in the area.< /Review>< pics>

He mostly buys cig's and cigars, so there was nothing unusual. On his previous visit he purchased eight Zippo lighters worth $201.65 and we did question him of reason for large purchase and was told going away. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE, We serve everyone with same courtesy and respect. On the other hand going as per your say, if he really is mentally ill then he should have limited access to funds.His Bank and neighborhood stores should be informed if in case he tries to make large transactions. We still feel sorry if that is the actual case but we also believe all problems can be resolved, given that they were taken through proper channels."}< /Response>< UserId.>

I for sure have to say this is my favorite place when it comes to smoke shops. The staff are awesome and very cool. They are super helpful with the needs of each individual customer. and they have a pretty decent selection of vape and ecig stuff they are continually working to make the selection bigger and a wider range of user range too. When I say that I mean they have starter kits. then they have variable voltage mods then they have straight up mechanical mods so it works for anyone who has vape needs. the three monkeys ejuice flavor line is amazing. I highly recommend the dragons blood or the strawberry blueberry. or if you like higher end stuff go for the snow whites demise line. they are absolutely phenomenal.

not the biggest of stores, but definetly good quality and great prices! And always there to help you find what you need!

I go there at least once a week, I will not go anywhere else!<//review>

Well a person claiming to be the manager of the store was acting agressive towards some older ladies and even slapped one of them in her hand when he realized he was being recorded. Manager or not he threatened the person recording saying that something bad will happen to her for recording.

Nasty way to treat customers, even if they were complicated, they were ladies. All this was recorded and posted on a video on facebook.<//review>

Today I went to buy chicken and the 3 employees were eating and leaving. I'm not complaining about it.
I complain because they answer in a rude way. And they tell me, the 3 of us are on break, come back in half an hour hora

<Text>Visiting Dr Giacopuzzi and his office staff is honestly like seeing friends. Everyone treats me like family, whether it's been a couple weeks or a year between visits. As a child I was severely traumatized by an insensitive and careless dentist. I carried that trauma with me for most of my adult life. Dr G is truly the best dentist I've ever had. I appreciate every effort he makes to minimize pain and discomfort. He answers every question I have and is more than willing to make sure I understand what each procedure entails and why it needs to be done. I appreciate him and his wonderful assistants so much and wholeheartedly recommend him to all the big sissys out there!< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c4a82184f66eb7:0x985dcdeb9847c2c2< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I broke my temporary crown which was completely my fault.  I called the office and they got me in the very same day, actually only a few hours after it happened.  They were done for the day, I got there right as their last patient of the day was leaving.  Part of the broken temporary was lodged deep in my gum, it was pretty painful and I’m so grateful they took me in and I didn’t have to wait over the weekend to get in.  They made me a new temporary and stayed nearly an hour after closing to get it done.  They were very kind and understanding even though I kept them late.  I am grateful and highly recommend Dr Giaccopuzzi and his staff.  They are the best there is!<//Text><GmapID>0x80c4a82184f66eb7:0x985dcdeb9847c2c2< /GmapID><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Colleen Collins</user_name>< Pics>

Initial meeting with staff was very pleasant.The atmosphere is warm, friendly, and calming. Dr. Giacopuzzi was forthright,  friendly, and willing to answer questions. His explanation was thorough and reassuring.
Although the news was not what I had hoped, I feel comfortable with the staff, Dr. Giacopuzzi, and am glad he will be performing my procedure. Most people don't do well with dentistry,  and I am no exception. But this office lets you feel you are in good hands that understand fears.<//Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Giacopuzzi since 1987. He is quite competent and stays up with the latest dental treatments. I call him "painless Dr. G" . I moved off the mountain in 1990 to San Diego. I have been driving for dental appointments with he and his staff since 1990. I highly recommend his dental services, including his staff.<//Text>

<Text>I have been a patient for close to 30 years and have trusted Dr. Giacopuzzi's diagnoses and treatments. I recently flew from Idaho just to be seen by Dr. Giacopuzzi when my local dentist wanted to fill 3 teeth that didn't even need filling! I highly recommend Dr. Giacopuzzi!

My daughter has a pretty bad phobia of needles. Dr. G tried to hide the needle for anesthetic from my daughter and lost her trust and he was very terse with her for getting upset and not being able to stay calm or still when he tried to administer it. We also called late to cancel one appointment and were charged $120 for the missed appointment. We never returned.<//text>

I appreciate the personal care that I receive from the entire staff. If you don't have one of Dr. Giacopuzzi's flossing tools, you need one. It saved my teeth, made my cleanings so much better, and made flossing so much easier.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Giacopuzzi has been my dentist far longer than I can remember. He and his office assitants are extremely professional and very personable. Dr. is always gentle and knowledgeable. My children when very young, were never afraid to get their check ups done. Even when a procedure had to be done, there was never any worries. I highly recommend DR. GIACOPUZZI'S OFFICE!

Just recently DR. has started an implant for me, I wasn't sure what it would be like, but, no worry's, it's coming along just fine! I'm excited to see , and feel what it's going to be like! Thank you again Dr. Giacopuzzi for being my gentle and knowledgeable dentist!</text>

As always Dr. G and hygienist Shellie were excellent. Both answered all my questions, explained the procedure— if I was unfamiliar with it,  and shared the whys of preventive care. I would recommend them to everyone.</review>

Best customer service to the 2 gentleman working on 10/16/19 PM shift. I commend both of you on your knowledge and the willingness to go the extra mile for your customer. It was the best customer service and a real pleasure visiting your store today.  Major love and respect to Zumiez for having these type of professional employees representing your stores.<//Text>

Excellent skate shop. I came in just looking for some longboard hardware, and the manager there, Will, did a great job helping me get set up. John put my trucks on and I got some cool sunglasses, too. The atmosphere here is great and all the associates provide even better service. I’d recommend this skate shop to anyone.</Text>

<Text>School shopping so expensive. $200.00 for 5  t-shirts. Ridiculous. But my grandsons favorite store.  People that work there are amazing. They really have good employees.< /Text>< Time>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Shopping here is like going to McDonald's for a really good hamburger!!!! If you like having fun on skateboards then you should support the company's that support you and you community and that will actually sell you a good product at a decent price and that actually skate and know why you should buy whatever it is you need. This place doesn't contribute to our community in any way and the people that work here don't care about you or even use what they are selling you. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND SHOP AT 5 POINTS SKATE SHOP!!!!</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

They carry socks, backpacks, with brands like Vans, adidas, Nike, salty crew, and smaller brands. They even have a skating section in the back with any parts for a board you need on the fly.</Review>< username>

I feel so fortunate to have found Ashley and Paws and Relax! She is professional, reliable and detail-oriented and it’s obvious that she is passionate about what she does. I have an elderly Cavalier with health issues and I’m always concerned about leaving him, but Ashley completely put me at ease. I received frequent updates, pictures and even videos of my sweet boy and I can honestly say that, for once, I didn’t worry one bit the entire trip! It was very apparent that he was in great hands. Ashley will be the only one I call to care for Bentley from now on and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone who wants to go away knowing that their pet will be showered with love and attention and receive the absolute best care.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Ashley recently watched our two dogs while we were away for a weekend. She made us feel so at ease with the dogs in her care. Our dogs can be quite anxious and nervous when they have a change in routine but Ashley was able to keep them calm and relaxed. She sent us text and video updates daily about how they were doing and took time to give them extra love and snuggles when they needed it - especially before bedtime. I could tell that they both were feeling happy and playful, even though we were gone. Ashley is an animal lover and someone you can trust with your fur babies. We have already booked her to watch them again for our next few trips out of town!</review><user_id>114234650703104936890</user_id><gmapID>0x88c2e178589408f1:0x97d3cac1651761da</gmapID><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPEuJpDqBG2SGyryE57iAd3avUgb0TajlTBQhL6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN01bxaQaARb4r9u3XMTgpZEyhWw04ceA9uVz4Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record>

Ashley is amazing! She recently cared for my 6 month old kitten, Velma, while I was out of town for a few days. Velma is my very first pet, and this was my first time leaving her. Naturally I was pretty nervous. Velma is also a "quarantine kitten," which means she's around me 24/7 but hasn't been around very many other people. I was afraid she would be really scared and wouldn't warm up to anyone! But from my first contact with her, Ashley calmed my fears. She was super responsive throughout the set-up process and asked lots of questions about caring for Velma. She did an initial in-person consultation, and Velma warmed up to her within the first 15 minutes! While I was gone, she visited Velma once a day, sending me lots of cute pictures, videos, and updates on how she was doing. This provided so much peace of mind and always brightened my day. She kept Velma's food and water replenished and her litter corner super tidy. Velma is super playful and got lots of playtime in with Ashley, which she loved. I can't recommend Ashley enough, especially if you have a young kitten or puppy. Also follow her on Instagram for lots of cute animal videos and photos! (photo taken by Ashley)</Text>

<Review>Ashley did such a great job taking care of our dog Hendrick. This was his first time with a sitter and it was so nice to have her come to us. Ashley made sure to send us updates about him to ease our minds while we were away. She is very organized and takes the time to get to know your dog and his routine before hand. Our pup is a very odd, sensitive, and nervous guy and he felt so comfortable with her. Thank you Ashley!</Review>< pictures>

Paws & Relax is the best pet sitting company in town! Whenever I go on a trip, I am confident that my two babes will receive all the love and attention from Ashley. She’s attentive, reliable, and has an amazing way with every animal she interacts with. I love the daily pictures and updates to ease my heart while I am away. Thank you so much for creating an amazing business that truly understands the needs of a pet sitter and for easing all anxieties and concerns while we are away!< /Review>

< Review>
Ashley was amazing! We needed a last minute dog sitter when going on vacation due to overlapping schedules with another dog walker. Paws & Relax was incredibly responsive, getting back to me in just a few minutes. Her pricing was very reasonable for 2 large dogs to be walked and fed twice a day for several days. She was always prompt and sent pictures and videos at every visit to help keep us from missing our boys too much. She was amazing with them!! One of our dogs, Link, is a newly off track racing greyhound who is still very skittish around strangers, and he went right up to her at our consultation! It was his first time interacting with a stranger on a first meeting, we were thrilled. Ashley took the time to meet the boys and ask great questions, so we new they would be in great capable hands. We joke that Link was sad that we weren't his new "girlfriend" when we came home! I would Highly recommend Paws & Relax to ANYONE with a furry friend needing to be watched, walked, or taken care of.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>From the initial visit to meet our pets, Ashley was friendly and courteous. From that initial interview until it was time for us to leave town, we lost a beloved cat. It was devastating for us to leave under these circumstances but we had no choice and left our remaining cat at home. Ashley's daily visits, pictures and updates were just what we needed to feel at ease while we were away. She loves animals and it shows. We will most certainly use Paws & Relax again should the need arise!<//Review>< pics>

Is this a happy boy or what? I recently moved back to St. Pete and feel so fortunate to have found Ashley (Wesley agrees!). In a pleasantly odd way, it feels like she's part of the family rather than just a sitter. So when I'm off at work, I know my boy's in the very best of hands. Super cool, a pro with dogs, highly communicative and simply awesome. Give Paws & Relax a call, you'll be glad you did.</review>

Leaving all our babies can be difficult, but there is no one that I would trust more to take care of all my fur & water babies. We are the epitome of helicopter pet parents (yes, with pages of instructions 😂) & need/love daily updates while we’re away. We never have to be worried! They are so spoiled and loved in Ashley’s care.

We also just adopted chickens & Ashley was the first one I reached out to to make sure our trusted sitter could watch them! They already call her aunt Ashley 😻🐓.

Whether your babies are large or small, furry, fluffy, or scaly- they will be treated with so much love that they may (almost) not even miss you!</text><name>Chloe Bawmann<//name><UserId.>107804560993822076988< /UserId.><Response>{'time': 1608992973951, 'text': 'Chloe, you’re the bomb!

<rate>5< /rate><review>If you are ever looking for a caring and trustworthy person to take care of your fur babies I highly recommend Paws and Relax (Ashley). I hate boarding my dogs as Chester has always had pretty bad separation anxiety and they always seem a mess when I get them back. It’s a little nerve racking to have someone you don’t know stay in your home while your away. From the second we had our meet and greet I knew the boys were in great hands with Ashley. Chester and Fynn are typically shy and it takes them a bit to come around to someone new. From the first second she was here at the house she was their new best friend. All 3 of them vying for her attention. It was at that moment I knew I had nothing to worry about. (They tried to leave with her afterwards). They were well cared for and we were provided many updates and pics/videos of the pups throughout the weekend. I could see they were happy and relaxed with her. She also took great care of our home (even filling the pool up since the filter has a leak). If you are looking for someone to stay overnights, or just mid day breaks for your fur baby Paws and relax is the best.<//review>< pics>

We had such a great experience with Ashley and Paws & Relax!  She took good care of my 6 month old cat while we went away for a long weekend.  It was his first time apart from us, but we came back to a happy and healthy kitty thanks to Ashley's love and attention to him on her visits!  She plays with your cats, cleans up behind them, helps with food and water, and even makes great recommendations about toys and pet care for keeping your fur babies at their best!  I loved all the pictures and videos she sent me while visiting my kitten Dansby to help assure me that he was doing well and loving his time with her!  We will definitely be calling Ashley and her team back again before our next out-of-town trip.  I highly recommend her if you want a loving, reliable, and responsible pet sitter to check on your animals while you travel.  :-D</review>

<Text>Paws & Relax always takes excellent care of my hyper/anxious Australian Shepard, Quill. He's a loud barker and is not the easiest to care for, but Ashley and her caregivers always make him feel comfortable. Their knowledge and expertise was the first reason I chose them, then I was able to develop a relationship with them when they did their in-home meet-and-greet. I have never trusted anyone as much as I trust them. Thank you so much for your attention to detail, excellent communication, and thoroughness.</Text>< Pics>

Ashley is amazing and so so so sweet! She took stellar care of our kitty – she showered our girl with love, affection, and attention and made sure she had everything necessary to be comfortable and happy. You can tell Ashley is a complete animal lover right away just by her gentle, caring interactions with your pet. I felt completely at ease knowing Ashley was caring for our cat, and she was superb with communication while we were away. I got lots of pictures and videos from her showing our kitty having a great time, and I'm SO glad I found someone I can rely on to treat my fur baby as lovingly as their own. I won't hesitate for a second to contact Paws & Relax the next time we need a pet sitter :)</Review>

Ashley is literally the best puppy-momma I’ve ever seen. Her personality and temperament is the perfect energy and poise for loving animals. We met at Petsmart while I was buying dog food for my new puppy and we just connected instantly. Our puppy loved her! It was puppy love at first sight! We hired her to come and check on our little furry baby the first night that we had to be away on a business dinner ... and we were so happy with how amazing of a job she did. I would recommend her to anyone needing a reliable and trustworthy pup-sitter!</Review>

Ashley and her team at Paws & Relax have been absolutely magical. My dog Jade can be a handful at times, and they've always accommodated her needs. She is thrilled everytime they come and walk/run her. And I can tell a HUGE difference in her energy levels when I come home.
Teddy, my cat, has come to love the extra attention too.
Communication has always been smooth and easy, I love getting updates and photos when she visits, like the one attached. I never have to wonder what's going on.
Travelling for work isn't easy, and Paws & Relax has absolutely been a life saver in putting my mind at ease over those trips. Overall I don't think I could recommend the services her and her team provides any more highly.< /review>

We are so happy to have found Ashley and her business Paws and Relax. When a family health emergency came up, Ashley met with us quickly and our little Grace just fell in love with her. It gave us tremendous piece of mind to hire someone experienced with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an understanding of the needs of older dogs.

Grace and our family highly recommend Ashley to you and yours!< /review>

<Text>These are the pet sitters you want. They have very high attention to detail and a professional can do attitude. My cats were given all the love and care they needed while my family was on vacation. And that's a big statement since they're all elderly cats and each have specific feeding instructions.

I highly recommend Paws & Relax to anyone.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>When I say that my pet is my best friend and family, it is a sentiment that I firmly believe. Not only is Harrison my lovable companion, but he is my sweetest friend. I am always reluctant to rely on outside services, but Ashley was highly recommend by multiple sources. I was expected to be out of town, so I arranged for Paws & Relax to come and take care of Harrison for me. Not only was I in constant communication with Ashley, but she was professional, reliable and was willing to go above and beyond in caring for my buddy. I HIGHLY recommend Paws & Relax for the best care, from a true animal lover!  😺♥️🐾</Text>< date>

I highly recommend Paws & Relax! Ashley and her associates are great to work with and very understanding of the needs of my Australian Shepherd. My dog’s name is Quill and I have another small dog, a min pin chihuahua named Dewey. Ashley was very understanding and patient with my Australian Shepherd who is a little under trained. I love my dogs with all my heart and wouldn’t trust anyone else but Paws & Relax. Such a great business that I value.< /Text>

Ashley impressed me at every turn with her professionalism as well as her down to earth, warm and friendly personality.  From the start I could tell she would take care of our precious furry family member like she was her own.  The communication was amazing! Twice daily texts with little questions to understand our kitty better, descriptions of happy snuggle time together (see pic) and sweet little videos so we could be reminded how very cute Tiny is.  Our kitty tends to be a bit shy and scared around new people but from Ashley’s  first visit Tiny was excited to see her and spend time getting loved on.  Those purrs don’t lie!  We will be calling Paws & Relax the next time we go out of town and I highly recommend them for all of your animal sitting needs!< /text>

Every aspect of this service completely exceeded my expectations. I had young kittens that I was nervous leaving alone, and I’m already planning my next visit for them! I completely trust this company and feel so at peace knowing they are being well taken care of and safe. Highly recommend this service!!</review>

I could not be happier with the service Ashley and her team provide.  They are ALWAYS reliable and I see how positively my pets respond to them.  It is so apparent this company truly cares about every pet and family they work with.  They have always complied diligently with my instructions. Highly recommend!< /Text>

We are more than satisfied with the work, support, and dedication Ashley has given us. We have 2 cats, one of them diagnosed with colitis and Ashley has been patient and given them a lot of love as if they were hers. She is always quick to inform us of everything that happens with them. We also have schedules that change frequently and they are always able to accommodate us. We highly recommend Paws and Relax for their professionalism and dedication. They have met and exceeded our expectations.< /review>

<review>There is nothing better than knowing that your dogs are in good hands!  The highlight of our dog's days is when Ashley comes to see them.  She is great to them and makes sure that they get the exercise that they need!  Is flexible with times to walk them and has always accommodated us when we needed an extra walk, need them to be fed, etc.  Also, she always sends us pictures of how they're doing which is great to get during the day!  I highly recommend her to anyone!<//review>< Resp>

I have two lab pups, and we had something come up last minute and needed a sitter. Ashley could not have been more helpful with fitting us into her schedule! She answered all of my questions, drove out of her way to meet the dogs beforehand, and kept us updated while we were away. We will 100% be calling her next time we have to go out of town!!🐾🐶💛<//Text>

<Text>We met Ashley, owner of Paws &Relax, shortly after we relocated to downtown St Pete, Fl this past January 2019.  We had gotten her name from our new vet, and from another condo resident. Not only did we hit it off immediately (she had grown up much of her childhood in our hometown of Rochester, NY!), but our 10 yr old golden retriever was so excited to meet Ashley, and went right to her, tail wagging!  Over the past months we have occasionally needed a dog sitter for a day, or an evening, or for a weekend.  Ashley happily comes to our place and feeds the dog, spends quality time with her, and sends us a video or a photo of their time together walking in the park, stalking a squirrel, getting a tummy rub.  We trust her with our dog, and of course, her coming and going to our home.  We have enjoyed several more casual chats about everything from her special spring travel plans, to her recent engagement! It’s been great getting to know her, and our dog continues to be comfortable with Ashley’s visits! We highly recommend Paws & Relax!</Text><Response>{'time': 1562270528187, 'text': 'The team here at Paws & Relax is thrilled to hear such good feedback. Thank you, MJ!

Anytime we go out of town, we call Ashley at Paws and Relax to take care of our pup. He is very attached to us and can be tough to leave with strangers. Thankfully, he loves Ms. Ashley and all her employees. She’s been great when asked to do overnights for us. Paws and relax really gives us that peace of mind that our pup will be taken care of while we’re away from him. Highly recommended!< /Text>

Ashley is AMAZING!

I was called out of town for a family emergency and needed a dog walker for my two large dogs. She jumped right in and was so very accommodating. She came over and did a meet and greet to make sure they were familiar with her which I appreciated. They instantly loved Ashley and I could tell she has a heart ♥️ for animals. Ashley sent daily communications via text, pictures and video. It was so very comforting to know that my furry family was well taken care of (and spoiled) while I was away. I will definitely use & highly recommend Paws & Relax!

My first phone call with Ashley put me right at ease. I knew right away that she was the one who I wanted to take care of my animals. I have worked in the veterinary field for 20 years so I am not an easy sell! I could not have been more happy with how well she took care of them while we were gone. She followed all of my instructions and absolutely went above and beyond to communicate with me and take care of our home as well. She was extremely quick to respond to all of my texts and sent me the cutest photos! I would absolutely recommend Ashley, she is wonderful!!< /review>< Gmap_id>

Ashley is without a doubt the most professional, kind, and loving pet sitter we have ever had the pleasure of working with!  As any fellow pet owner knows, our little furry friends are very much part of the family, and we could not trust them to better hands than Ashley’s.  Before meeting Ashley, we would have to board our little Yorkshire Terriers at the local kennel, which always ended up being a stressful experience for them.  Since meeting Ashley, that is fortunately no longer the case!  Upon returning from our trip, it was clear that our Yorkies were in the best possible care with Ashley.  As evinced by her every interaction with our dogs, she loves all the pets she looks after like they were her very own.  We could not recommend Ashley more highly!! 11/10!<//Text>

<Review>I can't say enough positive things about Paws & Relax, LLC. I have known Ashley (the owner) for many, many years and know how much she cares about each and every one of her clients. She will often feature the pets she cares for on her social media sites along with a little story about them, which goes to show how much she takes pride in what she does and all of the clients she works with. I would recommend Paws & Relax, LLC to anyone and can assure you your pet will be treated like gold!</Review>< Pics>

Ashley took care of our cat while we were away for a wedding. She exceeded expectations by taking the time to connect with our cat. A nice bonus is that she sent pictures and videos petting our cat so that we could know he was not only doing fine, but that he was happy. I would recommend her for any pet sitting needs.</review>

I was referred to Ashley but a close business associate of mine. She came highly recommended and she was everything I heard she would be. She is dedicated to her animals and her clients. I needed her last minute to take care of my sick dog while I went to work. My dog needed careful handling after a serious surgery. Ashley was very sweet with her and reported to me during each visit with a cute picture of my pup and a status update. Ashley is very sweet herself and you automatically know your pets will just love her. She is now my new pet sitter. I can't imagine leaving my dog with anyone else! She's the best!!!< /Review>

We were in town for a wedding and needed someone to baby sit our dog. Contacted Ashley and heard back from her within 10 min. Explained our need and she immediately booked us. This was about a month before the engagement.

Ashley and I stayed in touch over the month swapping stories. I felt like I knew her before we even met.

Ashley arrived to take care of our pup and allayed any worries we might have. As she watched Moose the first night she texted me several pics and messages. The next day Kelli came to watch Moose. She did the same thing.

Theses guys love animals. They know how important it is to the client to feel completely confident about their care.

It was an outstanding experience for us and for Moose. Can’t thank you enough and have told all our St.Pete friends about you.< /review>

We had to find someone other than a family member to watch our fur babies while we went on a two week vacation. Ashley was highly recommend to me and I immediately called and arranged a visit. She took to our two chihuahuas right away and they were comfortable with her as well.
During our time away Ashley sent daily updates and included photos and videos of our girls. We could tell that they were happy and well cared for. Ashley definitely has that special connection that is necessary for someone who cares for pets.
We were able to enjoy our time away from home knowing that our babies were getting the same loving care that we give to them every day.<//review>

We love Ashley and Paws & Relax!  She takes excellent care of our pups while we are away.  She's on time, dependable, and really cares about our babies. She sends us a text message with pictures of what they did during the visits. Ashley gives us total peace of mind when we travel!  We highly recommend her!< /text>

<Text>I truly cant express in words how grateful my husband and I are to have found Ashley with Paws & Relax.  Our 2 siamese cats attached quickly to her and were treated like royalty while we were away.  I am someone who will put my pets needs before my own, and really do see them as family.  It was so important to me to find someone who not only provided care to my pers, but someone who really loves animals the same way I do.  I wouldn't recommend any other source for your pet sitting needs.  I have such peace of mind knowing that in the future we have a reliable and kind sitter for our fur babes! Thank you Ashley for being so good to our cats and for being our new friend!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

On a last minute trip , we were in a hurry to find a pet sitter! Ashley came highly recommended by well known Groomers in St.Pete! She was Amazing with our little pooch!  It's was very important for us to have photo updates and behavioral updates per day, while we were away! She definitely exceeded our expectations with keeping the lines of communication open, by texting photos and her feedback! I would highly recommend her. Very trustworthy, warm, friendly and professional. If my little diva likes her (she's a tough cookie) then I'm sure your experience will be great as well!< /Text>

House was clean and in-order when I returned. She is very trustworthy and I would recommend to all. She will even send you a photo of your animals. Thanks Paws & Relax!< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
TEN STARS!!!!! Ashley was phenomenal! When it came to my aging feline with renal failure she was a great help in administering and showing me how to give the IV fluids. She did everything with a gentle caring interest to get things right. I feel like she could tame a lion with the same alpha pack leader tactics. And her ability in reading the animal is really her greatest asset. I feel like she was in tune with what they were thinking. I was a little jealous because she and him hit it off so well right from the start. Did I mention she and her team are pet CPR and First Aid certified?

I have always been a person who does business by the saying; "You can have fast service, great service, and pay less. But you can only choose two.” Well, she really made me believe I could have all three! She was responsive, more than fair for what she provides, and gave an amazing experience behind each visit tailored to fit the pet's individual needs. There will always be people willing to offer less yet I always say you get what you pay for. And in this case you’re paying for the best. She is the ultimate pet insider. Her professional, personal service, and the peace of mind she offers through great communication are worth the investment.
Sincerely impressed,

Jonathan< /Review>

Had to go on a last minute trip and left my 7 month old puppy in Ashley’s care. She conducted an initial “meet & greet,” and sent us frequent updates and pictures (she even hand fed my stubborn eater). When we returned home, we could tell he was happy, had been played with and was given lots of love. We were beyond impressed and will be using Ashely going forward. Highly recommend.<//text>

Awesome, trustworthy care for pets, even in a pinch.  We had to leave town unexpectedly, and Ashley made it so much easier.  Being new to town, we didn't know anyone in the neighborhood to ask to watch our cats, and Ashley came to our home within a couple of hours after I reached out to her.  We received daily updates, and will definitely call her the next time we plan a trip!< /review>

It was so nice to have a "meet and greet" between Ashley and my kitty. They got along right away, and I was impressed too! Ashley was kind, caring, knowledgeable and very professional.

She sent updates with photos or videos each time that she visited my cat which completely set my mind at ease. She also took our cat for several visits to the vet to receive fluids.

I highly recommend Ashley and her pet sitting services. I recently went out of town for 10 days and she did an amazing job taking care of my cat. My cat typically hides under the bed from strangers but while I was gone I received videos or pictures every day of Bella playing with Ashley or sitting on the patio with Ashley. It was a great feeling knowing I didn't have to worry about Bella in lodging or worry if she was hiding from who was checking on her. Thank you again Ashley!</text>

Ashley is wonderful with pets.  Very attentive to their needs with much patience taking care of a young pup over labor day weekend.   Lotta TLC, for sure and somebody you can feel assured your pets needs are well taken care of when you're away on an extended weekend or perhaps for mid-day pet walks....I would highly recommend her services to those that want a responsible caregiver to our furry friends....< /review>

Ashley is very professional and very very compassionate.  She kept me updated on my pups and they were happy and calm with her my house.  I felt very comfortable with her coming and going at my home while we were gone.</Review>

< review>
Ashley is the very best.  We have had many sitters in the past with our dogs and they don't hold a candle to Ashley.

She is there on time, does what she tells you she will do and loves what she does.  My dog just loves her.

Who could ask for more.

Ashley is very professional and thorough during the Greet and Meet, and taking care of my German Shepherd.  She not only takes the extra time to meet his needs but also keeps us up-to-date each visit.  Not only does he look forward to see her, I never worry as Ashley does a great job!< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Consider yourself fortunate if you can get Ashley to take care of your pets! What can I say? My dogs love Ashley and I do too.  After trying several, and I mean several pet sitting companies in downtown St. Pete I finally found the right one for my pups.  My little pup girl is very stubborn and when she goes for walks she wants to “tell” me where we are going, it takes a special kind of person with tons of patience to walk her, and Ashley has proven to be the one.

Ashley is compassionate, sweet and she authentically cares and loves the dogs. As a dog mom, I’m happier when my dogs are happy and I know they are safe and well taken care of.  If you are looking for a great pet sitting company, give Paws and Relax a try, you’ll be glad you did.< /Text>< pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I was a brand new client when my other pet sitter fell through. Ashley was able to meet with us and start watching our 2 cats the very next day -- and over the busy Christmas season, no less! She came highly recommended by my vet, and it's easy to see why. She's very friendly, professional, flexible, and sent us photos of our critters every day. Her prices were much cheaper than others, too! I recommend her 100%</review></record>

<text>I decided to try Paws & Relax as I have heard so many wonderful reviews. Ashley did not let me down! She is such a caring and compassionate person I knew my little Douglas would be in good hands. I can tell they have built a great bond as Ashley is so incredibly good with animals. Would definitely recommend her services and will continue to be a loyal customer.<//text><date>1513193988368</date><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5</Rate><gmapID>0x88c2e178589408f1:0x97d3cac1651761da< /gmapID>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><text>We were recently in need of a pet sitter after our previous wonderful sitter moved out of the area.  We found Ashley in the nick of time -- she came to the rescue taking care of our spoiled cat and dog, and they both loved her the moment they met her! She spent a lot of time with them during each visit and cared for them as if they were her own pets.  Everything at home was in great condition when we got back. We loved the daily updates and pictures.  We highly recommend Ashley. Our experience has inspired confidence that the times we have to spend away from our pets, they will be cared for as if we never left.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I love Ashley! She is always fantastic with my dog, Duke. He’s a man killer for sure, at his majestic 11 lb body weight, but she showed no fear and bonded with my little guy right away. With his little bladder he has to go out a lot and not only does she keep up with him she also sends me great videos and pictures to lighten up my day. She is an amazing person and I would recommend her to care for anyone’s animals!< /Review>

Ashley, owner of Paws & Relax, is that person.  My pups love her and I feel comfortable leaving my cavaliers in her care. Ashley is reliable, dedicated to the pets left in her care and I highly recommend her services!< /text>< date>

<review>Ashley squeezed us into her Thanksgiving week schedule at the last minute, took her time getting to know both me and my cat Cricket during our initial consultation, won Cricket over in no time despite her serious aversion to strangers, and sent thoughtful texts, pictures, and videos while I was away to let me know that Cricket was doing well, which was especially nice since we had just moved to the area and were thus a little anxious to leave her for the first time. We'll definitely trust Paws & Relax for our future vacation cat care needs! Thanks again, Ashley! :)< /review><rating>5</rating><Date>1543002261557<//Date>< Response>

<Review>We love Ashley.  She is a very responsive and caring pet sitter.  When we have left our kitties in her care, she sends photos and texts with updates, and the kitties look very relaxed and chilled out.  She even sends photos of the clean litter box, so we know she is in top of things.  I think that one of our kitties really connected with her because when we come home, it's like, "Oh, are you back already?  Where's Ashley?  She pays attention to me."  The kitties don't seem to care that we have been away - stress free for them.  We rate Ashley 5 stars.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>We use Paws & Relax's dog walking service 4-5 days a week for our 1yr old French Bulldog. Ashley is very professional and accommodating to our busy schedules. She is wonderful and loving to our little buddy on her daily visits to our home. We are always updated with cute and funny pictures of our pup on his walk and she also lets us know what he did on the walk. I would definitely recommend Ashley @ Paws & Relax if you're looking for a professional, reliable and personal pet service!<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Mike Bedsaul</name>< Pics>

Ashley was super sweet and took good care of my pups. Feel comfortable working with her as she is friendly, cares about your fur babies and will stay in communication with you. My uppity Chi mix took right to Ashley! High praise! :)<//Review>

<review>Ashley does a wonderful job at dog-sitting! I have two Malteses (a 3 year old and a 10 year old) and she is great with both of them. My oldest dog is blind and has neurological issues and she is so patient with her and understanding. My pups love her and she is always sending me updates and photos while I am away. I highly recommend her!< /review>< gmap_id>

Ashley watched our 2 dogs over the New Years holiday and it was an excellent experience for us and our pets! She responded very quickly to my inquiry and I was excited to hear she was available kind of last minute (only a week or so notice). We are new to the neighborhood and she came highly recommenced from a neighbor. I will be recommending ashley to my friends and using her for future sitting! At the consultation I could tell she loves animals and would be good with ours, even though they can be a little wild when visitors come over! The best part is she sent photos every time she visited them and gave us an update. Definitely helped put us at ease while we were on vacation that our pets and house were ok!< /review>

My old pet sitter cancelled on me and I had to book Ashley last minute to my watch my 2 kitties and she was a joy to work with. She was very attentive to our needs and (more importantly) our cat's needs. She took excellent care of my fur babies and we will continue to use her services.< /review>

I absolutely love that when I leave my cats with Ashley, I feel like they are loved, if not the same then more by her.  She has extreme attention to detail with her paperwork and thoroughness prior to taking on any responsibility.  My cats were left in completely capable hands.  She sent me pictures and videos of them while I was away, which my family loved recieving.</Review>

Paws and Relax is a life saver! I have two large dogs and was desperately in need of some help with walks when my husband and I are at work. We were hesitant to trust someone we didn’t know in our home and with our pets, but hiring Ashley was the best choice we ever made. Our dogs absolutely adore her. They get so excited for her visits. She sends us videos and picture updates! I would recommend this company to anyone. Dependable, trustworthy and most importantly so loving with my babies!</Review>

Ashley came highly recommended and chose her after a meet and greet. I had to go to Rhode Island to inter my mother and sisters ashes last week. I was due home on Tuesday, however due to a major snowstorm unable to get home until Sunday. I came home to well taken care of boys. She keeps in touch with you about your babies and sent me pictures. In this trying time it was a blessing to know how much she cared. Client for life.<//review>

This last 7 day trip, leaving my 15 year old indoor cat in Ashley’s care, it became apparent she wasn’t coming daily. See below as to why I was suspicious and had my daughter stop by on day 3 of my trip. I had texted Ashley earlier that day and she replied that all was well. Two hours later, my daughter found the cat upset, all food gone (dry) and no cans of wet food had been used to prevent a recurrence of pancreatitis. The 2 litter boxes were full, and did not appear to have been scooped. All newspapers and mail still outside and the check for Ashley was still on the kitchen table. My daughter took care of my cat the remainder of the trip. Ashley claimed she had been in a hurry and had only stopped by to give dry food. She claimed she had emptied the litter boxes. I had left detailed, typed instructions about mail, wet food and newspapers as I always do. Ashley did return my keys but declined to meet with me, which I was fine with. Please read below about earlier incident.
Ashley seemed very professional and reliable the first 6 months she watched my 15 year old inside cat. Last New Years she texted me the day I returned from a 6 day trip, that she misunderstood and didn’t check the cat until the last day of my trip. She met me in person and we discussed why. She had an ill family member. I was impressed with her honesty and the next trip seemed fine. Early June, I returned from a 4 day trip to a stressed cat. The newspapers were yellow from remaining outside and it seemed like a whole can of food had been given that day, not a third of a can as the typed instructions indicated. I wasn’t sure what, if anything was wrong. Florida humidity can yellow the papers quickly and I hadn’t counted how many cans of cat food were in the case when I left. My last trip I did count and none were used.
I have never left a review before, but I can only say beware and have other means to verify your pets’ care.</text>

<Review>The name "Paws & Relax" couldn't be more appropriate. It is EXACTLY how anyone with a pet would want to feel when the excitement of that quick getaway coming to fruition hits or that family vacation is right around the corner....but you know that you can't take your four-legged friend(s). Sure, you can drop your pet off at a kennel or the most posh boarding facility that will pamper your pet to the max. Whichever end of the spectrum you choose, it doesn't replace the friendly, uninterrupted confines of what your pet knows... loves....and feels safe in....your home. You won't hear Ashley and the team brag about themselves so this is our chance to do that for them. Paws & Relax is everything that their name says it is and more. From initial consultation, to the actual site visits, to the follow-ups afterwards, Ashley and her team are second to none. The consultation not only provides you with an opportunity to "interview" Ashley and her team but, perhaps more importantly, it affords your pet(s) the opportunity to meet Ashley and her team, to interact with Ashley, and to gain a sense of familiarity with her. Your hesitations are immediately put at ease when you realize just how much Ashley cares for your pet and the extensive animal behavioral education that she has. Paws & Relax does their research. They are committed to excellence. You're encouraged to share a bio of your pet(s) that can include anything from simple commands that your pet is accustomed to hearing, to favorite toys, to quirky tendencies that they might exhibit in different situations. Beginning with that initial consultation and through the actual site visits until you arrive home, Ashley and Paws & Relax are prompt, treat your home as theirs with the utmost respect, and genuinely care for the safety and well-being of your pet. They want your pet to be as happy as they can be. Don't be surprised to receive a text or two showing your four-legged friend smiling for the camera either while your away! Paws & Relax makes you feel as if you are right there. The team will follow-up with you after you've arrived home to make sure that everything is okay and to confirm your arrival. Should you be delayed, they're more than willing to offer additional support. And their prices? You remember that kennel reference? Paws & Relax beat that and then some. Ashley and her team are game-changers for family - knowing that someone is going to be there to make sure that our "girls" are in good hands while we're gone absolutely helps us to take a deep breath, pause & relax. We have leveraged their services multiple times and look forward to continuing to do so for many years to come. If you're thinking about interviewing others, let me help you... look no further. Paws & Relax is the only one you need to call.< /Review>< pictures>

Ashley with Paws and Relax came recommended from another pet sitter who doesn't venture to St. Pete and I am so happy. My two rescued fur babies, Harmony and Madison seemed so upset prior to hiring Ashley. She pays them a daily visit and takes them for a walk or on rare occasions feeds them. I felt like an awful pet parent having to leave them both too long everyday since I work on the other side of Tampa and am stuck in traffic daily. I couldn't recommend Paws and Relax services more. You won't be disappointed.</text>

Ashley has been walking my dog Love Monster for several months.  Monster is a rescue and has separation anxiety when we are apart.  This past weekend Ashley stayed took care of Monster while I was out of town for two nights.   She came over early and meet with me to go over everything in the house, then she walked Monster so I could talk my luggage outside without him seeing it and getting all anxious.   Then she came back a couple hours later and spent the night and slept in the bed with him like I always do.  The next do she got up with him, feed him breakfast, played with him and walked him and mostly she gave him a lot of love, tenderness and calm affection and he really didn't develop any anxiety.   She came back and walked him at lunchtime and then spent the night again and repeated everything from Friday night.  She also texted, sent pics and videos and we talked on the phone.  When I got home Sunday afternoon my little doggy took forever to come to the door because he was so relaxed and sleeping so soundly!   Normally he's all frantic when I come home but he just snuggled up and gave me kisses!  The house was clean, the sheets were in the wash, the newspaper and mail had been brought in.  It was a fantastic experience that allowed me to leave my little doggy overnight for the first time in over two years.  I will continue using Ashley and Paws & Relax to walk Monster during the week and take care of him when I travel.   I highly recommend Ashley and her team!  XoX<//Text>

I have nothing but amazing things to say about our experience. Ashley is professional and wonderful to work with, and she’s fantastic with dogs. Our dog LOVED her and you could tell she loved him too. She came over for a pre visit to get to know us first, and she shared regular updates while Petsitting. Having peace of mind when you have to go out of town for who is with our pup is priceless. Thank you, Paws & Relax!<//Review>

We have always been pretty nervous to leave our 2 dogs with anyone besides family...until we met Ashley! After our in-home consultation, we couldn’t have felt more comfortable leaving town knowing our crazy pups were in good hands! Ashley spent the weekend watching our dogs while we were out of town and we got pictures and updates everyday keeping us posted on what they were up to. Our dogs are sweet, but they’re also a handful..but they loved Ashley the second she walked through the door and she was instantly on their level giving them lots of love! She is insured, professional, and asks all the right questions to make sure your animals feel comfortable during her stay. She followed all of our detailed instructions and left our house spotless. Even when we asked her to come by to check on our dogs on a last minute notice, she helped us out without a second thought. I would strongly reccommend Ashley and her team to anyone that is looking for a trustworthy and loving pet sitter (if you follow her on Instagram, her love for all the animals she cares for is blatantly clear). Thank you for all you do for us Ashley! Our pups can’t wait for the next time they get to hang out with you :)< /review>

<Review>After trying out a local pet boarding center for my two yorkies several times and feeling very dissatisfied with the experience, my husband and I decided that it was best to have our yorkies and chinchilla stay in the comfort of their own home while we went away for a week. We reached out to Ashley to see if she could watch them while we were out of town. She was phenomenal! Our yorkies and chinchilla bonded with her and were exceptionally happy. Ashley kept us updated on a daily basis with videos and photos of our fur babies which comforted us knowing that they were being well taken care of and that we made the right decision. What sets Ashley apart from anyone else? She's extremely knowledgeable. Don't just choose anyone to watch your pets. She's extremely thorough with pet care do's and don'ts.  Ashley is detail oriented and extremely observant. I love how she is also pet CPR certified. My husband and I have had some close calls with heat stroke and poisoning with our pups over the past few years. You cannot cut corners with your fur children. We chose Ashley because she knows how to prevent emergency scares while giving your pets the best care they deserve. We felt so comfortable knowing that our fur babies were over the moon happy during our absence. We will only use Paws & Relax's services for all our future trips. I highly recommend contacting Ashley for ALL of your pet care services.< /Review><GmapID>0x88c2e178589408f1:0x97d3cac1651761da< /GmapID></record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Ashley was great with my boy. Roman is a pitbull and a very vocal dog. He can sometimes scare people when they first meet him because of his bark for attention. When Ashley came to our home for our Free Initial Consultation, she showed no sign of nervousness or fright and just got eye level with him to make him feel comfortable and they quickly became friends as he started to give her non-stop kisses. Whenever I go out of town for a day or a full weekend, Ashley always takes great care of Roman and is sure to send awesome pics while i'm away to ease my mind. I highly recommend her for your pet-sitting needs, she is wonderful and really cares about the pets.<//Review>< Pictures>

Ashley is great!  I have two dogs - one of whom is a standoffish shar pei that growls and barks at most people.  She was so patient with him - he was eventually giving her kisses and going on walks with her which is a major feat!  It put me at ease to leave my pups with her.  I will definitely use Paws & Relax whenever I go out of town.  Highly recommend!!</Text>

<Review>Ashley has taken care of both of my dogs before when I’ve been out of town. I have a pitbull and American bully and she didn’t hesitate at all to come by and help. She’s absolutely great with the dogs as they loved her as well. It’s hard to find someone to trust nowadays not only with your pets but also the fact that they have full access to your home. I’ve recommended her to tons of my friends and every time I see someone on Facebook in need I’m sure to tag her right away and leave a comment as well. She would even send me daily photos of her playing with the dogs and even FaceTime me. Doesn’t get better then that!! Hands down, the best around and she still holds a key to my house!</Review>< pics>

Love this place. Been going here for a couple years. Great climbing runs and friendly staff. The only downfall is the gear shop needs a little more product. But overall, awesome.< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><rate>1< /rate><Text>So, it very unfortunate that this business has very poor customer service. Do not buy anything at this gym! Just wanted to exchange a pair of shoes and they lost a membership on top of it.

I did not verbally attack your employee. Attack is a form of threats. I did not threaten anyone.  Yes, I was completely upset, you better believe I raised my voice. Plus, it was so loud in there, who could hear, I had a hard time hearing.   Again, your business is dancing around the main issue.  No one would inspect the shoes, they were not worn.  Your employee, Alishia, did not explain a return policy, it was only her adamant attitude that she believed they were worn, therefore no refund would be given. Complete pride and refusal to assist in the matter is what this was.  So, it appears that you do not have a return policy.  If there was, we were well in the guidelines of it.  On Sunday, we were told that it was 2 weeks with out use, we were at 5 days without use! But, I guess this is where your right to help comes in.  It was a predetermined decision that was unwavering!
Your head manager, who helped my son with the initial purchase, also failed to help my son when he went immediately back to him, once he could not get the second shoe on. A time span of approximately 5 minutes!  It was apparent that manager didn't want to be bothered with the issue.   Why, because he was a 13 yr old boy, who didn't ask for help and did not know what to do at that point and that manager took advantage of a youth.  All to say, when there is no lack of understanding, or care, this is the customer service one receives.  Again is very easy to be kind and compassion when it is not you who spent $150! Also, questioning my son's integrity, he is a truthful young man and very kind. This was also a case of your word against our word.  It appears that you will just believe what the employee says.  Your employee chose to help me when your business was busy, she knew why I was there.  The day prior, we were told there was no reason we could not return the shoes and they appeared to be unworn, and that employee was surprised that shoe was sold to my son because he saw how big his foot was.  And for your knowledge, I told Alishia to cancel my membership, I would not support a business who shows no care for their customers or members!<//Text><user_name>W D</user_name>< GmapID>

<Text>I came mostly to boulder but I wound up using a lot of the gym equipment as well.

As far as bouldering goes, there's a pretty small area for it. However, I will say their problems (routes) are fairly difficult. It was much closer to international standards in terms of ratings.

They definitely have their share of top rope, which looked equally difficult, and gym equipment. They have most of what a traditional gym has. There is also more equipment to use in that area. I took advantage of most of their offers and was not disappointed

They do not have air conditioning so it can get fairly hot for those not used to it. but aside from that the facility has good maintenance, is clean, and has a great staff.

TLDR: good climbing gym, lots of weights and other gym equipment. Clean well maintained facility. Stay hydrated.<//Text>< pics>

Very clean very fun place to go rock climbing they have auto belay, top rope and bouldering the bouldering area is a little small but different because you can actually top out. (Climb on top of wall).  The auto belays are very sturdy feeling so it makes you feel confident it will catch you.<//Review>

This is not for beginners just so you know. We came as a family 2 weeks ago and the service was subpar. It's quite pricey if you just want to try it out. Also, floors are dirty so germaphobes this ain't for you</review>

Although the gym is decent and there's a great community of climbers the owner of the gym is nothing but money hungry. I had a membership for 2 years. During the first year of my membership they were running  a promotion that any money spent at the shop would give you 10 % cash back when you renewed your year membership. Well the year came and went and when I asked about the promotion I was told that they don't do that anymore. I was never given noticed about the discontinuation of the promotion and never received cashed back from the shop.

Another issue with the money grab is I right before I canceled my membership the prices were increased for new customers. I was given a noticed by email that the prices were going to be raised but if you were an old member you were grandfathered in, expect despite being a member for almost two years my membership was still increased.

And finally the state of the gym is a joke. If it wasn't for the fact that they had some decent (and only some decent) setters then it would be a complete joke. I can't count how many times I have come across a spinning hold (and I'm a small person, only 107lbs) or how many times the water fountain has broken and not been fixed. The owner invested in a pathetic Ninja Warrior Course (that guess what you have to pay extra on your membership to use) instead of adding showers to the gym like he said he would.  The owner just obviously has no idea how to run gym. And if that wasn't enough he went and bought another gym to ruin (The Wall Climbing Gym). If I were you I'd just boulder at Vital Gym and make a drop occasionally at Mesa or Sender One. Don't go Rock Fitness, just run from it and don't look back.<//Review>

Checked out the place yesterday. It'd be a cool gym under normal circumstances, but their COVID protocols are suspect. The place is supposed to be an "open air" facility but the side bay doors were closed. Climbers, basketball players and folks using the weight room weren't wearing masks.

I understand that the current COVID policies allow for some flexibility, but in mind there is absolutely no reason to have maskless climbers and weightlifters - even if you are actually "open air". The risk is too high. Personally, visitors should at all times be wearing masks given that they are breathing all over the holds, walls, etc. I also thought the management could have done a better job spreading more hand sanitizer around the facility, and I didn't see staff wiping down equipment or members for that matter.

For what it's worth, I've been to other climbing gyms during this pandemic that have much better COVID policies, including all visitors having to wear mask and having to clean up after themselves. I have a buddy that manages a climbing gym up in Seattle and it doesn't take that much extra work to require and enforce a solid mask and cleanliness policy.

Oh... might also be worth mentioning that I'm not writing this out of jest. I spent a bunch of time observing everything in hopes of convincing myself that this place would be COVID safe since it's so close to my new home. Sadly not so.</text>

This place has numerous problems and fails to address most of them.
I signed up under a a year long contract and after the year, they just kept charging me. Told me it went month to month after a year. No one ever told me that on signup. I told them to cancel my account. They have this "system" where they cant cancel your account. You have to go on their website to cancel, which just creates unnecessary steps as the consumer. It is designed so you dont cancel while they hold all your bank account info. I mean come on, why else wouldn't an employee of said business be able to cancel an account? They can create them though of course. Absolute money grab.

The owner is rude and impersonal. I was a member there for over a year and the owner would play games on who he likes and doesnt like. If you aren't in the "in" crowd there, expect to be looked down upon by certain staff.

That being said, the facility is dirty and insanely hot. Why climb outside in beautiful socal when you can climb indoors here at 90-100 degrees. They have no ac. The place is a sweatbox. It creates situations that are entirely unsafe for anyone trying to exert themselves to the fullest.
The bathrooms are always broken, and things take forever to actually be fixed. No showers.

The money being spent is spent in all the wrong  places. Really they are being spent for the owner's selfish reasons. The gym desperately needed new gym holds or ac or showers or to fix all the broken stuff around but he instead decided to spend that money on an extremely overpriced "ninja warrior" course that you could build ina few days in your backyard. Not only that, but members paying 55 bucks a month couldnt use it because it was an extra "premium" item. How ridiculous, spend member money to buy things that you will keep members from using. Get real.

If you do end up going to rock fitness and start making friends, and then they suddenly disappear, they probably made the switch to the other climbing gym in the area. For good reason.

The owner here does not care about its members. Nor its staff. People are expendable here. There is no love, kindness or personal touches to this place. Toxic. Stay away.< /Review>

<review>Great Gym! I have been really intrigued by rock climbing and finally decided to give it a try. I came in on a random day just to see the prices & membership options, see if it would be worth it. The staff member informed me of a promo they had going on and I got a great price and signed up same day. I find myself spending a lot more time here than I did at a regular gym before. The staff members I met have been friendly & awesome people!</review>< Pictures>

<text>8/1:  Unprofessional Children operating this business. Here is what they do. You cancel service and without authorization, they take the remaining balance (10 months) from your account.

Save yourself grief from this very shady business. Who knows what they do with your bank information! Let’s see what this child Alicia Perez does next. Remember when you enter this facility check for inoperable equipment, dust, damaged floors, lack of cool air and lack of cleanness.

7/31:  This is the absolute worse establishment in the community. Old antiquated equipment, Thick layer of dust throughout the box, no air, just a of couple of cheap fans that don’t oscillate.

100 degrees inside that box. If you have children look up at the rafters and you can see the layers of dust.

So when you explain to her that this is a Heath issue all the stupid lady would say is you signed a contract!  True less than 30-days ago!

Her other response to me...it was hot in June when you signed up! So you knew what it’s like. Although it was in the 80’s that day not over 100. So after all of my concerns I asked her “is the gym environment safe? all Alicia Perez would keep saying is “you knew the terms of the contract”

Now it’s not about a lousy $100, it’s the principle of the matter. This group can careless about any customer just the revenue.

As a consumer I’m far from done; there are many legal avenues to explore with this injustice.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

After COVID 19 these guys took out the carpet, put in brand new matts and cleaned every climbing point

The guys go up after every climb and clean again.  The state told them to use chemicals that would destroy the integrity of the harnesses so we had to use our own  but these guys are great< /text>

<review>This gym is really falling apart. Recently canceled my membership for several reasons. Main reason is the heat- there is no insulation or any air conditioning/swamp cooling so it is dangerously hot! Seriously, we climbed for 5 minutes during the day and were so drenched in sweat we had to leave. It is not safe to have conditions like these- I left a suggestion on their "suggestion board" about this problem and instead of addressing it they just tore my suggestion down.

Second, the facilities are run down. Cage ball has been broken for over a year- upstairs area with ping pong and pool table is torn up and dirty. Rock wall and mats are in poor condition and dirty. I witnessed an employee use the same mop used in the bathroom on the slack line mat- gross. Weight room area is a disaster- cables for machines are fraying and some cables have sharp edges on the attachment piece, one of which pierced my shirt once. Limited free weight selection and area is just dirty.

Lastly, while there are some good employees here, most just socialize when they are supposed to be working. Never ask how customers are doing and "safety" orientation for new climbers is basic. The owner of this place is rude- hardly ever around, never greets customers, only interacts with his climbing buddies that go here. He Invested in a ninja warrior course that is NEVER used instead of working on the A/C problem. Will be taking my business to Vital!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>So, this climbing gym seemed nice at first BUT my boyfriend and I have been members for about a year and the owner never greeted us once with a warm welcome or smile. He never even looked our way, it seemed like all he cared about was hanging out with his friends and showing off. So, after awhile we noticed he didn't seem to care about his (new) customers or the safety of the gym. A lot of things are old and keep falling apart. Instead of investing into his actual gym, he invested in a ninja warrior course, which so far is seems no one uses, but the owner, again, for him to hangout and show off to his friends. Being in the inland empire it gets so hot in the summer and the fans barely work, I do not wish to risk my life to heatstroke as I'd rather climb outdoor, because even in the outdoors it's cooler than this rock gym, since there is outside wind and shade, because inside the gym the hot air just keeps being recirculated, etc. There is no insulation in the gym, as it seems like a warehouse, so it is very dangerous.<//Review>< Pics>

It looks like you guys were having a good time and climbed while clipped in to the auto belays multiple times. There is a lot of types of climbing and you may have seen such as lead climbing nearby where the rope starts below you. Your Valentines date may have attempted to do a similar type of climbing, but this was incorrect and very dangerous. My staff correctly clipped her in to mitigate possible injuries. I believe Austin understood that she was climbing the high walls on purpose without clipping in, which was true, but it may have been just a misunderstanding on her part that he did not realize. I apologize that you guys were kicked out and that it ruined the night, and would like to talk to you more in person or on the phone about this to find a resolution.'}< /resp>< Review>
1st time in a Rock Climbing Gym and my LAST at this location.  I took my Valentine's Date to something we had never done together before (instead of dinner for a change).  She was really excited and Ms. Moreno (front desk) took us through the facility and went over procedures.  It was fun for a while.  For some reason, my Date forgot to clip the rope to the her climbing harness while climbing and as expected, one of the staff came up and put on the clip and told her she had to have it at all times for her security.  i completely get that it's a liability issue for the company so we made sure not to do it again.  About 10 minutes later another staff member explained this in detail when apparently he heard about the incident.  We climbed for another half hour only for Ms. Moreno to come to us and requested that we LEAVE the facility by orders of her Manager AUSTIN (through TEXT btw).  I was mind-blown!  Again, this was our FIRST time EVER climbing and we were following procedures after the incident.  This ruined the night of course.  NEVER going to this place again.  STAY AWAY if this is your first time rock climbing.   TERRIBLE experience.< /Review>

I love Rock Fitness Gym! I went there on the Grand Opening event and highly recommend it to you devoted rock climbers.  They have tons of hard routes that I enjoy and lots of  top-rope climbing!  There's a basketball court, lots of fitness equipment, kickboxing, and other fitness classes and much more!  When you walk in, the people are very nice and helpful and the air-conditioned air just feels good.  I will for sure climb at Rock Fitness Gym as my main gym and you should join me!<//text>

Came here with a friend to do some rock climbing. It was my first time here and I definitely had a good time. Miss at the front desk was very helpful and made sure we grasped the concept of how everything worked before letting us on our own. All in all very good time. Definitely will be back.</text>

< Review>
A pretty solid gym! Rock Fitness has great facilities and an excellent top rope and bouldering section. It's nice to have the option to switch from climbing to using the fitness equipment or basketball court throughout the day. There is a crate-stacking activity that climbers can try out and it seems challenging but really fun! Also, it's open 24 hours which is a plus for those who want to get some late-night exercise or climbing in. However, there is a safety concern. Since there is so much variety in terms of what you want to do at the gym and because it's a very family-friendly place, there are a lot of children (and adults) using equipment that they may not know how to operate. At that time, many children were running around and playing on fitness equipment that they should never be in contact with. During the daytime, there weren't enough employees supervising and walking around making sure that people were being safe. Overall though, Rock Fitness is a great facility with friendly employees and I will definitely be returning to the gym!< /Review>

<text>I go to a climbing gym 5-6 times a week in utah, and have now visited this gym twice while in town visiting family. Not a huge climbing gym, but prices are very reasonable for the amount of variety it offers. I had a good experience the first time last year so I decided to bring my rather large family with me the second time taking advantage of their $10 Friday night deal, which really is a steal.

I will preface my justification for the 3 star rating by saying I am sure my group was a nightmare for the staff and other climbers, because we had several young climbers. I have removed one star from my rating because there were no top roping routes that were for climbers at an introductory level with limited athletic ability. At the gym I am sitting at right now I can count 10 top roping routes that are easier than the easiest route they had at rock fitness. Granted the gym I am at is twice the size, but still. When I pointed this out to one of the staff, he directed me to a small bouldering wall, which could occupy someone for maybe 3 minutes, and of course the gym I am at now has a comparable wall about 8 times the size. I realize that wall space is precious, but I am just recommending one or two routes be placed that anyone who can climb a ladder can climb, just to help people build confidence. If you guys choose not to do this, I would recommend improving the communication when people call talking about bringing the un-initiated and young children.

I have deducted another star because several of my family members found the staff unfriendly. I did not feel the same way personally, but I might just have different expectations for climbing gym staff, spending more time at other gyms.

So at the end of the day, while I would for sure sign up myself for this gym if I lived nearby, I would not introduce anyone to climbing through this gym again.<//text><Rating>3</Rating>< Response>
{'time': 1515096357472, 'text': "Hey Marcus!\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say we completely agree with you! We want to make climbing as friendly and inviting as possible and its extremely concerning that you didn't feel the easier end of our routes were as inviting to the public and newer climbers. This is something we'll convey to our routesetting team, and make a considerable effort to change in the future.\n\nSecondly, while climbers tend to look differently towards climbing gym staff as a more relaxed environment it's no excuse to have a lack-luster attitude towards customer service. I'd like to formally apologize that your family thought our staff was was un-friendly, and I'll be directly speaking with them to help this issue. If you'd contact me privately I'd love to correct this mistake with your family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAustin S.\nGeneral Manager | Austin@rockfitnessgym.com"}</Response>

I went to Rock Fitness grand opening night, and had a blast. This gym is totally sweet!!!!!! The inside looks very cool, and they have a good atmosphere. They play cool music while you climb and hangout! The prices are good because you pay for a day pass instead of hourly. I really enjoy climbing there and look forward going back real sooon!!!</Review>

Love the rock climbing but poor management.  Tried to book my daughter's birthday party and none of the staff was trained to book it on the phone.  Was told to go to website to book it but when I tried the website is not booking and website says to call the gym to book.  Was then given manager's email to which I sent my party request information.  No call back after several weeks now.  It's as frustrating for me as it is for your reading this.  I would recommend spending your time booking a party elsewhere.< /Text>

Absolutely amazed. I personally am a slackliner, but came here due to a friends recommendation. I was happily greated by a young lady named Lilly at the front, who explained the pricing of the day use and the pricing of the gear rentals. Once I was set up  and ready to go, she gave me a great safety orientation and even cracked a few jokes. I have never used an Auto Beley before but it was very interesting to see how it had worked and felt to trust my life with a machine. I got the opportunity to stick around for a good hour and a half, slackline and even lift some weights. Will be coming back, I saw some cool people, I met another staff member but forgot his name. Thanks Rock Fitness</review>

One of the best climbing gyms I've ever been to.  Tons of climbing surface for every type of climbing/bouldering and routes for every skill level/ability.  Also have a lot of auto belays for the times I need to go alone.  Definitely recommend.< /text>

Rock Fitness Climbing Gym is fantastic!!! We are impressed with everything about. There is so many different activities to do. Slacklining is my favorite. Kids never want to leave. They climb for hours and like to hang out in the rec area. Thank you for constantly keeping our family entertained and fit.<//text>

I went to Rock Fitness at their grand opening a few weeks ago, and i would have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable, entertaining places i have been for either rock climbing or working out in the gym.

This gym is amazing. The staff is extremely friendly, knowledge, and invested in the concept of fun and climbing. I am from Las Vegas and came across this gym while visiting a friend here.  I was blown away by the routes and the smoothness of the flow.  The entire concept of the gym is unlike anything else out there.  Nick, who works there understands the beauty in creating routes, connections, and the community of climbing.  He took time to speak with me and share his stories and a little about himself.  He also pointed out the classic routes that he set.  Nick and his team take extreme pride in this place and that is noticeable in all aspects.

All the people I met in this gym were friendly, talkative and really enjoyed the sport. If I lived here, I would be climbing and training here daily.  Great place, great people, and well thought out routes that flow like the outdoors!

All 5 or 10 vouchers must be used by the same person, one who's not been there in the last 6 months. Nowhere on Groupon does it say the first part! In fact, it states vouchers can be given as gifts.  Hopefully you don't take a group of excited kids there, thinking you'll get to use the vouchers. Nope, $150+ for 10 kids when 1 uses the voucher. So disappointed. Shady business practice.
* An update: the Groupon T&C have been changed since my initial review, and now accurately describe what's stated above. Doesn't change our experience, but at least new Groupon buyers know all facts.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1498865327618, 'text': "I'm sorry you feel that way. This is a new groupon deal that we are just started offering. The fine print does say Limit 1 per person, but i agree, should be even more clear and will be updated. Yes, the groupon deals can be given as gifts, but 5 and 10 punch passes are like the month pass that is also just for 1 person. The 10- punch pass on Groupon is $55, and Groupon takes 50% of that, so it is a VERY good deal, in fact, we lose a lot of money on all the Groupon deals.\nBecause this was unclear and there was not a manager there to remedy the situation, please email me at rockfitnessgym@gmail.com and I can get you another complimentary 10-punch pass.\nThanks!"}</response><gmap_id>0x80dc8316f7ddea9f:0x5f83e289b8f31159<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Have a long-term membership at Rock Fitness, and I have gone a few dozen times since the grand-opening. This place looks great, has great staff, and even though there are more and more things still being added to the gym, it is well worth to visit!< /Review>

It is a good place but when I was asking about the different package for kids, they only offer me the more expensive one, and they Don't explain very well what it is included, yesterday after a week,one of the team member said to me that if my kids want use the climing shoes I need to do check in on Facebook or instagram...... really? I paid 150 for my two kids and he said that the equipment is not included, ......no good, later i checked that all the membership can have free equipment. Disappointing.<//Review>

{'time': 1497740125700, 'text': "Hello Sandra,\n\nWe apologize for the confusion with your membership options. I believe our team members were a bit confused, and they believed you were requesting information about additional youth programs in addition to the Recreation Program your kids are currently apart of!\n\nTypically for free gear rental ALL members are required to post a social media check in for rental equipment. We recently revised this to not require Recreation Team members to have to check in on social media, moving forward we'll make sure our team is clear on our membership options, and that our gear rental policies.\n\nI'll be reaching our directly to you Monday Afternoon, Thank you!\n\n- Austin S."}< /Response>

We called to see if our 5 year old cold rope climb. They said yes, then when we got there they said he wasn't old enough, and we would have to take $12 class to use the manual ropes. So $42 for our kids to climb for maybe an hour? They wouldn't help us on the price or anything and would rather us walk out and never come back. Horrible staff.</Text>

{'time': 1468801209060, 'text': "I'm sorry to hear about your view on the experience. Yes, a 5 year old can rope climb (6yrs+ for the auto-belays). But, someone does need to be belay certified for anyone climbing, especially kids safety. This takes a staff about 1 hour to do (at a loss to us because that cost us about $25, so $12 is not bad for a skill that would last you a lifetime.\nStaff is not supposed to  give random discounts as we need to be fair to everyone. We have almost all 5 star reviews and always have compliments about the staff. Belay lesson is free with a membership and that is the most cost effective way for an individual or a family. We are also with lowest cost rock climbing gym in the united states for what we offer, and the only one who's pass is good for 24 hours."}<//Response>

I love this family owned and operated Mexican restaurant. The food is delicious. The service is excellent. The kindness and even-keeled temperament of all the staff is such a wonderful treat. The chorizo breakfast burrito is my favorite. Make sure you ask them to add sliced avocado. It's the perfect compliment to the burrito. The large burrito is huge...feeds two!!</Text>

This place is sooo good!!! Their specials are awesome, and at a great price! My favorite is the chili verde burrito with fries. Special is about $8. Cant beat that! And the woman working the front is so nice.< /Text>

Delicious authentic Mexican food at affordable prices in a family-run established Highland location. I'm addicted to the 5-taquito combo special, which includes your choice of 5 chicken or beef taquitos, covered with a generous amount of guacamole sauce, beans, rice, and a drink for just $7 and change!   The chicken enchiladas are among the best. Yum!<//text>

<Text>Do I remember Alberto's being a great place to eat at unfortunately they messed up our order so bad that I had to turn around drive 30 minutes back down the road just to get it right and then got nagged by the cashier aboutbecause I took a couple of bites out of the wrong thing that they sold me and then what they made for me back was cold so I'm going to give this one star not recommending it</Text>< pics>

I have been coming here for a few years now, and they never disappoint. I have recently given up red meat, and was vary happy to see fish and potato tacos. Both are great. There are several menu items that are vegetarian friendly.<//Text>

I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga, and my wife ordered a breakfast burrito. While my wife absolutely loved her food, I was disappointed. The chimichanga had only about 10% meat, and the rest was salad and beans. Perhaps they were low on shredded beef. I'll go back, but only because my wife really enjoyed her meal.< /text>

Old tortilla chips in my chilaquiles. They smelled nasty and got my and my brother sick. They made our trip to Big Bear unenjoyable... be careful about this details. I really wanted to go back for a refund  and tell a couple of things. If you have no fresh tortilla be straight forward and don't sell something low quality just to get the money out our pockets. I appreciate honesty  and the feeling you actually care about customer.  I would but something else for sure. Not cool guys :(</Text>

I used to come here when I lived in the area, and I enjoyed their food. Last night we were in the area and stopped in for some food, and its not the same as I remembered. The meat was dry and lacked flavor, as well as the hot sauce.</review>

This place is very authentic & a good clue is how many patrons speak Spanish. My favorite is their chile verde, particularly in a burrito with rice & beans, which I can barely finish. Great food from a small place, which even has a few tables inside.</text>

Decent but the Asada is way overpriced.

Seems like everything else is not too expensive.

I'd stop again but not for asada. I'd do fish tacos or carnitas.< /Text>

<rating>2</rating><Text>The place is small and clean. The people are nice. I had the Chile Relleno and Shredded beef enchilada. The Relleno was tasty, but the enchilada was not so good. The shredded beef was burnt, and the corn tortilla tasted a bit stale. They also put bell pepper in the enchilada and I'm not a fan of that, it takes away from the taste of the enchilada as a whole. Their enchilada sauce was bland, lacking pep, and even missing the spicy kick. As for there choices of hot sauce, both the red and green sauces missed the mark, both sauces had very little flavor, although the red sauce was a touch spicy. Overall the food was disappointing.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcaabab94b216b:0x636d438ef2ca9a42<//gmap_id></record>

I ordered a Carne Assad Burrito which was delicious but when they rang up my one burrito it came out to $9.15
I thought that was a bit expensive for a single burrito.< /Text>

I feel sorry for all these 5-star reviewers... maybe they're friends & family of the owners or something cuz this place has the worst carne asada I've ever eaten! Tough, dry, grissly & no seasoning at all... I got suckered by the good rating here, not good Mex food.<//text>

I have no idea how this place could have this
many stars... the food was horrible.  The people were nice.   I had the typical taco combo and the rice had ZERO taste... the beans were canned and had that "neutral" flavor and the carne asada was inedible... I actually thought it was chorizo at first but nope that was thier version of it.  You're better off going to Taco Bell.... no joke.  Go to Cucas in Mentone.... they seriously need to get a new cook or learn to make simple AUTHENTIC Mexican food....< /review>< user_name>

Gamestop.  The place where our childhood dreams because reality.  Also the place where our adult dreams can made.  Support your local B&M, the staff, who always have a passion for gaming, deserve the love.  It's been tough times for them, but thing will turn the corner soon!

I've been waiting to buy the new xbox, but I'm not going to buy it until I can buy it from Gamestop.< /review>

One time i waited in line for super smash bros brawl when i was in like the 4th grade. My mom let me and my brother stay home from school the next day so we spent all night and day playing and beat the campaign mode. Moral of the story is, get a cool mom and youll become a masterful gamer.< /text>

Sick and tired of trying to give my money to a place where they're clearly not interested in my business. The employees seldom want to help if it involves moving more than 2 feet from the counter or looking on any peg or shelf higher than 3 feet from the floor. Disinterested and almost as if my presence as a customer in their store was interrupting their game or texting. Sorry, but you won't have to worry for long. This will probably be another location they end up closing and we'll just buy from Amazon from here on out. Thanks for passing me by multiple times and never Once asking to help me..... You know... The only customer in the store.<//Text>

<text>I tend to pick up a few games that I play in my free time throughout the year. Not sure if it's a problem with quality control but about half of the used games I've received were defective. Sadly, by the time I get around to trying to play them, it's well outside the return policy.< /text></record></dataset><record>
<text>Nice place to shop for games and collectibles. Friendly employees.< /text>< response>

Nice food. Shared food court with mutiple other food outlets. Luleh kebab lentil soup and house salad together is awesome combo. Bit Pricey for a food court setup especially for sides.</text>

<review>I just had the yummiest meal ever with my family at Lamajoon! We ordered the chicken kebab and the beef kebab - they were both really tender and flavorful! We also loved the grilled veggies and other sides ! Everything was so tasty ... I would definitely recommend!< /review><gmapID>0x80c2ce52fd5f1807:0x515907721f01683f</gmapID><date>1599697228266< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>Bruna Jermann< /user_name>< pics>

<review>Wonderful food! ... everything - even the luscious breads and huge assortment of pastries - are fresh and homemade.  The service is fantastic - really over and above.  All the best of a family-run restaurant - you can feel the love in every way!  Definitely take the time to eat in - the plating and freshness can fully shine!  A real treasure!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Yikes, I hate to talk down on a business like this but this is the worst Mediterranean food I've ever had. The lamb shank was hard to cut it was so dry, and it just tasted...burnt. No flavor whatsoever on that or the side veggies. And for $15 I would expect it to come with hummus or tabouleh but they gave me hot sauce? I couldn't finish it.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Wow. Spend entire meal value over $30 usd and when ask for a glass of tap water they say they do not serve. But I can buy. Shame on you.<//review>

Whoever is employing ppl like Amal Gevorkyan who is with her daughter dragging people to court and without even their knowledge filing charges on them is a BOZ LIKE THEM! A person who gives money to this kind of ppl is no doubt a coward! What they're doing to there own daughters father Is just bozutyun! They doing this to put him in to the grave and it's going to happen soon! If u respect ursrlf! If u have dignity ! Don't give them money!<//review>

This place employes  straight out cheaters and scanners! One of them is their cook Amalia Gevorkyan who by the way is a crook and she gets section 8 and works here cash! I guess IRS didn't catch up to her but will  soon or later.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Eastern Mediterranean food. It is good and it is healthy, normal price. Perhaps there is a lack of variety in the drinks.

(Translated by Google) This Mediterranean restaurant seems to have only CI tadel in Los Angeles. There is no other branch. Although the small family and the crowd seem to be only a little more than the imitation Chinese dishes, they actually take it. It is also a long time to eat, so it is also a policy to give you a drink and then let you wait for the main meal.

Armenian Beef Luleh gave a bowl of rice, a toasted tomato and pepper, a scone, two minced meat strips and a comprehensive salad of green vegetables. When you eat it, you can obviously feel the addition of animal oil and surface baked. However, the meal at this price point here is also rich in weight.

(Original)
這家地中海料理店似乎在洛杉磯這邊還真的只有CI tadel這一家沒有別的分店的樣子，雖然小小一家、人潮也似乎只比旁邊的仿中國料理多一點點人，但實際排下去拿到餐也是天殺久，所以也同樣採取先給飲料再讓你等主餐的政策。

Armenian Beef Luleh 給了一碗飯、一顆烤焦了的番茄和辣椒、一張烤餅、兩條牛碎肉條和一坨綜合涼拌青菜，飯吃起來可以明顯感受到有加動物油和表層烤過，在這邊這個價位的餐點這樣也算份量豐富了。</Text>

(Translated by Google) My nephew and I stayed between 4:00 and 5:00 pm and were able to find something to eat and drink after 4:00 of Las Vegas. The dishes were succulent to our liking and the service impeccable. I will not hesitate to come back. 💖💖

Mon neveu et moi sommes passés entre 4h00 et 5h00 de l'après-midi et avons pu trouver de quoi nous restaurer et nous désaltérer après 4h00 de route de Las Vegas. Les plats étaient succulents à notre goût et le service impeccable. Je n'hésiterai pas à revenir. 💖💖</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The restaurant is said to be halal, but it contains pork and eaten from different regions (menu with pictures)
In other programs, people did not praise them, so I did not eat in it and did not encourage eating in it when I saw it, of course there are sessions and it is possible to use the lobby with other restaurants

(Original)
المطعم يقال انه حلال لكن فيه خنزير واكل من مناطق مختلفه (المنيو بالصور)
في البرامج الاخرى ما مدحوه الناس، لذلك ما اكلت فيه ولا تشجعت اكل فيه لما شفته، طبعا ما فيه جلسات وممكن تستخدم البهو مسائر المطاعم الاخرى<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I ordered the 3 piece meal and specifically asked for only legs and spicy. I got a breast and two wings once I opened the box and home. Will definitely check right at the drive thru going forward.<//Review>< pictures>

I always wanted to try @popeyeschicken because of all the hype with the spicy chicken sandwich. I finally decided to go because I have @TMobile and got a free chicken sandwich from @TMobileTuesday. After reading the awful reviews about the bad service, messed up orders and the long wait times in the drive thru I didn't want to go. Well, I decided to go anyways because my daughter really wanted to try it too. So on the way there, we ordered with the app and when we got there our order was ready with in a few minutes of our arrival. The drive thru didn't look to long and while I was eating I was watching the car go through which took maybe 20 minutes. Anyways, the food was delicious, the service was great. With covid in place the employee was very fast at bringing food outside to the table. I'm sorry for all you people that had a bad experience, mine was very pleasant and I'm glad I went.< /Review>

<Review>Food and service is good.
Neighborhood not so good.
Car next to me when they finished eating threw everything out of their window. Have them a look and they offered a finger... They need some security or something as this was not the first time we saw this.<//Review>< Name>

Your chicken and fish  sandwiches  dry  nothing looked on tv. We ordered  thru for door dash and we asked for sides  just the sandwiches. I would  like  to  see you shut down or pee in you. I got  sick  off  your fish  SANDWICH.< /review>

The food is typical fast food; but the real aggravation about this place is the parking lot/drive up line.  Once you get in the slow moving drive up line cars short cutting from the adjacent strip mall to Jamacha Road road rage - chicken challenge drivers in the drive up line and the drivers will get out of their car to verbally assault drivers in line.  Since most of them 'reflect the local community' and will play a race card if you don't run in fear, I just avoid this place after feeling threatened twice.< /text>

We are looking forward to returning and trying their sea food menu.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>The ABSOLUTE WORST customer service I have ever experienced! This owner should be ashamed of the employees at this location. I came through the drive through and waited 20 minutes for them to give me the wrong order! I had to get out and wait for someone to open the door to help me . Not only was the “ woman “ inside eating laughing at the fact I was standing there waiting for someone to help me the little girl who came out to ask me “what I wanted” was so rude . She’s lucky she has a job with that attitude! I’ll never visit this location again and make sure your employees are properly trained before hiring them.

This review is not about the food quality! It’s about the customer service.
On Thanks Giving day I went to this store to buy turkey and I paid the amount before they bring it. When they brought a huge frozen turkey to the counter, I changed my mind because I was alone and wanted refund. This is were the problem starts. They charged my card one more time instead of the refund and when I showed my bank app to tell them what they’ve done, they replied “That’s how it shows but you’ll get the refund within 3 days” after five days I still see both deductions on my account. So, I went back to resolve it. They got my phone number to notify me when it’s resolved. Another week, nothing. I called back three more times repeating the same story until I called their corporate office. They said we’ll resolve that ASAP. Two weeks later, still nothing happened. After wasting more than 7 hours of driving back and forth and phone calls for a product and service that I never received, finally I disputed the payment with my credit card company and got my money back. They don’t know what they’re doing. I’ve been at Popeyes 3 times in my life but that would be my last one ever!<//Review>

I'm gonna start off by rating this place a 3 which is not bad but its not the best and don't get me wrong I love popeyes chicken.. I went there last night and like any other popeyes the line was literally down the street, so I order my food on the app and I get it quickly but they mess up my order and ski.ped me on a sandwich.. then you can tell that the food was put together in a hurry but with no love. All sloppy. Over all stuck to your normal popeyes chicken spot cause this one is to high in demand for them to keep up<//Review>

Evey time I go they are out of chicken sandwiches.. the line takes 30 minutes, there is no sign saying they are out (only one saying they are serving them between 10:00 - 9:00). So I let the employee know that it would be helpful if they could post a sign so you don't wait in line for nearly an hour if you don't want to.

Then the employee argues with me stating that one is posted.. NOPE!!!

WHATEVER! Just process my order and do the right thing for the customer.

Post the sign.. ugh!</Review>

Sadly this place is so good that today in drive thru, some stinker of a lady cut the line in front of 7 people by entering from Main st.  Then she yells at the people she cut off.  Dangerously delicious, people just aren’t themselves when they’re hungry.  Also, Jennifer in drive thru is super nice, with 10+ cars in drive thru, she performed flawlessly.  Thanks Jennifer!< /text>

Worst food pick up experience of my life. Ordered online for myself and the person at the door won't give me the food I paid for already because I can't show her the photo on my phone of the order that I placed on my computer back at home? The lady giving me most of the grief doesn't even understand half of what I'm saying and has to have her coworker translate for her. I tell them that if they're not going to give me it to just cancel my order and give me a refund. they say I have to do it online back at home. Of course there is literally no way to get a refund or cancel an order on their website.</Review>

Friendly service and good food. Watch for specials--often runs out. Chicken sandwiches are good value and ,depending on what you expect, are pretty good for the money. They ran out of the Voodoo special however. The service could be streamlined a bit I think. In any event,,... I'll be back.<//Review>

I really don’t like this Popeyes. I understand things are quarantined and only operate through the drive thru but not much has changed even before this. I’m not taking shots either. Just hat it is. I don’t feel like this store looks to resolve their speed of service to the customers. You can’t call in any orders in advance for some delivery service jobs, nor will the manager work with you to help expedite the customers yet instead you spend a hour line for your food. This is not practical nor convenient for anyone and it’s very frustrating.</Text>

Thought I'd finally try this infamous chicken sandwich that's created such a frenzy, and I wasn't disappointed. I don't typically care for white meat (breast) due to it being dry, but the meat was thick, and surprisingly tender and juicy. Also, the string beans were bomb!!! Usually restaurants don't do well with vegetables, but Popeye's nailed this one! Absolutely delicious!</Text>

<Text>This afternoon we went to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen it had been a long time since I had their chicken. We got a 9 piece chicken special that came with two large sides and biscuits. We got the spicy chicken that I love and I like those little packets of hot sauce.  Service was quick and friendly. The price was also good for us.< /Text>< Rating>

Ok, I got the original chicken sandwich and spicy chicken, pretty good sandwiches and priced well.  Nice people working there and what was really amazing, both chicken sandwiches were wrapped up but no great any where on the wrapping or the outer part of the bun, I ate in the car with no mess or having to look for something to wipe my hands with.  Highly recommend.< /review>

Can't go inside in the drive-through is a wreck $7 worth of chicken cost $12 worth of gas idling  MA drive-through the couldn't support the turning radius of my truck having to rely on  The person behind me To give me enough space to backup and go forward about 5 times and finally drive over the sidewalk within a curly pubic hair of a pole
that  Has been strategically placed to take out your left rear Fender  If you have a bigger pick up truck such as a 4 to 50 or 350 or in my case a Chevy 2500 crew cab especially if your truck is lifted like mine. couldn't get red beans and rice because apparently everyone was hoarding it only one chicken sandwich per vehicle not enough crack in the flour but dam the chicken sure was good and those instant potatoes with that gravy is still a fat guys  Nervana even the Cajun rice and Cajun fries  That you have to ask for crispy because they don't know how to cook fries anywhere anymore literally told the person on the microphone 3 times I don't want your 2 minute fries  Just to get them right and cook The only thing missing for a Perfect healthy deep fried meal here would be the hot chick Letting you eat all that off of her naked hotbody  While she whispers at you bite that chicken take a scoop of those potatoes come on dip that biscuit in the gravy fatboy That would be the perfect meal.< /Text>

<review>Popeye's Chicken is always a delicious meal choice but definitely on the expensive side when feeding the whole family. You can usually find a discount on a bucket or a big meal deal with sides and biscuits. Definitely be prepared to wait if you go to this location around dinner time as this seems to be their busiest time of day, that's not a complaint but more of an observation. They also deliver and take online orders so there are ways around the wait. Staff is pretty friendly here.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

If I could give zero I would, the Manager Blanca Marquez is very incompetent and instead of fixing an order, she would rather call the cops. I understand we live in an urban environment but to treat people like they are criminals Instead of fixing the situation, then she should not be in charge! I was out on a job working to serve a customer, delivering their food and where we both should be in it together, they are working against the grain, by working against you. A simple fix turned into a nightmare and cooperate should definitely be involved! They hire crazy people who think it’s funny to set customers back with time and money, then do nothing to correct it. Too bad it’s only a few stores in site, but it’s worth the time and travel to avoid this place at any cost, because I’m the end it will cost you time, money, and stress.< /review>

<review>Food was alright.  Got the boneless chicken wings, seemed like more batter than chicken.  Got small mashed and small coleslaw.  Mashed potatoes were good but the slaw had way too much sugar somewhere. It was overwhelmingly sweet.  Kind of gross, couldn't finish it.</review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Went into the El Cajon Popeye's after checking out their new website and downloading a discount code. I needed to download the app in order to use it, but I hadn't done it and the code was only good for 15 minutes. But the manager stepped in, told me what I had to do, and gave me the  coupon price even though I didn't have the coupon. She was so kind and patient with me! And, as always, the chicken was perfect. Thank you, Popeye's! I'll be back.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I stopped in for a quick snack and was delightfully pleased. They were offering a little bit of popcorn shrimp for $2.49. it was spicy and hot and delicious, and a very generous serving.

The young woman at the cash register apparently didn't know that it's appropriate to be pleasant, but I didn't let that spoil my experience. I'll be baaaack!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Service was pleasant, efficient, and quick. Food was very hot, freshly prepared. Delicious! Restaurant is kept clean and dining room well maintained.
I asked for the little handi wipes and the young lady had to go to the back to restock them, she did so with a smile and friendly manner. I recommend!</Text>< Pics>

Shout out to Kayla who helped us out this evening. She was amazing over the headset, very attentive, and clear. She apologized for a very quick "wait" and then she had to give us fresh tenders and apologized again for the wait-- I will happily wait for fresh food! Overall, I was impressed by her.

As for Popeyes overall, we come ever month or two, it was always good and we have never had any issues. But today we felt we were given exceptionally great service.< /Review>

<user>105492983844767907443</user><review>Funny how all your commercials, your app and website says delivery is on you but yet non of your stores actually offer any delivery! I believe that’s called false advertisement and you could potentially face a lawsuit for that.

It’s called making a contract with Grubhub, Uber Eats, Postmates, or Doordash and I know all of them deliver in and around all store locations in San Diego so either take it off all platforms or start to actually offer it!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Really cool deal on Tuesday. 2 pieces of chicken, side, biscuit and a drink for around $6.99. maybe a little cheaper. Crispy and spicy. Someone told me they been all around and Popeye's has the best red beans and rice, we tried it and they were good.<//Text>

<text>The green beans were perfect, my chicken sandwich was from shelved stock and wasn't really that fresh.  The drink selection was grim, I just tossed the new cup in the trash, didn't find what I needed to drink, and I don't care for El Cajon Tap water to much...  Sorry for not offering a better review.

The service was very friendly and quick. The people who don't know how to drive and  cause accidents is enough to not want to ever go again. If a cop wanted to write up 20 tickets in 20 minutes then I'd go to popeyes parking lot.</review>

UPDATE!:Went back to Popeyes to get another one of those delicious chicken sandwiches, had the pleasure of interacting with Fernando, 🤙Fernando was very kind helpful and very attentive , he is a great example of great customer service thank you Fernando🤙

Went to Popeyes for that chicken sandwich , definitely recommend the spicy , as a chik-fil-a fan I was heart broken cause Popeyes Chicken sandwich beat them on all fronts ,  flavor,texture, price and probably most notably availability since Popeyes is open on Sunday found a new fast food place I will probably visit again<//Review>

When the chicken sandwich came back...these employees were working so hard and fast. I ordered my sandwich and within 5 mins it was out. I did wait in line for 10 mins but it was busy for that day. Very pleased and the employees were also super helpful and we did our survey and got a wing meal free. Thanks.</Text>

Love the flavor but it seems that they never have enough to fill my order. I had to wait over 5 minutes for them to cook my order which was okay since I drove back to Alpine with them in my car. We also eat at the one in Palm Desert but I believe that these boneless chicken wings are better then the ones in Palm Desert which is sort of strange since they should be the same but they are breaded at the location so that might be the reason. Be careful of the sweet tea it is extremely sweet. Love the red beans and rice also< /Review><Rate>4</Rate>< Response>

If you are here for the chicken sandwich, just go to Chick-fil-A. I had the regular chicken sandwich and it tasted like nothing it was so plain. On the other hand my friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and he said it was pretty good and just as good as Chick-fil-A.< /Text>

Long lines, a little dirty...
Everybody wants those new sandwiches... the staff can barley keep up.
Still good food, so worth the wait.<//Text>

I was going to get the 8 piece. But it would have cost 28 dollars. But they have a 9 piece for 23 dollars. And the girl didn't tell me about the deal they have. So I said something to her about it at the window. Her co-workers heard me explaining why she didn't tell me about the deal. So in my opinion very bad customer service. I won't go back.!!!!< /text>

Chicken sandwhich was very good! Service was extremely slow. The lady on the register would ring someone up, fill their order, collect the money, and then ring the next guest. Had she of had a food runner the line would have flowed much faster. I waited in line almost 20 mins just for someone to take my order. It would have been faster for me to go through the drive thru.<//Review>

If you love fried chicken as much as i do, Popeyes is my No. 1 choice!  Why?  Its perfectly seasoned, not super salty like the others,  battered lightly & tastes so fresh & juicy, underneath its crunchy, golden fried batter.  We have one location here in El Cajon, CA, and always steady  busy, wc is a good indicator that the product is good, as well as the service.  The Staff is very accommodating, pleasant, always a smile & " thank you" for me.  It would do them well to update the image of their store, could use a fresh coat of paint inside & out, clean up landscaping, re-stripe parking lot, fix broken signs & displays outside, clean up drive thru (paint,  wash windows, remove debris from drive way).  It doesn't take much expense plus elbow grease to make this store spiffy & shine. Which goes w the dining room & restrooms inside.  A clean store represents a very good & successful operating  food business, wc draws more patronage.< /Review>

Very friendly and helpful staff.  Pointed out the special, which was just what I wanted.  Let me amend my order, then 2 separate workers gave a cheery happy new year as I left.  Good food, good price, good staff.  What more do you need?</Review>

<review>Love the food. The Jumbalaya is bomb.
But now they force you to buy a combo.
I don’t want the drink but yet have to pay for it anyway.
So now instead of a couple times a week.
It’s once every couple months.
Stupid business move in my opinion.<//review>< Time>

Just went there for that chicken sandwich everyone is talking about. I can confirm that the hype is overblown. They are selling $1 or $2 chicken sandwiches for $4.</review>

Popeys is always good. And if you use there app from olay store they have some really good family deals and single meal deals as well went there using there coupon for 14 pieces of mixed chicken. Which came with alot of breast meat 2 large sides and 8 biscuits for 22$ fair deal to me. Just be careful when using coupon that little lousiana symbol will keep spinning and youll want to back out dont becuase it will say you used that coupon just show them with it spinning they no what to do.  And dont forget that cajun sparkle dang that stuff is the best. Just remember 1 pack will go a long way</Text>

Nothing beats this fried chicken. On my last visit the lady at the drive thru was super nice, sweet, and made me feel like family. I've never had that in my 32 years at a fast food restaurant. Oh and love their gravy on the mashed potatoes.< /review>

<text>Used to go to the one on Jamacha rd in El Cajon every Monday after work to bring food home for dinner. I always ordered the Dinner Meal w no drink. As of now, this is no longer an option.  The "owner" has decided all meals MUST be a combo + added an extra 2 bux to the price. I don't drink soda, and I am angry I would be forced to purchase one with my meal for extra money. I will no longer patronize any Popeyes owned byt this person.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d9590996370eb3:0x8411b5e3c0414577< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>The whole crew of employees in there are very rude have no customers service at all. I went in last night at about 8:40pm and stand in front of the cashier for about 10 minutes without been help, not to say there are 6 employees running around trying to close the shop at 9 PM. After that long wait, one of the employees takes my order, like someone is torturing her to work, she was giving me this attitude how long to make this order because they have to bake it. 20 minutes after the order I got my food, so i ask for honey for the biscuits then the other guy (employee) would not want to give me the honey because I did order any food that need honey, so the other girl jumped in and says that we are out of honey with an attitude on her face.  What good food place with a bunch of bad customers service employees is a waste. If I could give them a zero star for this review I would. Worse customers service ever I seem. I hope Popeyes Corporation would see this review and I believe the manager there don't give a damn about this review or any reviews of this horrible customer service place.< /text><pics>None<//pics><user>118027052993100564614< /user>< username>

No one spoke in English except the man at the counter, not that it's a problem... I just felt like I was in another country. Food was good, fast, and restrooms were very clean and secured. I almost drove past it from Main street, because it's tucked in further than the street.< /text>

For a quick meal on the go that's finger licking good, Popeyes is the place to go. Never disappoints!!</review>

<Review>Service was ok, but chicken breast and wings were too hot to eat straight away. Very little meat on the breast and wings. Not sure how you can make the breading so dry and the meat so greasy, but the overall effect was stomach churning. Sons chicken tenders were stringy,  had to be the cheapest meat. Fries and biscuit were ok though.</Review><time>1545317338896< /time>< user_name>

Why haven't they opened for carryout? This is why there's always a line for the slow drive thru. They're taking this coronavirus issue too far and these precautions aren't necessary. Can't see why this place has a 4 Star rating when service is 1 Star. I guess people like bad service.<//Review>

<Review>I can understand small mistakes like types of fries, or salad dressing, but I ordered some of the mildest wings they have heard (I'm not very spice tolerant) and when I take a bite it turns out they had given me the ghost pepper wings.

Since I ordered to go and opened it at home I had no choice but to just discard the food and dig into a tub of yogurt.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The chicken taste pretty good.. when they have chicken available. I've been here 3 times in the past 2 months and each time I've been told that we have to wait 20-25 mins to get 11 peices of chicken and a large mash potatoes! To top it all off they're so stingy with the hot sauce its ridiculous. I just want 2 handfuls of Louisiana Hot Sauce thrown in the bag without the judgemental look for crying out loud! Overall, when they have chicken its OK. Just don't go during the dinner rush.<//Review>

<Text>First time trying. Chicken was cooked and still had plenty of grease. Supposed to be Louisana style in which I was not impressed. Flavors were not as I remember when I ate in Louisana. Have had much better. Customer service was very slow and unattentitive. May try again but, there are more southern style places that are more authentic and not just a brand. Update 01/21/2020: place closed by county health.<//Text><user_name>Simply RAD<//user_name>< Rate>

It's Popeyes. You know what you're getting.
Biscuits and red beans & rice are the reasons for being here. The chicken is decent.<//review>

I always enjoyed Popeyes.  The chicken and the customer service is usually very good, but this time I had one of the worst fast food experiences ever. I came through the drive through with my friend and order food. I make it to the window and here comes this rather fat and rude girl( dont know her name..just know she's fat). Tells me the amount to pay and takes my card and slams the window.  I waited about 3 minutes to get my card back and another 4 to get my food ready. She comes hands my food, as I give my thanks, she slams the window.  So, me having a habit of looking through my order for missing food. Found out that I was missing a lot of the sauces I order.  Now granted I didn't mind paying 25 cents for each sauce, but since my friends and I were all eating the big meal. I bought 4 of each sauce.  She only gave me 1 of each. So, I drive through the drive through again. I tell her nicely that she forgot the sauces, she tells me I'm wrong and that It was inside the boxes. I show her and she goes inside and get more sauces. The coworkers were all extremely rude and talking bad about us while we waited( which I understand that getting a lot of sauces is a bit funny, but they get paid to serve food in a professional way
..I hope). As I pull out my card to pay for the sauces, since at the time I believed she might of not charge me for them.  She comes up and hands me a bag full of sauces and while I was apologizing and trying to explain why I needed all the sauces. She slams the window on me again! It would all of all been fine if the chicken was not cold.....which is was. Hope they replace the girls working there for better ones...especially the fat one.< /text>

< Review>
Just went through the drive-thru, chicken strips that I ordered were cold. I ordered red beans and rice, they tasted funny. They didn't give me a spoon or fork to eat them with but  at least they were hot unlike the chicken. Biscuit was  hot and tasted good. Cinnamon apple turnover was cold. 7 bucks on cold and not tasty food....</Review>

I was not impressed with the food at this store...
Over cooked and under flavored.</Text>

< review>
I had a coupon for a Dinner for 2 for 8.99 that was 5 TENDERS, 2 reg sides, and 2 biscuits. I ordered, and the lady taking my order seemed sweet, at the time. As I went to the window, she had the audacity to tell me i couldn’t get ay sauce without being charged.... note that i had 5 tenders and 2 sides of fries... what do you mean i don’t get sauce? are you kidding me??  i just got home and she gave me everything BUT tenders. i’m very disappointed in the service this lady gave me and i’m extremely annoyed that people can’t do a simple job.  I wish i knew her name. step your game up popeyes.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I was hungry to try popeyes chicken becuase last time I try when I was traveling in victorville  it was good. I ask them can I have there special $5 . They told me we dont have what I am looking for becuase every franchise  have different  items . That is very strange. I told them no spicy. I eat the chicken after few hour my stomach so bad becuase I eat spicy food.
The customer service was no good. I will not recommend this location.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I just bought two orders at this location. The customer service was horrible. I order a 3 piece tender, and they are the smallest pieces a baby could have...and I'm an adult. I asked the girl for more beans then rice and there's ALL rice and a small amount of beans. Worst service I've received at any Popeyes and I eat there often. I'll never return back to that one again.<//review>

< Review>
Don't go here ... you will be sick after. Both me and my boyfriend got sick after a few hours went by. I was excited to eat popeyes for the first time and drove a long ways to try it. Not saying all popeyes is bad but this one is. Plus all the staff yells at each other. Just over all a bad experience. Drive down to another popeye's.<//Review>

I ordered a 4pc meal, fries, and apple pie. They charged me extra for a sauce to go with the chicken 😡! Go to the one on Santo Rd: they give you 1 sauce for 3pc meal, 2 sauces for 5pc meal, etc.</text>

Compared to popeyes chicken at el cajon boulevard, their chickens are too salty and less  crunchies. If I had chance to travel farther, I would absolutely avoid this store. The cashiers were greeting and thanking as they supposed to be but less friendly. The male cashier took long time to put codes inside the system but after all he seemed realized couldn't do it and finally call the other crew to help him. 😣. Okay, we could waiting but we hope that he wont meet the unpatient customer later.<//text>
