I grew up in and Italian neighborhood bad East and I have not had food this authentic in a while. I am very picky when it comes to Italian food and this place is authentic. If you are in the area check it out. Great wine list too.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgGkAiLaEXDsBPwYqyQD4hewlAYHLgKjl8rhed=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

The restaurant is not easily seen from the street. It is tucked away behind another building. The setting is quaint and the service is great. The menu is authentic Italian and very flavourful. Presentation is equally impressive. We come here for work functions and have never been disappointed. Desserts are delicious.< /text>

Horrible place! Extremely rude service. Just walked into this place to celebrate hubby's birthday, restaurant was pretty much empty, asked the waitress if we could have the corner table and she rudely said it's not available! I would never go back here.< /text>

<Text>Really nice restaurant in a surprisingly out of the way location.  Would be 5 stars excpet for the prices (which are really only a half star off, so call it a 4.5).  The owners have been proudly cooking and serving tableside since it opened in 2007.  The portions are not huge, but probably just right (although the prices would be a better match for larger portions).  Very good flavors, fresh ingredients.   Nice ambiance.  Comfortable seating, always a nice crowd--this isn't an Olive Garden.    The wine list is good, and the wine prices are well within reason.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Date>

Looks like they're open again!
[Original post]: This place sounds really interesting from reviews but they are temporarily closed due to a fire next door. Hopefully they re-open soon. I want to try it out.</review>

Main dish was overcooked and lacked flavor.  Salad was ok.  The bread was good.  Staff was very friendly, but service was slow.  Nice atmosphere.< /review>

Their house version is also not bad but pricey! Don't trust the menu prices that's shown in Google - go to their website for updated menu!
They don't have a kids menu - atleast during dinner time that I went there. So be prepared to shell out full price if you're bringing kids with you.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><username>Anantha Seshadri< /username><date>1481154523451<//date>< Rating>

My fiancé and I had a great experience at this place. It's hard to find a place like this on this side of the bay. The pasta was delicious and the dessert was to die for (we had the chocolate raspberry gelato, highly recommended!). The place is quiet and the food came out quickly!</text>

Presentation and customer service was above par, the bruschetta was excellent, but the entrees were over priced and slightly over salted.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>My car was towed from the front of my house by this company, out of nowhere, for seemingly no reason, with no notice.  I’m a young college student paying myself through college renting a room because it’s all I can afford and they told me the bill was going to be over 800$. I called and said I’d like to just junk the car so I don’t  have to pay the bill because there’s no possible way for me to. I was told that I could junk the car but I would still have to pay the bill of 800$. So they towed my car without notifying me they were doing it, and now are telling me if I don’t pay the bill they’ll sell it in 45 days and it’ll rack up an even higher bill AND they have no financing or payment plan option. So what do I do? There’s nothing I can do and now I’m losing my car and this is going on my credit. This is such a scam and it honestly shouldn’t even be legal.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

AMAZING SERVICE! Colin is my hero!! Safe, friendly & professional. He made sure we were safe & then drove us the 10 mile drive home that took 2 1/2 hours. I can't imagine why there are negative reviews. I was stranded on the 118 fwy with my puppy for hours during the worst traffic jam I've ever seen: 8hr backup. They gladly dispatched a driver who went above & beyond to get to me even though the jam prevented easy access to my location. Dave's is the best!< /review>

<Review>Parks in 5 car stall in front of business “waiting for food” and says its ok for him to take up the spots. Absolutely rude and inconsiderate of people who need those spots when every other spot was open. Since I’m not the only 1 star review I understand why this company has a bad reputation.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1596064789556, 'text': 'Hello Paul,\n\nI received your complaint and I would like to gather a little more information from you so that I can reconcile the situation. Customer and public perception of our company is very important to us and we take negative reviews very seriously.\n\nWhat was the location (restaurant/city) and the date that you saw the tow truck parked in front of?\n\nThank you for your time.\nJanice K'}<//response>< gmap_id>

Inside this large museum are two large galleries and two smaller ones. The permanent collection features art by local artists. The rest of the rotating exhibits feature a mix of art from all over.

The outside grounds of the museum are home to some beautiful gardens and sculptures.< /Review>< Name>

Wonderful museum. I was actually shocked at how nice it was. I wasn't expecting much because I was judging it based on that it's in Bakersfield. So sorry I judged and so happy we came</text>

The exhibits are great and educational for kids. We went to the rainforest and to the gem and skin exhibits which were a great learning experience. I honestly was impressed the most by the beautiful butterflies.<//Review>

I love this place but was disappointed the Rain Forest exhibit was closed. My favorite part was simulated flying like a pterosaur - the new name for pterodactyls. Lots of fun. Scientists have learned a lot about them since I went to school. Also enjoyed displays about evolution of the earth's crust and the beautiful gift shop. Prices in the cafe are a bit expensive tho. Still worth a visit!< /Text>

< Review>
Visited with my daughter and her fiancé as a possible venue for their wedding. The museum is beautiful; the grounds were also very beautiful, very green and well maintained overall. But the gazebo needs a little bit of a refurbishing and paint, and apparently there was a mishap with a prior landscaper where some bushes and vines were affected. But they are coming back nicely. Would have been a great wedding venue, only the time frame was off for us.</Review>

Nicely curated exhibits with a local flavour. Quite limited in the number of exhibits - I was in and out in half an hour. Probably not worth the $10 admission 😌<//Review>

Always a great place to visit. You can walk back to the gardens in back and sit in the gazebo, something I like doing for lunch. They have good events regularly, and interesting exhibits.< /text>

HOWEVER
I Purchased a family   membership and was told I could bring my 5 list grandchildren who where written on the card by the worker who sold the membership  to me.
When I brought my  5 grandchildren to the Laurie Brock museum  on 8-1-18 I was told only 2 of them were allowed at one time....
Fraud
The reason I purchased the membership  was so I could have time with all of the cousins together.  I asked about it at time of purchase and was told, no problem, just show the card.  Lies...
Very disappointing.
8-1-18
Just asked to speak with a supervisor
I was informed that 2 adults and 6 children  are  allowed and the girl at admissions  made a mistake.</review>< Pictures>

We stopped without any expectations as we were passing through-just wanted to see what art was happening in Bakersfield.  Wow, were we blown away by the great art and curation.  A nice mix of local and international artists.  The different exhibits meant there was something for every taste.  You can easily spend a couple hours and come away refreshed!< /review>

I'll be very honest,I love the artwork but I don't ever want to go back there to visit due to an employee,Juana Martinez,who continuously takes photos of me without permission and doesn't care whether you like it or not . She seems to  be more on her personal cell phone taking sneaky pictures of people than doing her job .I don't mean to talk down about her ,only her actions and that is why I can't go there to support the museum.</text>

<text>Dr. Hakim and his entire crew were so great. Super friendly, informative and helpful as we work to correct the years of grinding and clenching I’ve done to destroy my teeth and bite. Highly recommend.</text>< name>

After consulting with several orthodontists in Los Angeles who all said I needed to have a big jaw surgery, my dentist Larry Kozek referred me to Dr Hakim. I was very relieved that I was able to get my bite fixed without surgery, instead using traditional braces. Dr hakim is a very talented orthodontist who can fix issues that most others can't. He was always accommodating and patient. Really great staff too. My teeth look great. The cost of the treatment was quite affordable, especially for Beverly Hills< /text>

It has been the best experience in every visit.  Dr. Hakim and team took care of me through my first set of braces 20+ years ago, as well as my son’s braces starting when he was in fourth grade (he Is now 17) and now Dr. Hakim is helping me to correct a few small changes to my smile (as I did not wear my night guards/retainer as I should have way back when.). I am so appreciative for Dr. Hakim and his entire team.<//review>< username>

<time>1597698046589</time><text>I am very thankful to God for Dr. Hakim and his amazing staff. I would not trust my daughter's teeth to anyone but the best. That is why I was willing to drive 60 miles from Palmdale to get to Dr. Hakim's clinic. My own dentist was wearing braces at the time and I asked him who is his orthodontist. He said that he goes to Dr. Hakim.  I could n't have a better testimony than that.
Dr. Hakim is not only one of the best in his field but also has a good heart.  He treated my daughter with utmost care and kindness. He has great passion for what he does and loving to his patients.
The staff is so friendly and willing to go extra to help make everyone comfortable.
May God continue to bless Dr. Hakim and his staff.< /text></record>

Dr. Hakim was the orthodontist for both of my great-nephews, and my niece recommended him for my sons when it became clear they would need braces.  Braces with Dr. Hakim will cost more than at the average orthodontist, but the expense is well worth the result.  I had a horrific experience with my own braces, and I did not want my sons to suffer the same way.  My older son had his braces taken off today after five years during which his whole jaw was realigned, and he looks sensational!  I also don't have to worry about problems down the line from bad orthdonture.  Now my younger son is going through Phase 2, his second round of braces (I started him at eight, as his teeth were very crooked), and I know I'll have a similar beautiful result.  Don't think that you can't afford this wonderful orthodontist in Beverly Hills--you can. Chat with Lourdes, the office manager (a super-nice lady from Spain), and she can work out a plan for you.  I recommend Dr. Hakim and his staff with no reservations.  They're very, very nice and professional, and they have great coffee and wifi you can take advantage of while your kids are receiving treatment.  They also validate for parking, so it's not that expensive, and your car will be safe in the underground parking.</text>

This is the 2nd go-round for me; wish Dr. Hakim had been my orthodontist when I was a child because I would have had it done right the first time.  Only doctor I've ever seen whose first question was "what is YOUR priority for this treatment" - what a great question!  He sees each patient's individual needs.  Office staff is so kind and helpful.</review>< gmap_id>

My family has had wonderful results with Dr Hakim.  Dr Hakim created a night guard for me, to protect my jaw and teeth against the damage wrought by clenching and grinding.  Dr Hakim invited me to come back as often as I needed for any readjustments over time (at no extra charge).  Meanwhile, my twelve year old daughter has had great progress in her orthodontic treatment with Dr Hakim and his colleagues, who have been very patient when my daughter has had broken brackets and who really care about the progress of the patient.  We have recommended the ortho spaceship to all our friends in need of orthodontic treatment.  In addition to the first class orthodontic treatment, we have been grateful for the very attentive care of the non-clinical staff, who are all very knowledgeable and kind and courteous.  Thank you to everyone at the ortho spaceship for fabulous professional service and personal attention!<//Review>

Prior to seeing Dr. Hakim I had undergone orthodontic treatment on 3 separate occasions (the second episode lasted 7 years) without positive conclusion.  Upon initiating treatment with Dr. Hakim he informed me that I would most likely be a surgical patient.  I started splint therapy and over the course of the next 6 months my temporomandibular disorder pain resolved.  As my orthodontic treatment progressed with braces it became clear that I would indeed require surgery.   The final results of my orthodontics after surgery were mind blowing!  I have a healthy bite and no longer suffer with jaw pain (it's now 2 years post treatment).   Dr. Hakim is a brilliant, skilled and kind orthodontist.  I will be forever grateful to Dr. Hakim and my orthognathic surgeons - Drs. Gunson and Arnett in Santa Barbara.  Clearly, this time I was in the right place for the type of care that I needed.
Thank you so much!< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>went to get a pedicure and manicure not happy with the way they turned out. They left the gel and polish around my cuticles for both my manicure and pedicure and they took way too long to complete the services especially since I had two people working on me at once. They redid my pedicure but I didn’t have time to get my manicure fixed. I was there for over an hour. The lady who did my manicure told me that I chose a difficult color... it was a pink color and she only needed to do 2 coats. She asked me “ do you like it? You won’t come in tomorrow to get them redone right?” At that point I just wanted to leave... never going back!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1622560413894, 'text': 'Hi, we are so sorry about your negative experience at our store.

Go to VIP nails instead no good customer service I went in to get a full set they didn’t want to do it because I had really nice nails on one hand and they were I guess intimidated? I told them to take them off and start a fresh set still they gave me a hard time Irene went to go hide in the back terrible day place good for kids not adults<//review>

Went for a pedicure, lady rushed even though the shop was empty. I had gel on my toes before but wanted to replace it with just a regular color noticed she never soaked the gel off at all just
Used the drill when I told her I could still see the clear coat she got irritated and drilled harder. Color
Was horrible and lumpy when I brought this up she just kept painting over it. Was not Offered to put my feet under the UV lights to help them dry faster and was told they didn’t have the courtesy disposable sandals so I was told to sit there for an hour until my toes were dry. I hardly leave bad reviews I’m typically easy going and can brush off a bad experience but I was really
Shook at the lack of effort or even response to my comments.</Review>

<username>Vanessa Thompson</username><review>I walked in at 7 PM for a full set and a color change on my toes. Sat down to get my toes done and they said they needed to run my card before I got my nails done because they were running the end of day. I was fine with it. Now I have been sitting in the chair for 45 minutes waiting to get my nails done and they came up to me with my card and the receipt saying they refunded my $45 for my nails and charge me $15 for a color change on my toes, and that my money would be refunded by Tuesday.< /review></record>

<review>I absolutely loved and enjoyed my manicure! The lady was very friendly and made sure my hands felt amazing! When it was time to get my acrylic set I was a little nervous because this was my first time. The lady made sure I loved the length, the lines were perfect, and made sure they were the same length as the other hand! It didn’t even hurt at all. The workers were very funny and chill.To sum everything up I really enjoyed my time at cover nails inside Sierra Vista Mall!</review>< pics>

<review>Bad customer service. Overpriced for a regular set of colored nails. My gf said the old lady trimmed off so much nail that it was soo thin and fragile. The nails fell off within 4 days. Payed $45 and not coming here anymore.< /review><GmapID>0x80945c76034b4a45:0xa5df195967cc1b85<//GmapID>< user_name>

I've tried a lot of places and I keep coming back to Cover Nails because their gel polish lasts for almost a month!! One place I  went to the polish started chipping off the next week😞
I really like VUE she is funny, fast & does great work!  😊
Great hours... gotta try it🖒</Text>

<Text>He forgot to prime one hand of my acrylics. I asked him and he said “no I did it. I have too” ok. My nails fell off within a week. For $45+ dollars? No thanks. I won’t be returning.<//Text>< Pics>

Very crowded. Chairs and tables are very close together. Pedicure chairs are super comfy with remotes to control the massagers. They seem to always be short staffed. The wait is horrendous.<//Review>

Decent, place, I've had bad experience before so it's nothing new to me.  Just needed better communication with the workers.</text>

I came one day for a pedi And I dont go anywhere eles! The staff is so sweet, and my toe nails are always perfectly strait and great polish. I recommend the gel pedi, which is 40$ but they massage and exfoliate plus it last me about a month before I need to go back. I had Tina ,which was so polite and just made me feel comfortable! They do recommended apt. Which I do to
, or eles you wait 25 to 30 mins! Definitly worth the waith for pedi. Going to get mani next week. If bad Ill update the review.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>Came in to asked for square shape short nails, and i leave with duck nails. Owner/manicurist was cutting me alot, would get distracted alot, took 2 hours to get this ugly horrendous nails on, uneven, bubbled on gel, doesn’t seem to know how to shape or file a nail and has been working on nails for 10 yrs. instead of shaping actual nail would file my skin, and he has glasses dont know why he can’t see. I also let him know i only had an hour to get them done, don’t know how much time usually takes but he could’ve told me it was going to take me more time but no he still decided to to them. I paid $40 not worth it, very bad experience with this old man.<//review>< Pics>

Wow if you want to feel like a princess you must come here! It is so sanitary and relaxing! I have never had an experience quite like the one I enjoyed here. I've been to many places not knowing I had been wasting my money going any where else! I will be back monthly to have some much needed pampering. I couldn't be happier.</Review>

< Review>
My best friend and I went to this salon to get her nails done for her birthday. The manager did her manicure and was rough with her hand, cutting her several times. He then proceeded to ask her personal questions about her scars on her arm. The manage continued to raise the price of her manicure from $25 to $30, then to $35. She did not get any add ons to the manicure. When she got out of the salon, she noticed her nails were runny and the nail polish was starting to bubble. The manager proceeded to raise the price and charged her $70 for her and her friend's manicure, when it was supposed to be $50 or $55. We asked for our money back and they called mall security. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! WE NEVER WANT TO DO BUSINESS HERE EVER AGAIN AND WE STILL WANT OUR MONEY BACK!</Review>

<Review>Very disappointed. I went to go get a manicure only and the employee attempted to convince me several times to get acrylic nails and a pedicure even after telling her that I only needed a manicure. I dont like being pressured into getting something that I dont need and I still gave her a tip.I paid with my debit card and coincidently after I used my card, my bank sent me a notification of suspicious activity on my account, several charges had been made on my debit card that I did not make. The bank is investigating the transactions and deactivated my debit card. I am highly suspicious that these charges were made by Cover Nails, which would be unprofessional and poor business practice. I recommend not to use your debit card there.< /Review>< GmapID>

Cheap but delicious Chinese food. The prices kind of feel too good to be true since they’re so cheap! Best entrees are the BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken, both are so juicy and packed full of flavor!< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE: The Beautiful and loved Joanna and her wonderful husband are BACK IN BUSINESS, and SUPER FRESH! I was absolutely worried and heartbroken when I saw this gem closed during the pandemic. So when I heard it just opened back up on May 16th, I was absolutely excited and relieved to know they were okay.

When I first saw the open sign lit and the door opened, I got so excited. I saw Joanna placing some freshly made orange chicken her hubby had just made into the display. As soon as Joanna saw me, we were both so happy and just ask if we were okay and in good health. I got to see her hubby and he was in good health too. The smiles and love were evident in our conversation.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCsxfUvCVyPfDrSHbn6mUA0HU3So2ZF6QObnq0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLOa5RAQWWwnlJ6-ieyzcTXms7Nv47ZpLe5mtk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><GmapID>0x80c2b8984d5ed28b:0x383ba01ac7ea86fb<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I go to this marvelous  restaurant often  as I love the good mood that is part of this restaurant. The personel is very friendly and qualified. The service is deeply quick. Needless to say, the food they prepare is highly distinguished. I ate there many times and I was always joyful. The cost is modest. I recommend this place to to all.<//text>

Good bang for the buck! If the following were on the same block or Mall. 1. PF Chang's 2. Pick up Stix 3. Panda Express. 4.Chinatown Express  would be last . They better hope that the other 3  don't move on their block no time soon!!!<//Text>

This restaurant is my preferable site.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to this restaurant. when  I I need a special meal, this restaurant comes straightaway to my head. fresh and all sorts of  food and a large list of dishes.courteous team, and agreeable ambience. Not less important, the pay is good. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /Review>

<text>I love how cheap this place is and the waitress was very nice and accommodating. I do wish they had more seating. I tried their Beef Stew Dry Mixed Noodle, Yang Chow Fried Rice, and Garlic Stir Fried Bok Choy. The Beef Stew was my favorite. I really liked the noodle texture and the flavor was AMAZING. The fried rice was a little bland so I added some hot sauce. The Bok Choy was good but too oily for me. Portion sizes are very generous so I got to bring a lot of it back home for my next meal. I added some Hawaiian soy sauce to the fried rice once I got home and it made the rice soo much better. I can't wait to come back to try something else without having to break my wallet.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Inexpensive, greasy spoon joint. But, oh, so, freaking delicious. I do remain puzzled, however, by why places like this don't carry duck sauce for egg rolls.<//Review>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>I really love their Chinese Food, they serve well for the price you pay. I buy my drinks at the Gas station before I come here. The only problem is that is NOT a good place to eat in the afternoon's of Summer (11am to 5pm) as the sun hits the windows hard and there's no AIR CONDITIONER so you feel like your eating good food on a concentration camp in North Korea so I give you 4**** otherwise it's good food for Take Out =)

<text>I waited 30 minutes for the teriyaki chicken when I asked them when will it be done they said another 15 to 20 minutes but they were just being sarcastic because they didn't like me to ask. 30 minutes is a lot to wait next time I will just walk out. The lady server was nice though. The cook was the one being rude.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>as far as Chinese food goes, this place serves some very inexpensive but tasty food.  The orange chicken is the stand out for me and is probably the best in los angeles.  I like it better than panda express.  Pepper steak and pork tri tips are also very very good.   Although they are VERY cheap eats here, the taste is still huge.  Highly recommend for a quick meal.  Portion size is also generous.</Review>< pics>

The staff is really friendly and very helpful. The food is amazing and the portions are just right. If you're in the mood for chinese cuisine and are in the area this place is for you.<//Text>

<Text>I tried this place since it was near my house and I have to say the food was gross. This is probably the worst Chinese food place I've ever eaten from. I would never go back. It was so nasty.</Text>< Pics>

Eatin' the food as i write this. Doesnt taste bad, but is DANGEROUSLY luke warm. I am eating Pork, and If i get sick, i will crusade to get this place investigated . . . . Not cool.  Funny thing is - My girlfriend while I was there made mention how the food looked all "old". I stifled her on the spot. Seems she's more brilliant than i think at times . . . . . .< /Text>

They have open air shows now “Don’t let the pigeon drive the bus!” Excellent script, performance and venue! The place was not crowded at all! I love that they have jokes for kids and adults, so it’s always fun for the whole family.< /review>

This place is nice but don't go see llama llama with your children here. The performance is less than 1 star and very confusing for the children... There were no costumes used during the performance. They used real people with basically Mickey mouse ears accessories.< /text>

I love the show for different reasons.  It's unique and not many other kids are going to have this experience.  It's enlightening.  Me and out family have now enjoyed learning about Greek mythology after seeing a play about Greek Gods.  It's a chance to feel like a kid again while enjoying a show with your family.  Its one of those things where I'm just as excited to see a show as my daughter is.< /text>

Enjoyed an excellent, charming musical production of Pete the Cat. Heartily enjoyed by 4 and 8 yo grandkids, mom and grandma. Small, cozy theatre. Perfect for little ones but fun for grownups as well. BARTable location.< /review>

<text>The shows are great but the freight abd salvage was a much better theater layout for families and small kids who sometimes need to exit hastily.  Since this is a children's theater it is too bad they didn't plan the floorplan better.</text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Possibly the last. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful however I believe the equipment was rented to me in an unsafe condition. Had 24hrs of use on the truck and within the 1st 5 miles of my move I had a tire blowout. Upon checking the tires...BOTH front drive tires had metal showing through. It's no wonder the blowout occurred. Thank God my family and I had not been traveling on the freeway or things could have gone much worse. Nonetheless my trip was delayed and  when I asked for some type of credit or discount for the inconvenience I was told I had to call corporate😥. At least Brisenos Tire in Perris was fast and efficient with the Roadside service. But come on Uhaul/Stax up....really?!<//review></record>

<text>Super easy to rent. I had my girlfriend call the facility as I weld in the middle of nowhere with no service. Jessica helped her out and was very nice and let her know that I could do it online. So thats what I did. What an easy process it was. After I completed the rental agreement online (yup, you can do it all online without having to even speak to anyone) I received a phone call from Jessica welcoming me and my girlfriend and let us know they have provided us with a lock
I was recommended this facility by one of my fellow welders and a mechanic and I totally see why they love this place< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1614625246940, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review, Tj!

<text>I have a very good experience both times I was in the office. The clerk was very informative, took me around the facility, explained the rules. Very polite. When I called to confirm my space, the clerk informed me he was just getting ready to contact me. A space, the size I needed with an outside entry just came up and he wanted to reserve it for me.
That's good customer service.<//text><Response>{'time': 1596651527700, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review, Shirley!

<text>My husband has passed away. The staxup was notified by myself. They still sent several annoying emails to contact them. I don't know what it was but, after friends were being contacted. I had to send my brother-in-law and to talk to them.
His storage was broken into several times. Each time, staxup says they had camera surveillance . there is no cameras . Their never been any in the area where he had his equipment ,motorcycles and boat stolen. They never did anything but when it came to talking to the sheriff They lied about it and told the sheriff a completely different story.
I will never tell anyone this is the place to store your valuables. I will never send anyone there they are dishonest. I want nothing to do with them. Please stop harassing me.<//text>< Response>

<review>Stax up Storge  is a great place to park your toys or put your extra stuff clean  and great helpful people. I left because every year for the last 5 years I was there my bill kept going up and up and up. could not get in the gate past 10 pm. I want 24 hour access I mean it is my stuff I should be able to get to it when I need it right.  If it was not for Those two things it would be a five star Park. Thanks Rosario<//review>< Pics>

Manny, the assistant manager was so professional and helpful.  We got a storage unit and a moving truck.  I hadn't made a reservation for the truck but he made some calls and worked it out for us.  He was friendly and knowledgable of his business.  I would highly recommend  StaxUP in Homeland< /Review>

<Date>1571844269930<//Date><rate>3<//rate><Review>Nice place. Nice people. But I couldn't keep up with price increases way above inflation every year. Approx 30% in 2.5 years. Can't afford it on Disabled veterans income. :-(  I read your response and as I said,  you are very nice people.  I am sure you feel your increases in space rental brought you to a reasonable level.  But I rented there because your rates were lower than others.  I drive from menifee (where there are numerous storage options- for more money of course) to Homeland because I saved money. When I first rented it was 100 dollars +/- . Admittedly less than Menifee.  But you have raised my rates to $128 in just a couple years.  I get a 2% increase if I am lucky in my disability each year. I am an old man.  Your 28 -30 dollar increase is a 30% increase!  I just cannot afford it. If all of your expenses went up 10- 15% a year you would have to find a way to make ends meet too.  Especially if you income only increased by 1.6%.  Best wishes.  Nothing personal. Take care.</Review>< pics>

<review>WARNING TO ALL.. DO NOT PARK YOUR RV OR RENT ANY RENTAL SPACE FROM THIS FACILITY.  WE HAD OUR RV TAKEN FROM THIS LOT IN OCTOBER 2018 AND AS OF TODAY, NEVER HEARD FROM THE COMPANY AGAIN.  WAS PROMISED A CALL BACK AND MY MONEY BACK AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED A DIME.
THIS IS AN INSIDE JOB.  THEY HAVE SHADY PEOPLE WORKING THERE ALLOWING THE THEFTS TO HAPPEN BY TURNING THE OTHER WAY.
I HAVE POSTED ON THIS SITE BEFORE. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WARN PEOPLE AS LONG AS I AM ABLE.  THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS.

I'd like to know if your property was insured. If it was, we can probably help you in some way, but a manager needs to speak with you. Have you spoken directly with a manager?\n\nRegarding police information concerning this event, we contacted the sheriff and were told that, while we were victimized during the incident, because the RV was not ours they can not give us information about it. Have you spoken to the local police about this? If not, would you please do so and let us know if there is anything we can do to help?\n\nWe take these incidents very seriously and we need to work together to make sure they don't happen in the future. Part of that is sharing information. Again, please reach out to me at the above email if you would like to work on this together.\n\nBest,\nPeter"}< /Response>

The staff is usually very helpful as long as there is at least two in the office. You might have to wait a while for help if not. Place is usually clean except by the RV's, stuff tends to pile up out there.  To my knowledge their cameras and gates are working most of the time.  They have an RV / Car Wash there also. They also rent out U-Haul trucks which is convenient.< /text>

<Review>Do not park your RV at this location! Our RV was broken into and also stolen from the lot. After the 1st incident (break in) we determined to pay extra and have it moved to “safe” camera zone area. Regardless of where we parked it, the RV was taken straight from the lot. No one from the StaxUp ever called us to report or confirm it gone. We went to pick it up for a small RV planned vacation and it was GONE!
We have asked for someone to call us back on video footage and all we are told that no one at the storefront has the combination other than the installer to view the cameras, doesn’t make sense!! We are still waiting for camera footage!
If you park your RV at this place know that there cameras only video for 10days and then delete, the VP at the StaxUp could  careless if it’s gone.

I wholeheartedly believe without a doubt that it was taken from their lot by someone they know. This is an inside JOB!
Beware and Park your RV at your own risk!!
I may have just left them KEYS and said take me I’m free!

I am looking at filing charges with the lot for negligence.
Renters do not rent RV space from this facility, they could careless how you feel, Or what was taken!<//Review>< pics>

Noone should ever have to experience theft like this. I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to work with local law enforcement to provide them with everything they need to find the person who did this. I hope the rent that was refunded is a small step toward re-earning your business. Please let me know if you would like to talk about this over email at wecare@stratprop.com.

My wife, Karen, and I have been storing our RV here for over 8 years.  We have been very impressed with Alisha's desire and efforts to make improvements on site.  We know that she inherited some deficient equipment, but hopefully she will get the resources to complete all her "to do" list items.

We have been pleased to recommend StaxUP to several of our friends, and they now are also clients.<//Review>

Her Husband Jimmy has been a wealth of information  and a good friend  since we moved here.

Very pleased with the professionalism at this facility! Alisha introduced herself when I came in with some questions regarding storage and truck rentals. She had all the information at the ready and I was in and out with everything I needed to know. Extremely happy to be treated like a person and not just another sale!</text>

<review>My favorite hookah lounge in Fresno!! The biggest and nicest in my opinion. If you’re looking for a nice friendly hookah spot this is it. The manager makes the best mixed flavors<//review>< gmap_id>

Nice little lounge in Fresno. Nice people, decent hookah, wish they didn't use the re usable hoses, I hate those. Music is cool they mix it up. Sometimes it's a little but on the loud side but usually it's chill.<//text>

Easily the best hookah lounge in town!  The atmosphere was awesome,  the service was quick, but most of all the owner was really friendly, even though we were being really picky about the hookah. They really took care of us. Easily in the top 5 for local hot spots.</Review>

This place hit the spot. New manager Zizi was the best host. I did not try the food but 3 others in my party did & loved it! Zizi made sure our hookah was going smooth the whole time. Will be back next time i am in fresno & will definitely gourge on the food as well.</Text>

Wanted curtain tiebacks from Anthropologie but wasn't willing to spend $50+ for the pair. So I got everything to make something similar for less than $20 at Michael's!< /text>

Good Sales going on, had fairly long line going in, and of course for the register.  My issue is with other customers who wait until they get to the register to finish shopping?  With only 2 registers open, a Woman with 2 small boys leaves register to get packing tape, cashier waiting for her return, but woman then asks for someone to retrieve ornament hangers.  They can not, so she leaves again to go in search for them. Meanwhile the other register with a man and woman checking out separately have a basket style box without it's price tag.  So now both registers are in holding pattern waiting for customers...finally got out of store but frustrating.<//Text>

You can never find an employee to help you and if you do find an employee they don't know where stuff is 🤔 I also feel Michael's is somewhat overpriced</Review>

This Michael's has a wonderful employee named Patty. Very personal and helpful. I hope the manager's realize this. This was the second time we have been in this store. A very well stocked store.<//Review>

We always find some wonderful craft to do. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The store is a little on the empty side just a sign of the times.</Review>

<Text>Store is great always organized and clean. They almost always have exactly what I need and a couple things I didn't know I did. I thought prices were a bit high on things comparatively to other stores. But I realized they always have awesome coupons you can pull up on phone in line and it all becomes a much better price. Definitely check website before checkout.< /Text>< Pictures>

A good selection of craft supplies, if not a little expensive. I found the materials I was looking for here (craft glue and paint brushes), and when there are sales it can definitely be a great place to go. You can also call them to ask if they have what you are looking for.</Review>

The Napa Michael's is a small store and it always falls short of whatever I need. I rarely go there and when I do I just won't up frustrated that I wasted my time there instead of just heading out of town to a real Michael's.<//Text>

This is a fairly small store as far as Michaels goes, but there's a decent selection of the basics. I do a lot of cross stitch, so I can speak to their large and regularly restocked supply of DMC thread, but you'll have to look elsewhere if you're hoping for oval or fancy hoops.</Text>

<Review>Finally a Michaels in Napa, I thought I would be super ecstatic, I mean, don't get me wrong I am SUPER happy there's one here, but it's a bit small.  No complaints here as I've found mostly everything I needed when I needed something.  Always in stock for the most part.  Tried out one of their classes not too long ago.  It was okay, however it wasn't the subject at hand and totally did something different.  All in all, happy place. ☺< /Review>< Rate>

The customer service here is seriously lacking. The cashiers have little to no knowledge of crafting and should you asked for an item, they will usually tell you that they don't have it instead of actually looking for said item. Very frustrating!</review>

<review>It was an okay experience...traveled for work.
My first room was over the pool and the bed was vibrating from the filtration system...which like, cool if that's you're thing but it's not mine. They moved me rooms but I had to sleep in a queen instead of the king I had booked.
One of the female front desk staff was pretty rude for seemingly no reason, which was kinda a bummer.
But, it was clean and relatively comfortable so...fine I guess.<//review>< Pics>

It’s a fun, quiet and calm place...
Very clean, there is more than one playground and the ducks are very friendly!!
But most of the people there weren’t wearing a facemask :(< /Text>

Haven't been to Waller Park for years. We had such an enjoyable experience the ducks and geese are exceptionally friendly. We had an opportunity to feed them, but they didn't care for the  veggies that we brought for them. It might be a good idea to take some duck food with you. A very enjoyable afternoon.< /review>

<review>This park is the best in Santa Maria! There are fun activities like disc golf, dog parks, volleyball courts, basketball courts and play areas for kids of all sizes. You can reserve picnic areas that have BBQ pits or feed the ducks if you like. Walking in the park is another soothing activity that you will enjoy.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This is a really large well taken care of park. Lots of activities for everyone (several playgrounds, basketball, baseball, hiking, soccer, disc golf, dog park).

There are some ponds including a duck pond with an island where a monkey apparently used to live.

Tons of picnic tables and covered areas. BBQ’s and more!</review>

Waller park has a great 27 hole disc golf course. The park is huge with multiple entrances and sections with all of the different park activities you expect and more. The disc golf course is over 3 miles long with multiple basket positions at each hole. We met 97 year old Don on the course, it was inspiring playing with him, he started at 92 and is really good. This park has everything you could want in a park. If this was helpful please give me a like.</Review>

<Name>Tim Jensen<//Name><text>This is a really large well taken care of park. Lots of activities for everyone (several playgrounds, basketball, baseball, hiking, soccer, disc golf, dog park).

There are some ponds including a duck pond with an island where a monkey apparently used to live.

Tons of picnic tables and covered areas. BBQ’s and more!<//text><date>1614458945706</date>< response>

<review>This is a county park as is very well maintained. The dog park is really nice. Not alot of places to sit in side the fence.
The pond area is full of activities, from the ducks,geese, squirrel, and kids having fun.
On the weekend they have pony rides. You can play disc golf here also. It's  over all a great place to spend a little time unplugged and enjoying the trees and nature.< /review><user_id>116270603873076479905< /user_id><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZ5lwAsvkxpS6UsziERv6ntwV4eeah-W0Ij7jc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEpp6ATM6Gq-ZW-xIK71jXJ8UYomanBWiumPW_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< date>

Been coming here since literally the 80's but back then I was a baby, love it. Always love coming here. If you have kids they have a good number a playgrounds, ducks, and even pony rides on sunday (the pony rides are a classic staple to this place) For parents right now during this time of covid your best chances to come and bring your kids would be midday during the week there are kids but low volume. Also an excellent place to come Frisbee golf with your boys. Do recommend<//Text>

Been coming here since literally the 80's but back then I was a baby, love it. Always love coming here. If you have kids they have a good number a playgrounds, ducks, and even pony rides on sunday (the pony rides are a classic staple to this place) For parents right now during this time of covid your best chances to come and bring your kids would be midday during the week there are kids but low volume. Also an excellent place to come Frisbee golf with your boys. Do recommend< /Review>

Honestly the Rona restrictions are having a positive impact on the park. Most people are keeping to themselves so that's a huge improvement with crowds. Beautiful scenery, clean ponds and wildlife to watch. Waller Park is much larger than it appears at first glance also. There are plenty of locations to park.< /Text>

This park is awesome, but where are the park rangers? Where is the care taker that lives in RV near the mini pony ride?< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Waller Park is very pretty and a fun place to take our toddler to feed the ducks and play on the playground.  There is close in parking available near the ponds or by the main playground.  I see lots of nice families there having a good time.  There is also a pony riding corral on the weekends and plenty of picnic tables around the park to get away from the crowds.  This is a nice park to spend a few hours at.< /text>< Pictures>

One of the best free parks you'll find anywhere in a city. Varied topography, one of the best disc golf courses around, a top rated dog park with a new dog washing station, duck pond, turtles, pony rides for kids on weekends, a couple of miles of walking, volleyball, group site rentals, and more!</text>

<Review>Great park! Needs some better enforcement of not feeding the wildlife (there are signs but everyone ignores them). We saw a dozen people feeding bread to the geese, squirrels and ducks. It's bad for the animals and it makes every bench and sidewalk nearby bench be covered in bird droppings.<//Review>< pictures>

The park is nice, the grounds men keep the lawn trimmed, my 🐕 has only been bitten once there (by a little 🐕 no less) and people do not always pick up their 🐕 business. But I really like that my 🐕 likes it there. I keep coming back.< /review>

It's a pretty park. Peaceful, nice large trees, big open bbq areas tucked away for privacy. I've been going to this park for over 25 years now.  It still is extremely clean and we'll taken care of.  Hope it stays that way!< /review>

It's big, lots of space, parking and nice features like two ponds.
Seems like a good place to let kids run around.
There's also a fenced-in dog area to allow off leash time.
However, it seems a bit run down as in it could use some maintenance but overall it's a pretty cool spot to spend an afternoon!<//Text>

The park is beautiful, much larger than expected.  They DO NOT have enough restrooms.  I recently attended a Memorial Service there.  I was surprised at the size of the park & all the great children's areas.  Not enough RESTROOMS.<//Text>

<Text>The park itself is beautiful. It has plenty of room for BBQs then it has the duck pond which is very nice to watch, its also a perfect place for a good run and it has a great dog area. I just wish the city had a strict rule as far as feeding and protecting the ducks. I constantly see kids and teens (with their parents aside) kicking and pulling on the ducks and they think its funny, while the parents just watch. The park rangers are there for looks because many times they are around and i have yet to see any of them approach any of these kids or parents. Not to mention families bring human food and feed it to the ducks.</Text>< pictures>

<text>A really nice park with two ponds, a small river, ducks and geese. It feels more like a forest than a park, overall a really nice place for a picnic. Very large park and has 2 playgrounds! Plenty of squirels here also</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

We had a great weekend in Santa Maria and decided to come visit this park during a softball tournament. Fantastic time with the family. We will be coming back year after year. It was clean and everybody was friendly. And there is the dog park.</Review>

A pretty amazing park. Good playgrounds for the kids, great cookout amenities, lots of open grass with plenty of shade trees. Aggressive geese are the major detection and not much at that.</review>

Waller Park is one of the most beautiful and very well maintained park we have ever visited! We are from Bakersfield and come to Santa Maria several times a year and  for a mini vacation and take our morning walks always at Waller park! Love it! Keep up the good work!<//Review>

<Review>We drove through just to check the park out for the first time after driving by this big park repeatedly. It looks very clean and well kept by the city. Many playgrounds, park benches and water features such as fountains and ponds. Lots of ducks and geese. While driving out we even spyed a ultimate frisbee course with goals set up throughout the entrance of the park. Very cool. Coming back to picnic soon.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Everytime I go to the YMCA I am asked to rate Waller Park (the two are close). That being said there is SO much to do there. Playground equipment for kids, ducks, BBQs and picnic tables, horse shoe pits, an exercise course, wide open grass for playing ball and beautiful pine trees. It really is a top notch park.< /Review><gmapID>0x80ec14a8ba651539:0x746861b3c6f43020</gmapID>< name>

<text>This park is amazing! My dog loves having so much space to run and play!

One side note: some people bring their dogs here and don't understand the way that dogs play. A woman threatened to hit my young dog with her chuckit stick just because he was vocal and trying to play with her dog! Many of us felt our dogs were unsafe with her in the park and chose to leave instead of letting her abuse our pups. The park is great, but the people are a total crapshoot!<//text>< Resp>

Great park to walk, bike ride and other outdoor activities including bringing your dog. Also a great place to get some fresh air and it is located in the city. The park gets a little bit busy during the weekend with parties.< /Review>

It was a lovely venue, but I have one criticism. When the bride got there, there was no place for that car to park to let the bridal party out so they could easily make it to the gazebo. Suggestion: offer a parking barrier that says "Wedding Party" that would straddle the two northernmost gazebo parking spaces and have it available to the wedding family so that it is only used on days when there are weddings in the gazebo - thanks!</Review>< pictures>

<text>This park has helped me create many memorable moments. The ducks, geese, a  multitude of different birds have bred with a variety of birds creating a mix of over a dozen of different types of ducks, geese and other birds are SO unique and native ONLY to Waller Park. (Imbreeding HAS led to some vicious geese & some of the birds have been known to approach and nip/bite park-goers who fed or would feed them. Thankfully there is a NEW rule, NO FEEDING THE BIRDS. The park has repaired the pond fountains and refilled them. There's tons of community activities here, and now that it's being maintained better than EVER, it's a GREAT place to have outdoor parties or events. A nice family park, huge, with MULTIPLE bathrooms and playgrounds. A dog park and more. It's a beautiful area to spend some time just laying around.< /text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

Love this park! Whether it be to come feed the ducks or the squirrels or maybe just enjoy one of the many playgrounds, not to mention the dog park. Anything you want to do Waller Park is the best place. BBQ, walk, exercise, play, feed the animals, exercise your dog, sightseeing love it.</text>

It has horse rides for children. Fresbee course that’s a great challenge for teens. I absolutely love the barbecue areas. Many happy memories there.<//Review>< Rating>

The best disc golf around! The dog park is nice and has a small and large dog area.
A great place to feed ducks with your kids, fly a kite, ride a bike, bbq or even have your kids ride a pony!! Did I mention the disc golf course is awesome? ...Well it is!!< /Review>

A nice place for a walk! Landscape is great! Not a quiet place by any means. It's really loud and there is a party every time I go there. But if you don't mind a ton of noise, it pretty nice!< /review>

Love this park, makes for great memories, parties or just spontaneous family gatherings! Always been in love with the ducks and the entire duck pond I ended up raising one myself, sad that people choose to feed them bread I miss the duck food dispensers! also a great place to bring your dogs, cats whatever emotionally supportive being you may have because there's plenty of green grass and outdoor dining tables, (unless its raining) The playground is completely different but bigger and unfortunately the Ponies and horses arent there anymore that I am aware of, but man if you ever experienced the classic Waller park memories; coming back to this place brings them right back if you ever take a walk down the trails to the very end of the park! Plenty of frisbee areas to choose from!💞 also please dont be rude to the animals there and dont be a gross litterbug💜< /text>

It's a great park, it's just that people dont listen and over feed the ducks. Therefore, at the end of the day the water looks very green, almost turning yellow because of the poop< /Review>

<Review>Waller Park is just an all around family park with picknic areas, about 3 main playgrounds for the kids, plenty of bathrooms, pets are welcomed, I've even seen people bring horses! It's a perfect place for birthday parties, family gatherings and special events. Not to mention the duck pond! And huge water ⛲ fountain that it feeds into. Oh and on Sundays there is a pony corral where for like &1.00 a child or teen can ride a pony or horse! Plus there are squirrels you will come across as you walk through the entire park. And for all you Disk Golf fans, this is thee best local park to play and meet local semi-pro to pro discgolfers. 👍🏽< /Review><Date>1561654071675< /Date><user>108166694764675849292</user><username>Queen D< /username>< Rate>

I like this place because of the dog park inside called Woof Park. They have a small dog side and a large dog side. You can let your dog roam about off leash. The coolest thing is the wide open area your dog can just run in. No need to bring water they got a water fountain for dogs. They also got benches for you to sit on. The people down here are super nice!</text>

Waller Park is a very well taken care of park with a dog run, many ducks and different kinds if animals also and a friendly amount of squirrels. There's much to explore with many children's playgrounds and a small pond to see the ducks and geese swim. This is a very nice place to take pictures of plants and animals. The parks here are widely used and the dog run always has many dogs included inside. The park is a high rated park due to the fact that it is taken very well care of. The one downside to the park is that the majority of people here are not very friendly and so it is best to bring your own animal and/or family member so you have a better time and maybe there is a chance you might meet someone new, but they seem to be very antisocial.< /review>

I've been to weddings, baby showers, birthdays, BBQs, reunions, company picnics, you name it. Always a great park well maintained by our lovely county. As far as I know alcohol is not prohibited, bringing your own pits to BBQ is prohibited. Also make sure u call ahead to make a reservation or find out if the spot you want is reserved being evacuated and moved to a another place is a real bummer.< /review>

<review>Great place to get away for the day.  Nice little walking trails through the trees, a dog park with separate areas for small and large dogs.  Good playground equipment for kids,  especially the spinning thingy! ! Bring duck food for the ducks and geese. Fishing is available in the small pond, though I'm not sure on licensing. (Check before you go). Many bbq pits available. Great for intimate, small or large parties.</review>< username>

Frisbee golf course, group areas, BBQ pits and stands, off leash Woof Pack dog park, decent bathrooms, ample parking. There's even a duck pond! Speed bumps are plentiful and annoying. Overall, this is a great park.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

My daughter makes it a point to rent an area here for special events &  to this date we have not been disappointed because the areas are greatly equipped.  From potatoe sack races to sports,  we did it all and had the most amazing day and created wonderful memories. Five star rating?  Definitely!< /Review>

Waller Park , also known as "parke de las ardillas" , is the best park in my opinion. There are a few ponds with plenty of seating around. Lots and lots of squirrels everywhere. There are many hills for kids to run up and roll down. A really nice playground is also available for the little ones. And finally there are plenty of BBQ locations that can be reserved if you contact the people that manage them. Great place to unwind!<//review>

Daughters first birthday and had to used one of they're "listed" bounce house vendors only to get no response from three on the list after repaeated efforts ending up with the forth who would have been great if there wasn't broken glass inside the bounce house... waller park needs to change that vendor list to better quality vendors but other than that the location was good, exactly what it said it was and spacious party turned put good even with a horrible list of bounce house vendors< /Review>

This place features prominently in my childhood memories. It is a very large park and I have attended my fair share of birthday parties and soccer games here. Lots of barbecue facilities that are first come first serve and the park also features a large disc golf course which can be fun with friends. Several vendors sell shaved ice and other treats but there are no real restaurants here.< /review>

A place of Zen for me here in Santa Maria. Playing disc golf there at the 27 hole course allows you to view the entire Park and its lush green well-kept grass Tall Pines and a feeling of contentment.</text>

Good disc golf but very crowded.  I had to skip several holes where little kids were playing on the basket or where there was a family having a picnic right in the danger zone.< /Text>

It's a big park with a bunch of smaller parks in it. They have duck pond area, a good sized dog park area, couple different play grounds, and it's always clean and well maintained.< /Review>

I love this park it's one of my favorites of all parks. It has many places for kids to run, it has ponies for the kids to ride, it has a dog park where people can bring their dogs to play and it also has ducks to feed.< /text>

36 Holes of Frisbee Golf, green grass, water fountains and BBQ pits, a really nice Dog park, and clean bathrooms, Waller Park is one of those places you take for granted until you move away. Nothing like a nice day in the park.< /text>

(Translated by Google) This park is so big, that it has areas to reserve, you can enjoy the games for children, its green areas, its lagoon for ducks and geese, that roam freely without fear of people, lots of trees, their space for pets, where they can run freely because that area is fenced, it is worth visiting.

(Original)
Este parque es tan grande, que tiene areas para reservar, puedes disfrutar de los juegos para niños, sus áreas verdes, su laguna para los patos y gansos, que deambulan libremente sin miedo a la gente, gran cantidad de árboles, su espacio para las mascotas, donde pueden correr libremente porque esa área se encuentra cercada, vale la pena visitarlo..</review>

(Translated by Google) This park is so big, that it has areas to reserve, you can enjoy the games for children, its green areas, its lagoon for ducks and geese, that roam freely without fear of people, lots of trees, their space for pets, where they can run freely because that area is fenced, it is worth visiting.

(Original)
Este parque es tan grande, que tiene areas para reservar, puedes disfrutar de los juegos para niños, sus áreas verdes, su laguna para los patos y gansos, que deambulan libremente sin miedo a la gente, gran cantidad de árboles, su espacio para las mascotas, donde pueden correr libremente porque esa área se encuentra cercada, vale la pena visitarlo..< /text>
