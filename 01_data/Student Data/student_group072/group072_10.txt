Fast, affordable and great communication. I had a nail in my tire and after he reviewed the condition of the tire he just recommended to just replace it with a used one. For a few bucks more I walked out with a better condition tire and in my mind a safer one as well. Thank you "Hernandez tire shop" for being honest and efficient.</text>

This place is the Biggest SCAM tire shop in the area. My strongly advice for the people which are taking in consideration to stop by to The  Hernandez 'theft' tires shop is do Don't make the same mistake I already did.
Their "new" replaced tire screwed my car direction and when I came back the 'gypsy' behavior owner woman from the office got mad because I insisted to change this bomb tire and she physically pushed me outside of the shop area if you can believe how I was treated.
I had to stop by on the shoulder of the roar and chance myself this bad tire with the spare wheel because I was unable to drive the car above 60 miles per hour on freeway, the car was literally shacking especially the steering wheel and my car direction was going on the right side so I had to constantly straighten the car in the right direction, to go straight ahead.
They refuse to balance the tire (because they know the tire may be bad, so he customer will not gonna be able to see that) after they install the new tire on the pretext that a new tire does not need balance because it is new, although I insisted, my request was completely denied and I mention again the latino woman physically pushed me outside of the shop area and told me to move on.<//text>

<text>Not the right tire size for 60 bucks. I've had better service at other places

Update: I included photos. Not only did this man charge me 60 bucks for the wrong tire but it went flat on me in 2 DAYS!!! While I was there he said a new tire would cost me $120! This is a dishonest business. I'm guessing that the flat tire I brought him was repairable and he just took my tire and replaced it with something that was going to fail. Now I'm at another place getting my tire repaired. Do not trust them!< /text>< time>

<Review>Bad service, bad attitude.  Stay away from Hernandez Tire Shop. I went there to have my front tires mounted and balance, the same day the balance weights fell off. I went back to have them redo the job, the short little guy doing the work had an attitude with me and started banging on my wheel. I immediately stopped him and had him put my wheel back on without completing the work. I asked for a refund and did not get it. I will never go back there again. Also, I did not give them permission to post a photo of my Black 1965 Chevelle on their website. Please remove it immediately.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

My personal experience has been very positive.  I thought the price was good, the service was great, and workmanship was spot on. Hard working family, deserving of your consideration if you tires. Will definitely return for business.</Text>

Please beware, this is not a trustworthy business. A dear friend of mine was absolutely ripped off here. They replaced his flat with a used tire that was the WRONG SIZE. That is directly endangering the driver! Not only this but that tire went flat almost immediately! Do not do business with this company, as it seems they enjoy scamming folks out of their money.< /review>

Awful experience here. I had a flat tire that they said was un-repairable, charged me $60 for a used tire that was the wrong size and in 2 DAYS that tire he sold me went flat. I will never come here again and tell everyone I know to avoid this place. Times are hard and you really have to be heartless to cheat people out of the little money they have.</text>

Good thing I caught it before my suv started dropping, which could have left the jack punching through.
I had to explain to the guy that it wasn't the pinch weld that he was jacking up.
I had to show him where to place the Jack.  Terrible!!!<//Review></record>

Needed just one tire since I had one bald tires as a result of an alignment issue. Called in and they had a few used ones for my size. $41 with install, so cheap! Literally was in and out in 10 minutes. They were super nice and I chatted with the owner for a bit about her time in Utah. Couldn't recommend more! Seriously, that was SO fast.</Text>

<text>I was in an emergency situation with a flat tire.  I called for a quote for two new tires.  They told me $40 each out the door.  I didn't even call around since I payed $43 a tire last time I got new tires.  I got there via police (unfriendly escort) . They started to put on two new tires then told me $240 . I told them they quoted me $40 each.  They said that's for used tires.  Rip off. I just replaced the flat tire because I was riding on the wheel and the police cruiser was parked behind me.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Name>Mike Barnes<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Was quoted $35-40 for a used tire with installation. I was specific about the tire type and truck. ($40 is the average price at all other used tire shops as well). But upon arrival they refused to install the tire for any less than $60, simply saying "sorry that's the price". Classic bait and switch occurring here, stay away.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Unfortunately, I've been here twice in the past two weeks.   Picked up a screw in one tire, then a week later, a metal shard in another.
Both repairs were done quickly, todays repair took about 3 minutes.  And at HALF the price of Pep Boys.  He's going to get my tire business from now on.< /review>

I'm new to the Upland area and due to the droving I have to do for my job I need a dependable tire shop. Well I went to a tire shop on grove and their customer service is atrocious and i waitedfoe over 30 mins to gix a nail in my tire. I ended up leaving and found this place. This place is my new tire shop. They have a faithful customer now! Very quick service, great customer service and reasonable prices. I will be returning.<//Text>

Don't expect special orders at this McDonald's!! You ask for extra something & will be told no, they will give you a packet on the side....its insane!! Never heard of this at any location except this one!!<//Review>

Not all McDonald’s are the same: this one is better than all of the rest. Perfectly cooked filet-o-fish. Nicely seasoned crispy fries. A quarter pounder that doesn’t give you stomach problems. To top all this off, the people serving you were some of the friendliest workers I’ve ever encountered at a fast food place. I highly recommend coming here!!<//text>

Just wanted a sandwich, on the way to a movie. I'm not much of a fan of fast food, but this is open all night & so close to home. Nothing new to report...it's a good McDonald's. Quick, clean, hassle-free.</Text>

<text>I agree with most of the other reviews about rude and bad service. Staff is rude and not helpful. Managers are the worse. Their stingyness know no limit. The look on their face when they have to give complimentary sauce or free cup for water. 😑Never smiling. Always lying about free deals and free small soda with mobile order. I literally went to another McDonald’s same day to check and they gave me free soda with mobile order. Gave this store multiple tries but always the same bad vibe. 👎❌Avoid at all cost. 🚷< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c29e6437da2abb:0xc1973f0299c47422<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Southward-facing patio is clean and sunny and perfect for a little coffee and a nap after a hard morning trail running or cycling. Service is excellent. Food is great. Recently refurbished. Good location. Well appointed interior. You can order from a kiosk within the restaurant if you want. Certainly there were no lines in evidence while I was there. Excellent. 5 Stars.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

<text>I order some food, only got half. Then after calling the restaurant 4 times got nothing but a voicemail. Furthermore I tried to get a refund or the rest of my food and they said they couldn't do that without a receipt. The lady told me it was in the bag yet it is nowhere to be found. I know this is fast food but come on I'm fed up. Literally not physically -_-< /text>< pictures>

This location is by far the most unprofessional Mc Donald's I have ever experienced. I have been coming here for months now. Almost every single time, something is wrong with my order. I sick of it. Ask a simple question and you will almost always get a bad attitude. Get ready to wait, chances are that even for a burger and fries they will make you leave the line and wait in the parking lot for your food. I have NEVER waited less than 10 minutes, even when there is no one else in line. This location needs some serious work.</Review>

<text>This is a good looking fast food restaurant however the cashiers do not pay attention or seem lost when taking a bigger order.

The order taker insisted I use the self order computer because I was using a credit card and would only take my order with cash!  She showed me how to use it and it was taking so long (still no one waiting to order at the counter) I got irritated. She finally agreed to take my order. If this is how they run this location I won't be back.< /text>

I wish I could eat Mickey D's every day. Breakfast lunch and dinner. Like I want to eat it every day until I have clogged arteries and diabetes and have to scream at my wife to come help me up off the sofa. But I don't, cuz I know thats bad for you. Seriously don't eat it every day. But man when its time to finally cheat and have a delicious McChicken and a medium fry this is the place.<//Text>

<Review>The service was the worst.
One of the workers was very unrespectful when we asked why the whole McDonald's was so cold
Asking for they to turn on the heater .
And they replied that they can't do it that is automatically
That is called thermostat not working
Fix it and learn how to talk respectfully to customers</Review><username>Marco Reyes<//username>< rating>

Do not like the new decor. Cashier was nice, friendly. The management looked miserable. Took about 11 minutes to get our order. The sweet tea is my favorite McDonald's item and that was terrible! Taste like sugar water with a bitter aftertaste. Thank you< /text>

<Text>They close at random times at night even though it says 24 hours. They’ve gotten my order wrong at least 3 times one time ordered a quarter pounder, got home opened the bag and was a fish filet... like come on. Sometimes the food is fine but it’s just not a reliable McDonald’s. Just go to the one off las virgenes or topanga. This Woodland Hills one just needs some work.<//Text>< Pics>

Horrible I went to get food after a late movie . First the manager tried to shot change me of six dollars. After I brought it to his attention he never apologized and appeared to be upset that I confronted him and I ask for a decafgonayed drink and he said all he had was ice tea and it was not tea but a coffee / tea mixed . The food was horrible including the fries which are always delicious. I coul not eat the food and definitely watch you change< /Text>

Nobody answered my call
6 call.....phone ring 20/30 each time
Nobody repeat nobody answered there's not exudes for that!!!!
This is to be a worst service ever
I have the similar problems at the McDonald's in las virgines road
And I never went back
I will give a chance to this one more time but after one more problem
I'm done with McDonald's
Rather get a fresh sandwich at Ralph</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

After going for years of not patronizing McDonald's this is the first one that went back into. The reason? McDonald's fired that idiot that refused to serve a cop. McDonald's has my business once again.< /Text>

<rating>2<//rating><text>This place ALWAYS has poorly trained employees. There must be something going on with management because every time we come here the employees seem to be in training.  They don't know how to operate the registers; food takes much longer than normal; and often the food seems to be prepared differently than other McDonalds.
I inky cone here when I need food and forgot to stop at the other McDonalds on the way to the freeway.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Yes. It's McDonald's and expectations should be low. This location doesn't meet the minimum one could reasonably have. The tables are dirty, the service is rude, and something is always broken. Some days they can't take credit cards, sometimes it's the ice maker and today . . . no ice cream based items. No shakes, cones etc. It's always something.</text>< rating>

I ordered a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle and they got my order wrong with sausage instead. I asked to have them fixed it so they used the same one and just switched it with a new slice of cheese. That in itself is a health code violation.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Lousy services we were looking at stops there not even a good morning or even give us up and we were going to attend this way it was today at 7:45 in the morning we had to leave without what we were going to order because nobody gave us services but neither manager who are the ones who have to be the example for the people who are under their charge

(Original)
Pésimo servicios nos miraban allí paradas ni un buenos dias ni si quiera nos desian ya las bamos atender así fue el día de hoy a las 7:45 dela mañana tuvimos que irnos sin lo q ivamos a ordenar por que nadie nos prestó servicios pero ni la manager q son los que tienen que ser el ejemplo para la jente q esta bajo su cargo</review>

This place is super fun and has lots of character! There’s really a community that loves this bike shop, everyone rings their bells when they fly by on their bikes! Pete was super cool! Fixed my bike same day (even during covid). I thought I just needed new handle bar tape but he actually redid the whole thing and now it’s super fun and pink (he said it’s rad)! everyone always compliments me. He even diagnosed an issue that I didn’t know I had. Hills have always been soooo brutal for me, but Pete changed out my cassette for a new one (w/ more teeth), so it’s waaaay easier to go up hills now ☺️ He even introduced me to some chic bike fashion - cafe du cycliste. He also straightened out my handle bar (I fell somewhere back in the day and had been riding with a crooked left bar..) I think they may have lost my little rear bike light connecter thing, but the owner offered to buy me a new one. All in all, a very friendly family vibe 🙂 that you can’t really get at your run of the mill bike shop!!< /review>

<Text>April 1997: So, this review is a little belated, but look past that for a moment. Was cleaning out a closet at the house my parents lived in since 1982. Dad passed a few years ago and mom is downsizing. . . Excavating through the closet, I found a water bottle tucked in a far back corner from a trip to Sausalito back in. . . Yep. 1997. Instantly transported back in time. My wicked smaht wife and I were in SF for a chemistry conference and took the ferry over to Sausalito. Bikes. That's what we needed. That's what we found. At the time, great bikes that were well-maintained took us through the back neighborhoods and along the paths along the bay past sport complexes, wooded areas, and a happy horse or two along the way. We had a great time together. You're not renting a bike. You're renting a human-powered memory machine. Besides, nothing makes snacks at the nearby restaurant taste better than a little local-area, two-wheeled exploration.<//Text>< pictures>

If you are passionate about cycling, a visit to this shop should be on your bucket list. Tony is a true steward of the sport, and its history. You will be hard pressed to find someone more passionate, knowledgeable, and best of all, humble. His energy has attracted some of the best in the community to work full time (e.g Peter), and even has former employees and current customers helping out in a bind. Stop by to check out vintage steel frames, or buy some of the latest tech on the market. I personally went with a retro, but I’ve never been happier with a bicycle in my life. Many thanks, guys!</Text>

Tony runs the best bike shop in the SF/BA.

I’ve been riding and racing throughout the area for over 25 years. ABO became my go-to shop after stopping in nearly every other one over the years. I’ve watched most others become less of a ‘hometown’ shop and more of a ‘business’ as they changed from being there for a client to selling product to meet sales goals.

Tony’s shop has always put clients first, profits second. It’s been tough on them but they’ve created a deeply loyal following and for good reason.

Excellent assistance with flat tire repair.  I went to two other shops before finding Tony who had the repair kit in stock.   He even let me use some tools.  Thx<//Text>

I needed to upgrade the cantilever brakes on to x brakes on a touring bike.  One of the staff - whose name I sadly didn’t get - helped me select a set that was reasonably good but not extraordinarily expensive. He also provided great advice for new cable housing, cables, and other accoutrements, as well as some ‘not-in-the-package’ descriptions of installing and adjusting them.  And they did this despite the fact that my bike was laden with panniers and other kit and neither it nor I were impressive-looking.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Took my bike in for a fix on a sheared derailleur hangar. Tony said he could get it fixed no problem. Total time was quicker than 4 or 5 other estimates I got. I ended up speaking with Matt and Jeremy, too. Top notch quality and professionalism. I ended buying a pair of shoes when I picked up the bike.

The shop has been around for awhile. Check out the website. They have a great story. A ton of cool retro bikes in that shop. Great stuff

Highly recommend.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<text>This is a great and pretty inexpensive place to rent a bike.  The owner, Tony, was very helpful in selecting bike paths.
Unfortunately, we had an accident where my mother, Beth, fell while biking.  So, when we arrived to his shop, he actually helped clean her up. On top of that, he didn't even charge her for the rental.  So, this bike rental place gets five stars from me.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I have been even more impressed with A Bicycle Odyssey since I actually got the bike home! Tony made sure that the bike fit me, swapped out disc brakes, derailleur, and tires... Whatever it took to make me happy and more importantly ensure that I was going to have a great riding experience. Not only did they treat me like a "gold" customer, but also I saw them treating EVERYONE like that (and I am very observant to how a business interacts with their customers). Now I absolutely love my Colnago. Fits me perfect, looks great and I've been able to customize it (with their help) to be what I want (instead of "off the rack”). I've been cycling for nearly 30 years in San Francisco and Marin... I never received the level of service from anywhere else that I have with A Bicycle Odyssey.  Believe me, the experience and expertise you will get with this staff is worth the ride over the bridge.

Thanks again for the job well done!

These guys are the right people to take your bike to in Sausalito if you need a good, quick repair. They will treat you fairly and honestly with service. I haven't bought anything else there so don't have much to say about frames, price, ect, but they know bikes and will get yours back on the road for a fair price.< /Text>

<Review>I will definitely not purchase from this shop. I was looking to purchase a new race bike. I called to see if they had bikes for test ride in stock. I told them the models/sizes I was looking to buy and the person I talked to on the phone verified that they had them there ready test ride. After I drove an hour to the shop, I discovered that they did not have bikes in stock. The one that they did have in stock was not ready to ride because parts had been scavenged from it. What an absolute waste of time.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>I went to get a flat tire fixed on my road bike, the guy even cleaned my chain a little for free, but as with most bike shops, it was $20 total, and I got a pinch flat ten miles later into that ride, because the tube had been put in slightly twisted, and on top of that, the lockring wasn't replaced on the tube, and neither was the valve cap.  The people were friendly there, but that was about the only benefit.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Tony has own this bike shop (since he was 19 years old, that was 1975! )for a long time. He is known for high end road bike but if you have problem with your bike bring it in and he and his staff will be more then happy to help. You might even see Robin William there, after all he is a "bike nut" who live in San Francisco just south of here.</Review>

Very bad customer service. I went in the store at 7pm  today and the girl wasn't so pleasant with her job or willing to help us. She said there wasn't ANY deals for existing customers. I was trying to do an upgrade, but I had to be a NEW customer from a different phone company in order to get a good phone deal. Mind you, my Phone is paid off already. Willing to change phone company's at the moment.< /review>

The T-Mobile representative sold me a great plan and solutions, nothing compared with what I'm receiving now as a Customer ( I should stay with Verizon )
Customer service at T-Mobile is waste of Time.<//Text>

Horrible customer service, this store does not provide any sort of friendliness at all. In fact Alexis was the one helping my brother, he gave so much attitude. We came to get my brother's social updated and he gave us attitude that he couldn't do any changes, but provide a memo. What I don't understand is why the stupid attitude? It's not like we gave him attitude for not being able to make the update for my brother and   he was asked to cancel the insurance and his response was I already cancelled it, which was impossible because it was my brother's first time asking him to do so. I strongly recommend to avoid getting helped by this employee (Alexis).</text>

They dont have a way of taking customers it gets busy and wondering who came in after who, they should have a self log in tablet at the entrance with a TV with each customers names to know whos ahead of who, c'mon John Legere!!! And maybe a self serve machine to pay bills like Verizon does ... Instead of waiting for the 3 employees that are busy adding 10 lines -__-<//review>

< review>
11/06/2015 @around 5:00pm - Went in to get my termination fee set up since switching from Verizon to tmobile, nothing against the phone service but the guy who "helped us" wasn't even helpful. I asked if he can  help us with the termination fee reimbursement and he just gave me a piece of paper and said I have to do it bc they can't. Funny how I went to the T-Mobile at stonewood mall and we were pleasantly helped with everything. Yeah, maybe this guy should either get trained well or not work there at all.</review>

At first all was great customer service when upgrading to my Galaxy S7 I bought a screen protector (shatter glass) so I thought so when my kid accidently dropped my phone and it broke took off my protector I them realized the rep who helped sold me something completely different just to make a sale went back with receipt and noone in store could explain nor did they accommodate me. I will stick to T-Mobile in ELA on Whittier Blvd all reps have 100 on customer service.<//review>

(Translated by Google) If I could give 0 lo dava Denis, an employee there has a super ugly attitude, she talks to one like who is fighting, the customer service is super horrible, omg love me so much to annoy me, super shocking and the worst thing that the company does not do anything, they do not care. And if some need the service but without the clients they are nothing and this ridiculous woman does not know that if she has a job it is because clients contribute

This visit was a 2nd vax. and to be fair, the center itself seemed otherwise quiet/closed.  Really, a great community resource and thoughtfully planned. There are beautiful moments throughout the campus, from the tranquility of the atrium garden to the alluring aroma of the flowers on the California Buckeye tress, definitely worth a visit when the various centers reopen.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Great place. Glad my town offers these services. Over the years Ive used the preschool, activity center, the theatre, and most of the grounds for various fairs. The place is really a gem. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Do wish the fair ticket prices were more reasonable but I'm not sure who determines that.</Review>< Time>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>I've been there for musical events. A very elegant place locally, to take in a show. Weekdays the parking lot that circles the center is great for walking. Twice around = 1 mile. Sure beats the canal walkways, which can be congested at times. Take in The Nutcracker during the holidays. Very family friendly.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Large building, multiple rooms, one very large gathering area which can be made smaller by sliding walls. Tables and chairs are available. A large bar area, kitchen and stage. Have your next event at RP Community Center<//Text>

The only reason I ever go to the Rohnert Park Community Center is some event at Spreckle's. After the Luther Burbank Center north of Santa Rosa, Spreckle's is probably the finest performing arts Venue in Sonoma County.</Text>

<review>Louis is an awesome guy he also gave us a great deal with the cage, food, and the 2 parakeets! His birds are so beautiful and well taken care of. He will also clip the wings for you and informative with any questions. There is a long line to get in, but it's worth the wait! I highly recommend this place to all fellow bird lovers!👍</review>< date>

I bought my Cockatiel, Pepper, from Louis in May (1st picture). Pepper was hand fed and right from entering the store and taking Pepper out of the cage to hold, Pepper was friendly and liked being held. Since then, Pepper has been so happy and is very affectionate. Louis and team have done a great job helping these furry friends be ready for their future homes. Today, I went back to Louis to get Pepper's nails trimmed. He did a wonderful job and I didn't hear a squawk nor screech come from Pepper. (2nd picture). Louis was kind enough to give us fresh water for the ride home (it was over 95° outside). Thank you Louis for raising your birds to be friendly and ready for their homes. &thank you for treating Pepper so well when trimming his nails. I will definitely be back when another trim is needed and maybe in the future to get Pepper a friend. 😄< /text>

Louis is knowledgeable and friendly! The shop and cages are well maintained,  and the birds are heathy.
There was a line, which I understand is common, but so worth it! We will be regular customers for sure!!!<//review>

I got two Cockatiels from Louis which almost unavailable in all San Jose pet stores during Civid 19 outbreak. They are hand feeding so they are able to stand on my hands after 2 days of training. The owner speaks fast with a lot of helpful information, and he allows one guest each time to enter the store but you don't need appointment. The store opened far later than 1pm that day, and you may want to come after 2pm or 3pm. All in all its a good place for pet bird and supply, call the owner first to check availability and remember to wear a mask.<//review>

I went in today looking for a pet bird. Let me start off by saying that the store is absolutely gorgeous. There’s lose parrots that are so calm and super adorable. He asked what I was looking for and gave me different options of birds and even let me touch them. He gave me such a great deal (food,cage, toys, etc) and of course an addition to the family. I definitely recommend this place.</Review>

I am so grateful for the friendly service that I received and the helpful advice in choosing the best bird for my 14-year-old son Zach. I purchased an Albino Cockatiel which my son named “GUY”. This bird has taught my son responsibility, and has brought him so much joy in such a sad and frustrating time we live in with COVID. He is so good and protective when it comes to his pet.  I am so proud of the care he takes of him! I am grateful for the package that was put together from the birdcage to the toys- i bought- to the huge bag of food that came with him. These birds are hand fed and are such happy creatures. This was the best choice I could have possibly made for a pet for Zach. Thanks to my friend Kyle referring me to Louis Bird Pet Store! I received excellent customer service and attention was all ours when we were choosing our bird. I would definitely recommend anyone  considering to buy a pet to rethink the conventional Pet such as the dog or cat or fish and invest in a bird! I also highly recommend that you visit this store.  The amazingly beautiful colorful and not so colorful birds in this pet store are well with every penny because these birds are well taken care of and hand fed and give so much love and bring laughter into a home!</Review>

I went into the store yesterday and i had asked if he had any baby cockatiels and he only had one. I got to hold it and pet it and i wss a little nervous at first and now he is attached to me. I love it. This guys knows his stuff about bired and has a good size bird store with supplies. I would say i would go back again later on sometime to even get another bird. :)< /text>

I got  a male Cockatiel about a week ago, (walnut) he is super friendly and doesn't want to go to his cage. He just hangouts with us all day from shoulder to shoulder.Since he is 3 months old he barely flies. I really appreciated what owner told and explained to us how we should take care of the bird. Just the location of the store is a bit mess but overall it is amazing. Ill go back again to get fresh millets once walnut finishes them all.</text>

The owner was super rude. I drove over an hour to get there after confirming the open time the previous day. I waited for a half an hour outside and was getting ready to leave when the owner finally showed up. He said that to wait a few minutes while he gets the birds out. Another half hour, he finally let me in and was super rude. I inquired about several birds and all he could say was "how much money do you have?" over and over "how much money do you have?"... I asked him how much the Amazon was and he wouldn't give me a price but said " probably too much money for you!"
No manners, no customer service, and not on time to open their shop. I'll spend my money elsewhere.<//Text>

<text>I purchased a budgie about a month ago.  The owner is very direct and to the point which some ppl may take it as rude but i appreciated his approach and how knowledgeable he was.  The fact that I only allows one customer in at a time made me feel comfortable considering the pandemic. I have no complaints and will be returning soon.<//text></record>

<text>Louis provides a very nice service. He is always really helpful with providing helpful facts and takes good care of all his past and current clients. We got an amazon bird from him a year ago and recently gotten his nails clipped. The experience with him is always super fast and calming for the birds,  because you know they get crazy.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Didnt seem like the hand fed cockatiel were of high quality. They were stored in large group in a single cage, very stressed, feathers didnt look right (make you wonder about their health) and they seem to be afraid of the owner. Didnt feel like they like or trust him. That should not be the case with good hand fed baby birds< /Review>

Louis is very knowledgeable about his birds. He hand feeds them and they are very tame. I got a pineapple conure from him and he is very tame and healthy. I really recommend this place!<//Review>

Is twisted!.....Our apologies for asking you your birds teamed preference.'}< /Resp><review>I had been Facebook messaging since April. I know exactly what I want.  I am a current bird owner.  I tried calling to no success and asked my husband to call.  Whoever it was answering the phone refused to answer basics (price, availability) but asked my husband a question I find very odd and concerning, “hand fed or wild?” as if both are available? Wild? Ummm... no.  Leaving that alone right now.

And because I’ve read plenty of reviews, I can already tell you, Owner.. your unstable blasts and attempts to turn around 99% of negative reviews to blame the customer? It’s both immature and alarming.  It’s not something managers and owners do “or else they will brake”. This is an honest review of my family’s experience with your shop. I’m not a competitor. I’m looking for a forever pet.  And with your showing, I will take my business elsewhere and caution my family and friends.  You need to get it together and read up on public relations and marketing.  Simple steps could dramatically change your Google reviews for the better.

My family owned a computer shop in the 80’s and 90’s. If we behaved even slightly like you did over the phone for my husband, we wouldn’t have had any success at all. I’m also a Fern Van Sant client. (Some of you locals probably know her, and I’m betting you can see why I’m referencing her as “I can take a strong attitude”.) She schooled me correctly.  She’s also shamelessly blunt. At times could be called abrasive.  But she’s a vet I love.  And her office has basic manners and treats clients with respect. (She’s not a direct competitor, so don’t get all twisted if you think I’m reviewing another company here on your wall.)< /review><date>1596587028266< /date>< user>

Really friendly and knowledgeable bird expert who started from humble beginnings. He has a wide variety of birds: lovebirds, finches, doves, Rosies, macaws, cockatoos, and African Grays. He also has a wide assortment of Budgies (also known as parakeets): American, English (huge parakeets that have big foreheads and are in steroids, really cute), Latino, and albino.

He strikes good deals with his clients. A tip here is to bring cash and to find street parking.<//review>

<review>I would NOT recommend this guy he had a variety of birds, but he abuses them grabs them out of the cage by their necks, he has SUCH overpriced birds, and thinks he knows everything about birds and try’s to convince the buyer that he knows a lot. But when you actually know things about birds you would know that he is a TERRIBLE bird owner and a very bad shop.<//review>< Pics>

Great store to purchase healthy birds, food and supplies.  I checked a couple of the big box stores and just wasn't happy with what I observed.  Louis Birds was recommended and I've very happy that we checked it out.  We were looking for a parakeet and we had multiple options of very healthy looking birds from which to choose.  The owner  is great; he knows his stuff and we enjoying the time at the store as we picked out our new bird.  Very highly recommended.</Text>

<user_id>117995335416437278187< /user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><review>Excellent bird shop. They have amazons to canaries, and they all look happy and healthy. In fact, I think the birds here are happier than the birds at big box stores, where  got mine, and that is really nice to see in a pet business. Cages are clean, water and food is clean. It is clear that the shop cares about their birds and keeps them healthy and comfortable.  The owner Louis, is very knowledgeable and I learned a few things to take better care of my bird. The shop has bird food too and I picked up some of that. Pricing is competitive. They also have cages, bowls, etc... Overall this shop is really cool and if you are looking for a bird or bird supplies, this is the best bird store in San Jose. Highly recommended.< /review>< Rate>

I left a message asking about cockatiels and the owner called, harassed me, and hung up on me. All I asked him for was to give me an estimate over the phone which he refused. Why would you deal with a potential customer that way? I called because shopping there would mean a long drive for me. I guess I’m glad I found out what a jerk the store owner is over the phone than wasting time going into his shop!< /review>

<user_name>Andrea Silva Servin</user_name><Text>I've been meaning to place a review for this shop. My husband and I purchased a sun conure not too long ago and Louise was super nice to us. For those who say that he comes off as "rude" and "unprofessional" need to calm down. That's the personality that he displays. My husband thought he was really nice and funny.

We've also had a friend and her husband who have purchased 3 Cockatiels recently from him and all are great friends. We've never had an issue when getting our birds.

If you see an issue, speak up. He's not forcing you to buy anything. Can't wait to come by again.< /Text>< Rating>

<Review>great store with lots of nice birds. constantly updating his inventory. My parrotlet i got from him has been doing good for almost 2 months.

<Text>Owner is knowledgeable and helpful. He has both hand raised birds and wild ones. We got a hand raised from him and I’m thrilled. I had a cockatiel before the one I bought here. My first cockatiel came from another spot and I had her for 10 year then she passed away. I’m so glad I found a bird shop again that has hand raised.

Ive only been here once and I plan on going again to get myself a bird, but from what I could tell the owner is caring and the birds are well cared for. The bigger ones (macaws, cockatoos) didnt seem to pluck and they weren't held inside cages. I see a fair amount of comments criticizing his behavior towards them and for that I have to say, it's probably because he loves these birds deeply and he doesn't want them going off to just anyone. What matters most are the birds the shop is dedicated to, how he treats the customers comes in seocnd and I respect that.< /Review>

< review>
I have not yet gone and I’m not sure to rather I’m actually getting another bird! It seems like an AMAZING place with well-trained birds. I have a lone budgie who actually HATES sharing cages and supposedly killed their ‘companions.’ They love other birds but are sensitive to sharing cages. I’d put my new bird in a separate cage from them and only have the two be together at playtime. Can’t wait to see all the birds! 🦜🥰🥳< /review>

<Text>Visited shop today from out of town. Louis has alot of knowledge about the birds. We were looking for a family bird and found the perfect one and a great deal. Louis and wife made us feel at home. They are very friendly and helpful. They didnt pressure us to buy and where honest as of what would be our best bird option. I recommend the shop 100%.< /Text><Rate>5</Rate><gmap_id>0x808e3335b611e1a7:0xb40ef943c20166ff< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

I tried to ask questions about parrots and they were rude and told me I was a kid and asked if my parents were around. I am an adult. I called again because I wanted to know what parrots they had and he was so rude and yelled that I just called him and that if I wanna see anything, to go on their website.</Text>

Said that the store was open at 11 but he made me wait til around 12 (approx 20 mins) because he showed up late. There was a sign saying that he "went out to get supplies" but when he showed up I didnt see he bring anything in. When he let me in he helped me find the bird I wanted with a discount of $5. The bird I got from him is fine and healthy. Overall this place is great and there is a large variety of birds there. Just make sure you call in and make sure he is in the store before you go in.</text>

Bought two lovebirds that are supposed to be hand fed around a month ago. They still aren’t tamed even though I interact with them daily. Black one is super skittish and yellow one bites hard. I don’t know what to do but they are healthy but wish I knew how hard it would be to tame them, especially when they are claimed to be hand fed. They aren’t tameable that’s for sure. They were pretty pricy for skittish lovies but the owner lowered it down to $125 each since we had to wait 25 minutes, pretty nice. It’s a nice store overall but next time, I definitely won’t be buying a lovebird, maybe only supplies, who knows.</text>

<text>One of his bird he gave to me had a bone sticking out when I bought him. When I told him this 20 minutes after purchasing, he said “it happens when they are trying to crack their egg” he wouldn’t accept me getting a new one. Here I am, 6 DAYS later, having that same bird not digesting, not moving, not even able to stand. We rushed him there and asked what was going on because he told us to come to him when we got our buddy. He accused us of poorly treating him, and blamed us for this. He gave us another bird, I told him that he was acting as if that dying bird was a cracked rock, not important.

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Found out about this shop from a guy that works at petco because I was looking for a male parakeet and they only had baby parakeets and he mentioned Louis's shop. I went about a month ago and he was very friendly and very helpful. I was able to get the male bird and it was a perfect bird for my female but then my husband let it escape :) So instead of going to petco I went straight to Louis. I ended up getting 2 additional birds. Louis is very knowledgeable about birds and all the birds he has are gorgeous. You can really tell that he takes extreme care for them. Not only can you tell but when you go in there he is very proud and likes to talk about all the progress he has made with the birds and show them off. I think this is an awesome thing because you know you will be getting the best of the best. This is now my go to place and I hope one day I will be able to get one of the parrots because they are amazing. Thanks Louis for all your help and Ill be back to get another nesting box :)< /Review>< GmapID>

Ramos review seems like a non sense trying to put the owners business down,but as far as I know I bought a parrot from this store ,he sells his birds for a fair price and does discounts if you buy two of them ,he also trades birds if you want to return your bird just have to pay the difference, most parrots the cheapest one in California stores cost 2.5k but he sells them for 1.2k, unlike one pet store this store doesn’t smell like sheep ,he also trimmed my parrots nails,I’d visit the store again< /Text>

I love this place and although Louis doesn't do a lot of birdsitting, he did me a big favor and took care of my conure. I would not trust anyone else taking care of my baby. Louis has always treated me nicely even when I stop in to visit him and his birds. I wish I could have them all.  All the big birds love him and always demand his attention. It's a nice place to buy a bird and bird supplies.<//Review>

<Text>The worse customer service I had ever in my life. The owner was very rude and almost kicked us out his shop. We were surprised with his aggressive behavior against us. My wife and my two daughters, 9 & 6 years, were terrified from the way he dealt with us.

Mr. Louis, your behavior that you showed us today is not acceptable and it insulted us, specially after our discussed regarding my budget and how much we can afford to buy a Parrot to my daughters, and you made fun of us by offering small sick parakeet and saying that what your $200 will get you. This is really not acceptable and hurt us. Your behavior was very mean and impacted my daughters.

I wish people read this and see the ugly side of you and your business.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1590380811332, 'text': 'Thank you for your review , we appreciated .,know  that in know days clients sometimes are also rude and offensive when they try  to put a price to a pet bird  precious creature which I have nurtured and hand feed months before is place for sale .am a very direct person and I do apologize if you where hurt or offended ,but no one is going to price my pets ,is not nice to involved your family on this .'}< /response>< GmapID>

The owner Louis is very rude and not welcoming and when I was shown a Parrot to hold he was not careful with handling the bird the bird bit my hand luckily not breaking skin and blamed me for being scared when I put my arm out carefully and steady not to intimidate the bird.

I would never buy anything from this store very filthy environment as well !!!< /review>

No parking, no handfed birds.. 3 day return only . He answers ? On the defensive. Its hard to get a word in.  Pay with card not cash.  You will never get a refund , it's just exchange. I thought the owner was dishonest at times and charged me more then what I received.  The parrot I got was handfed but is cage bound which tells me interaction with the birds is zero. The owner is just off.  I am looking for something else and cannot return. We thought we were taken advantage of not knowing alot about parrots and will tell you anything to just get a sell.  Research and Make sure you know what to ask ist before considering anything .

I think the biggest problem here is the owner is simply not honest and can tell he does not take care of his pets.

<text>I was looking for a blue lovebird for my male because it’s mate flew away, so I looked through stores and this one had the best review. I told my grandma about it and she took me, two days later I had a blue female lovebird that was healthy and beautiful! But I felt disappointed because of this bird  at the store that was so kind and trained to do a coin trick and sit on my shoulder ( it was a cockatoo). Soon I craved for that bird to be my friend because my grandpa refuses to let me have a dog even when he used to own a farm with like a billion trillion dogs!!! But he would let me have a bird. Even though I have 4 lovebirds, 1 chicken and 4 quails I really just wanted a bird that sat on my shoulder. First of all my birds are afraid of me and second of all I wanted a bird with a tough beak for some reason. Then I found out it was sold so I was really disappointed but I still decided to write the review because the store is the best!!!!!! REALLLLYYYYYYYYY REALLLLLLLYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I hope you choose this store to  be your choice!!

The birds look sick. Dirty store and the larger birds walk around the dirty floor. Pigeons come in from outside and walk around the same floor as the larger birds, threatening disease transmission. Little selection of bird toys/feed.  Seems purely like a parrot mill. Seems like they only care about moving birds and not about the birds themselves. Won't be visiting again.<//review>

I really enjoy  doing what I do, criticism help me to be aware and improve,helps to find out likes and deslikes from visitors and know who they are  and correct mistakes to provide better customer service. I choose to dedicate my self to this profesion,not only for profit which help to pay my bills with an honest work, but because I love  to take care about the birds that I have . Birds are a therapy for me .I am telling you this, because I want you to comprehen that is very easy to make assumtions sometimes based on negative commentaries from people that desagree from profiting from these business model, or just because you are not use to the type of enviroment seems that you do not underestand much about business or I may be wrong,  call my attencion that you made, also assumtions about my supplies inventory and about the birds number and spicies I carry, I invite you to come and help me to improve what you are considering I am doing wrong,I believe that if you are believing I am doing wrong in my business, there is enogth reason for you to comeback to visit me for a day and work with me to correct the reason from your one start rating.call me 408 387 2664'}</resp>

<Review>We Love Louie!  We have 2 conures, 2 parakeets and 2 canaries.  We go and see him frequently to ask questions and buy supplies.  My daughter is constantly asking "can we see louie today?".  If the naysayers spent any time in the shop, they would know that louie loves his birds.  What is even more remarkable is that he seems to almost know every bird in his shop and there are plenty of them.  We recently bought a canary and he said, "why don't we give you that one.  He is my best singer".  Louie, you are the best!  With our canaries now having 4 eggs, Louie in counseling us on how to take care of the canaries when they are born.< /Review><gmapID>0x808e3335b611e1a7:0xb40ef943c20166ff< /gmapID>< userid>

I goggled the directions and drove over. No indication that it was a business.  No office. No signs. No parking lot, mostly a turnaround spot as it is at the end of Blue Cloud road.
So, I walked my dog down the dirt road about 100 ft to some penned animals, emus, llamas, a donkey. They were sweet but guarded. The donkey actually opened a gate and walked into a paved, human area. He looked like he might be a handful.
Other than that the place was deserted. I felt like I might be at Cesar's house or something,  so I left. As I was leaving, a woman in a golf cart drove into the turnaround and approached me. She quietly indicated that I was on private property. I said I knew that and was leaving.
So, I wish I could say more as I am a huge fan. The website lead me to believe it was a business. Otherwise, I would not have gone there.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>I have never visited Cesar Millan's Dog Psychology Center, but it is my dream to visit one day. He is a blessing, and I have a Rotti (his heart's desire) that I know could benefit from his assistance--the trainer died in middle of teaching and Sasha is mean!!

Anyway, THANK YOU Cesar (and family) for all you do! You absolutely help me in my profession as a Social Worker.</Text>< pics>

Cesar is a special breed on his own. His concept regarding energy is 100% correct. His logic is simple and works becausr it's about understanding how dogs think and react compared to a human worl where often dogs are treated like humans.

The negative reviews seem to focus on high cost but when you want the best it carriesa cost. Cesar can not be expected to do everything for nothing. Give the man a break, I'm sure he has a very busy schedule and more work than he can handle.

There will always be jealous people who will attack people because they wish they had his talent and touch. Cesar has paid his dues coming to the US illegally with almost nothing and working hard to where he is. He's only human bit you can tell connects with people with good energy. Give him a break, fame can be hard on people and relationships.<//text>

<Text>Like everything , there are advantages and dis-advantages ..

Besides of i  totally agree  with the 1st. comment of J R. I would add the following :

The technical  material , the course and the final result .

The Material are very good, I liked it, Cesar himself has the talent for sure, and he is able to give you the right answer,  He answers all questions.

The walk with him was very limited ( Short in time) , would have been much better making the course with much less number of people ( was about 25 students or more )  ..  With more focus  ,  small round tables for small groups..  the investment I paid was not little, worth more time for each student  ..

After the course i was able to better understand  and interact with my Dog. that is for my case.

They did a great effort for hospitality, Support was given by the trainers in logistics and arranging  me a Dog  ( i was coming all the way from Cairo, Egypt ).

Thanks,</Text>< Pics>

Not so sure I want to be his fan anymore. Seems like his family turned him into quite the opposite of friendly. I to be honest think famous people suck. They just think they are better than everyone else. I have trained many dogs basic obedience and beyond training and have had no Pryor experience at all its just a gift that comes with the territory of being AWESOMELY AUTISTIC. it's just basic common sense really.< /Text>

I first came here because me and my dogs got attacked by other dogs on a walk. I got scared after that and my dog started acting out. I came to the Dog Psychology center and they helped me better understand my dog's behavior and my own role as a dog owner/guardian. I appreciate the staff, the accommodations are awesome, and my relationship with my dogs went to a whole other level. Very happy client!< /text>

<date>1479937588579</date><text>Pros and Cons of the Cesar's Way Fundamentals Class:
Pros: it's a super fun and entertaining class, you get a free leash and a free bag

Cons: -It's no longer taught by Brian Agnew and Cheri Lucas unfortunately.
-the class is huuuuge with over 30 people and 30 dogs. it costs $6000 which is insanely high.
-You only get to meet Cesar on the morning pack walk for about 3 minutes and he seems like he would rather be sleeping than walking with you and talking to you about your dog.
-there are so many dogs in the class that your dog might not get picked for any demonstrations or activities
-almost all dogs are so well behaved that they really don't need any corrections. (I was expecting red-zone dogs that you can really learn from)
-all your trainer conversations are with 6 to 8 different trainers (some paid some volunteers) who have totally different answers to the same question, leaving you more confused than ever
-if you watch every single episode of the Dog Whisperer, you will get the same information that's presented in the class.
-the whole experience feels very 'cult"-ish
In summary; if you are a person with limited finances, I think you are better off paying $6000 to either Cheri or Brian to rehabilitate you and your dog. Your dog will appreciate it more. If you have $6000 to blow on entertainment, take the classes</text><GmapID>0x80c27d4bd0531e6f:0x2a23f48d21d13ada< /GmapID><Rate>3<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_name>

Hello mr. MILAN

this is Amit from INDIA..one day i suddenly came across your youtubr videos and i was just awestruck at watching the way mr. Milan controls the dog behaviour...bunch of wishes to this gentleman for the task he does.

Coming to the point . I have a 5 month old male lab puppy..he is a very playful one but tha problm that i face with him is that as i open the main door he just rushes through it. How to control this behaviour of his??
And second is , he is quite lethargic while having his food...he takes around 3 4 hr to complete his meal..any solution fr dis??

Warm regards sir
Amit dey.</review>

My name is Amber and I am a big fan of yours.  Ive watched most of all your shows and Ive had dogs on my own and trained my self to train them the way you do and never had a problem... I'm an animal lover my self and I've seen your beautiful ranch in TV. I hope that some day, I can have an opportunity to meet you in person and to meet your beautiful ranch because one of my dreams is to become a dog trainer abd maybe you can teach me in person, how to become a dog trainer abd if you ever have a dog training school, please let me know to become one of your students because I love dogs. Thank you for accepting this message and I will be waiting eagerly for your responce... Thank you Cesar and good luck in your new.< /text><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I was lucky to be able to visit this place and I have to say that I found it incredible. They are all very friendly! We did not have the pleasure of meeting César, which I would have loved but it was still an unforgettable experience. Congratulations on all your work! You are magnificent.

<review>Was referred here from a local dealership for a car rental while my car is in the shop. To be fair, I didn’t ask what time they closed, as I saw on Google they closed at 6.

Turns out, they close at 5. When I arrived after work, I was greeted with a “We’re closed. We close at 5.”.

So, I called an Uber. While waiting I took a picture of their updated hours and posted them to their Google Maps page. (I’m so helpful!)

While doing so, another employee said approached me, I explained my situation as they said “We’re closed.”, again. I told them the dealership sent me but that they didn’t tell me the hours. The employee said, “Well, they know we close at 5.”. I replied, “Fair enough.”, and waited about 20 minutes in a parking lot for my Uber while all the employees locked up and joyfully left for the day.

Look, I can’t blame them, when it’s closing time, it’s time to go. I get it.

I won’t be coming back during regular operating hours.

Bonus photo of me showing what time they actually close.<//review><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I Wish There is a ZERO STAR option!!!! They just put us in a huge mess. THEY CANCEL OUR RESERVATION just a few hour before the picking up time with a brief voicemail saying that they have no car even though we made reservation a week ago. We were on the airplane by the time, and only saw the voicemail after landing and all of our plan got messed up! I called them to ask and requested compensation because this was a one side cancellation and it is within less than 24 hrs of the reservation. If they can charge us 200$ for late cancellation, how come they can just do watever they want without the penalty?!!!! I can’t believe what they told me tho “I’m sorry but there will be no compensation. There are many other customers that got cancel like u as well”. Excuse me?? Is that something u feel proud about? Ur business is messed up! I feel sorry for all other travelers who were in the same situation like me. Not to mention, if there were many people who got cancelled like me, it didn’t change the fact that it was your company’s fault for not being able to manage your business and keep your contract with customers. I wanna advise y’all . NEVER BOOK W HERTZ AGAIN IF U DON’T wanna landed in a unfamiliar place and struggling to find a vehicle in last minutes, while the company just DENIES ALL OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES!!!!<//review>

<review>Super friendly employees. Always helpful and NEVER complain when a customer shows up 1 minute before closing, hahahaha.

They don't have the dream cars but the cars they have are reliable. This location mostly services the surrounding dealerships and body shop customers.

This is also one of the only hertz locations with cargo vans that are mostly not available because of the Amazon delivery drivers that are smart and rent hertz vans with unlimited mileage for cheap daily rates rather then put the miles and wear on there own vans.< /review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I recently went to San Fernando Valley and while there my car broke down. I was having such a horrible experience and then decided I had to rent a car. Hertz in Glendale was the only Hertz with a car available without making me waste time. The Madeline’s customer service really made my day. Everyone there was super nice. I am definitely coming back to this location for all my future car rentals!!< /review>< Pics>

They failed to advise us they didn’t have a vehicle for us even though we made an online reservation and received a confirmation notification. They didn’t try to work with us to resolve the issue and simply said we have to cancel the reservation.</text>

<review>Absolutely disappointed!! Don't rent any cars from here or from Hertz in general!! The one time I wanted to try something new of course it was a terrible experience. I will never betray Enterprise ever again! My girlfriend went on Saturday & the customer service was god awful, the ladies at the front desk used vulgar language towards my girlfriend & discriminated her! She refused to serve us & one of the girls couldn't even complete a sentence or pull up over reservation. They will discriminate you here!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing while on the phone with my girlfriend. They even told my girlfriend's daughter that she couldn't come it. Go to Enterprise instead where they know what real customer service is!! Don't waste your time or money with these people!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<text>I rent a car monthly and I have dealt with several other companies. Hertz in glendale always makes sure to work with me to ensure I have the best experience possible. They care about their performance. You definitely might need some patience from time to time also because they are very busy, so try get there early and make sure you book online that should facilitate your experience.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyJH_BR-ROkkhEp4Kiewx9smn3oqyr-UTS0x8t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I needed a car to accomplish some moving tasks this past March. While the car was great, we received a call from this Hertz an HOUR before they closed that they were changing their stated hours, leaving us out to dry and forcing us to drive to Burbank Airport to pay extra to return our car. While I'm grateful they were available during COVID-19, renting from here was such an awful experience after a long day.</review>

Absolute worst!!! This guys a scam. My rental with hertz had a flat tire and I dropped it with them. They had a lot full of cars and they refused to give me a car by saying non of the cars are available. That is insane! They wouldn't even arrange with another location to give me a rental. The the attitude was bad. I'm going to be reaching out to corporate and I will be emailing customer care. You will be hearing from me.</text>

< review>
I came back with my daughter to redeem a $90 credit which she was told can be used on her next rental. They refused to rent to her. I had to put the weekly rental under my name and was charged a $12 late return fee when I returned the rental on time. BTW I probably shouldn't forget to mention, the $90 credit is their "reimbursement" for a fuel charge... She returned the rental with a full tank...WTF. Check your fees they'll try and squeeze every penny out off you.< /review>

Friendly staff. Willing to work with you. Was in and out in no time. Only downside is parking is awful and leaving the lot is challenging because of blind spots and traffic<//text>

Trevon makes all transition effortless and remains calm even when people are being aggressive/ uptight. There always seems to be a line but I think it’s cuz the staff is very easy to work with. It’s the reason I keep Doing being with Hertz<//Review>

VJ and Ani have been very helpful. The process was quick. I reserved through AAA to get discounts and am a Hertz loyalty member so I get points. 4 stars because their office needs plants, but I get it. You're not there to lounge. 🤷🏽‍♀️ I am a little confused about my invoice, so I have to make a quick phone call. I'll update my rating once I get clarification.</text>

By far the best customer service of any other location or car rental agency. I drive out of my way to rent from this location because of the fast and friendly service I always receive at the Glendale, CA hertz location! Never had a bad experience with this team and I've been renting cars for business and leisure for 9 years now.<//review>

Customer service was friendly and professional, they're prepay for gas option is way too high. The Pico location does prepay gas for $1 cheaper. I gave 4 stars because I made a reservation and yet they needed to uber me to their North Hollywood location due to lack of cars...</review>

<Text>I waited over 45 min to get the car! I reserved it a month ago. When I asked why it wasn’t ready their response was first come first served.??? I said I have a freaking reservation. Her response was, we are not sure what car you were going to want so we can’t have it ready. They never gave me an option on the different vehicles to choose from in that class lol. Horrible service! The customer is always right! I should’ve just went to enterprise across the street where they know how to do business.

Ps.. tell you car wash maintenance guys that instead of grouping together and talking and laughing, they should be washing the cars as they come in so people don’t have to wait an hour to get a car that been reserved for over a month.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I did reservation online through AAA for a mid car on 01/22/2019, when I went to pick up the car the employee didn't ask me the cars available he just gave me a 2018 Nissan Sentra. it was not washed properly looks like he cleaned with a damp rug you can see all the strikes with the dust, inside of car all dusty,the paint had a lot of damage by duct tape and the car had a terrible bad odor, he didn't showed me the car he just parked the car on the side walk on the exit of the lot, I was in a hurry to go to work so I didn't want to be arguing with him.<//Review>

<text>very slow service when i return my rental and asked for a reimbursement because of the change oil i did with the car, the guy took so long and after getting through all the process to be done he just told me the car i rented has a windshield chip while i waited for so long and didn’t pull me out letting me know right away when i went back and check the car it looks like the chip has done moment ago. i did car wash myself the car before returning and didn’t notice any damage.. i’d been renting car through other car rentals did’t have any issue with little scratch.. the only good thing i got it for a cheap deal.. my only disappointment is letting me know later on about the chip while he can do it at very first when he got the keys.. other staff very helpful is just this one guy.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This branch is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!  My daughter rented from them and everything they promised was a lie.  She had a Gold rental and reserved a VW (which she strongly prefers).  When she arrived, they said they just gave away her car.  Then they gave a class worse Nissan but did not lower her rate.

When she returned it, she was 10 minutes after the due time (and within the 30 minutes grace period advertised online.) . The manager charged her a $20 late fee!  When she responded that the online grace period was 30 minutes, the manager said look at the asterick and read the fine print - which allowed them to charge a fee.  $20 for 10 minutes is $120 an hour.

Then they claimed that the fuel was low.  When she took it out, it was a little over half full.  She took a picture when she picked it up (top) and when she returned it (bottom).  (See picture).  There is no differnece, yet they still charged her $15.

She will never go back to this location.  Beware.  You have been warned.<//Review>

Bigger and broader rental car service in US and probably the world. You are just a "number" not a valued customer so expect a lot of unexpected thing to happens, last 2 months I have next ones: 1) I wanted to renew a rented car after 2 weeks by phone, they told me TWICE that I could, but when I wanted to do they denied to renew. Told me that I must return the car due "service scheduled" (A complete lie), that they will give me another one. At the end the clerk told that it was because it is an "Uber" Car. I took car in LAX (24hs) and return in Glendale, Glendale closes 1PM on Sunday, the told me that on 12 pm on Glendale, so I had to return car next day, I had to miss half of my working day, they care nothing about my problems even when they told me I could keep the car renewed by phone with no hassle.
2) They gave me a car with registry overdue, I have problems in DMV getting my license driver and I have to make an apto again. So basically I miss one appointment on DMV after 1 1/2 month. Hertz make my DMV "experience" worse than usual. Weird.
Good things: Rent a car in Hertz is easy, quick and they are spread on every large city and Airport.< /Text>

<Date>1529471814082<//Date><text>I am very angry with Hertz of Glendale, We called them and we waited for more than an hour for a ride to go to the office to rent a car and they called for a lyft and then afterwards they told us they cancelled for whatever reason and when we asked if they can send someone themselves they were putting a bunch of excuses. What they did was disgusting, immoral and most of all irresponsible for leaving us stranded and wasting our time. I will never do business with you people period. I'm going to calling your manager very soon to complain formally.  My mom had to walk for 4 blocks and she is almost 80 years old you people have no shame.<//text>< gmapID>

<review>Very disappointed with this location. Firstly, I made the reservation over the phone with corporate for a specific car and was told it was available at this location because my trip involved a 550 mile drive to a different state. I called the location afterwards just to verify they do indeed have it and they confirmed they did and was reserved. Corporate also told me that they will reimburse me for the lyft/Uber cost which I was pleased with. I called the location on Sunday letting them know I’m going to need a lift and they told me they don’t offer that service and that I was misinformed (finding out yesterday after a week from returning the car back that Hertz DOES infact offer this). Already I was confused and upset because it was expensive. I arrived to the location only to find out that the car I wanted wasn’t available and I had to choose a different vehicle that was far less gas economical until some other renter returned a car when I got there that somewhat matched my criteria, so I had to choose that one. I was behind 2 hours on my trip because the representatives worked very slowly, joked around, and were completely unprofessional. I was never informed of the deposit required $200 dollars and that only cash was accepted. Corporate told me everything different than what these guys did. The car had a sensor issue and kept beeping the whole trip and I had to drive 45minutes from the town I was in to another hertz in Arizona for them to take the car and check
What’s wrong with it. Glendale representatives never told me that the previous renter had damaged something which is why that was happening. I wouldn’t have been surprised if they would have blamed it on me if I didnt take the initiative to get to the bottom of it. Upon returning the car, the only positive thing they did is waive the additional day I had to have the car because I had to go out of my way and spend another day in Arizona because of the car issue. I was told by the manager of this location that my cash deposit would be returned on my card with in 5 business days and after a week and a half I called corporate AGAIN and they told me that no that info is incorrect and that cash deposits are sent back via a check in the mail and take up to a MONTH. This location is so disappointing and unfortunately because of this experience I won’t use Hertz again. I don’t recommend going to these guys. Totally uninformed and if you do go, keep corporate on the line on stand by and make sure anything they say is correct.< /review>< pics>

If you can help it... DON'T RENT from this location. I LOVE Hertz and I am a Gold Member and this location does the brand NO justice.
Be CAREFUL they're gonna try and cheat you if you aren't careful. I found out once my statement came in for the month.
It's now July and I rented in February from them and I finally won my case back, because they double charged me.
Again, you don't have to take my word for it; but a word to the wise, "Stay away from this location."<//Text>

<time>1400515610066<//time><Rate>1<//Rate><text>First, I'm a Hertz 5-star Gold renter, the Glendale location does not carry any of the controls you would expect from a Hertz store.  I would describe my experience as "sketchy", like buying a used car from some shady dude at some "credit" auto mart.  They had my small car available, but with several other customers on hand, appeared to be very disorganized in their dealings with me.  First, they tried to upsell me to an SUV but I needed a locking trunk.  Then, they told me they would put some gas in my vehicle because it had come back empty.  They put in only 1/2 a tank for some reason.  A quick vacuum and walk-around to mark the damages and I was off.  Surprised when I returned the vehicle to LAX, they had marked the vehicle out with a full tank, and had the starting mileage wrong.  My rental contract had me paying for miles and I was charged for 190 miles to drive from Glendale to Long Beach and then back to LAX. I only put $9 of Gas into the car to keep it at the half tank mark.  I did not drive even half of 190 miles.  I at least had my paper showing the car started with half a tank and got that fixed with some time spent at the customer service counter.  CHECK THE STARTING MILEAGE at these little fly-by-night Hertz locations, CHECK EVERYTHING!   They are shady, sketchy little businesses that in no way remind you of Hertz at the airport.  If possible, avoid the Glendale Hertz and expect to be on-guard when there.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c2c0e2ff273595:0xa050b505188977ef< /GmapID></record>

<review>They bait and switch you to a more expensive car, even when you have a reservation and they say the car is in stock. But when you get there they don't have your car. So it's take this more expensive car or your screwed and you don't have a car. They refuse to upgrade you for free, which is what every car rental company I have used has done when they don't have you car in stock. WORST RENTAL CAR EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE.

Getting the car was an extremely horrible experience but we couldn't get one from anywhere else because this was the closest place and the only place with the cars. The porter was extremely rude and was yelling at me just because I was being dropped off in the front. Minut there was no parking for customers there's not even a place for you to get dropped off apparently. One of the employees seem to be drunk. First and last time I'll be renting from there<//review>

<text>I have been with Hertz Gold Club Member for over 7 years now and have never had a issue. But the experience I just had with location has made me not trust Hertz and I will never use them again. I was given a dirty Nissan Versa that smelled so bad of smoke that it gave me a migraine. Then I drove 7 miles home as my car was in the repair shop and noticed the gas was down 1/4 of a tank of gas. 7 miles for a 1/4 tank what the heck. So now after 2 days of rental I'm returning it and I drove a total of 33 miles and it cost me $14.00 (3.968 gallons) to fill up the car. You do the math, that is 8.13 miles per gallon. This is a car that is suppose to get 30MPG. So leaves me to believe this location scams renters on gas as this car didn't have a full tank of gas when it was given to me and yet I have to return it full.

NEVER EVER rent at the Hertz location and be careful of any Hertz location.</text>< Pictures>

DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!!!  The website has the capability to book a car, add features, etc. yet when you select the free pick up service, they claimed they had no idea the customer selected it even though the website specifically asks for a pick up address, phone number, special instructions, and sends you an email stating that if Hertz has any questions regarding the pickup, HERTZ will contact the customer.  Instead, the "professionals" at the Glendale location, who could barely speak, said that it was up to the customer to inform Hertz of the pickup over the phone.  Why ask for a pickup address then?  How can your branch accept information for booking from the corporate servers but not the pickup information? Then, once I told them my address, they asked if I called the wrong location because I requested a pickup in a different city, and stated I was to far to pickup (10 miles).  I immediately canceled the reservation and contacted another vendor.  Stay away from the Glendale location!!!!! Very unprofessional, horrible customer service, and an I.Q. less than room temperature.< /Text>

< Review>
I was given the wrong car( requested an AWD/4WD) and was given a Nissan Pathfinder 2015 SU.  Had to wait for the following day to get the requested vehicle since I was going to the mountains where snow was falling,  I returned the vehicle 2 hours late and the good thing was the upgrade fee of $40 for the first day was applied to the late delivery.<//Review>

< Review>
I'm a President's Circle Member which is reserved for Hertz' most frequent renters.  I have rented from this location numerous times.  For the most part, the employees are great (Trey, etc.) although they are grossly understaffed and have been this way for years (expect a wait). Here's my biggest issue:  They often advertise cars and trucks that they do not have available.  In fact, the last two times I reserved a truck from this location, they did not have it available and instead offered me a cargo van or minivan in place.  Clearly, a truck is not even remotely in the same class as a minivan.  I truly believe that if you're a major car company and you entered into a rental agreement with one of your best customers for a specific type (or even class) of vehicle, you should honor that agreement.  I know things go wrong, but this is the second time this has happened making me think that this is how they do business.<//Review>

<review>I prepaid for a car that they apparently don't have.  They will of course upgrade me for a charge.  And I have to wait 3 hours for that upgrade to show up.  And did I mention that car is now available for rental while I'm waiting because I'm on a lottery list and not a confirmed reservation list?< /review><Name>Kale Burditt</Name>< user>

Unprofessional. Messy. Rude and never have my car or car ready.  For these prices I expect much more than I get.  It took over a week to get my "hold" money back.</review>

This is a disaster. Avoid if possible. The employees tend to blame the customers for any mishaps, wait, etc. Both times I've been here I waited over an hour to pick up and over thirty minutes to drop off< /Review>

<text>This was the worst rental experience I’ve ever had. The fuel was at 1/4 tank when I picked it up, and didn’t notice until ~15 minutes after getting the van. There were pieces of glass in the back, a broken mirror above the seats, and it hadn’t been clean in forever. Had to pay $80 just to drop it off at LAX because by the time we got back to the location they were closed.< /text>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) Bad attention from the manager who wanted to scam us by saying that in California you need to have insurance on a compulsory basis, when he already had them all bought to take off. I include an additional LIS insurance, he did not want to give us the car !!! We had to say yes to continue traveling but I just contacted customer service there and they canceled all the charges !! I hope this person doesn't get a commission dollar for wanting to scam clients like this !!!

(Original)
Mala atención del gerente que nos quiso estafar diciendo que en California se necesitan tener los seguros de forma obligatoria, cuando ya los tenia a todos comprados en despegar. Nos incluyo un seguro adicional LIS, no nos quería dar el auto!!! Tuvimos que decir que si para poder seguir viaje pero ahí nomas me comuniqué con atención al cliente y me cancelaron todos los cargos!! Espero que esta persona no reciba un dólar de comisión por querer estafar así a los clientes!!!</Text>

<review>This was a a good place in Daly City. The food was really good, maybe a bit overpriced. The wings were pretty good. The flavor was great, but they were a bit chewy and slightly undercooked. The calamari was really good and so where the blistered peppers. The beers were inventive, but nothing blew my mind. The cherry hard seltzer was nice. The staff was great and the environment was welcoming with a lot of natural light. Also the owner/management don't seem to take constructive criticism very well. May give it another try next time I am in town from Portland.
Update: I was going to order some food for a friend in the area to pick up. 21$ for a cheeseburger(pickles/lettuce/sauce) and fries in a box! What! Add in gratuity and you are looking at 25$. I get it that restaurants need to get out of the hole, but that is a bit much. Maybe, just maybe that price is justified while dining there for the service and ambiance which is pretty nice. For about the same price, get a burger to go from Harris'. Lol< /review>< time>

<Review>Such a little hidden treasure in Daly City! It's kinda hidden in the side of a corporate building. I drive by here every day and I've never noticed it u til now. I just started coming here often when I get off bart. GREAT beer choices and appetizers. Great place for a first date or to catch up with an old friend.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808f7d538a1b5225:0x4374b3817e060ae9< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<review>Had the Belgium quad and was alright, not as hoppy and uplifting as the traditional Belgium Trappists ales.

Shortrib Burger was subpar. Meat patty wasn’t seasoned well and was quite bland in the middle.

Truffle fries didn’t have any hint of truffle flavor to it. Skip this option. Also not a fan of the ketchup as it’s too sweet.

Chicken sandwich is better than the burger, but keep in mind it’s pretty heavy. Not the crunchy skin you’d expect from a fried chicken sando.

Service is excellent though as the young wait staff are attentive, polite, and kind.

Food definitely isn’t worth the price. Will need to come back and try the other beers to determine if this will be a regular bar staple in our neighborhood.

We ordered a ton of food and we got lots of grumpy service. When we asked him for napkins, he pointed us towards the napkins at the public hand washing station to use. Half of the bags didn’t have utensils. He didn’t wear a mask at all, not while cooking and not even when he opened the door to hand out the orders.

As for the food itself, it was very subpar. The fries were overcooked and dry. The burger patty was cooked rare and not well flavored. The mushroom pizza was passable but the other pizzas weren’t in terms of flavor. The chicken sandwich was bad, there was like wilted sour vegetables on there instead of something refreshing like a slaw.

Not only that, it is so difficult to order from them. Doordash has only like half the items and no pizzas on there. If you use their app, you have to download it, then sign up for an account and it’s difficult to use.</text>

<review>This is my second time here. While they don’t have a big menu their food is always on point. I personally come for the pizza and salads.  “It’s so fresh it makes you wanna slap yo momma!!!”  If you love beer look no further. Steele is super awesome too... plus parking is free, the movie theater is like 25 steps away and if you want ice cream it’s just a few more steps away.  Plus the people that come here are cool if you’re a social butterfly.  It’s also a good place just to watch the game and chill. 😍🤪🍻</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Dropped by to pickup a beer. Locked @5PM, even though google says 8 PM. Employee inside just sits and looks at us. No response even when seeing we are outside. Crazy. People come to you to give you business during COVID and if you cannot even pick up the phone or manage your hours on Google, or respond personally then you should really close down permanently.< /Review><Time>1601772138946</Time>< Gmap_id>

We came to Gilman for the first time. I am glad a place like this opened in Daly City, easy free parking, close to the movie theater.

Ordered a Bianca pizza, good but a little oily.

The beer flight has 6 beers.

They need more servers -we came on a Thursday night, the place was busy and the service a little slow. The servers were nice.</Review>

I am glad you enjoyed our beer and food.\nRegarding your Bianca pizza: we brush the outer crust with extra virgin olive oil prior to sending it to the table, this may give it a shiny appearance but it adds a ton of rich flavor...we are hoping it makes you want to eat your crust, because i never did when I was child.\nWe have only been open 7 weeks now and are still working towards building staff to accommodate the new larger crowds... Please come back and we will do our best to get you that five star service you deserve! Thank you! - Chef Kurt'}</Response>

<time>1568515058034< /time><Review>I am very happy to have a brewery so close now. I have been waiting for ever for this place to open. Apparently tho they have been open longer than they seemed. I always thought they were closed because of the caution tape outside... Regardless, my wife and I went in and enjoyed the atmosphere. The decor is very thoughtfully chosen and quality. It feels like every detail was thought out! We sat at the bar and got to see flury of food made by some very professional looking and kind chefs that knew what they were doing. The one downside was the wait staff. We weren't really taken care of until a chef pointed to us, and didn't get our drinks til later. Something they need to clean up. They were friendly though! We ordered calamari to split, and....oh...my...gosh. My wife said this was the best calamari she ever had. I'd have to say it was the most flavorful I've had. But for me, best also factors in price. I was a little saddened to see the amount we got for the price.

In sum: I really want this place to succeed. I believe they have a lot of components that add up to a very popular and successful restaurant. My hope is that they get some more things streamline and set in place.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

What a find! This restaurant/tasting room offers fine-dining food in a really casual atmosphere. I ordered the octopus salad which was perfectly balanced and the octopus melted in my mouth. The mushroom pizza was the best I have had on the West Coast. The crust was perfectly charred and you can tell the cheeses were the best quality.  Chef Kurt told me that they cook the crust first for a bit in their wood burning oven and then add the toppings afterwards to insure that it doesn’t get soggy. The pork belly was juicy and arrived with a perfectly poached egg. The beer is carefully crafted and complimented all these dishes. When you visit, have a little patience as the front of the house undergoes growing pains.  You’ll find it’s totally worth it.<//Review>

The food alone is a reason to come to Gilman’s but they also have a wide selection of beer and wine that can fit your specific taste buds. All of the staff are wonderful and are happy to help find a beer that work for you. Me.Steele went above and beyond with my and my family. It was my 6 year old’s birthday and without asking, Mr.Steele offered my wife and I to dim the lights so that we could sing our daughter happy birthday with her cake.</Review>

Seriously a dope little taproom for Gilman Brewing! We needed something like this in Daly City for sure! Only had the beer but the menu looked good enough to come back to eat. Definitely want to try the pizza cooked in this awesome looking glass oven right in front of you as you sit at the bar.
Really loved every beer I had!!! I even tired some new things I never thought I would like; a Belgian sour and loved it! They make some really good beer! I will be back!</text>

<Text>This restaurant is located inside an office building and once we realized that, a lot of things made sense like why on a thursday evening at 8 PM they only had 3 beers out of their extensive menu available and everything else had run out. There were only 5 other people there when we went . However the fries were really good and they had the game on, so we chose from the 3 beers and had a good time.< /Text><Name>Anju Ja< /Name>< Date>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>It's nice to finally have a local place to enjoy saisons and sours (I'd give the beers a 4/5), instead of having to trek into SF or down the Peninsula. The food is also quite good and more creative than typical bar fare (4/5). Portions are large but pricey for the area (entrees in the upper $20s) - I suspect they would benefit from reducing prices and portions somewhat. I always judge a bar's kitchen by their fries, and the fries here are good. The real downside is the service - lacking in knowledge, slow and they kept forgetting to bring us items we ordered. Also, no high chairs available for little ones. Altogether, not very family-friendly. Hopefully they work out those kinks soon.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1566747382440, 'text': 'Yao, thanks for stopping in.\nWe are in our “soft opening phase,” you might have noticed we have not even started to advertise that we are open yet!  We are still hiring and training staff, working out logistical kinks, etc.\nthank you for your input here, high chairs were supposed to have arrived last week.  I’ll let the staff know to pick some up ASAP.\nPlease check back after we have the kinks worked out in a couple months, I think you will find both the food and the service to be much more what you expected.\nThanks again, appreciate the feedback.  Let me know when you’ll be back and I’ll make sure we get you a beer on us...\nCheers,\nsw'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
They're finally open!  Tried a flight of beers, and all of them were delicious.  Highly recommend this place if you're a big beer drinker.  I will be back many times!  The sour blackerry beer was great, check it out.  It has a very crisp aftertaste, and even those who aren't beer drinkers may like that one.

Mushroom pizza was delicious as well.  They used good quality mushrooms, and the crust was nice and chewy, but not too thick.  Pizza was a bit on the pricey side for $18/$19 for its size.  But it's clear that they used quality ingredients.

Service was a bit slow, it took a while to get our check.  Our server Lizz apologized.  She seemed a bit overwhelmed with the size of the crowd.  I think she was the only one taking orders that night.  Its clear they're still sorting things out, hence the soft opening.  Regardless, beer and food was great so I will be back!< /Review>

Asst Manager Justin failed to follow up as he promised regarding the monies illegally taken from my credit card, after my membership and fitness trainer had been canceled.

I had to follow up with my credit card company, who informed me, they know how to handle unethical Merchants such as Fitness 19.<//review>

However, upon arrival we saw that a lot of people were not wearing masks at all. I can understand lowering the mask to take a breather after a heavy set, but not having a mask altogether is not acceptable. Also when we asked a staff member about it, she said that they take wearing masks very seriously while a couple of people walked in front of us without masks. She did not say anything to them lol. We left without even taking the tour.< /text><Rate>1<//Rate><user_name>Neel B</user_name><UserId.>103482499847915944546<//UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80dd2c0efbcb326d:0x5a48d772f730dd05<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Came back after my gym membership account unfroze and covid settling down a lot. Called in to make sure whether or not there was a procedure for coming back from a frozen account. JD responded and was very friendly and told me that I'd have to sit down with them to review my plan and that was pretty much it. 5 hours later, I got a call that I didnt recognize and it was actually JD who took time out of her hands to call me again to check up on me in confirming the time I would come today. I was quite amazed actually because of this. Today I officially came in, they offered an In body test that checks your BMI and sheeesh I guess Im gonna be on that grind again. Overall, I think because of COVID, their customer service has improved a lot and yeah definitely recommend those that are interested. JD seemed very knowledgeable in this field so, recommend her if yall are starting a new journey 🙂< /Text>

The staff is enthusiastic, respectful and helpful. I found I could avoid the crowds during certain hours, which is nice if you're trying to stay focused on a routine. The gym is always clean and there are no invisible clouds of gym stank. Which is also nice. Parking was never a problem. I think the employees have made this gym a great little gym and I've had a many a good workouts here.</review>

Got a membership at this location in 2016, and have only been there 11 times. In April 2018, moved to Florida, and realized after 2 and a half years, I'm still paying for the membership. Called November 2020 to cancel, was assured it was cancelled, and they billed me this morning. I can't fly to California to cancel the membership, and just want them to stop billing me.</review>

<Text>COVID Update: They kept charging me $70 and wouldn’t communicate why? There was plenty of confusion cause of Covid, so I decided to just cancel my membership. I went in and the front desk attendant wasn’t wearing a mask, and at least two other people walking around didn’t have one on either. I think they need to take it more seriously and I felt assured that I made the right decision after leaving that night.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been using Fitness 19 for about 2 years,  after switching from Gold’s, due to moving. It’s been a great gym, good and clean atmosphere, with all the free weights and machines I could ask for. Can’t beat the price either. Covid shut everything down, so I built my own home gym and sadly had to cancel for now, but no doubt will be back someday. Huge shout out to RAY! for making the cancelation process the easiest, quickest and friendliest experience. Solid guy right there. Dude had me outta there  in 4 minutes! With a refund for continuation fees. Give this man a RAISE!
If you’re debating on whether or not to sign up with Fitness 19, stop and just go sign up now.< /Text>

<Review>I don't recommend this gym because when we cancelled, we were billed our annual fee $100, our  monthly fee $46 and a random  $99 fee for I don't  know what! I've called a few times and the manager at the Buena Park  location is always busy!<//Review><GmapID>0x80dd2c0efbcb326d:0x5a48d772f730dd05< /GmapID><user_id>107528191474528162925< /user_id>< Date>

I like this gym, it's small and private feeling. They have every machine you need to build/shred/firm/tighten/lose whatever your goal is. ☺ However why I prefer this gym over all others is because of the AMAZING Classes that are available! Vanessa is the best!!! Her classes are zoned in perfectly for every need you may have and she's a great Instructor! After each class my body always feels worked out and stretched to my personal limits - while still helping me feel capable to overcome every obstacle that comes next. It's a great balance of a love hate relationship of working out and I keep coming back for more!!! I highly recommend this place and especially jumping into one of Vanessa's classes! ☺< /Review>

<text>Their recording sound great but beware they keep taking fees out after you follow their rules and withdraw In Writing with 30  days notice. They say “don’t worry we won’t do it again “ next month they take double. We made a mistake joining will not do that again. Beware.<//text>< Pictures>

Best gym ever! Staff are all friendly and approachable. Really good classes mornings and evenings.. instructors are great! Kids club is awesome, all the girls taking care of the kids are sooo nice. My kids loved going to the gym. And it's super clean all the time. Unfortunately I had to move and looking for a new gym made me appreciate really how wonderful Fitness 19 Buena Park really is. The price was so good for me and two kids. They made me love the gym and helped me loose 20 lbs! Really going to miss my instructors, staff and friends.. my gym family 💪❤👍<//Text>

This is a non cookie cutter gym meant for heavy hitters and big fellers like myself. If you're serious about building muscle/ losing weight or just getting in shape this is the gym for you. Rob and his manager Israel and great people that are very helpful. 10/10 recommend this gym.< /text>

There were at least eight people with no masks on inside, including one staff member. It was appalling. The staff clearly saw these individuals but did not say anything. People were just a few feet away from each other without masks.</Text>

BEST GYM!! AWESOME STAFF!! CLEAN!! FRIENDLY!! GREAT GYM ENVIRONMENT!! >>>>>>The main difference between this gym and any other gym in the area, is that it is clean and smells great as soon as you walk in! Every morning, I watch them disinfect and clean all the equipment! In doing so this provides a healthy and clean environment for members to come and better themselves, all without that musky gym smell! Stop by and visit JD! She's worked there for 4 years, and knows the ins and outs of the gym, definitely a gal you can trust! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GYM!<//text>

Typical for the times. Billing for services while closed, saying that they sent out notification of reopening, which I never received. I found out about the reopening when I saw the debit on my bank statement.. I won't be recommending this place to anyone.</Review>

<Text>Luv this gym. I’ve been coming here since day one when they opened. It has the equipment I need for all my workouts. The staff here are very friendly/nice/helpful. They don’t interrupt your workouts to try to get u into a training program like other gyms do (to me that’s really annoying since I like to focus on my w/o), but they do offer them when u come in or on ur way out. They also keep all their equipment & bathrooms clean & it doesn’t smell like sweat or stinky armpits like other gyms do (they have their A/C on all the time). Also u won’t see a broken machine for days, they fix them asap. So if you’re looking for a clean, local good gym to get your workouts done, this is the one.</Text>< pictures>

<text>When I first came in I thought it seemed pretty great but when I signed up I was told that I could pay a one time fee for a few training classes and I thought cool. However, they kept charging me, multiple times, I went in to discuss this with them and they couldn't refund me for what I didn't want. All they could do is stop the repeating payments but I still needed to pay for another month after this. I'm a full time student with a part-time job, I'm stuggling keeping up with all my other bills let alone these extra charges.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1552498584825, 'text': 'Hi Savannah~I would like to apologize that you were not properly explained the details regarding your PT agreement and for some reason not given a copy of your agreement that you signed that explains our PT agreement in detail.

<Text>The gym is clean and kept well maintained. My only concern with this place is the shady methods of dealing with guests. Ive noticed that some people are given deals that are supposedly exclusive to them, when in fact, they charge hidden fees to get started. I would be very wary on the location. I understand its a cheap membership but you get what you pay for.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<review>I'm not really a gym person, and I didn't want to change that... but my wife forced me to come in and give it a try. We tried 24 hour fitness and planet fitness. Everything was so dirty and everyone was so unfriendly I thought I was going to get out of this, but alas my beautiful bride persisted. We tried Fitness 19 and let me tell you, that Robert is a splendid young man. I have my first Personal Training session on Tuesday, wish me luck!<//review>< Pics>

I enjoy fitness 19. I used to belong to LA Fitness, then joined fitness on Spring street.  Nice gym, no real perks or atmosphere.  Got all the all gym pass and go to the valley view location.  Staff is super friendly, they are always cleaning and the gym is neat and weights are in the correct spot!  The only thing I miss from LA fitness is the suana.</Text>

Since I started taking the studio classes here at fitness 19 ive really come to see a change in my body. I enjoy the community here the ladies in the zumba are so encouraging. Taking insanity makes me feel great. My jeans are fitting me better then ever. I highly recommend people to take the chance and try the classes out. I know the gym is always clean the restroom look spectacular. Recently noticed how clean their water fountains look. Overall as a ex member of 24hr hands down better equipment, nicer staff, and environment is welcoming.<//Text>

Fairly good gym. Not to many frills. Pretty basic but price is cheap. Not too crowded. No changing rooms or spa/saunas. Classes aren't very good. Usually hit or miss.<//review>

Great place to start and trainers. Also, no locker rooms, so you come to do your work out and leave. There isn't people there all day, so it isn't busy.</review>

These guys will just order you out of workout area 'as they please'.  Literally order you like, 'hey this area is now closed, because we're going to clean, so leave'.  If you're gonna ask your customers to leave an area, who had to schedule to go there to work out to avoid their obnoxious class schedules, at least have some courtesy of saying 'could you' or 'please', not just 'hey leave' type tone and manner.  Perhaps, you should consider setting / sharing fixed cleaning hours (of course there may be some exceptions for incidental issues)< /text>

It's difficult to beat that, especially if you don't need all the fancy extras that a larger gym might offer: longer hours of operation, a changing room, swimming pool, sauna, etc. Having said that, most of the employees here don't seem to give two F's about the people coming through the door, and when it came down to it, I would rather pay the extra $7/month for the 24 Hour Fitness at the mall.</text>< pics>

<Text>I always enjoy my time going to Wendy's. The food is always great when I go. I love getting the spicy chicken sandwich with the spicy nuggets. In my opinion, Wendy's has the best spicy nuggets, and the spicy chicken sandwich. I'd recommend to anyone to go there if you haven't, or if you go there a lot I hope that you keep enjoying the food!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Ordered a simple single, no cheese, they gave me a single with cheese. Took it back and received a double. Smh.....such a waste of food and your money that I had to throw one patty out the window. Seems every time I come there. I dont get it, its a small request! SINGLE, NO CHEESE!< /text>

<review>Ordered the new jalapeno popper sandwich, was not how it was advertised or described. The only thing my dry chicken had on it was bacon, and two jalapeno stems. Wendy's you should be ashamed, if you ran out of the ingredients needed for that sandwich, just say so, I would have ordered something else. But I will say that the fries were fresh and hot.</review>< Rate>

I usually don't eat fast food, but today I was really starving and no time. The line on the drive thru was huge but for my surprise it was so fast I was amazed. The staff works like a orchestra, all synchronized. Thanks for the fast and quality service.< /text>

They ALWAYS forget to add avocado to the avocado salad. I shouldn't have to check every time I order it but low and behold, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It's never there. This is consistently happening at this location and the workers don't even let you know IF they're out of avocado or not they just toss the bad at you and pray you don't check.< /Text>

I did this review a year ago. I just left and we are sitting and eating our food. There is an extra empty fry box in it, which threw us off but we were hungry and just kept eating our food. My husband ordered two sandwiches, he ate one and it was as he wanted. He opens the other and sees it had tomatoes and lettuce, which he asked for there not be. He took a bite anyway just see if he would like it that way and he didn't, so he opens it to take it off and there is an extra bite missing out of the Patty. WTF. Never going back< /text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>It's Wendy's what can you say you know what you're going for. I went for the chili and asked for the onions and sour cream and did not get it, however I'm not upset because I remembered this time to ask for the hot chili sauce which makes the chili just as much better as having it with cheese and onions.  The line was extremely long but I do not think it was due to the staff I believe it was the car in two cars ahead of me that had a long order or a reorder or something but when I got to the window my order was ready to go still just a little bit upset that didn't have any cheese onions I'm chilly but I do get the hot chili sauce if you never had it try it it's amazing<//Review><resp>None</resp><user_name>Porscha Dominguez<//user_name>< rate>

Co-worker and I went through drive thru. There was only 4 cars in front of us which turned into 2 with the way they did things. One car at a time. His meal was perfect. I asked for a 4 for $4 crispy chicken blt meal with no mayo. They asked me at the speaker what sauce I wanted I said BBQ. Pull up and get our food almost immediately. Got home to find mayo on my sandwich and no sauce in the bags. Fries weren't done either. They were very soggy and oily. Next time I'll be sure to check my order before leaving< /Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Ironically i have the same complaint as I had for taco bell the following day. I was not asked if i wanted ketchup nor was any included in my order. So I had no ketchup for my 🍟. Just like i said in my taco bell review, I know i should have requested it, but it's nice when a fast food restaurant employee goes above and beyond the call of duty to ensure thesatisfaction of the customer.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>My wife went into wendys tonight and the staff was laughing and having fun in the back. Drive through was backed uo pretty bad and there was a line inside. Seemed like the lady at the register was taking spmepnes order every 7 minutes and just cared about her phone. Went across the street to Jack in the box and had her food in 5 minutes<//Review>< pictures>

Wendy's is generally pretty solid, and this one is no exception.  I think this was renovated in their latest style in 2016, so this one is in good shape.

Well staffed and reasonable polite, they only lose a star due to turnover of staff, which prior to the reno was pretty stable for a fast food establishment.< /text>

I usually go to the Wendy's in San Leandro by Davis St but they have been getting rude.  So I decided to give this place a shot.  They are so accurate with my order.  It is a relief honestly and they don't hassle me with extra charging with sauce.  Thank you guys for the superb customer service!

Sincerely,
Your newest location fan< /text>

< Review>
When you ask that you will wait to pay until the order is completed and they hand you the order and say it's ready and trust that's complete. Every utensil except the spoon for the chilli lol. I guess a fork and knife will do. Thanks Wendy's< /Review>

Since they revamped, the place is MUCH better to visit.
Sometimes the order is still taken wrong at the drive through, but the staff is generally more polite and professional.</Text>
