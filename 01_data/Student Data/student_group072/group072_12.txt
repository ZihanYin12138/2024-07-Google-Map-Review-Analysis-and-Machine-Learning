Delicious! My husband and I got lobster tempura, calamari skewer, and one ramen to share. Surprisingly more than we could eat! Order was ready early.</Review>

This place hit the spot. Randomly came here because the restaurant I had originally planned on going to was closed. Good find and good eats. First photo was their chicken karaage and the second was their KO. It did not disappoint. Caught the restaurant just after 12:30 during the week. No wait, not too busy. I can only imagine how this place is on the weekends.< /text>

Supper cute spot!! Great food. Only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because it took way too long for the food to come out. And that's not good when you have hungry kids.</Review>

The vegetarian ramen was great- not too salty, bold flavor. Lots of noodles and toppings... But let's be real- this review is for the tempura egg. DAMN. Not since Hawaii have I experienced one as perfected as this. These are magical. The outside had the thinnest crisp of the fryer process, and the inside firm, but soft enough that if you were toothless, you could enjoy it just as much since it practically melts in your mouth. The gooey center when turned upside down was thick enough to be a slow crawl out of its warm white crown. Would drive from San Jose just to get an order of 5-6 of these.<//review>

Possibly the best ramen in SF. They made their own twist and make the ramen slightly different then others, while remaining the traditional Japanese ramen style. Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Review>Large variety of ramen combinations. I would strongly recommend going either before or after typical prime time hours as the location isn't too big. Great for groups of 4 or smaller - the hidden "gem" would most certainly be their chicken karage. So moist and juicy, an interesting and delicious addition to any ramen combo!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBX6ejJrh-0tgKk-jkzd3kEABnTclMPr5i7CM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkA7aD3W9abTs1NQh_Q0Y2AdQ1qJvSs6mwCG8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3YTxEXQb3GR-N9LcQ5qvjIBDdNf9Ikk1MnJw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpocfpZitlhGfepMwnyeyZN4jztiJf7zhGXRg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPClPmx2h6NlvUP-YWNbwYa8fy3h01Kdd97a6Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Time>

KO ramen was delicious. Lots more meat than the usual ramen experience. Maybe cook the ribs a bit longer so they're more tender?< /Text>

<time>1563933861120< /time><Name>Megan P<//Name><Text>I got the jaeger ramen while my boyfriend got the KO and chicken wings. I was unsure if I wanted to pay almost $20 for a bowl of ramen but it was well worth it. The soft boiled egg is coated in panko making it different than anywhere else I've been. The ramen was a great flavorful broth with curry spices added to it. It comes with 4 lamb skewers on top as well. The bowl is huge and I was able to eat this for two meals. I love that the ramen options here are not standard and aren't going to be found anywhere else. It's definitely worth trying out.</Text></record>

No words needed! That’s mind blowing! I had my mouth watering while we were mixing the liquid with the noodles and seafood! It’s was the best ramen I’ve ever tried! Highly recommended!

P.S. we brought food with us up to North Vista Point and had our dinner with a view. I mean almost with a view. Karl was amazing that evening lol if you know what I mean 😅<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I am a bit easy to impress when it comes to Ramen, but this is the first time I finished all of my noodles before I finished the protein (picture has the extra noodles I asked for). Kaiju's ramen dishes have more protein than noodle, so as far as value goes, I'm pretty impressed - I couldnt even finish the ribs in my Chashu ramen!<//text>

<review>Not a fan of this place. I ordered the coconut ramen and there wasn't a trace of coconut or coconut flavor whatsoever. I was so bummed. It was basically just miso soup with noodles and some unseasoned chicken. I'm not one to leave anything on my plate, so I did finish it (with considerable soy sauce and Sriracha added). $50 later... left full, but unsatisfied.<//review>< user_name>

This restaurant is really amazing. My grandmother had the spicy miso tofu-but instead of mixing in the spices they just sprinkled them on top so that they hit the back of your throat and made you choke. Other than that, the restaurant was really amazing. I had the miso tofu, also, but I ordered it not spicy, and it was stellar. The noodles are firm, not mushy, while being fully cooked, and I loved the crunchy fried potato on top. The tofu was pretty good, my only recommendation is for them to chop up the tofu into smaller bits, big chunks are a little bit much to take on. The egg wasn’t really my cup of tea, but my siblings and grandparents assured me that they would take anything I didn’t want, so my grandmother enjoyed my egg in addition to hers. A great ramen bowl for vegetarians is the miso tofu, order it not spicy. I’m not entirely sure about the sushi here, as I did not try any, but I know for sure I like the ramen!</Text>

<username>Roni Dover</username><Review>We arrived as a party of five with three adults and two children (8 and 10). The Ramen was good however the service was non friendly and when I wanted to return my son's dish as he did not like it and barely touched it I got a dry and unfriendly response that 'he already ate some of it' with zero empathy I would expect even if they decide not to reimburse me...

They also have a weird policy that tip is MUNDATORY at 18 percent if you are four or more people. I usually tip and generously but it left kind of a bad taste to have the tip section of the check already filled out for me. They also did not mention that fact about the tip but just pointed me to the menu where it seemed to be in the fine print... Overall was really disappointed as the place has great potential<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>This is some pretty good ramen here. The broth is unique in that it's incredibly strong, and the flavor matches whatever dish you get (for the KO, it tastes like a BBQ). I'm giving it a 4/5 because the noodles are only okay. I enjoyed the meat in the dish, though.</text>< resp>

Cute place and fun fried food but generally speaking sub par quality fish and overly salted broth. The 4+ star ratings here are likely left by young people looking for taste over quality.<//Review>

<review>Only had 1 person working during busy lunch hours on a Saturday. Waitress does not have her priorities straight, doesn't cleans table and seat customers in a timely manner, nor does she pay attention to people when they are trying to order or request for a check.

Constantly avoid eye contact, so she doesn't have to help you. I understand this might be a staffing or budget issue, but she needs to be managed or shown what her priorities are.

Food is good tho, been here every other month for 4 years.

P.s. they don't know how to space out the food, everything such as appetizer and your main course all comes at once so good luck not getting your ramen soggy while you finish your fries or other things.<//review>< date>

<Text>Small place with very good food. Love the oysters, and ramens of course -specially the seafood ones.  I'm always amazed at the waitress  in turn handling so many people and orders in such a professional manner - when I've been there at lunch time they have one waitress only. It gets packed so you  may need to wait for a table, worth it though,  love this place!<//Text>< response>

<review>Seriously though, go here. Since I've brought my girlfriend here she wants to go almost every night. The spicy Kobe Ramen at the top of the menu is awesome and just the right amount of spicy for my taste! My girlfriend likes that one made non-spicy and the K.O.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Not your typical ramen. Most of the items are spicy by default, but you can ask for a non spicy version. Fairly expensive ramen, but that's pretty normal for specialty ramen. Lots of choices to pick from, even a vegetarian option. I would come back just to try the other unique ramen.< /Text>

This spot is young and full of energy (and USF students). Not too pricey for SF, but it is easy to spend a lot of money here - especially if you get some appetizers (get the fries).< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Really good ramen. Had the karaage ramen and it was fantastic. There are not too many tables so may have to wait a bit but was worth it. Also there was only one server there which seemed inefficient and could have done with a second one, but it was a holiday so may have been hard to find people to work. For the situation, service was still good. Will definitely come back again.</Text>< Pictures>

Pros.
1. Rolls are really good.
2. During happy hour all rolls cost $6.

Cons.
1. Waitresses are not freindly.< /Text>

There were also a variety of side dishes, calamari, fried golden pumpkin, and more. The Spicy Miso was good, but I felt that the broth wasn't thick enough, it was really watery. The curry ramen had the perfect amount of thickness in a soup/broth. There is another ramen place that is better than this one, but it's a little far.  It's called the Ramen Parlor in San Mateo, it's always crowded there.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Do not understand why people giving this place 4 or 5 stars for ok ramen. This place is just ok. I had the chicken karaage ramen and broth was super light. Yes its a soy broth ramen but it tasted bland. Mostly just added spicy oil over it. They only give you half a boil egg and sprouts as well. It is missing bamboo shoots, mushroom, scallions and even sea weed. Perhaps the skewed meats would be a better choice. It is also pricey for an ok place. My friend had the spicy miso ramen expecting thin slices of chasu pork but instead got cut up pieces of pork. The pork was mostly fatty parts and seemed like it was boiled and not roasted for hours. Its also a bit pricey for these types of ramen. The creations are a bit weird. Music playing in background are pop music and a bit loud. $19 for a pitcher of Sapporro? Also there was a weird smell or some of odor while we were waiting for a table.< /Text>

I had the vegetarian ramen and thought it was delicious and flavorful. I don't love super spicy food, but I thought this had a good amount and wasn't bland. I went for lunch and we were seated right away (2 people) and food was brought out within 10 minutes (we both had ramen).< /Review>

<Review>Gluten free options on the Ramen: you can choose from Miso Tofu (spicy), Coconut Chicken (mild), or one other option, with either buckwheat or yam noodles. I had Miso Tofu with buckwheat and it was delicious. First time I've ever had Ramen, would definitely go again!!</Review>< Pics>

A small place and a bit busy for weekday lunch. A little pricey for what it was. The spicy karaage had some giant pieces of chicken, but it didn't have the traditional japanese flavour. The broth was a bit salty. I assume this is a fusion spot. Service was understaffed for lunch.< /review>

<text>Good: This place has an ok ambiance for a tiny place.

Bad: The ramen is not good at all, Genki Ramen or Halu Ramen are way better choices if you care about a great tasting ramen and only a few more blocks away. There are always tiny flies that are hovering over your food.</text>< Pics>

Food is always good but the service is absolutely awful. Every time (yes I come back because it's close to my office And the food is good) the girl is really rude and acts like I'm bothering her. I think it's because I take it Togo and she knows her tip isn't going to be as big as a dine in...</Text>

I enjoyed this place a lot! It strays a lot from traditional Japanese, but I thought the liberties taken felt mostly appropriate and made it a must try. The edmame was great. The karaage ramen was fantastic. I am, however disappointed in the KO ramen (their version of tonkotsu ramen). The ribs did not taste very marinated and the eggs were not marinated at all! That's two of the most important elements of tonkotsu ramen! The noodles, pork belly, and broth we're all still very rich and delicious, so still a good dish. I was also disappointed in the gyudon, since the rice was purely white, meaning bit didn't have any of that delicious broth soaked into it. The onions were also undercooked. The flavor of the beef was still sweet and scrumptious though. I got the vibe that the restaurant's less traditional dishes are where it shines. I'd definitely try it again.</text>

<Date>1430514619783< /Date><review>I am kind of over the ramen craze, but this place was actually surprisingly good. I got the Kaiju ramen, which was very flavorful. The tortilla chips seemed pretty strange, but I ended up being glad that there was some crunchy texture added to the bowl. I like spicy food, but this one was a bit too spicy. I felt like I was coughing during half the meal. All in all, a good meal, and I would come back and try something different!< /review>< Rating>

Service was atrocious, food was average. Had the KO ramen, noodles we're ok, the meat was sub standard. Also had the spicy butterfish sushi which was good if you wiped off the excess mayo. Not really sure the appeal of this place. I guess the draft beer is cheap...</review>

This place has some of my favorite ramen in the city. I've been here several times and can only speak for their ramen (haven't tried anything else on the menu). It has been hit or miss for if there's a wait but service is generally pretty fast. Would recommend their $11-14 ramen choices over the more expensive ones<//Text>

4/5 Stars in 2017: Kaiju has definitely improved on food and service. Fusion ramen was pretty good, especially for a neighborhood joint. Prices seem high, but reasonable considering ingredients and the size of each bowl. Happy hour deals look good too.

2/5 Stars in 2015: Perhaps it was just bad timing and too high of expectations, but I came here and had a less than mediocre experience. Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm by myself with no lines and no wait. Having heard that the fusion ramen was amazing, and seeing as the weather was a drizzly, I was more than ecstatic to try this place. Unfortunately, according to the staff, they ran out of many if the seafood and their shipment had not arrived yet, so there were no oysters, no uni, and no crab or lobster for the lobster tail and crab leg ramen. After all of my top choices were shot down, I opted for the Wasabi Chirashi, made tempting by their facebook cover photo. Unfortunately, since there was a lack of seafood, my chirashi had a few missing ingredients. The fish didn't seem too fresh, but by this point, my tummy was too hungry to argue with my brain. About half way through my meal, the kind waitress remembered she didn't serve me any tea or water, even though the place didn't get any busier after I had arrived.

Overall, meal was mediocre, though my disappointment may be heavily biased on my eagerness to try the ramen here... I'll give this place another try perhaps, though probably not anytime in the near future.<//review>

amazing ramen, but watch out, they have a limited amount of food per day.

Went there one day and said they would run out by the time i sat down (it was about 7pm when I went)

the appetizers are AMAZING too< /Text>

I went Sunday after 7pm. this place is not a big place. maybe 10 tables. it was almost packed but maybe I came good time in a day. right away, seated and ordered in 2 mins. I ordered tataki (seared white tuna) and asari (clam with soy based broth) tataki came on hot plate which I haven't seen it served that way before. they put crispy rice between and source they put taste really good. not sure if white tuna is super fresh since tataki is supposed to be seared but taste good! asari ramen was delicious too. soup taste light. not too oily like tonkotsu. not no-taste like shio. just about right. lots of clams on top. usually these kinda thing, it's hide and seek. you really need to find clams underneath off noodle or hiding under seaweed but here it's carpet of clams. you see them there surely. only one thing, made me waaat? is noodle. I know there are many ramen noodle types and this one is good with miso broth kinda thing but what I found in my asari ramen was spaghetti. well, it wasn't pasta but I saw spaghetti in my ramen. I tasted spaghetti in my ramen. I had spaghetti with chopsticks. it was almost they are closing but the server wasn't pushy like "eat-leave-dont-review-us-here-but-5-stars-please." she was nice (but seemed wanna get off work right now.) I definitely come back there. it was delicious!<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The best tuna tataki of my life. Ramen, however, very messy, with even sauces. There is only half a boiled egg and I don't really like it as a choice. Pasty noodles inside, overcooked. Beautiful and well-kept location. Staff ok.

(Original)
Il tataki di tonno più buono della mia vita. Il ramen però molto pasticciato, con addirittura salse. C’è solo una metà uovo sodo e non mi piAce molto come scelta. Noodles pastosi all’interno, stracotti. Location bella e curata. Personale ok.< /Review>

Mail man was scheduled for 3 pm arrived hrs before . I was expecting my new license now with no proof of identity I can't pick it up. How am I supposed to prove it's me. How about arrive when you say you are to insure customer is at home/location. Now I'm f%©®Ed . Thanks wonder why they are going under. Bring back the pigeon carriers</Text>

Excellent customer service , when I arrived there was a line of 6 people, I thought it will take a lot of time but I just had to wait less than 5 minutes. Clean and social distancing protocols are followed.<//Text>

I recently moved and forwarded my mail to my new address. I noticed I haven’t received a package I’ve been waiting for. I called USPS couldn’t get through to an actual person and looked up the tracking number and all I could get for a response was “Disposed by post office”? No reason why, they didn’t pay for the item, nothing. And I couldn’t get through to an actual person to ask why?! Very unprofessional, and unethical.</text>

It's a post office, folks. If it were all glamorous you would complain about the feds squandering our tax dollars. Its functional and the people who work there are polite and doing their best to keep up with the work load. My favorite service (which doesnt seem to be available all the time) is when the clerks come out to the lobby with the portable scanner. They are able to process flat-rate mailers for people who can pay with a credit card using the scanner. They get people in and out of line incredibly fast when they do this. If I had a complaint or suggestion it would only be that they offer this all the time.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>As a previous employee here I can contest that we do a lot of work here at this location and it’s not just the mail man that do work. We are here from midnight to sometimes 8pm doing our best to get everyone their mail as well as dealing with fed ex and UPS dropping off their stuff that they’re too lazy to deliver as well as amazon. While everyone is home on sundays enjoying family time we’re here still working to get amazon shipments out the whole day. So always remember that it’s not just letters and priority packages that come through these doors. Sometimes we mess up and make mistakes and we’re human and yeah sometimes there are those bad apple clerks that carry a grudge but we’re not all like that! I loved that office and the people I worked with and the customers I got to help on a daily!! Can this office clean up and knock some bad apples out of the branch? Of course! But in the end we do our best to make everything run smoothly.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I go there daily for work. They all know my name and treat me like I'm important. If I just need a certified dropped off, they take care of it without making me wait in line.< /Text>

Customers have a long wait in line inside a small area. Hard to get to mailing supplies, in a place where you have to try to get around people standing in line, that think you're trying to cut in front of them. People in line were complaining about cards always left in their mail boxes without attempt to deliver packages or special delivery mail. Those working at the counter seemed to be doing their best to help, however smiles might have helped relax some of the tension. Seeing how many had delivery pickup cards, I think they would do well to have a dedicated line always available for those customers.</review>

The worker Jasmine was very rude to me on the phone when I was trying to see if I could pickup my package instead of having it delivered to my address. She told me the link was on their website and when I couldn’t find it and called back to see where on the website it was located she didn’t even know how to do it or where it would be on their website and proceeded to speak in a rude manner saying that they were busy etc.< /Text>

<text>Very small waiting area. There is a clerk working the floor to help alleviate the long line. Very often the wait is out of the building. Most of the staff have a great attitude while others suck. I go there every week cause it's the closest and not because it's better. I like 18 th street PO better. It's too far though.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

We recently had an apt fire and are displaced as of now so we opted to have our mail held for 30 days at this location. We went on Tues. and filled out the necessary form, on Thurs. I went to pick up whatever mail they had for me and was told that no such hold existed so i had to fill out another form and was told the hold was now in effect although when i walked away the woman just threw the paper on the side of the counter. Not to mention her bad customer service, no eye contact or smile, popping and chewing gum like a cow, and a rushing attitude.</Review>

I don't understand my postal carrier having my package "out for delivery" at 10:22 am saturday the 25th and then at 5:31 pm the same day the status is changed to AVAILABLE FOR PICKUP. No slip was left saying "Attempted to deliver" - never mind the fact that I was home the ENTIRE DAY waiting on the package or that regular junk mail was delivered.
Someone please explain why my "PRIORITY" package wasn't a priority to my carrier and how the hell they expect me to forward their job and go pick it up???
If Zero stars were available, they wouldn't get this one star rating.</text>

I asked, called, went to the post office to get information and even talked to my mail carrier but all I got was we are short staff do to Halloween and your mail carrier was out for 2 days.. package was sent back to the sender after 3 days of not knowing where or who's mail car was in. Till today 11-08-16 they still can't find it!!  Denise was very rude and not helped at all. I asked to be transfer to a supervisor but she said there was none, she said "there is no one here".

Horrible experience!
I had accidentally sent a package I ordered to my old address and called them to forward the package to my new address. (Had already did a change of address but called just in case). I spoke to a person named Celia and explained my situation to her. I gave her my information, tracking number, and still she would not to forward my own package to my new address. She  abruptly hung up the phone in the middle of our conversation. She was unprofessional and rude.</Text>

<Review>Many occasions where the mail person deliver our mails to our neighbor's mailbox, my check went missing, many old mail was received way late, mailman deliver our mails when he wants to. Sometimes he would drive down our court and bust a u turn and out not even stopping. Made many complaints and Denise hang up on me, told me if neighbor where stealing my mail then report to their investigator. She didn't allow me to finish nor try to understand the problem. Even Cilia just said don't block your mailbox which I clearly made sure nothing or cars are not park in front of my mailbox. Just horrible customer service. They don't take blame for nothing or even put effort to fixing the issues. I was advised by Cilia that if I don't have any incoming mail then they don't have to pick up my mail in the mailbox (then what the hell is a mail person or mailbox is for then?). Very frustrating dealing with this post office.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

PURE INCOMPETENCE! They've misplaced my package in the wrong box twice already, and recently, my package was not delivered. When I called to know the status of my delivery, the guy told me that it was left behind at the main office, that's why the online tracking still says Out for Delivery. Just a bunch of incompetent idiots working at this post office. And these guys are paid with our tax dollars! Complete idiots!</Text>

(Translated by Google) Excellent service, almost all the staff is very friendly, plus almost the majority of the time all the service is very fast, and that's good because you do not expect to spend hours at the post office doing line, also have some options that help you so that your visit is much faster!

We just purchased a truck from this location and ALL the staff from owner to salesman were amazing,friendly, and professional! Scott and Art made the whole buying process stress free! A lot of car dealers take long and are just in it to scam you but not Extreme Cars & Trucks! I highly recommend purchasing from them! This company met all our needs/desires for our purchase and went the extra mile to work with us on what we wanted upgraded on our vehicle as well!!<//Text>

I bought a car here about three years ago and when I needed a new car, I knew I could come back and get great customer service. I came in on a Sunday and was able to trade in my car and get a new one easily. Gary made the process simple and convenient for me. I will continue to come back whenever I need a new car!</review>

<review>All of the staff was extremely helpful and were able to work with me on pricing and financing. They don't have the biggest selection on cars and trucks but they have just enough to put you in whatever you're looking for. I would definitely buy another car there and would/will recommend to others in the future.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the best car buying experience we have ever received. We weren't rushed or pressured into buying anything, they worked with us, were very patient and met our standards. Lastly, we drove away with a happy ending in our new truck. Thank you Gary & Saul. We'll be back!< /Text>< pics>

The workers are great. But brian white is not the person to seek help from. I have a tap and pay credit card and i was gng to purchase a 2007 honda civic. And had the money on card. But right away no. And to top it off either him or sales person was snooping thru my phone personal stuff. So why uld they be gng thru my person apps. Makes me wonder if they are trying to get info on me.</review>

When you start the review it says, "what did you like?" Well I liked everything not a single complaint with extreme. I was looking at one truck, thought it may be a deal and realized it wasn't the motor I wanted. They didn't have any other trucks on the lot that matched what I was looking for. We talked some more as a sales associated checked out their second location. We took a drive to the second location found the truck I wanted brought it back to their riverside office crunched some numbers and now I have a truck I love with payments I can afford. These are a great group of people and I would recommend them any day of the week! Thank you Extreme Auto!!< /text>

My wife and I came in and from the time we got on the lot just browsing, until the iMedRIS we left with a beautiful Nissan Versa, they did everything they could to accommodate our limitations, and we left happy, paying what we set out to pay. I have no complaints. Go see these guys, they'll set you up nice< /review>< time>

I was able to get the car I really wanted and I'm happy with my car. I made sure to do research prior on what car I wanted. I definitely like this car better than the rest of my old cars. 🙂<//Review>

This is a great dealership that treats their customers needs and wants well. They are friendly and help you come to a decision you feel very happy about. They take the time to explain things you don't understand and move at your pace. Jerson was very helpful in every way defiantly will be recommending them family and friends.< /text>

<review>They made me drive 2 hours away to check out a truck because they wouldn't tell me the price over the phone. I get there but the truck isn't because it blew a cylinder. I ask what the price is, which KBB'd at 11k-13k, and they're asking $23k for an '06 with 115k miles on it. Definitely not worth it.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><user_id>108537643002976441045</user_id><gmapID>0x80dcb0f7f9c7d59b:0x1116cd4db9af8b15<//gmapID><username>Alex Limbaugh< /username><Rate>1<//Rate><time>1492301795608</time></record></dataset><record>

She called and asked why she hadn't received it. I apologized and explained to her I was on emergency leave and gave her my commands contact information so she could verify it. For the next week I received nothing but threats from her. Then on top of that when she finally received the check she needed my signature but refused to meet me halfway on a three hour drive because she was going on vacation. She had no problem harrassing me though. I understand she need her money but I gave her way to much information to have been treated like a fraud.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

This marks my second truck purchasing from Extreme, George was our salesman this last time, he sold us a 2009 GMC Sierra which was absoluty beautiful.  He did a great job.  Also wanted to note that Brian the manager is amazing, the truck had a few minor things that need attention and he took care of us....thanks EXTREME!<//review>

Horrible customer relations... left them a message regarding a truck i was interested in and when i was finally contacted, was left a message saying the truck was on the lot with a fresh oil change, etc., etc. When i finally talked to a person, i asked what they wanted for the truck- and all i got was the runaround about how "the boss has the numbers and he's busy" and "well, the truck is actually with the mechanic now, getting an oil change....etc., etc." What??? I thought it was on the lot and all ready to go? So then i tell him i have a trade in and he says to bring it down to get me a value on it and again- if i don't know the price of the truck i like- why go all the way from Pomona to Redlands? ALL I WANTED WAS THE PRICE..... that way we both know if it's worth a shot at making a deal. So he ends up saying that his boss has the numbers on the truck and that when it gets back to the lot, he'll call me. That was last weekend. That must be a helluva oil change.... complete b.s. Get back to your potential customers and quit acting like the price on a vehicle is top secret information.....< /Text>

I was going through a Lemon Law with my 2015 Jeep Patriot and they got together an awesome deal for me that I couldnt refuse.

I got the car that I wanted- Nissan Xterra and they cut my payments and my loan in half.
I worked with Bryan and Jerson. They were so awesome to me. I will totally go back to them for another vehicle. I have horrible credit and they did everything for me. I love my SUV!
Thanks you guys.</review>

<review>I had my laundry dropped off to be washed and when I received it back my towels were stained with a substance I couldn't identify.  In addition, many of my clothes were missing including my underwear, two robes, three tops, and three pairs of jeans. When I brought this to the managers attention, she told me they would wash the towels over, but they would not return my missing items. I asked to speak to the owner, but they refused.  I told them I would report them to the Better Business Bureau and the woman told me she did not care.  Not only did they ruin my laundry, they literally stole my clothes and refused to return them.  If you're considering using Tsunami Wash, BEWARE.  They steal and the customer service is horrible.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<review>So, I went and did five loads of laundry here last week.  Got there about 8:15 and washed and dried all my stuff.  Attendant at the time was male and never said a word to me, just folded his laundry service stuff and did his thing.  Nothing super impressive about the place but functional, change machine works, etc.

Well, tonight my husband went to do one load of laundry, two small blankets to be exact.  The location lists its hours as closing at 9:30.  He looked this up because I thought they closed at nine and he wasn’t going to head there at 8:18 if they closed at nine because he is a conscientious consumer.  He made the four minute drive there and the female attendant on duty told him the last wash is at 8pm.  He said, I only have these two small blankets (think of a fleece couch throw) and they only need washed and not dried.  Keep in mind it is 830 which is an entire hour before they close.  And she refused to let him wash these blankets.  When he walked outside, she flipped the sign to closed.

So he drove a few minutes farther tonight.  As we will every single time we do laundry from here on.  I spent almost $40 there my first trip and I do laundry like that about twice a week.  But I won’t support unreliable practices and wonder if this was racially motivated.  I can’t imagine what made the difference between me doing laundry last week and him this week otherwise.< /review></record>

<Review>I just went yesterday, and found that one of my expensive blouses was ruined with bleach stains. I DO NOT use bleach; especially not on my delicates. My husband said he saw one of the staff pour bleach into several machines; possibly having bleach poured into ours as well. I have never had this issue anywhere else;  it's not my first time at this facility but it's definitely my last.</Review>< pics>

Very clean. Great machines!!  Multiple-load machines. The woman who works there is wonderful.  She's there to maintain the laundry room and handle the fluff and fold part of the business but is always willing to help you with something - even help you fold your sheets. :) .Shes a gem!!</review>

Helpful staff. They will do wash and fold for you. Big and small machines that work. You can buy detergent there and prices are reasonable. Nice clientele. Wash takes approx. 22 minutes. Can't say about the dryers, I don't use them.< /Text>

The woman who manages the place is an absolute dream she's wonderful but that is as far as it goes. In my entire life I have never been to such a terrible laundromat if you lose your money in the machines good luck getting it back if you forget a load Awash good luck getting that back as they throw all the things that people forgot that day underneath the folding table for the homeless now I'm for the homeless to have clothes but I think you should at least wait 24 hours like I happen to be handicapped...... it's not clean the kids are not manageable I don't have a good thing to say about it all !!! I would rather wash my clothes in the gutter then to ever go back to this terrible terrible place!!!!¡</text>

The current staff are very friendly, personable, and helpful. I have been coming here for about a year, and the staff are always hard at work and conscientious about keeping the laundromat clean. I have NEVER seen the staff try to close earlier than the posted time.  Customers should respect the hours of operation and plan their day accordingly.<//review>

<review>I definitely don't recommend doing laundry here unless is a significant emergency. They have NO AC! Imagine having to do laundry with a weather of 117 degrees - I don't know how the employees manage to work here in those conditions.

The place is very dirty, bathroom is always filthy, machines are not that great. In general, the place has tons of potential  to provide decent business, but is not being taken care of. Feels very ghetto and uncomfortable to do your laundry here. I just found out there are nicer laundry places in the area, would definitely consider other options.

If you don't mind this kind of place, then it would do the job, but for another type of clientele, this place is not worth it!

Only positive is the staff, very friendly and helpful :)< /review>< pictures>

If you must do laundry, in my opinion this is the place in Palm Springs, staff was very helpful and courteous, for a fee will launder and fold your clothes for you, or if you rather they offer self service coin operated washers and dryers. change and vending machine for laundry soap on premises, conveniently their is a grocery and drugstore in the same shopping center.< /review>

< review>
This place was ONCE, a long time ago, a nice and friendly place to do laundry.  Now they have 12 year old staff who are rude, 'bitchy but with a smile', and open and close the place whenever they feel like it.  It makes you wonder if there is a Owner/Manager at all.

As an example, I had put two loads of laundry in at 6:40 PM and still had 2 more to start.  At 7:02 PM, as a courtesy, I asked the 12 year old they had on duty if I could still start my other 2 loads.  She looked at me and with a huge fake smile said "The last loads have to be in by 7:00 PM."  I told her they were short washes, and pointed out that with 20 min to wash and 30 to dry that I'd be out by 7:45 PM.  She simply said "The last loads have to be in by 7:00 pm and anyway, I'm closing early tonight."

So apparently the teenage staff get to choose when they open and close based on how tired they are or their social schedule for that evening.  That's a pretty shi#%y way to run a business.

To make my irritation clear to this teenager, even knowing she was wanting "to leave early", I stayed until exactly 8:00 PM  and folded every item of my laundry, even with her asking me when I wold be done and her pacing around the place impatiently waiting for me to leave.

As a general business practice, if your posted business hours are 7:00 AM to 8:00 PM then you should hire responsible people who can tell time and not rush paying customers out of the place early just so they can duck out ahead of time to party on a Friday night!

A warning to all - - double check the hours for that day before you go, as you start your laundry and during the washing and drying cycles because these children they have running the place make up the hours as the night goes along.

Thankfully I found a MUCH better laundromat just a few miles away with vending machines, a swamp cooler, and a TV.  Look up Thrifty Wash at Rimrock Center on Hwy 111, near Gene Autry.  MUCH better facility!!!</review>

Always extremely hot.  No A/C or swamp cooler running.  Rude staff. Closes at 8PM.  Why?   Sad this is only option in Palm Springs.< /Text>

this place doesn't seem to care about their customers. I started going because my usual laundry closed down last year- but now I'm moving on because its bad enough they are over priced- now they are rude and don't have time for customers<//text>

This Subway has had a friendly staff every time I've came. It offers comfortable cushion seating and it is somewhat spacious between the tables. You can order your food ahead of time online in case you are short on time. The times I did order online, my order came out perfect with no mistake. This is possibly my favorite Subway from the others in the area.</review>

Is this a franchised location? I went today on a pretty warm day about 78-80° outside and let me tell you, it was HOT inside, also a bit humid. The poor staff members have to endure that heat for 8 hours, I Asked one of them if their A/C was broken and they told me that they weren't allowed to use the A/C. Absolutely unsafe working conditions which can cause heat stroke or some major fatigue. I would also assume a kitchen environment would need some kind of ventilation.</text>

<Review>I don’t know if it was the owner or just a prune. She refused to let me and my wife remove and add condiments like we always do to our foot long Turkey subs. Also we asked for toasted she didn’t, and the sub wasn’t even cut in half. We didn’t do anything she had an attitude from the get go. Moral of the story, don’t bring your problems to work and work to home.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Very bad i ask for a simple cup to drink the water that i bough from the market and they would not give me. I purchased a footlong sandwich. The worst part they act like their your friends because customers pay for people to have jobs and im a customer for both subways. Justice will be serve someday to all those dumb assess.</Text>

I thought maybe I'm talking quietly but then the lady behind me told him her order & I heard her perfectly say about 3 times she wanted tuna & he goes "what?? Just cheese??" And only put cheese on her sandwich and she told him again I want tuna and he's like do you want any meat? She already had said tuna a bunch of times! If he really can't hear sorry he shouldn't be working there! then the girl working (didn't get her name) finally was ringing up the lady infront of me & they said they had no change to give her for a 20 ???? Like what ??? They just wanted to be rude . poor lady barely even spoke english .</Text></record>

<Text>Nice comfortable furniture... Never seen this in any other Subway.
Took off two stars because I was unable to use their restroom because they claim someone locked the key inside. Can't believe they dont have a spare.</Text>< Response>

I came here to try and eat healthy, but theres flies all over the food and condiments. How is that eating healthy? Employee with the blonde afro seemed real careless and messy with the orders. This place is disgusting. Definitely not the grade A posted on the window. I will report this to the health department as they are not meeting food industry standards with sanitation.< /text>

Stayed a couple nights in the off season at campground #2. Site was flat and relatively dry, fire pit, electric and water on the camp site. The showers and restroom were clean with plenty of hot water. RV residents swung by to help with my fire and recommended several local beaches. Great base camp for Redwoods National Park.< /Review>

Absolutely outstanding service,very clean,and very friendly , welcoming staff and nieghbors. Perfect location as all of your getaway needs are very close by;the ocean,the rivers ,or if you're like us there are many casinos in the area all of which are pretty welcoming and clean. Definitely worth every penny spent.  Just gotta say it;the owner and Manger Sean is a really good person as well.</Text>

<Review>I stayed in one of their cabins for a week back in April 2011 and loved it! Next time I visit the area, I will definitely choose this place again. Absolutely cozy, charming, and refreshing. Very close to Patricks Point, Sumeg Village and Redwood National & State Parks.<//Review><UserId.>109349334425674619524< /UserId.>< Rate>

The people who run this place are very friendly and accommodating!  Although we had reservations, we decided not to stay there.  We were out for a drive and checked the place out and it was super tight and congested.  We have a dually truck to haul our 5th wheel and we could barely drive it down the road past campers because people parked on the street.  This was because they didn't have a spot to park their vehicle on their site!< /Text>

Best place to stay whether in a tent, RV, or renting a cabin. You can keep your boat on the property if you have one with you. Fish cleaning stations are available. Very nice and clean park. Pets have the perfect place to do their duties.< /review>

Leaving an artificially low review since the current average 4.7 is unreasonably high in my opinion.  I probably would've left a 4 as there weren't any huge issues and the experience matched the price. Service was great, although I made my reservation 3 months in advance and received a dozen or more emails changing which site I was assigned to. Facilities are old and rustic which may be charming for some. Felt a little lazy to me, but the price is fair. Our site was pretty tight to pull into including no picnic table or really even space for chairs. Neighbor was a 5 year resident and filled me in on the park drama without prompting. She at least caught the hint that I wasn't listening after awhile.< /Review>

I liked the website it was very honest about the space available and the price. The price was reasonable and the staff though sometimes hard to find were friendly. The only critique I have is it looks like nothing has been updated in a VERY long time.</Review>

Very nice, friendly, scenic RV park. Just stopped by for a charge for my Nissan Leaf, with a nearly empty battery. The manager got me an adapter to go from Nema 14-50 to their 50A 250V hookups. Thanks!< /text>

<Text>we broke down in their driveway, stayed longer than intended, and in spite of all the bad luck these people made our stay worthwhile.

we are full time rv'ers, and will stay there again, if and when we got back to that area.  i DON'T stay anywhere twice, given my choice.

i liked them so much i'd almost offer you a money back guarantee for their park.</Text>< pics>

<Text>OMG, this lady is crazy. She tried to bully me into accepting HER changes to MY reservation. VERY poor customer service, the customer is always WRONG in her mind and she thinks you will put up with anything. I didn't want to share my holiday time with some crazy stranger.</Text>< pictures>

<review>This is an Elks member only park, as is typical of Elks Lodge RV facilities. Graveled, level, shaded, full hookups sites. The lodge remains closed during COVID restrictions. I was met by the camp host and was able to preview any campsite of my choosing. I needed to disconnect my car hauler and was directed to a location to park it. $25/night for the campsite and $5/night for the trailer.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
Visiting from another lodge.  Went for Sunday Breakfast.  Met some new friends and enjoyed a great Breakfast Burrito  and biscuits and gravy.  If you are an elk passing through, highly recommend stopping and enjoying their hospitality.  If you are not an Elk, think about joining!!!<//Review>

Now I'm not a member of the elks, but have had the opportunity to come here on numerous occasions. I'm not sure if membership is a requirement but if you want a nice quiet place for a drink look no further, reasonably priced and like I said a nice quiet place. They do have hambuer dinners and other events monthly and yearly. My wife and I actually rented the little dining room for our daughter's sweet 16, again not a member but the help and prices were very good. Check out the Simi Valley Elks Lodge. And who knows you may just find yourself wanting to be a member.< /text>

Hard to find,  being at the very back of a flag lot; minimal parking.  Great if you're an Elk but membership is too expensive for me. They are wonderfully supportive of our Marine Corps League Detachment 597 & make some of the best hamburgers I have ever had!<//review>

I love round table and this is my go-to location. Prices aren’t cheap compared to the other pizza chains around, but the quality is far higher than any other chain I know of. The staff here are also very very friendly... especially when you order a lot from them! 10/10 customer service and 10/10 pizza. I moved cities recently but if you’re in San Jose looking for good pizza make sure to visit the round table on Camden and Kooser</Review>

Round Table makes a great pizza. They forgot to deliver the salad. I called and in a few minutes my salad arrived. Delivered by the person taking orders on the phone. She told me that she didn’t want me to wait for normal delivery.</text>

When we arrived there wasn't anyone at the hostess station desk to help us get a seat.
We stood there for several minutes and actually had to flag someone down to even notice we were there.
Once we were seated the wait staff was in a hurry to the point that they were very impatient and forgot several items on our order.
The quality of the food was good and the quantity was excellent.
The chips were awesome.
Maybe they were just to busy and under staffed?
I'd return just to see if that was the case....<//text>

<Review>This place offers a very decent buffet for $10, $4 more gets you a soft drink.  If you've been to Mountain Mike's for their buffet, it's very similar but for a few bucks more you're getting a little more such as cinnamon twist bread (yum!) Garlic cheese bread twists, lots of different types of pizzas put out regularly, generous offerings of potato and macaroni salad in their salad bar, a dessert cookie pizza (I didn't get to try it was too full) lots of dressing types and salad toppings, place was clean, kids have a designated play area in a separate attached room, TVs on display, sports and kid friendly channels, asked for puzza sauce on side and they were a bit stingy on this but didn't charge me.  Overall, I would come back again although I think Mountain Mike's has tastier pizza.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>We like this round table because it's relatively clean and has an indoor play space which is nice when it's raining out, or I want air conditioning.  We've also had parties here and the employees have been pretty friendly and helpful.  However be aware this place can be a mad house on the weekends so I generally come during the week when it's much less crowded.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>This place need a good remodel and cleaning the kids area was a good idea but it was smelly and dirty . There was employee there in the back but yet I only seen I Hispanic Lady clean up the bathrooms and she did a very good job in.

<review>The pizza is usually good, if a little greasy. The staff is friendly and the place is clean and always smells good. A great place to go if you're craving pizza!</review><gmapID>0x808e345c973ba5f9:0x2929c406fb974b5b<//gmapID>< pictures>

<review>If I could give this place less than one star for it's customer service I would. Today we went with a party of 12-14 people for their buffet. The manager Jr. Banez was extremely rude to us. We reached around 12:50 and by the time we decided what we wanted the buffet, it was around 1.07. We went to order and he told us he will only be making one more pizza which is in the oven. He said he buffet closes at 1:30, and we were late. We said we still have 20 minutes, but he was not willing to accommodate us by making more pizza. He even asked me whether I knew "how to run a business or not," something that I've never heard any professional businessman say to their customer. Rest assured, I will never visit this Round Table again, and I strongly recommend that you don't either.</review>< pics>

<Review>So customer service was great but bathrooms were closed for cleaning while there was 30 people in here. They could have at least cleaned bathrooms closer to closing. A big no no I saw was the kid spraying the glass over the salad bar with windex so I did not get to go back for seconds which was a bummer:(</Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Poorly balanced AC - part of the building warm, and part freezing. Needs redecorating. For these pizza prices, need to try harder.< /review>

<Review>I love round table, but this location has very surly, unhappy, and unhelpful people.  I arrived to pick up an order that I had asked to be ready and was told I would have to wait a half hour for the pizza.  When I insisted that I had called, the "manager" meagan told simply snarled at me, "I don't know what do you expect me to do?"
I expect some customer service for 50 bucks worth of pizza!  At least a little here would have gone a long way.  I got my refund, no apology from the sour woman and will not  be returning to this location.< /Review>< name>

<text>Very expensive, but the best pizza around. This store has about 25 plasma tv's and is always jumping. Pizzas are fresh and tasty! Don't go to the Kooser store...its privately owned and quality is way down when it comes to taste. Update: my last 5 visits have been cause to lower a star in my rating. Pizzas have been overcooked and dry. Additionally, the staff (knowing I was there waiting) placed my pizza in the warmer and only when I asked 15 minutes later did they discover that they were in there...Pizza was not fresh and this was the 2nd time this has happened... no offer for a discount or redo... Please get that quality back to where it was! ***Update again*** it's been about 6 months since last review and quality of the pizza is back! The only drawbacks are, again, the price and that they are very difficult when you try to get them to honor coupons to defray the high price......They didn't want to honor the coupon on my phone because apparently they don't have a scanner.... Not really a good reason to not honor a coupon... I'm sure they can just hit a key...anyway, long review but at least you can see the updates...</text></record>

So far so good! Super friendly. I needed my prescription from another optometrist and they called to have it faxed over. That saved me a trip! Glasses incoming, I'll keep ya posted Google!😀😆😅<//Review>

After taking my insurance's monies,and  my money, I won't patronize the establishment a second longer.  As a Veteran I've been many places and this team is one of the most unprofessional I've seen. Reminiscent of a storefront in Iraq. They tell you one thing and it's entirely something else.  Duped. Beware. I'll probably never get my glasses now with this. That is money taken away with no product. When ask if I could have a tangible copy of my prescription.  Wow! Printer's down. Filed a formal complaint. They should not have the right to do whatever with my money and they wont.<//text>

Been going here for a few years and I have always been helped with nothing but kindness. Doctors care about the patient and don’t just try to rush you in and out. One of the best up here<//Text>

<Text>I would highly recommend this place! I broke my glasses at work I called them the next day to see if we could do anything and they told me to come in to fit my lenses in a new pair. I was in and out in 30 minutes with working glasses again ! Super friendly staff.< /Text><response>None</response>< rating>

<user_id>118103657684771016924<//user_id><review>Friendly staff! Called in as an emergency on Monday Presidents day holiday.  Had a great experience coming here. They took me in right away and took care of me. I had fallen asleep with my contacts on and thought I had lost one in my eye. After trying to remove a contact that was not , I irritated my eye. Doctor took care of me right away and was very clear and and I could tell he was passionate about his job. He checked to make sure I didn't scratch my retina by and gave me some tips on how to bring the swelling down. Thankfully my eye looked good aside from the swelling. Very thankful to the doctor and staff who took care of me. Hands down the best experience I've had in an optometrist. I will be switching to this office.<//review><Name>Ignacia Morales</Name><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1613537761324< /Time></record></dataset><record>

<text>I am always apprehensive going to a new doctor/facilty, with that said, all went very well.
This was my first visit with Dr Wang. From scheduling to meeting staff and Dr Wang, I can say all were very professional and organized.
Staff was helpful, nice & professional. Dr. Wang answered my questions and was very nice. Office was clean and adhered to COVID regulations. I believe I have found my Hi-Desert Optometrist.</text>< Pictures>

<review>I came here 12/2/20 and THIS PLACE IS GREAT! Especially Manny Gamez! He found frames for my sister so fast! She really liked them! He helped me find the perfect fit for the frames I liked. He was patient with us and he was kind and always gave us compliments about how the frames looked! Such very kind staff, the front desk was awesome as well! Everyone was so very kind. I definitely recommend coming here for your eye checks! 100%!!!!! Couldnt ask for a better place!<//review>< Name>

I have seen Anthony Wang for over ten years! I used to go to just anybody until I met him. He has always been caring, personal, and attentive to me and I'm sure his other patients. I would highly recommend him to anybody if they want a great optometrist doctor that cares about your vision.</text>

I’ve been coming for already a year and took my mom as well and we both recommend for anyone looking for a really good optometrist to come here!! They have lots of patience and most accurate information given!

I got to my appointment 20 min early and then they saw me nearly 25 min after.my appointment. Doctor was polite because he knew I wasn’t happy sitting there for 45 minutes.
Then it turns out they don’t carry contact lenses in my prescription. Which is dumb since every Optometrist I’ve met from a California to Virginia has that prescription. Now I have to drive back in three days to pick up my prescription.

Not happy.< /Review>

This is by far the BEST experience I’ve ever had with staff members in an establishment located in Victorville. Everybody has been so kind to me and always gives me the best they have to offer. As long as I live in the high desert this will always be my optometrist office of choice. Manny and Joccelyn, I give you guys each 5 stars on your customer service. Thank you so much for taking time with me and being so helpful and friendly.< /text>

I had a very bad experiece with this place.  The doctor seemed very good and caring. After the exam he showed me my vision now (blurry) and then with glasses (clear).  I had to go back twice and nothing has changed.  When I watch TV with the new glasses, and lift them up there is absolutely no difference!  I'm due for my yearly exam but I won't be going back to Advantage!!!</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I had a really bad experience at this place I do not recommend going to this place at all. First of all, they rush your appointments and second of all, the quality of the contact lens and glasses aren't very good they seem very cheaply made. You will not get your money's worth from this place. EDIT: In addition, the doctor never gives you ANY instructions on how to use contacts and what type of solution you should use. They just hand you the contacts and send you on your way. It seems like they don't care about their patients at all. Luckily, we were able to google how to use contacts and what type of solution we should use. I really don't recommend going to this optometrist at all.</text></record>

From making an appointment with the very nice & profesional receptionist Lesly to meeting with Dr.Wang Everything went smoothly ! I was able to get my glasses and contacts faster than I had ever previously at any other optometrist. Lesly was very kind and patient with me trying to accomadte my schedule. 10/10 would recommend to anyone! Great Staff ! Great Service ! You have made a lifetime customer !<//Review></record></dataset><record>

To the Receptionist I spoke with.. You are worthless. Let me say this to you. I called to reschedule yesterday because I have a bad headache and my blood pressure is high and agreed to be seen today at noon. Now I came 30mins before my appointment(thats how it should be because you guys will give me forms to fill out. So anyhow I only see this clinic once a year for eye checkup and issuance of new frame for my coverage every 2 years and you can not do all your job properly. To my disappointment I was scheduled for June 21st they said. I have 2 kids to prepare I ha ve work to call off just to have my eyes be checked. This lady did not do anything to control the damage nor calm my feelings down... Like they don't care. Dr Wang is the nicest doctor but he has poor choice on his staff. I did filed a grievance against all of your inconvenience you have caused me and the irresponsibility of all your acts today. You guys are worst. Ive been going to this clinic for 3 yrs now and I would not change my eye doctor I want to see all your failed and poker faces and I want you all see mine... No sorry at all? really? I hope you all guys meet the same person with that attitude that did this to me so you will know.. 👆🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️<//review>

< Review>
my first experience with Dr. Reed went like this:  My 7 year old son  felt forced and manipulated into a prescription   that he could not see at all. He was condisending, and did not check his work the way you expect a professional  too. I am highly dissapointed in this doctor.  my son left this place crying, and my wife did not like the way he spoke to my boy either so she left. the prescription  was  supposedly 3× worse than last year. impossible! my son is a sweetheart who wouldn't hurt a fly.  He is one of the best readers in his grade at his school and has amazing patience.  he's just a great child. my other two are your regular kind of kids. they play and get in trouble. what I'm saying is you DR. REED ruined the experience of my son's yearly eye exams because you have an attitude and think your right when your not.   I hope you never get a chance to work with children again.</Review>

They said one of my driver side control arm was possibly broken and needed to be replaced, Barry wanted to charge me $400. I look into videos and checked myself and their is nothing wrong with what they claimed. Neither side was broken
Barry is a scammer, do not trust him or his other employees.< /Text>

I had a fantastic experience today at Sears Auto Center in Clovis, CA this afternoon. The young man that helped me and discussed issues regarding my car was Ryan Lake. Super customer service and auto repair. Definitely hard to find these days and honesty regarding estimates, repairs, etc. I found Ryan to be quite meticulous in his questioning, and also multi-tasking with other customers coming in behind me. Such a calm and kind young man to everyone he spoke with and well mannered. I definitely recommend going here if you don't want to be taken to the cleaners. If you are an impatient person/customer, I would highly recommend making an appointment. I am grateful for my visit today and to Mr. Lake as well as the outstanding mechanic. Thanks again and look forward to my next oil-change.< /review>

I went in for an oil change but they held my car for 6 days because they broke parts. I had a  slow leak in my  oil pan that wasn't bothering me but they offered to fix it for $300. It's still leaking 6 months later. If you care about your time or money please avoid. Management told me to have a spare car for their shoty work.<//review>

Have not had any really good experiences here. I went in for a oil change and nothing happened for about 3 hours, even though I made an appointment. Once I told them to give me back my car the tech magically came back from his lunch and did my oil change.<//review>

Thanks Sears Auto Center, Clovis, for remaining open to the public.
I have used Sears Auto Centers for over 15 years.  This time was different, as an emergency arose when some heartless individual(s) went on a vandalism spree, slashing at 5 vehicle's tires in one night.  From the instant I spoke with RYAN LAKE at the Auto Center, the process of replacing my tires began to take a positive form.  Ryan was kind, understanding, let alone sympathetic, recognizing my distraught.  He worked diligently and thoroughly to assist in this financial situation.
It was necessary to meet him face-to-face to offer appreciation and many "thank you(s)" for his professionalism. This review is about Sears, the Auto Center Technicians, and Ryan.   Thank you, again.< /Text>

sears auto has the worst inexperienced workers ever.  They did not screw in my tire air tube and it left me stranded at a park.  All for tires flat.   Had to be towed home.  Leb swab said this was the simplest thing and most important process which they cannot understand why sear staff would forget to do since it was dangerous and could hurt kill me or someone.  Justin and crew excuse was oh ok bring it back.  Never.  Your team is lacking.  Bye bye ti your jobs which you cant do anyways.  You have been warned.  Justin and his crew are careless.</review>

My car got vandalized and I had to have all four tires replaced. I checked a few other places before coming here but I picked Sears because I was tired of looking at tires and they had what I needed in stock.

As far as service, they went above and beyond and made the whole ordeal a lot less stressful. Their staff is knowledgeable and efficient. They were the only ones to tell me that there was another manufacturer approved tire size for my car which made getting tires that day much easier. Their customer service is exceptional and I cannot recommend them enough.< /review>

Called in late afternoon to see if they could accommodate an oil change 2 hours prior to close, I was told they were backed up but could squeeze my car into their schedule. Arrived 1.5 hours prior to close, nevertheless my car service was completed in 45 minutes. They also had the best price I could find in the area for a full synthetic oil change.<//Text>

< Review>
I took my car here for years and loved the service. I'm not sure what happened to the service but the last time I went I was very unhappy. I had just had them put on new tires and check the brakes a couple weeks before but they said everything was fine. My brakes continued to make noise (but only going down hill or at high speeds) I needed my oil changed so I took it back for that and for them to take it out on the road so they could HEAR the noise instead of just looking at the BRAKE pads which they already told me LOOKED fine. At check in they tried to up sell me a coolent flush which I declined. When they called me for a update they said the car wasn't making any noises at all. After questioning if they actually drove it or just looked at it they said they drove it and it made no noise. (which is absolutely not true!) then said that my coolent was low and I needed a coolent flush. I asked why I would need a flush if it was just low and he couldn't explain just said it was what they recommended. So not only did they not drive it to hear the brakes they LIED about it and try to up sell the coolent flush again! NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!< /Review>

If anyone has had issues with batteries and warranty replacements you are not alone. They will wheel out their test station and either tell you your battery is fine, or to charge and retest. Don't waste your time with these guys. Even auto-zone can accurately and honestly test your battery. I took my battery under warranty there for two years, they told me it was fine, not until I demanded they stop using their current tester did they comply. Took them a day to test it. It was bad. Got my replacement battery just in time. Sad to say the replacement battery went out a year later. They are currently giving me the run around telling me to charge and retest when interstate and auto-zone, both got the same readings. They will not warranty the new battery, saying that the warranty is only on the original purchase. I wasted precious time believing their machine.<//text>

<Review>After reading some of the comments regarding this shop I was originally hesitant to come here. My experience couldnt have been better. Not only was my car finished faster than expected, Barry was one of the kindest and honest mechanics I have ever met!

I originally took my car to another shop and they told me that I had an alternator problem. I scheduled time to go into the Sears shop to have it fixed. Instead of just fixing the alternator and charging me $800, Barry helped diagnose the real and less expensive solution which cost me $135. In life you need honest doctors, dentists, and mechanics. I found some here!!! Barry and Mario were great!< /Review>< pics>

Had a great experience today at Sears Auto in Clovis, CA.  Yee, our mechanic, was terrific and very helpful explaining what was wrong with our car.  He took the time to show us instead of just telling us.  Mario and Jesse have always been so courteous and genuinely care about us and our repeat business.  They are friendly, kind, knowlegable, helpful, and great to deal with!  Thanks to all these men.<//review>

Miguel is mildly helpful. Non committal, struggles through the details. Takes an over abundance of time to complete simple tasks. The other old guy with the gut hanging over his belt... How is this man on payroll? Useless human being. When he gets a free moment away from customers rather than help his associate who is obviously struggling he walks off into the nearest corner like golem huddling over his phone or "precious" come here y'all if you like waiting 20 min to be acknowledged before anyone even offers to help... It's no wonder sears has become what it is today. Next stop... the Mervyn's train ---> Out of business. Lol go where you can get meaningful help and spend your dollars where they buy service.

Cant beat an honest review and this experience today was an honest waste of over 25 min of my life. I'll never be back and I USED to come to sears with my 5 vehicles. America's Tire --->   where service is prompt and meaningful.<//Review>

I started taking my car to Sears in 2010. They use to do such an amazing job. Over the years there service has deteriorated, and sadly I will no longer be a customer. I've had to take my car in for the same problem 3 times. Each time they assure me that they found the problem. The last time taking it in, I had to call to see the status of my car. I was on hold for over 5minutes, when someone finally picked up they still didn't know and had to place me on hold for another 5minutes. I've been in there once and watched while the phones rang and the employee stood there talking to another employee and refused to answer the phone. I'll be taking my business elsewhere.</Review>

Horrendously slow service.

I have been a long-time customer of Sears automotive in several states and have had excellent service before moving to Clovis.  It was because of this past positive experience that I continued to take my car to the Clovis Sears

I have dealt with this particular Sears several times in the past year, and each time the service is ridiculously slow.  Unfortunately there is no advantage to making an appointment as walk-ins are given equal priority and quoted similar wait times.  Clearly they know how to take an appointment, they just don't know how to honor the appointments.

A customer should never have to wait in line for over 30 minutes before being waited on.  And it should never take 2 hours to simply change oil.  Overall 2:30 is a horrendously unreasonable amount of time to get oil changed.

It is safe to say that I have given them the benefit of the doubt long enough and will be doing my business elsewhere from now on.</Text>

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!! After spending THOUSANDS of dollars on her vehicle over the years, I was just told by Barry that the 2 year warranty on the Alternator that we had purchased from Sears was not going to be honored because in their system, it didnt show that the alternator had been installed by them. They showed the purchase, along with the 2 Die Hard Gold batteries, they show the batteries being installed...just not the alternator. And then when I asked about them selling parts without installation, Barry told me that they MOST DEFINITELY DID NOT DO THAT!!!! So what gives...did they install my part (which they did), or did they sell it to me without installation??? Either way, I wasnt looking for anything other than to have my alternator replaced, and heck, I was even willing to change it out!!!! And as a GM of a MAJOR Auto Parts retailer myself, I am disgusted bu the way I was treated!!!!</Text>

Im having a BIG problem with the Sears Auto Center here in Clovis, CA.
I moved here from Boise. Idaho April 1, 2017 and before Idaho I lived in Phoenix, Arizona(husband in the United States Navy)
I bought an alternator for my 2005 F350 diesel truck from you guys almost 2 years ago and had you instal it. You guys installed the wrong one  the first time(an alt. For a dual alt. Set up which I do not have) and fried my batteries, FICM(Fuel Injection Control Module) and obviously the alternator. 1.5 years ago I brought the truck to your Boise, Idaho location when this happened(thats where the military moved us to). Boise location comped my batteries(since  I chose to pay for my FICM myself because I wanted an aftermarket one) and put the correct alternator in my truck. My alternator failed last week and stranded me with my 85 year old grandfather 300 miles from home. I called my local sears and the manager was a total jerk to me and would not honor the warranty even though he stated it was still valid. He stated he would not honor the warranty because the last sears didn't put notes in the account stating they installed it even though he has record of ALL of the purchases including that one. I called corporate and they assured me they would fight to get the alternator I had to buy so I could get home reimbursed and have the District Manager call me within 24-48 hours. This was 11/27. I've called 3 times now and been given the run around and still haven't been contacted my ANYONE. I have spent a lot of money with Sears over the years as my account will reflect and I would like to continue to do so however if this matter isn't resolved I will never step foot in Sears again.

< review>
after a new battery, 3 alternaters in 6 months the blame was put on a 84 year old woman who complained about having to keep replacing  defective parts supplied by sears. The absolute worst part was the Service manager Barry was rude and and made negative comments about this senior citizen in front of other customers. I now understand why sears is on their way out. DON'T SHOP AT SEAR AUTO !!!!!</review>

<user>106925757127242271767< /user><Text>The food is very Hardy perfect for someone who works hard and can afford the extra calories. The papusas are very flavorful and hit the spot. I've been out in this area fixing a roof and after 10 hours of back breaking labor nothing satisfies my belly like a proper Salvadorian meal prepared by good people with a passion to share their beautiful culture.

Depending on what you order the food can be carbohydrate heavy but isnt greasy or flavorless -- very fresh.

The food was warm when I picked it up, the staff all had masks, and the restaurant itself was clean.</Text>< Date>

Almost always mess up my order. But when they give me what i ask for, it's pretty good food. The young lady at the counter is very snooty. I doubt i'll go there again.< /Review>

*Pupusas were SOO good 👍
*Curtido was not that fresh but still edible.
*Salsa for the pupusas was very watered down. It was just okay.
*Platanos Fritos with beans n cream were really really GOOD!!!

Can't speak for the rest of the food or staff, etc. as it was a third party delivery. Will try this restaurant again.</text>

Simply put. The PAPUSAS Are one of the best in town. I always order the yuca Frita con Chicharrón, which is always A+. Another thing that makes this place so super amazing is their pickled cabbage. Every time I order I need extra bags of pickled cabbage. It's good on everything it's perfectly seasoned, and perfectly pickled. I love this Salvadoran place. It's simply amazing.
I've had a few of their breakfast place also with your nice and hearty. It's good for breakfast lunch or dinner. And perfect for the college kids that go to Contra Costa College<//Text>

Food was the perfect level of salty. It's like they read my mind and knew exactly how much salt I needed, both taste wise and physically. Check it; that deep fried plantain! So good. I usually don't like plantains but loved this one. Honestly the food couldn't have better, all the staff seems super friendly and the wait for the food isn't as long as other places. It's not that costly and feels right at home if you have Salvadoran roots.< /Text>

<review>After I placed my order, they told me total, then when I asked to confirm it, gave me other total, when I went to pick it up, charged me other amount. My order wasn’t complete, and after I called they, they didn’t apologize for the inconvenient. I do not think I would be back to that restaurant. Bad service!</review>< pics>

<Review>If you dont mind poor customer service and ok food this is the place for you. Come here hoping to get 1 particular waiter that knows proper customer service but shes never there when we go. Food is ok not bad but not amazing neither way better that other places around the area tho. Took my own cup of coffee and the waiter rolled her eyes and brought  me a toy cup like if their coffee was good. Food was served and never saw the waiter again we had to ask the register guy for napkins and more coffe and more curtido... we were practically our own waiters.<//Review><Response>None</Response>< name>

What I suggest is that they have a hostess for busy days because they look disorganized with that.  On this visit my fiance asked for one pupusa to accompany his main plate. The waitress said you can only order two  and I told her that we always order one along with the main dish, she repeated you can only order two, we ordered them, but they can have better service without their rules that commit you to ask for something you don't want.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>The building is nice and clean all the time. The food is nice but some of the things can be pretty be pretty overpriced like some of the breakfast items. I remember seeing a plate with a BIT of refried beans, a BIT of rice, like 2 small fried eggs, 4 pieces of fried plaintains for about $17 which is insane.<//Review>< pictures>

Wow
Great food. Great service. Great fun. Tunes were on point and a man yelled along to the song.
Food was the perfect level of salty. It's like they read my mind and knew exactly how much salt I needed, both taste wise and physically.
Check it; that deep fried plantain! So good. I usually don't like plantains but loved this one<//Review>

Salvadorean Restaurant, has great dishes. There pupusas are good, they aren't grease, the taste is great. Their steak and shrimp dish is very good. The employees are nice. Place gets packed on the weekends.</Text>

Terrible place!! This place rips you off every chance they get. They add a few dollars here and there and even add the tip without telling you. If you don't notice you will be overcharged or may tip twice. They've overcharged me every visit. After a long absence, I go back in hopes it's changed and it's even worse. No more visits from me.. The guy behind the counter is a shark, rude and has no concept of customer service. He is snarky and sarcastic and blames you if they get the order wrong. The food is mediocre and not worth what they charge. Save your money and go get great pupusas, good food with good customer service across the street. Minus 1 star!!! Terrible, terrible.< /review>

Food  is ok but customer service is the worse. A little pricy for that type of customer service in my opinion. Waited for food about 45 min and one of my kids has to wait longer, when I asked for my son’s food the waitress said it would take another 5-10 min more so how can you start eating when one of your children has to wait that long?? First and last time there.<//text>

Haven't been here in a while and this place seems like it's going down, the waitresses are gossiping talking about massages with happy ending with a man colleague... Like no one cares to hear this while we are waiting for our food to eat so unprofessional , they talk to much and stand around while tables sit with out being cleaned. I waited for my food legit 45 minutes when there was only 3 other tables . After that they didn't even bother to check back up to see if everything was ok.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Love this place! I've gone for lunch and for dinner. There is a selection of Salvadoran, Mexican and other regional latin fare. My go to is the fried plantain with beans and sour cream and 2 papusas. Delicious and economical too. Family friendly, but gotta say the kids options are not exactly health conscious, but who doesn't like a deep fried treat time to time ? :)< /review><Gmap_id>0x808577c32eceecb9:0x706ab0c5a84b0434</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

The food is good but the service is somewhat poor here. Takes a while for simple dishes to be served and if you dont speak Spanish it's pretty difficult to get your order in with the language barrier.<//text>

If you are getting the food to go you should call and place your order before picking it up.
Clean family friendly establishment. Very good prices. I will be there soon to eat again.< /text>

Honestly the food couldn't have better, all the staff seems super friendly and the wait for the food isn't as long as other places. It's not that costly and feels right at home if you have Salvadoran roots.<//Text>

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR APPETITE HERE! You have been warned. The server, seems to have lack of basic customer service or common sense for that matter. Just because you walk back behind the counter doesn’t mean we can’t hear you gossiping from the farthest table in your lobby. And the food is so bland. Not at all worth the wait or the price. You are better off across the street at the real authentic Salvadorian restaurant or even the nearest pizza just a few doors down. Esta comida no sirve para nada y el servicio peor!!!<//review>

< review>
Im so disappointed in them i went tonight to buy pupusas and my son almost chocked on a piece of plastic and then i was chewing on mine and got another plastic as well. This is ridiculous how do u not check your food while prepping and could you imagine if my son and i would have choked.. i called them immediately and all the guy could say i dont know how that happend and making me feel like i made it up! Excuse me your lucky i was nice enough to call and inform you verses me call FOOD Administration on your place.. after my full on discussion he could only say well if you want come back and we will exchange them. Instead of giving a sincere apology and offering to refund. Honestly i will never go back. Thanks but no thank you!!!<//review>

Horrible  food! I got camarones rancheros and there was only like 6 shrimp and the rest was lots and lots of onion mix with jalapeños and bell peppers,  the beans were nasty , they tasted old and the rice was hard it looked like it was mixed with old rice , I will not go back ! NASTY</Text>

Used to come here every week, but stopped coming because the service went down. Tried it again today and the waitress was very unattentive. Got something in my food and they replaced the item and left everything else in the same plate, and was still charged for it. Asked for coffee refill, as well as the check. Coffee took forever to arrive, and the check never did. Had to go to the front desk. No smiles, no thank you. Service is terrible!</Text>

<review>I used to love these place 😍 but not anymore 😭 .....They over charged me twice on two different days . I called them and they said they can't do anything about it because it was not on a different shift . Also they let people go into the restaurant asking for money and is very uncomfortable.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Park my van in the parking lot when I came out from eating my car was hit parking there too small then they said the cameras weren't working that means you can break the windows from the car in the parking lot and Rob everything in the cars and there is no cameras recording bummer<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Each time they give a terrible service and they have even charged me for what I have not eaten and without giving a receipt for what I consumed, the people who attend have been arrogant many times, I think that one is going to pay for what one is going to eat, not that give it away. There is a young lady who attends in the morning and she is very charismatic and kind, she gives her best effort. But those in the afternoon leave much to be desired.

(Original)
Cada vez dan un servicio pésimo y hasta me han cobrado lo que no me he comido y sin dar recibo de lo que consumí, las personas que atienden han sido muchas veces arrogantes, creo que uno va a pagar lo que se va a comer no que le regalen. Hay una señorita que atiende en la mañana y es muy carismatica y amable, da su mejor esfuerzo. Pero las de la tarde dejan mucho que desear.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I'm not sorry for the service, what do you have there, I was there on Sunday, they just left me standing as a post waiting while the maids speak and speak better, I went to another restaurant, hopefully and in the future they will have better staff.

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is excellent but the attention is very bad in many things I like to go but sometimes you forget to make an order that we ask, do not carry everything that the saucer says it takes when Servin one has to be asking what he needs the hot drinks are not very hot, but the only thing that the food is good but the attention is very bad.

(Original)
La comida está excelente pero la atención es muy mala en muchas cosas me gusta ir pero unos veces se le olvida hacer una orden que pedimos, no llevan todo lo que el platillo dice que lleva cuando lo Servin uno les tiene que estar pidiendo lo que necesita las bebidas calientes no están muy calientes, pero lo único que la comida está bueno pero la atención es muy mala.</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) The food is tasty, but the service for you to attend this bad, the waitresses talking, and customers waiting to be served wait 30 minutes just to take the menu, you see that they are not grabbing anything but they will not serve you, Last time I have this place.

(Translated by Google) Good food but very bad service, whenever we have gone with my family to past something negative, to mention a few things, once they threw the paper that avia wrote the sheet, and after an hour I asked for the order They gave an account, and again they took the food and they did not take them fork or knife or napkins, again we asked them to take two more coffee and they did not take them, that's just to mention a few things, finally come to the conclusion of not returning to this place.

(Original)
Buena comida pero muy mal servicio, siempre que emos ido con mi familia a pasado algo negativo, por mencionar algunas cosas, una vez tiraron a la vasura el papel que avia escribido la mecera, y asta después de una hora que pregunte por la orden se dieron cuenta, y otra vez los llevaron la comida y no los llevaron tenedor ni cuchillo ni cervilletas, otra vez les pedimos a dos meceras que los llevaran más cafe y no los llevaron, eso nomas por mencionar algunas cosas, al fin llegue a la conclusión de no regresar a este lugar.<//Review>

<Date>1535335944013<//Date><rate>2<//rate><review>(Translated by Google) Pupusas are useless, of so many restaurants that I have visited in all the years that I have lived in this country what are many, these are the worst pupusas I have ever eaten, to start the pupusas are not acidic 2nd. The pork rind had no flavor, the filling of the SALVADORAN PUPUSAS IS SPECIFIC, it is not only the ground pork, I feel very bad, 👎 the food has no flavor 😔

(Original)
Las pupusas no sirven para nada, de tantos restaurants que he visitado en todos los años que he vivido en este país qué son muchos ,estás son las peores pupusas que he comido , para empezar las pupusas no son ácidas 2do.  El chicharrón no tenia ningún sabor, el relleno de las PUPUSAS SALVADOREÑAS ES ESPECIL, no es solamente el puerco molido lo siento muy malas, 👎 la comida no tiene sabor 😔<//review>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><Text>(Translated by Google) It was one of my favorite places, until this past weekend, I had my bad experience with an arrogant and foolish waitress, I do not know if she owns the restaurant or if she is too pedantic, they should train their employees well because if they do not like it That job they look for one that suits them, since the food is not served free of charge.

(Original)
Era uno de mis lugares favoritos, hasta este pasado fin de semana, tuve mi mala experiencia con una mesera prepotente y necia no se si es dueña del restaurante o que pero es demasiado pedante deberian de capacitar bien a sus empleadas ya que si no les gusta ese trabajo que busquen uno que se les acomode, ya que la comida no la sirven de a gratis.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, I do not return to This Place, wait 20 minutes and no napkins were brought to the table, in that time 4 people (men) came to the table next to me and immediately they put napkins, tanned and drinks .. And when I asked for utensils they told me they weren't dry. So after the wait and attitude of the employees I decided to leave the Place and not return ...

Pesimo servicio, no regreso a Este Lugar, espere 20 minutos y ni servilletas trajeron a la mesa, en ese tiempo llegaron 4 personas (hombres)a la mesa de a lado y enseguida les pusieron servilletas, curtitido y bevidas..

<Review>(Translated by Google) They use the milk from the coffee again to give it to the customers, it came dirty and when I asked for another look they did not fill it, they just grabbed one that they had collected from the counter and since there were not many people I knew it was from the other table because the frets when they gave me that milk and that one had sauce and I told him and they didn't listen to me anymore. The tanning of the pupusas was dry for me. I had several days left and I asked for a fresher one. They wanted to charge me. they did and it was still heard outside .. the worst service I could have and I still was not leaving when I hear that they start to say that the table is stingy that they did not leave a tip .. how can I leave if I still do not leave

(Original)
La leche del café la vuelven a utilizar para dársela a los clientes, venía sucia y cuando pedi otra mire que no la llenaron sólo agarraron una que habían recogido del mostrador y como no había mucha gente sabía que era de la otra mesa porque ahí seguían los trastes cuando me dieron esa leche y esa tenía salsa y le dije y ya no me hacían caso. El curtido de las pupusas me tocó seco ya tenía varios días echo y pedi otro más fresco me lo quisieron cobrar, el cajero es muy grosero al pedirle las cosas, una mesera alta flaca se la paso diciendo groserías dentro de la cocina por cada pedido que le hacían y todavía se escuchaba afuera.. el peor servicio que pude tener y todavía no me iba cuando escucho que empiezan a decir que tacaña la mesa que no dejó propina.. como voy a dejar si aún no me voy</Review>< GmapID>

It is that note that lately there is too much demand for pupusas and sometimes there are orders of up to 100 or more and it costs to get the smallest orders in between because we have already given a time or the client sets the time for when he wants them !!! I'm really sorry if you had to wait a long time !!! 🙏🙏\n\n(Original)\nGracias por darnos tu opinión!!!

(Translated by Google) Friendly waitress, wanting to do a good service, more inexperienced, the waiting time is approximately 45 minutes ... the Salvadoran soup well what the flavor should be ... the shrimp and the crab legs leave them at the end and they had a rotten taste ... anyway just good small portion ... omelets made by hand the best .... place has a lot of potential more it lacks too much ... relatively exaggerated price for food ..

This April 6 there were some beautiful roses in honor of Francis, it's her birthday. She's such a nice girl who gives a special toke to the restaurant.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Woww I was surprised at the bad service they have in this place with the lack of experience of the waitresses or those who carry the food if they can be called so they have no order or experience in how to serve the clients I had to wait 30 mnts . To hear my Order and one hour to be waiting for an atol.
Recommendation!!! ORDER THE MEAL BY TELEPHONE ONE HOUR BEFORE AND ORDER THE TABLE IN TIME

(Original)
Woww me quede sorprendida del mal servicio que tienen en este lugar con la poca falta de experiencia de las meseras o las que llevan la comida si asi se les puede llamar no tienen Orden ni experiencia en como atender a los clientes yo tuve que esperar 30 mnts. Para que me escucharan mi Orden y una hora para estar esperando un atol.
Recomendacion!!! PEDIR LA COMIDA POR TELEFONO UNA HORA ANTES Y PEDIR LA MESA A TIEMPO< /Review>< Rate>
