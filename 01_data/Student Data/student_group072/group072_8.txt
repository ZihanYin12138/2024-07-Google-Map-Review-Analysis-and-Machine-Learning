<Review>These guys are amazing, brought my note 9 to unlock and jp and co did a great job. Now I can use my phone international as well. The customer service is amazing as well especially jp who is so down to earth and excellent tech. I saw him help old gentleman with such elegance and patience where most of us would lose it. I am not tech savvy but to deal with multiple non tech savvy individuals needs a good heart and patience and jp does that I will always recommend these guy's.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>These guys are a pro & quick.
I had 2 iPhones & a MacBook which was  repaired in half the cost originally quoted to me by Apple service center +waiting..
best part the guy JP saved all the data which was very important & main concern ..
Hands on would recommend them to my friends and anyone who is fed up off long wait & Stereo typical answers.
Thank you LA iPhone repair👍!!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO46VLaVDlDkTet_vt5mYhBS4WzFxVr5lj-qxX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2b9694c145815:0x6cab5a1a293f3dda< /Gmap_id><Review>I first went there to sell my old iPhone 8. The owner (JP) inspected the phone and said "this phone is in mint condition. I might have a buyer for it." He made some calls and found me a buyer within minutes. And the phone was sold! At a much higher price than what Apple was offering me for trading it in. What more?! JP didn't charge me a penny (as his commission) for the transaction. And just said "it was done in goodwill". I have stuck to this place for all my cell phone (all electronics in general) related stuff ever since. Highly recommended!< /Review>< Rating>

I had to get my iPhone 11 battery replace. I contacted this store on goggle and they said that they have apple battery’s. They put in a battery and I got battery error message. I have called them and they were no help. They were so rude and disrespectful. They will say that they have apple parts but they don’t. I wish I never went here. I asked them for a refund and they fully ignored that. This place is fake. I will never go back to this place ever<//text>

I came here with a cracked screen on my Iphone and they were able to replace it quickly and easily and my phone was good as new once again with a high quality screen. So much so, I was able to trade in that phone with the replaced screen and get the full trade-in value. They were professional, easy to talk to and very helpful. Highly recommended!</text>

<text>Jp was excellent in taking care of my phones😉. I brought in couple phone iPhone XR for unlock and screen repair and LG phone for unlock, everything was taken care of immediately and I got exactly what I wanted in no time and with a very reasonable price I thought I was stuck with phones I wouldn’t be able to use but Jp and co did their magic and I am a happy man. I will always recommend this place to anyone. Five stars all the way…<//text>< Pictures>

I brought my old samsung s10+ to this store to be unlocked. At the moment I can't afford to buy a new phone with my carrier thats why I needed it to be unlocked.  They did a great job, my phone its back to life and I saved money. Thank you do much. I recommend you to bring ur phone for any kind of issue you may have.< /Review>

<Text>I shopped around to get my iphone x screen fixed and this was by far the best place. I walked in and felt very comfortable. The people there are very knowledgeable. They fixed my screen and took get care of me. The price was excellent and the quality of the product even better. Other places were charging more for less of a product. Will definitely be coming back for any future repairs. Thanks again. Shout out to J.P. keep up the good work.< /Text><Date>1600828122764< /Date>< Rating>

He was ready and available and offered a more than fair price. 15 minutes he was working on it and it was fixed in 20 minutes! I had been dealing with a faulty phone for 9 months and it was instantly fixed, and is working like new. And the cosmetic look of it is beautiful. Looks like it’s fresh off the shelves!

I called many places to get my XS screen replaced and this place had the best deal and was affordable. Not only they were open while the covid-19 is happening, they were able to fix my phone in short period of time. If I were to take my iPhone to the Apple store, I would have been charged a lot but thanks to them. Thanks to JP for the best customer service. Definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks guys.<//text>

<text>Jp is the best!! I’ve broken my phone too many times to admit and his customer service is unparalleled. I tell all my friends about his store. It’s always clean, he’s always super friendly and I get the best prices ever. So professional and yet because I’ve been back so many times, by now he feels like a friend.

< review>
It was worth a broken iPhone X to discover JP and his store. From the first call, which he took right away, to the last passing of currency, my experience was everything I needed it to be and more. JP knew exactly what he was doing, and not only fixed my immediate problem, he solved another problem I’d been having with my iPhone X that has been plaguing me for months and months.. First he put on a new screen, and then fixed a volume problem that another iPhone technician from a different company had caused and never owned up to. And, the price was as reasonable as it could possibly be. It is always a drag to break your phone, but in this case, the silver lining was meeting JP and knowing now where I can always take my cell phone. Wishing you the same!</review>

<review>My iPhone didn’t improve( I guess it got a little bit worst), after he serviced my iPhone. Also, the front camera lens is not clear, somehow he has not clean the front lens after he was servicing my phone. The person working there was not accurate about the time he needed for fixing my iPhone (On the phone he said 20 minutes is the time I needed, however when I was at store he said it will take about an hour). Moreover, he did not have the part I needed for my phone. He was not wearing his mask all the time when I was at store.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b9694c145815:0x6cab5a1a293f3dda< /gmap_id></record>

I’ve called everywhere in LA and everyone said it’ll take 3 days just to replace my iPhone 10 battery(expanding battery). I lost lots of business yesterday 08-15-20. I went back to thei guy who told me to comeback at 10am as he will have my new battery to install. I came back no battery yet had to wait till 2 or 3pm. I started calling around again and the 3rd phone repair I called is this specific phone repair who happens to be an awesome one. Thank you so much Javed for installing a new battery & gave me new screen protector. I love this place & I will recommend to anyone I know to take their broken or malfunction device here. This place save my day.🥰🥰 I’m forever thankful.
I forgot to say that installation was cheaper than any other place in LA. It cost me $76 including tax. Othe place want $99 plus installation fee & tax -$150 + installation fee tax.< /text>

We went to another place first and it was going to take 2 hours. My son said let’s go to this place on LaCienega the guy is great and fast. So we went and he wasn’t kidding. The place had other customers but JP, the head guy, did both our phones in 30 minutes!! And he was also fixing other people’s phones fast too. He was like a magician, like David Blane or David Copperfield he was so fast. Plus, a super nice, hard-working guy. Don’t waste your time with the other place ... run , don’t walk ... RUN to see JP, he’s the real deal if your phone is busted. And he has the best prices in town. 10 stars not 5 stars but 10.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>This is my second time coming to this place and I can’t be happier enough. This time I brought in My iPhone XR the screen was very badly broken and I thought I had lost my phone bec I thought it was totaled . But sunny took care of it in within 20 mins and my phone is like brand new. You know the place is a good place is when someone goes above and beyond to rescue you since everything I do depends on the my phone. Also I thought the price would be super high but it turned out to be half of it, what more can I ask for and what more can anyone ask for. This is best place in town save me money and save my business money. This place should be 5 stars ⭐️ for now and forever.<//text>< pictures>

I thought initially the younger guy gave me a nice service about two weeks ago when I needed to replace my screen. He suggested to get a new battery as well, now my ph is having issues! Came back to see if he could help but all I got was  a smart mouth. I got so frustrated because I didn’t come in to blame him but now with his aggression I believe it’s a defensive reaction to guilt. My ph is older and I'm open to fixing it or getting a new one but since i didn’t trust getting a used one from him... ( no guarantees) he was aggressive and forceful. I will not trust them/him! You lost a customer. Next time  just suggest or recommend but to you being right was more important than being a good business man. Smh...<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

They were honest and directed me to Apple since the cost to fix my phone was going to be high enough to not be worth it. I had no idea and was willing to pay. Sure enough, for only $30 more Apple was able to give me a new phone. Greatly appreciate the honesty from Los Angeles iPhone Repair & Unlock Center. Thank you!!<//Text>

I was not sure 🤔before bec when first got my iPhone fixed at another location the screen quality was not good, so I was a lil skeptical but to my suprise I am was pleasantly happy bec jp and team gave me great service, best quality screen for a reasonable price. I spent a fortune on my first repair at the other place and this place charges way lower than that and with even better premium quality. I will always recommend them to anyone in my opinion they are best iPhone repair place in town, I saw customers come to them from Long Beach n San Pedro also there some Aracadia. It’s unbelievable...5 star 🌟 to these guys. Thank you 🙏🏽</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Very poor experience. Brought phone in for screen repair, promised next day fix.
Called next day and received terrible customer service. Phone was not ready, told to come back the next day.
Came back next day, phone was not repaired. Technician returned the phone, the screen had been replaced but now the charging port is non functional. Screen did not fit the phone body.
I would give a zero if I could but to be fair the technician did return the $100 deposit he demanded in advance.
Phone now must be replaced.</Text>

Fast, friendly and professional.. The best service ever! I visited this shop on Sat at 4 pm today, and it took only 10 mins for him to repair my iPhone 6 screen (including the protection glass). Oh yea, and he also gave me & attached a protection glass for free! This place is definitely a 4 star and strongly recommend to everyone.<//review>

< review>
My charging port had the tip of the charging tip stuck in the port then I came to this repair store. At first a man told me it's 39.99 dollars to fix it. But after they fixed, another man came out and say it will cost me 60 dollars. AND he continued asking me to fix my iPhone x screen. even if I told him I don't want to fix that. Finally they force me to give them 5 star review or they won't let me go. I was so angry that I never met such badass repair place in US! I really doubt why this place can get all the 5 star review! You cannot do this to two women from another country! I have our own right to write my own thought! Don't call me or text me or I will report you! Unscrupulous merchants！ Shame on you!< /review>

<review>Jay did an awesome job fixing my phone which the Apple store told me was unrepeatable. They suggested going to a data recovery shop that quoted me 1.5k! Jay ran a few tests free of charge and determined it actually only needed a new battery which cost me around $30. Lesson learned, don't give up on your phone until speaking with an honest company like these guys.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Worst place ever will not be returning back again went in to fix my iPhone screen , keep in mind everything worked inside the phone once I got my phone back the camera wasn’t working at all .i went back and jp told me it was my phone like if I didn’t know how I took my phone in . She wanted to charge me $40 each to fix front and back so $80 to have my camera back . Never coming back again , don’t ever come here .< /text>

< Review>
Came into the store on a Thursday afternoon with my Iphone 7 Plus screen looking like a spider web. I was helped upon walking in, and the staff was both helpful and knowledgeable. J.P. (the technician who worked on my phone) got to work immediately and came through very quickly with just the results I wanted. Considering the process took less than thirty minutes and I hadn't brought anything to keep me entertained, I felt like I was in and out in a flash.

This is an honest store with hardworking, good people doing right by the customer. Would definitely recommend/go back again.< /Review>

Obsoluley happy and satisfied with my visit here. Very nice guys. JP was able to unlock a phone I had that had been sitting in my drawer for almost a year because I was unable to use it. I almost gave up on it and almost threw it away! JP told me he could unlock it. So happy! It’s like I have a brand new phone! He fixed the broken screen and gave me a privacy protector too!  Love it!<//review>

<Text>Great service, phone screen fixed fast and done well! I would have given it a 5 stars but I had to find street parking and there was a lot of traffic at 4:30!! I would return for other services, if I need them! Great location for convenience, it is  off La Cienega and Cashio, if you are near Mid Wilshire and the Fairfax area!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>In all my years of life I have never been given such amazing service.  The staff and anyone involved in this establishment is top class A plus and honors all the around from me.

I had a virtually unfixable broken phone and it was one hour before I had a crucial law school exam at UCLA.

These guys saved my life and for almost NOT a cent compared anyone else in LA.

If you a single issue with a cell phone or need good deal on any issue come here or you in my pup in are insane!

They are amazing I would never go anywhere else not even if I had to wait a week vs go to this store.

The BEST!

I had a great experience...i had given up on my phone to ever getting repaired but sunny took care of it incredibly...and saved me a lot of money. I had been to many places but they couldn't repair my phone which was note 5 but this place took care of it precisely. I would highly recommend this place no matter what...very affordably for genuinely reasonable price and they make u feel at home. I am here always...if i ever I need to.< /text>

Fast, very inexpensive and they were straightforward about what my options were. In and out within 2 hours for a non typical repair (a drop had caused a dent in the casing, but no damage to the screen on my iPhone6) I totally appreciate when a business is willing to tell me what my options are even if it means I might not get service there.</text>

<review>If you’re looking for a great place to have your phone serviced, look no further. Ask for Sunny, no BS, quick, extremely affordable compared to competitors. Took less than and hour for an iPhone 8 Plus screen repair. If I am ever in the unfortunate situation of having to do this again( I’ll be going back. Thank you Sunny!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Right as I was getting out of car, I dropped my iPhone; my screen was broken. Luckily I was able to go to this repair shop before work. To my fortune, Sunny, the repair genius, was so helpful. He was able to repair my phone in about 20 minutes. He gave me a great deal, wayyy cheaper then the Apple Store. My phone works perfectly now and I don't have to walk around with a broken screen.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1501212585644, 'text': 'Thank you so much.

I was visiting in Los Angeles and had broke my phone so I looked around many places to get a quote, this is probably the best place I found with very good pricing and super good quality. My iPhone is back to working as new. Customer service is just beyond I can explain.
Thank you guys so much. Highly recommended if you looking for iPhone repair in Los Angeles.< /Review>

Was in a total bad situation. My phone was dead, Apple Store was not answering their phones, and other places didn’t have the part I needed. I stopped by on a whim when I saw their sign and couldn’t have been more pleased with the professionalism and service. So much cheaper and more convenient.  Support small business. These guys are great. JP could not have been more helpful or friendly.</Review>

< Review>
I was visiting in Los Angeles and had broke my phone so I looked around many places to get a quote, this is probably the best place I found with very good pricing and super good quality. My iPhone is back to working as new. Customer service is just beyond I can explain.
Thank you guys so much. Highly recommended if you looking for iPhone repair in Los Angeles.<//Review>

Their quote was better than just about any of the other places I called up... Very responsive too.  When I got to their shop, it was in and out, so the promptness was very appreciated.  My iphone 6s got busted on the screen, and the mic jack wasn't working, but Sonny helped out and was very courteous.  It was like new.< /text>

<review>Sonny was very friendly over the phone! I asked him for a quote on my damaged iPad screen. it was the most affordable price I found and the nearest location to my house. when I arrived, he greeted me at he door and walked me through the process of my repair. it took him less than 3 hrs to finish! He also gave me an awesome deal on a screen protection glass to prevent further damage.

Thank you Sonny!

<Review>This is by far the best iphone repair center in los angeles, i went there couple of times and also recomended to my family and frnds as well. All my family members and friends are happy with their service. JP is the guy who fix all your problems within minutes. They also sell phones for good prices and do the unlocking for cheaper prices.<//Review>< username>

I've had horrible luck with my iPhone and have paid ridiculous prices to get my screen fixed multiple times. Thankfully, this place had a screen for a reasonable price and fixed mine in a jiffy! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs screens or other phone parts/protectors!< /Review>

I have the utmost respect for Dr. King and what he offers. I was a person who was extremely frustrated because I did not have any significant diseases and was eating healthy and regularly exercising but still could not lose weight. Something was definetly wrong. Clearly it was the cleansing of the digestive system that got my body on track. I have lost 14 pounds and two sizes. I am 63 years old and am close to my pre pregnancy weight of 33 years ago. That is my goal. It is amazing what Dr. King's patients accomplish. People with far greater problems than I had have magnificent sucess. My sucess is magnificent too. I wasn't able to figure it out without Dr. King.</text>

< Review>
The Review Concierge business model is timely and effective--and it works! We have been paying tremendous attention to our online reviews for years, even being very proactive by asking our most happy patients to review us online and even providing them with a direct on-line link.  However, you just can't help the fact that one unhappy patient is more vocal than 100 happy patients. Unhappy patients will go to the far ends of the earth to disparage your practice, while the happiest get on with their lives and tend to provide no useful feedback.  The folks at Review Concierge understand these relationships and understand how to manage them to your benefit. This is especially helpful when review sights such as "Yelp" would must rather use negative information (they PREFER negative reviews). But as a business owner (and physician) we only want the positive reviews to reach the top.  This is where Review Concierge can help. They know how to fix these problems, but more importantly, they are experts in developing new 5-star reviews so that we don't have to worry about the bad ones!  If your are a doctor's office or doctor, then take the plunge. The cost is minimal for the protection of your business that it provides.  Make it work for you!< /Review>

Empathiq has been great to work with, and their software is very helpful. As long as we do our part, the software really helps us enhance and improve our online reviews and reputation. And they are always there to provide support when needed.<//review>

You will not find a better company when it comes to online presence management.  Healthcare specifically is a massive vertical that MUST keep an eye on their reputation.  The ease of use of the system, the knowledge of the staff, and effort put forth from everyone in the company is truly commendable.  I would recommend Empathiq to any provider or medical group who is up with the times, and understands the importance of having an attractive online presence.  Imagine how much having a fantastic online presence will affect your patient acquisition!<//Text>

This service is like having a private IT professional helping you, the busy physician, manage all aspects of online reviews. This is an essential aspect of today's medical practice. I would characterize Empathiq's work as committed, with attention to detail and immediate follow up. I recommend them without reservation.

Addendum 8-17-16: they continue to maintain superb service.<//text>

Review Concierge has helped put my mind at ease knowing there is a conscientious, responsive, and highly effective service that can address the concerns surrounding libelous and personal internet attacks. They instill a sense of trust, empathy, and have demonstrated the highest ethical conduct. I would recommend them to any professional looking for a high quality service that can help you with reputation management; truly a class A business.</review>

I manage the marketing and online reputation for a large, 4-location/30 doctor clinic. I have worked with EMPATHIQ for the last year and I am pleased with their services. They serve as an extension of my one-man marketing team and I consider them crucial in the new frontier of digital reputation management. When you finally come to the realization the internet can be a large and scary place for your business, let EMPATHIQ ease your worries and take care of you.

Special shout out to Justin Hawkes for all the help. Turns out I have been under-utilizing the resources and Justin, free of charge, spent an hour+ with me showing me all the wonderful new things EMPATHIQ can do. One of the more pleasant conversations I have had with a vendor in a LONG time. Someone get this guy a raise!< /Review>

<text>A most excellent service!! They not only notify you when new reviews are posted at a multiple number of websites, but they also assist in the removal of unfair reviews. I particularly like their providing excellent patient reviews, taken from multiple online ratings sites, for your website, particularly the ones that Yelp filters out. In that way visitors to your website are able to see all of those suppressed 5 Star Yelp reviews!

Finally, I love the way in which my patients are able to visit their website, post a review, and then have it sent to the appropriate ratings website where it is needed most to enhance my overall review score.

All of this for a very reasonable monthly rate that can be canceled at any time! Definitely a 5 Star Service!!< /text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1404493966258, 'text': 'Thank you, Dr. Sanders!

<review>Dr. Stacia Smith, Orthopedic Surgeon in both  Anacortes and Mt. Vernon,WA.  performed a  total knee replacement AND a hip replacement  for me.,  In my opinion she is the "Rock Star" of knee and hip  replacements, I have recovered very  well, from both surgeries, and I can do things pain free that I had not been able to do for 10 years.  I highly recommend this very competent  surgeon, not only is she a rock star surgeon, she is a very nice, compassionate  person, and you as her patient,  know that she truly cares about you as a person!   FIVE STARS for Dr. Stacia Smith of Skagit Northwest Orthopedics<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1443738773783, 'text': "What an awesome review you wrote for your doctor!

I consider my eye care my greatest heath concern. I suffered from glaucoma since 2002.  Dr. Vijay K. Battu has cared for my eyes since 2002.  He provides excellent care and is always on top of my condition and treatment.  I always get full attention and I never feel rushed.  Appointment wait time is always reasonable.

His office is immaculate, pleasant and his staff is attentive and helpful.<//Review>

<text>As an employee of EMPATHIQ, I'd have to say it is one of the greatest places I've ever worked. EMPATHIQ's number one priority is the quality of the product and how it helps customers. EMPATHIQ's prices are very competitive, usually costing 1/2 of what most competitors charge. The salesman are honest, customer service reps are kind and responsive, and best of all, the product works.

I'd recommend EMAPTHIQ to anyone.< /text>< Pictures>

The largest store and inventory of all the NorCal Golf Marts.  Dedicated computer bays for Honma, Callaway and Taylormade.  Several other open computer bays.  Repair shop, putting green, shoes, clothing and barrels of used clubs are worth a visit.  Any time that I'm in that area I'll stop by.</review>

Great inventory, but the customer service is really missing the mark.
If you know what you want and don't care if you get the cold shoulder then this is the place for you!<//Review>

<Name>Coach Peter</Name><Resp>None</Resp><Review>Winner. Staff is cool, fairly attentive. Very nice selection of new and  used equipment. One big bennie is their 90 day return policy (for 100% store credit) don't like the hybrid? Exchange it for another. Pay cash if it costs more than the last one or if it's less they give you a gift card for the difference. Great putting green to test out the flat sticks. and they have 4or5 bays to hit balls into nets, complete with computer simulated results on each  shot. Gives you surprisingly accurate visual feedback on the large monitors showing simulated ball flight, along with swing data like club head and ball speed, carry and roll distance, ball spin etc. Huge place! Like Disney Land for golfers.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This place has everything you need for your golf game, and I mean everything. I am mediocre golfer at best, but I was able to build a pretty nice set of TaylorMade clubs out of the used bin for a pretty decent price point. They have a rewards program too which I would recommend taking advantage of if you plan to go there enough. Staff is really friendly and helpful.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<rating>4< /rating><review>Love going to the golf mart, they have a great selection of new and used equipment. My only complaint is that every time I go in and browse through the used wedges, hybrids and drivers, the staff eyes me like a hawk as if I'm going to run off with one of their $50 drivers from 1998.<//review><username>Sean<//username>< Resp>

Best golf shop in the bay area! This place is huge and has a massive selection of every category. Really friendly and knowledgeable staff. And their 90 day satisfaction guarantee cannot be beat! I'd highly recommend this superstore to any golfer.</Text>

< Review>
Talk about your supply and demand. This place has been without a repair tech for almost a month. Various trips to just be told “no one here can do it” or “we have one but he’s off”. What concerns me the most is that there people I have seen for the past 6-8 years working there, that haven’t learned to do grip changes or simple shaft cuts. And the manager can only say “no ones here to do it”. Longest employee here and you can’t provide a customer service to even try to offer a solution. This is a clear example of knowing your market. Since Golfsmith is no longer in San Carlos you have no choice but to deal with this sub par service! Unless you’re willing to go down to PA and visit the PGA store. If you can manage the drive I’d highly recommend going to the PGA store over this place. Your just going to run into one tech who is never there and has so much work to catch up on it’ll take you a week to see your clubs again if you’re lucky! Get it together Golf Mart!<//Review>

< Review>
Front desk manager cast rude looks , short , demeaning & crass one-liners when I enquired as to whether the company had interests in a rather high end set of golf clubs , had "no idea of anywhere in the city" who had any such interest , either.
"Skyler" had no idea before I informed him of a certain Golf Mart store near SSF who had said interest in used golf clubs. He neither acknowledged my information nor said anything further , his other associate replying in his place.
Folks , the most affluent people on this planet have gone through more trial & error , more No's , more dead ends , more "less ingenious" folks you would care to imagine before he/she reached clout city.
People floor me.</Review>

This is a very nice place. Jonathan Romero is really a personable and kind service technician who will patiently take the time to explain and listen. I am also grateful to the “other Jonathan” as I call him for helping me back in January with a particularly challenging problem on my vehicle. I am always able to embark on my long trips with confidence after service is completed here.</review>

I purchased my vehicle from Honda North and use them to maintain it. The service I received was excellent. I recommend them to family and friends. Geovanni, in the service department was very knowledgeable and took great care to ensure my car is running properly.</review>

<Text>Service is not the best.  We made arrangements weeks prior so that they would have the part in for recall.and the morning of the appointment the guy tells us that he has to check to see if they have the part, that it would be quite a little bit before we could get the car back. Obviously we anticipated this and we were supposed to have a loaner which we never got.  So after the fact our SRS light is still illuminated and I have very high doubt that the airbag recall was even fixed.  Considering that what was going to take a substantial amount of time, now only tool 40mins....</Text>< pictures>

Dustin. Service advisor did an outstanding job as usual. I gave them permission to change and replace what ever they daw a need for
Oil and filter change, new wiper blades. Cabin, air and all four brakes looked great no attention needed. They have always been very trust worthy.my wires and three grand daughters ride on this car. They do an excellent job and give it a thorough safety check. They do not take advantage of people and treat everyone with the utmost respect. Jack<//Text>

<review>Their Cheese steaks are the best around! The meat, cheese and buns used are the perfect blend of fresh flavors. Do yourself a favor and get the large sandwich. This is enough for two adults to split or to satisfy a large appetite. The fries are also good. They are made from authentic potatoes and it is reflected in the taste. Last recommendation is their lemonades are deliciously sweet. A nice treat to round out the meal.<//review>< Rate>

< Review>
My husband and I had a very pleasant trip here. The staff is welcoming and friendly. We’ve never been to a Charley’s before and the cashier Janell was very helpful in helping us make our selections and telling us about the combo deals. I got the chicken philly and my husband the Philly cheesesteak. Amazing! We both got combo meals with drinks and fries and my husband upgraded to the one with wings. Everything was delicious! The store was very clean and well managed. A+ for us! We will definitely be back!< /Review>

Negative into positive!

I believe the manager who helped us was named Evelyn. Here is my experience:

I placed my order for 2 classic 10piece wing combos and a small Philly no mushroom.

I was told when I came back to grab my order that they only have boneless wings, the manager quickly stepped in and offered more wings since I was charged for classic. I accepted the offer. I grabbed my food and got home only to realize I was missing both orders of fries and the cheese steak 😒. I drove back to Charleys and was allowed to keep my previous order, have a new order remade, and was fully refunded with a free sandwich coupon. This manager has amazing customer service. Because of her I will be returning.<//review>

Very helpful and happy employees, manager (Destiny) did a great job of attending everyone asking without being evasive if everything was to our liking! Super clean restaurant and plenty of napkins, straws! Clean floors, bathroom and kitchen area, I observed the manager assist the staff and taking the time to show them proper technic in preparing our food!

I Recommend this location 100%, the food was plenty and freshly made!

Going back soon...< /review>

<text>I really like Charley's Philly steaks. We got the roast beef cheesesteak, and it was really good. I enjoy the fact that they put lettuce and tomato on it, and they cook the meat to perfection. I would suggest that you get the grilled onions grilled peppers as well, as they just add to the already wonderfulness that is a Charley's Philly steak. Definitely recommended.< /text>< Pictures>

I love their teriyaki wings and the Chicken California sandwich! I am generally not a sandwich person, but this one was so good I ate the whole thing.
Everything is made when you order it. You have your choice of what you want on your sandwich. It hasn’t been cooked and sitting under a warmer for who knows how long.
The service is very friendly and fast.
All and all it is a great place to eat. Good food, friendly service and it is clean.</text>

We ordered a couple of cheesestakes and some boneless wings.  I really liked their fries too, and options for spicing them up with various toppings.  The food tasted great, and the combo for a sandwich, wings, fries and drink had large portions at a reasonable price for the quality.</Review>

< Review>
Today July 7 2019 around 5-6pm, went into the store and got 2 California regular combos. Only to find out when i got home it had, jalapenos, onions, something that looked like mushrooms and just not a good looking sub with randomness. Very disappointed. Had to dig thru and remove a bunch of stuff only to be left with a dry sub as cheese now gone etc. I come here all the time, won't be coming here. I've noticed the girl that was on the grill non stop talking and having a good time with a guy who looks like a manager, also on the grill. Idk if she was distracted? But yeah no coming here anymore.</Review>

From my understanding this place barely opened on March 19th. Their menu is limited from online and the malls Charley’s . Food was okay could us some more taste . My husband said the staff there wasn’t great just kind of talking amongst the group of them working . He asked for a specific sandwich he always gets and apparently it was unavailable. Not, a great first experience. I love this place at the Mall.</review>

<Review>The last two times have been a mess. Complete lack of customer service on top of messing up the order. They should invest more on customer service training and get rid of these rude employees that can’t even bother to respond when customers thank them. What a joke!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Liam is an amazing host and very knowledgeable about the wines and their history. We did a barrel reserve tasting with him and it was hands down the best I've ever had. Well done. Their wines are amazing. It's a must.<//text>

My first experience was simply delightful! The owner, Dominic, hosted our wine tasting and he and his family/staff were a real pleasure. Their wines are very flavorful, even turning a sweet wine only drinker into a chardonnay purchaser. I'm now a club member and look forward to introducing more of my family and friends to their establishment.<//Review>

<review>The most amazing winery I have ever been to.  Simply precious. I can't wait to get back up there when things settle down. Hope you are all safe, praying for you during this time.< /review>< user>

Very friendly staff and beautiful grounds!  The tasting room is small, yet cozy.  Easy to get to and they're open until 6pm!  Tasting of their current four wines cost $20, unless you purchase a significant amount of bottles.  Bottle prices averaged just under $50.</Text>

<text>We did the Ultimate Tasting Experience and had a great time with Liam (one of the owners). The wines were great, and they had brie, crackers, and prosciutto to go alongside everything. It was fun to try so many wines from the barrel (they offer "futures" to purchase some wines in advance of their production, which we did not do). There were great views of the vineyards around the area, and we got to say hi to the vineyard dog, Carolina, which was a plus!< /text>< pics>

<Text>We had Madison for a legacy tasting and we can't speaking highly enough. The property is beautiful and the wine club has so many perks that we just had to sign up immediately. The wines are really complex and well rounded, we took 2 cases home.< /Text><Name>Kate Albee</Name><rate>5<//rate><Resp>None</Resp><date>1594581425848< /date></record></dataset><record>

Came here with some friends after running the Cloverdale half marathon, boy is it a beautiful property.  The parking situation is a bit strange, they don't have any designated spaces except on handicap space.  So you either have to park along side the driveway or do what most people do and back in between the vines.  The tasting experience here was very pleasant, thankfully our friends are club members so we were able to relax down by the pool.
The staff made it feel more like a hangout than a proper tasting which was really nice.  We were able to just take our time and enjoy the wine, the property, and the company.  The wines were all pretty enjoyable, but were a bit too light for my taste.  We didn't end up purchasing any bottles this time, but would consider buying some in the future.  One of the strangest things to me was that to join the wine club didn't offer any discounts on the wine.  It was more like they are trying to sell a membership to their property instead of focusing on the wine.  Definitely would be worth joining if you are a local, or within an hour or so.  But, for someone like me who enjoys buying and aging wine it didn't seem like a good sell.<//Text>

We discovered this winery several years ago and they are WONDERFUL. We held a birthday party there, full with extended picnic on their patio, guitar-playing and swimming in their pool. Hard to find a more friendly, laid back place with such great wine!< /review>

<Text>Fantastic wine, I loved the pinot (and I don't normally drink a Syrah) but the old vine Syrah was the best I'd ever tasted.  Beautiful location, we sat on the deck by the pool drinking wine and watched the sun go down over the rolling, misted vineyards of California.  Wonderful experience, hope to be back soon.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808416f67192355f:0xc33e8f384e7613e2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>RIP Christopher Creek as we knew it. We came here years ago when CC was still under the original ownership. Back then we were absolutely impressed by the personable service, the friendly low key atmosphere and the Cab. Well, several years later although the buildings are the same, the wine and atmosphere is not. Although the guys working the tasting room were friendly and the wine was okay, we were underwhelmed and the prices are ridiculous. We met one of the new owners, who had quite a snobbish air about him. They seem to be all about pushing membership and catering towards the members only. We left there feeling disappointed, like this winery has turned into a money grab more typical of the Napa wineries. They were out of the Cab, too.</text>< user>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>This place is dirty. The machines are regularly broken and once broken they stay broken for a very long time...
The machines are nasty and the employees just dont care. No one wipes the machines down but one reason is because the gym is always out of paper towels to clean. I literally watched a man try to get a paper towel to clean his machine but as always it was empty. One of the younger female employees walked over to the same paper towel dispenser and tried to get one bit of course it was out. Instead of putting some In the damn machine she literally took one out of the trash next to it. Then a few minutes later another guy tried but actually complained that it was empty to staff. It was never stocked while I was there.

The employees dont care at all about clients or cleanliness. All they do is stand at the front drinking their energy drinks while flirting with each other or texting.

Theres no wifi... you better like the horrific rap music they are always blasting because the wifi is " never available ". So you cant even listen to pandora or something non offensive.

They are always canceling classes. You basically have to come during business hours if you want to do a class. And of course most people work during business hours.

Nearly every day you'll hear people complain they are having to fight the gym because they were double charged...

Just stay with or go back to InShape... it's much better, cleaner, and has wifi.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5JH3Wx3qyqTswCjt1tPtKUW7iTH-u94QeBkku=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg3Y0BQBNKvQc15Ojdha6oeLbANa-XW_-FdqMt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Excellent gym nice atmosphere plenty of machines to cover every muscle group in my work out. One item I’d like to see repaired is some machines with cables have where around the outside plastic area that protects the inner cable....other then that the people who attend this gym are respectful and open to conversation, and last item more people need to wipe machines down after use, I have found to many sweaty benches...yuk......peace<//Review>

<review>Large, roomy, and lots of great equipment. Prices are good and staff is helpful. They go down a star for a lack of paper towels or rags to wipe down with and having no fans at all in the gym. It gets super hot by the treadmills especially. A few industrial fans would go a long way.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Very dishonest and unreliable company. Want to talk to corporate? Good luck there isn't one! This location is ran by a hideous lady that tries to dress like shes a teenager. Can't fix that face with plastic surgery. I hope this company goes down the drain because they got sued for $1.8 Million last year for unfair business practices and changed the name. SHADY do not give them any of your information.< /Review>< Pictures>

I love this gym!! Its large, clean and it seems that only people serious about working out come here. I have not run into anyone that is creepy or disrespectful. I joined because of the boot camp classes that are offered which are absolutely amazing!! There are a few trainers but by far Stephen is the best! He genuinely cares about the benefits members get out of the class. He is very watchful of everyone which surely cant be easy due to the size of the classes but he is constantly there making sure no one has bad form causing themselves injury. He has a great energy that gets you motivated to keep pushing thru class. There aren't many trainers that actively engage but Stephen's passion for fitness is genuine. You gotta check his classes out! THANK YOU Fit Republic for bringing Stephen back - BEST DECISION you could have made for your members!!

Side note, my 4 star rating is ONLY because of the bathrooms. Theres always 2-3 stalls out of order and the stalls are always messy. Bathrooms could be cleaner.<//review>

I like this gym, but I'm seriously  thinking about cancelling my membership because this place is always super dirty.  The floor is gross, when I lay down on the mats I can see hair balls,dust, and even dead bugs. I did the class for 2 years and through that time I always complained at the front desk about how dirty it is, but no one ever did anything, I just dropped the class this month because I  can not take it anymore.  PLEASE CLEAN!!!!!!< /review>

< Review>
7.50pm - rushing through the orders 4 footlong subs. She didn't accept any card only cash. She forgot to give me the receipt but I waited until the others got served. She was a little bit rude. She tried to rip us off not giving our cashback back and used the excuse 'oh we're closing'.
We look up subway neer me and found out that the subway was supposed to close at 9.<//Review>

Jared is a creep and a terrible person. I love the flatbread with eggs, pepperoni, ranch, baby spinach, onions, jalapenos, avocados, and chipotle sauce.</Review>

<Text>Ordered a veggie patties footling. Didn't bother to ask what bread I wanted and ASSUMED that I wanted Italian bread. Took it out and was about to cut it when I was like "hey!what bread is that". Annoyingly said Italian. I was like ok. And then she said what kind of meat. I said "just told you veggie pattie". Now she continues to tell me that they don't have veggie pattie. N I was like "why didn't u say that earlier!" .. so the one thing she is supposed to ask(the bread choice) she assumed it! and the other thing she was told(the meat choice),she didn't hear it.

<Review>I waited. in line 40 mins. There were 6 people ahead of me. Liz was extremely slow with making our subs due to the fact They had a new hire attempting to work the register. So she had to go back and forth. The manager was in the back doing god knows what the entire time. The breads were hard. The softest bread they had was hardly soft. The knife was not cutting through. I was going to get a footlong but opted for a 6 inch since i knew the bread would be hard like a rock if saved. They need to  better train their employees. Place them where they are best served when their is a rush instead of sitting there training them while we wait. Only rodrigo followed the subway formula. I had to ask liz to remove the extra veggies she placed on my 6 inch. 6 pickles is wayyy to many. The subway formula is input for a reason i prefer that way not the liz way. This was the worst subway i have ever been to. My fellow co workers went panda and were able to choose their food, purchase, and eat all by the time i was able to even place my order. HORRIBLE SERVICE. TEERIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PLACE!!! DO NOT GO HERE. PERIOD!!!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

This subway has the most friendly staff I have ever experienced in a Subway before. This subway is in the back of the gas station.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible attention
The employee wanted to charge me 15 dollars for a sandwich, a medium soda and some sabritas. aPart nolo did as we ordered. In the end he charged the pure sandwich for almost 10 dollars that the regular goitre was 7 dollars.

Horrible!! Customer service from the food service!! Waited 40 minutes to get my breakfast! which is totally fine I understand they get busy!! what's not ok they make two of my items then call my number I go to get my food and she says where out of gravy for my two orders, I ask her why would she not tell me that before she made my two, she goes on to ask if I wanting anything else! top my surprise and thinking how backwards she is, I ask why wouldn't you tell me this before you made part of my food so the whole order would be warm!! The whole time she is mumbling under her breath and complaining about her job!! there where 4 other people ahead of me who complained as well. Then I procced to make a complaint and I'm told the manager takes those and he isn't here tell Monday!! and she took my info and said he would call me!! I got no phone call on Monday, So either the manager didn't get the info or they don't care!!<//review>< Date>

<text>I arrived in the late evening and the store had no customers other that those getting gas. The store was clean and stocked, but the clerk wasn't exact friendly, yet nor was he rude. He did the transaction like he had the other 100,000, or that would be the appearance. The restroom was stocked and clean.<//text>< rating>

<Text>Originally a business owner by three guys who wanted a neighborhood gathering place, this place used to be a great place to get gas and buy a few things on your way to work or home, this place has turned into a cluttered mess. The prices have always been a bit high, but gas prices here are typically the highest in town. The staff is not as helpful or friendly as they once were. The regular customers in the morning while friendly, combine with the horrible layout of the store to make shopping here practically impossible. My overall impression of this place now is to avoid it if you can, and don't even try before 9am.<//Text>< Pictures>

If I could give it zero stars I would. They couldn't have been less helpful and the worker with the jacked up grille and glasses was straight up rude and disrespectful. I'm never getting gas here again. I'd rather push my car than give them my business.</review>

I haven't tried the food but the Cashiers have very poor people skills and poor customer service. Not friendly at all. One of them looks upset all the time. Not welcoming at all.< /Review>

This place SUCKS. The staff seemed more interested in having their own conversation instead of giving good customer service and the food is subpar and way over priced. $2.50 a taco and you dont even get any cilantro, onion, or lemon? WOW!! King Taco is cheaper per taco and you get way more stuff. I won't be back< /review>

<review>I have many tacos in my life, but The Los Jalapeños  have the best Carne asada tacos and al pastor...very tasty tacos. Carne asada is full of flavor and very tender. The al pastor meat you can taste the spices which make it very yummy:)...service is slow , but the food is worth it.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Good food.  Guac needs a little work, and the shredded carne asada is a bit of a challenge with some plates, but it all taste goodlicious.  Prices are very reasonable.<//review>

The prices are really good and the have different days with different sales..I like to order FISH TACOS on Thursday!! A lot of us from the facility I work at will pre order them & they have them ready

<Review>If I have the option to NOT add a star, I wouldn't! First off the customer service was horrible, I ordered two orders of the number 13's which are 4 tacos, the wait for eight tacos was 20 min, the workers / cooks were  huddled up  standing there laughing and talking about God knows what, the counters were layerd with grease the restroom  was not well-maintained  Their floors walls and bar  had onions, hot sauce sprinkled and splattered all over the floor  I will never nor will I ever recommend anyone to this hell whole after 20 long minutes of wait  I finally received my tacos took two bites and threw the order away  The food was undercooked and I don't want to wait another 20 minutes to receive a refund.  This place has poor communication skills, Poor housekeeping and most importantly poor management skills</Review><resp>None<//resp><time>1454197924561<//time>< UserId.>

<review>They were great . Food is always great and fresh. Everytime I eat here, it rinds me of Hawaii. We are years , I mean , years ago at the original in Oahu, Hawaii.  It was in the older part of The city. All the locals recommended it as the best local food. Love it they put one in my town. Always fresh and tasty. Even when they are busy, the always say "Aloha", which means hello ,with kindness.< /review><gmapID>0x80900db2c0048f51:0x6afd6da8e47022de< /gmapID>< date>

My favorite place to eat. I'm currently trying to eat healthier but I couldn't help it, I had to get a Spam Mitsubi. (I know I spelled it wrong.) This is the garlic shrimp salad. We will continue eating here as long they are open. Their staff are great as well. 👍< /text>

Usually prefer ordering the BBQ mix/chicken/ or BBQ beef with all rice and no macaroni. Pretty good portions for the meat, so plates are quite filling for less than $10. Overall, pretty good spot to get some grub.</review>

Chicken was overcooked, & taste was off somehow. Just wasn't "right". Maybe because I am used to a different group of L&Ls.</Text>

Ordered chicken combo from doordash and got burnt chicken. Tried to power through the burnt taste cause I was starving but had to stop. Wasn't that hungry enough to eat burnt food. The rice and macaroni salad were amazing but the main course was really bad.<//review>

<text>I visited this place with my son and we got two orders of the rigs with rice and potato salad. My order was fine, but there was an issue with the second order. The short ribs in first order were two partial slabs with the connected ribs and the flap of meat alongside. The second order had one partial slab with ony rib bones and connecting meat but the meaty slab absent. Basically it was half of the meat it should have had.  Despite that , we went back and told the girl at the counter about the problem. Her response was a cold  "Next time order something else".  My son and I both felt insulted and demeaned. I will never return to this place,  I  prefer Ono's  at Sherwood Mall now  as they give a good portion and treat us well.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<review>Avoid it at any cost! Good so dry can’t even chew it , over cooked , burnt , Ana at register helped me , I got the bbq mix to go, came home and could not even believe what it tasted like, I like L&L but this experience made me change my mind forever , called the store and was not even offered a simple sorry and the shift leader kept saying you need to have a receipt and the girl at register remembered me as I gave a$100. Bill however kept making fun of me thinking the phone was on mute and disgracefully did not take any consideration about customer service.</review></record></dataset><record>

I love the food but when you order takeout they forget some of your items. Check your orders! They are open until 8:30p.m. on some days and start cleaning 45 minutes early and don't allow you to dine in. They clean around you and make it really uncomfortable. Last night a man was ordering and one of the workers asked him to get off the rug at counter so she could sweep it at 7:45. She could have waited until he finished ordering. Then asked a little girl to move from her seat while her dad was ordering food so she could sweep under the table. It was very rude. As I said food is good when the order is right but horrible customer service.<//text>

Decent food. Decent prices. Don't like that they keep their doors open and still accept orders but make it plain as day they want you gone. Just set you closing a half hour earlier, or stop taking orders before you want to be physically closed. Its like the people running the place have never worked in a restaurant before.<//review>

I ordered roast pork. No macaroni, all rice. I got roast pork all macaroni. There was so much macaroni. It was on the entire plate even under the roast. It was a food nightmare. Bad. If your getting food for take out, check your order before leaving.< /Text>

Living in San Joaquin County you figure on the only place to find a pork bun would require a 2.5 hour drive West and a ridiculous $6 bridge toll to get to San Francisco in order to get one. But. Alas. There is L&L Hawaiian BBQ to fulfill that. Most of their food is great. I just do not eat Spam and others love it. The one thing I can say. If the place smelled like Spam I wouldn't go inside no matter how bad my craving for a pork bun was! However. It doesn't smell like that. And so I will continue to eat there!</text>

<Text>There is so much selection which keeps me coming back!  Everyone is friendly!  I feel that the portions are ample and more than satisfying!
The dining area is clean and spacious!  You don't feel like sardines in a can of you want to dine in.  You get your own drinks and sauces like sriracha.
You will see all kinds of people that enjoy eating here and there is something for everyone!< /Text><username>Dorothy M< /username><userid>116616556518960003963< /userid><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

The food here is always excellent, the staff is super nice and helpful. The only provlem I have is that this location is ALWAYS super busy, longer than usual wait times - though that isn't their fault. I personally prefer L&L more than Ono Hawian.< /review>

I continue to eat here because they remain authentic. Loco Moco is the best.  The other place has no Loco Moco so they can't be Hawaiian. Best place in town if you want Hawaiian<//review>

Awesome food.  Great atmosphere. Fun college crowd. The food is always fresh. Great selection. Great prices. Good serving sizes. Not a lot of close parking available but we'll worth the small walk. Never very long waits and you can call in your orders in ahead of time. Always a Great place to eat.</Text>

I love their food, especially the pulled pork. A very college vibe being close to UOP.  Staff have always been friendly.  Good spot!</review>

We come here for lunch all the time. Almost don't have to give our order as the girls remember what we get. Very friendly staff, and huge portions. Even when it's busy and packed at lunch time, they are very good at getting your food ready quickly. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get as well. We have tried other so called Hawaiian BBQ places and this location and business is the absolute best!</Text>

<Review>Wanted to try the new meat trio and Turkey bacon sandwich.  They gave us cheese fries which we didn't order. Left the bacon off the Turkey. Forgot the meat trio all together. When my wife went back, they screwed the order up again. Perhaps it would be helpful if at least they spoke English...😎😁😉< /Review><user>110228182136693061412< /user>< Pics>

<username>Nunya Bidness</username><Text>Came here 3 nites in a row. Food as is typical for l and l is always good. Someone needs to come by and train the staff @ this one how to focus on customer service. 1st night i watch my food go from the cook area to the window between and it sits. After four or five orders join it someone moves it to the counter behind the register, and it sits. Then someone places napkins and utensils next to each order. Then they put all the orders in bags. Then the utensils and napkins, then each bag is tied up and the orders sit while someone gets a call in order out. Finally after almost 10 minutes of my food sitting there i ask if it is mine. I finally get my food. Second nite half of tge tables and chairs are pushed to the side while customers stand around with no place to sit. Third nite the person in front of me orders and i step up. The guy behind the counter turns his back on me and shuffles food around on the counter for a couple minutes and finally turns around to take my order. Now, I am sitting here watching my food sitting on the counter in a bag not being handed to me. Fortunately there's another L&L close enough so that I don't have to come back here again...</Text><UserId.>102162496530243479729<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

One of the few places I go to where I can eat away my desires of one of the best food joints in Stockton. The atomosphere inside of this eatery, how may I explain it without being too bland. The interior doesn't matter, what matters is the aroma that hits you when you reach near the door, a overwhelming sensations strikes your stomach with a blow. The staff are nice and may be a bit stiff but it's Stockton what can I say. The establishment may be in a small area where crime is lingering but the chances of having a bad time will be low.

The prices may differ in many people, but the quantity of how much you're receiving is outstanding. Having a mix of the BBQ platter for 10 dollars with how much you're receiving sets you full for an entire day. They of course have chicken, pork platters as well almost if not the same price. Their menu has a lot to choose from and if you'd like a variety then this is the place to go if visiting. Whenever I get the chance for some pleasure food I'd usually come here.

Just a small tip. They do, do doordash, but I would rather drive there for a take out. Delivery fee comes out to 4.99-5.99 with one mix platter or a platter your order comes out to 20 dollars already. Don't get it delivered, expand and meet others going to the restaurant you won't regret it.</Text>

<text>Food is tasty and staff are friendly. A bit on the slower side but I don't mind since the food is fresh. However, I did ask for them to make sure our order had extra sauce added. Nope!!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

One negative comment would be that it takes a couple of calls for someone to finally pick up to take my to go order. It's actually really annoying that they disconnected their phone lines after the fourth call I made just to place an order. When I came into the restaurant I mentioned to the cashier, he looked at me weird and didn't even say sorry. If this continues, I will stop coming here every week and look elsewhere.<//text>

< Review>
Let me start off by saying that the food was wonderful. It's a new experience me which makes it a shame to be treated the way that I was. With that being said normally if I get upset I just keep it to myself when I move along it's rare that I post a review. Went in and I ordered a small order of Katsu  Because I don't know the menu I just went off of what I knew. My friend always gets the Katsu curry but she just calls it Katsu so I always assumed that's what it was. I came in and I ordered my meal and when I opened the Box I noticed that the chicken was dry in there was no curry sauce. I looked at the little girl behind the counter and I said I think they forgot to put sauce on this... She said this is the Katsu chicken it's what you ordered, I said ph shoot you know what I didn't realize there were different types I like the one that has the sauce on it is there a way I could get that? And she just glared at me for a moment, rolled her eyes and said yes I suppose so but for future reference next time read the menu. Now granted she's right I probably should have read a little deeper into the menu but I just walked in looking for 1 thing and I didn't know any better so I'm sorry for that.  But what I want to know is was my offense really deserving of being scolded? In the end they just brought me a couple of tubs of Katsu gravy and just ported over the top this wasn't that big of a deal I even offered to pay more if it cost more I truly felt like I was being an inconvenience.  With that being said I will return to the restaurant because I did like the food very much, and even though I had a negative experience I also know that 1 experience does not define an entire restaurant. So I am certainly willing to give it another try I just hope that this particular girl learns how to treat people a little bit better not just from a professional standpoint but a little kindness goes far in life as well.</Review>

<text>Always great food fast.
I love the bar-b-q meats.
But my favorite after my morning work out at in Shape is the healthy garlic shrimp salad.
The prawns are always perfectly cooked as well as the broccoli. Never over cooked.</text>< Pics>

no offense to the restaurant itself, because they have good food and pretty good service, the only issue I'm having and as to why I only gave four stars is because the parking sucks and it is inconveniently located. They would have five stars if they were located in an area that didn't have that bad parking or limited parking.<//review>

I always get their pork lau lau (a pork chunk wrapped in taro leaves) and kalua pork combo. So yummy. Comes with macaroni salad and rice. Also like to get their spam musubi. Their malasadas (basically fried donut hole covered in sugar) are delicious as well.</Text>

I did not like the food. If u want Hawaiian food try Koala Bear Grill and More in Galt. You will not be disappointed & will not want any other Hawaiian food in this area.<//text>

Was taking way too long for my food . Found out they had catering order to feel for some one . I walked in for a nice quik plate 🤣 ended up being 28 min before I got my food 🤔 you would think they have another cook handy to make sure coustmer got a decent service in time some people are on a time limit first and last time I'm going. PS my chicken had burnt soy sauce and teriyaki sauce all over it was not that good 😫 suck a friend recommended . I brought it up to some one all can say is sorry I'm sure the are  🤐<//Text>

Great food at reasonable price. You get a free drink if you are a student at Delta. Not sure if a Mustang pass is required or not. And they give you SO MUCH FOOD! Im a heavy guy and I couldn't finish it, but man I wanted to! They have an amazing BBQ sause. My chicken was cooked perfect. Super happy, will be back soon.</Text>

L and L is authentic! Not that Ono junk, this is the real deal. Perfect gravy and macaroni salad made fresh daily. If you want real Hawaiian food give thus place a try - I strongly suggest the Loco Mock, with a generous squeeze of Srirachi sauce.<//text>

This place is not open terribly late, which makes coming here to enjoy the delicious offerings all the more precious. Everything is reasonably priced, the serving portions are generous for the meals, and the sides are healthy portions. But if you're a creep like me and the Loco Moco is delicious but you could do without the meat, you can order the rice, the mac salad, and the delectable gravy itself, all separately to combine yourself. You can even order a single egg if you want, cooked how you like it. The ability here to custom order is incredible. The saimin-a noodle dish with meat of your choice and green onions- is beyond tasty, and a personal favorite of mine. The chicken Katsu here (a fried chicken dish) is clearly their most popular order. Choose from a diverse menu with large enough print so you won't have to squint. They're always playing relaxing Hawaiian/reggae style music here, and it's always got an atmostphere of peace despite how busy it can sometimes get. Come on over!< /review>

<text>Authentic and fresh. Way better than the other Hawaiian chain in town. They have delicious extras not even on the regular menu, like lumpia and gyoza. Recommend trying the daily specials as well, always nice to try something new on the cheap.</text>< date>

The original Hawaiian BBQ! Food is authentic and fabulous! The short ribs are my favorite of the bunch. The chicken katsu is to die for. All of which are 10x better than Ono!

Do not forget to try their coconut dessert, Haupia!<//Review>

The Lau Lau combo is always my favorite. The music Playlist was on hit. The vibe was just so calming and peaceful. Kinda felt like I was drifting away on a Hawaiian raft made of leis and ukuleles surrounded by nothing but the sweet aroma of insanely delicious bbq smoke. There was not actually smoke in the restaurant but if there was I would definitely not mind it. Eat here and you won't regret a thing. Like the Hawaiians always say.
