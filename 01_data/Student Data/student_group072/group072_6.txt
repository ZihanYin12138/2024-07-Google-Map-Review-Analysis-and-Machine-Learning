First time trying this place near where I live.
It was pretty good! The salad was very tasty. I ordered the chopped chicken salad and it was nicely made, with great flavor. I also ordered the bruschetta special appetizer - it didn’t have amazing flavor but it was definitely good enough for the special price. I got my son a 10” pizza with pepperoni - the sauce was good! The pepperoni was good quality and overall everything tasted good. I left full and happy. Thanks Crust - I’ll be back.<//Text>

<text>So good! Very friendly staff. I'm not gluten free, but the gluten free crust was so good. I highly recommend. The wait staff are constantly walking around, checking on you, and stopping by to see how you are. If I lived closer this would be a regular place for my family. However my parents live there and they eat here often. Definitely worth your time.< /text><user>108223895737821355761< /user><Resp>None<//Resp>< username>

We wanted to Celebrate my daughter's birthday so decided to give this place a try. Couldn't have chosen a better place. We ordered wings, pizza, and pastas. My wife got the big sexy one it was so good. I had the Kelley pizza pretty good. The wings were perfectly cooked and just the right amount of sauce. Besides the food being delicious the staff went above and beyond. They were so friendly and courteous. We had just about the whole Crew drop by our table to check on us. 1/22/21 who ever worked tonight you guys rocked. My family had such a good time and your Customer service is 110%! Will definitely be back.

<Review>We did in and finished everything so fast that we didn't get any pictures. The pizzas were amazing! The crust was chewy perfection. The wings had just a little heat to them and were finger licking good.  This restaurant just moved up a few places in our go to list.< /Review><Time>1607906844915< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80dc0b0bd5fcaea5:0xcbe86cc280ab10e4</Gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>A A</user_name>< userid>

The only thing better than the food is the service. This place has the vibe of a family run restaurant but a modern and hip look and feel. Awesome 5$ margaritas on happy hour, huge appetizers and salads, delicious pizza. Lots of regulars here, we eat there once a week.</Text>

Despite Crust being extremely busy on a Wednesday evening our server and other waitstaff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The Caprese salad was refreshing with the dressed arugula on the top in addition to the usual fresh mozzarella,  tomato slices and balsamic reduction. The pizza crust was crisp on the bottom with great texture and taste. The toppings of mushrooms,  roasted red peppers and carmelized onions was a perfect pairing for the salad and glass of wine.</review>

First visit with the girlfriend. She had the cheese lasagna and I had the penne pasta. Food was very good, however it is not the quality or quantity e,elected for what they charge.  The service was horrible. We were seated within a few minutes of walking in, but it took 10 minutes just to get a drink order and the server was absent a large amount of the time. We had to wait long lengths of time for literally everything including drink refills, our food in general and even the check. We requested a takeout box and were brought it 15 minutes later and then had to wait another 15 minutes for the check.  Thus was during a slow time and not peak hours, so I see no excuse for the lack of service. I give this place food 3 1/2 stars out of 5, but the service is maybe 2 if I'm being generous.<//text>

It just gets better & better. I started eating here shortly after it's opening about a year ago and was wowed by it's amazing pizza, the best I've had anywhere.  Well, that continues to be true and it doesn't stop there.  I fell in love with the spicy meatballs, the roasted artichoke appetizer, the spaghetti & meatballs and their host of lunch & dinner salads, all available with steak, chicken or my favorite, the new spicy blackened chicken.

Once again they've stepped up their game, adding amazing daily homemade soups and my absolute favorite ever salad, their "wedge".  It's a classic, with iceberg lettuce wedges (yes, plural...read HUGE), bacon, cherry tomatoes and a heavenly blue cheese dressing oozing around like white liquid gold. I top it with the blackened chicken and love it!  It's way too big but it doesn't stop me from eating the WHOLE thing, good thing I usually have a pal along to roll me out!

They also have a nice selection of craft beers and great wine at reasonable prices, all served by a young, cheerful & attractive staff.  So I only have two questions:

1. Can it get any better?
2. Why are you reading this when you could be there eating?

Now I've done it....I'm gettin' in my car and heading there NOW.<//Text>

Horrible service. Hostess went to her car to grab something and didn't appear to be clocked in. Then another came and seated us.  We sat there and waited as three tables who'd been sitting there since before we got there finished eating and left. Then a waitress proceeded to help a table who'd already been served and didn't bother asking if we'd been helped yet. The only person I found helpful was the busser who brought us water immediately after sitting down. The next thing is this place is ridiculously priced!!! They charge you for splitting a check! And thirdly they have this little postcard asking you to vote for them for best pizza and best bartender; they're service took so long my boyfriend and I left before we even got to taste the pizza and their bar?!?!?! They only serve beer an wine!!!!  The place is a joke....< /Text>

Service is subpar. The moment I walked through the door, not a single employee cared to make eye contact, much less make their way towards me. I would've been more understanding if the restaurant was filled, not just the single occupied table and the other customer at the bar.

When the customer that was chatting with the bartender noticed me, he asked her if she was going to help me and she said no, that someone else could take care of me instead. Foolish to think I didn't hear you bartender. I waited another 5 minutes before someone else finally approached me and then asked me if the bartender had helped me; apparently IT WAS the bartender's job to acknowledge me. Needless to say visiting this place was a rather underwhelming experience.</review>

<Review>First time and we weren't disappointed. The "Big Sexy" pasta was excellent with a wonderful mix of gouda and cheddar along with sausage, bacon & jalapeños. The gluten free pizza crust was tasty & crispy. The only issue was the noise level but it wasn't any different than most other places these days. We'll definitely be back and send friends here.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

This Pizzeria has great food and service, We had 7 people at the table and everyone's pizza was delicious. Additionally,  the chicken parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs were excellent. As far as service goes, we had an outstanding waitress named Devin. If you can get her table, do so. You won't be disappointed.
An all around excellent dining experience!!<//text>

I'm there two to three times a week. Everybody there is awesome and knows my name/drink. Fantastic service and the food is pretty awesome too.
The Elle is the best pizza, if you like spicy ladies.< /text>

<review>There was not one enjoyable thing about eating here. 1st we were Sat next to the door to outside which the waiters came in and out of constantly (it was cold). When we asked to sit somewhere else they said we would have to wait instead of just moving the table a few feet. The waitress was largely absent (took 30 min to order food, forgot several requested items). When we finally got our pizza 50 minutes after being seated it was totally burnt. Awful experience.  Do not recommend this place at all.</review>< Pics>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>Food was good, but service was terrible. We had called in a reservation, but when we arrived they said they didn't have it. Saw it on a note next to their phone with all the details and called them out on it. They didn't care.

Waited 45 mins for a table, then nearly 30 mins for a starter salad. When questioned about the salad after about 20 mins, our server gave a snarky reply that they have to cook the chicken on the salad, so it's not a 15 minute salad. Mmkay. Another 15 mins or so for food to start coming in waves.

One of the dishes that was supposed to be vegetarian showed up with sausage or ground beef in it. When we meet the server know, she didn't apologize and say let me go fix that for you. Instead she argued that it shouldn't have meat in it (obviously it shouldn't based on the menu description). She did get it remade quickly, and it was good, but she really needs to work on her customer service skills.

It's really a shame that the service was so bad here. What should have been a great family get together, was turned into a frustrating experience. Again, we all enjoyed our food, but I definitely won't be back next time I'm in town.< /Text>< pics>

One of the top 5 Best pizzas, I’ve ever had! The best pizza I’ve ever had, in all of Noth County! Order the Kelly, you won’t be sorry! The best crust, Best sauce and best meats, you can find on a pizza, without going to Italy, or NYC! I’ll be bk! I use to eat at your uppercrust Tucson location, and this pizza is by far superior! Glad I moved to San Elijo Hills, from the Catalina Foothills (Tucson AZ), now I’m only 3.8 Miles from you guys! Thanks for the great quality pizza, near my house!

<review>The food was OK. However, this is the filthiest restaurant we have been in for a long time. 2 of the 4 plates on the table looked like they literally hadn't been washed. Ok, that happens. There was food in various spots all over the floor, and a crayon. The tables all looked like they were wiped with a dirty rag. We were there at 3:30 on Sat afternoon 7-12, and one of only three tables being served, so it's not like it was in the midst of a meal rush, and nobody had time to push a broom for 5 minutes. We kept waiting to see if a server would at least pick up the crayon so they would slip on it. Nope. Two people with a $50 before tip lunch tab-sorry, but I'd rather eat somewhere with a cleanliness standard. Back to Blue Ribbon Pizza in Encinitas now, for our pizza fix. Or Leucadia pizza. Wish people took pride in their establishments-we were hoping it would be good, but pretty disappointed.</review>< pictures>

My time spent inside "Crust" was less than 5 minutes. I simply picked up a pizza to go.  I inhaled the environment of "Crust" in those few minutes.

The 5 stars I gave was 95 percent for the pizza and 5 percent for my short experience inside and over the phone ordering.

If your a serious pizza lover that appreciates quality and taste, this place is top tier for you.  Traveling often for business I get around the US and can tell you "Crust" is in the top 10 percent. (Been to NY and Chicago, interesting enough, and never had time to get pizza)

I created my own pizza.
I had a 10" pizza with Artisan crust (regular), Wisconsin mozzarella cheese, Portobello mushrooms, black olives and onions. My total was 14.85 and that was for two people. No complaints, your getting quality.  First and final opinion is this place has great pizza.  The only local pizza equal is "Marco's" in Vista, CA.

I will come here again, and I live in San Marcos 6 miles away.

The environment inside made me think i was inside"Chipotle" with servers and a bar added. That is not saying a bad thing. I am just  describing the inside as best I can. Wide beer and wine selection.  I interacted with three employees and they were all friendly. Others will probably disagree, but I PERSONALLY would not go there with a group bigger than 6. Customer service over the phone for the order was great. Plenty of parking.

Pizzaholic tourists getting the "shakes" should definitely go here if in Carlsbad, CA.</Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I would rate this company negative if it was an option. The company and the doors/product is horrible. We purchased three exterior doors from this company and all three have leaking issues. They are poorly constructed and the company will NOT stand behind their product. And because of these issues we have major damages to our wood floors.  We have reached out to them via phone, email and all form of communications but they just give the run around or a poor lame excuse why the doors leak. We have been trying to resolve this matter and get a refund for just the doors not the damages for over 7 months and still waiting!! The customer care team or any of their reps will not respond back. So if you are purchasing and are out of the state of California, where they are located, I HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest you look at a nationwide manufacturer like Kolbe, Pella, etc.that have local showrooms or reps that you can contact.<//Review>< Pics>

Renovating and needed new doors (both interior and exterior). ETO came through on getting us some quality doors. They stood out, much better when compared to the other big box stores. Would highly recommend their door selection !!!!!< /Text>

Our new door is absolutely beautiful!  Worked with Esther and she was able to find what we were looking for at a great price.  We were quoted 4-5 weeks for production plus delivery.  Our new door was delivered to our home 4 weeks & 1 day from the order date.  Our contractor told us that he felt the quality of the door was better than some he has installed that were 2 or 3 times more expensive.  This was a great experience from start to finish, we highly recommend ETO Doors.  I BIG thank you to Esther for making it all happen!</text>

<text>We had a really good experience with ETO doors.  At first, we are extremely nervous about ordering such an expensive product online, but after working with Esther on the details and even a a few potential changes that we wanted it worked out. The door arrived in perfect condition and very well packed. Probably the hardest part is getting the contractor to install it in time and to protect the door from humidity.  I would highly recommend ETO doors, it'll probably save you a bunch of money and get you a nice product.< /text>< Pics>

<text>After doing some research, we decided to buy our interior doors through ETO. Was a great decision! The doors are stunning, really stand out. Esther was very helpful throughout the entire buying process. I had some questions about trimming the doors, since I was installing these personally. They were able to help.  Would recommend.<//text>< pics>

<text>The interior stained doors stand out! Really catch your eye. Never had interior stained doors before. Usually, I’d get something more basic from the big box stores, but buying these stained interior doors for our home remodel was not a decision I regretted.

Can’t say enough good things about my interaction with ETO. The doors were made just right. I saw no defects, they really stood out and made an impression. We received our doors in 3 weeks from the day we ordered them. The craftsmanship put into these doors, you can see it.<//Review>

Bought a pre-hung door without any problems. The doors been holding up great since the install. I think their quality is a lot better, and pricing is more reasonable when compared to the larger chains. I’d buy from them again.</Review>

<Review>Read my review on Yelp, or any of the 471 buried reviews on Yelp to get a true understanding of this company's real reputation based upon REAL reviews.  I'm not saying all these glowing reviews are fake....decide that for yourself.   In my experience, nothing short of a terrible company which will ship you the wrong product and/or a product not as represented, will keep your money, and will become unavailable to take or return your calls when something goes wrong.</Review>< pics>

Ordered a few doors, no problems. The dark stain on these really bring out the quality of grains used on these doors. We’ve received a handful of compliments since we installed these. This was my first time ordering, won’t be my last.< /review>

I’ve been using ETO Doors on and off for a few years now. They’ve always done a really good job. Esther is extremely nice and goes out of her way everytime to make sure I’m happy. I’ve ordered online, and been to their warehouse. I would highly recommend the company.< /Review>

<Review>We recently purchased our dream home in Arizona and our contractor recommended using ETO. Art our representative prepared us with all the questions we needed to streamline our decision. We bid with two other companies but ultimately decided on ETO due to the knowledge of our representative and peace of mind that it provided us even if it costs us $200 more than other quotes received. We will be looking into our interior doors next. Here is an image of our exterior double door installed with a transom.</Review><response>None</response><name>Olivia Ruiz< /name>< Gmap_id>

Nick was wonderful. We recently bought a fixer and did the entire home. We ordered our front and interior doors through ETO. Very happy we did. I wouldn’t hesitate in using them twice.</Text>

Nick was great from start to finish. Communication was there from the day we ordered, until the doors were delivered. Shipping was fast and everything was packed to ensure there was no damage during shipping. Thank you.< /text>

<review>I’m not a contractor, but I was making some changes to my home. I first spoke with Esther, then Tyler. Both were extremely helpful. They even mentioned some things I never thought about. I think they did a splendid job from start to finish. If I order doors again, this is where I’ll go.</review></record></dataset><record>

Bought a pre-hung front door from ETO about 5 years ago. The work was top notch. Door is still holding up great with no problems. In my opinion they have a better product at a better price then the big box stores.</Text>

<text>While Esther was very helpful in answering our questions and helping us place an order for a wine cellar door, I had to go ahead and edit this review once my order was received.  The door came with an excessive amount of glue globbed on all around the glass pane which is extremely visible and makes the whole thing look like very poor quality.  When I called customer service to let them know this is how my door arrived (hoping it was just a quality issue I experienced) they let me know that this was their standard product and that my carpenter could go ahead and razor off and pick at the dried up glue - which is by no means my carpenters job.  Very poor response and customer service.  I expected better quality as this was not a cheap purchase.<//text>< gmapID>

Ordered a few interior white primed doors for a project I was working on. They look amazing. You could tell the attention to detail these guys put into the quality of their doors. I had to wait about two weeks until I got my doors, but it was worth it.</text>

I ordered an Alder wood double arched door. It took eight weeks from placing the order to receiving it at my home. I had them build a door frame/jam with matching Alder. The door was shipped via freight and was package very thoroughly and arrived without damage. The door looks amazing with knots and clavos. It will take a couple of months to install it since we haven't yet started construction of the winery. I'm looking forward to seeing it installed and operating.<//review>

The wood interior doors here are absolutely gorgeous. I have a home in Woodland Hills, and placed an order for 7 doors, and they all look great. I’ve received a lot of complements since we had all these installed. Great company, hardworking people and go that extra mile. If you’re within a 200 mile radius of LA, go check out their showroom!< /Text>

I have 14 ETO Door doors with mahogany, both solid and louvered for the closets.  What an excellent choice.  They took a stain well and haven't needed any adjustments in their first year and a half.</Review>

After searching the net and going to several stores like Lowes and HD, we found some quality doors we liked through ETO. It took about 3 weeks for us to get our doors, but they really stood out and you can see the craftsmanship put into the doors. Will do business with the company again, thank you.</text>

Just replaced all our interior doors. We did our purchase through ETO. Was very pleased with how fast they were able to have the doors ready. I picked up the doors, when we got them back to the house and had them all installed I didn’t see any problems with the quality of the doors. They were packed well. Great experience from start to finish.</review>

<review>I bought a mahogany door here from this company, took about 2 weeks to get my door which is fine. According to the sales rep, the doors are made to order. So I can understand the delay in getting the door. I didn’t havef it shipped, I live in Woodland Hills so I went there to pick it up. Paul was great and very helpful. I’d probably use them again.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

We wanted a tall and very wide door with sidelights and our builder gave us a catalog to look through. All of the doors we liked were over $10,000! I asked my daughter who lives in LA to go to the factory and look at the doors. She loved them. We worked with Esther and chose the Paris with custom chipped glass. It arrived in 5 weeks which was what we expected. Our door is stunning! We love it. My husband hung it and it swings like a dream! We are so happy with our door.

< Review>
I’m absolutely in love with the door we ordered from ETO Doors. Christopher was my rep, and he was super helpful.  Especially,  since I’d never ordered doors online and I wanted to make sure I got it right bc I’m out of state. It turned out more beautiful than any door I’ve seen. It is a piece of art.< /Review>

Since I’d never ordered doors before and wasn't sure what i was doing, I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything Luckily I was helped out by Esther and she made sure of that. Esther Ramirez was a great help and took her time explaining everything to me with detail.  I highly recommend this place, and I most definitely will be coming back. I love the door we ordered from ETO Doors, thanks for all the help again Esther.!!! :)</review>

ETO Doors helped us replace the interior doors of the house. They have competitive quote compared to other door companies in my area. Thank you Paul for explaining the differences between doors.< /text>

ETO Doors is AWESOME! I was looking for a place to help me with ordering doors for our home.  I quickly realized that there is a lot more to buying doors than I thought.  When I called ETO Doors, I spoke with Chris.  He asked me things that I had not even thought about.  The one thing that really stuck out to me was the fact they I never felt like I was being pressured to buy anything.  In fact, he was slowing me down and making sure that I was getting the right things I needed.  This was an overall great experience from beginning to end.  I would highly recommend ETO Doors to anyone looking for great quality doors and great quality employees!</text>

I don't usually write negative reviews, so please know that I am only writing this to spare you the experience of dealing with them.
ETO Doors does not value their customers. They do not respond to calls or emails. They do not ensure the quality of their products. Yes, their doors are cheap and well-made. But if they make a mistake on delivery or the custom build (as they did in my case) you will not get a refund or even an apology. You will spend hours of your time trying to reach someone, and no one will help you.
Construction is a difficult process no matter what. But in all my years of home-ownership I have never dealt with a company that cared less about their customers.< /Text>< Pics>

<user_name>Patti Bitzer< /user_name><Review>We are very happy with both the service from Chris and the quality of all our ETO purchased doors.  I believe we are up to 20 doors (including 2-fire rated, 2-front, and 2-patio)  All have been top quality Mahogany arched 2 panel doors and exactly as ordered.  Delivery time is approximately 3 weeks but usually comes in a few days sooner.  If you live in the area and have a truck, you can save on shipping and pick up yourselves as we did.  If you want good service and xlnt quality, buy from ETO Doors.<//Review>< pics>

We bought a front impact door for Florida . The door has been on 5 days and it's already warped on top and bottom. Already see light coming in. Response has been non  existent from factory. Production manager name Art takes no responsibility. Their warranty department does answer the emails. And everything was done as per instructions when we got door.  Also the Florida sticker which should come with door never came so permit can't be approved and they did not send yet. Do not buy from these . Yes they are cheaper and you might be lucky like some people but it is not worth giving a company like this money so they can cheat us all.  I would like to post pictures of the door current condition. Now we have to buy another door locally to replace a 3000 dollar door . That only last 5 days .</text>

<text>My company has purchased doors from ETO for a few years now and would have given them a 3 star until our last order. We had an order of 20+ interior doors - the doors took longer than the ETA given and then they were all the wrong style door. They placed the new order over 3 months ago and keep giving us a different eta everytime we ask. We were supposed to receive them about a month ago and we are told 2 more months.

The worst part of it all and the reason for the bad review - their customer service or lack there of. The absolute rudest people on the phone to “try” and help giving us no information. The attitude over there is “it is what it is”. No “we are sorry”. No reason as to why we are months delayed, nothing but attitude. Regardless of their price - it is not worth buying from ETO. BUYERS BEWARE.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>We liked our ETO Mahogany Marina door with Horizontal Aluminum Strips with matching sidelite UNTIL a large horizontal crack appeared 3/4 of the way across only 1-1/2 years afterreceived.  ETO warranty is ONLY 1 year. Now we have to go back to our contractor to see if he will buy us a replacement as ETO said the door was not stained + sealed within 7 days of receipt (per warranty). ETO offers 15% discount which isnt much considering its an expensive, faulty door! The crack will not stop and continues to grow. Try a different door manufacturer.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1578611719707, 'text': "ETO Doors did receive a claim from the customer today (01-09-2020).

For example, if the door was impacted onsite or not treated properly, ETO cannot be responsible.  If the door was defective in any way, the defects would not take over a year to appear.

I searched for a garage door repair service as my spring broke on Sunday. I called a few companies until i reached ETO . They came within 1 hour, examined the issue explained everything to me and got to work immediately. Within an hour or so I had a brand new spring installed. The service was fast and professional. Will definitely use ETO again. Thanks guys!!< /Text>

I called ETO at noon and the door was repaired by 4 - and that was only because *I* couldn't get there sooner!I had a broken spring, and I really appreciated that he didn't try to talk me into other stuff that I didn't need, like so many repair people do. The last time I had something serviced on my garage door, the guy really tried to get me to buy a new garage door opener, insisting mine had ‘six months, tops’. That was ten years ago. I thought this guy would do the same, but he just looked at it and said ‘the new spring is better, so the opener should last longer’.< /review>

<review>So happy with the doors and the level of service. When you order something, you don't always know if you'll get what you thought you'd get and if it will be of high quality, etc. Chris totally took care of us from helping us make the right selection to following up to make sure they were installed to our satisfaction.

I will sure be recommending ETO doors to everyone. Thanks again!!!<//review><rate>5</rate><Gmap_id>0x80c2c62371dd08fd:0x1aec103f0c9fdbe2< /Gmap_id>< date>

We needed an exterior grade door for a wine cellar we are building.  We were able to find a beautiful door from ETO.  During the ordering process I mistakingly choose the wrong jamb size and Esther from ETO was amazing.  She helped me get the order straighten out before the door was shipped.  Can't wait to see the door and put it in place!   Excellent selection & excellent service, can't go wrong with ETO!</text>

<Text>Awesome company. Springs broke on my garage and left a voicemail the night prior to let them know of the issue. Mike contacted me and we setup and appointment between 3-6pm. Arrived during the scheduled time and within 40 minutes, I had new springs, reprogrammed the opener, fixed my cable and even greased the channels. This is without a doubt one of the best companies I have dealt with and will inform everyone about them. Thanks so much.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I cannot say enough about ETO Doors experience. I had been researching replacement doors for months and was pleasantly surprised by the showroom and the patience that Christopher Seminatore showed. He provided solid information about the various products.
Multiple scenarios were presented by Christopher which allowed us to get exactly what we were looking for our hotel Christopher was easily accessible and helpful to establish the contract & kept us updated every step of the way.

Doors arrived for installation on time! Christopher was extremely professional looking at everything . I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!! Doors are gorgeous!!!

Thank you!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

< review>
This company is a rip-off!  I ordered $4600 of custom mahogany doors from ETO Doors in October 2018. They provided a design drawing and an estimated 12-14 week lead time.  In March I still had not received the doors, and after much complaining, they attempted to substitute some shop built doors of very poor quality. I refused to accept delivery of the doors and spent two months trying to get a resolution out of them. In June I demanded a refund, and they refused with no further indication if they would ever deliver the correct doors.  It has now been over eight months and I have filed complaints with the BBB and The Federal Trade Commission.  My next stop is small claims court.<//review>

Great company to deal with,  the door I purchased was super high quality.  Ram was also a great help both when ordering the door and after I received it.  Other companies were over twice the price.<//Review>

Basing upon the Quotation process I received from Esther of ETO doors, it is definitely a 5-star service.  I would give it higher if there is one.  Esther is responsive, professional, thorough, and courtesy.  Esther is considerate and quick in improvement of Lead time.  She went over and beyond call of duty to accommodate our process, diligent in her follow-up effort.  She is a breathe of fresh air in this industry.  Congrats to ETO Doors on having an employee like her.  We placed deposit on our 35 doors order. We choose ETO Doors over 2 other major manufacturers in Southern California.   I look forward to the arrival of finished product.</Review>

<review>I have ordered several front door slabs from ETO. The prices and quality are outstanding! I was a little skeptical on my first order, as I was worried how it would handle abuse of being shipped. I have to say, ETO knows how to pack a door so it arrives in perfect condition! On the sales side the people are very knowledgeable and helpful. I cannot comment on the support side of the service as I have never had any issues with my doors. Give them a try, you will be very pleased with the prices and quality of their products.</review>< rating>

<Review>I saw a lot of doors online through a local ad.  When I saw that they were local, I thought I would come in and see what they had at their office in Los Angeles. Since I recently bought a house, I wanted to get new doors (both interior and for the main, exterior door).  Anyhow, they had great prices and I was really pleased. I'd recommend you check them out.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>DO NOT BUY DOORS FROM ETO DOORS EVER!!!! They are dishonest scammers that do not stand by their product. I ordered over $100,000.00 worth of doors only to have them all come in with rough cut sides that had to be finished and painted not like the sample they sent. They did not bore a lot of the doors correctly and a lot of them had water damage. One solid mahogany door was badly bowed. After being back and forth with them for months they will not offer a single penny to help fix these problems. Only saying that it is my responsibility order more. And now they want to charge me 3 times the original amount for a replacement a defective door. Any issues that come up they will pin back on you and state something from some warranty that was never sent. These guys are total scammers.</review>< Pictures>

<resp>{'time': 1511551409077, 'text': 'ETO Doors has been in business for over 10 years. We sell thousands of doors each month nationwide and globally. This customer’s claims are not true. Some customers use the threat of social media in an attempt to receive a credit or replacement for mistakes they made.\n1.\tOur web-site and order paperwork clearly state that knotty alder doors include “knots.” Most customers prefer the rustic look on knotty alder doors. Please see the pictures and description https://www.etodoors.com/rmka.html/.  The door was not defective.\n2.\tThe pocket doors were not defective. The customer ordered doors with “raised moulding” (see description of job#4, on page 5 of this customer’s order) that could not be used with his pocket door frame.\n3.\tRather than charge the customer for 2 new doors, ETO Doors as a courtesy to the customer, offered and delivered 2 temporary doors and ordered 2 new doors for the customer at no charge. The customer was made aware of the lead time for the 2 new doors. Again, had the customer ordered the doors correctly, there would not have been a delay.\n4.\tETO Doors has spoken to this customer multiple times including this past Tuesday, November 22nd, when the customer’s contractor informed us that they have not even looked for the temporary doors that were delivered and that none of the doors have been installed. Clearly this is the customer’s dishonest attempt to get a credit he does not deserve.\nAgain, this customer made a mistake with ordering his doors. In good faith, ETO Doors replaced all doors free of charge for this customer. 2 of the doors are being custom made and require a longer lead time.

I have been in real estate construction field for over 25 years.  Seldom have ever have I had such terrible service.  Initially I ordered an Alder front door from Ram the salesman. 5 weeks later it showed up with a baseball size knot hole.  When I rejected it, Cynthia told me that many people like a door with a huge knot.  Really?  They expected me to accept a defective door

Then I was told they would send me another door, so I foolishly added 15 interior doors including pocket doors to the first order.  6 weeks later the order was delivered.  I asked Ram where were the pocket doors and frame.  Ram told me the pocket doors were defective and he would reorder the pocket doors.  Additionally the door jams were the cheapest quality.  I had to pay hundreds of additional dollars to have the jams set up correctly.

Another 5 weeks go by and then ETO sent me a freight bill for the pocket doors.  I asked them it they expected me to pay the freight for the defect doors that were not included in the original shipping bill. They did not answer my emails and calls for 3 days regarding the freight bill. On the 4th day I was told the new pocket doors were never ordered.

It has now been about 10 weeks since I originally ordered the pocket doors. I can't finish the dry wall, flooring, sheet rock and painting due to the pocket doors never arriving. ETO is not responding to my requests regarding my additional incurred expenses caused by the doors delay.

Ask Ram in the sales department why the pocket doors in Pleasant Hill had not arrived  10 weeks from the initial order.

After Ram and ETO customer service did not cooperate I went to Belmont Door and Hardware.  I brought the invoice from ETO to order pocket doors.  They were very detailed, professional, and less expensive.  The guy also pointed out to me that Ram did not order all the correct parts on the initial ETO order.  I wasn't surprised to hear this

I am now taking legal action since ETO will not respond or help me. Don't ever use ETO doors unless you want a nightmare and huge delay in your construction project.

I will not be surprised if ETO responds back with a bunch of excuses.  They are great at covering their mistakes.<//Text>

Dealing with the people at ETO doors was a great experience. I had many hurdles to clear due to a shorter door than normal and a log cabin frame to fit it into. They worked with me and asked the right questions to send me a door that fit perfect and looks amazing. Everything you see on the website is what you will receive. I am looking forward to purchasing more doors from them in the future.</Review>

Worst company i had to deal with with the construction of my new house.  My doors arrived 2 months late and 6 months latter see the result on the pictures after being sealed and painted by professionals. ETO Doors will not replace them, only offering me $1,080 discount if i buy new ones for $4,000+. I hired a lawyer but ETO's warranty is written in such a way that i am basically screwed! I can wait to visit them in LA or Vegas on a next business trip...<//Review>

<Review>I purchased all new interior doors made of Knotty Alder. The doors are all beautifully made and look great once stained. The quality of the doors has been great and the prices were some of the best I could find.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Mike made sure the job was done correctly and to my satisfaction. I have no regrets hiring this company. Very happy with their work and would recommend them to my friends and family.

ETO Doors has good prices on good quality products, but on multiple orders they have consistently and repeated slipped their delivery dates by large margins. If you are building a house and actually need doors by the original promise date, look elsewhere.< /review>

Run away from ETO as fast as you can. Horrible experience! They sold me a door that wasn't in stock. 3 weeks later I get a call saying, they don't have the door I want? They offer to up grade me to a door in  mahogany wood. They also tell me the door will still be through production and delivered by the original date. A week and a half after that, I get an email  saying they need a signature for the change order. I promptly email them back a signed change order. Two weeks later no door or delivery date? I start trying to communicate with ETO regarding door status. Nobody returns calls or emails??? On the third day after many call attempts, I finally get the thru. They don't have the second door they told me they where changing me to?
Long story short. I've wasted 5 weeks with these clowns!
My build is delayed and I've got to start the processes from scratch. Hopefully with a reputable company?

update: they haven't credited my card back and its been a full week??<//review>

Had a most excellent experience with ETO.  Having shopped for our new front door for a few months, we could not find the right door at the right price from anyone locally including Home Depot or Lowes!  After scouring the web for companies that sells doors, we found ETO (amongst others).  ETO provided the exact door we were looking for at the best price of all quotes I received.  The process from getting the quotes, to making the order and finally receiving the door to our house was easy and excellent - thank you to all at ETO, including John and Anthony!</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>2 doors were picked up by my wife and had some damage that looks like it is from a forklift on the same position on both doors. Each door has 2 v-shaped indentions in the wood both evenly spaced on one side.

After filing an RMA request ETO simply said the claim was denied because my wife signed the release form. I mentioned that she was pregnant and not physically able to inspect the doors. They did not officially respond to me on the RMA in email and they have not returned my calls back.

As a backup, I attempted to sand these dents out and after some extremely light sanding it is clear the dents are completely through the extremely thin veneer. It is sad that such a good looking product is so cheaply manufactured and that their customer service is refusing to discuss further.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c62371dd08fd:0x1aec103f0c9fdbe2</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a door for a customer whose house we are building. The door was promised with a 5 week lead time. I ordered the door June 27th and awaited August 1st (5 weeks). The door was PRE-PAID $2K +.  I called expecting delivery the week before and was told the door would not ship until 8/14/17 (2 Weeks Late, 7 weeks from order). IT DID NOT SHIP 8/14/17, was told again it would ship "By Friday 8/18/17" - IT DID NOT SHIP 8/18/17, I was told today (I kid you not) "the door is getting ready to ship" WAT? What does that even mean? 8 weeks after a prepaid order, and I do not have a door. DISGUSTING, INCOMPETENT LIARS! I WAS LIED TO 3 DIFFERENT TIMES. NEVER USE THESE PEOPLE... YOUR CUSTOMERS WILL THINK YOU ARE THE LIAR!<//Review>

<review>Don't work with ETO! The DMV seems like heaven compared to dealing with this hapless crew. ETO processed my payment information before I even had a confirmed order. After the  sales guy suddenly informed me the door was 12 weeks back ordered. ( This is a pretty standard single light exterior door.) I decided not to go ahead with the order. Now going on two weeks and I can't get my money back. They put you in a loop, make you fill out more PDF refund request forms, and assure you that "Accounting" will issue a refund receipt.
If you need doors try BMC (used to be Stock) talk to Gus. He was excellent and had the doors I wanted in a week. Plus they don't take full payment until the doors arrive, just a deposit.</review>< Pics>

< Review>
Absolutely horrendous ! If there could be negative start I would leave minus 5 stars !

This company is a disaster, believe every negative review you read, DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY

I ordered two doors, one being a dutch door. Door was delivered in pieces so I had not idea they built in wrong ! Yes they build a dutch door to open on the bottom! Yup, that's right, a dutch door that opens on the bottom ! I called them and got nothing but the run around, on hold for over an hour, told I was getting call back I never got. Then I get someone on the phone and she starts yelling at me ! I said who makes a dutch door to open on the bottom , her response "apparently the idiots who work here" !

They told me my new door would be here twice and they never showed up ! One time the driver was "sick" (they never called me, I had to call them) then they "forgot" to put the door on the truck ! Both times I had the contractor here waiting which cost me money !

All you will get is the run around and frustration. Save yourself the time and aggravation and order from someone local who will handle business in a proper manner.

As I type this I am on hold for 28 minutes for a supervisor when I was supposed to get a call back over an hour ago.

This company has made my remodel project and absolute nightmare.

Update ! After promising me they would make this right and the people responsible were "reprimanded" they offered to deliver the door again. Guess what ! They failed to show up AGAIN ! A third time now they have failed to show up after they told me they were delivering my properly constructed Dutch door !  Unreal ! I have disputed my card and will be suing them in small claims court for the costs I have incurred. This company is abysmal !< /Review>

<Review>So my wife and myself went to Eto doors at the hicksville location in Long island to order doors from Eto Corporate in California. Jason the sales rep told us the doors would come and first they would come to his location and will take a day to assemble it then will ship it to us since we are not far from the office... however on 5-31 they were delivered to my house. I left 4 messages for Jason then on Monday 6-6 I called 2 more times and no answer. So I put in a dispute with my credit card company and the first thing the girl tells me when she calls is I will not win the Dispute she didn't even listen to me.... my doors on both sides the jabs are damaged.. I currently do not have doors on my house and Since I am moving back today I had to install them for $1600 plus the $275 to put them together first. Now I am waiting to see if they will resend me the jabs that are damaged after 4 more emails I had to send in a claim on the site... its going to cost me another 1600 to disassemble and re install the damaged parts I would like a call from the company on how they want to work this out...my order number is #50510 and just noticed the doors do not have the weather stripping at the bottom

Update 7-10-2018
Since they never sent me the pieces they promised I am still having issues Doors seem warped bottom adjustable doesn’t close correctly. And during the winter it’s not sealed correctly. I could have bought a better door at Home Depot.< /Review>< Date>

< Review>
What a joke.  I ordered a door ($1200)and waited and waited.   When it never came I called a million times until someone finally answered. BThey told me it would be another 12 weeks "approximately".  Trying to get a refund.< /Review>

< Review>
They just don't care. Esther was difficult to deal with. No education. No common sense.  I asked some questions before ordering a very expensive $3000 door.  She didn't answer any of them, just sent me an invoice. Like I am going order a $3k door without asking questions? I should have read the reviews about the bad owner not caring.<//Review>

BAD SHRIMP. Trice in a row in Pineapple , curry, shrimp. Always great at other Thia restaurants that serve it. This shrimp disintegrates and tastes like dirt.I hope they read and fix it but Im not eating from there again.< /Review>

I am a first quarter transfer student at cal poly from an area known to cook very yummy and authentic types of Asian food and man is this place is amazing. Very authentic food (which is hard to find around here) AND the owners/staff are extremely friendly as well! I got the green curry...🤤</text>

<date>1568585530609<//date><rating>5</rating><review>I really can't say enough about this spot; the menu is consistent and authentic, the service is great and the prices are fair. It's a no-frills, straightforward Thai spot that doesn't even try to cater to any level of hipster or snooty downtown vibe.  They provide an impressive level of spice and heat to their dishes (rated 1 - 4) so consider yourself warned if you think it'll be regular spicy at 3 or 4.
Fresh vegetables and various vegan options, and food is prepared quickly and served hot.</review>< Pictures>

Received raw chicken in curry.
Update: both me and my girlfriend showed signs of food poisoning. Staff was perplexed why raw chicken was an issue. Would not recommend this place. A quick look at their health violations should sway anyone away.</text>

<review>Food was great. The service left a bit to be desired. Once food arrived the waite staff diappeared. Waited forever for bill to be delivered and to get take-out boxes. The real problem was that the restaurant was understaffed. One or two more servers would have helped tremendously.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

As somebody whose worked in the service industry, this place really goes above and beyond in terms of staff service.< /Review>< Pictures>

The lunch special menu has so many choices, and make a great combination with choices of rice, a small salad and a soup. Very nice and a good value too. The service is very prompt and unobtrusive. The staff is so friendly and warm. This is the place for lunch with flavor that takes your mouth on a world tour. Thank You Thai Classic<//Review>

Our favorite weekly lunch date!! Lunch specials, friendly staff who knows us, decor to challenge your sense of color inside and make you want to freshen up their outside patio (pls, just $200 would make such a difference!). But we are loyal and love the food!
As of early July 2020, they did update the patio a little with new tables and chairs, but they no longer offer M-F lunch specials. I sure hope they bring them back. It was a great deal and sure brought in a lot of customers!</Text>

Great Lunch specials. Full Thai menu. Excellent service. Good portions.  Atmosphere: think hole in the wall. Not date night. They could have such a nice restaurant and patio experience.  Outdoor patio could be one of the best in the town. Instead it's more like a garage sale.  Still my favorite Thai in SLO.< /Review>

This has been a family favorite for 18 years! The service is perfect and the food is heavenly. Would definitely recomend the tofu satay and the garlic tofu. Sadly we do not live close anymore but every time we visit we make sure to go here. The owner is also very friendly and sweet. Best Thai resturaunt EVER!<//text>

<Text>Thai Classic is my favorite Thai place in SLO. It is reasonably priced but I have had to wait a little longer than reasonable the last couple times I have gone. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Thai food.</Text></record></dataset><record>

This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant. Well until I sent my 16 yr old into pay and realized they blatantly over charged her. Nearly 60 dollars for two pad Thais and 3 Thai teas. They didn't realize momma was outside waiting. I'm so disgusted, what kind of people take advantage of children like this? What's next ? They should be ashamed.<//text>

The worst customer service I’ve ever seen. I come from Hollywood and that’s not even as bad as this place. These are small town women, I really don’t get it. Only reason I’ve gone to this place more than once was because of the price and their attitude doesn’t affect me when I leave those doors. I’ve tried killing them with kindness and have even humbled myself and not said much, but I’ve seen how they also treat others and they’re terrible human beings. Especially the blonde with the crooked teeth. A bad attitude paired with a bad face makes a terrible combination. If they just had a better attitude this place would get a lot more traffic and they’d even be able to charge more because of it. Only reason they’re still in business is because it’s dirt cheap.</Text>

<review>The hair stylists are AMAZING at what they do!!! There is hardly a wait. At most, their longest wait time is about 5 minutes. (Not even that long!!!) Don't even get me started on the prices. So affordable!!! It’s only $12 for a haircut!!!  I would highly recommend this place!!!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

1 star minus 1star is what I give. They seem to be barber's not beauticians. The girl cutting my hair commented "you get what you get. I had a hole cut into the back of my hair.  I demanded my money back but the manager said she'd  fix it.  Nope, she doesnt know much about cutting womens hair either, just guys.  Terrible attitude.</text>

Completely destroyed my hair permanently. I had extremely healthy lon hair going in. I asked for colored highlights and left with dead hair with bleach that had been left on for hours. I specifically asked for a natural highlight and specifically not to use bleach. I ended up having to chop off my hair and much of it fell out even with all the care i could give it. I can’t believe I let them touch my hair and charge me $95 for it. Don’t waste your time or money<//Text>

<Review>Horrible customer experience from the chick with messed up teeth. Was greatest with joy from serina but once I hit the counter to ask for service the girl sitting there was so rude while I continued to be nice. Used to take my boys to get cuts frequently till today they lost my service because of her. Always heard horrible service but defense was my response until today.< /Review>< pictures>

Well, I have been going there off an on for the past 15 yrs, as well as taking my mother in there and myself the past 3 months. I didn't get a haircut today because I was completely ignored! I sat in there with 2 other people for at least 10 minutes. All three blonde females we're there and heard me come thru the door and sit down. Including that friendly owner Day Spring! Nobody said one word to me! Unbelievable! Another man came thru the door, he was greeted by Day Spring and asked if he wanted a haircut, she then said to him, come on back and he sat in the chair, after that I got up and walked out! I'm still baffled. Did I mention that Day Spring and I used to be on a first name basis? Yes, she knows who I am....Wow!</review>

The Lions Club, and county takes great care of the Park for everyone to enjoy.
They have playground for the little ones, horseshoe pits, baseball fields, soccer fields, tennis court,  picnic areas, plenty of room for a game of tag football. Lots of Big shade trees to rest, read, or play a game of chess.
They have a big Hall you can rent with a full kitchen, and rest rooms for all kinds of parties.
If you walk the street all around it, it's a quarter mile, great for exercising.<//Text>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Nice place for a picnic. NO open restrooms available. NOT a good thing when you've got small children along. We made it work. Luckily there was a softball game going on and the restroom was available there. ( The baseball field sits on the same property just across the field.
Felt safe here. NOT a lot of traffic and the car's driving by watched for children playing.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The restrooms are always closed very disappointed. During the mornings for soccer practice weekdays and weekends or even the big games in the afternoons we have to drive home to use the restrooms. We talked to the city but they just said they should of been opened during those times</Text>

I am disgusted and thoroughly upset with the nasty quality of food I have been getting recently from this location. The food is sloppy, looks terrible, tortillas are hard and taste stale, Mexican pizza was dry tasted rancid, had barely any sauce on it. Skimpiest amout of meat I have ever seen from a taco bell.. especially a new modern one.. terrible, the lack of pride and obvious dont care presentation and quality just permanently put this taco bell on my hell no list, avoid it at all costs. There is sooo much better options right around the corner !</text>

Still SKIMP & COLD...

Prissy employee didn't enter cash given to him (with card for remainder) into register. Charged entire amount to card and then SWORE he put the cash towards transaction. Manager says "in order to verify it we need to count the whole register" which they did and turns out.. HE DIDN'T ENTER IT.
Manager gave two coupons but definitely not worth the bad experience and waiting.
THIS LOCATION SUCKS. NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT</review>

< Review>
I usually come here for the value menu - I'll get the soft potato tacos or cheesy bean n rice burritos. This location always has good food and I want to give a shout out to Cali. Cali is one of the workers there and provides exceptional customer service. She always smiles and asks how you're doing, never messes up your order. You get the same treatment that you would get at a fine dining establishment. Give this girl a raise!</Review>

I don't eat there often at all, but i was out and about yesterday and my son said as we drove by a taco bell that we should have lunch there. Against my better judgment i agreed. Most of the menu items that were my favorites were no longer available and the food i did order was gross. The taco supremes were soo disgusting way too much sour cream and barely any taco meat. Now i usually like sour cream but these tacos were literally swimming in it, my dog wouldn't even eat em and he eats everything even cat poop so i knew then that i will never go back to taco bell again. Just way too many better Mexican food choices available in my area.</Text>< Resp>

Always good and fast. Never mess up an order. Missing a star because the freeze machine has been down, and they never ever give you napkins. Other than that good to go.</text>

<text>DO NOT EAT HERE
This has got to be the worst Taco Bell I've ever been to
The little girl taking orders at this time was rude and mocking me and rolling her eyes at the window. I ordered food for my whole family,, the food was COLD and tasted disgusting.  Not even the nacho fries was warm, DISGUSTING. Sad too because I live around the corner and now I will never eat here again
Teach these youngsters something about customer service and how to respect people.  They have no pride in their work, Bunch of lazy workers!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb1e06669cfc9:0x759f5a7933a5300a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Recommend the cinnamon ball desserts, man they just got the spot after some doritos tacos. Only complaint is the lack of sauce sometimes.</Review>

I had a 5 dollar meal. What can I say, it’s Taco Bell... I was hungry and there it was. A chalupa, 5 layer burrito, chips and cheese, and a drink. Was filling but that’s about it. 🤷‍♂️</text>

<Review>Meh. Not good, but not bad. Drive thru staff is hit and miss. Sometimes friendly, sometimes abrasive, and sometimes outright rude. Personally, I'm not a fan of TB, but my teen kids are. The quality seems to have gone downhill a bit, but at this location, the hot food is always hot and the cold food is always cold. So, they are at least better than most locations in that respect.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I always order my food without lettuce and sauce and they can't seem to listen to the customer when ordering or the cook doesn't pay any attention to the order because they constantly make the food wrong with everything on it. I just received my order not only missing items I paid for but the items I did receive were not made to order this spot is definitely hit or miss and lately they have been missing a lot more. ALSO I tried to call this store right after I saw the food and they can't seem to answer just stays ringing. Go eat somewhere else if you don't want to deal with this type of situation i know I will be.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I cant stand ordering from boxes that you have to yell at to place orders. Ok, so, while I was doing that, this disheveled young female came within about a foot from my cars driver side window in the dark of the night when I had to roll it down to order. I believe she was going to ask for a handout. Im ok with helping those in need. Yet at that hour and at that location without too much light and security I didn't know what next gangsta or street move was gonna happen. She stepped in my space... the managers came out and took care if the problem. Im happy to say, but otherwise, it shouldn't be happening im the first place.<//Text>< Time>

Typical fast food joint. Can't eat here every day or u will get as big as a horse! but the tacos r good & they make this pizza looking thing with a soft/bake flour tortilla on the outside that's fantastic! I typically eat fast food NO more then 4/5 times a month. I'm single so I cook @ home.</Review>

This is probably one of the fastest serving Taco Bell locations I have ever been to. The employees are friendly, they make sure your order is correct and the process of everything is very smooth and desirable.</review>

The absolute worst food today I have had.  Got a party pal of burritos and tacos. Hardly any meat in any of it. Every taco shell was broken . The burritos were barely anything.  Will not be going to the Van Buren store again< /review>

💔 We must be insane to keep going here😤 we keep going back expecting different results 👎 but it was late! So there were limited options. It was like that Chalupa was microwaved into a frisbee. How do you serve that to somebody? I can see the employees don't really about the product they put out or whether or not the customer comes back.. that's fine by me 😊 I'll take my business elsewhere 💸< /text>

Not worth a 🌟. Went into to have a replacement order from the previous weekend that this place totally messed up on. This new order was supposed to be complimentary. Still they tried charging me. As I was checking my order I noticed that it was in fact wrong again. I explained to the cashier what I wanted for the second time. Mind you I had the original receipt. The damn receipt might as well been in a foreign language. They took my order back, and then brought it to me on a tray. After I had just told the front girl it was to go. They took my food back a third time. As I was leaving I noticed that my nachos still was lacking jalapenos. As pleasant as I could possibly be I requested to just put the damn Jalapeno's on the side. Finally got my order said thank you and walked out. On my way out told them I'd never return to this location. All this trouble for an order they messed up on the previous weekend.</Text>

We called their location and no one answered and when they finally answered they hung up on us.... This location is fairly new and now losing credibility so early on. This is infuriating.<//text>< pics>

Love the food, but I keep getting my order incorrect. Got regular tacos instead of potatoes tacos, only getting one steak fries when I order two. IDK I may just start going back to the one on magnolia.</review>

Sty away from this place. This place is very unprofessional have no customer service skills at all. Employees are rude dont want to confirm what u ordered they get upset about it . If I'm going to pay over 30 dollars for what I ordered I would like my order to be confirmed  to make sure it's right  . To the employees I say if u dont like ur job dont work there. Your not obligated to work there let other people that do want to work ... work !  To customers go to the Taco Bell on arlington they have excellent customer service there.!:) Employees are very helpful.<//review>

<Text>They just can not get the order correct. And on 3/13 the mistake sent my child to hospital. I have called and went in numerous times to speak with Gen Manager and always told she is not in or to busy to speak with me. This infuriates me. How can my son's health and safety issue concern that was there mistake be of no importance. Just unacceptable!!! Even after calling and saying I will be reporting the person who answered phone still insisted Gen Manager was to busy to speak with me!<//Text>< gmapID>

<Text>Hit the drive through with my wife and kids. The young girl that took our order was very rude and tried rushing us while we ordered. Once we received our order i told her thank you and she didnt even have the courtesy of saying "your welcome." Then we get home and OMG the amount of meat on our chalupas and tacos was fkn ridiculous🤯😡🤬. Felt like i was eating pure tortilla with lettuce and tomatoes. Never ever going to this location again🖕< /Text><Date>1553044170799< /Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Name>Gerald Gutierrez< /Name></record>

<review>It's a bad location. WALMART ..It's literally in the only left turn. JUMP A LANE. Good luck on business LMAO. It's only entrances are from direct nieghborhood(jelly can't lie lol) or Van Buren Blvd which is congested during typical off n on work hours. It's not the food or service< /review>< pictures>

Today I went it and they were closed. 8:55 pm and both doors were locked. Hours posted states dine in closed at ten. Very irritating when I walk there for my lunch break.< /review>< Pictures>

The employees are welcoming and always have a smile. If they see you looking around, they will ask you if you need help and will jump to help if asked. Great store.< /Review>

<Review>Some workers have become more grouchy twored customers lately. I understand when you have a bad day or situation but please don't take it out on other customers. First money was slapped down and shoved at me the other day and tonight I understand me and my friends where laughing having fun hanging out as we where trying to find fun things to mess around with after perchasing but it was unnecessary to tell us " I know what you're doing " and loudly call for a " security check around the perimiter " as if we where going to steal. And lastly I had a glow stick that I bought that was cracked and did not glow when I bought it. I felt upset allready after asking if I could exchange for the same item and asked " what's wrong with it? " not so kindly even after showing the glow stick dose not glow.</Review>< pics>

I'm always able to find things I need here. And really for the price I have no complaints. Just like anything else you have to do some searching but you can get some quality stuff here<//Review>

<Text>Workers seem fairly new, so it's understandable that their drinks aren't perfect.
Caribbean drink was more sour than expected; it's hard to say it was sweet at all.
I watched them remake the kale specialty three or so times; the drink was chunky with tough parts I had to spit out a bit. The flavor was reminiscent of medication and was very bitter. I was surprised there was fruit when I slurped a solid chunk of banana.
Due to the prior drinks, I found the matcha drink absolutely delicious. Splendid job.

I hope the quality improves in the future.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><time>1529620910529< /time></record>

Had to take a pair of shoes back to change size. The attendant was very professional. He helped me find another pair. I need for a person just learning to walk again and the had to be light and a good walking shoe. I forgot to ask the young man his name. This is a funny....he had nice hands.</text>

< Review>
Google won’t let me rate lower than a one unfortunately! HORRIBLE experience manager Ana Delgado is one of the most unprofessional managers I’ve ever encountered. We went to exchange shoes and unfortunately we had lost the receipt so we were told that we could exchange for other same like shoes OR give us a 30% discount towards other shoes. Manager Ana, was already annoyed ( maybe had a rough day at work) After Ana told us that we could get other shoes at 30% off we decided to get shoes for my daughter. The sales associate said she had to verify with Ana ( manager) to see how to apply the 30% discount. At this point we had already lost an investment of $70 which we were told that was the “only thing she could offer” we got a $24 kids shoes. Ana (Manager) came back to the front with a bad attitude and said that the 30% was only to be applied to the same type of shoes! At this point there was a big line behind us waiting, I was upset but that’s not the best part of this show journey. I asked her for her name paid full price for the kid shoe and left. I called another  Sketchers  Store and spoke to another store manager and guess what? She gave me a whole different story she said that she could’ve applied a store credit because since we didn’t have the receipt she could’ve give us and cash back ( totally understandable) also I told her we didn’t purchase the shoes I was talking about at her store and are you ready for this.........  she said to take them to her , she would do a price check with the store and issue me store credit to ANY shoes!!!!!!!!!!! Ms. Ana Delgado did not go the extra mile as a manager should and this is extremely unacceptable behavior from a store “manager”.  Needless to say we will NOT be going back to this store ever.<//Review>

Some of the shoes she wanted to try on weren't accessible in her size so a team member helped by going to the back to check for her size. She brought us different pairs ,various times. She never hit us with that WHAT EVER IS THERE IS ALL WE HAVE excuse. She was very nice and made our shopping experience better.</Text>< date>

Lots of shoe styles to choose from and different colors.  Hard to make decisions which to choose from. Not expensive.</Review>

<Review>Went there for a pair of sandals.  I got my free popcorn and looked around. Wow the selection is awesome,  as well as the customer service. I wear size 13 a difficult size for a lot of stores I go to, but they told me their shipping date, so I'll be going back soon.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><name>Julio Valle< /name><Text>(Translated by Google) This day I walked in 2 more skechers stores in search of shoes that were soft for a 96-year-old person, when requesting help the different employees told me only what is there we have, we do not have more in this store than what is here , I decided better to go to the store in Plaza México, I was attended by a young man named Jonathan, very friendly and professional when he saw that I could not find what I was looking for, he was making me several suggestions that I should look for in the men's area and indeed there I found the shoes I was looking for , has this young jonathan I congratulate him for his pleasant attention and intelligence in trying to
retain the customer so that they do not leave without buying in your store as they did with me, I recommend them to be satisfied

Este día anduve en 2 tiendas más de skechers en busca de unos zapatos  que fueran suaves para una persona de 96 años, al solicitar ayuda las diferentes empleadas me indicaron solamente lo que esta ahí tenemos,  no tenemos más en esta tienda que lo que esta acá,decidí mejor ir a la tienda  de plaza México, me atendió un joven llamado jonathan  muy amable y profesional  al ver que yo no encontraba lo que buscaba me estuvo haciendo varias sugerencias que buscara en el area de hombres y efectivamente ahi encontré  los zapatos que buscaba,  ha este joven jonathan lo felicito por  su agradable atencion y la inteligencia de tratar de
retener al cliente para que no se vaya sin comprar en su tienda como lo hizo conmigo, los recomiendo quede satisfecho</Text>< Time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) That one at a regular price and the other at a 50% discount, only applies to purchases over $ 25. Buy a pair at $ 75 and the other at $ 24.99. For a penny, I did not get the discount.

Dante is very awesome in taking pictures and videos of my husband's. Really recommend him. My instructor was Tim, he was good and was very careful but I am not satisfied with the videos and photos.  I didn't get so many candid pics.< /Review>< username>

From the office staff to the the tandem jump partner, they made me feel safe and special for my first jump ever. they are well organized and all of them are funny and help ease your nerves if you have any.
I'm recommending this place to everyone i know. they are the best in my opinion.< /Review>

Go jump is super professional and the process from getting on the ground to freefalling was so seamless. They offer so many cool packages like hand cam video and photos, definitely made my first skydive amazing. My instructor was also super friendly and helpful!< /text>

Amazing experience with my group of friends jumping 15,000 feet with ocean views ending with a smooth landing.
The instructors were very vibrant and accommodating.
You can ask them anything before your jump :)
At the end of the jump they gave us a cute little surprise along with a free pen!
Loved it.
Would love to go back again!</text>

The jump was amazing and the instructor with me (Dante) made the experience fun and helped me conquer my fear. I was VERY disappointed to make reservations with all my friends and have our group get split into 2 different planes cause the group before us had people not show up, but after the great experience, this place definitely deserves 5 stars. The lack of any safety videos or pre-jump training was a little unexpected.< /Text>

Went skydiving today for the 1st time for my bday. Booked last minute, literally an hour before my scheduled jump, and they were still able to get me in and match the Groupon price. Gave me a free bday shirt upon arrival which was so cool! I got some free stuff at the other places I went later bcuz I was still wearing the shirt! My instructor was amazing!!! Made me feel safe, secure and at ease. Such an incredible experience! Can’t wait to do it agin, it’s my new bday ritual!!!< /review>

FIRST TIME GOING ON A PLANE, AND FIRST TIME JUMPING! I have an insane fear of heights and flying and I was so nervous before my instructor was DANTE, he was very careful on how to secure me and it's the most insane feeling I've ever felt jumping off a plane! DANTE if you read this you're the MAN God bless you bro!<//review>

<Text>A group of 6 of us jumped together this month. We all had SUCH a great time! GoJump was very well organized and extremely professional. The people we jumped with were all very experienced veterans with thousands of jumps under their belt. We felt completely safe and were free to just focus on the thrill of the jump. Our photos and video came out fabulous and are such great mementos of our epic experience. Everybody was super nice and we can't wait to jump again.

<text>EXTREMELY disappointed!!! READ! READ! READ!
My group of 7 wanted to go celebrate a special birthday skydiving, since I’ve been here before I reccomended GoJump in Oceanside. We all agreed and very excited we all bought our Groupons which includes either photos and video for $199. As I was in charge of planning, I called to make the reservations and they tell me there will be an additional “deposit” of $60 in order to make the reservation. I said I’d have to check with my group so I called back and they gave me a different price for the deposit. I decided to have my friend call, maybe I was misunderstanding, she called and they gave her a different price for the deposit. I did read on the fine print on Groupon that it said,  “$50 refundable deposit required”, in order to reserve. I called and asked the gentleman that answered (David, guy with accent), if the $50 would be refunded when we checked in and he said no, so it’s not a deposit it’s an extra FEE, so I told him I would have to consult with the rest of the group and he offered to call me back in 15-20 min, he never called me back. I call again and another person answered and told me it would be $20 extra per person if we book for 9am instead of 3pm but since they were about to close he told me to call the following day, so I called today to reserve for 9am and now it’s $50 extra for anytime after that $80 extra instead of $50. I have no idea what’s going on, they keep changing the price to make a reservation.
WORST part of it all was this.....
When I called today David answered he gave me a higher price again and I told him he gave me a different price yesterday and told me he would call me back but never did. I asked him if I could please speak to his supervisor and he said very RUDE, “I am the supervisor”, so I went on asking to speak to his manager and again with a rude attitude said, “I am the manager”, so I asked to speak to anyone else but him and he YELLED AT ME, “no you can’t” I was in shock and disgust so I decided to hang up on him. That was extremely rude of him.
HORRIBLE customer service!
And I still don’t have a reservation.<//text>< Name>

Literally the best place to go skydiving ever. Staff inside are awesome, helpful, and fast. Instructors are the BEST and just want each person to have a great experience. The whole process takes about 1-2 hours before you're in gear and jumping but that's honestly no big as long as you're expecting it. GO. DO IT. YOU WILL NOT REGRET :D<//text>

It's a once in a lifetime experience and you'll love it. They even match the Groupon price right there for you. I highly recommend for any adventure seeker.<//text>< pics>

Honestly I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about waiting times and appointments, but we had a great experience. We had our appointment set for a group of 4 on a Friday at 10AM. We did not wait at all, and they got us set up and ready to go super quick. All the instructors are awesome and they made sure the entire group was having a great experience. This is a great place if it is your first time skydiving! Or even if its not still an amazing staff!</text>

<text>I’ve jumped about a dozen times (tandom) here and they have all been amazing. I volunteer for a nonprofit organization Soul Survivor Outdoor that jumps here quite often. Staff is very professional and really makes each jump memorable. Today’s jump was super rad and I definitely got to give a big shout out to instructor Eric. Definitely got radical up there today. So thanks brother.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>I just wanted to say that we just jumped with GoJump. Everything from checking in to suiting up and jumping.  I was very impressed with my jump partner Danny. Super funny, happy, and made me feel really comfortable.  If you haven’t jumped, jump with these guys.  PS the view is incredible if the ocean and the rolling mountains of Camp Pendleton.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great place to jump and beautiful views of the ocean! Had an awesome camera man who made jumping sooo much fun. Had a little problem where my camera mans go cam didn't work so they couldn't recover my video I paid for which was disappointing, but I have to say the owner did a great job in making things right with me and refunded some of my money back! I would definitely jump again here!</Text>

My son Bryan and I made a pact 15 years ago to go jumping. We finally did it and thanks to Jessie and Kate, our experiences were fantastic. Jessie, you are a beautiful Being. Thank you for taking great care and making the flight the most enjoyable I can imagine it could have been. Kate, Bryan sends similar regards. I also have to thank all the other crew members on the ground and in the air. Be Free!<//Review>

<Review>Due to weather conditions my boyfriend & I were unable to jump. I recommend anyone looking to book, book an earlier time. We booked for 4 and unfortunately the clouds got to heavy. Although we were unable to experience skydiving, the owner and staff were extremely professional about the entire situation. The group that jumped before us looked happy, if you’re looking to skydive go here.</Review>< Time>

I jumped for the first time on my birthday with Glenn, who is the best!! He is caring, professional,and thorough, a great asset to the company. (Plus his photo poses are on point) The view is gorgeous...definitely a memorable experience and would recommend anyone to GoJump.
Oh, and a special shout out to Rob due to bad weather on the previous day I couldn't jump with him,but he is amazing and super fun to talk with!< /Review>

You guys are my memories 💙
It was my first skydiving experience and it was incredible!
My instructor Glenn was absolutely professional, he let me felt my self safe(as much as it was possible 😅), so I trusted him!
Also they  have lovely office assistants! Especially blonde lady with a nice shiny make up, she was cheerful !!! Thank You guys.
I'll gonna remember you for whole my life!!!☁️💙☁️< /Text>

<Review>OMG I never imagined I would jump out of a perfectly good airplane, but I did and it was awesome. You need to do it to at least once in your life. The folks at GoJump Oceanside are absolutely amazing, and true professionals. We went there as a group of 30 + people and we were all safe and all happy and all terribly impressed with our jumping partners.< /Review>< user>

<text>What an experience!! The guys at go jump are super professional but fun and light hearted at the same time. At no point was I concerned about my safety or well being. We went as a group of 5, we pre booked online and once we got there it was a smooth check in process. We booked our jump for 2pm and were harnessed and ready to jump within half hour of our jump time. You have the option of paying extra for hand cam footage OR having an extra diver jump with you filming the entire jump for you. ($98 for hand cam & $128 for the extra diver). The jump itself was phenomenal. Seeing the ocean and skyline was absolutely breathtaking!! It was about 5ish mins in total. Be prepared to have a bit of ear pain on the decent, but once your ears pop your good to go!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in going skydiving. You're in good hands at go jump!</text>< Pics>

< Review>
We had such a great time skydiving with GoJump Oceanside!! I went with my mom, brother, and friend who was the only person in our group who had completed a jump before. Our original booking was for a Sunday, however we weren’t able to jump because of the marine layer, which was still thick at 3pm. We rescheduled for 2 days later at 1pm. We arrived at 12:45pm and ended up jumping at 6:00pm. This was because of the same marine layer issue and it being a semi cloudy day. The staff were very friendly and great with keeping us informed and honest with their predictions on if there were going to be jumps that day. We ate lunch and spent most of our time at the humane society next door (and even adopted and took home a cat 🤷🏼‍♀️) after we got the call we were suited up and in the air within 45 min. The plane ride to reach 13,000ft took about 10 min and everyone was out very quickly after that! My instructor, Matt, was knowledgeable, safe, and made sure I was comfortable starting on the ground before we boarded the plane all the way until we were back on the ground after the jump! My mom’s instructor, Rob, was hilarious and a pro with getting great footage not just of her but of our whole group as well. It was an overall great experience and it definitely will not be my last jump!<//Review>

I like to start all my reviews with 5 stars and after the experience I rate and update. I have an appointment for tomorrow at 10am. To celebrate my husband's Armando birthday 🎂 💖 I hope all of the good reviews are true!! And we can enjoy tomorrow. I bought Groupon for $199.00. Paid $50.00 Deposit due back to me after the jump per appointment coordinator. So far so good. I'll leave a yelp review as well 😀 and update that one too.UPDATE:FRIENDLY,FAST,DID NOT WAIT MORE THAN 50 MINS. THEY HAVE A WAITING SECTION. THEY SELL MINI ICECREAMS INSIDE,AND FREE WATER. CLEAN PLACE AND I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO FAMILY & FRIENDS. LOVED IT.</review>

I took my wife here for her birthday. It was the first time for both of us after talking about it for years. Every staff member was friendly and welcoming. The instructors we had were Irish and Adrian. Both were knowledgeable and fun!  They made the experience amazing!  We’ll definitely be back!</Text>

Not sure how all the reviews are positive. Its actually mind boggling.

This was super sketchy.

Felt like I was going to die the entire time.

We had a 10 year old boy giving us our safety briefing.

Not only that but we showed up there and had to pay an additional $300 on top of the $400 we already paid through Groupon.

Even my jumper dude told us how terrible / shady the management is.

Not sure about you but I know I don't want to go to a place where the guy attached to me is telling me the management does everything they can to cut costs, and they cut corners wherever possible.

What a horrible experience this was</Review>

I give this place 1 star because of the owner. He absolutely hustles you. The jump was fun but the guy won't give you a receipt to see why he overcharges you and keeps your deposit. They say 1 price but it is not true the term was called "premium value due to high demand" When you purchase through groupon be prepared to pay way more than if you didn't pay until last minute. I cant believe they are rated so high. It is fun though but not if you are nervous. It could be making up for lost time recently but today now actually yesterday The owner named Mike he is Swiss squeezed every last penny out of my group and wouldn't give us a receipt. I would have left on principal but I wasn't the one paying and we had purchased 199 groupon each. plus the 100 deposit that they kept and more too much to write. BUT the jump was amazing as would it be anywhere I imagine. Anywhere that you dont get hustled that is.</review>

GoJump Oceanside was fantastic.  My son and daughter jumped with me.  This was the first time for all of us.  The tandem pilots were great.   Rob especially made us feel at ease.  The whole operation was organized and professional.  I would definitely recommend.  If you're in doubt, just do it.  Oh yeah, spectacular views.</text>

These guys don't know anything.  I am a C license skydiver with over 350 jumps and was told since I had only made 7 jumps in the past 12 months and not 12 jumps in 12 months that I was not current.  Clearly they don't know the currency requirements in section 5 of USPA SIM that C and D license jumpers need to make at least 1 jump every 180 days to stay current.  Hate to leave bad reviews but skydiving is a community clearly these guys don't want anyone who is not in the "clique" jumping.  If you are looking to travel to DZ's outside of your home DZ stay away from this company.  Rude and does not even know the rules in which they operate under. The uspa probably needs to do an examination of the "qualified" staff working here< /Review>

I had a blast! I'm in California on vacation and I wanted to try tandem skydiving. Everyone was so friendly and trying to hype you up for the experience. It only took around an hour from when I arrived until I was done. Tommy was my tandem guy and he did a great job explaining the whole process to me! Overall it was a great experience!</text>

I had an amazing experience here today! It was my second jump and the staff were super friendly and helpful. My tandem instructor was Kale, and he was amazing! There was a slight mixup between me and someone else who had a very similar name. We had purchased different packages, so I didn't get what I paid for. We were going to ask for a refund of the difference between packages, but the lady went above and beyond and completely made my day. I would definitely jump with these guys again.<//Review>

After having to reschedule due to the rain back in February, we went out on Sunday and showed up at our appointed time of 1 hour 15 mins before. Weather was a little sketchy- rain was gone but there was plenty of clouds. It ended up causing us to wait for 4 hours before flying, but let me tell you, it was absolutely worth it! Our tandem instructors treated us very well and had some nice personal touches to our videos/interviews. J.C. was great! Even the lead manager guy (forgive me I didnt get his name) tried to keep us all well informed about the weather and flight status. Will definitely come back again!<//Review>

I’ve been last day and it was a marvellous flight,
The staff is friendly and professional; they know how to be funny but serious at the same time.
Everything is organized very well.
I enjoyed a lot this trip, no words to say how I felt during the jump and after the opening of the paracadute..
Thanks a lot and I will sure come back, when I’ ll come again in California from Rome Italy.. 🇮🇹 🇺🇸</Text>

Typically have a blast here. I am a repeat tandem diver and the staff is friendly. Have had a couple crummy jumps, but for the most part is a great place. The views are amazing. 100% reccomend. Highly suggest you call the location before booking a jump to make sure there is no maintenance issues and no bad weather predictions.</Text>

<text>For anyone wanting to go skydiving, this is it!  My pilot, Felix, was awesome, took great photos, and was always smiling.

This is toward the end of a long day.  I could easily see the whole crew was tired, but they kept the energy up as much as could be expected.  I give them a thumbs up!

To all the complaints....

This is the beach.  Ocean layer is a thing.  If you book for 10 am, and there are clouds until 11, you EXPECT to wait for 2 more hours.  This is safety, and common sense.  Bring a snack, sack lunch, or go get food.  This is a real thing people.

Again, kudos to Felix.  He handled everything excellently, took great photos, and made the glide and landing comfortable.</text>< pics>

<Text>I had a great experience with GoJump Oceanside last week. My friends and I went for a birthday party as a group of 7.

We used GoJump Oceanside after reading the Google reviews and decided it was perfect for us even though we drove from Los Angeles.

The reservation process online was easy and the staff was friendly and helpful  Accommodating a big group on inexperienced jumpers.

Understandingly with a larger group we had a slight wait but jumping over Oceanside was so beautiful words aren't enough. You gotta try it out for yourself.

I will definitely be back and refer my friends.
My instructor Brad was awesome, fun and knew what he was doing and how to show me all I needed to know to have an amazing experience . Thank You Brad and crew for another great memory.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

We had the worst experience of our lives.

Never again.

This was not our first skydiving experience.
But it was certainly our worst skydiving experience BY FAAAAAR

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

I'm in the hospitality business and GoJump Oceanside is doing everything right. From the heartwarming smiles of the customer reps to the attentive caring instructors, you are set to receive a high quality experience. I couldn't ask for a better skydiving experience. A perfect view of southern California, the beaches, the pacific ocean and later in the evening, the sunset. Absolutely stunning. A must go if you are in Southern California.< /text>

Beware - unprofessional staff, rude and arrogant! I skydived here around mid-Jan 2020 and my tandem skydiver, JC, was extremely rude, arrogant, condescending, and impatient. He made several cocky and snide remarks, and was very impatient at explaining basic procedures to me. When I asked him to repeat something since he was talking too fast, he replied something to the effect of "why don't you look here instead of listening". That is just one account of his misbehaviour. In short, if I were to make an analogy, he was one of those people who looks at you up-down, sizes you up, and then decides on the appropriate tone of voice and demeanor to direct at you.

I actually feel sorry for such people. In their conduct, they reveal how full of anger, fear, and insecurity they are deep down inside. Any individual who is grateful for life and humble would never behave in this manner...

Besides him, even in general, the staff is extremely unprofessional. They're basically young people (not that I have anything against young people. Also, JC mentioned above was much older, by the way) who have not been given training in customer service, how to behave and conduct themselves in front of clients, etc. I heard several of their staff regularly using the F-word and making misogynistic comments. Some of their customers had come there with the families and little children, so I'm sure they would have found such conduct objectionable as well.

After a jump, I also overheard the staff discussing technicalities of skydiving (which apparently were not performed well-enough the last time), which does not inspire confidence among customers who are right there listening to all that.

Finally, I paid extra to have my video edited and in the video they sent me, my voice is not audible and there is background music playing over it...

All in all, a very bad experience. Ruined my whole day. I had to go for dinner in the evening after the skydiving, and didn't even enjoy myself there because of the horrible skydiving experience.

If you're planning to go here, I would advise you to avoid JC as your tandem skydiver at all costs! Or better yet, I would avoid this place altogether...<//review>

First time jumper and can't wait to go again. Megan at the desk (and on the phone) was super helpful. Danny prerigged us and got us pumped for our trip. Chris was my guy and he made sure I had the ride of my life! As my two boys have both already jumped it was only my youngest and I who hadn't checked this off the bucket list but her sister and Mom joined us.  The family that jumps together - has a blast!

You know you want to do it.  GoJump Oceanside is the place to do it.  The view out over the ocean & back over land to the mountains can't be described in words so get over there now and experience it for yourself.  You'll be stoked you did.< /text>

Life changing!. AMAZING EXPERIENCE....My wife and I put this on our list to do 13 years ago and I got this for her birthday. The entire staff was amazing. We did have to reschedule a couple of times  due to the weather but that's mother nature and it's safety first. The staff was amazing and super accommodating. Our skydiver Mikey Max and Ian were awesome. They guide you the entire step of the way. One of the great things i noticed was that the entire staff is like a family and brings the best energy to everyone there.. making a crazy thing like skydiving into an amazing experience. A special thanks to Mikey Max took the time to chat with us and made us comfortable and shared some cool stories. (Thanks brother) Another great shout out and thank you to Emma that was super gracious and so pleasnar ans sweet with rescheduling us and always positive. (Great team members) My wife and I got the pictures and the video and it was so worth it. The jump was amazing and unforgettable however coming home and seeing them after the jump..made it that much more special..we are totally doing it again and not waiting 13 years to do it this time..maybe a few months..😁<//review>

<review>I jumped in Oceanside last May and my instructor Adrian was awesome.
Alas, since Mike Vetter, the owner, terminated most of his seasoned instructors who had thousands of jumps under their belt(or they quit) most of his instructors have been replaced by a few with a couple of hundred jumps under their belt. Scary, when you are jumping out of an aircraft at thirteen thousand feet.
Mr Vetter is also known for employing illegal immigrants, so are you going to trust someone who does that?  Mike's goal is money, NOT your safety.
And if you want a refund on damaged media, forget it!!
They have screwed over lots of people so with all the drop zones in southern Cali, do yourself a favor and jump where the owner follows all safety(and legal) rules! Adrian still rocks! If you want a skydiving company that lies to their customers on a daily basis, then this is the place for you! Cheers! Know this, ALL Mike Vetter cares about is your money, NOT your safety, they keep OS Police Department very busy with instructors landing "off"<//review>< Date>

<Review>Skydiving was the best experience ever!  I came with a small group.  I would have given 5 stars, but it would have been nice if the people up front would direct us where to go after checking in as well as instructions on what to do before jumping or at least during the landing (maybe an instructional video that loops while you're waiting).  You can't really hear that well when you're falling from the sky! 😂 As for my instructor,  he was sweet, except I wished he showed more of the experience in my video-- compared to what my friends had in their videos.</Review><GmapID>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8< /GmapID>< Name>

<text>My name is Lana and I jumped today with gojump oceanside. Shout out to Tommy he's an amazing instructor who made sure I was comfortable, safe, and had a great time, he constantly checked on me, made sure I was okay and was very friendly and professional,

I recommend him for your jump. My experience was unreal, beautiful and breathtaking. DK is an awesome photographer and he'll make sure your pictures and videos will be taken at every moment.

Special thanks to Benny at the desk for assisting me with the photo and video selection I appreciate your superb customer service

What I liked about paying for both the photos and videos options is that you get to select all the pictures and videos that were taken and not just a bunch,

and that's why it's worth it to pay the extra for the entire content. I came here intending to buy only videos and ended up pretty much purchasing the entire picture and video package because of how great it turned out. Additional thanks to the friendly and cooperative ladies at the front desk

I look forward to receiving the content and thanks again for a beautiful experience<//text>< user_name>

<Response>{'time': 1558875973334, 'text': "Hi Ashley,\nFirst off we would like to thank you for wanting to jump with us in the first place. Skydiving is an incredible sport and our goal is to share that with as many people as possible with a safe and incredible experience! Unfortunately, there are a few things that effect the safety of our favorite outdoor sport that are beyond our control- weather is one of them. Transition seasons (spring and fall) can sometimes bring a marine layer that will sit over the water and can move in and sit on top of our airspace making it unsafe to jump. Sometimes it clears up within minutes, sometimes it comes in and out, sometimes it sits there all day. Because the marine layer depends on outside versus water temperatures, they aren't on weather radars as clouds and can be very hard to predict or track. We do our absolute best to keep each of our customers informed as soon as we make decisions based on weather. Sometimes we nail it but other times the weather does something we didn't predict. Unfortunately those days you picked to jump, the weather wasn't operational. We do our best to let you guys know as soon as we know what's going on but sometimes we don't predict fast enough and I extend our apologizes for that. We know it can be frustrating to have your hopes set on jumping, make plans and organize travel to have weather stand in your way. We promise that if we could control it, it would be sunny all day long! :) On your rescheduled day we pushed your time back because the clouds were in and out all day and we landed a few airplanes without even dropping the jumpers. At a certain point, the clouds came back in and never went back out and that's when we inform all the customers. We apologize for the frustration and hope you guys are able to pick a beautiful sunny day to visit us and have the experience of a lifetime!"}</Response><Review>We travel 3 hours for this experience and paid for a hotel over night to make the skydiving an event. The company canceled on us 1 hour before our jump. We rescheduled, they cancel 48 hours ahead, which was a bummer but better. We rescheduled, travel into town again, they schedule us for 3pm, push back our time throughout the day and then cancel us at 4:30 when they promised is a 5PM jump. Unprofessional and disrespectful.< /Review><rating>1<//rating>< user_name>

What an experience!! They're all very nice and helpful. I felt completely comfortable and safe with my jump guy. One thing that I hadn't expected was the pain in my ears during the free fall due to the change in altitude. It stopped once the chute opened and our descent slowed. I would still jump again but would see if there was a way to stop the pain.< /Review>

< review>
Jumped on my birthday and it was an amazing experience.  The crew was friendly and really hyped you up for the jump.  They took very meticulous care and attention to safety and made sure we were ready and prepared for the jump.

You don't get the ocean view too often for a skydive and it was all worth the price of the jump alone.

All in all I'd definitely come back for another jump.< /review>

<rate>4</rate><text>Very good experience, my wife and I had a blast skydiving for the first time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when we got there to jump, everything was extremely rushed, including the safety briefing. Literally all they told us is “hold onto your straps and act like a banana when we jump.” I suppose it is as simple as that, the tandem instructor does all of the work...but there was still a lot that wasn’t explained.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8< /GmapID></record>

<Review>From someone who is afraid of heights and doesn't like rollercoasters, let me just tell you, it was an amazing experience! A must for sure! The views on this beautiful day were breathtaking! Seeing the snow called mountains and seconds later seeing the beautiful ocean from that vantage point was just a magical experience. I can see why people can get addicted why the instructors love skydiving. Definitely worth getting every video and picture, especially if you think you'll only do it once. Can't wait to see my photos and videos!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

This is my second trip with them and it has been great. The team is excited and helpful. They want you to have a great time. Plan on waiting at least 2 hrs past your check in time to actually get up in the air. Bring a snack and a book. It gets kinda boring.< /text>

I’ve been jumping at this drop zone for years. The family atmosphere and the people are my favorite thing about this place! Mike Vetter truly cares about all of us and I’m happy to bring my business to GoJump Oceanside and send anyone I know to this fabulous establishment. Come check it out! Whether you’re interested in your first tandem jump or fun jumping your face off this is the place in SoCal!< /text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>BEST EXPERIENCE EVER! BUt that is because I was Skydiving which is fun irrespective.

GoJump Oceanside usually cramps up 10 pairs of people for tandem jumping into a small aircraft. So, it got hard for me to breath while the plan was taking off and during the flight. I was able to catch my breath comfortably only when I was ready to jump.

This is something to look into. Other than that, they have been pretty awesome.< /review>< Date>

<review>I love this location for sky diving as you get to see the ocean and it's even fun to see the fwy as you come in for a landing.  While I didn't get to jump the second time I was here, it  was nice to see that the planes were bigger since the last time I jumped.  Great crew that knew what they were doing.<//review>< date>

Our first dive and absolutely loved it! Yes they did delay our scheduled time because it was very cloudy and we actually appreciate that cause Even though our jump was 2 hrs later, it was a clear sky and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Loved the staff and their attitude. Can't wait to dive again!<//Review>

<Date>1534648831898<//Date><review>Less than one star would be better. Horrible customer service. Overbooked day but attributed to weather. Yes, morning was overcast and schedule pushed back but knowing that,  and knowing plane capacity and time per trip, why continue to book customers throughout the day,   knowing it would leave customers left out? Our group was scheduled for 12pm but that was pushed back to 3pm. Customers were not notified until arrival and are continually told another hour... another hour... another hour.... at 7PM, still no announcement when i  had to ask if another plane was going up and was told no. And no announcement was made. First the reason was that the pilot wasn't going up again, that changed to FAA regulations. So half the group did not get to go,  although later customers in small groups were taken ahahead of us. Shame on GoJump!< /review><UserId.>104941919625195933611</UserId.>< username>

Three words to describe GoJump: Careless, thoughtless and incompetent. Not a great combination for a sky diving business.

Similar to others' experience, their operation is poorly run with no customer service: they basically could give two flying you-know-what about the customer. I'll give it to them that they did so with a smile.

We booked a reservation, left work early, drove two hours from OC and arrived 15 minutes before our schedule appointment. When we arrived, they told us that the wait was 2.5 hours. They have our email and phone number and it didn't occur to them to let us know. The fog kept rolling in and they still encouraged patrons to "wait and see another 30 minutes", it was dusk by then and they had two more planes to go up.  I figure if this is a well established, expert shop, they would at least understand weather trends and let their appointments know that the jumps have been pushed back and begin your reschedule people. We understood weather is unpredictable and safety is the number one priority. But that does not give a business the excuse to operate in a fashion where they clearly do not care about the customer or their time. Needless to say, they called the day and we never went up. We wasted 5 hours and a half of tank of gas (plus tolls).< /review>

<review>Was there last weekend 07/22/2017.  The jump was amazing , my instructor Joe was great and I felt very safe with him, I felt he made efforts to made me feel comfortable.
We had to great like one hour but not big deal. I hope they fix the 'managment' issues the seem to have because other than that the place and location is great< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Its very rare when I do this, but this experience had to shared. It was a friend's bday and he decided to go skydiving. We went with a group of 5, it was amazing!!!!!!! INCREDIBLY AMAZING DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. My instructor or the guy strap to me that made sure I didn't die, his name was John, incredible person beautiful spirit had jokes so I was calm through everything. It was just a beautiful experience. Recommending Go Jump to everyone I know and also showing off my video its an experience they will not forget. Now I can tell my husband "yes babe angels do fall from the sky 😉" he did it too fyi he loved it he was terrified it haunted him for about a month but he did it I'm so proud of him ☺<//review>

< Review>
Went skydiving for the first time with my wife and friends yesterday, had an awesome experience with my instructor Braden and videographer Paul. The whole jump staff made it a fun, loose, and relaxing environment. The actual jump is exhilarating yet peaceful. Highly recommended, will do this again.< /Review>

<date>1556413478792</date><text>Do not skydive here!!! They will waste your time.

I flew in from Denver to skydive at Gojump.
We checked in at around noon and were told to come back at  1:45 ( even though we had an aapt). After coming back we waited for 2.5 hours only to be told at 5pm that due to the weather they would not be flying anymore- Although they close at 5 so I question if it was really the weather or just the fact that they were done for the day.
Since I flew in from Denver for this, I asked if they could give me a special deal or some type of offer for the time wasted (5 hours) and they said there was nothing they could do for me. I asked to speak to the owner (Mike) and was told that he was not there but it was a lie he was behind the counter.
I understand weather changes happen but I did not appreciate the fact that they did not appreciate me as a customer or the time I wasted.
DO NOT SKYDIVE here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The they will waste your time!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//text>< rate>

The EPIC thing I never ever did before! Thanks to my instructor Ian, very nice and patient , help me to finish this challenge. Since it was sunny, we didn't encounter any delay. It took 1 hour and 15 minutes from preparation to landing. I will definitely recommend my friends to come here and at that time I will come back again!  Peace< /Review>

Skydiving crew is amazing, but I would never pay a penny to this establishment. It's all about the almighty dollar, which is not what you want when your life is in someone's hands. I at least expected professionalism. We sat for 4 1/2 hours, being strung along, with staff telling us to check back every 30 minutes, and yet we never got to jump. The owner was at the desk, and didn't even apologize. He was arrogant and rude. Go somewhere else to jump.<//Text>

<Text>All the staff were stellar, from booking, to flying, and after service. Did the right thing to book my first jump with this company. Arrived there at 10:40, got in plane at exactly 11:00, flight for 15-20mins then jump. Best adventure ever, not even a pinch of pain, no relapse or whatnot, just hangover with euphoria haha. Everything was phenomenal! Maxim was a rockstar on air, he made it blissful and extremely fun, his directions were all clear. Luke was very warm, he made me feel like we’ve known each other for a very long time and I love it. He gave the best outside shots I could ever hope for. Check out my IG video: annedexionary

Will definitely jump again with them both and will even be prepared for 50% tip next time. Those awesome men deserve it.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80dc702e7962ca9d:0xceed590d529b63a8< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing experience,  just be prepared to wait a long time for your turn. We had a 3pm reservation,  but had to wait 2 hours before we actually jumped. That wait was with NO weather,  or mechanical delays. Kind of a let down considering I had to cancel plans later in the day to accommodate the wait. Overall, the jump was worth the wait.  My jump instructor was very nice and I felt safe jumping with him. Make sure to get pictures and video because it goes by so fast,  you'll want something to look back at and remember.< /Text>

Service is hit and miss, some are extremely friendly and do there best to make sure you have the ultimate experience, others don't care whether you live or die and treat you like you don't exist... Unless you are getting a very good rate, I'd look elsewhere.  If it hadn't been for the two people that really did put effort into their job (the two guys that I actually jumped with) I'd give this place a lower rating.  Thanks to them my experience was salvaged, I almost cancelled the jump.  You'd think a place that holds your life in their hands would take better care of their customers.  The name of the game here is get your money, not love of the game.</text>

<date>1558194203921</date><Text>This was flippin amazing! ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY!!! All of the GoJump employees are down to earth, knowledgeable, & energetic (with the exception of the front desk ladies who seemed hella stoned and mis informed us on basic information) but Tommy (my guide) was a step above the rest, simply put, hes amazing. He was respectful and kind, always made sure to check in and make sure I was feeling right, as I'd imagine adventures such as these can be overwhelming to some. On the way up he took the time to scream over the plane engine and point out different sights around San Diego such as the La Jolla coves, Catalina island, Coronado, etc. He verbally walked me through each step along the way so I was prepared and not caught off guard, which in turn made me feel safe. My friend did not get the same experience with her guide which makes me all the more confident when I tell you to ASK TO JUMP WITH TOMMY. Sky diving at GoJump is absolutely worth the time & money. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and having a guide such as Tommy made the experience unforgettable from beginning to end. I gave 5 stars despite the misinformed stoney twins at the front desk cause the prep, the ride, the jump and the guide (TOMMY) made up for the 5 mins of confusion. Keep doing what you're doing guys 🤙Aloha</Text></record></dataset><record>

Jumped on a beautiful sunny day at Gojump in Oceanside today. We had to wait about an hour and 45 to have the sky clear up but overall the experience was great. The instructors were friendly, helpful, and engaging. Jesse is a great instructor and I felt like my life was in good hands, lol. Definitely a memorable experience and would recommend anyone to GoJump.</review>

<Text>Bad business! We had reservations to jump at 5 p.m. today. You called and canceled due to weather. We were already on our way to Oceanside when you called. It turned out to be a beautiful day, sun is shining and the sky is almost clear. Come to find out, you guys are still operating taking the earlier reservations in our place. That doesn't seem right. The earlier reservations should be rescheduled and we should be able to keep our reservations. We have two people that had to build up the nerves to do this and two people who traveled from Colorado to have the ocean view experience. Very disappointing!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Also freezing temperature. You should be allowed to cover ears somehow. My one lobe was swollen for hours. Also my tandem mate never warned me about difficulty breathing; other instructors told their flyers to scream first 10-15 seconds to get used to thin oxygen and breathing. I struggled first 15 seconds without any verbal aide. I think my guy is just over taking people up.<//Review><response>None<//response>< pics>

<Name>Neil Rios<//Name><response>None</response><Text>I pre paid for my partner and I to go skydiving, we repeatedly had to cancel due to delays related to weather. My partner & I decided that we would like to be refunded, & we're assured that we would be.  Since then, I was refunded my initial deposit. After that, I reached back out to the business to request my full refund (I am still owed $298).

The owner mike (who has been extremely unresponsive) initially said that he tried to refund my card but was unable to get the refund to process successfully.  After waiting for quite some time, I told mike that I would be filing a complaint if I was not refunded. He then assured me that he would be sending a check out. I waited again, didn't receive anything, reached back out to mike & have not heard back. I also emailed the business to request the business license number 3 weeks ago and have not heard back.

I've been trying to handle this matter since September 24 2017 (almost 1 year). My experience with mike & go jump oceanside has  been extremely negative. I am very concerned about their business practices & feel that they have handled this process very irresponsibly.< /Text><rate>1</rate>< pics>

All safety measures and precautions are taken, so there is no complaint about that from me. I appreciate that they don't take risks with safety. However, as many of the other reviews have mentioned, GoJump does not value the customer's time. They canceled our first appointment without notifying us, and we only found out after making the long drive down to the area. We rescheduled twice after that, and they were extremely inflexible about times. We had booked our first reservation about a month in advance, so they should have been more accommodating with their times.

The third reservation we booked was at 5 pm.  Remember, the time is booked with the assumption that you're actually going to be getting on the plane pretty soon after that time. We called at 3 to confirm that they were still on, and all seemed well. We arrived at 4:45 pm to be told that there was a 2 hour delay. We waited for an hour and 20 minutes, and then they canceled the rest of the jumps due to weather. There was no compensation for our wait, drive, or the inconvenience of constantly rescheduling.

Again, I'm glad that they don't try to force jumps in bad weather conditions, but this inefficient scheduling is ridiculous. I can't imagine trying to do this on a vacation with limited time. If you're really set on using this company, I'd suggest to book your reservation in the middle of the day and then plan to make it a full-day commitment.

When we finally did get to jump, it was truly an amazing experience. The tandem pilots are great and seem really focused on making sure you're comfortable.

In all, I think the office should be more organized and helpful. I think the best way to ensure your jump the first time is to schedule it for late morning or early afternoon. Thank you.<//Text>

I purchased tickets through a third party and they confirmed with me that day that the jump was still on. I arrived at GO JUMP and they informed me all jumps had been cancelled. I requested my money refunded and instead of giving me the run around. They not only contacted the third party but wrote and signed a document stating that I be refunded, due to no fault of my own. I recieved an email that same day from the third party stating that my money was being refunded. These are good people</Text>

I thought it was crazy. The plane turned around to chop us up while we flew through the air, and the skydiving guide pulled out a gun shooting the plane down. Crazy Cool!!!!

I highly recommend jumping to everyone.<//review>

If it is your first time going skydiving and you would like to tandem skydive, I would recommend buying your ticket on Groupon. It is much cheaper. They are very nice people. It is usually somewhat crowded but the wait to go up is 30 minutes or less. The planes are always taking off to drop a new load of sky divers. They fully answer any questions you have and have great package deals for those who love skydiving. The area is calm. However, parking isn't that great. They also sell food outside while you wait. If you just want to watch, they have an area outside to watch.
Now when you go on the plane, they take you over the ocean. The instructors have GoPros to record every moment.
Appointments are required to secure your spot. They will cancel and reschedule due to weather. Make sure you check the weather if you don't wish to get an email or a call about them having to reschedule due to the weather.<//Text>

Can’t wait to go back! Thanx again for the generous offer, I will see you soon!

First time skydiving long story short...waited over 2 hours after being told 30 minutes...worst part 3 days after I finally called to see what happened with my pictures and video...to come to find out they lost it....?
You can't take back a first time experience like this....want to see if they makeup for it.

<Text>BE AWARE: Even if you make an appointment online and come 15 minutes your scheduled appointment, YOUR STILL GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT 1 to 2 HOURS BEFORE GOING. When you come in you sign a waiver and ypu head to the desk to check ID and pay, not once did they ever ask you what time is your appointment. You could have been just driving by and you wanted to go sky diving so you come here, meanwhile there is someone who booked their jump at the same time, if they get there before you then too bad they go first. This is something that has to get fixed right away. When you schedule a reservation for a jump at a time you should be jumping at that time not 2-3 hours afterwards.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I just went yesterday.Was my first Tandem Jump! I am scared of heights and extreme rollercoasts but since my dad passing due to cancer it made me realize life is too short! This was part of my bucket list I am thankful to Go Jump and a special thanks to My instructor Paul for making it fun and an epic experience for me! You must at least do it once! YOLO!❤<//Review>

The wait is way too long. Employees lie and say the wait is one hour. We waited 3 hours before going to the desk and asking what was going on. We were told we’d go up in 15 minutes. She lied. We waited another hour and a half.< /Text>

My appointment was supposed to be at 2pm
I arrive at the town at 1pm then they call me and tell me it's been pushed to 5pm. Then I wait till 5 and I get there. Then they tell me they are not flying at all today because their ONLY plane is broken....

I drove 6 hours to get here and wasted another 3 hours in the empty town thanks to this place.

They did not provide any compensation other than a "sorry"</Text>< Pics>

<review>Very bad customer service. Never return calls, never respond on emails. Reschedule 3 times tandem jump over 3 weeks period. Last time without notice and I call a hour ahead and they confirm it will be jump as booked by schedule.
Not recommended. If you want spend a lot of your time for nothing go to GoJump.
Beside that Groupon NON REFUNDABLE but representative told me it is.
Unsatisfying and bad experience.<//review>< name>

<review>It's a once in a lifetime experience. The skydive itself was incredible. But I'm only giving GoJump three stars because we have waited for almost half a day despite booking beforehand. We've booked a dive at 12 noon but we did not jump until 5 pm. We arrived at the place 15 to 12 and we were told that there's a lot of people jumping that day so we should go back at 2 pm. So we had some snacks first and went to the beach and came back but was told to wait another 45 minutes... and another 40 minutes... then finally we were called but we waited for the helicopter for some more minutes. But dive was so worth it that I forgot all the complaining I did for three hours.</review>< Pictures>

Why is there even an option to make an appointment?

We made our appointment for 2PM, showed up 20 minutes prior to be told it would be about an hour wait. At 3PM, we inquired about an update and was told it would be another 25 minutes or so. Finally, at 4PM, the staff said that it did not look like we would even be able to go up in the air. We were offered a refund but this was after driving an hour to get there, two hours twiddling our thumbs in a tent outside, and now another hour drive back to our hotel. A refund is not going to give me back a full day wasted on my vacation. Very disappointed.< /review>

Such nice people. We went on June 23 @ 10:00. Unfortunately we had June gloom. It wasn't expected to burn off until 2ish. We could have waited but decided to reschedule for another time. There has to be clear skies over the jump zone. I went with a Groupon and was concerned that it would be a problem. It's not. We will reschedule for sometime in July so my nephew can go for his 18th birthday. We did not have to pick a date right then. .....BTW. we're glad we did not wait. It ended up not burning off till late afternoon.< /Text>

Felt a little skeptical about this place because of the mixed reviews. But besides that the place was really good. Front desk didnt give me any issues about my Groupon, they even let me jump 30 minutes before my actual scheduled time. The dive itself was amazing and totally worth the drive and money for that view. Instructors were very nice and enthusiastic. Would defiantly go again. I went on a Friday and only had one plane ahead of me so I was done within an hour.</Text>

Worst customer service... I'm still shocked. Specifically speaking, the manager, think his name is Mike, is the worst.

We drove 3 hours from LA and waited for 3 hours. At 6 pm, we were told that we couldn't jump due to the weather. Which is fine, but when we asked the manager (very nicely) is it possible to give us an incentive to come back (a video or something), he was so condiscending and keep saying "I don't understand why would I do that".
He made it a very easy decision to get a refund.

If you go, hope you get to jump (booking earlier in the day if possible), because dealing with the manager would not be pleasant.<//Text>

It sad that companies like this are not avaliable to give their services.
In first place they send me to breakfast for the cloudy day, it's OK, I understand that but after that they told me that my family and I have to wait cause the don't have a good plane, ok again, I wait 3 hours just to they told me that it doesn't work so they can't do anything.
They not offer a discount, anything.
Hope that they can fix this.< /Text>

Disgusting experience with go jump. Wasted a whole day of my vacation... Drive so many hours to get there for them to tell us the jump is cancelled after delaying it without even calling us and notifying. The staff is lacking experience. The owner has zero business experience and seems to have the mindset that the customer can be wrong.</Text>

<text>The actual jump was amazing but the people behind the desk were extremely rude. I booked my jump through Groupon and thought i was purchasing the jump for $50,but the wording was deceiving. I also bought the video & pic package but felt I was missing some shots. I called and the girls who picked up were extremely rude and kept passing the phone to a different person because they didn't want to deal with me. The first time I called the girl said they were too busy to explain my concern over the phone and would have someone call me back and explain it. She didn't ask me for my number or name. I called a second time and the girl who picked up passed the phone to a different girl because she didn't want to deal with my concern. Don't get me wrong, i had an amazing experience, but they need to replace the people who handle their phone calls.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
My wife and I were extremely shocked at the customer service here. We work extremely hard all year for our annual vacation and this place ruined a big part of it. The blonde chick at the desk was being extremely rude. They did not send out an email or call for cancelling our jump and tells us to talk to the manager I think his name was MIke? Or Michael. Mike is probably the worse business owner I've ever encountered. Yelled at my wife and I for complaining about driving 8 hours down to Southern California without getting a call for the jump being cancelled. Mike tells me he only has one plane and The propeller fell off today ???!! Please take my word and book with a bigger company that has more reliable/safer planes and more importantly  a decent customer service< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Oh my Tandem pilot was amazing!!!! He was very freindly, supernice. He was very helpful to get me on this as this was my first jump, he made it so comfy.
Great place to jump as the view was worth million.
They take jumps very seriously for the safety of people. Our jump was delayed for almost and hour due to dark clouds... but once they passed oh we geared up for one the most adventurous thing.
My ODV Anmark was brilliant as well, she took great shots and videos of me with a great view.
Later one the video I saw doing crazy stuffs on cam which made my video so cool.
Will be a great memory.
My jump was excellent...... I m definitely coming back again... and recommend others as well.

<text>Some friends and I made a reservation for a sunset jump (4pm), and drove out from las vegas to do it.  We left Vegas at 7 am, ready to go and with plenty of time to arrive, book our hotel, and head to skydive.  We got a text at 1 pm that day saying that our dive was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.  We called, and were told that weather had pushed the timetable back, and if we wanted to come down they would try to fit us in, but no guarantees.

We decided to try our luck, and drove down...

We arrived at the office, and asked to speak to someone about whether we would be able to fly or not, they directed us to the manager who told us that at 8 am it had gotten very cloudy, and no one was able to jump for 3 hours.  As such the timetable had been pushed back, and sadly there was no time for us to jump today.  I explained we had driven all the way out from Las Vegas to jump with them, and he told us he understood that but there was nothing he could do, he offered to reschedule us for another day, but as they were full both Saturday and Sunday he was unwilling to schedule us for then.

The reasons for the low review score are these.

1.  The company did not call/text us when inclement weather occured to let us know we might be delayed.  Nor did they let us know after it was clear we WOULD be canceled (at 11 am)  They waited until 1pm to let us know.  I completely understand if things get canceled because of weather and am in no way holding them responsible for the weather.

2.  The company was unwilling to work with us in any way shape or form after bumping us from our times.  A reservation is a reservation, if someone has one for a specific time it holds no less value than someone from an earlier time.  If they are going to bump people who are later in favor of those who are earlier then it makes no sense whatsoever to EVER book later with these people.

3.  The company was perfectly willing to cancel later reservations, yet was unwilling to push anyone from other days in order to make things right with those who were canceled in prior days.

4.  While the manager displayed a calm demeanor, the receptionists don't.  They are rude, and unpleasant.

5.  If you say "I would like to make this right for you"  then do nothing whatsoever to "make this right for you"  then it is a lie.  Don't lie to potential customers.

We booked with Lake Elsinore skydiving the next day and had an awesome time.  its a little bit more spendy, but the customer service was good, and it actually felt like they cared.<//text>< pics>

Made a reservatuon and still had to wait 2 HOURS TO GO.... This is unfair and the management is terrible for allowing this. Very unfair to those who have planned out there entire day to be told that they still have to wait a LONG time even though they had a reservation. Reading all these reviews alot of people have this same problem... time for management to make some adjustments. UNBELIEVABLE.<//Text>

< review>
GoJumpOceanside. The only complaint I have was that we had an appointment on Sunday at 12pm and we didn't jump till right before 5pm. When we arrived and checked in they said they hadn't jumped anyone all morning due to weather(sky's weren't clear enough over head) and said we had a 2hr wait , they started to send planes up but they had all the morning appointment to get through and catch up on, so we left and went to go eat, came back at 2pm and still had more of wait and they were stoping again because clouds were coming back.But to be honest after being there you could say that they should call you and let you know what's happening if delayed and your appointment is in the PM but in reality they only had 2office staff their that day and that's a lot of people to call and no one can detect the what the weather is going to do. And to be honest I'd rather wait all day or reschedule if their major concern is the safety of everyone going into the sky , so for me I'd rather be delayed hours if it means it's the best safety precautions they can do by delaying and making sure the weather is in good condition to sky dive . But anyways it Was a great experience! , the skydive was nothing like I thought it would be! IT WAS AWESOME! -and my sky dive Professional Thomas made it awesome! The only complaint is the delayed hours but after going through it , it was completely understandable weather safety is serious and I'd rather have that then a business that doesn't care about that, and Go Jump Oceanside is by the beach so you have to realize that , that kind of weather is a common thing their so delays are highly possible. And since we were delayed about 4.5 hrs when we jumped it was sunset time so that was even better . So my advice is if your going their plan an appointment around from morning time to 1pm and for sure you probably will jump that day even with delays ,. And plan it to be an all day thing or half day event , don't just plan on coming in at your time and being out in an hour but other than that it was a AWESOME EXPERIENCE and I would do it again</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Be careful if purchasing jumps on Groupon. I bought a groupon for one jump at GoJump Oceanside so that I could join my friends on the date they had already reserved. However when I tried to redeem the groupon GoJump told me my groupon was not valid for the day my friends were jumping, that it was only worth $50 towards a jump on that date (I paid $179 on Groupon), and that I'd have to wait a month to redeem my groupon without paying extra. Groupon was a complete pain to get a refund from as well.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Very bad communication. I had several doubts regarding a jump to give away, and only once did they answer the call and an email, then I could not communicate again, since they do not answer the phones or they did not respond to the EMAIL.
The web page is not clear, the only time they answered me the information was different (cost and about the video of the jump) with what appears on the web ..
Therefore I could not or rather, decided not to buy due to mistrust.

Muy mala comunicacion. Tenia varias dudas respecto a un salto para regalar, y solo una vez me constestaron la llamada y un email, luego no pude volver a comunicarme, ya que no atienden los telefonos ni me respondieron el EMAIL.
La pagima web no es clara, la unica vez que me atendieron la informacion era diferente (costo y sobre el video del salto) con lo que figura en la web..
Por ende no pude o mejor dicho, decidi no comprar por desconfianza.

(Translated by Google) It's cold going up. Wear it warmly ... and it's a bit dizzy when you're spinning. Tell the Instructor not to spin, not a photo, but I did an outside video and this is better. It's a waste of money for wrist videos and other photos.

올라 가면 추워요. 따뜻하게 입으시길...그리고 빙빙 도는데 좀 어지럽습니다. 인스트렉터 한테 스핀 하지 마라고 하세요.사진 말고 전 아웃 사이드 비디오 햇는데 이게 젤 나아요. 손목 비디오나 다른 사진은 돈 아까워유..비싸도 아웃 사이드 비디오 추천< /text>

(Translated by Google) I made a reservation with the most expensive package and paid for the total price. I asked for an extra deposit for the amount of the deposit.
