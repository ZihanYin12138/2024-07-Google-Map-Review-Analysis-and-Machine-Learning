<review>My friend who is vegan introduced me to double zero. I'm not vegan but WOW. Best pizza and pasta I have ever had. And I'm from the east coast. The whole vibe is mellow and great for date night or a chill hang with friends. I pretty much eat here at least twice a week now. 🔥</review>< pictures>

Originally, I visited the location in NYC. When I planned my trip to LA, I knew if have to come to the Double Zero location there, too.

The food and drinks were just as amazing as I remembered, but I prefer the environment and atmosphere in NYC...LA feels too casual whereas NYC felt more upscale. The staff was great, though! Maybe the atmosphere will change once I can dine inside again.<//Text>

This was a good vegan restaurant. Staff is super accommodating and very kind. The food was good—and all homemade. My only complaint is that the GF pizza crust isn't the best. However the toppings and cheese are very tasty.<//Text>

I’ve been craving vegan pizza since landing in California... so happy Double Zero is on both coasts!! The outdoor dining setup is on the street so there is a bit of car traffic, but still makes for a pleasant experience. We had the pepperoni pizza, truffle pizza, pasta bolognese, caesar salad, and fried artichoke. Don’t get the truffle pizza unless you’re a fan of mushrooms.</text>

We had the truffle and pepperoni - both lacked flavor. The basil on the pepperoni was great and the mushrooms on the truffle pizza were nice texturally. Overall though, the pizzas were bland and pretty disappointing. Would recommend the sister restaurant Sestina for better pizza. Not sure if we just had an off day as I remember the NYC location being delicious, but probably won’t return here.</review><Rate>2</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is literally my boyfriend & I’s favorite place! We are here once a week and never disappointed. Coincidentally, Doug is always our server & we wouldn’t have it any other way. He is friendly, attentive, and basically has our order memorized by heart. There is seriously no better pizza in LA County, the crust CANNOT be beat. Shout out to Courtney & Jonathan as well who are also amazing. Basically, the entire staff is wonderful and we are so grateful for Double Zero, especially the little one currently cooking in my belly who cannot get enough of this delicious food.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Fantastic pizzas and none of that heavy bloaty feeling after porking out like pizza usually makes me feel. Their crust is amazing - really thin and hearty. Ingredients are top quality and the people running the place were very cool, friendly and knowledgeable. Another awesome MK plant-based hit I'd say and my current favorite pizza in LA.</text>< pictures>

I like meat on pizza however this place made me rethink what I know about pizza and blew my mind with their truffle pizza. The meatball calzone is also amazing as is the pepperoni. Well done man-bun man, well done.<//text>

Double Zero refers to the semolina flour used in making traditional italian style pizza dough.  I have frequented a few other restaurants who utilize this amazing flour to make their dough and in comparison Double Zero's methods are top-notch.  Their margherita pizza was absolutely perfect.  The restaurant is entirely vegan and among the best I've been to in the LA area<//text>

Vegan spots are really on the up and up and Double Zero gleams a shiny gold star from this meat eater! I don't seek out vegan food but I'll happily stumble into one and give it a try! I came by for the Sunflower Caesar and loved the crunch of the homemade croutons! Perfect pairing with a glass of wine and super gorgeous interior to spend an afternoon sipping and people watching! I'll definitely be back for one of those pizza pies- can't wait!< /text>

<review>6/5 waiter Grant, was hilarious and easy on the eyes. Ten out of ten would recommend to a friend.
Tap water excellent.
Caesar salad great.
Pizza was ok.
Table was angled poorly. Could not easily facilitate the eating of the pizza.<//review>< user_name>

<Review>Place is amazing. Been quite a few times and love it still. I've done my tour of vegan sushi across the US (NYC, Bay Area, LA, etc).  This one ties for 1st place in my experience.< /Review>< pictures>

The best plant-based food in Venice!!! The chopped salad is sublime, as are their pizzas, pastas and desserts. Highly recommended.</text>

I love double zero, so I am biased. Having been a patron at their NY, RI, and CA locations, let me say this: the team in Venice are absolutely stellar. The food is incredible, so I won't even go on and on about the truffle pizza or tiramisu... But amid this pandemic, the team (and one young lady in particular) in Venice were above and beyond gracious and hospitable and all of the things you would hope for in a service team. I watched aggressive takeout customers get rude with her, and she continued to be polite and courteous. It was a bit of a testimony for how humans should treat one another. All of the staff couldn't be nicer, but to do so in the wake of cranky customers demanding food and demanding it immediately, they delivered deliciousness and manners. Kudos to whoever staffed this location!< /Text>

<Text>The ambiance is great for a date. Dark, pretty romantic. The menu reads great as well, very uniquely vegan. However, the food that came out was slightly underwhelming.

I've never had this kind of vegan food before, particularly with the dairy substitutes for cream and cheese, and they were surprisingly satisfying. But overall everything was just a bit too pricey for what we were getting.

The caccio e pepe was a bit too plain and unremarkable, and the pizza, while tasty, was quite soggy.</Text><Rating>3</Rating><Response>{'time': 1575572629156, 'text': "Hi Eric,\n\nWe're happy to hear that you enjoyed several aspects of your experience, but our team is disappointed to hear that the pizza and cacio e pepe did not meet your standards as they are both always a guest favorite.

<review>My dad and I had such a great lunch here! Service was wonderful, food was so so tasty, and the mocktail was delicioso. The prices are higher because everything is made in house (all vegan, plus vegan cheeses) and it’s very worth the splurge.

<Review>Truffle pizza is one of the best in LA.  However, the Caesar Salad should be called the Brutus Salad, because I felt like I was stabbed in the back.  This salad is horrible.  I've had better Caesar salads from Trader Joe's.

The service here is great.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.< /Review>< response>

My only two quibbles: it’s pricey (two pizzas, one salad, one beer = $100) and it is really, really loud. Had to shout across the table to be heard.</Text>< GmapID>

<review>I was super excited to try Double Zero as I'm a vegetarian and I always get excited knowing that I can eat anything on the menu! Since restaurants are closed due to Covid-19, I ordered this food for delivery via Postmates. I had a pizza and the Caesar salad. The pizza was really good, but the salad was not edible. It was wayyy over dressed and the lettuce was so soggy. It was a disappointment, but the pizza tasted delicious. Vegan cheese can always be a hit or miss, but this was definitely a hit! I hope to order from here again, but I definitely will not make the mistake of getting the salad unless I'm dining in.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Beautiful ambiance at night. My sister and I went the night before to check out the scene before bringing our vegan sister for her 55th birthday. Service was great. Great chopped salad, wine options we bought a bottle and a few glasses for our party of 6, loved the different pizzas minus the Pepperoni with "sprinkled" pepperonis. Will be back.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Its ok. The cheese was delicious, great buttery creamy taste. The sauce was ok, tasted like maybe they add some salt and oil, so that was nice.  The issue was the crust and crumb.  If this is Il Taglio pizza then this is a poor representation. If this is a Cali take on Roman style pizza then....ok its average at best. Maybe I came on an "off" dough type of day. I will be back to try again and see if they are able to produce a light airy tasty crust. If I were local I would try more of the delicious looking variety pies they offer. If you're a pizza nerd this place will disappoint. Hoping for the best next time around</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

The food is absolutely incredible- decadent. The pizzaiola is a head of Cauliflower with roasted chick peas, tomatoes and magic... so so good.  The eggplant parm is beyond delicious.  Don’t miss the chopped salad.  All 100% must trys!< /Review>

<Review>Ordered Couple of pizzas to go and was asked to wait 30 minutes, however it was not ready after 45 minutes. Had to wait over one hour to get two pizzas to go. Tried to eat the pizza but it was unbaked and the mushrooms and kale was not edible. Seemed like the order was rushed due to some mixup. Do not recommend this place.</Review></record></dataset><record>

The pizzas are pretty good but the ambiance (acoustics, to be specific) is overwhelming. The music is so loud that it feels like one is at a night club and not at an upscale restaurant. The music completely out of place and makes the place feel smaller than it is.

Service was fine. The price point is high for what is currently offered.< /text>

Vegan pizza and other italian-ish dishes in a trendy space right off Lincoln Blvd. I had the truffle pizza which included cashew cream, mushrooms, kale, lemon all flavored like truffle. Was super tasty. Slightly pricey at $22 but the vibe and flavors keep this place at 5 stars.< /Review>

We went in a Friday night and it was very crowded! But the waiting was worth it! Amazing pizza, the best vegan/gluten free ever! We tried the pesto and the margherita. If I lived here, I would go every week! Amazing!</review>

<Review>Delicious pizza, great service, nice atmosphere.

We ordered the Pepperoni and the Bianca as well as the meatballs. Also got the hazelnut and pistachio gelato for dessert. Everything was delicious and the pizza made great leftovers for the next day.

A great addition to area as the only dedicated plant based pizzeria in the area.  It was a tough decision when choosing my pizza,  I will be returning to try everything on the menu 😋< /Review><UserId.>100689866276942609291< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Another awesome spot discovered thanks to OTM. This place is completely plant based and although I'm a carnivore I can enjoy a good vegan joint if it's worth it! Double Zero is super cute with wine bottle lined walls dim lights and communal high top tables it's the kind of ambiance perfect for a date night or girls night out! I came here for the Sunflower Caesar but I stayed for their Truffle Pizza - all vegan.The dough was perfect but the pizza as a whole was just slightly oversalted, couldn't tell it was vegan though so that's a win! The salad was good but wish it had a more dominant dressing or some kind of 'cheese' flakes in it- seemed like it was mising something. Server was friendly! Overall, with a few tweaks, I think this has the potential to be every diners destination and a stand out amongst vegans!</review>

I dined at Double Zero through the OffTheMenu app. From the experience that I had on Saturday night, it was clear that this restaurant does not value customer experience.

I did a walk-in around 7:30pm when there were over 10 empty seats (and this was communal style dining so multiple parties were on each “table”). At first I noticed the host was cleaning off tables right in front of me and dismissed me. I ignored it and approached him and mentioned that I was going to be using OffTheMenu and only wanted a quick 10 minute dine-in. At the time, there were no other parties waiting to be seated.

When he took down my information on the iPad, he selected 35 minutes instead of 25 minutes which was the first option. Again, I ignored that. He told me that I could go wait by the bar, so I did. I ended up getting a drink, and the bartender Matt was very friendly. I was standing near the bar for a good 40 minutes. At some point, I spotted one seat empty at the bar and saw the host walk by so I asked him if I can sit there as again, I only wanted to have a quick 10 minute in and out meal. He declined and said no one can sit there.  I noticed a party of four behind me that asked him if they can finally sit down and he quickly seated them.

At this point, I approached him again and asked why there were parties that came after me that were being seated. I also mentioned again that I wouldn’t sit for long at all and that I had to be somewhere and if I can simply sit on one of the multiple empty seats that had been empty for whole 40 minutes I was there. He wasn’t friendly at all and said I couldn’t be seated and claimed the bigger parties had reservations, which wasn’t the case because if a party has reservations, they get seated when they arrive as there were plenty of seats, yet they were standing and waiting at the bar like me.

Then I directly asked him why bigger parties are being seated and not me even after 40 minutes. He then said that “we prioritize larger parties” and was not apologetic at all. This was shocking.

He walked away and I noticed a seat clear up at the bar and I asked Matt (bartender) if I can sit there and sat down. When the host saw me sit down he came up to me to say I can finally be seated after 45 minutes. I ask him where it is and it’s one of the exact tables that had been empty the whole time. I told him I’m fine sitting at the bar as I just wanted a quick meal and if I can get the card (contact information) of the manager. He tells me that she doesn’t have a card and instead of remotely apologizing for his terrible behaviour or attitude, he brushes off my request.

It’s a shame that the food might have potential, but the front-end staff is poor at their job and lack basic customer service skills. For this reason, I would not recommend any solo diners to come here for sure. The hosts are more concerned with bigger parties and tips than actually being welcoming to all patrons of the restaurant.

The reason I was asking for the manager’s contact information was because I had to leave for somewhere at 8:15 and it was already 8:20 when I sat myself at the bar. The manager came over shortly after to speak to me. I explained to her what had happened with the host and she nonchalantly claimed she thought I was with the random guy at the bar that I was standing next to and conversing with to kill time. It was never acknowledged that the larger party had been prioritized and seated before me.

She later admitted that it should be first come and first serve as I had been there prior to all the parties as there were a bunch of empty seats. It seemed as if they just wanted to comp me a free item or dessert, once I mentioned I would be writing a review, without acknowledging what had happened.

The restaurant should work on hiring better trained front-end staff that know how to deal with diverse diners. It’s not always about big parties and big tips, but actually creating a pleasant atmosphere that welcomes all patrons of the restaurant.<//Review>

<Review>Amazing new edition to Venice’s restaurant scene. Beautiful new wine bar, Only a short walk away from Abbot Kinney and is 100% plant-based. The pizza is even better than the New York City location, which is saying a lot. Welcome to the neighborhood!<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

Fantastic service, great pizzas, fabulous meatballs and cauliflower. The cacio e pepe was delicious with great pasta texture. However the Tiramisu  was the worst I've ever had. I've had raw vegan ones that taste 10000 times better. I'll be back, but skip the Tiramisu.  It tasted like a can of unsweetened coconut cream. Best pizza crust and flavor options though! The semolina cake was good, the gelato not so much.</Text>

< Review>
MY NEW FAVE VEGAN JOINT. Who ever thinks plant based items aren't tasty, think again. Double Zero masters vegan dishes, from pizzas to non-pizzas.

I discovered this place with my Off The Menu app (membership app where you get to redeem a free item of food everyday in LA. Check them out!) OTM was featuring Double Zero's Sunflower Caesar Salad and oh my word it's delicious. Made with wood fired croutons and almond parmesan, this salad took me to vegan heaven. I enjoyed it with a glass of white wine *pinky up*

Their pizza selection is also tasty -- i went for the Margherita. My italian roots would be proud. The plant based meatball was excellent as well!

The ambiance and customer service was 11/10.

Overall I really enjoyed discovering this vegan spot and my experience was well worth it! Highly recommend coming here for lunch or even a cute date spot!</Review>

Ate here on a Friday night with a reservation. Their "bar" area was a little awkward and had no seating but they were able to seat us a bit before our reservation time when we were early. We had the pepperoni, cacio e pepe, caesar salad, and olive oil cake. The pizza was incredible. Cacio e pepe was also very tasty. Caesar salad and olive oil cake were both a little underwhelming. Will definitely be returning to try more of the pizzas and pasta though!< /Text>

<text>Truffle pizza to die for.
Regarding pasta, I order Alfredo sauce pasta and it was not al dente, it was undercooked. Manager insisted about the way of cooking a pasta, I know how al dente should be. I just sent the pasta back.
Other than that, everything perfect.<//text>< Date>

<Review>Expensive...close to overpriced. I did not have to pay to eat here. We got one of almost everything. Cashew cheese is not cheese and it's sweet. Everything tasted like it needed salt. The pizza crust is fantastic. The sauce not so much - bland and uninteresting. The chopped salad was excellent. The giant fava beans were pointless. The meatballs are meh. Truffle pizza had way too many greens. And the gluten free crust was God awful - gritty and flavorless. Excellent wait service and excellent drink choices. Kind oglf dumbfounded that this place does not serve organic anything and it's so pricey.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

“Gluten free” pizza was terrible, it was like they took two pieces of pita bread and cooked them in the oven. I have never had such bad pizza crust in my life. On top of this my fiancé who is celiac got very very sick from eating the “gluten free” pizza. Very disappointed with this restaurant would not recommend it to anyone.</Review>

So delicious. Cannot believe it’s vegan! Pasta Bolognese is tdf and the baked meatball tastes just like the real thing only better. The peach gelato was perfectly sweet, fresh and creamy. The house red and white wines were fantastic. Can’t wait to go back and try everything off the menu!< /Review>

< Review>
Disappointed to give 2 stars when my partner and I were excited to eat their Vegan Pizza. We ordered the “Bianca” for pick up. Kaitlyn explained it’s a 45min wait which was no problem for a busy Sunday night. We showed up closer to pick up time and patiently awaited what appeared to be online the best vegan pizza we would have. We are low gluten eaters not completely gluten free, we ordered a gluten free crust as a preference. Also ordered the semolina cake.

The restaurant ambience and set is excellent. Kaitlyn was very sweet and kept us up to speed on our order.
When we finally got our order, and reached home in 5 min, famished and excited to eat this pizza, well here is the review

Pros:
Excellent customer service on pick up
Honest about preparation time
Bianca Toppings: Excellent vegan nut cheese on the pizza
Dessert: Excellent ice cream and moistness on top and outer part of the Semolina Cake

Cons
Burnt crust: for gluten free crusts when the edge is burnt almost halfway in from the edge of the crust well it was chewy and we pretty much couldn’t eat the ends and about an inch from the ends it was a waste.
Toppings: Excessively salty kale, it was over seasoned beyond what you typically get in a restaurant.
Right there with a burnt crust and salty kale the pizza became off putting. Just ate the middle parts out of hunger.
Dessert: Dry flour in the middle of the Semolina Cake

At $21 (pizza) $3 (gluten free) + $11 (cake) + gratuity which we were generous due to service and assumptions it would be great food. Sadly disappointed. Over $35 spent for a dinner that we are still hydrating over today because there was sooooo much salt on the pizza topping.

I also will point out we walked to the sister restaurant first “Plant Food Wine” and they redirected us to the “Double zero” sister restaurant for the pizza as they do not carry pizzas. This is not clear on the website.

From google search Double Zero, or Plant Food Wine and both restaurant sites link to “Matthew Kenney Cusine” So we figured pizza is served at both. Nope! That’s what we discovered after a 15 min walk to “Plant Food Wine” and ended up doing take out from “Double Zero”. It was an eventful Sunday Night. When you google it then you have to go breakdown what is served at each  restaurant before you choose to eat here.

Will I eat here again? No
Will I recommend this place? No
Why? well, first impression - no standardized cooking procedures in place and if it’s a busy night the staff panic and as a customer we felt it and saw it in the products. This is unacceptable for a restaurant that prides itself on being high end serving celebrities.

Sorry Double Zero. Zero flavor pizza.< /Review>

Renowned chef or not, restaurants that think it's ok for customers to go home hungry will never be my favorites. We ordered 2 entrees for 2 people, we are not big eaters, felt like we should have ordered 2 aperizers, 3 entrees and 1 desert and we are by no means big eaters. It was disappointing enough 3 tinny meatballs accompanied by only tomato sauce and a miniscule dab of cheese showed up, they didn't taste that good; then after waiting for close to 30 minutes, the Margherita showed up, never seen one so naked, it's 95% tomato sauce and a few drops of cheese, see the picture, sorry it's blurry. The very liquid fresh tomato sauce used on both dishes was too tangy.</text>

<review>We stopped in here as our second restaurant of the night after eating Plant Food and Wine, also a Matthew Kenney restaurant. Immediately when we walked in we noticed the ambiance which felt refined yet comfortable. One wall of the restaurant was lined with glass back lit wine bottles and really added some extra dimension to the visual appeal. We were seated by a handsome and helpful gentleman and then immediately attended to by our server Matt. He was fabulous and very helpful with the menu, making suggestions and sharing just enough personally to make us feel welcome and comfortable but not enough to make us feel awkward. He made some suggestions and we ended up ordering the Cacio E Pepe pasta, the Giaganrte Bean Pizza and the Truffle Pizza. The pizzas are personal size which makes everything better to share. The pizzas were perfect in taste and not too big and the portion of pasta was small but just right. We didn’t stay for dessert this time but willl definitely be back!< /review>< pictures>

<user_id>104085153011227119815</user_id><Rate>5</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) The taste of the pizza baked on the oven is what makes it so real.

The atmosphere is good and you can have a good time with wine.

It's great for friends gatherings and family visiting business gatherings.

Friendly service is also good.

It's a pity that the tables are narrow, but still enjoy the best taste.

Recommended for those who like vegetarian with good people.

Parking should be done through street parking.

You can post.
Enjoy a delicious pizza at home at a great price

The restroom is clean.

One of the places I want to find again Double Zero !!!

화덕애서 구운 피자의 맛은 정말 다시 찾게 만드는 맛입니다.

분위기도 좋고 와인과 함께 좋은 시간을 가질 수 있는 곳입니다.

친구들 모임에도 좋고 가족단위 방문 비지니스 모임에도 좋습니다.

친절한 서비스도 좋습니다.

테이블이 좁게 배치된 것이 아쉽지만 그래도 최고의 맛을 즐겨보시기 바랍니다.

좋은 사람즐과 함께 채식을 좋아하는 분들이라면 추천합니다.

주차는 스트릿파킹을 이용하여야 하며 예약을 하시면 더 좋겠지요

투고 가능합니다.
좋은 가격에 맛있는 피자를 집에서 드셔보세요

화장실도 청결하게 관리가 되어 있네요

All is good, it costs a bit more, and it is a good deal when you consider travel time and convenience. They are real down home here and polite and kind. The vegetables we looking OK, not a huge selection, but again enough to make a wonderful meal. A good time for all. Smile and enjoy you time travel. What Fun!< /review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Good selection of convenience basics and some grocery (even quality health options!), priced on the high end of fair, probably because of the remote area. Definitely best option in the area for most quick necessities & lite shopping. Dustin is the best clerk year after year. Try the locally made soap at the register... Beautiful and oh so fragrant- A perfect gift<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

The new paint job looks great! The owners and employees who work here are generally pleasant and helpful. the cheeses from Petaluma and the local sausage are really delicious. They even have Annie's organic brand products and a great selection of spices. Such a comprehensive selection of products in a relatively small space. Overall a great place!<//Text>

<Review>Nice place.  Weekend rates are 14 an hour and 11 an hour during the week.   Lessons are being given on the other courts while you play.   For the money you pay I would want a little more privacy and to not heat the class next to you talking about their super bowl plans for an hour.<//Review>< pics>

The tennis instructors play really bad. I expect my instructor to offer something that I can't. Some of them do not even know how to serve. I can't understand the need to hire people of such caliber.< /Text>

I could swear I have reviewed this place before. It is a great local music and theater venue. Like a good high School auditorium. Great acoustics and sight lines. As well as comfy seats and reasonable leg room. Beer and wine at intermissions, usually.<//text>

Please, I encourage us north staters to support them so we don't lose them! Theater has all good seats at a nice angle so people don't block your view and really good acoustic sounds.

<Review>I must admit I thought when they said there isn't a bad seat in the house I thought it was a lie, now I know it's the truth. Great venue to see a show, I'd love to see an unplugged show there the acoustics are great and it's a small enough place to give you an intimate experience. The best thing I can tell you is I'll definitely go back.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x809cd4a150fe0f4f:0x3c4958093f7587a8</Gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< user>

Incredible experience, as truck drivers not too often we have had delivery so amazingly good as this one. To start the delivery came earlier that the expected time, the food quality, presentation and flavor was THE BEST, my vegetarian plate looked and tasted perfect, my hubby's combo platter & added falafel were exquisite  and the lentil soup was amazing. Everything that was supposed to be hot arrived super hot and the cold dishes were cold. Very affordable and priced acoordingly to the amount, quality and taste of the food. Will definetly order again and if possible visit the restaurant next time (and everytime) we come to Pasadena. Highly recommended.</review>

2nd time ordering for take out since new mgmnt and still have incomplete order.  Want to support the local eatery, but have order complete.  Prices a bit high for what you get compare to others around the area, food good.< /review>

I have been surfing for good halal restaurants but didn't realize this place is next to my home. This is one the best Kabob places in Pasadena and in fact to my opinion, the best place in LA.. I tried their chicken louleh wrap and beef burger....loved  every single bites...5 star place to eat. Interior is nice, clean, and cosy. They have designed parking in the back...there are lots of street parking as well. Customer service is EXCELLENT!!!!! Bring your family to indulge delicious parsian food.< /Text>

Food is not bad, but definitely not worth the price. For this price you can get better kebabs. The people and service are very nice though.<//Text>

< Review>
I came for my 'burger cravings'. To my astonishment, this is the best halal burger in LA within a reasonable price. We loved it!! We went for burger, later ordered a mixed kabab plate as it was hard for us to leave without having more of their meat! 😆 . The beef kabab melts in the mouth and is so flavorful!!
The restaurant is clean and the service is very good. Definitely our next fav place!.<//Review>

<Response>None</Response><Text>We just went there for the first time today. The chicken tenders were OK but not fabulous, but all three kabobs were delicious -- we got the lamb kabob, chicken kabob, and shish kabob, all on rice, and they were a big hit with us and the friends we shared them with. Great hummus, too. This place is absolutely a keeper; we'll be back and we're bringing our appetites. :-)

Oh, and as a bonus, the guy who took our orders was hilarious. He made us laugh and we loved him.< /Text>< Pics>

If you're looking for a trendy place to eat, this won't be your cup of tea. What you get in this place though is Friendly service and good food. I had the chicken cutlets,  and enjoyed it very much. Will be there again to try other food items.<//Text>

Incredibly consistent, moist and tender chicken kabob, whether you come for lunch or for dinner. The rice is fluffy and fantastic. Their lunch specials will fill you up without emptying your wallet. Good healthy food.

Sure Zankou is five minutes closer to me, but if you like smaller mom-and-pop places, with a low-key ambience (like I do), this place fits the bill. Their hours have changed from their website, however; they now close at 9pm on weekdays.<//review>

Nope, no luck. The food tastes not bad but not worth for 14 dollar. It should have been 6 dollars. I stay be a faith ful customer of Sahara.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Been there a couple of times now. Food is good, tasty and the new owners have recently remodeled the entire place. Could say the food is slightly expensive but then so is everything else in L.A.</Review>

Amazing taste and delicious vegetarian options too! Will strongly recommend vegeterian plate and chicken shawarma on plate(instead of sandwich). Also the humble lentil soup is very filling.</Text>

Wide selection of kabobs of decent quality. The chicken kabobs were pretty good, thought the combo plate is a little sparse aside from a large amount of included rice.</text>

Little place, great service and the chicken is so tender and juicy.  I usually have the combo which is a lot of food but everything is so delicious.< /review>

<review>Small little hole in the wall restaurant. Came around 3pm and it was pretty empty. Ordered the shish kabob with hummus, came with rice.

Everything was average. The meat wasn't marinated well enough so you can still taste and smell the original smell. The rice wasn't that flavorful either compared to other places I've tried.<//review></record>

<Review>Been coming here for the last 2 years and I can't exactly say that their version of mediterranean food has ran out its course on my taste buds, meaning their offerings are as tasty and healthy as during the first time I came here. The owner and the guys working here have been so dedicated in maintaining quality and friendly environment. The prices may have gone up a bit but the offerings deserve what they're worth.

Come here and have a taste of really good mediterranean food!

PS: this place has the best falafel among all the places I have been!</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) A restaurant where you can eat shishi kebabs in the United States. The onions, which are skewered with meat and baked on a skewer, are very delicious. Dipping sauce also has a refreshing acidity and goes well with meat. The shop's older brothers are also friendly and impressive.

(Original)
アメリカでは出色のシシケバブが食べられる店。肉と一緒に串に刺して焼く玉ねぎが非常に旨い。つけダレもさっぱりとした酸味があり、肉によく合う。お店のお兄さんも、皆フレンドリーで好印象。<//review>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>So overall experience was not horrible. The beer wasn’t bad simply wasn’t cold enough for our liking. Everyone has a preference and this one just didn’t live up to our expectations. One flight and we had to move one. Not blaming the workers not their fault. I’m sure they don’t have temp control access. We just like our beer cold 🥶< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRdO0fZDwRsY8Wb69Rk8UDQgckY1Ut3R75Tvqr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9NAMHSvH99b_u6gj8R0NVlc7MjQYJcQdfCKPm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Great beers, friendly staff, clean inside, and convenient location just off the 15 freeway.  The bar and indoor seating area is limited.  Park on or across the street, parking lot is very small.<//review>

<Review>The staff was nice, she told us about their beers . Had a couple of different beers and they were delicious. The peanut alert was was my favorite and so was the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Ale. Only beer I disliked was the Jalapeno beer. It was just a bit too much for me. Overall I highly recommend this place.</Review>< Rate>

<review>The staff welcomed us and our Labradors with open arms. Great selection of beers, loved their Red Alert (creamy and smooth), the Turbulent Turbulence (hazy IPA) and the Malbec Barrel Aged Jess Y James (Stout). They even have bottles and crowlers. Will definitely come again soon.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqRFJBpzKNVqs7bouxwMltHdbfUP62LSb703w5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGPo8gnwS1AEGVBuG9Qji5asHjC3SwnnOP5LyN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80db7f95e735494f:0x149167294b73d40a<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Beer and pizza tabs are separate. Their beers are nice and humble.  The pizza is a choose-your-own or choose pre-made for about $10 that's shareable. The service was professional and efficient. However, I'm not going to go out of my way to come back here. It's as three stars dictate: okay.<//Review>< userid>

Nothing wrong with the place, but the beer they make is not the beer I like.  I went in and had a great experience.  The waitstaff was friendly, the beer was priced well.  Everything about the place was a great feel.  Very homey feel, not appealing to the ambiance, but about the beer they make.  Most of their beers are stout/porter beers.  I just am not a fan of that type.  I had a few anyway, and they were not bad.  I assume if you truly like that type of beer, you will enjoy the place.</Review>

You can bring food in from outside and they even have a discount promotion with the Naughty Pig. Favorite beers are the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie Ale (ORCA) and the Belgian Dubbel Vission. Always get a few pints and some Crowlers to go.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80db7f95e735494f:0x149167294b73d40a< /GmapID></record>

Fun little brew pub that has some real good base brews. Offers sasspersrilla for those are designated driver. A couple of specials like ten dollar crowler of a signature brew on Sunday. Others on Tuesday and Wednesday.</Review>

My wife and I Walked in on Jan. 23, about 5:15pm and bellied up to the bar, looking forward to a cold draft.  Bartender walked by and acknowledged us twice in 10 minutes, but was more busy chatting with some friends at the bar than anything else.  There was nobody else in the place!  After waiting for what we felt was more than adequate time to get served, we walked out and went to another brewery in town.  Disappointing service.</text>

<text>Great selection of beers and all are made well.  Some pretty interesting stuff too.  Try the espresso infused pale ale.  It is ridiculous!  Marvin and Joe are not afraid to take chances and use some unusual ingredients in their beers.  A "must visit" on your next trip to Temecula.< /text><rating>5</rating>< user>

Joe was awesome. Couldn’t ask for a better salesman. Doesn’t matter if it’s cars or mattresses, Joe knows how to provide enough attention and information without being overbearing and annoying. He was the reason I bought a mattress, nothing more nothing less.< /Text>

<Review>I just received my new mattress and adjustable frame today. I just want to say that Holly and Michael were great and very knowledgeable. They made it very easy for me, from payment to delivery appointment and answering questions when I called.
The two guys that delivered the bed were very nice and quick! I was so impressed I tipped them. Great job to all of you! And Thank you!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x809adf10afce7551:0x84653fd635a16e6a</gmap_id></record>

<review>The sales rep was great, but the delivery guys weren't. I payed for white glove service, which meant the would install the new bed and haul off the old one. When they showed up 4 hours late they just dropped off the new bed and left the old bed, so I hade to pay again whauled it out myself.<//review>< Rate>

It has been many years since I've had to purchase a bed, and I went to the Sleep First store to get the latest and most info I could about the newest options available for beds. Robert Hall was great because he was not only professional in attitude but was happy to answer my many questions.  He was very patient.  He helped me explore the options that were best for me and my husband, and we have very different and unusual sleeping needs due to health issues.  I was well-armed with the wealth of info Robert provided and happy with the space he gave me to test beds and make a decision, including returning with my husband to see if we could find the bed we would both appreciate.   We did find a high quality Sealy hybrid mattress that pleased us both.  I think we'll be very happy with it, and the price was very acceptable!  Thank you, Robert, for all your help!< /text>

<text>We stopped in the store last year, however weren’t quite ready to spend 5k on a new bed. Robert was very knowledgeable and friendly and jotted down our info and the bed we were interested in. We went back in today ready to purchase. Robert was there again today, looked up our info and we were just about ready to purchase our original bed. He showed us a new product that was on sale and we were sold. Not only did we purchase our new master bedroom bed, we purchased a mattress for our RV and our spare bedroom. All of these items were on sale and cost less than what we went in to buy originally. I highly recommend Robert at the Sleep First store at Sunrise and Greenback in Citrus Heights.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My friend and I dropped in to the store to just see what was available for a new guest bedroom.  The store manager, Robert , was very helpful and knowledgeable about the product.  I was able to find the perfect bed and accessories to fit my needs.  I highly recommend Sleep First Mattress.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>It’s pretty awesome that my salesman and myself have the same name-no relation- my wife and I came in for the Nectar and after trying a few other  mattresses in the foam department, I am proud to announce that we went with the Tempurpedic line. It felt the best out of all of the mattresses-it did cost more than what we anticipated, but well worth the investment. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a new mattress. We went to a couple of their competitors first and they were rude and the stores were messy-Robert greeted us with a warm smile and a very clean, great smelling store. My wife, Vanessa, was very impressed with the cleanliness of the bathroom-the others were not so clean.</review>< pics>

Our experience at Sleep First was excellent!
And it was excellent for one reason .....because of our salesperson Robert Hall. Super knowledgeable, patient, funny, attentive but not hovering, explained everything thoroughly, answered all my stupid questions  and handsome too! He’s awesome and I would recommend him to anyone who needs a new bed!<//text>

Excellent experience with Carolynn the Manager. Her knowledge is outstanding!
She was ‘patient’ and understanding knowing my particular needs in looking for a quality and comfortable bed.  After all It’s a big investment for me, or, anyone else for that matter.
Thank you Carolynn</Review>

After I entered the store, she offered me any assistance I needed. I then explained my needs in a bed and my spending limits, while she listened attentively and asked questions that further clarified my needs.

Carolynn then showed me to the best bed that I'd found (out of the 4 stores I'd been to), so since this was such a great bed and at my price, I bought it right then.

Now, I haven't received the bed yet (so I'll have to write a separate review when I've lived with the bed for 8 months or so), but the customer service is great. You really feel like you are being listened to.

I am a 100% disabled veteran with special sleep needs, I decided to use a local vender and chose Sleep First. When I arrived I was greeted by Josh and the owner Xavier, I shared with them what I was looking for in a bed and they showed me the different models that fit my specific needs. They were courteous, knowledgeable and cared about what I needed, they never left my side, I found what I needed and closed the deal. I recommend Sleep First to anyone looking for a great selection of products and the best customer service experience... second to none!!

Great selection of spring, foam and hybrid Temper-pedic and Sealy mattresses. Salesman was helpful, patient, friendly and well informed about the product they carry. The store is new and clean! They have delivery service and pick up your old mattress.</review>

<review>I absolutely love this store, they have everything Home Depot has sometimes more, but the deal is it's all laid out and I'm more simpler straightforward fashion usually it's a little less sometimes a lot less in terms of price, I just can't say enough good things about this store.  if you need help the store manager Neil is an amazing Insight with great resources and tips and understands all the products in a store as staff go to Great Lengths to ensure customer satisfaction, I will definitely shop here and would strongly suggest you do as well< /review>< Name>

Great shop, very helpful, good prices, had the basics in stock. Example: I needed tempered windows for a bathroom and they had a few in stock, unlike home depot and another smaller window shop I called, who needed 4-8 weeks to order!< /Review>

Pros-Friendly staff, the price for one item is the same as the lot price, convenient drive through lumber yard, good selection.
Cons- it’s a do it yourself kind of place or for big companies. (If you need one on one help I suggest Dale in Fremont.)< /review>

Absolutely the worst hardware store in America.
No help anywhere in the store.
Finally got an employee to show up, but they couldn't find a tool to cut wire.
Half the products in the electrical department where miss placed or missing. No green earth wire? Really?!
Staff are obviously unhappy.
Conclusion. Go to Home Depot</text>

< review>
My father went into this store to buy $800 worth of material that had been loaded on to his truck and he asked for the veteran discount and he showed his Identification card from the DMV that had his veteran status on it, as he well deserved because he served our country in the US Airforce . He has gotten the discount before in this same store and the assistant manager ( Neal Robinson) told him anyone could put that symbol on the ID and he couldn't give him the discount . How can someone alter a government issued identification card especially when they served our country in the time of need. We are a proud American military family. I didn't want to use the race card but Neal Robinson wouldn't have acted this way if my father wasn't Hispanic . Not veteran friendly!!!! Discriminating and offensive.<//review>

My visit for vision test and a new pair of glasses was above expectation. The receptionist was very nice, carefully followed guidelines of current pandemic precautions in cleaning and sanitation steps. Dr. Yu was very caring, professional, patiently answered all my questions. I liked the frame and glasses with many extras beyond the insurance coverage. Dr. Yu gave me a very nice price and discount. I will definitely recommend Dr. Yu for vision checks and correctional vision treatment. Thank you Dr. Yu.< /text>

This is my second year going to Neovision and every time I am very pleased with professionalism, cleanliness, and prompt service. Dr. Yu is very nice and I never felt rushed. I recommend this clinic to my family.</review>

<time>1593294255569<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>i was treated really well, with care and patience - especially while trying on my sunglasses. the only thing i did'nt like is that i called 3 times that day to change my appt to a later time and no one answered any of those times. when i arrived i was told that my appt was changed to be 30 minutes later and that was frustrating since no one had informed me and thus i rushed to get to my original appt time.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I found it always to be easy to get an appointment. And if I was on time the whole  exam process was pretty swift.

I've gotten glasses, soft contacts, and hard contacts here! I've never had a problem with any of the things I've bought. They have a good selection of sunglasses and glasses and I'm impressed by how thoroughly they explained my insurance!<//text><Time>1470958952231<//Time>< userid>

<text>Very friendly and helpful. I struggled to get contacts on for 2 days and they were willing to be patient with me for a few hours each day. I would recommend them to anyone. They have a mound of paperwork they are always working on each time I come in and yet they always get everything I request in a very timely manner.< /text>< pics>

The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were very patient in helping me out on my contacts. Although it took a long time, they were never frustrated. Dr. Yu was very efficient and professional and made our visit short and pleasant. My visit was a success.</text>

Staff were not friendly and I was rushed out the door. The prescription I was given was not helping so I had to go somewhere else. I can not recommend this place in good conscience.<//Text>

She also is concerned of your health not only with your vision and the staff helps you with things that customers need to know about frames and filing of claims to your health insurance.</Text>

I first came to Neovision Optometry over 10 years ago, and even though I've long since moved away from San Diego, I always make sure to come here for my annual checkup when I'm back visiting family.

When I first came here, Dr. Yu recommended that I try out CRT lenses. When I started the process of wearing them, she was extremely helpful over the course of several visits to make sure that my eyes were adjusting properly. It worked out great, and ever since then I've been happily wearing CRT lenses at night, and being completely free of glasses or contacts during the day. Every year, I go in for my annual checkup and Dr. Yu adjusts my prescription as needed and orders me a new pair.

The office is very responsive and friendly, and I never need to wait long when I arrive for my appointment. The appointment itself is always efficient, and I always end up with a new pair of lenses that lasts me for the year without any problems. I've never had any issues with my insurance either (I have VSP).

Overall, I'm a very satisfied long-time customer of Neovision Optometry. If you're considering CRT lenses, or anything else, check them out!</text>

Dr. Yu is a very professional and amazing Doctor. And her team is incredibly friendly and accommodating . From the moment you walk into this place you are treated like their family members. The staff are there to guide you through all your needs from insurance to contact lens or eye glass fitting. There are great options for glasses and sunglasses. The staff will make sure you will get anything and everything you need. My daughter's eyes are very sensitive and dry., but Dr. Yu uses her knowledge to solve all her problems. One thing I must mention is that you can call or stop by anytime to get Dr. Yu and the staff's  help and answer your questions.  I am pleased to say our family found the best Optometrist in Dr.Yu.  Please bring your business to this place,  you would never have to go to another Optometry every again .</Text>

<text>I was told to get my glasses "Within 2 weeks, usually 5-7 days", but it took over 40 days!  When you order your glasses, they try to add all the options, then if it doesn't fit on you, they don't seem to care about it.</text>< Pics>

<text>Thank you for the exam and advice.
I have been unable through my primary caregiver to obtain the name of a neuro ophthalmologist. Do you have someone to refer to me?
Thank you so much.

As soon as we walked in, we had a very warm welcome from the girl at the register. We took a while too order and she was very patient. All the staff was very polite and catered to all our needs. Always checking in on us to make sure we were doing OK.
The place was very clean, quiet, and the food was amazing. We even took some home after. This restaurant was definitely worth stopping by, this was our first time here and will for sure be coming back again. The service was very fast and all the dishes came out perfect.
Thank you to all the staff making us feel at home and cooking us delicious food. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an authentic, home made Indian food.< /review>< Pics>

Uhm, I had the vegetarian lunch option. It was all mush. It tasted like it was two days old and reheated. Also the guy who took my order was not very friendly. I waited outside for my order and realized they just left my order on the counter for me to come pick it up even though I was going to dine in.
I’m hoping this was just a bad batch but who knows. I’ve had waaaaay better Indian along with extremely friendly service. Also judging from the comments, all my Indian peeps agree with me on the quality! 🤣<//Review>

Their Navratan Korma is our veg goto whenever we want some decadent veg food. Try their sweet rice pudding. Friendly folks.</text>

THE WORST. They somehow managed to take the best thing out of Indian food- THE FLAVOR! If you want authentic flavors this is not it. Ordered 3 different items and they were all so bland we decided not to eat any of it. The curry taste like cream and the meat was so tough. Was hoping by the higher prices it would be better than our usual spot but ended up with the opposite and a hangry husband. Save your money and don’t go.< /Text>

Exceptional butter chicken, near my favorite, but its a little expensive, although the staff is friendly, and it all tastes so good!

I found it very similar to Anarkali, which is my favorite - this place is excellent too! I plan on going back regularly, when I can afford the extra few bucks.<//text>

<review>A bit pricey for presentation and taste. Small inside. We were seated, given menus and water and then told by the waiter/cashier we were suppose to order at the front BEFORE being seated. What?? Another waiter comes up to us after we already ordered and asked if we were ready to order at our table?? Clearly one of them didn't know the protocol for the way the resteraunts are ran. NO Restrooms, which seems like a violation code since they have seats for people to dine in. 🤔😬 After our meal the waiter asks us about the food and if we like Rice Pudding, he offers to bring us some and never followed thru . We literally saw him walk and and never came back. Bad service is why they deserve a bad review.</review><Time>1575710139248< /Time>< GmapID>

Wanted a hot quick meal and didnt want the usual, burger pizza, Chinese. Curry bowl hit it on all levels. Rich hot curry mild for m . The flavor perfect. The naan still hot even after my 20 min drive home. I will be back to try something different next time.</Review>

TOTAL RIP-OFF -- BUYER BEWARE!  If you order lamb in any sauces, they do not server you lamb if they think you won't know the difference.  They will serve cheaper meat -- NOT LAMB!  False advertising/bait and switch tactics here - shady and illegal!  I made the mistake of ordering take-out on my first (and last) visit.  Called them about the 'fake lamb' and they said they "made a mistake."  The only "mistake" they made was suspecting that I had no idea of the real texture and flavor of lamb.  Also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala.  While the chicken was at least real, it was VERY DRY and the Tikka Masala sauce just tasted like cream of tomato soup (probably was -- that is on their menu).  As cream of tomato soup, it was good; but as Tikka Masala sauce, it was boring -- I had to add my own Punjabi spice packet when I got my food home.  OVER-PRICED -- small portions for prices charged considering it is a' la carte.   DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.< /Text>

Durning the pandemic 4/2020 I went to Stanton off Kings Canyon ,Fresno because I needed driving glasses. They talked me into 2 pairs of glasses which costs me a $1000 cash . I thought it was expensive but if they were everything they said they would be then I thought maybe it was worth it. I waited for them to call me to let me know when they would be ready but they never did, the number listed was just a busy signal so after a few days of trying to call I gave up and drove the 50 miles to get them. Only one pair was ready so I put them on and could not see out of them, they argued with me saying I needed to get use to them. When I went back to tell them that I didn’t want them they said they couldn’t refund my money and gave me my second pair and again told me to wear them that I would get use to them. I had a car accident while wearing them but they still refuse to do anything for me</text>

Stanton optical on Kings Canyon was great! All the staff was really friendly and prompt. Even during the pandemic, they made me feel really comfortable! John was super sweet and helpful and walked me through the promotions and gave me several options. I definitely recommend coming here for your vision care. Also the office is really clean with lots of glasses options!<//text>

<Text>This is an update to a previous review, which was written while they were looking over my shoulder, I was told my insurance would be accepted and I would be reimbursed the nearly $300. Come to find out they don't accept my insurance at all, simply waited until AFTER I paid to tell me that. I feel scammed. The girls were nice, and the service was nice, but they purposely waited until I paid to tell me my insurance isn't accepted and I wouldn't be getting my money back. I was sort of forced into that first review, they wouldn't take my payment until I wrote the review. I wrote it with truth, they are covid safe, and they are very nice. but I was scammed. I guess they know 21 year old kids don't know how the system works and they can just take our money, I don't know, I feel let down. I thought I found a warm place with a doctor who cares about my eye health, but no, they just wanted the dollar.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Very nice and helpful place. Super cheap. I heard about this place from my mother in law who took her daughter in and came out with three new frames for under $200! I come in and leave with 6 months worth of new contact lenses and a new frame for nearly the same amount. The staff is really nice they are busy and they leave you alone a lot to help other but it’s understandable they are giving attention to every costumer. They have Covid safely procedures such as have the main doctor on a screen in the exam room and they practice social distancing as well as having bins for all glasses anyone has touched to be sanitized. I will be coming back for COLORED contacts which are hard to find and some prescription sunglasses :)<//Review>

The greeter obviously has no training, had no idea how to approach the most basic request.  I decided to give her a chance to assist me, but she really had no idea how to proceed.  At the same time training was going on the Sales floor, while customers were being ignored.  And all this toxic behavior was being encouraged by management that were participating in the problem.

< Review>
I went into the store for the second time with the same problem. The first time a young lady let me know that there was nothing she can do at the store but if I wanted to send the glasses back to get fixed I’d have to pay the 20% (not sure the percentage). The glasses were very loose and I needed them tightened.  I left frustrated because I had just bought the glasses within the last 2 months at the time. A couple months later I go back ready to deal with issue and pay whatever what was needed. I was greeted by Nancy. She was professional and very patient. She was able to fix my problem. I left relieved and will definitely go back for another pair soon. Thank you.< /Review>

<Name>underdog09able<//Name><review>My experience at Stanton optical on kings canyon and chestnut was amazing. Nice clean, covid safe as can be. The manager John made my glasses buying experience beyond anything I thought possible. I been dreading buying new glasses. My old glasses been glued outdated prescription on them. I finally had to go to replace them. I went into Stanton. I met the manager John, and he seen my new prescription. I said in my mind my wife not here its hard picking out glasses alone I have to wait 30 minutes. Next thing John came back with my exact same frames same color and showed them to me. Then another black pair same profile. I was like yes these, before my wife came in the building I was like I am done. she said quit playing let's pick these frames out. I said I already did. I paid and everything. She seen my glasses picked she was like you did a great job. She said usually glasses place do not have the exact frames you had before.  I recommend manager John to anyone. Keep up the great work John in and out like the burger.🍔 👍 😀 👌 👏 😋 🍔 👌.<//review>< GmapID>

I bought 4 pairs of bifocal around 9 months ago. I got a great deal which is great for me. I break a lot of glasses. The frame on my favorite pair broke and I was still under warranty. Nancy found an identical frame and changed it out while I waited. While I was waiting I bought a pair of safety frames and lenses. Go there and get you glasses and contacts<//Text>

I came in for a eye exam and This place was amazing and super friendly. They assisted me and my family quickly and throughly. I loved the fact that they in-forced masks especially during covid not one person had there mask off. Also it was great cause you get to speak to the eye doctor and the eye assistants as well as the manager.< /review>

They did not clean any of the classes on display and did not care about who handled what .Then they really tried to up sale me on things I didnot need but tried to push that it would be nessasarry with my perscription. Even showed me some huge thick lenses i woould end up with if i did not pick the upgrade,which was a lie.The place is a total rip off !< /text>< pics>

My lenses were wrong. I was told they ordered the correct lenses and to come back in when they arrive to change them out. Iwas told in the meantime to just look down to be able to see.
That was over a month ago.</review>

< review>
This is my second time coming here. I put five stars because last time they give me free exam, and a worker name anna help me alot, talk to me about what i need in order i can see with my glasses, so friendly too, enjoy talking to her while were going with the process. Coming back here, spoke to john, very friendly guy, helps me alot too, recommended me to pick new material upgrades for my glasses. If anyone need glasses, this is the place where i recommend people to come, meet these wonderful excellent workers, going through the process is really easy.<//review>

Helped by Martha and was really pleased with the way she helped my wife and I
Worked with us to be able to afford glasses we needed.
Funny,smart and just made the experience pleasant.
Recommend you ask for her when exam is over and your ready to purchase
“Thanks Martha,your great”

<Review>I was worried about going to Stanton to look for glasses because I didn’t want to buy anything that was over priced. Krystal was extremely helpful in finding me 2 pairs of glasses that I love and at such a great price. Krystal was extremely patient and helped me the whole way through. I’ll definitely be going back to Stanton for my next pair!<//Review><username>Laura Montes< /username><rating>5</rating>< response>

First time coming in for an eye exam after a couple years of going without glasses, was a little nervous about it but I’m so glad I did!! Krystal helped me out a lot she was so patient and helpful everything was so quick and easy! She did go over frame selections and found what worked best for me. I highly recommend coming in they will work with you and find exactly what you need.<//review>

I was super excited to try this place out as it has wonderful reviews, so imagine my shock when I was asked to write a positive review for a percentage off my order. The ladies were nice at the store, but I felt straight up bamboozled when the lady asked me to write a positive review in front of her. Wish I chose somewhere more honest.<//Text>

Eye exam was quick. Friendly and helpful staffs. I would recommend friends and family to come here for eye exam and getting their prescription glasses. There’s many frame to choose from and they are great. Crystal was helpful. I would definitely come back here again if I ever needed a new prescription glass.</Text>

Love my new glasses 👓!!!They are super chic and receive a lot of complements. But most importantly I can see now!   The case my glasses came in is really cute too.  Staff is great specially Lily the manager who helped. I felt VIP service without the glamour cost. I will bring all my family here.<//review>

< Review>
Just had my contact exam and let me tell you. I was hesitant because I didn’t know how it would work with all this Corona going on but I was impressed. Everyone had their temperature taken when they came in. I was helped pretty quickly and the exam went smoothly. Mayra was patient with me cause it had been awhile since I had contacts and started to get impatient that I couldn’t get them in. After she brought me back in to make sure I could see clearly with them on. Lily helped me with my order. I was able to use my insurance and even got a pair of glasses 60% off. I was really hesitant to go through an exam during this time but I’m glad I chose Stanton. I would definitely recommend this store and make sure you ask for Lily, she’s awesome.<//Review>

<Review>How did I get charged $339 for 2 pair of glasses? I wanted to see if I can get my refund back so I called them and whoever picked up the phone say he will talk to his manager, and give me a call back. But he never called me back. So no I will have to wait til Monday to go in. I called on Saturday at 2 pm and they really didn't call me back. Im very disappointed.</Review>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><text>This is a review for the KINGS CANYON location in Fresno. Let me start out by saying I am a "problem patient" due to my right eye having very little vision. I have heard this almost every time I go to get an eye exam. I was first turned away from Stanton Optical in Clovis as they said they were referring me out elsewhere as they could not give me a prescription due to my issue. I had never been turned away from an eye exam before but ended up going to an opthalmologist who re-confirmed that I should still have been able to get a prescription by balancing my right with my left eye (as my old prescriptions have done).

I ended up giving Stanton Optical another shot (mainly due to their convenience of being open Saturdays), however I went to the Kings Canyon location in Fresno which was the furthest from where I live but it had the best ratings. I'm SO glad I went to this location. I started out by explaining my whole eye issue prior to wasting time with the exam and they flat out told me they were willing to try and work something out for me if I was willing to be patient as it could be a trial and error situation. Mayra was amazing! She was very professional, friendly, honest, and attentive the entire time while still helping other clients. I did not catch the name of the other lady that saw me first but she was also very friendly, professional, and really informative on the different brands of contacts they offer as well. I walked out of there with my first ever set of contacts and am very pleased with my visit. If you want someone who knows what they're doing I definitely recommend this location. This visit definitely flipped my opinion about Stanton Optical.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1596483329449, 'text': 'Hello Jessica,\nwe appreciate you took the time to give us 5 stars about the visit you made in Stanton Optical store, we want to inform you that we are constantly working to provide the best service to our patients and it is our satisfaction to know that Mayra was kind and polite with you in the store, we will not stop providing this kind of service to our patient to make them feel the best way, just to let you know if you need any further help you can visit us at any time.'}< /resp><GmapID>0x80945efc613c19a3:0xc47a87f84d9f3c3d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1</rating><text>It's been 4 months. I am waiting for my prescription.  My insurance changes at the end of this month, so I will lose out on my coverage for contacts. Store manage said she would have it ready months ago, then saturday, today district manager said I would have it by 6:30PM. Still no prescription.  How can I get prescription or exam credited back so I can go somewhere else. First order of contacts took two  months because they said I was unhappy. In which I was happy I just could not see with them big difference. Please help. I spoke to store manager, area manager, and now district manager. What's next! Also the reason for the wait is because doctor never signed the prescription but yet the store sold me a prescription and said they can continue to sell to me but can't give prescription until doctor signs because contacts can't be sold without doctor prescription. The only sense your making is that you will sell to me but no one else can because its illegal to sell without prescription.< /text>< Pics>

My mom was in need of reading glasses and I referred her to Stanton Optical because they are friendly, communicate well, and its near our home. They made my mom feel comfortable and I can tell she liked coming here.

I was in desperate need of glasses and contacts and with the help of Krystal the whole process went by super smooth and she was extremely polite, best customer service I’ve received in a really really long time. She definitely brightens up her working environment. Next time I need something I’m going to make sure she’s there to take care of me. Thank you Krystal!</Review>

I’m so glad I came to this location. I was greeted kindly and professionally. I really appreciated Lily for taking COVID-19 seriously and providing an environment that kept me at ease and comfortable with bringing my son. I spent under $250 for an eye exam and 3 pair of glasses with no insurance. I was very satisfied with my visit and would highly recommend.<//text>

< Review>
Very disappointing experience. Was not greeted by a rude receptionist who didn't even look up at me. The exam was very rushed and impersonal. I waited for over 2 and a half hours at my appointment with a room full of disgruntled patients who also had appointments. I thought the selection of glasses was very cheap looking. They try to upsell you as much as possible to then pretend that they are giving you some great deal. The staff try to appear to be busy by just walking around and leaving you waiting. I did not get to chose the type of contacts I wanted, they just order whatever they want. I spent almost $400 and I wish I would have went to Lenscrafters, I would've gotten a better deal and nicer glasses. Upon return to pick up my glasses, I had to wait another half an hour just to have someone go get my glasses out of a bin.  I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone and I will take my business elsewhere in the future.</Review>

I'm very pleased with my glasses. Although the frames included for $59.95 were a small selection, I found some I liked. The exam was thorough, and the staff was efficient and pleasant. I got sunglasses for an extra charge of $28, and the tinting is perfect!< /Text>

$452 for a bogo and none of the frames were name brand or even cute. I paid $452 out of pocket for glasses that were uneven on my face after I told them over and over they were uneven . I asked for my PD number to order frames elsewhere and just like the fitting on the glasses , they were no help. Should have went elsewhere as I started to do.< /Text>

I had a great experience this morning! I was a little anxious going in, but the staff there made the process so quick and easy. Jason helped me after my eye exam by answering all one million of my questions and explaining everything carefully and clearly. I'm so excited to pick up my glasses later today!</Text>

< Review>
I went in to get glasses everything was fine, unfortunately my vision up close was worse with the glasses then they were without them,(I went in because I needed glasses to drive). I went back in the following weekend for some type of adjustment; horrible, the person completely discounted everything I said and actually wiped the glasses and had me put them back on, and asked me if it was better, as if I didn't try that already. Then instead of offering to fix the problem said and I'm going to paraphrase; "if you want to you can get your old prescription and have us fill them." I just walked away. Never going back.< /Review>

Been hearing  about their promo of 2 glasses with a free eye exam for a while now, so I decided to check it out.  I was given a 2 pm appt today, was examined by a very professional and nice optometrist and to my surprise was advised I can pick up my 2 prescription glasses in an hour!!! The staff super nice and I got a good deal 👍 too.<//review>

<review>HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Will not be going again. I was there at 4:30 for eye appointment and did not end up leaving till 7:30pm. When we were sitting with the lady putting our order for the glasses she kept getting up and leaving us to tend to people waiting to pick up glasses and coming back. Took OVER an HOUR to get an order put in for two pairs of glasses!!! We finally leave and get a call at 8 saying the charged us wrong and needed our credit card information to recharge us. After all that we were told they would be ready the next day for pick up. I just called and know they are saying they wouldn’t be ready till after Christmas. So disappointed on how unprofessional this experience was. I expected better with all the other positive reviews.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1544804817991, 'text': 'Hello Daisy Gomez\nWe apologize for all the troubles you have gone through in our store.

Probably one of the worst customer service places called in to see a update for my glasses it’s been 3 weeks .. take them as well if I can replace for a different frame since I need them for work  they said they can but I have to pay them upfront the frames . I told them they didint charge me for my frame all they said is that’s not there problem I will not recommend this place to anyone that want to try them out ..</review>

I showed up early and didn’t have to wait to be seen but the appointment took quite a bit longer than I anticipated. However, the manager was very friendly and accommodating and went out of her way to ensure that I received my glasses the next day.< /Review>

The customer service here was amazing, the team was extremely helpful and the best part is I saved nearly 90$. Got an extra pair of glasses out of it and a free eye exam. Would recommend out of any area in Fresno.<//review>

Very friendly, professional staff; Ruby was super helpful. Late thursday night I made an appointment online for noon on friday, and despite several other people being in the waitimg area I was seen promptly. I would reccommend Stanton Optical on Kings Canyon to anyone.< /review>

Everything went good except, for when i went to the computer and was talking to a heavy set guy with glasses. who tryd to lie and said they only sold 6 months worth contacts when the other lady i spoke to before said they have a 1mnth -3 mnths -6 mnths contacts that i just have to order them. so be careful guys for the light skin heavy set with glasses he trys to make you guys buy high price products and lies about them to make it seem like you have no choice but to buy it.</text>

They hide prices and their promotions are too specific and they will end up either making you buy a pair of glasses or pay 90 for a eye exam you have to take before you know the final price. They just scammed my grandma< /Text>

We came in as a walk in and although they were busy, they still took us and got us out promptly on time. Anna helped us with the exam and was assisting us and 3 other clients at the same time. Nancy helped us get a great deal on 2 glasses for $59 included with the exam. We will be back! Thanks.</text>
