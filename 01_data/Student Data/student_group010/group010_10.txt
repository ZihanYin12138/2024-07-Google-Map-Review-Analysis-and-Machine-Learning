<Review>I would definitely recommend this place for your smog or car repair needs. David who runs the shop is an honest hard working man. He does excellent work and if he feels he won't be able to provide the best service he can he will be point in the direction of someone that can. You really can't be honesty when it comes to finding a good mechanic. Just go down and see for yourself next time you are need of a smog of auto repair<//Review>< pictures>

I don't like to give bad reviews often, but when I call a business to make sure that if I get there at 4:45 that I will still be accommodated, I expect them to keep their word! I got to the business at 4:35 and their doors were already locked. Extremely disappointing considering I had a hard time being able to leave early from work. Luckily there was another star certified smog shop 2 doors down.<//Review>

<text>We walked in on the day our Registration and Smog was due on our vehicle. We were first time customers who found them online with a great coupon. We were taken care of immediately and we were out the door in a flash. Our vehicle passed and we were on our way. We received excellent customer service with a smile! We also Loved that it is a Family friendly business with a great corner for kids to read wonderful stories! We will definitely be back! We will recommend Rancho Smog and Auto Repair to all of our Friends! Thanks for taking great care of us!!!</text>< Pics>

Went here for a brake and light inspection for a salvaged vehicle I bought, came back a little while later on, passed light but failed brake inspection. Upset, but I was happy that Dave let me know what the issue was and took photos and cared about me and my family's safety with this vehicle. I corrected the issue and returned 2 days later. Passed no problem and got to DMV next door with no wait.Dave and his family really worked great with me to make sure I was safe. Thank you again.<//Text>

My dad usually takes my car to go get everything like a smog, oil change, etc. I didn’t know what to expect, but these guys were so helpful and answered all of my questions without making me feel dumb...because I don’t know too much about cars. The smog itself was fast and efficient. I would definitely go back & recommend my friends and family.< /Text>

<Review>This family owned business is awesome!  They worked with me when my older Jaguar would not initially pass Smog Test for 2017 renewal of registration.  They did not charge me at all until the car actually passed smog test.  I will be returning to then for all future vehicle needs. Thank you....<//Review>< Pictures>

Took my car in for a quick 15 minute smog around 1630.  While waiting i went across the street to the DMV.  Came back and was told my car failed due to my catalyst system wasn't ready.  They recommended to drive 100 or 200 miles then come back. I was still told i would have to pay $42 just for failing smog.  It would cost me another $25 for retest plus certificate on my next visit.  I was eager for a retest so i decided to take my car down the street to Nice & Easy smog.  I was greeted by a kind older lady with a friendly smile.  Told them my situation and she recommended i drive about ten miles and come back.  Soon after i returned to the location I was immediately greeted by her with an OBD scanner in hand.  She checked my car if the catalyst was ready and sure enough it was.  My car passed smog right before closing time.  Do yourself a favor and visit Nice & Easy smog instead. Honestly, it was easy like Sunday morning!!  BTW i paid only $40 there and they treated me Family...</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Went here once before and had an ok experience, heard the shop was owned by Christians, I love supporting Christian owned businesses when I can.

So I just called today to ask if they had any availability and was told it was "First come first serve". Fair enough, so I asked if they had customers there right now and if so, how long the wait would be. He responded "yes and I don't know"

He was being really short with me, the guy does this all day long, certainly he should be able to guess.

So I politely tried again, "Do you have an estimate, a guess, of how long it might be?" My wife just got out of the hospital after a c-section, so leaving her home for a long time with two kids isn't exactly an option for me right now.

His response, "I don't know..."

He seemed angry that I called. What's the deal guys? I'll take my business to a place that wants it.< /text>< Pictures>

I'm very sorry you are upset that we told you to move your car or it will be towed. I don't think you would be to happy if we went to you place of work and did something to you where it affects your paycheck.

<name>Julie Murray< /name><time>1612984283900< /time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>Tom and his crew at Anchor Auto Body made the process of having my car repaired very easy for me, once they had the car the worked with my insurance and handled everything.  They kept me updated on the status if repair and when my car would be ready.  After getting car back we noticed something was off when we did the oil change and Tom had me take the car back in and he checked it and even put it on the lift and had us go back with him to see what we were talk8ng about, come to find out the car had been in an accident previously that I was unaware of since I only had car for 3 months. Tom was very helpful and I appreciate him taking the time to show us what was wrong and it had nothing to do with why my car was there to start with. Thank you Anchor Auto Body for such good work and going the extra mile.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>This is probably the best auto body experience I have ever had. Fair prices, quality job, amazing customer experience. I came in on a referral from a long-standing customer and I can now see why my friend recommended them. Please support this family-owned, fabulous small business.

I went in to repair a scuff on the front bumper and replace a windshield on a Dodge Challenger. Alma was my estimator and was so kind, professional and sharp. She gave me a fair estimate and was transparent about the price breakdown. They did not try to overcharge me or upsell me. Customer service was amazing and both jobs were impeccable. They even dropped me off at home and delivered my car (cleaned and vacuumed) to my home upon completion of the services. I received text message updates regarding the job status and estimates, which was just a really nice touch. Anchor also worked with me when I had schedule conflicts and needed to keep the car in the shop for an extra night. It's the little things, ya know?</Review><pics>None< /pics>< user_name>

I had very positive experience with the staff, and also final work came out very nicely.  They kept updating me constantly via emails. AAA referred this shop to fix the front bumper after an accident. When I got the vehicle on time first after fixing, there was a slight misalignment on one side of the bumper. It should have been captured in quality inspection. The staff promptly addressed my concerns.<//Review>

Tom the Manager/Owner is really amazingly helpful. I was just calling around to find a place that can do a specific job, and he was very honest with me about pricing, even had some suggestions of places, and even took a few mjnutes to go over some details explaining how the process works. Im very thankful for him taking the time with me, practically giving me a Free Consultation over the phone, even though he knew I'd be going elsewhere for this kind of job. Now I feel I can move forward more confidently with my decision making. He just sounds like a Good Guy! THANX TOM!<//review>

<review>I always bring my cars to ANCHOR AUTO BODY located in the city of Sunnyvale. They have repaired all my vehicles (6 times) for the past 15 years and have always kept the same quality when it comes to service. Courtesy is a “BIG PLUS“ when it comes to its Customer Service personnel. Now if someone will ask me: which Auto Body shop would you recommend then? I’d say: Try somewhere else so you can regret it forever for not using Anchor Auto Body in Sunnyvale the very first time. A short story: As a Lyft and Uber driver, I picked up this gentleman 4-5 months ago at the Anchor Auto Body shop. He was going back home while his car was serviced. Home was Gilroy (45 minutes away). I couldn’t believe the distance. I have asked him: what brought you so far from home? His answer was this: I always bring all my cars to this body shop regardless of distance. I trust them because they are very professional. You don’t wanna know all the  trouble I had to face several times using other body shops. That’s why  End of story.< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>They rarely told me any news of the car's repairs for 3 weeks or more, and it just lead to me paying for a rental longer than I would have liked. They also didn't really fix anything, even after I issued them photographic proof that the dents etc were not from a previous owner.
I basically paid them to take off the bumpers and put them back on with slightly worse quality tape than last time.<//text>< Pictures>

One of the best experiences I have ever had with an auto body shop.  Clear, direct and on-time.  The work was completed up to my level of understanding and they finished with a detailing.  The customer service by the front office team was just as good.  Thank you to the team for the great experience.  I would recommend this place to anyone!!< /review>

This body shop is a very professional. I was really upset because my coworker hit my car in the parking lot of all places. They offered me some tea, and were very comforting.

What I did not like about them was no communication. I had to call them constantly to find out what was going on with my car.</review>

<review>Their estimator Miguel V is awesome.  He was patient and taught me what needs to be done to fix my car.  He even asked his expert to come out to give an independent second opinion which matched what he originally recommended.  He made some manual adjustments to prove to me what needs to be fixed!! Miguel is obviously an experienced mechanic turned into a great salesman and representative for Anchor Auto Body. At Fremont's "Everything body shop" (where they bragged that they are rated #1) the owner wanted $10,000 to cut and replace.  At another Sunnyvale shop  owned by an Indian - he would not take my tough case.  In contrast Miguel told me that Anchor guarantees their work and gave me the best solution and value!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Fixed my bright orange Fiat 500e and detailed the outside and inside so it looks new. They repaired some damage where they could have ordered new parts, saving on cost. And the quality of the work was top notch and completed in half of their time estimate. Everyone I interacted with was pleasant, intelligent, and treated me with respect. The waiting room is nice and clean with TV and WiFi. I would definitely use them again (but hope I don't have to).</Text><user_id>105325598368066377558< /user_id>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely superb customer service and followup. They met the committed deadline for completion of the body damage repair...and WOW I was amazed at the quality of the work. My car looks new (it is a 1999) and the body repairs, exterior paint were spectacular. I had the owner Tom personally handling my customer service and he took care of the insurance billing. Thank you!!</text>

<response>None< /response><Review>Overall, Anchor did an excellent job repairing my vehicle in a prompt manner once I finally dropped it off. From a customer service perspective, however, they dropped the ball multiple times, and I was very disappointed with them, and I would not go back unless I am able to communicate more clearly with the repair shop.

Anchor is apparently a Mercury-approved repair facility. I was in a rear-end accident which did not require significant work, with no structural damage, and only largely cosmetic damage to my rear bumper. I'd already worked things out with Mercury, who'd accepted liability for the accident, and recommended this shop. I called the shop, who told me to come out, which I did.

They did a quick estimate, and told me that they'd reach out to Mercury to confirm that it was okay to fix my car. I asked if I should leave the car there. They said no. I thought this was odd, but they said that I should't leave my car until Mercury confirmed. This being the end of the day on a Monday, they said they'd email me my estimate tonight (they failed to do that) submit it to Mercury and get back to me the next day (they also failed to do that). So I went back to work, thinking I'd just wasted a lot of time driving out, getting the car looked at, and accomplishing nothing, then going back to work. Mercury happens to call me asking why I haven't dropped off the car. I told them that the shop told me not to, and Mercury says the shop should not have told me that. I'm peeved.

After not hearing anything all day Tuesday, the shop calls me back on Wednesday and let me know Mercury will pay for it after all. I need to go back and drop off the car now. We set up an appointment for Monday.

On the next Monday, I call to say I'm going to drop off the car. They can't seem to remember me for a while, but then discover they haven't ordered parts. I'm glad they told me, otherwise I'd have wasted another trip over there. We set up another appointment for the following Monday.

Finally, the next Monday, I drop off the car, two weeks after the initial estimate. By now I'm rather upset, as this is the third time I've blocked off time on my calendar to go to this shop. I fill out some forms, and they say they'll email with progress. I get zero updates, and finally a voicemail where they say they're finishing up my car a few days later. I can't tell if they're finished from the voicemail, so I have to call them again to confirm it's actually done, not just almost done. Finally, I go pick it up. At least they washed the exterior and vacuumed the interior, though they didn't do a great job, since I have bird poop streaks on my hood still. Guess I'll need another wash.

Long review, mediocre experience. I didn't give fewer stars because the actual car-fixing is what is most important, and that was done rather well. I guess that's something.</Review></record>

<review>Outstanding service. The food is delicious, everything feels fresh and tastes amazing. We always get a delicious meal that also felt like a healthy choice. Also, the manager Herman is so nice and always makes sure that we were having the best experience. This kind of service makes all the difference and it's what makes this one of our favorite spots in the area for a delicious and healthy meal. 100% recommended.</review>< Time>

Luna Grill has the prob the best best chicken kabob, for sure. The rice is super good. I just do double rice instead of salad. The pomegranate lemonade is really good. They have other bottled drinks (i.e mineral bottle water, etc). You get your food like in 13 min or so. Totally chill to go grab a quick lunch or dinner.<//Review>

Phenomenal, are usually go to Luna Grill down the street and order the flat cut chicken kabob. Lately that one has always come out burnt, however this one at Westpark was absolutely delicious! presentation was on point, the chicken was cooked to perfection absolutely perfect. German, the manager was very polite and I gave my compliments to the chef and the cashier who is also very welcoming :)< /text>

My favorite Mediterranean spot in Orange County and I believe food chain! The food is amazingly good healthy and fresh!
The hummus is to die for, And the flat cut chicken is also a must!!!

Pet friendly !!! Gunner (French Bulldog in the picture) loves the chicken here and the staff is very nice always offering water for my puppy.< /Review>

This site is my preferable restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I like it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to visit this place. Whenever  I feel like having a good lunch, this is the place that comes immediately to my head. excellent and varied  food and a large menu.well mannered crew, and agreeable ambience. Not less important, the cost is affordable. I praise this restaurant with no doubt.<//Text>

However, it wasn't the experience I thought it would be: the kale salad had some leftover chicken pieces in it, although I ordered it with falafel, which were completely dry and burnt in oil. The kale was badly chopped with the big stem forgotten in my plate (I found 4) and had lots of yellowish wilted leaves as well. The dressing is not barely enough. The gyro wrap was dry and barely had any meat in it. So disappointed!< /Text>< Pics>

Luna Grill is awesome if you eat out everyday and are looking for a healthy yet satisfying change up. I think the targeted diner is someone who doesn't cook often themselves and wants something healthy. The food is mild and light and tasted neutral and fresh.

The dining room is also nice and clean with ample lighting. This is more of a lunch place and there is a steady stream of people. It was pleasant to sit and eat here. It takes about 10 minutes to get your order.

The sticking point though is the food is good but not great. It's pretty standard and for that I have a hard time giving it more than 3 stars. It was A-OK. The quantity was average. You can get the same quality food in a lot of other places and this place just doesn't stand out enough to garner another star.<//Text>

This place is not a good location. They refused to let me substitute a side for rice. I even offered to pay more money, and was refused. Other locations have let me do this, and I was told that in “Orange County” they do not do that. If you are looking for good customer service, go to a different location.<//Review>

The amount of chicken you get here is not much but overall it’s good. It’s mainly the rice that’ll fill you up. I get their chicken kabob plate with hummus. The chicken tastes fresh and their green spicy hummus is ok.</review>

< review>
This establishment is located in the Market Place. It is in the same building complex as the California Fish Grill and is across the internal parking lot driveway from the movie theater, Pieology, and Sawleaf.

After ordering, one will receive a stand-up tag that one is supposed to place on their table. The patio seating was very windy so it kept falling over due to the wind. (Might want to eat inside next time.)

The food was good. It came out at a medium speed.< /review>

Came in for a quick bite before heading out to a women's volleyball game at UCI.  Place is super clean and very organized.  Staff is very pleasant and courteous.  Food is great and generous portions.

My wife ordered chicken kabab plate that was excellent. Large pieces of chicken breast seasoned perfectly, the salad is fresh and crispy with a hint of citrus, rice was scrumptious. I ended up ordering a cheeseburger (again) with fries (frites, basically).  Just how fries are supposed to be, crispy and brown on the outside and soft on the inside with just the perfect amount of salt.

Food takes a bit of time, but I'm assuming because the food here is made to order? At least it seems that way.  Oh, a BIG PLUS, beer and wine is served here!<//Text>

Great quality food every single time. It gets really crowded & difficult to find parking during lunch so I recommend to get there early. Another option is the online ordering & get your food on the pick up counter directly. I only gave 4 stars due to 1 bad experience w/1 person that I have not seen since then. I was impressed where another young man stepped up & tried to correct the problem. Overall the staff are well versed in what they do. I would recommend this place to others.<//Review>

The food is delicious but did u get a new cook? In the past couple of times that I have been there, the chicken is dry and not enough dressing on the salad. You chicken used to be much juicier. Please do something about it. I really want to come back and for the $15 that I pay, I want it to be worth it.< /text>

<Text>Active Luna Grill fanatic here!

I have the app, I eat at one of the Luna locations almost weekly, and refer to all my friends BUT THIS LOCATION SPECIFICALLY HAS THEEEEEEEEEE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE HANDS DOWN.

Smiles, polite and friendly conversation, orders are out fast- wonderful! wonderful! wonderful!

I'll be back for your fries, flat cut chicken kabob, and greek salads....and gyros....and falafel...okay everything!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dcdc349ce39d27:0x6c08bf9bf7e8f787<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Purchased the deluxe version of the Azure Delight, and it was just amazing!  Delivery was on-time and the recipient was thrilled.  We loved the yellow and blue, and specifically were looking for that combo as the recipient was celebrating her graduation from UCLA.  Thank you Clovis Floral!< /text>

I ordered flowers from Clovis Floral for my wife for our 20th anniversary. The delivery was prompt and the quality of the arrangement was amazing. My wife said her office smelled wonderful all week! Clovis Floral definitely scored me some points.
Thanks Clovis Floral.</Text>

"That’s the biggest most beautiful bouquet I have ever gotten in my whole life!" This is what my friend said after receiving the birthday bouquet I sent her from Clovis Floral. Being a florist myself, I am very picky about where I go for flowers. I grew up in Clovis and I know from years and years of experience, that that is the place to go for fresh, beautiful flowers. Dana, the designer at Clovis Floral reached out to me for a consultation and boy did she ever deliver on her design! She is so talented! 5 Stars to Clovis Floral and 5 stars to Dana their amazing floral designer. Yep! All these years and Clovis Floral still delivers the best and freshest flowers!<//Review>

I called the morning of a funeral and the day after mothers day and she was still able to get me something beautiful and ready before the viewing at 11am and delivered it early to the funeral house.

Best floral experience I have ever had.  Ordered several arrangements a couple of sprays and all were done to my specifications and were absolutely gorgeous.   Staff were super friendly and everyone went out of their way to help me.  Would highly recommend Jeana and Scott for any and all floral needs they will do better than anyone around.    Thanks Clovis Floral you are the best.</Text>

I live in Houston Texas and my family lives in Clovis California it was so nice to have a company that actually delivers what you selected or viewed online
Clovis floral has delivered and provided great service to me......When you are needing a long distance service it’s always hard to know if you get what you paid for and Clovis floral completed their mission perfectly Thank you so much my niece said the flowers were fresh and smelled sooo good . She did take a picture of them when they arrived in like I said they looked exactly like the picture I selected from online great job</text>

Clovis Floral did an amazing job. The sympathy flowers I ordered were beautiful. I had an extremely horrible experience through 1800 Flowers. They failed to deliver my flowers to a funeral and the only way I found out is because I called them 30 minutes after the funeral. I canceled my order and immediately called Clovis Floral and they stepped right up with a beautiful arrangement sent to the family. I couldn't have been pleased. Thanks!<//review>

<text>Really just missed the mark in my mind...

The Good:
Communication was great and the staff was friendly. I also appreciated their willingness to create a custom arrangement on short notice. The delivery was on time as well so points there.

The Bad:
Overall just not close enough to what I had in mind. LOTS of greenery and not very many flowers. If I'm paying by the stem I hope most of those stems are flowers. Also, the card... very disappointed with the personalized message card. A cut out piece of paper stapled to the inside of a blank card with a typed out message in small, very standard font is just not good enough for $100 arrangement.

Overall - the process was great, no real complaints. The final product, however -- underwhelming and overpriced in my opinion.

(but hey, maybe I'm just too picky. Here's the arrangement. You decide)<//text>< user_name>

I have been searching for a good selection of houseplants. I live in Hanford, but work in Clovis. I just happened to turn down a different road to get back to the office, and saw this cute little shop. I stopped in and was in plant heaven. It's just a quaint little shop and was a peaceful place to spend some of my lunch hour. I was helped by two employees and they were very knowledgeable about their products. Cost is higher than a big chain store, but quality is better and worth it for me to shop local as much as possible. I will be a new regular customer!< /review>

This is a small shop in the heart of downtown Clovis that did everything possible to put together a wonderful arrangement very quickly. I got to pick out the flowers and they even texted a pic before it was delivered! Not to mention that it smells heavenly in the shop! Very reasonably priced.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I never leave reviews but I just had to today. In March, we had my in-laws funeral. We used Clovis Floral for the flowers. We purchased two stand sprays and two casket sprays. I thought the flowers were nicely done. We spent $1,000 for those four floral arrangements. We used the stands for the funeral on a Saturday and took them to the graveside on Monday. We kept the stands wet but the floral arrangements did not even make it the two days. The flowers were wilted and the stands looked sad. We used them anyway. I vowed not to use Clovis Floral again. We had my funeral for my grandson today. The funeral home recommended Clovis Floral again, and against my better judgement, we went with them. We ordered a small arrangement for the top of the casket. We paid $150 for the arrangement. It was smaller than I expected but it was nicely done. I’m including a picture of the floral arrangement, if I can. The problem is they were late for the delivery. We made arrangements for the flowers to be delivered at 8:00am. We confirmed the date with the florist before we left the florist 5 days before the funeral. She put the wrong date in the system. The funeral was supposed to start at 9:00am. At 9:08, I called the floral shop to find out where the arrangement was. They said there was a misunderstanding. I asked what the misunderstanding was because it seemed pretty clear to me what was supposed to happen. They apologized and said it was on its way. It got there at 9:20. We delayed the service until we had the flowers there. We had 50 people there waiting to start. I just felt we couldn’t start without flowers. Its a sad day and the last thing grieving parents should be waiting for are their flowers. I will never use this florist again.</Text>< pictures>

{'time': 1602704216831, 'text': "Hello Robb, thank you for letting us know how to improve our business.  We have no excuse for the delay at the funeral.  Our clerk evidently entered the wrong info when she took the order.  In hindsight, we should have verified the time of service with the funeral home, which we will do as a double check in the future.  We have also taken other precautionary measures to insure this won't happen again.  We are so sorry you had to delay the service 20min to wait for flowers.   I know it's not about the $ but we have already refunded the total order of $118.19.  There are no words to express how upset everyone here is, including the clerk, for this mishap.  We appreciate you and  even your review and are sending our prayers to you and your family during this difficult time."}<//response>

Real Compassion & understanding are vital during this pandemic.  There are no words to describe the pain one suffers after losing a family member and being unable to be with those suffering most.  I'm in Florida and my daughter & son-in-law are in Fresno. They just lost their unborn daughter of 7 months. My husband & I both fall into vulnerable categories and are unable to be there to bring personal comfort to them or attend the funeral.  To say that this is traumatic is an understatement.

After hearing my situation, Clovis Floral & Cafe was extremely compassionate and "in tune" during my call to them. I wanted a flowering plant.  They tailored my order exactly (by sending me pics for approval, choices,  etc.,)   Thank you so much Clovis Floral & Cafe.  Hopefully my daughter can plant those absolutely gorgeous pink azaleas in her yard in memory of our Angel Baby "Lydia".  Thanks for "being there" when we couldn't be.</Text>

We love Clovis Floral! My husband always orders flowers for Mother’s Day and birthdays, and they are beautiful, reliable, and friendly. I just placed a last-minute delivery order and they were able to do it no problem. Having gotten to know the owners, they are good people that I want to support. We so appreciate Clovis Floral!<//review>

< Review>
So every man needs a florist. And from the minute I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile. I told the florist what I wanted and what it was for and she helped me pick exactly what I wanted. My wife was happy and so was I. When looking for flowers I wanted to stay local and give my business to someone in Clovis. I am so happy I did. The price was reasonable, and they accommodated all of my needs (an afternoon delivery by river park next day) thank you clovis floral for helping me show my appreciation to my wife on our anniversary. I will be returning. Remember shop local clovis.< /Review>

Last minute phone order from Scotland! It's Christmas Eve and I forgot to place an order for my father in Fresno for his Christmas gift. The  owner was fantastic - he delayed his own finishing time to be with his family, so that my elderly father could have his gift and message. Thank you so much!! Clovis Floral has been and will continue to be my contact for flowers and gifts over the years.<//review>

I went to Clovis Floral $ Cafe in search for a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend. After a short flower consultation with one of the owners I had picked an assortment of beautiful, fresh flowers. After picking the flowers and a vase she went into the back to prepare the bouquet. She emerged about 10 minutes later with an ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL valentines bouquet. Clovis Floral & Cafe provided completely outstanding customer service. I would highly suggest that if you want to get the perfect assortment of flowers for to go here! You wont regret it, I sure didn't!<//Review>

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I don’t write reviews often, but they deserve it! They’re very accommodating, helpful, and sweet! She took the time to call me because she realized I was having it delievered to my house. I explained that we were having my brothers memorial at the lake the next day. She put it on a lower stand for me so that I wouldn’t have any problems with it falling over (which I didn’t). They delievered it to me as late as they could so that it could still be fresh an beautiful for the next day. They also took the time to show me how to take care of it. It was a very beautiful arrangement, even the day after it still looked just as beautiful. Truly is a wonderfully owned floral shop! I wish I could attach a picture.<//Text>

She took the time to call me because she realized I was having it delievered to my house. I explained that we were having my brothers memorial at the lake the next day. She put it on a lower stand for me so that I wouldn’t have any problems with it falling over (which I didn’t). They delievered it to me as late as they could so that it could still be fresh an beautiful for the next day. They also took the time to show me how to take care of it. It was a very beautiful arrangement, even the day after it still looked just as beautiful. Truly is a wonderfully owned floral shop! I wish I could attach a picture.< /Text>

Decided to send a good friend some flowers and call the local store in Clovis, being that I am from Los Angeles.  I didn't want to call one of the big chain florists. I spoke with Elizabeth and she was so helpful.  She actually Facetime-ed me and I got to see all the beautiful plants in the store.  Wow, so happy I called and ordered from Clovis Floral.  Thank you again Elizabeth, I know our friends will love this heart shaped plant.  You made it so easy and the store has an amazing variety to choose from.  So creative and fun!!!!<//Text>

I wanted to send flowers to my boyfriend's mom for Mother's Day and it was so easy to order online with Clovis Floral and Cafe. Their website was very user friendly and they had a great selection of arrangements for every budget. My boyfriend's mom loved her flowers and I think their work is great! Delivery was quick and professional.</text>

Talk about customer service. I can tell they really care about their customers. Gina went above and beyond to make my gift basket and get it delivered on time. It was amazing and my recipient was impressed too. Thank you Clovis Floral for the personal service. You're a great family owned shop and perfect for Old Town. I recommend everyone to stop by when they're in the area. There's so much more than flowers too!< /review>

<Review>I have never purchased flowers from Clovis Floral before. I heard it was under new ownership so I gave them a try. They came through with flying colors. Outstanding service, listened to my request and came through on two special orders the same day. Great job and super nice people. They even set up an account for me with no hassle; couldn't be easier.  I will definitely return.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<text>My boyfriend purchased a bouquet of roses online which contracted with Clovis Floral. I can't believe the lack of quality and time that was put into my order. The roses that were delivered appeared as if they were put together by a preschooler. To top it all off, the florist called me directly, when it was supposed to be a "surprise". Do not pay for expedited delivery! Early delivery, means you will get your delivery after lunch time (or when it is convenient for them). After seeing what the bouquet was supposed to look like, and looking at what was delivered, it have the utmost disappointment in Clovis Floral. What a waste of $100 when Costco would have provided a better bouquet for a fraction of the price.</text>< Time>

After letting the owners know of my dissatisfaction with the flower arrangement I had ordered, they went out of their way to make things right. That is something I can definitely appreciate. No person or shop is perfect, but when they do everything they can to remedy a situation, well there's something to be said for that. I will be returning to this shop in the future.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x80945c83f39d94ed:0x7dcac86b7bacc147</gmap_id>< time>

Lady I spoke to on the phone was the rudest person I've ever spoken to! She had attitude and was very caddy! I will NEVER give this flower shop business again. I regret staying on the phone and  completing the order, but I was on lunch and short on time.  Arrangement was just ok, nothing to 'wow' about it. Looked very plain and thrown together.  I've never written a review about any business but the way the lady on the phone helped me left me very disappointed.< /text>

<Review>I am so disappointed when I called the order in on Monday the gentleman that took the order was obviously in a hurry but I got the order in gave him my credit card and told him it was a school. This morning at 11:30 James called and said my credit card did not go through. I returned the call at 12:30 to someone who could barely speak english...well at least she got my credit card number right. I told her it was a school and my daughter is gone by 3:00! The flowers were delivered at 4:00 THANKS FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I WILL TELL EVERYONE NOT TO USE YOU! YOU WASTED MY MONEY AND MY TIME. To give you one star is one too many!  What you did was crappy, unthoughtful, uncaring and stealing in my book

<Text>If you get a bad pizza here it's your own fault. You pick the crust, you pick the sauce, you pick the toppings. We can never agree on what to put on a pizza, so this works perfect for the two of us. I like lots of veggies, she likes the standard toppings and we both leave happy.

Not bad for a chain joint.<//Text><time>1609307351190<//time><user_name>Mark Y</user_name>< UserId.>

How can a pizza "restaurant" run out of cheese. At least change the sign on your door from "Temporarily Closed, Please Wait Outside" to something like "We're Closed, Out Milking A Cow To Make You Fresh Mozzarella Cheese"

What a find!! I have been missing PizzaRev which closed it's Santa Barbara location last year, due to pre existing management issued quadrupled by the pandemic.

Tried blaze for the first time today due to a pie day offer.  Make your own pizza for $3.14.

I like my pizza loaded with everything - combination of spicy red and pesto sauce, mozerella, gorgonzola, feta, goat cheese,  chicken, olives, bell peppers, onions, spinach, red peppers, jalapeno, basil, roasted garlic topped with pesto butter. Well done to handle the weight of all these toppings.

It tasted great!</text>

Not many options in town for vegan pizzas but this place is nice. Vegan cheese, vegan chicken and soyrizo. Such a great spot. Lots of hand sanitizer, indoor dining when I went but very safe with the tables properly distanced. One of my favorite places to eat in town.< /Review>

Fun place. Fast casual dining, where the pizzas are made right in front of you and you can customize any way you like. Sort of feels like a pizza version of the Chipotle model.<//text>

Great pizza ready fast. Build Your Own (unlimited toppings) is an AMAZING deal for a pizza good for 2 meals (if you're disciplined enough - it's hard to stop eating something so yummy). 3 types of dough, many sauce choices, and so many available toppings. I highly recommend!</Review>

$8.25 for an unlimited topping pizza. Or get a signature pizza.  Choose from a wide variety of sauces, cheese, meats, veggies and flavorful toppings. For a crunchy crusty try pesto sauce on the edge of the crust. Then have them drizzle either pesto, balsamic, or oil on top. You can make a salad too. Grab a soft drink or a beer on tap. Delicious cookies, brownies and s'more pie. Give it a try.<//Review>

A new place pizza on broadway and it does not disappoint. They have really cute decor inside and love the big fire brick oven that you can see exactly your pizza bing made. They are really quick at getting it to you. I ordered the prosciutto and pork pizza to go and they were fantastic. Very well made. They only two negatives are you, you have to come in and place the order to go and that the pizza on gets a little too burned. Otherwise I'll be back here again.<//Review>

I got half a pizza with a salad for $8.95.  You can add as many toppings as you like.  It was light and really good. It was a relaxing atmosphere. The customer service was awesome.< /text>

I know the employees who work on State Street so I'm hoping it's not from there (usually its picked up from whichever location is closest so I don't really know) but honestly it needs to be know. The pizza was actually undercooked. The dough was gooey, sticky and barely cooked on the bottom. I could actually peel off the whole top half of the pizza from the base. The cheese was greasy, the pepperoni was dry and the crust was semi-burnt. I hope this was the Goleta location's doing, and it was just sent through the wrong store.

I had a awesome experience here today! I went on my lunch break and didn't have to wait long even though there was a few people in line ahead of me, the two ladies Twyla and meranda worked hard and still we're having fun with customers still being quick and everyone through the line quickly! This has been the best experience I have had yet at blaze and hope either one of them help me next time. I can tell they really enjoy interacting with customers and putting smiles on faces! Now on to the pizza Twyla made sure to spread all the topping I wanted evenly around so I'd get a little bit of everything in each bite without over loading it and it being a mountain like most other times I've been here. The crust wasn't burnt as I asked for her to watch it and cook it how she would like it. It was just a over all amazing time today with awesome pizza for lunch! Thanks twyla!<//Review>

Im not a fan of thin crust pizza BUT this was FANTASTIC! Just the right amount of crust, sauce and toppings. I got an 11" build your own with pepperoni, Italian sausage and banana peppers delivered through Door Dash. The timing was perfect to quell my hunger. I'm a flight attendant and the ease of ordering and delivery definitely makes me want to get another next time in I'm Santa Barbara.</Review>

Pizza is decent. The old guy here is a little unprofessional. Didn't appreciate him scooping up sauce from the counter with his clean gloves then slopping it back into the sauce pan. Bizzarre and grotesque< /text>

<Date>1554961444715<//Date><review>Today was my 1st visit to blaze pizza. I went in with the intent of just getting something small like a lemonade or a side salad, that is until I was greeted by a tall friendly woman with short blonde hair and glasses who talked me through the menu. I wish I had gotten her name because she definitely deserves individual recognition for her excellent service. I opted for the most popular build your own option and she was so patient with me as I chose topping after topping to create my delicious concoction. The pizza was pure perfection with a small side of ranch to tie it all together. I will definitely be returning!</review>< pictures>

A quick and reasonably priced meal. The service is great, everyone is very friendly. The pizza itself is lacking, the pie crust is nothing special; the sauces, cheese & topping options are plenty and what you would expect; they do serve alcohol and 100% cane sugar soda very tasty.</review>

Great as usual. Really nice. She made sure to change gloves, cleaned off the dough press and gave me the sauce that had no gluten touching it at any time. I didn't have any problems after eating that night or the next day! With severe allergies it can be tricky. Love this place. I have liked all of the locations I have gone to.</text>

This is my first time at the one in Santa Barbara and I got a build your own masterpiece 🍕 and they seem to be a little stingy with the toppings I had to ask for things like a little more cheese cause there where large open areas where you could see through to the sauce and a little bit more mushrooms etc.. and when the older grey hair guy who was putting the pizzas into the  oven seen the amount of toppings on the pizzas I had ordered he seemed to get mad at his employees for adding a lil extra cheese and veggies I have never experienced that with the one in Oxnard, so anyway I spent well over $50 with them so it shouldn't have been a problem😏< /text>

By far Blaze Pizza from me anyhow and for the price is a Five Star Pizza restaurant has cozy little tables to sit down a variety of different beverages and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, also you can't go wrong with the price for the pizza $8 in change and you can put on as many toppings and as much toppings as you can possibly think of and any combination of toppings peaches are all the same size and it's good for two people but I always ordered two pizzas because one just not enough that's how good they are at least to me. So all those individuals that are looking for a good pizza place to go to for the right price and as many toppings as you can possibly handle and go to Blazing Pizza you won't be sorry but that's my opinion you have to be the judge yourself.<//text>

You choose your toppings as you move down the line, and the counter person puts them on your pizza as you go. There's no limit to the number of toppings; the build your own pizza option comes at a single low price, regardless of how many toppings you choose.  (I don't really see the advantage of the predesigned "signature" pizzas.) The pizza comes in only one size, but you can order half a pizza if you want. The crust is amazingly thin, and comes out delightfully crisp. All in all, this is one of the best pizzas around.<//Text>

They skimp on toppings and throw out huge pieces of dough. It's not tasty enough to go back. Not sure if the people working there are unhappy or just not into working, but the only employee who interacts is the young man on the oven.<//Text>

I had originally posted a 5 star review on this pizza place but my son informed me that when he was ordering his pizza at a football fundraiser that he asked for cilantro and was told "We are not mexican we dont have cilantro here"... Not only Mexicans use cilantro but anyone of any race can use and like any herb or toppings as they please. I think some employee training is needed. If i would have heard that slick comment or he wouldve told me that moment then we wouldve all walked out (40 people maybe more) and gave our business to a Mexican place or just somewhere else(reminder this was a fundraiser for A football team of mixed races, american, African American,  hispanic, every race). Dont let a ignorant employee make you lose business.< /Review>

I'm a frequent customer. This last time I came in, the restaurant was empty, save for maybe two people seated and already eating. Despite it looking deceivingly slow, we still waited obscenely long for someone to wait on us and for our pizzas to be made. It appeared as if there were some online orders that were gumming up the works but it really seemed to me that they just hadn't figured out an efficient way to handle orders coming in at the same time as in-store customers. Alas, I got the short end of the stick. I will just go to the IV location from now on (or -gasp!- Pieology).< /text>

Bestest ever, in all the land!!! I'd actually go outta my way & wait a little longer to get the best, rather than go elsewhere to get the standard okie-doke one!  If you like perfect crust pizza & fresh to order toppings than you better give Blaze Pizza a try because you won't ever need to think about where your getting your next pizza at again!< /Review>

The staff were nice. The choices of toppings are ssso delicious. The pizza? Record breaking fast. Every thing was incredibly fresh! We had the Meat Eater, topped it with bacon and it's like the best gourmet pizza ever. 5 stars!!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Great pizza but staff can be rude. Pushed to online ordering which results in food being ready at incorrect times. Lompoc Blaze does not pick up their phone or accept phone orders so use a pc before you get in the car.<//text>

The worst customer service, my first visit and probably my last. Ordered online through their app, was charged but when I arrived the lady that could hardly speak or understand, all Hispanic staff with language barriers. If this place survives it's because they sell drugs out of the I.V location, probably here as well. I will never return to blaze pizza and I haven't even had a bite. If it we're possible I'd give them a -5*</Text>

<Review>This pizza was missing the essential element. The pizza sauce. I dont know if the young girl who helped was new (had a bandaid on her neck), but she forgot to put the sauce directly onto the pizza before putting on the cheese and other ways of assembling a pizza. I'm not aware if this is how the veg out pizza is supposed to be made, but I asked her if I could get the pizza sauce on the pizza, like how it is supposed to, and she said that it comes on top. That I was aware of. I didn't want to cause her any hassle to make a new one, but I hope she and other employees, even while it's slow, remember to put on the essential ingredient to a pizza...the sauce. 2 stars for preparation.

I apologize for the review, "just dont eat the pizza and that's it". But, I've been working in food service since I was 16. I'm just reviewing this as a reminder for employees to pay attention to their job and cleanliness.

Edit : One stars. Just found a hair in my pizza.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Manager is terrible! There was a mistake on our pizza, no big deal, but while inquiring about the mix up I asked for a refund or gift card and that we could wait a few minutes until the line died down, and the Manager said, “Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh” - totally dismissive and disrespectful. 5 minutes later he brought me a cash refund. Then 5 minutes later asked if we wanted the mistake pizza. We said sure, and then he said he was going to wait another few minutes for someone to show up. I then watched him try to give it to another table as their order got screwed up too. We never got the pizza he offered. Beyond awful service, from a manager none the less.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80e9152519f31d45:0xef94ac7f17dfbeb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ok for the price. It is not worth getting anything beyond the basic pizza choice because the extra toppings are sparse and not very interesting.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I can put everything I want to my pizza and the combination of half pizza and salad for less than $ 10 is perfect.
They also have the option that the base is cauliflower.

<UserId.>108892941192854740714</UserId.><Text>Picture is fake its very run down.Wow 1 star is over justice. I would have left 0 if possible. Used the "car wash" today. First off ghetto buttons don't read what each click means then neither soaps work. I try 2 time spending $3.00 in total. I politely talk to the gentleman and explain i would like reimbursement  for the money I spent since it did not work. Then he makes up tons of excuses saying I didn't check the soap today, maybe the soap pump is not working. Then he says what do you want me to do i said politely again please reimburse me. He gets even more agitated and says it has to come out of my pocket then slams $3.00 on the counter! I took it threw it in his face f*** you! Never never ever ever going here again horrible condition and customer service!!!! Buy here at your own risk...

< review>
Very disrespectful to my mother over her telling them that soap was not coming out of the brush for the self wash car wash. Paid 3.00$ for just water? Could've just did that at home. Never going back. Run down anyways. Valero and 76 can take my money instead.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>This place is nice and peaceful!! The manger Tammy takes pride in the up kept of each room and goes out of her way to make sure you are comfortable! Also she has Put in lot of Love ‘working the wonderful garden they have. It was so nice to sit in early in the morning and drink a cup coffee bird singing. The rooms have all been remodeled in the last about 6 months or so.  If you just need a place to rest your head good place for that. If you need a place to clear your mind and relax perfect place for that. If you need some Alone time you and your lady special time Great place for that! It might be out away from everything but that is what I like about it the have their own little Desert paradise I can’t wait to see when They get completely done with the up grades with the place look forward to come back!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80eaf79ffadf6ac5:0xc2f6cce2ed587362</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've never stayed here but I have slept in the parking lot. It's right off the highway for a quick escape if the motel manager starts throwing rocks at your car.</Text>

Famoso Motel has new owners !
Best thing that’s happened here in a long time.
The Gill family’s experience in trucking has brought about many changes.
The stores entire interior soon will have a updated clean organized look.
New diesel pumps are soon going in to better serve the big trucks.
Gone will be the restaurant to make way for truck parking and create a open feel.
Changes In the Motel will soon include an office with night window as well as updating of the rooms.
So come in meet the new owners then check back in to see all the changes!!</Text>

The only good thing about this place is the manager Tammy. She will go out of her way to do what she can for you. The Owners are the Worst. They don't care about the hotel or it's customer's. They only care about the gas station that they want to turn into a truck stop. There very rude to people an when 1 if them got sick he still would work the counter.</Review>

Best hamburger I have had in a while! I ordered the E street burger per the picture. Highly recommended place. Will come back for sure!  Don't let the area or outside fool you. Super friendly service, vibe and priced well for what you get! Keep it up guys!<//Text>

If I could give it 10 stars I would. From the cleanness to the amazing service to the fire delicious food nothing at all to complain about. Even the pricing was wow due to the the quality the food has. Everyone was super sweet and attentive. Definitely will go there again this week.</Review>

Great place to pickup an excellent breakfast or lunch! Creative menu! Lots of comfort foods AND healthy choices! Fruit cup was freshly made with several types of berries, oranges, and apple. Friendly staff! Worth making the trip to Chinatown!<//Review>

<Review>They serve the best burgers. My husband found this place and I was a little Skeptical about the area but decided to try it anyways. We are now regulars and definitely recommend this place. The owner is super nice and Tuesdays are customer appreciation day you get cookies 🧡.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Stopped in Fresno for breakfast after our trip to Yosemite. Don’t let the exterior be the judge of the 5 star customer service and food this place serves. Absolutely amazing- tried the breakfast crunch wrap but even more fantastic was the banana fosters french toast. Willing to say the BEST French toast I’ve ever tasted. Absolute must try!!!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Order at the counter and then they bring it to you. Outdoor seating was perfect today!  This place is locally owned and the owner is soooo friendly and really cares about the quality of his food - and it shows! We will be back very soon! They are waiting for a liquor license so hopefully they'll also be able to serve beer and wine soon!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>The food was superb with an excellent variety of options.  I wish I had ordered the daily chicken sandwich special because the person got it next to my table and everyone with me was drooling! It was a HUGE piece of crispy chicken with pickle and Mayo that puts Popeye's new famous chicken sandwich to shame.< /review>< Pics>

Jumping on the Tulare Street Bistro wagon! I rarely give 5s but my Sis referred me and swears by this establishment. I went by and tried them out. I did breakfast for lunch and went with the Philly Cheesesteak. It was DELICIOUS but even more so, the love that it was served with meant even more. Great friendly staff, wonderful ambiance (they had nice jazz playing), and true care for their guests. I love this place just like my Sis. They serve with seasoned steak fries and the steak has flavor. Well done TSB! Thanks for taking a chance with us on the West Side and bringing quality dining. Your gumbo and Jalapeño grits are both on the radar for future visits! 👏< /Text>

Tried this spot for the first time recently, for a quick breakfast. I ordered the Breakfast Crunchwrap with jalapeños and it was fantastic. I could only eat half, as the portion was huge, so I saved the rest for later. Friendly staff as well! They're currently open for pickup/takeout, I believe.<//review>

<Text>I have been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks and have tried something different each time. I have to say the food is on point, I found a diamond in the ruff. When you are tired of the same thing day in and day out give this place a shot you won't be disappointed.</Text>< user_id>

Stopped in on our way from Sacramento to LA for some lunch. I got the Philly cheese steak with grilled onions and my husband got the Cuban panini (which I had to try a bite of). Well seasoned, perfect portions, awesome food. The mushroom flavor in the cheese steak permeated the sandwich. The pork on the Cuban was moist and juicy. Delicious! Definitely stopping by again on our next trip through fresno!</review>

<text>We ordered the breakfast crunchwrap and huevos rancheros. Wait about 15 mins for our orders. The breakfast crunchwrap was a good size very filling, it had potatoes, cheese, eggs and sausage. The huevos rancheros included a side of country potatoes which was so good, there was a crunch on the outside.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Food, it’s so pretty you don’t want to take a bite outta it.  But..,  when you do, you just can’t put it down !
Always fresh.  Always high quality , from the sandwiches, to the salads and breakfasts.

These guys are great. My first trip there I was greeted with a warm welcome and high level of professionalism. The team and highly skilled and did a great job on my car. They even saved my car from potential paint damage they had noticed and fixed for me. I highly recommend Whittier car Wash!!< /text>

<Review>Looks like a family owned business. I see the owner walking around, double checking to make sure the cars look good. There is seating  inside and outside. It can take a while to get your car washed here but worth it. They have a good coffee shop inside too.</Review><Response>None< /Response><Time>1526415919166<//Time>< GmapID>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I always come here, usually spending 30-70 dollars and I always tip well. I don't know if the Asian gentleman was the owner or not but he was very disrespectful and rude to me. He did not clean my car correctly and when I tried to correct him nicely he proceeded to scream and cuss at me in front of my autistic child. I was not yelling at him nor was I being confrontational and I don't think I deserved to be yelled at and treated like this especially in front of my child. An older man should never yell at a woman in front of her child like that. I don't plan on supporting this man's business again. I did provide a tip.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Solid place for a car wash. A bit pricey, and it's a bit of a wait (due to high customer volume). The machine applies the soap, and rinses the car, but the scrubbing is done by hand. My only complaint is that the scrubbing isn't all that well done. They just lightly pass the towel over with the soap. This isnt enough to get the bird poop off of my car. Sometimes, when I leave, there's are small bits of poop of my car that they missed. For $35, I expect all bird poop gone.< /Review>

Pricey for sure. Typically I wash my own car, but I thought I would try this place. Music blasting was a turn off. Witnessed an employee driving a vehicle through the bay and bumping the car in front it. Why? There was plenty of room for him to wait. My Car was clean, but this place is weird.Not coming back.< /Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Just left the car wash, and am extremely saddened by what I saw. I observed an employee mess up a vehicle and didn't correctly clean it, and the woman approached the employee as nicely as possible and the man proceeded to yell expletives at her and told her to leave the establishment when all she asked for was the man to redo the car. She was being very respectful and the man was very rude and disrespectful towards her and in front of her young child nonetheless. If this is a regular occurrence, I don't think I will be visiting this establishment anymore< /text>< pictures>

Bad customer service from the owner, Lee, Asian man, the rest of the stuff (all the other workers) were very nice, but this man was very, very rude. Poor customer service, from this man,  from the beginning. I asked for a regular service and he was very rude. Also, since I told him that he was rude, he kept my car until the end and other car after me, were all gone and I was the last one to be served! Lee< /review>

<text>After coming back after over a year due to pandemic, I can only say I was sad to see the prices go up quite a bit.  My go-to was the Super Wash, but it has gone up.  Now the café at that time, was loud with Reggaeton music.  It is not easy to hear the workers during a transaction over the music.  For snacks, you buy your snacks (chips or cookies) at one register and drinks at another.🤦🏻‍♀️  I cannot complain about the cleaning of the car, which is the main reason I was here. Hehehe.</text></record>

<review>I've been coming here for a few years. I was there today and there was still trash that was left in my console but even worse there was still soap in the back of my truck. They don't even try to rinse it out before they bring it out to dry. I saw someone trying to use the air hose to get it out but when I went to leave there was still the green soap that they use in the back. I might not be back. I do a better job myself at the self serve places</review><rating>2<//rating><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Darren Hamada</Name>< response>

Their careless Employee Edgar moved my car into wash area after being vacuumed and rear ended vehicle. A Landrover, that was parked in front. With a witness right there that saw it happen.
NOW, what was upsetting was that Manager called me and witness, Liars Total Unprofessional !!!
Employee Edgar vanished for lunch Conveniently . NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN...</Review>

It's an okay Car wash. Would not want to go to it again if I'm honest. If you get Super Wash (like I did for my Hummer H3) It seemed like I got the basic wash. My floors were not vacuumed good, my insides were still very dusty, didnt look like they did any cleaning on the inside.
I felt like I was better off cleaning and vacuuming it myself and just having them do the outside next time.<//Text>

Avoid the taco shop here! You walk in and the music is blasting so loud that you literally have to yell to be heard. I asked if they could lower the music and I was ignored. They don't carry rice or beans and kept on insisting that I will like the burrito the way they make it. I'm sorry, but I know what I like to eat and not the way someone wants me to eat it.</Review>

I purchased the 31 dollar wash...The first time I'd say it was 5 stars.  The guy was very detail oriented and he took his time.....This last time there didn't seem to be as much effort put into it and the guy was a lot quicker...
So from 5 stars to 3 stars....I was dissatisfied this time...<//Review>

Such a beautiful place they have turtles a cat they sell tacos massage chairs all available to look at or enjoy while they wash the car. The car washers don't go out of their way to vacuum , but the positive vibes that are present there make up for it.< /Text>

Cashier was friendly. Only reason for 2 stars. The wash was $24.99 + $3 more for a truck. I was disappointed because they charge $3 more for the truck but the bed was full of soap before I left. Had to ask the guy to wipe down. This is second time something like this happened last time bed was full of muddy shoe prints.  Seriously considering going somewhere else. For $3 more I expect things done right.</Review>

The new owner of this car wash seems more concerned with his profits by continually raising prices rather than building good will with his long term customers.

As a result of the price increases, I now go to the car wash once per month rather than every other week as I did for the previous 15 years so he is only getting half the business he used to from me.

The new owner also doesn’t allow you to get a stamp on your car wash card if you are using a coupon sending another clear message that profit is more important to him than return business.</Text>

<Text>Very disappointing I thought they would at least get the car cleaner than I could with my hose and no soap.

Paid for the most expensive wash they have (diamond I think) for my wife’s car. After we had picked the wash, scent etc the guy told us their card machine doesn’t work so cash only. I said fine and went to get cash to cover the $35 wash and a tip. Get back and still waiting for my wife’s car for about 15 min.

Get out to the car and there are still spots on the car (white car brown spots). So I point them out to the worker and he starts scrapping at it with his thumb nail so I point out some more and he wipes them with a dirty rag.

Finally I just gave him the plastic claim check and left. When I get home I notice there are still finger prints on the windows and even more spots that I didn’t notice at the car wash.</Text></record></dataset><record>

We took our Car and truck both in, one for a wash and one for a complete detail. They seemed to do a perfectly fine job on both, no complaints. Rather expensive, but we haven't compared to other places, so could just be the going rate.</text>

Convenient and close to home.  Price is about average. Good hour's. They did a good job cleaning and drying. Just some spots here and there missed. But other than that no biggie.  Would l go back a third time? Yes I would.< /Text>

<Review>I don't often post 1 star reviews but I had to this time for several reasons: 1. I waited over 45 min for my car just to be vacuumed.  2. The place is run down inside with no coffee or water for the guests waiting.  3.  After I my car was washed it was still dirty (streaks on the windows and carpets still needed vacuuming).  I requested them to run it through again and was told I would have to pay again.  Sorry yo.... but that was it I left and I don't think I'll ever return.< /Review>< pictures>

DO NOT get a interior detail from this place! The car was still dirty & not properly wiped down on the inside . I was waiting for almost three hours & when I went to go check on my car the guy was sitting down on his phone . Please save your money & go elsewhere!< /Review>

You can tell they never wiped down or dried my mirrors or my entire back window because they were severely spotted still from the dried water. Also, I asked for cherry air freshener and my car had absolutely no scent at all (aside from the cleaning products).
Just wish they had dome a better job, I usually like this car wash.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I have always been satisfied with the work they do at this car wash. They always seem to take the time to make sure that your car is clean. And if I see something they missed. They always take care of it on the spot.< /review>

There's a sign that says "Do Not leave valuables in vehicle". I strongly recommend you heed the warning! Reasonably priced for a car wash.< /Review>

<name>Jodye Selco<//name><Review>First they charge me extra for having an SUV (I have a Prius C - the small hatchback). When I complained they tried to justify this as needing to clean the roof of the car. Then they gave me a "basic" car wash despite paying for an upgraded "super wash". When I complained, they did not want to run the car back through to make sure it was waxed. What a ripoff!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<rating>1</rating><text>They used to be great. I took my truck and my wife's car every week for years.  However, over the past couple of months the quality is lousy.  I paid for a detail and they just waxed over water spots rather than cleaning them off first.  To top it off they now have a policy that they won't re wash it if you leave the lot and notice issues.  I'm taking my business elsewhere from now on.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>My car was on the tracks of this car wash, when my car was ready to be taken off neutral by an active employee- to be driven to the front lot where they dry & clean the windows, No one was there! So what happened? A truck behind me that was next to be off the tracks hits my rear end bumper & with his license plates makes a dent. We tried talking to the asian owner but he was so rude & careless. The truck owner was the witness and saw what happened but the asian owner could care a less. I called the police but they stated that because it wasn't a huge collision & no one got hurt that they couldn't arrive at the scene to make a report. The truck owner asked for the car wash owners insurance but he declined to give up the information. We ended up exchanging our insurance information, the car wash asian owner didn't offer an apology Nor refunded us our car wash money Back for the inconveniences. After the truck owner left the asian owner came to me telling me that he would fix my rear bumper under handedly but he didn't want me to call my insurance company. He stated that he didn't offer that to the gentleman with the truck because he was arguing with him & nothing happened to his truck, that he was just exaggerating! I can tell you that it wasn't true, the truck owner was trying to get this resolved because all this collision happened while our cars were under their responsibility. WATCH YOUR CARS @ THIS CAR WASH LOT OR EVEN GO TO ANOTHER ONE WHERE THEY OFFER POSITIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The asian owner even told me that he doesn't offer money back only gives you a free car wash for next time WOW! 0 STARS....<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>very poor quality wash, once I got home had to wipe down entire car for water spotting. Bugs left on headlights, front end, and grill, and for some reason had ashtray full of liquid.  Suggest you wash car yourself , and eliminate the middleman because you will be spending time finishing what you pay them to do</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Chose to visit this car was today instead of my normal one because it says that the hours of operation are 7:30am and my entire family has been getting their car washed here for years. I sat in my car watching numerous employees walk by, none coming to speak to me. Here it was 7:47am and I finally got out of my car to ask someone if something was wrong and this young girl with glasses with probably the worst customer service I’ve ever seen in my entire life told me “we open at 8am”. I simply asked why it says 7:30 online did management change the hours? To which her response was “I don’t really care I just know I’m not on the clock until 8” and continued to walk inside. Needless to say I left and waited for my regular car wash to open just a mile down the street. I will never recommend nor return to this place ever again. MANAGEMENT: Don’t hire young kids who don’t care about your business or it’s customers. People who show up just for a pay check are ruining your business and lost you a few long time and loyal customers.</Review><time>1523458861553< /time><Gmap_id>0x80c2d37e10b36abb:0x92f8e611d89d1962</Gmap_id><Rate>1<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

The only thing I regret is that 3 days ago was my very first experience instead of 21 years ago, when I moved to this neighborhood! Dr Ackerman, is very professional and extremely friendly, just as his help, Sarah and others, put all that with last words of technology (laser, no needle anesthesia and so on) and you have German precision and outstanding results  God bless!<//Review>

Dr. Ackerman is very knowledgeable, gentle, and personable.  I feel confident I am getting the best dental care possible in his office.  All of the staff are wonderful to work with and it is such a well working team, which I appreciate.  It doesn't matter who I am talking to, everyone is very helpful.  I absolutely love Dr. Ackerman and his team!< /Review>

Dr. Ackerman and his girls are very knowledgeable and kind. They always do a great job! New interior design is cozy, yet modern. I would highly recommend Dr. Ackerman if you are looking to switch or are new to the area.< /review>

I've been seeing him for my dentistry needs since the mid 80's. I've seen his practice grow and thrive through the years. I always get outstanding work, clear explanations, and the enjoyment of his outstanding sense of humor. The hygienists and office staff are always friendly, happy, and ready to address any need. One of the absolutely best office experiences I've seen. Gary's and the hygienists' skills are to be complemented too. Getting numbed up for work on a tooth and my teeth cleaned by the hygienist are pain free every time. Going in is as close to "looked forward to" as a dentist visit can be and not dreaded.
And most amazing is how well Gary and the office keep up with new technology and techniques. I've seen an amazing evolution in dental care in the 30+ years in the office. Now they grinding crowns right there in the office and in one visit you have a new crown. Amazing!!! Gary consistently attends dental conferences, vendor presentations, etc. and clearly makes an extra effort to keep up with the latest techniques. And he makes the investment to bring the latest equipment into the office.
If you are looking for a dentist than look no further... Go see Gary.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have been seeing Dr. Ackerman for about about a month now as I have extensive work that is to be done, with more visits to come. I am completely comfortable and confident in his abilities. He is excellent at keeping me informed and educated on what procedures are to be done and what they entail  his staff is extremely friendly and professional. It is never a source of anxiety to visit his office as it has been with past dental "professionals." I highly recommend this office if you are looking for a primary.</Text>

His warm, caring manner is only exceeded by his professionalism and expertise as a dentist.  I have been a patient for several years,and when I moved to another city, I continued to drive to Carmichael to see him.
Tracy, his office manager is also wonderful and has helped me with billing, resulting in a refund from my insurance.
Ashley, his hygienist is knowledgeable and gentle.< /review></record>

Doctor Ackerman and staff are the greatest.  Gary and staff are friendly, professional, caring and most importantly they know what their doing.  Gary has the most up to date dental equipment and he’s not afraid to use it.  I’ve been with Gary since the first week he opened his practice and he hasn’t failed me yet. And most importantly he laughs at my jokes.<//text>

<text>Gary Ackerman and his staff are all wonderful, helpful, informative, and welcoming. I recently moved to the area and and decided to go to this office as my fiancee goes here also and was very pleased. Gary really knows dentistry and I feel I am in very good care. Thank you.

I have been seeing Dr. Ackerman since I was a kid but now I have my husband, and son seeing him too! He's the best, very gentle and patient. Not only is Dr. Ackerman great but so are everyone else in the office, super friendly and always there to help if you need anything. I would (and have) recommend Dr. Ackerman to anyone looking for a good dentist.< /Review>

Our kids are adults now and we still go to Dr. Ackerman. The office is always immaculate and the staff are always welcoming so we would never consider leaving. Throughout the years we have recommended friends and coworkers who share our confidence in everyone at the office of Dr. Gary Ackerman. We highly recommend them.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Dr.Ackerman is amazing! Between him and his staff you will always feel comfortable. I can't rave enough about him. His treatments are quick and painless. Very convenient to schedule appointments. I wish he was my dentist as a child, I would have never feared the dentist.< /Text>

Dr. Ackerman was recommended to me by a friend when I was visiting Carmichael for a couple of weeks.  I lost a filling 10 days before I was sceduled to be back in Chicago and I was concerned about being in pain before I got home.  Dr. Ackerman agreed to see me on an emergency basis.  After an x-ray, photos and a thorough exam, Dr. Ackerman put in a temporary filling which was comfortable, and which lasted just fine until I was able to see my dentist in Chicago.  Dr. Ackerman is a very nice fellow, and he did a great job repairing my dental issue.< /text>

My husband, son and I have been patients of Dr Ackerman for about 25 years. We referred other family to him, as well. All of us find Dr Ackerman able, straightforward, interested in our needs and personable.  Same goes for his office and tech staff.  Scheduling regular and urgent care has always been easy</review>

In 1984 prior to my retirement from the AF I had my final dental check. Everything thing seemed to be fine.  Before I left the building a tech  suggested I see a dentist ASAP.  Evidently I ground my teeth down to a point that they could not be crowned.  It was suggested I contact Dr Ackerman.  My appointed confirmed that only two of my lower teeth could be saved.  For over 30 years I have had several appointments with him and his staff.  Each appointment they reviewed all my medications to insure that he could proceed with a procedure.  Any doubts they contacted my Kaiser doctors to insure it was OK to perform the procedure.  I would personally recommend Dr Ackerman and Staff for there  future dental expertise.  During the past 30 years he has modernized and updated his equipment.  An outstanding dentist and staff.<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Ackerman and his staff have been taking care of me and my family for many years. At my visits, my comfort is always considered, whether I'm getting my teeth cleaned,  x-rays, getting a filling, or getting my first and only crown.
I'm very grateful to have such a wonderful group of people caring for our dental health.
Thank you again.</Review>< pictures>

Dr. Ackerman is great.  The dental care I receive is wonderful, from the complete consultations, to answering all my questions,to  letting me know my options, and to accommodating my schedule to an incredible degree.  I've had a couple of dental emergencies and the staff was great about fitting me in.  The excellent dental care I receive here is great, and the positive attitude of caring Dr. Ackerman and his staff display is a huge bonus.  I recommend Dr. Ackerman highly.</Review>

Dr. Gary ,  What can I say about him except that he is an awesome dentist.  I always hated going to the dentist and then I was lucky enough to have someone recommend Gary's office to me.  What a blessing he has been.  Our whole family goes to him.  His entire office staff is wonderful.  Anyone who is looking for an new dentist needs to visit Dr Ackerman's office.  You will be so happy that you did.<//Text>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr. Ackerman's for over 25 years, and always been treated excellently by Dr. Ackerman and his staff with friendliness, professionalism, and willingness to make my experience positive... whether it be a simple cleaning or more invasive treatment. His office is immaculate and up to date with the most current technology and instrumentation. Recently, I endured dental problems that eventually led to a crown. Although hesitant, I was amazed with the ease and expediency of this process.... unlike years ago!  The entire procedure was just a few short hours, and my permanent crown was made and complete in that time with one appointment!  In fact, during my short wait for my crown to be molded and made, I felt so comfortable in the dental chair that I actually fell asleep!  When I woke, my new crown was placed with no discomfort, and I was able to continue my day eating and drinking immediately!  In fact, the new crown actually looks so real, it looks better than my original teeth!  I am so grateful that Dr. Ackerman made my experience so positive!  Not only did I have same day results with my new crown, but it was painless, quick, and I got in a nap to top it off!

Dr. Ackerman has been my dentist of choice for 27 years (or more). He was recommended to me when I returned to Sacramento from the Bay Area. He is such a wonderful dentist & his staff so thoughtful, kind, and professional that I continued to drive to Carmichael even after my family moved to Placerville! He is considerate, gives careful referrals when needed (Oral Surgery) and is an all around terrific dentist! He and his lovely staff have helped me overcome my fear of the dentist and become a confident, 2 times a year, regular flosser kind of gal!</text>

Dr. Ackerman and staff work together like a well tuned piece of machinery.  Staff is very efficient and professional.  Dr. Ackerman has a wonderful chairside personality, shows much interest in your well being and shows concern for your comfort when you are in his chair.  I do not like going to the dentist but he makes it seem less painful.  That means a lot.<//Review>

The most relaxing, painless,Wonderfull experience,any one would want.
The best of everything, and such friendly staff that loves there work.
And it shows,  It is like family.  and you leave with a great big Smile..
Thanking them seams like is not enough.
I drive over 100 miles each way for this treatment,knowing it is the best dental care anyone could ask for..
And I have Never had better ever. I think this is one reason my health is so good at 70 years young.
Dr.Gary knows his patients and takes the time to go beyond the normal care you would receive any were else..
Thank you all SO VERRY much. George<//review>

Dr. Gary Ackerman and his wonderful staff has taken an unfortunate dental problem and turned it into a success.  They treated me and advised me as if they were advising and treating their own family.  I couldn't be happier.  Many thanks to Dr. Ackerman and their entire staff.</Text>

<Text>Went to Dr. Ackerman on a referral from 1-800-Dentist way back in the 90s.  I had slammed out of a dentist's office in the middle of a root canal and was hurting and bawling and squalling.  They sent me to him because he had a reputation of being gentle and patient.  I went, we fixed, and it took some fixing, including multiple after office hours calls to deal with the pain.  Haven't been anyplace since then.  Hope he doesn't retire anytime soon.</Text>< Pictures>

I have been seeing Dr Ackerman off and on for over 12 years and he is by far the best dentist I could have asked for.  I had horrible experiences with dentists in the past, resulting in no dental work for over 15 years, I shared my fears with Dr Ackerman and he assured me I was in good hands. He was correct, he quickly produced a treatment plan and implemented it.  Also the staff are great, the hygienists do a thorough job, and Dr Ackerman always takes time to make sure the treatments went well.  No more crazy nightmares of ineffective dentists here...</review>

Dr Ackerman and his staff has been mine and my family dentist for years, we would never go to any other dentist ever. My children all grown up now,  will travel long distance to be taken care by Gary. He is an excellent professional and human being.< /review>

Was impressed with effort and thank you.</Review>

I'd say 4.5 out of 5 stars ... no one is perfect, but this dentist and his staff comes as close as anyone I've seen before.
Great staff, organized, well run, and the billing is always right on the money.<//text>

<Review>I have received excellent care at Dr. Ackerman's office.  His staff teaches me new things every time I visit.  I have learned a lot about caring for my dental health.

I appreciate the promptness, the kindness, and the instruction.  It is a very positive experience for someone who is cared, oh, so scared, of going to the dentist.

Sincerely,
Jackie Irene,
Sacramento< /Review>< Pics>

I have found that the hypodermic needle shots Dr. Ackerman gives are the less painful, usually not painful at all, of any dentist that I have had.</Review>

<Text>Dr. Ackerman and his staff are absolutely phenomenal! Im so relaxed in his office, I have nearly fallen asleep several times WHILE Dr. Ackerman was working on me. From the moment you step in the office until you leave, you feel the warmth, friendliness, and professional attitude of the entire staff. I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Ackerman!< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr Ackerman has been our family's dentist for four generations, all the way back to my grandmother, then my mother and myself, and now my daughter.  The office is always a friendly experience, the staff is amazing, and Dr. Ackerman is a great dentist.  I hated shots growing up, he goes so slow with the novacaine you never even feel the shot.... Even at seven years old I wasnt scared of his shots haha.  You will not be disappointed in making this office your family dentist.</Text>

Fresh hand made everything. The rice is moist and flavorful. The beans have real manteca in em. The main dishes are delicious. Pozole is on fire and so is the Mocajete. They have soft tacos similar to street tacos which is nice. There's also a bar in the back and they even serve breakfast which is tasty as well.</review>

<text>What have given more stars but my visit to his restaurant was bad. It was OK once I got there, I understand there is a party of  20 and a party of 10 to arrive and an hour. It took 40 minutes for a  Waitress to try to attempt give me my check, She never came back and I had to go up front,    The cashier Couldn't read the check and had to call for the   Waitress, Both the Cashier and waitress seem rude, The meal was OK but the Mexican rice seemed old. I might go back but until then I will go to senior ponchos Lemoore.<//text>< GmapID>

You seat yourself and the staff were really friendly, and even if the food does take around 10-15 min. it's so worth it. I took my husband here and the atmosphere feels so welcoming and refreshing compared to other places.😊👍<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Sunday mornings very busy, took like 30 min. To get a to go order for 1 person, really should focus more on doing the easy dishes to go first, that way people don't get bunched up in there.....side note: I guess the virus is so smart that it knows not to infect people seating down inside because they didn't have masks on....yet if you were standing inside for a to go order you need to keep mask on...STUPID.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Stopped in for some caldo de pollo bc I was sick and got a margarita while I waited, the soup was great & the margarita was pretty good too. This definitely has the vibes of a family-type mom & pop Mexican joint. One side is straight to-go type tienda and the other side is a sit down style. I'd go back</review>

It's not bad but not great either. Their beans are great to me. I spent 30 bucks on a plate for myself and a kids quesadilla. Nice atmosphere though. Great employees. Very nice and kept up with us.< /Review>

Great food. Best restaurant for me in the valley. The food is delicious. Have not been to another Mexican restaurant that could beat its taste. The service is good. However i like it because it's tables are always clean.< /review>

Wow, second time here.  I had an Ortega Chili Lunch   the first time and it was fibulas, really it was.  The server was "the best".  It was packed, someone had called in sick, she was on it.  This morning, I had Wevos Rancheros. (sp)  Wow, so good. Full plate, lots of food.
Must visit this place if you haven't already.  Thank you guys there at "Tacos Mariscos Colima" for putting up with the Old Man on the bicycle.

PS:  I'm told the Margarita's Blended are very good as well.  Good day.<//review>

<Text>Reason for a 4 star...they did take. 15 to 20 minutes to get our food. Tacos here are great with their homemade tortillas they are large! I'm on my second and super full! It may be from eating two sets of chips and salsa while waiting yo get our food😂<//Text></record>

Food was good. Waiter however, although nice he kept forgetting our requests. He forgot our sugar and then he forgot to bring us our ticket when we were ready to leave. On top of that he used a really stinky and dirty towel to wipe our table down... Table stunk after he wiped it down. It was so unbearable that we had to wipe it down a second time with our scented sanitzer.< /review>

I love this place!! Been coming here for the past 11 years, tortillas are made from scratch and the food is delicious!! reminds me of mom's and grandmas cooking. I have tried many Mexican restaurants and this place has to be my favorite by far.< /text>

<review>I went to Colima for the first time the other day, and I have only heard good things about there food... The food was very good , but the service is very BAD. We got our food and no server ever came back to see if we needed anything else or more to drink.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I had to get up and ask for containers for the food and we had  never got a check , so we had to go up to the counter and ask for it...👎🏽< /review></record></dataset><record>

Been here a few times and haven't been disappointed. So I decided to do this review. Customer service is great. Had menudo a few ago and have to say it's pretty good. They serve it con grano ( with hominy) and I prefer without. The lady gladly said she will remove it and they did. Ordered a side of queso fresco to go with my tortillas. Delicious. Most recently we went and my wife ordered camarones a la diabla and I had a torta of lengua. The camarones were irresistible and had to pinch a couple off my wife's plate. The sauce had its kick so you better like spicy to try these.  The torta was good. Love the toasted bouillon and the lengua was just melting in my mouth. Not like other places I've tried where they left the skin from the tongue. This is a good place to bring your family.</text>

To being mediocre tasting door (made too fast in bulk) To Now where the owners have made a little more coin in their pocket (customizing their leather tables and seats, the custom signage outside, etc.), now we customers are nothing more than a number. I've complained to the owners and their response is that they are sometimes too backed up to keep up.

Well If busy or not, they seem to take way too long to deliver your order. If you dine in, it's at least 20 minutes before you get your food. If you order take out, their script is "your food will be ready in 20 minutes", truth is, you'll wait 45 minutes to an hour.

Bottom line, they have lost me as customer for life!<//Review><Rating>1</Rating><user>100875428998824953745<//user><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

This place has some good solid Mexican food but the service is disappointing. Be aware when you walk in there you're supposed to seat yourself and wait for a waiter...that I didn't know. I was standing awkwardly there for like 10 mins and nobody even bothered to greet me. When I finally figured it out the waitress took another 10 mins to get to me. Mind you I speak Spanish and asked several times for assistance.

The food is good. They give you big portions it just takes a while to come out. I spent around an hour and a half here just literally waiting most of the time. By the way when you come here, you go straight up to the counter to pay, they never come around to give you a check (wish I got the memo).

I think this is a one time place to go, there's so many other Mexican spots around. If you want to kill time here's the place to go!<//review>

The best of the best. There's no need to go to any other Mexican restaurant in Hanford, Colima has the most authentic flavor. From breakfast burritos to Pozole and everything in between, it's all delicious. The homemade corn tortillas are by far my favorite! Colima never disappoints.</review>

Good for a Saturday afternoon. The tortillas were freshly made in-house along with the salsa . We were seated in a dark corner and it was busy so the noise level was high. Overall good woud return. Service is a little slow ticket not brought to table.</review>

In my opinion, the best tasting Mexican food in all of Hanford. Their food is fresh, tasty, and you don't feel too heavy after you eat their food.< /text>

Food is expensive for the portion size. Ordered two burritos and were so small and messy as if they did not take the time to properly make them. Not going back, not worth it.</Review>
