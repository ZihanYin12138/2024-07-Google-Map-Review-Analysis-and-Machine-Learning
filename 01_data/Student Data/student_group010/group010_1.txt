Great place to go car camping! Close to proximity to some wonderful hikes, and the bathroom situation is fairly better than most other campgrounds (though still not too great). Be warned though: the squirrels have associated humans with food, and will beg for food or rummage through your trash. Either leave your food in some solid storage like a cooler or hang it over a tree in a sack.< /Review>

Nice to get up and camp in the mountains. It's also a good place to camp after summiting Mt Baldy.

EDIT: Dec. 31, 2020.

<Review>Stay away. Called the number for this place and they said you could park on the side of the road and allowed fires. But when we got there, the place was desolate and signs said no open fires. Abandoned /graffitied building on grounds, one rest rooms was boarded up, and some bbq grill pits have plastic wrapped around them. No camp host in sight. Felt unsafe and left.</Review>< Response>

We visited this campground over last weekend Oct12/13. There is no option to book the campsite through online portals. All campsites are first come first serve basis. We reached the campground around 11.30a.m on Saturday morning. There were couple of unoccupied sites. One thing to note in these campsites is that the sites are not flat. So, checkout all sites for flatness to setup your tent before finalizing on one. The restrooms are equipped with paper towels, pit-hole toilets. The campsite is equipped with grill, fire-pit, picnic table, and water. One advantage with these campsites is that there is 11.5mi hiking trail just adjacent to it. We did hike a total of 4mi at our own pace. I plan to do 11.5mi hike in our next camping. We were not allowed to light the campfire in the night due to “high fire alert - Santa Ana winds”. So, we spend time inside tent playing Uno. Overall, we had wonderful experience camping here.<//Text>

Great first-come-first-serve camping site close to many good hikes. Keep in mind that there are not bear boxes available, even though the website says otherwise. There are also a lot of flies, and definitely no flush toilets. (They get pretty ripe when it's warm out.)</Text>

<text>Great place to get a snow experience. Make sure you visit the place before chain restrictions are ON. The camping ground has benches and restroom facilities.

We visited on mid January. The place had nice snow and we managed to experience a snow shower as well.< /text><user>115676297516737351623<//user><username>Bimal Sivadas</username><Rating>5< /Rating><Time>1548022734359<//Time><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwzSCALNQZwsNDQc3Nmsj-PnU3eUlFTE_Rb6C5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPj7eqr7ICWaJ6uNUlZchPm6L-bt-Ga6bZf1KRP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyscgxqm3Efs83Z-gTRI2fd4Jn1-pmWyUcRoJl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHq1yj8caAxfRDkiEdEHOYVr4GThG5UCSMGdxp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

Took about 2 hours to get up the hill (same for going down at the end of the day but made for great sunset pictures) in dead stop traffic.  And it was pretty hard to find a spot to park. Bathroom line was about a 30 minute wait. Lots of slopes for sledding with kids and some pretty steep ones for teens and adults.

Hikers will use your campsite as a thoroughfare and take your food if you're not paying attention... or they'll just set up a picnic at your table at 8 am with their family of 7 while you're sleeping in your tent less than 5 feet away. Rangers don't empty the trash bins but have no problem harassing you via loud speaker from the site entrance.
Aside from that, this is a nice place to camp at.< /text>

<Review>Our Experience at Manker Campground was overall good. We had grabbed a spot on a Thursday for the weekend because by friday there are no spots available it is a first come first serve basis. The 1st time we went we picked spot #8. We didn't like that spot much because we do have a little one & she likes to run around & the ground area wasn't that flat! The 2nd time we stayed we had stayed in spot #11 we thought this spot was going to be great they had plenty of trees to hang up our hammock but of course not great for our little one again & the neighbors that decided to stay next to us were up all night their music didn't shut off until 230am than they were howling like wolves like no one else was on the camp ground & than they had the nerve to project their Sexual relations very loudly & our daughter woke up & cried alittle than their sounds kept getting louder & louder. So our last spot was #14 we really enjoyed this spot it was a little more private we weren't in the middle of the campground. We were alittle more away from the bathrooms but thats ok. The only problem with #14 is that it has 2 sites to camp at like its for a group but only 1 parking spot!!! Luckily we arrived 1st than of course a HUGE!!!!!!! family decided to pick the spot next to us & the literally pitched their tent 5 feet away from ours like there wasn't any other spot to put it. So we kindly asked them to move it & they made a big deal out of it. But the overall experience was great I'm giving a 4star rating because of the fact that the bathrooms were smelly & dirty but what more can you expect being out in the wilderness at least there were bathrooms! Thank you Manker Campground for giving me a family a experience, we will of course continue to come here until we find the perfect spot were we aren't too close to neighbors. Pricing is really affordable! You can also day park here for $5 I believe.</Review>< Date>

Mon-Thurs and possibly Sunday night this place is a ghost town and a great place to camp at.

Fri and Sat people jam pack the campsites with 4+ cars at each site and party until 1am.  Which is great unless you wanna be up at 5am to go hiking.   With proper campsite selection you can arrive thursday and sell the large sites to other people to make your money back and then some.< /review>

<review>It was a neat little place.... From what I could see of it... In the dark, from a car. I went there for my first ever camping trip. Well... Almost camping trip. The bear 10 feet away from my car door upon arrival deterred all that lol. No one was hurt and apparently flashlights scare them easily enough. For all that though, it was a great little adventure with some fun memories for the future. I'll definitely be trying it again soon. Hopefully this time with some better luck.< /review><name>Krystal Gonzales< /name>< time>

me and the family always have an amazing time. A little rocky on the ground. But me and my kids always have a blast up there. The waterfall height is perfect for children and everybody and worth it.</review>

Please be careful if camping here. I was camping here 8/20/18 and a bear broke into my sunroof that was completely closed and ate everything in my sealed cooler. They really need bear lockers here and more signs!! I contacted them to let them know as well</Review>

Great location if you plan to hike Mt Baldy! Reserve early, it books fast! Plan for colder weather than you might expect. The altitude makes it significantly cooler than the rest of the LA area.</text>

Small campground, clean bathrooms (for a campground) Went for 2 nights in July with my son and had a pleasant time. There are nice tall pine trees surrounding the camp which has nice picnic tables and fire rings. Great little get away camp less than an hour from Ontario.
There is a nice little hike near by, you can walk to the trail head, up to San Antonio Falls. There are a few longer hikes that you can do from Ice House Canyon trail head which is a short drive from camp.< /Text>

<username>Dan Chirpich<//username><review>This campground does not get cleaned up enough! The bathrooms were trashed Sunday morning. The lock on one was broke. The TP wasn't restocked. The trash cans were completely full. There is quite a bit of small trash scattered around that no one clearly cleans up. Campsites are packed together with zero sense of privacy. Saw a bear the first night there. People chased it off by banging pots loudly at 10pm.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It's amazing during the day too. As for the penalty for camping on a closed campground, 5 years in federal prison and/or $100,000 fine.
Ok probably more like someone walking up and saying "hey you can't do that".
Enjoy the forest.
And please clean up after yourselves.  The bears and racoons just can't seem to clean it up for us.< /text>< Pics>

I love the whole Baldy area, including Manker Flats, which is why this campground gets 2 stars.  Beyond that, however...

When I arrived I began scoping out campsites, and immediately noticed that the whole area had been completely disrespected by previous guests.  Every site was littered with trash, and the one I would have chosen had a large, freshly-broken bottle right in the middle of the tent pad.  Most of the sites had at least a small amount of broken glass.  Also, almost all of the sites are right on top of each other.  At least most of the sites were fairly well shaded.

After finally selecting a site and starting to set up, I noticed the flies... LOTS of flies... So many buzzing around my head that I actually inhaled/swallowed one.  Ewww.  Now, I get it... it's nature... and late summer heat often means lots of flies, but it was still not a pleasant experience... and I have camped many places where I wasn't constantly under attack by flying insects.

Eventually, I needed to use the restroom... or not.  It was filthy, and the urinal was apparently clogged and overflowing.  I walked right out... a little ways away from the campground... and found a bush for some privacy.

I was sleeping in a hammock, so it wasn't until my friend arrived to set up his tent that I realized that the tent pads are a pretty awful dirt/rock combination that: make it hard to drive stakes; is bad for the bottom of tents; and can be rather uncomfortable to sleep on top of.

The grate on the firepit was almost impossible to manage.

The group with the campsite across from us was blasting music (electronic, hip hop, and either arabic or persian music) until at least 3 in the morning.

You are allowed 2 cars per site, but we really had to work to fit 2 cars into our parking space... Our bumpers were literally touching, and the front of his car was still slightly in the roadway.

We still had a great time... It's a beautiful place with some great hiking and fun stuff to do up at the Notch... but this campground needs work.< /text>

<text>Pros: there's a trail that leads to a nice waterfall,very much a real camping experience beautiful nature surroundings.

Cons: BEARS WILL come to your campsite at night and steal your food,doesnt matter if it's in your cooler or hidden,however they are Not violent at all. Mosquitos are evrryyywhereee and the bathrooms are super nasty(better off peeing outside).

Overall,the location,price and scenery are worth while.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The air is very good and it's easy to climb the mountain. While sleeping overnight, there were many mosquito sprays. It is good place to make good memories with family and anyone

Unfortunately had a bad experience here and when we reached out to corporate nobody has responded so I feel I must share our experience publicly.

We ordered breakfast burritos and received the wrong  burrito. I tried to call back and could not get through, I ended up calling, and this is sadly not an exaggeration, eleven times before they picked up the phone. The person taking orders was Julius and he was not apologetic when they messed up my burrito the first time, he was even less so when we had to go back for the THIRD time because they had messed it up again. When I called (for the 12th time!) he actually chuckled and seemed to find it funny that the order had been messed up again. He blamed kitchen staff, however when I was there it appeared he continuously gave them the wrong order. They were the only ones who seemed to know what they were doing.

We tried to reach out to the Aztec Grill customer service email and have not received any type of response back. Unfortunately solely due to how Julius acted I can not recommend Aztec Grill to anyone, and we used to be frequent visitors.<//text>

Wow, I would not have expected the quality of food from a gas station Mexican setup.  Service was quick, food was hot and super tasty, salsas were spicy.  I highly recommend this place.  4 friends and I agree: Thumbs up!< /Review>

It was just kind of ant like it was okay it was decent and for the price of the burrito I thought I was going to get more. Like I know I shouldn't expect much out of the gas station restaurant. But when your paint to $11 for a burrito why would I not just go to a regular Mexican restaurant. I just expected for the price for it to be better and it wasn't it was a typical fast-food let down. With a high price price</Review>

I love their food!  My only suggestion is to avoid the steak...a lot of grisle.  The chicken and chorizo are very good.  Be specific when you order explaining exactly what you want and don't want in your order and you will love it.< /text>

<review>The Aztec Grill is one of the best fast food secrets of the North Coast.  The grill in Lakeport is no exception.  The fajitas are very good.

Thank you thank you thank you more again for helping me navigate this god-awful city and my love and hate relationship with it. I found this place and I have been excited ever since four loads of laundry for $10 well what I consider a load of laundry they're only 275 / washer and then it's like $0.50 to dry thank you for saving my sanity my soul and the population of San Francisco< /text>

If you want to hit an intersection of a Tenderloin cleansing and an ethnic wash n dry come to First Coin. Hint: always count the coins you put in the machines in case it doesn't work you can tell the manager to reimburse.<//Text>

This place was a nice change of pace from other Vietnamese restaurants. They serve crispy noodles, stir-fried with vegetables and your choice of protein. I opted for chicken and curry, but wished I had gone with tofu. The chicken was a bit dry, but the curry had a nice flavor. I forgot to tell them I wanted medium spice which was actually a good thing because the curry was already spicy to begin with.<//Text>

Plus: you will get a free basket of pastries with purchase at the next door when you eat here and brings a receipt l.

I am writing the review purely based on the pho.

The broth was VERY SALTY!!
I think MSG and fish sauce over powers other flavors. I couldn’t taste anything else.

I don’t recommend this place to pho l. If you know other good dishes, that’s great.

The waitress was nice and friendly. I don’t see many Spanish girl work for a Vietnamese restaurant, so that’s a bit new for me.

If you compare the portion and protein contents in the pho, the cost performance is about average.

The place is clean. That is good.

My only mystery is this. There is another Asian lady at the restaurant, she dresses like she came from some other places open very late night... Interesting. And the way she talks reminded me Anjelah Jonhson’s stand up. Haha

this place doesn’t do anything bad. I just cannot take the salty broth and go better pho places.<//Review>

This is my favorite local pho shop! I have been here probably 15+ times over the last 2 years and it never fails to disappoint. The large pho with beef is amazing, and they give you a good amount of meat plus a big bag of garnishes for takeout. No skimping on quality here! I usually order the crispy fried egg rolls with the lettuce wraps, and they are so good as well. I'll be eating at Vietnam's Pearl as long as I'm in the OC! Best cure for when you're feeling a little under the weather.

Ordering over the phone is easy, the lady owner is really nice and the food is always ready within 20 minutes. Can't be beat!<//text>

<Review>Awesome Pho / Vietnamese food. One of my local favorite hole in the wall places. Been a handful of times and never disappoints. Good food. Nice people. Good service overall. The hours can be sometimes confusing (closing early and/or off on some week days as I remember) but worth it to try to fit it into your schedule.</Review>< user_id>

<text>I love this place! The menu has a great variety of pho, banh mi, salads, and various meat/rice dishes. The service is usually fast except during their busiest times when it does seem to take a little longer than your average Vietnamese restaurant but the quality and flavor has always been great so it's worth it! There's usually no wait to be seated even during peak times which I greatly appreciate. The owner and staff are very friendly and make this a really cozy place to eat a meal. Be aware that it is a pretty small restaurant so probably not great for huge groups but it's a nice intimate place for a casual dinner with your significant other.<//text>< UserId.>

This place is very small and always crowded!  That's because the food is so good.   The server and owners are very friendly.  Music videos play constantly, but not over bearing.  Every receipt comes with a coupon for The Straw shake place next door.  Best time to come is midweek in the early afternoon.< /Text>

Great Vietnamese spot! I love to come here because they cater to the vegetarian population and have menu items for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. I love their vegetarian pho and egg rolls not to mention they're fresh coconut water. The staff is also very nice and patient and can answer any questions you may have regarding their menu items.< /review>

<text>The 90s music vibe is strong here. This is a funky little restaurant for sure. With the artsy atmosphere comes good food and service as well. I ate the vermicelli with beef and washed it down with a unique coconut creme vietnamese coffee. I'm definitely making this a lunch spot!< /text>< pictures>

The wait is always at least 25 minutes to get my order from the time I walk in to the restaurant to the time I begin eating. Today I had to wait 5 minutes to even be acknowledged as a customer. A party of 4 came in a couple of minutes after me and were greeted, seated, menus brought, and drinks ordered in less than a minute and ALL before I was even addressed. I always go alone and am casually dressed so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the service I receive. I frequent this restaurant only because it's the healthiest choice literally around the corner from my work and I keep thinking/hoping the service will get better. Today it was the worst yet. I do have to say, however, that the woman (owner?) is quick, very efficient, and a good hostess. But she has been in the kitchen on all save for one of my visits. The food is good but it's your average Vietnamese dish at a south Orange County price. The vermicelli meat combo is $10, whereas, in Little Saigon 5 miles north I can get a greater quantity for $7 (same quality). If they had quicker service I'd give them 4 stars. Add on lower prices and it'd be a definite 5 stars. But, I get it, they have to pay rent and feed their families, too. FYI you can order food from their menu and eat it next door at the shakes place and vice versa since they share the same owner.</Text>

<Text>Always consistent Pho and great spring rolls. Vegetarian options avaialble. Broth is very favorable without all the unnecessary salt! If you live or work in the surrounding area then this has to be your go-to Vietnamese establishment. Menu has some creativity to blend with the alternative tunes playing in the background. More of a hip vibe, without the added cost! Won't disappoint!</Text>< Date>

I don’t really like writing reviews but since it was a really bad experience i will. First off our order was taking longer than it should the people after us got there order before us, so we got up and ask for our bill when my husband was paying this cockroach was climbing the wall.< /text>

After my favorite pho spot closed I went in search of a new place. I have officially found it, I'm about 6 visits in and I have yet to have to add anything to my broth other than a little chili paste for a low burn. Meat is not fatty, perfectly sliced, and cooks to perfection in its broth. I will now recommend this place to all my pho enthusiasts.< /Text>

I'm sorry to say this but white people do get that previlaged, 4 white girls came and sat next to us, right away they were offered water and asked if they ready to order.

Patrick and crew run an amazing spot. Great pho (the bo vien meatballs are so tender!). But it's not just a pho place. Their vermicelli bowls and salads are all also amazing as are their egg/spring rolls. Not only that but they have great music (and play music videos) and great art. Don't think twice about stopping in if you have a hankering for great vietnamese with great service and ambiance.< /Text>

Service is good, but I am biased when it comes to having Beef Pho (soup)...I would rather go to Bolsa Ave.  I have been here at least 3 times already when my coworkers can't take longer lunch to go to Vietnamese District on Bolsa Ave (a.k.a Little Saigon)<//Review>

First I'd like to put out there that I do not enjoy the music/atmosphere but many will as it is pop culure music. There is a very diverse menu of great looking food. I cam for the pho. I have pho all the time and found this pho lacking: the meat was tough,  the noodles too, and the broth was a fairly tasteless. It was a nice place and I would go back; just not for pho.< /review>

I recommend this place to anyone currently trying to obtain a CA Guard Card. Reason being is it’s a one stop shop! Lula does everything needed for you to obtain your card from the 8hr course to the Live Scan and even helps you register online so that your application is processed faster! Also she’s straight to the point and makes sure your aware of all the key points that will be on your test. The only thing I would’ve done differently is taking the Firearm Permit course together instead of separately. This place is great and if anyone says otherwise it’s probably a competitor trying to troll the reviews... nice try guys!
Thanks again Academy! I’ll be in soon for that firearm permit!

Lula will put your on the right track in this career. Also she has a board where Security Companies will be put up their flyers for employment. The Security Company I work for has several people who got their Guard Card at Academy Security Training.<//text><name>G & J White<//name><userid>107757109834763270210</userid>< Pics>

The place was kind of hidden so I wasn't sure where it was but eventually found it. Lula was very informative and knowledgeable! She made sure to cover all aspects of rules and regulations and legalities of becoming a security guard. The video was a little rough to watch but completely covered all the material! I also like that she asked those who currently had experience if they had anything to add to the subject matter for situation awareness with different company policies! I loved the fact that we tested, did the livescan, and she also took the extra time and effort to assist each of us to submit our paperwork online to the BSIS! Lula went far and beyond for us and am very grateful for it! One stop shop for the whole process and recommend her to everyone! I don't understand where the bad reviews came from but I am surely impressed!!!!!<//review>

<Review>Terrible place to go to for a firearm license. I was referred to this place by a friend/co-worker who took his guard card and firearm license renewal here. I didn't want to do it in the first place because of the distance, since I live in Whittier. I took the risk and went for it and paid for all the required charges after passing the written test. Next up was the range class but could not go forward because of the dates she schedules. Lula only does range classes on Fridays at 11 am. After repeatedly explaining to Lula that I have a graveyard shift preventing me to make a Friday morning appointment, I ended up wasting my money and time. I went to her first class on a Saturday for a reason, and my co-worker claimed to have taken the range on a Saturday. What bothers me most about this is that there is a firearm training place less than 30 minutes away from me that offers Monday through Saturday range classes! Lesson learned: Do your own research, follow your own plans and never go to Lula for your firearm license!!</Review>< pictures>

<text>Easy access trails, lovely views across the lake, ample fishing access, and great kayaking. Have also grilled here a few times - there are several grills and tables spaced out near the bait shop. Plenty of Porta Potties and a clean restroom available for all-day visits.</text>< rating>

Came here to fish with my dog, and one of the wardens or employees said "the dog is fine right now, but don't bring him again, we don't allow that kind"
My dog is properly trained and was sitting down through the whole exchange of words. He further explained the water is the "source of drinking water in the raw stage", yet they allow boats? Not sure what his deal was but I won't be returning here and God forbid you have a Pitbull that behaves well.</Text>< pictures>

Beautiful views!

We spent most of our time at the park at the end of Wueste Rd. It was filling up and getting crowded as people prepared for parties. It was a Saturday, so we expected that. Because of the parties, all the shade structures were taken, so I recommend bringing your own shade.</review>

This is a nice little lake. Unfortunately, you cannot water ski, tube, wakeboard or anything like that. But, if you are into fishing, sailing, kayaking, paddle boarding or canoeing, this is the place for you. It is kind of pricey. You don't pay by car, you pay by person. So a family or group and get kind of expensive if you go a lot. This lake is only open Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays. They do have boat rentals.< /review>

I was raised on this lake.It is the first lake that was stocked with Florida strain Big Mouth Bass And Crappie And bluegill.Also the catfish are nice an big.But it’s a really tough lake to fish because they are not open all the time.So get in where you fit in and go fishing!</Review>

Also, our building is serviced by Orkin, perhaps you saw ants in the box? We're not a restaurant and as far as I'm aware we don't have a roach problem.

<Review>So I came in looking for a Full living room set, they had overpreiced okay stuff but not ONE employee asked if I needed help, the WHOLE  time I was there I walked throughout the entire store, front to back. And ended up walking out when I saw all the cockroaches and bug traps, I got grossed out...... 0 out of 5 stars for the service and bugs< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

<Review>It was interesting driving up to McCreery's. It stands out among the surrounding buildings. Once inside, it is like you're in a different world. The staff let us wonder around in the calmness of the store, before asking if we wanted any info. We decided on a rustic dresser and a sectional. The quality is amazing! A gigantic step from our Amazon prime sofa for sure! Overall great furniture store. We will definitely be going back for bedside tables, chairs and perhaps another dresser.</Review>< user>

We were looking to upgrade our present living room furniture and we were allowed to roam the store at our leisure but Greg was very accommodating with any questions we had! I would rate  McCreery's as Sacramento's better Home furnishing Store! Best selections around!</Review>

Great selection, some of the best quality furniture available in Sacramento! Only a few places still have high quality furniture, this is one of them! Knowledgeable and helpful staff as well!<//Text>

<Text>A recent home purchase in Sacramento put us in "Home Furnishing"shopping mode, much to the delight of my wife, and not so much to my delight.  Having looked at a few different furniture stores we ended up at McCreery's.  Granted, it was a shopping experience, so not a situation I consider remotely fun, but the staff made our hunting for quality pleasurable.  They put up with my disinterested attitude and let me wander around and showed my wife some nice furniture that was within our budget and did it without a high pressure sales situation.

It was a smart decision on our part to choose them and, if I ever have to go though the process of furnishing a new home, they will be our first call.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I am a big fan of your Home Furnishing store due to have a lot of variety of popular brands such as Stanley, Hooker, Flexsteel and much more. After I bought a condo in Boulevard, I searched for quality furniture for my loving home. I started to search online and got some great result over Google. I checked your website and determined to visit the store. I am really happy after checked branded furniture in McCreery's Home Furnishing. Staff members are quite great and deals professionally. Thank you McCreey for your great service.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I had just the loveliest experience shopping at McCreery's Furniture last week.  Looking for a love seat for our den, I was fortunate to see exactly what I wanted but in a color that just did not work.  The staff there showed me some samples and made the buying process as pleasant as one could ever ask for.

I can't wait for the delivery and I know it will be perfect thanks to their help!< /text>< pics>

We purchased a sofa, chairs, tables, and a TV stand. Marian Kader was fantastic in her help. She found the style of furniture that we had talked about. She was a huge help when it came to finding the right fabric to fit with our décor. The service we received was excellent from the start right through the delivery.  We will be back when we are ready to purchase more furnishings.</Text>

< review>
McCreery's is great and the furniture is very high quality.  We wound up there after declining to buy more particle board, I hesitate to even call it furniture, stuff from an office store.  The desk we bought will probably survive a nuclear blast but it cost a small fortune too.  On the other hand, the sofa and chair we bought are very reasonably priced and much better quality than the Recliner company recliners that I've had to reinforce a couple of times because they are stapled together.  The furniture McCreery's sells is actually good quality and well built.  My only complaint is their phone system sucks, it's terrible, I can barely understand them.

I had an issue with a desk chair (split in the leather seat) and they fixed it.  It took a little while for them to persuade the manufacturer to send the part but it came and they fixed it under warranty so I'm happy about that.<//review>

The horchata and garlic shrimp, camarones de ajo, the greens and cheese, everything was fresh and delicious.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8DoyBjpil9ppdVHD6li3w32AO6tY3E3l-ga2d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuYXnRzbrUuG9XiCL7EV_IBUuVbMu09T3v62ED=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Plump, fresh, juicy, big shrimp with fresh cheese on my tostadas.  It wasn't on the menu but I asked and I'll order it again; sorry I forget the price but it was so reasonable, I thought "We have to make this our regular stop between the Bay Area and Pismo".  Family member had carne asada soft tacos, yum.  Great food, prices are just as good!  Clean, no flies, not too noisy, comfortable.  King City appears to be a nice little town.</Review>

Honestly this is one of the best facilities I’ve been to. Sylvia is absolutely amazing. She answered answered or returned my calls very promptly. Sylvia was extremely helpful, she answered all my questions and aided me through this entire process. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Best experience I’ve had with a doctors in a long time. Thank you for everything!< /review>

I have to rate my experience with Premier Podiatry A++++.  From the very first appointment to the follow up,  to the scheduling of my surgery everything has gone perfect.  I saw Dr. Winters she evaluated my foot gave me four choices of treatment. After discussing options with my spouse and the doctor we decided on a treatment plan. Sylvia was tasked with helping me schedule my surgery, get my paperwork in line for work, my tests arranged.  She has been ON TOP of it :).  The entire experience so far has just been a wonderful.  I can not speak highly enough about the staff and doctors.  Would definitely recommend!</Text>

<review>I'm a few months post op and couldn't be happier.  Dr. Fuji gave me my life back.  Because he and his staff are so very kind, caring & compassionate I just had to say something about this very professional medical office.  They are truly the best of the best.  Forever grateful. THANK YOU!

I've been a patient of Premier Podiatry & Orthopedics since 2015.  I've always received excellent service and treatment and especially with my current planning for a knee replacement.  Once the decision was made, I was assigned a surgery scheduler, Sylvia Rodriquez, who has been on top of all the planning and action required to prepare for and schedule the surgery.  She is very conscientious and responsive.  She responds quickly and has answered all my questions.  With her assistance, I'm confident that my surgery will go well.< /text>

<review>I had the pleasure of meeting a professional, personable and supportive medical team. I was a new patient and I was provided the medical attention required; ex-rays, wrapping of my ankle and I was able to fully understand why I need surgery as well as shown to me in the images from the ex-rays. I was helped into a temporary boot to keep from any movement and I was instructed on how to prepare for surgery and pointers on what will help speed up and fully recover after the procedure. I give the providers, and all the staff that work at Premier Podiatry & Orthopedics located in Roseville on Sunrise Ave, FIVE STARS!
⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️  ⭐️

I appreciate your commitment to excellence!

The staff at Premier Podiatry and Orthopedics is so attentive, professional and friendly. From office visits to paperwork they are there to help and assist. I have had several appointments and always leave feeling very confident that my concerns were addressed and that I am getting the best care possible! I especially want to thank Sylvia Rodriguez for taking care of all the little details that are involved with my upcoming surgery.  Your calm and assuring voice via our phone calls and easy to understand directions are so greatly appreciated.</text>

It all starts with entering a business from being greeted at check in!  5 star customer service, friendly, and at check-in and staff, especially Brenda is fantastic!!!   All of the other staff implements professionalism, detail, and always answers questions thoroughly!   Now on to Dr. Gavin Ripp, I'm coming off 16 months from a ruptured achilles injury and was referred to him and his practice from my family physician.  So privileged to have Dr. Ripp as my new Orthopedic Foot Doctor.  He is so knowledgeable, spends a lot of time going over future treatments, therapies, and most importantly what to expect in the future with my recovery from my injury.< /review>

Great service and friendly staff. You are seen in a timely manner. No waiting very long to be called back. The receptionist Sabrina is especially great. She makes sure to schedule around what works best for you. She is very informative and makes sure you know exactly what is going to happen and gives you all information and instructions beforehand. She always has a smile on her face and is very welcoming. Overall my experience here has been A1. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for excellent service and care.<//review>

< Review>
The front desk was nice, young lady doing my intake was great. A Michael-came in no introduction so I hv to guess he was a Dr.? I asked if the healing fracture was meant broken & he sarcastically said Yes fracture is broken I said I wondered if I was a cracked Tibia. he snapped back with There's all kinds of fractures. he squeezed below my knee a few times, gave me a PT referral & left. Perhaps a bad day or all those years in school didn't afford him time for a class in diplomacy. I am not impressed & will ask my Dr., to refer me elsewhere. life is too short to deal with rude people.< /Review>

But the front desk informed me that much of their scheduling is done overseas so that would explain why someone overseas booked me for an appointment during which no one who had any form of expertise would be present.<//text><Time>1617051383597<//Time>< UserId.>

I had to see doctor Ripp due to going on medical and he contradicted my last orthopedic surgeons recommendation that led me to getting my SSI disability not approved. Now I'm actually for the first time in my life going to be homeless due to this place not agreeing that I shouldn't be working with a broken ankle after a failed 8th surgery. I would seriously stay away from this place Thanks Dr Ripp for disagreeing with my Dr Lian who has 30 more years experience then you. You have ruined my lifw Dr. Ripp. I now have to be on painkillers Instead of getting my ankle fixed which is ruined my marriage and my life. I suggest anybody stay away from this place.

<text>Dr. Winters is the best Podiatrist I've ever had.   I've learned so much about my feet and ankles from her.  She's remarkably thoughtful.
Her recommendations, coupled with her wry wit, are deeply appreciated.<//text>< Pics>

Very rude front desk employees. Don't say anything about having to wait for 1 hour until they open especially when you have a appointment for 12:30. They need to be taught some lessons on how to treat people. I still would get back to this office. I have nothing against the doctors. They just need some more friendly front lobby employees.</Review>

I suggest this office to EVERYONE who is in pain and needing relief. Dr. Sean Betesh is an artist. I was amazed and my expectations were absolutely blown away with the final result of my first surgery. Enough that I went in for the same procedure on my left foot with no anxiety. His assistant Katie is amazing and on top of anything that you need. A stand out for me was Sabrina the Doctor’s scheduler. Not only did she contact me quickly, but nothing I asked was ever met with anything but an honest and caring answer. She made sure any equipment that I needed would be available to me before even getting home from surgery.
Couldn’t have asked for a better team of people!!!!
Thanks y’all!< /text>

< Review>
I have been going to Premier Podiatry in Carmichael for the past few years, (quite, frequently I might add) and the experiences that I have had are over the top.

Dr. Winters and her staff have been absolutely wonderful.  Sylvia has worked close with  me scheduling all of my pre-op, operations and post-op appointments and is always kind and understanding and helps  me prepare for what I might need to do and is very responsive to my questions.

My friends and family rather enjoy accompanying me to all of my appointments!  I refer you to any that might require your expertise.

Thank you all!<//Review>

< Review>
I seen a PA there, and they gave me poor care... I went in there ready to show the areas of my shoulder and details. All he did was ask me my history and didn't look at my shoulder and have me do certain movements and did not give me options i have....all he did was say I cant help you and I'll have to refer you to someone else and thats it, I was shocked and said that's it? That PA was horrible. Doctors, PA, NP and nurses just suck these days they dont care, they do it for the money but not the purpose..</Review>

Second post, I mistakenly posted when I did a few months back. I worked closely with Sylvia regarding my disability claim in the information she needs to enter from the doctor. Especially during these times, ensuring the disability money is consistent is of the upmost importance. My initial filing, I had an issue with the EDD site and Sylvia stepped in to help immediately. Today I sent her another request to update my information on the website and she did not hesitate. This is the type of service Service this top-notch employee provides! I’m extremely happy with the doctors at Premier Podiatry and with the support I get from Sylvia and the staff!</review>

<Text>The staff here is so nice. Dr. Batesh is great. Its nice to know that him & his staff cares deeply for their patients. I like the fact that they explain everything to you so that you understand everything completely.
They do everything in their power to fix you. Unlike some doctors who hears you but doesn't listen and just prescribe meds to bandage pain.

I've  been coming to Premier's Roseville office about 2 1/2-3 months and have always had a positive experience with all my staff. It's a pleasure to come in.
I get in quickly, have good interactions w/staff even laughs, don't have to wait long, feel heard and cared for. Thanks so much!
Just one thing I'd love to hear it a few of the best Bettish fetish jokes next time.. Have fun, be healthy, Fawn< /Review>

<text>I discovered the spa service offered be Premier Podiatry and Orthopedics when I accompanied my Mother for her podiatry appointment. My feet needed serious attention as I developed fungus from going to a nail salon. The wonderful service I received from Ashley was just what I needed.She worked on my feet and had them looking better in our session. She gave me written instructions on how to soften my calluses and stop the fungus. The service I received was directed towards improving the health of my feet. I will be going back in a few weeks for further treatment.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Extremely friendly staff. Dr.Betesh is amazing explains everything thoroughly and listens to his patients. Two years ago I first went to this office for my son who broke his heel jumping off a roof. We had Dr.McDowell and I was so happy with our experience back then even. This place is the best highly recommended if you want the best podiatry and orthopedic doctors and staff.< /Review>< pictures>

Sylvia was brilliant to work with helping me set up an appointment for my mother to see Dr Fuji. She set everything up electronically for her as far as X-rays, insurance etc. Refreshing to be able to work with someone with such ease when it comes to medical appointments.

<Review>I found every part of Doctor Fuji's team to be excellent.  They were friendly, efficient, helpful and went out of their way to make the surgical experience as pleasant as possible.  I thought Sylvia was the best!

Once again, Doctor Fujii and his team are the best.  My next surgery is looking to proceed as smoothly as the first one (a different knee.....).  I want to thank Sylvia especially for going above and beyond.  Thank you all.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1598551439004, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

I have been seeing Dr. Ripp for over 5 years now and I would not go to anyone else.  When I started seeing him as my podiatrist I was living in Roseville, now I live in Reno NV and I drive to Carmichael, CA to see him.  He is fantastic as is his office staff. I would not go eta anyone else.<//Text>

< Review>
30+years in the Healthcare field and I am astounded that such lack of service, care and empathy exists. 2 months of dealing with this office and it hasn't improved. Prescriptions not turned in, x-ray requests never submitted (twice), phone calls not returned,  rude receptionists who arbitrarily moved apt without notice. And to date not one person has even looked at the break relyingonly on xray. Saddened that this is the level of care they choose to provide.< /Review>

I would not recommend all of them to my friends and family.
Doctor is excellent. The staff that schedules the surgeries need to have more communication to their patients they need to verify your insurance before scheduling surgery and making sure its right they waited til the day of the surgery date to inform me that it wasn't going to happen all they do is avoid your calls instead of being upfront with you. Number one they disappointed me the way it was handled very unprofessional.  Never deal with Roseville office terrible experience I ever had.<//Text>

My husband needs surgery due to bike accident. Dr Fuji’s staff efficiently scheduled him as soon as possible. On that day that they got the referral, Karen called us for an appointment for that same day. Upon arriving to the office, she was very accommodating. Michael, Dr Fuji’s PA  saw us right away. As soon as it was determined that my husband will have surgery,  Sylvia efficiently coordinated the Surgery and pre- op labs. Sylvia was thorough and specific with all the instructions of what to do and expect. Overall, I am glad Dr Abalos referred us to Dr Fuji.<//text>

< Review>
I called to get scheduled for a visit due to a small blister and cut under my toe. Sylvia was able to get me in right away. This was very much appreciated sue to I want to stay on top of any foot problems. I was greeted with friendly faces and Andrea roomed me and asked questions as to my concerns. While in the room, Sara, a new physician came in to see me before Dr.Ripp came in. She was very informative and diagnosed me quickly, Dr.Ripp agreed with her assessment. This made me feel confident with my situation. Thanks to all of the staff! Great visit as always.<//Review>

This was my second visit and it was just as smooth as the last visit, Sylvia was very greeting when I walked it and got me set up and ready to go in no time, when dr winters came in she made my visit more calming by trying to get my attention away from the first initial shot. After that everything went smooth just like that last!</review>

Gavin Ripp, DPM, is incredibly thorough when discussing my health issues, using terms a layman can understand. He listens well to my concerns and answers all my questions with sensitivity, with an added ability to add humor and comfort to an otherwise anxious situation.

I needed to have  rotator cuff surgery done on my right shoulder. My primary physician highly recommended Dr. Fuji for the treatment.  I called McDowell Group and was scheduled very quickly.  I  was scheduled for the surgery but wanted it done sooner. I contacted Dr. Fuji's surgery coordinator Sylvia who went out of her way to help me with my request. She called me back  few days later and told me that all has been taken care of and my request to have the schedule pulled  in was very difficult but she was able to approve it
Dr. Fuji is very knowledgeable with many years of experience but what I liked the most was his directness and supportive attitude and told me what I would be experiencing through this treatment. So far he has been 100% correct, I am now 3 weeks post op.
Sylvia was very kind and tried her best to support my request. Overall I am very happy with my selection and highly recommend McDowell O&P group.

Thank you Dr. Fuji and Sylvia.<//text>

<review>Dr Gavin Rippt Podiatry and staff were very welcoming, helpful & friendly as soon as I hobbled into their office. Dr Rippt was very easy to talk with, he was thorough, & knowledgeable, he answered questions also. He began a plan to work on my many issues dealing with my feet- some I didn’t realize I had or caused by my feet issues. I was so pleased with Dr Rippt, the staff, & the plan for correction. I recommend him to anyone needing help with foot issues, etc.<//review>< user_name>

He has a great sense of humor he can hold a conversation where others just want to see you and get you out asap he listens to what you have to say and get straight to the point. He does things beyond what is called for I had a problem and after a full day of appointments he did the emergency surgery the same day and was there for hours. I cant be happier and I am walking once again...thank you dr. Ripp and his staff are all professional and as nice of people I have even known they are ALL kind and attentive, that you one and all I have never had a bad visit.</text>< Pics>

< Review>
Dr. Ripp was recommended to me by some friends, and I wish I had met him last year, before my foot surgery.

I appreciated Dr. Ripp’s honesty. Being forthright is critical when you are discussing any kind of surgery and the expected outcomes. Dr. Ripp is thorough, and has the best bedside manner; you can tell he is an expert in his field.  Mostly, patients will know that they are not merely a “number!”  Dr. Ripp will be my chosen surgeon.</Review>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr.Ripp for a little over 2 yrs. I had a foot surgery in which he was able to save my leg from amputation. He has been very attentive with my recovery from routine visits to surgery to a foot prosthetic. Great staff from front office to back office, they are are always happy to help with any questions or concerns. I highly recommend.< /text>< GmapID>

Ridiculous!The office staff has no idea what they are doing with insurance! They are rude. One has no idea what the other is doing and they constantly contradict each other. Its been now over two months waiting for my childs inserts and because they failed to collect co pay at time of fitting they have not even sent the molds to be made!!! And in this time there has been no communication to us. Do not waste your time with this office. Find an office that actually practices patient care!!!<//Review>

I don't think he did either, finally I started seeing Doctor Ripp at McDowell Orthopedics, first visit I knew that he had done his homework and checked my records thoroughly together we came up with a plan that's being put into action swiftly, Dr. Ripp is very open and straightforward with me about my outcome and I trust his judgment. The office staff really seem to know what they're doing as well good atmosphere. I'm glad I ended up here I know I'm in good hands now.< /Text>< Pics>

I have had 3 bad experiences and would recommend those seeking a podiatrist who actually cares about the patient look elsewhere. The final straw occurred today when the office told me my choices were to wait a week for appointment, or wait 4 days, provide my own X-ray and schedule my appointment in another city. There has to be a podiatrist in the area whose staff and care providers actually take an interest in the care of the patients.< /text>< pictures>

The staff at the Roseville office were super helpful, supportive, and patient. I had an issue with my toe and as a diabetic, I needed it looked at asap. I must admit, I did have a minor meltdown due to anxiety, but the staff were so understanding, especially Dr. Sean Betesh. Totally recommend this office!< /text>

< Review>
I honestly regret having the surgery I waited so long for and was excited to have done however the pain is worser after surgery I wish I would have left my hammer toe alone before it only hurt during hard compression now it’s a daily constant ongoing ache I still can not wear certain shoes nor can I wear hills very disappointed.<//Review>

They sold me my gun safe back in 2013 with the pge power grid shut down that happened last night on my street. I went there to buy a safe light for the gun safe door so i could see the numbers in the dark when i have to dial the combination to open the safe.< /review>

<text>T&T safe has a great selection of quality safes such as the best Fort Knox safes and others they have from New to used safes for sale.  All sizes and shapes and very old fashioned types of safes.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I recently purchased a 12 gun safe organizer that unfortunately came without the hardware to mount the organizer to the door panel. Debra from T and T Liberty Safe was excellent. I'd give this business a 10 stars if I could. She listened to my issue, understood the problem, and resolved my issue in a timely manner. Instead of having Liberty ship me all the hardware to properly mount the organizer, she is having them ship me a whole new organizer. Thank you Debra for all that you've done, it is greatly appreciated.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>T&T Safes rocks!! This place is the only place in Bakersfield to buy a safe. Between family we own 7 Liberty safes. All of them amazing, 1 not purchased from T&T safes. They have an amazing show room that will make you drool even if you don't really care about safes or guns. After walking thru, you'll want one. They have amazing customer service and have managed 3 issues for the family. Just recently I had an issue with a small hand gun quick vault. Rather than giving me the run around with corporate, they simply did some quick troubleshooting (ie. Check the battery). No obvious fix, so they grabbed a new one and handed it to me, at no cost. They stand behind their product and don't give you any headaches. Absolutely will recommend to everyone. They also rent safe jacks, and moving services.</review>< Pictures>

I bought a Liberty Safe from this company (for my home) almost 20 years ago, and recently decided to upgrade to a larger safe. The showroom had many models to choose from and the sales reps. are very knowledgeable. It was a pleasure to deal with a local company that has been in business for so many years. Service was excellent and I highly recommend Liberty safes - made in the USA!< /review>

<Text>Great place. Knowledge staff with large selection of safes. Sales team was great and patient. Really flexible with pick of products and rental of moving equipment was a plus. Will definitely buy from them again.</Text>< UserId.>

My wife and I recently purchased a Fatboy Jr safe during their "no tax sale". They held it until I was ready for delivery. I called for delivery and they came out the next day! That is probably not typical, but it worked for me. The delivery/install guys were prompt, courteous and quick- in and out less than 1 hour including bolting it down. It fit perfectly in a closet with room to hide it behind doors or a curtain. They set up the interior lights and our password/combinations. The safe is a really cool dark green marble exterior with a clean interior including fully adjustable shelves. All smoothed out, for less than $2k we have a fantastic safe for fire protection/security for weapons and valuables. T & T is recommended for a fine dining experience (LOL)!</Text></record>

<Text>Got my first safe here and it is great. Installers did a fantastic job installing it.

Only gripe is first mutual credit was a pain to get to take my first two payments but that isn't T&T fault.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80ea4290c2f823e3:0xaf9fb3de4b1d0c25<//gmap_id></record>

<review>My mom and I have been coming here for over 10 +years. The view has always been to die for but lately it has become grungy and poorly taken care of. There were 5 seated tables total while we were there and our eggs and potatoes came out cold. Our bacon was soggy after asking for it crisp. They then brought back new bacon that was literally black and inedible. We love this place. We will always come and support their bakery but we will not be going for lunch or breakfast anytime soon. Absolute waste of money.
The downstairs seating next to the dumpsters looks downright disgusting. Really hoping they make some improvements because it seems like they just don’t care anymore 😞< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Stumbled across the place while in the area, and had the whole inside to ourselves. Everything we were served was amazing, and some of the items were cheaper than what we pay at a generic restaurant back in my city, though it tasted ten times better. They make different desserts daily and brought out a whole platter of their items when we asked for a dessert menu. It’s cute and has great views!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgN4vfYc7e6BMn3DVrIoCOab06TtBkYW_nDa1v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Very good food. We sat outside with a heater and it was a wonderful view as well. There’s wonderful bread with a house-made herb like butter to start. We shared a bottle of the Sauvignon Blanc, got the seafood platter, shared the lobster bisque, my fiancé got the salmon salad, and I got the rack of lamb. My rack of lamb was a bit over cooked, but they made me another one right away. They were overly kind about it. I don’t normally ask to get this remade, but I did this time due to the price point and the fact that it was my first time having lamb lollipop (I didn’t eat meat for a very long time). We didn’t have any dessert, despite French pastries being my favorite type of dessert. Definitely recommend!<//Review>

<review>Waterfront.  Nice ambiance. Greeters & Servers are friendly. Food are good. Perfect for brunch or even just coffee time for dessert. Will be coming back for sure. The only reason why I knocked down 1 star was no social distancing amid covid19, the tables were too closed to each other where there were barely room for people to pass by. Otherwise it's perfect.< /review>< Pics>

Truly spectacular experience.  Wonderful culinary experience (100 times better than in Paris). Friendly and great service. Breathtaking views. Had the opportunity to watch beatifull sunset over Laguna beach. Dinner was also excellent,  the seafood crape,  lobster 🦞 bisque was very good and one of the best Tiramisu I ever had. This is one of kind experience I'll remember for rest of my life. It made my business trip to  South  CA worthwhile.
Update,  looks like I will be coming back in few months and I'm looking forward visiting C'est La  Vie.</Text>

The food, vibe and customer service was mediocre and I do not recommend.

I want to praise the great customer service and attention that server Alex gave us while there.
At the same time, I would like to condemn the actions and attitude of the server named Justin.

My boyfriend and I sat ourselves and the whole time we were there, Justin who was supposed to be the "assigned" server, NEVER checked on us, brought us anything, or took our order.

Instead, we were served and attended by Alex. While Alex was serving me, I hear Justin calling out to him in a condescending manner and ordering him around while Alex was busy attending other guests. This was very rude and disrespectful to do in front of customers.

The whole time we were there, I overheard Justin tell other guests multiple times how he was glad that he had a server to help (referring to Alex), as if Justin was Alex's master. Very rude and unprofessional.

At the end, I went up to the owner named Jose and explained to him the situation to which all I heard from him was a "thank you and sorry for the inconvenience". His response wasn't that of an understanding employer but more of an annoyed boss that isn't planning on taking actions to correct the situation.

Overall, this placed has a toxic work environment and I feel bad for the good workers that have to put up with it.

I gave this place a shot but will never be coming back and I hope it shuts down.< /Text>

<review>This restaurant is my number one restaurant.  Of all restaurants I know I favor it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to this restaurant. Whenever  I I need a proper supper, this is the place that comes first to my head.  Great and   food and a rich cuisine.great team, and nice ambience. In addition to that, the cost is affordable. I sent my friends to this restaurant with no hesitation.</review>< Pics>

The lunch atmosphere was pleasant and the ocean view patio made dining so much more relaxing. All of our food was very good, flavorful, and had a good presentation. The service was okay, could have been better. The lady at the dessert counter was NOT pleasant at all. She was short with me and I did not feel welcome at all, as I was trying to purchase an item like everyone else there. When I walked over to be with my party, she got in my face (assuming I was not with them) and said 'yeah...' I then simply stated, this is my husband ( a white man, and I am Black/multiracial) and though she might not have expected that, it was unprofessional for her to make assumptions because all people should be treated the same.

Our waiter was fine, but seemed overwhelmed and it took a long time to get the check. The lemons requested took a long time as well, but again the view made the time pass quicker so there were no complaints. I feel my rating is mostly effected by my initial experience with the lady working the pastries. I had a 10% Yelp discount, that they honored, but I went ahead and tipped on the higher amount. So the long and short--the food might be good but if people are treated poorly,for whatever the reason it may be, the entire experience is ruined.< /text>

Terrible service, did not receive bread when asked, and server missed a substitution, then when the bill was questioned, received a bad attitude, when ordering more mimosas,  after our coffees, got a big time bad look as we were putting an additional burden on her....bathrooms were filthy. Used to be my wife's and I favorite place, now won't go back.<//Text>

This is my favorite place for a great medium rare prime rib.  I'm a huge fan of this city classic and I really wouldn't choose another place for a prime rib.  The sides are pretty good and their wine selection is pretty decent.  Definately in line with their old-school tone.  Great place for a date or dining w/ friends or the folks... even on those last minute prime rib craves, the bar dining always hits the spot.  The staff is friendly and take care of their patrons very well.  And I cannot forget to mention that their drinks are nice and strong.. so if you like that kick in your cocktails... this place is it and I hope to see anyone reading this there!</review>

Loved this place. The atmosphere is great. The service was phenomenal 😊. Been there twice and it's always a great experience. Best deserts I have ever had. Plus food is amazing. The view to die for overlooking water up in the balcony.<//review>

11/27/20 4:40pm Friday
Like 2 other families dining inside.

Around $23 for Salmon Salad that i got.
Salmon was good and salad was a salad. Fresh salad nothing especial about it but it was ok. (I dont really like olives so i left a happy face with them at the end. 😄)

So Larry attended me right away and i sat outside because i chose so.
They brought me those delicious bread with side of butter.
Few minutes later they brought the salmon salad.< /Review>

Pastries were bad and the experience and service was extremely off-putting.

We asked a waiter if we could sit in the mostly empty restaurant after ordering pastries from the bakery — the waiter said choose any table. After ordering, we went to sit down and a woman comes out yelling at us, telling us to sit at this small table section by the street. I explained that the waiter had told us we could pick a table and the woman responded “I would know where you can sit, I’m the owner.”

There’s a polite way to ask people not to sit somewhere, but this was just aggressive and demeaning. It felt like I was being angrily shamed for having a simple misunderstanding.

The cheesecake was also pretty terrible. It was greasy and had an almost grainy texture.</text>

Cute place right on the water. We were not satisfied with the server as it took him over 10 minutes to grab us water for the table. The service was very slow, but there were not many people there so we were surprised by this. The benefit is that you do have ocean view while eating. The calamari was not the best and niether was the crab cakes. The group of 4 of us would probably not go back.<//text>

I'm a huge fan of this city classic and I really wouldn't choose another place for a prime rib.  The sides are pretty good and their wine selection is pretty decent.  Definately in line with their old-school tone.  Great place for a date or dining w/ friends or the folks... even on those last minute prime rib craves, the bar dining always hits the spot.  The staff is friendly and take care of their patrons very well.  And I cannot forget to mention that their drinks are nice and strong.. so if you like that kick in your cocktails... this place is it and I hope to see anyone reading this there!<//Review><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

I LOVED the food! The seafood crepes was so tasty and the shrimp mixed with the lobster sauce actually MELTS in your mouth. They also have some fantastic macarons. My favorites was the earl black grey for sure. There's also a beautiful outdoor area that gives you a great view of the beach. Perfect for a beach date or a family visit.</text>

Complimentary mimosa/champagne when you order Sunday brunch. Great French ambiance with a view of the ocean.
Free parking behind the restaurant!!!

Highly recommend the French onion soup.< /text>

Turns out I didn't pick the correct Paris breakfast meal. I forgot the explanation the waitress gave me but turns out there's 2 Paris name meals. Why would you name 2 meals with the same name? I didn't even point to the menu, I just asked for the Paris breakfast, waitress didn't ask me to clarify which one. Though they did adjust the charge. Service is great here. But food is not so good..... They gave me stale 4 leaves of greens and a think sliced watermelon left out for a time. Sausage link was not hot... As if they didn't cook it enough.

We loved sitting by the window in this little French restaurant. Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.<//Text>

Very good food! Porkchops and rib eye steak was fabulous! Server's seem to not know what the happy hour & food specials are that are posted just outside the restaurant. One said it was just Mon-Fri, another said its for inside dining only (we were outside on the balcony) The manager was very nice & apologized & made sure we were properly taken care of.</review>

<review>Streetside appeal beacons one come hither.
Entry dessert display and sales counter are the hook.
Decor, atmosphere, flow of table seating and bar area are the line leading you to the Oceanside deck where continued decor and atmosphere are the sinker.
I'm in!

Host, server, owner were all attentive and friendly.
Menu is extensive.
Quiche was to die for. Gorgeous. Flavorful. not America's typical shaken and stirred pie. This was layers of whole spinach, fresh sauteed mushrooms topped with gooey thickness of cheese resting in a no-crumb-left-behind pie crust.

Husband's burger on toasted brioche was perfection.

The dessert tray was successful at inviting to even the most full stomachs to eat just a little bit more our selections were tough, dry, weak flavor.

I liked C'est La Vie so much that I feel bad giving a review of less than 5 stars.
We vacationed in Laguna Beach. I feel familiarity with a restaurant and therefore, reviews need to be based on more than one meal.

A must go.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMssSbSqsmx2nmWuWvYa8L8iMFUoDIn7Ea8d1Dv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxTVQW69x1YBswpqp1Yc-43mioN5c74Ow0ygF_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBW-79dFDt4dN9oF5S1-CNKTDnaxfzfmyzpIGX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhiFmBuFca8vyTAcGOgqgFPFaeBZqEXisPFspP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaIYkgY_1-B9dVEDmMjwXPK9C48XVsYOw584J6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnTSX8XJHYob7Ja9tQN4KJoon6FGBShR9heIDf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTiIUfeXHVbvqOjuC7Y5W5wxWysMExivNCPcj4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcBpGW9xJC6jz_iPSyBKzzsEizyrWYmOppcG1o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQN8w2lYz_hBiwbhbLtjhCiy0V2fOdJ20EDVQW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9tJowoM0D9D1JW6GW2DuQZyExLgqUPo7lCC-m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt-j4i2P90xeeFhKm7w8y0nrpFsUawo72D7im2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCChA1rQBJtX2aHxHn4O0kJiMvbm4B3ojRcLGz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsPGZdHEilrNJWh47TajL_kjQRKCo-xgeIwGpK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This place is doubtless one of the most pleasant place in the region. Whenever I go there I am extremely pleased. They keep their very high  standard service and the highest level of dishes  they give. You always win with this place. Very  recommended.< /Text>

<Text>Good food and portions, good drinks, and best desserts. And great staff.

Inside diners be warned: the management has the upstairs tables too close for effective social distancing, and management does not enforce nose and mouth coverings when patrons walk around inside. I wish the management placed a higher value on CDC guidelines for those of us trying to stay well and not catch CV-19 from inadequate table separation and patrons who put others at risk from not covering their nose and mouth when maintaining 6 feet separation is not likely.</Text>< user>

<text>I am a carnivore by nature but I limit myself to only the best places for a good steak everyone now and then.  This place definitely made my list - I had the bone in rib eye, OMG it was flavorful and just melted in your mouth.  The magical mushrooms were also very good and a good side dish with the steak.  Other very notable favorites were the Tuna tartar, Shrimp appetizer and the mac and cheese, all were amazing.<//text>< username>

Very good food! Porkchops and rib eye steak was fabulous! Server's seem to not know what the happy hour & food specials are that are posted just outside the restaurant. One said it was just Mon-Fri, another said its for inside dining only (we were outside on the balcony) The manager was very nice & apologized & made sure we were properly taken care of.< /Review>

two days ago was our first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is obviously not the last time. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the efficient service, with the high quality  dishes and fine drinks and with the honest pay. We will definitely return there again.</Review>

Only been there once but was immediately impressed. C'est La Vie with goat cheese was extremely delicious and the corn bread (with chilli) is a must-have item. If you have scramble egg, order Smoked whiskey fennel sausage, mushroom, baby spinach scramble. I was very happy with it.< /text>

<Review>The menu is amazing. You'll find a ton of truly authentic French delicacies like the Monte Cristo, savory and sweet crepes, and quiche. The house special crepes were good but didn't come with any sides. The Monte Crispy, French onion soup, and ham & cheese croissant were perfect. The smoked salmon and avocado Benedict was just ok. All the textures and flavors mushed together. The only place you want to sit is outside on the balcony overlooking the ocean. They also have a great bakery. Coffee is also high quality. Downsides are parking and price. That's what you get when you eat near the beach though.< /Review><UserId.>106762625288133908921< /UserId.>< rate>

<rating>1< /rating><text>HORRIBLE MANAGER (whoever was manager 12/22/20 at 330pm)we drove in from out of town to eat here with reservations at 330pm. The manager told me we close at 4pm and we can’t seat you. I told him we have reservations and we tried calling and it was disconnected. Said there’s nothing they can do. It’s a shame that you have someone like this leading your staff we WILL NEVER come back due to this man.</text>< pics>

You really pay for the views of the beach. One piece of fancy dessert is $11. Coffee is $5. I had the pear walnut tart. That was probably my first time eating a dessert at a French restaurant. If that's how a French dessert tastes like, then I'll probably never eat it again. The pear walnut tart tastes too sugary. The tart was placed over dashes of chocolate and cherry syrup on a plate, like what you see in fancy restaurants. I have a tongue that favors natural tastes and refuses refined sugary food. I didn't like the tart. The coffee was obviously been out for a while, not fresh, not hot.</text>

<Text>Nice french restaurant in this chic Laguna beach area.
There is a bakery up front and seating inside as well as on the patio.
I recommend the patio seating for some amazing views of the ocean!
The food was pretty good, the service was good - the dessert was absolutely divine. Especially the macaroons.</Text>< Pictures>

<time>1609163696330< /time><review>DO NOT GO HERE. HORRIBLE SERVICE. NOT COVID SAFE. I came here 12/20/20 at around 4pm and ordered a takeout order and the manager took my order. The server still brought my order on open plates without a mask on. I asked politely asked if they could redo the order as takeout instead and the manager refused. His attitude was immature and disgusting! He made a scene in front of everyone and staff!! He told me that I could either accept the order on the disgusting plates that were served without a mask and NOT covid safe or not be served at all. I told him how my family had driven almost 2 hours just to come here and he was so RUDE. I asked if they could at least make the rest of the order that was not brought out yet to go and he said that I had to accept the WHOLE order or not be served at all. I basically had to runafter him to ask for a refund after paying almost 100 dollars for an order I was not getting. He avoided me and pretended to he serving other customers and made me wait in line AGAIN to ask for a refund. We had come here to celebrate my birthday and this really ruined the whole day. It was a horrible experience and I will NEVER come here again or recommend this place to anyone!< /review>< user_name>

Great location, high quality foods. The main course menu selection is a bit limited but they have a good variety of french desserts. They bring you the available dessert options in a tray (as shown in the photo) and you order what you like.< /text>

Wonderful dinner - the highlight meal of our week in Cali.  I totally enjoyed the Cajun Linguini dish (flavorful!) and my wife loved her seafood fettuccini (very fresh!). Waiter Ali was as fantastic as the sunset we watched as we sat outside looking over the beach. A+<//Review>

It sits very close to the sidewalk of the beach with good views at the patio back there. While the breeze from the seashore came to air massage , we enjoyed our little dessert time  with the Italian iced coffee and yammy taste of tiramisu cake (solid and modest sweet).
A bit of high roller bill next to the beach, of course, at least we felt welcome and easy going from the young gentleman host with his good attention and service.</Text>

Food was good. The reason for the one star is I got home and noticed they added their own tip. Be careful when eating her and check your bank. Apparently they believe in adding their own tip. Strongly disappointed and definitely won’t be returning<//Text>

<userid>102542073619206111217< /userid><Review>Had dinner at C’est La Vie on Friday September 18 and was extremely disappointed. We started with the stuffed mushrooms that were cold and unappetizing. Next the French Onion soup, when delivered the cheese had harden on top and the soup was lukewarm. The crepe was as thick as a pancake and the seafood in the crepe was sparse. The only good thing about the meal was the scenery. Watching the sunset was the highlight of the meal. Since we did not eat any of the mushrooms and very little of our meal we purchased delicious macaroons on our way out. So go to C’est La Vie to watch the sunset and the macaroons.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Food was good. The reason for the one star is I got home and noticed they added their own tip. Be careful when eating her and check your bank. Apparently they believe in adding their own tip. Strongly disappointed and definitely won’t be returning<//Text>

<Text>Had dinner at C’est La Vie on Friday September 18 and was extremely disappointed. We started with the stuffed mushrooms that were cold and unappetizing. Next the French Onion soup, when delivered the cheese had harden on top and the soup was lukewarm. The crepe was as thick as a pancake and the seafood in the crepe was sparse. The only good thing about the meal was the scenery. Watching the sunset was the highlight of the meal. Since we did not eat any of the mushrooms and very little of our meal we purchased delicious macaroons on our way out. So go to C’est La Vie to watch the sunset and the macaroons.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We loved sitting by the window in this little French restaurant. Wasn’t crowded at all on a Sunday night, and the service was quick. They have awesome dinner specials between 4 and 6 PM. We ordered the salmon sauvage and it was tasty. Salmon was so tender and the sauce was excellent. The veggies could have been more tender. Complimentary French bread before the meal was good, and they gave us more than enough for two.

We also ordered their chocolate bomb dessert to go- so good! Chocolate mouse filling inside a chocolate shell. The whipped cream on top was too hardened, so we ended up scraping it off. We would come back here again.< /Text>

< review>
It could be that they are having a hard time with the outdoor only situation but this place is terrible...

There were only about 25 customers total (vs probably 100 capacity in normal times).
It took 30 minutes to get served: fish tacos and a burger...
Glasses were not clean, theY smelled previous guests drinks (Sprite/ Coke)
Fish taste was awful
Burger was very average
French fries were almost raw

Oh and what is French in this restaurant ? They advertise crepes and quiches. Nowhere to be found.

I hate to say this because I know times are rough for businesses but if you care about food quality then avoid this place.<//review>

while this place is not vegan, the chef will work with you to make your experience memorable. We came as a group and, given the French theme, I had little expectations for a vegan menu. I planned on grabbing a drink and perhaps a salad; they offered a large plate of sauteed seasonal vegetables which were done beautifully. The rest of the group was more than happy with the menu selection and the varieties of pastries offered from the in-house bakery.  The deck overlooking the water is one of the best in the area. This is a great place for a birthday or celebration and it lacks the pretentiousness that would normally be associated with a restaurant with a location. The owner is very personable and involved. Faredeh checked in often to see if everything was OK (given the search for vegan options). She was awesome!  I'll certainly be back</Text>

<review>Mediocre food, fries were cold, spinach was undercooked and the tuna in the salad Nicoise was of an interesting cut. Onion soup had a strong tomato flavor (I’m sure they used tomato paste to help quicken prep). The bread was good.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Awesome location with a nice 2nd floor patio overlooking the beach.  All of the servers were very friendly however the food was only average.  We had crepes, French toast, and a chorizo burrito. Not bad just nothing special. In fairness we did try the bakery or desert items which looked amazing.<//Review>< gmapID>

Kind of place you might overlook as it was in the middle of block of small shops on a busy street.  Definitely recommend, especially if you're getting tired of the same old menus! Crepes and quiche were our choices, although they did offer the normal burgers, sandwiches, and salads.  Desert is a must, but we took ours to go, as we were already full.  Extraordinary selection of tarts, macaroons, pudding bars, carrot cake, you might just want to stop for one of them and a good cup of coffee or ice tea.</Text>< pics>

Their 4 to 6 pm menu special has a nice variety to choose from. I had the 6 oz filet mignon, served on roasted potatoes and asparagus with a cabernet demi sauce. It was wonderful! The view of Laguna's main beach from the upstairs patio was lovely. Decided to splurge and shared a warm, delicious peach tart with my husband. It had a side of the best vanilla bean ice cream I've had in ages. I'd go back in a heartbeat.<//Text>

<text>This is one of my top favorite spots in Laguna Beach.  They are a bit understated it seems as they have a LOT to offer. The food is excellent, perfectly prepared. The deserts are wonderful,  large portions, and MANY choices. Large dining area as well as a bar and a patio. Get the Filet with Blue Cheese crumbles and Cab reduction sauce!<//text>< pics>

I love it here. Not as pretentious as many popular Laguna spots. It's got a wonderful rooftop patio with a great view of main beach. The food has never let us down, the drinks are great. The prices a touch high and the service is just okay...but I absolutely love going and sitting outside. You cant go wrong with the breakfast menu, but I also highly recommend the salmon/rice.< /text>

<Text>The food and dessert was great, and the staff was wonderful. It seemed that the staff was a bit over-worked or something, though, because we waited a very long time for our food on a Thursday night, and we had to ask for things like tea or dessert multiple times before we got them. Aside from the delays, we had a wonderful time with a beautiful view and great food.<//Text>< Pictures>

Went for New Years day lunch because Nick's had a two hour wait.  Waiting for about ten minutes until we motioned someone over for drinks.  The cocktails we had were the highlight of the trip.  The $20 burger we had was dry.  Asked server for ketchup, luckily the table next to us had some from the last group and was nice enough to hand it over after hearing our frustration.  We never got any ketchup, server probably noticed that our neighbors gave us some.  Fish and chips was average.  The pistachio macaroon was also very well done, rest were ok.  It was $85 for the whole meal for three after two drinks and dessert with two $20 mains.< /text>

As French food lovers, my husband an I almost never avoid an opportunity to try a new place in town. I had a great salmon dish with my man the other day and my husband had lobster and a soup. Great service, great coffee and a fresh menu with daily eats price point. We'll definitely be back when in the area.<//text>

<text>As French food lovers, my husband an I almost never avoid an opportunity to try a new place in town. I had a great salmon dish with my man the other day and my husband had lobster and a soup. Great service, great coffee and a fresh menu with daily eats price point. We'll definitely be back when in the area.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>The food was great. Highly recommend the Seafood fetuccine.... They were the best.
Dessert menu was great too.  Lot is options, and you can pick the menu from s tray they bring to your table!!!

When I think of breakfast or brunch in Laguna Beach, I think of C'est La Vie.  The staff is great, and the food is too!  Earth cafe is too trendy, with long wait times for so-so food.  Try C'est La Vie.  You won't regret it!<//review>

<review>This place is definitely a disappointment. Besides the nice server who said has been working for only 4days, everything else was awful. Bread pudding was like a brick on a plate(a cold brick) crepe was so bad you’d gag. Omelet was mediocre. So basically Gordon Ramsay would’ve yelled at the owner and made the restaurant shut down it’s doors for good!!!!oh btw we were there celebrating a birthday!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>The view was awesome! I enjoyed sipping on a latte on the balcony while waiting for our food. The espresso is Lavazza which was very good! They also had milk alternatives. The milk froth was not spectacular but it was acceptable.

As far the food goes it was alright. Nothing out of this world but not bad. We both had omelettes. The bakery items looked great but we were too full to try them.

What is worth raving about is the service! We went in at around 11am on a Wednesday and were served right away. Our server was Justin. He was super friendly and made us feel like a local.

We would go back for the views and the great service.< /Text>< Pics>

Smelled faintly like vomit when we first arrived, which set the stage. Waiter was very rushed, didn't really listen, forgot the drink orders, as well as parts of the food order. Salad was completely wilted and old. The rest of the food was very good. Other patrons were loud and rude, like it was a dive bar. Laguna has changed, and NOT for the better.</Review>

The view from the upstairs terrace here is magnificent. If you're looking for a nice place to have lunch and see the ocean on a pretty day, it's hard to beat. My seafood quiche wasn't quite as spectacular as the veiw. The crust was overcooked and tough, and the filling, although pretty good, wasn't particularly flavorful. The salad that came with it was very nice, but quite dry, to the point where I needed to request extra dressing. It's hard for me to say how much of this was due to the particular day that I went there vs how much is just the way the restaurant chefs prepare the food. I would definitely give this place another go!<//Text>

Some weird American-PseudoFrench fusion, neither here nor there. On top of that overpriced - most likely due to the view and location, which is actually great.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

So sorry, but the breakfast here was horrible.  From the runny, almost raw eggs (I ordered over medium) to the breakfast potatoes (they simply slice them into full size medallions and throw them in the deep fryer) that tasted like the oil hadn’t been changed in months, and there was “other” food flavor in the grease as well.  My wife’s omelette was over cooked and rubbery she said.  Oh, and here’s a tip to the “cooks” in the kitchen, people REALLY like small, chopped up ingredients in their omelettes, not giant pieces.  Is it really that hard to find a good breakfast restaurant in Laguna Beach???  Sadly, we will not be back :(<//text>

Reservations and getting there early for finding parking in case their lot is full is a must. It's all worth it when you are served. Everyone enjoyed both the appetizers and their entree choices! Excellent! We had great service and will be back.</text>

Not typical for me to post a moderate review... without a doubt the best this restaurant has going is it's beach front location...just beautiful...food was average (again, I'm easily pleased), and service was poor...
Given Laguna Beach, prices reflected that (pricy for lunch anyway (e.g. $22 for a turkey and avocado sandwich)) but still not a connect with the poor quality food and poor service).
Just trying to be honest for future tourists trying to save a few vacation dollars...< /Text>

Had a scrumptious strawberry tart pastry (the crust was like something you dream about) and a large latte...
C'est parfait! Great views from their location by Main Beach.  I would definitely try the Happy Hour specials next time. Of course the Real Housewives of Orange County film here...it's just so French!</review>

This place has a French themed but you can order from a variety on the menu. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting to start; add Faredeh to the mix and you will feel right at home. This sort of personal involvement and care from the owner is rare in the restaurant experience these days! If you are a fan of French Bakeries, be prepared. you are greeted with some amazing pastries the moment you walk in. Just beyond that is the dining area with some great window seating for some world class people watching. There is a small and intimate bar reminiscent of an old world experience. If you are looking for a view, the deck overlooking the ocean is a highlight worth the trip in itself.  Wine selection is decent and their prices are very reasonable given the setting. This is a great place to start a day or wind down in the evening. The central location is perfect for either a beach day or a day exploring the shops and studios. TIP: There are a few parking spaces out back if you are fortunate enough to get one while it's empty< /text>

Atmosphere was nice and quaint. Tried the special,  Lobster Eggs Benedict, but was more interested in the cheese and fruit platter. The special had a good portion size. Waiter was nice and informative,  but disorganized with seating.<//Review>

<review>Omg where should I start.... my last night in Laguna my husband and I decided to go here for dinner. We sat at our dirty table for 10 minutes until someone came out of no where with water. After waiting an additional 10 minutes  and wiping the table clean a server came and we specifically ordered the special which was $21.99 for lobster tail and $16.95 for the pork chop. My drink (frozen margarita) was watered down so I asked would they make it over but on the rocks. Not only did they try to charge me for 2 drinks they charged us regular price for the food. We ask them to please change the ticket and they did. After paying and no tip I asked  the manager could I purchase more deserts he said sure to purchase them from the pastry area.... the waiter comes up and asked me why didn’t he get a tip I ask for the manager and he was so rude.... and there was this other idiot trying to gang up on us saying little stupid stuff all the while the waiter is smiling.... I see why this place was empty the entire time I was in Laguna beach. Visit this place at your own risk! And the reason we didn’t tip is because it took them 10 minutes to serve us they stood around talking.... unacceptable</review>< Pictures>

<review>We sat down by a table, because the sign said seat yourself, then no one came to take our order cause apparently we sat by “ waiting tables” ( there were menus and bottles of water) After figuring out how we can get served and moving to an actual table, we got very dry pastries that each costed $12. Complete lack of management and quality control.< /review></record>

Beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the ocean. Unfortunately the food was meh. My entree came out cold; both times. I couldn't be bothered to send it back a 2nd time. My husband's also came out at room temperature...not even warm. Way too pricey of a breakfast for sub par food.< /Text>

<Text>Terrible, nasty , unprofessional place everything was dirty had to clean our own table. Waited too long for just four people in their dining second sign that we should have left. Extremely poor management making their employees beg and cry for more tip even chase after you once you’ve left. Confronted manger which clearly doesn’t understand customer service gave him a few lessons then decided to walk away from the conversation. Terrible location you want good service don’t spend your hard earned money here. No wonder this place never has customers.< /Text>< Resp>

<text>I've visited this restaurant since the late 1980's, about 30 years.
Since I live in the San Gabriel Valley, I usually go every few months or years.
The dishes that I have ordered have been good or excellent, 4 to 5 stars.  The service used to be very good, but now it is lacking.
That is why I rated it 3 stars.

I went on 11/10/18.  There is a sign which says to seat yourself.
I sat on the patio and picked up a menu that was already on the table.  Someone greeted me at the table and said that he would send a waiter. I was waiting for quite a while (didn't time it, but too long).  I noticed a couple arrived, sat down, and a waiter immediately went to their table and took their order.  He was tall, had an accent and was left-handed, which I noticed because I'm also a lefty.  I say this so that perhaps a manager reading this will identify him and speak to him in order to improve.
I almost walked out, but another waiter came to serve me.  Perhaps because I was alone, they thought I wasn't as important to serve.  A couple of years ago, I also received inferior service to those around me, I feel because I was alone.  This wasn't the case many years ago.

As far as the food, the Sea Bass with chipotle sauce that I had  was excellent.  However, to make the experience enjoyable, as it should be,
the service needs major improvement.
Other reviewers have stated this need just recently on Trip Advisor, etc.
The management should take note and make improvements.</text>< gmapID>

Good selection of food. Fresh bread. Good service. One of the managers, Ferry or something like that, can't stop touching her face and nose and then touching the plates and catchup/hot sauce bottles. Very unhygienic. Though we enjoyed the restaurant, her touching the plates and general unfriendly attitude took away from the experience.</text>

<review>We walked in by chance after finding a parking spot in front of their shop. Went in for a drink and was met with a VERY knowledgeable & capable bar tender named Steven! Over the next few hours we ate some of the tastiest garlic bread and down right delectable mixed drinks! Steven knows his trade well! We enjoyed our visit and atmosphere so much we went back the next night. We were again greeted by kind staff and had the lobster bisque soup among other appetizers. FABULOUS! VERY positive experience here!!< /review>< pics>

We sat on their Patio for breakfast on Sunday. The place was NOT busy, but 10 min after we sat down, we still didn’t have menus. My wife asked a waiter if we could have a menu, but he just kept walking.
Another waiter walked by and I asked.
He kept walking as well. I got up and he turned and told me that they’ll bring us menu as soon as they can.
They were rude and disrespectful. We just got up and had breakfast at Moulin. Much better choice, and actually French.< /Review>

<Review>French type menu with good crepes, both savory and sweet. Salade Nicoise was good but obviously made by someone who might not have ever had one. It had a tasty but not Nicoise dressing among other faux pas. Fresh tuna was nicely seared but coated with some awful seasoning. Mojito had plenty of mint but NO rum! Service was good and ocean/beach views were pleasant.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>View is amazing, but unfortunately the food isnt that great. They forgot to add any dressing to our salad, and it didnt even taste good. Burger came in toast bread, and peach tart was dense, dry, and all the possible opposite pronouns of what a custard should taste like. Even the coffee we ordered was cold. So I’m not sure if its just a place to get juices/cold drinks.< /Review>< Date>

<text>OK food, good service beautiful view.
Tim/ James was awesome. The mimosa was better than bloody Mary. We've had several variations of egg Benedict, they were all just average. Pastries were fresh.

I was very impressed with C'est La Vie. The restaurant is very charming with the upstairs outside patio and view of the ocean.  We arrived just in time for happy hour.  Service was great. The bartender/waiter Tony was very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about wines.  We had a great time and looking forward to coming back soon.< /text>

First impression was a very cute and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. But the hostess and the busser were arguing about where my boyfriend and I should be seated. They were both telling us to sit at different tables.

The food wasn't absolutely terrible. I'm sure the crepes are good. But I didn't get a crepe. I ordered an omelette. It was supposed to be a southwestern-style spicy omelette, but what they brought me was the avocado and bacon omelette. Which I didn't really complain about because I was actually considering ordering that one, but it was very undercooked and watery inside. It was pretty gross. It was also confusing because two different people came to take our order at different times. The iced mocha was okay, but a little chalky.

What I did love was the violin guy walking around the dining room. He stopped at our table and played for a long time. Which was sweet and kinda romantic-y, but I guess we just weren't really sure how to act (should we just watch him play and smile, continue talking to each other, etc.) or if it was appropriate to tip him.

Overall it was a bit of a disappoinment and we felt a little like we had wasted our time and money 🙁 It probably could have been better, but that wasn't our experience.</Text>

Great food and amazing service. Manuel was one of the best, if not the best, waiters I have ever had. It was cold outside so I asked for the half of my soup I had not eaten to be heated up. He brought me a brand new soup. The crepes are incredible!</Text>

< review>
I was visiting my friend in Alico Viejo.  Yesterday, April 16, we went to this restaurant that she liked before.    Place is nice, bakery look wonderful.  I am vegetarian and new that French restaurants are not really vegetarian friendly.  but place looked nice and we decided to give it a shot.  In a FEW minutes waiter approached us and before we looked at food menu I asked about sweets, in case we like it and have something with wine instead of meal.  he quickly brought us sample tray, which looked amazing, but unfortunately most of the dessert had jello glazing on it and we said its OK we do not want it.  HE Disappeared  for at least 7 minutes.  we started looked around and waived for attention, when other person noticed that and asked our waiter if those ladies are needing an attention. "no, - he said - they asked for more time".  WE NEVER DID.  He got back to our table.  we asked for a salad and wine.  He DISAPPEARED for another 8 minutes, NO WINE, NO WATER FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES OF WAITING.  WE ARE RUSSIAN AND SPEAK WITH ACCENT.  IS THAT WHAT HE DID NOT LIKE?  WE LEFT.
THE ONLY THING I REGRET THAT I DID NOT GIVE HIM A TIP FOR HIS SERVICE: A PENNY THAT HE DESERVES.
I am not going to blame everybody in this restaurant, but one stinking rut that walls into honey barrel spoils it all.
I have plans to move to this area and hope this place will have friendlier attitude< /review>

I visited this place for take out on 14th July 2019. There were only two people in front of me, but it took over 10 minutes to get served. But, to be fair, the guy was on his own most of that time and one of the customers was a pain.

I thought $17.50 for two chocolate croissants and two cronuts was a bit expensive.  However, they were tasty and I've wanted to try a cronut for a long time.</text>

<review>First impression was a very cute and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. But the hostess and the busser were arguing about where my boyfriend and I should be seated. They were both telling us to sit at different tables.

The food wasn't absolutely terrible. I'm sure the crepes are good. But I didn't get a crepe. I ordered an omelette. It was supposed to be a southwestern-style spicy omelette, but what they brought me was the avocado and bacon omelette. Which I didn't really complain about because I was actually considering ordering that one, but it was very undercooked and watery inside. It was pretty gross. It was also confusing because two different people came to take our order at different times. The iced mocha was okay, but a little chalky.

What I did love was the violin guy walking around the dining room. He stopped at our table and played for a long time. Which was sweet and kinda romantic-y, but I guess we just weren't really sure how to act (should we just watch him play and smile, continue talking to each other, etc.) or if it was appropriate to tip him.

Overall it was a bit of a disappoinment and we felt a little like we had wasted our time and money 🙁 It probably could have been better, but that wasn't our experience.<//review>< username>

<Text>I love Laguna Beach and all the fun places to eat, but this is one stop I suggest you walk past.
The food is mediocre. Most of it was either pre-made earlier that day or was once frozen or canned. Nothing seemed fresh, and the prices are ridiculous considering what you get. I expected way more from a place that charged $18 for a burger and toted themselves as a "French Bistro".

Even their desserts were brought in from somewhere else.

The only thing that saved them a star was the super friendly hostess, or possible manager, who was super friendly. You could tell she had a lot going on and she was a total rockstar running the restaurant side and jumping to the "bakery" side helping out where she could.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /gmapID>< UserId.>

Great food and amazing service. Manuel was one of the best, if not the best, waiters I have ever had. It was cold outside so I asked for the half of my soup I had not eaten to be heated up. He brought me a brand new soup. The crepes are incredible!< /text>

My husband and I went there for breakfast on Sunday 5/29/16. My husband ordered scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and I ordered crepe with scrambled eggs then we had cronuts for dessert. Everything was delicious and amazing. We loved the food, the seating and the service. People were nice and courteous even though it was busy. I asked for hot milk instead of half and half and the waiter brought it in minutes. Only thing I noticed they forgot to bring the bread in the beginning and the waiter apologized and brought it with the food.<//Review>

We came here with family for a late lunch. The boy at the bakery was very friendly and welcoming. We got seated. We decided to have a cup of coffee at the beginning and as they have a big coffee variety we asked servers couple questions. And.... He was so rude. My daughter asked what kind of drinks they have for kids and he  raised his voice on her and I couldnt believe my ears!!!! We never had this experience before! We left the menus, stood up and we left this terrible place! Not even tried their food. But looking to the reviews we did not missed anything!<//text>

<text>All the food was served cold, including my coffee (Cafe au Lait), in which I waited for hot milk which was served 10 mins later than the coffee- obviously the coffee got cold. It was the fourth of July but none of the other waiters seemed to have an issue, ours was MIA from the start- two other tables sat down after us and got waited on AND served first. Generally unacceptable for anywhere trying to convey an even slightly professional/upscale environment. Would not recommend to anyone.< /text><UserId.>117502507567485963014</UserId.><date>1562741097365<//date><Rating>1<//Rating><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02</gmapID><resp>None</resp>< Pictures>

It's a nice place for breakfast.  Nice view of the ocean from the patio seating.  The coffee is very good, which is very important for a breakfast place. They just have to do a better job on their croissants. It is a French cafe with croissants similar to a market packaged soft croissants. I suggest the owners try croissants at an Erewhon  market. Overall a good place to go. I go there often.< /Review>

<Text>my mother and I were looking for a place to eat that was by the ocean, and we figured that this place would be perfect! French cuisine, right by the ocean, what could be better? Wrong. Although the view was nice and the staff was competent, the food was terrible! Greasy, bland, and entirely underwhelming. I got the ratatouille crepe, and it was practically a plate of oil and some vegetables. This restaurant has an incredible location, wish they could step up their "French cuisine."< /Text>< pictures>

We had a credit voucher to use at this restaurant so we have it a shot one evening. The view from the upstairs patio is great, especially at sunset. Sadly that was best part of the evening. The food was good, however it was not great. And our server was slow. Three other tables were seated after we arrived and left before we had received our check. The staff is really friendly though, so if you are not in any rush, it could be ok. The deciding factor for us not to return was the price of the desserts. The macaroons are $2.45 each. Our desserts, chocolate cheesecake and a tiramisu we just under $12 each. Again, both were good, but not rave worthy.< /Text>

Lovely atmosphere to this French restaurant.  Outdoor seating with heat lamps warmed the cool desert evening  for a fantastic dining experience watching the sunset.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were a savory delight.

The waiter's service was excellent.< /Review>

A few years later I remembered this place when a friend of mine was getting married on the beach The manager was SO accommodating--she allowed me to come in  prior to the ceremony and reserve a long table with an amazing view. I brought in fresh flowers and place settings for each seat to surprise the couple and a small group of guests for their post ceremony dinner here. The manager was amazingly sweet and helpful, and from what I hear, the meal was superb. I never got to go back in and say thank you; I have since moved out of state. I will make it a point to eat here on my next visit to Laguna.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Overall, I have to tip my hat to C'est la Vie for putting on one stellar dining experience especially for my awesome friend's birthday.  From start to finish, they were on point from the get go.  The service was outstanding, the ambiance and décor was lovely.  The dishes were all incredible with everything tasting amazing.  It exceeded my expectations for sure.  100/10 says I will return.  Definitely worth the money!!  Make a reservation asap!!<//text>

I really enjoyed my dish of the pasta mamma. I thought it was light yet hearty in a delicious, satisfying way. There wasn't too much Alfredo sauce, there was the perfect amount of eggs, bacon and the tomatoes on top sealed the deal. Absolutely delicious.

I tried the banana foster crepe which was sweet and satisfying as well. The view if you choose outside seating is gorgeous and I enjoyed eying their decor.

What brought down the rating for this place was the waiter. I'd hate to put so much emphasis on the staff, because we're there to eat. However, I feel that waiters/waitresses/ hostesses do make a difference. In this case, it was our waiter. The host who helped us to our table was very sweet and polite upon arriving and departing.

For starters, the waiter did not supply us with any bread. Everyone around us received it, except us until we asked for it. He took our order, then later returned with our food. Now we were celebrating my friends birthday, who specifically told us we had to try her sweet potato fries when they arrived. She told us before she even ordered it, as she was the only one who had been to this establishment before. The waiter then appeared with the food and asked if everything looked okay. The birthday girl mentioned she had ordered sweet potato fries, not the fries she was given. He immediately got defensive and said "you said steak fries." She said okay it's alright I will eat them. He then asked if she would like potato fries and she said no thank you. She was clearly upset. He said "are you sure?" as if he was annoyed. I jumped in and said yes, she would like her sweet potato fries.

This in my opinion was unacceptable. This could've been easily labeled as a miscommunication and resolved. First, apologize to the customer and then politely inform them you will correct the order and bring them out as soon as possible. It's really not that hard. He was just a bad waiter over all and really brought down the mood.<//Text>

<text>Two good dishes on a Sunday diner.  But big mistake was NOT asking about specials.  Table over order what looked to be massive bone on rib-eye steaks.  Very jealous.  Next trip for sure to order.  My salmon grill was excellent.  Wifes dish was average - was to be spicy but really nothing and I believe they had wrong sort of sausage in the dish - polish vs italian which would have been better (garlic in polish overshadowed dish, whereas a chili-based italian would have sparked it -- IMHO).  Good overall.  BTW, servered hers dish on a large plate which should have been a bowl to keep temp up - front line should have caught mis-plating.  Oh well not Michelin star'd .</text><rating>4<//rating></record>

The eggs florentine are their best dish, wont vouge for anything else. I first ate here 14 years ago, the eggs florentine were really good, then for a while they were average. Last time I ate there a month ago they were the best ever! Cheers to the new chef. Service is sometimes slow, the views are amazing.  They're busy usually, it's in a prime location. Coffee is good too. They're nice people here.<//Review>

Great food, great views(sit up on the deck). Parking is a bit of a challenge, very limited. Suggest parking elsewhere and walking around to the shops and eating here.< /review>

Food is meh and overpriced, but you get an ocean view (mostly the back parking lot and the homeless, but the ocean nonetheless), but you must get there early morning and try the Cronuts!! Delicious!!</text>

<Review>Terrible experience. The meal took 25 minute from ordering time. They brought the wrong entree and it was grossly over cooked. The waiter told me that a large crow had come in after us and they had first priority. On exit, the manager  made a similar excuse. Terrible.< /Review>< user_name>

I have let everyone know in Laguna Beach about these con-artists who can not even cook. So so ill the next day all of our party were really sick with Staph poisoning and my daughter was one week in hospital vomiting her guts out. This is not in the least bit French. Our food was cold and microwaved prepackaged food made to look fancy. The taste was revolting. The management are not even French but Iranian Arabs.</Text>< user>

Absolutely one of Lagunas most beautiful dining experiences. I love the crepes when they are available. The only reason I went 4 instead of 5 stars is I have been there when they were busy and my meal was served cool. I will conclude that when they are on point the items I tried were remarkable.< /review>

<Text>I don't usually do restaurant reviews, but this place was truly terrible!!!! My friend and I were looking for a place to relax and to study. It was empty, and the busboy (who was very nice) told us we were welcome to have a cup of coffee and study since the restaurant was empty. The waiter, however, was very rude and made us feel extremely uncomfortable; he constantly tried to push us to buy more food and to buy alcoholic drinks, and then made snide remarks under his breath about us being cheap when we said no thank you. The food was terrible!!!! He gave us dry, stale bread, but the busboy was nice enough to get us something a little fresher. The food that we ordered was really salty and not very fresh looking, and the dipping sauces looked gross and smelled funky. Then he charged us $30 for a single appetizer and two coffees. We didn't even get a refill for our coffee because he left for a smoke break and was gone for a while. The menu said that the appetizer was only $10 and that the coffee was $3, but he said that was his "special" rate with a really mean smile. ***It is not worth the nice view to go here; please don't support these people after they bullied and ripped us off***</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< review>
We walked in and the place was almost empty (as if a warning sign). I didn't want to eat there, so we just checked out the bakery in front. All the desserts looked so appetizing and delectable, but to my mistake i was completely wrong. We asked the gentleman for the fruit tart and he said he would throw in a "free" slice of the cheesecake with that since we purchased the whole cake. i thought he was so kind for that until he came back with our change. the total turned out to be over $40 and he refused to give us a receipt. when we finally got some kind of slip of paper, he avoided us as we walked out angrily. we knew something sneaky was going on here. when we arrived home, the top layer of the cake was delicious, but once i tasted the bottom crust, it was so stale and just ruined my appetite. the cheesecake, however, was okay. i couldn't believe this had just happened, we got ripped off for a digusting dessert and i will never eat here again. DO NOT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!<//review>

<text>Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like. They looked around, like we did earlier, and chose the exact same table with ocean view. They were escorted to table. They were also a party of 2. They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?< /text>< pics>

Love this place the food is really good and the price really reasonable. The only thing I didn't like is the the tables and chairs are to crowded in out side. But other then that the food and staff are amazing.</Text>

Service was terrible. Chicken sandwich was cheap white bread and a thin layer of chicken breast. Salad came out with no dressing. Just pile of leaves on a plate next to a sub par chicken sandwich. Had to flag down a busboy to get the dressing for my salad. Server made up for it with free dessert, however, dessert was soggy and nasty. Expected A LOT more for the price.< /Review>

Not sure how to feel about this place. Arrived to an early Valentine's day dinner and were offered anywhere to sit by young man at bar. We chose a table with ocean view. We were told to please move to a smaller table adjacent to that table because the table by window was reserved for a larger party. We abided. Service was great by our server. Very attentive. Food was very good. We noticed during our meal, another couple came in and were told the same thing as us....they could sit anywhere they'd like.

They were not told to move (they didn't have reservation). I dont know why we were not allowed to stay at that table and they were. It was our 26th anniversary, chose this place over ALL our choices in Laguna. We chose to eat an early dinner to beat the crowds and maybe get an ocean view. We felt very uncomfortable during our meal because of this. Again, our server was awesome, the cioppino was great and we bought a few desserts at the front little bakery to take home, the young girl helping us was great. We actually ended up eating our cheesecake slice we bought there, instead of waiting till we got back to our hotel. Our server was gracious enough to bring us plates and forks. Just got a feeling we weren't very welcomed there by the way we were treated by that bartender/young man. We tried to still have a romantic dinner. Was a little difficult as we could hear the couple next to us admire the ocean view, that we had, out loud. Would have been a 5 star experience. How does one take that?<//review>

<text>I wish I could give them a negative star. We went there with the family on 01/01/2016. Seated almost immediately and decided to leave right after talking to the waiter. I didn't care about his stitches on his eyebrow or banged up face but his attitude and short answers and " I don't wanna be here" attitude was almost as disgusting as the restaurant. On the way out the manager or owner also pushed my daughter out of her way, saying "move"  she is lucky her face didn't end up matching the waiter. Don't waste ur time. Go somewhere else. Hopefully they close down or change management soon.</text>< Pics>

<Review>The food was great and the staffs are friendly. The restarant is super tiny and cute. But the price wasnt friendly. One chicken leg costs almost $ 30 dollars. Haha. But worth trying ! I highly recommend their onion soup! Four plates were charged over $100 not including the tip.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>One of my favorite spots for weekend brunch. It has a patio upstairs that overlooks Laguna Beach. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Their bread is delicious. I usually get the huevos rancheros, though it is a lot of food. They also have mojo potatoes with many of their breakfasts, which are yummy.

The bakery is also very good. I have not eaten here for dinner because it is quite expensive, but I imagine it's very good.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Warning: if you're looking for a place to get a fresh morning treat to eat with your coffee, look elsewhere. They don't open until 9:00, and don't have the day's goods ready until 10:00. What kind of French bakery isn't open by at least 8:00, and has no fresh stuff ready to sell by the time they do open? This place needs to die so a real bakery can serve the good people of Laguna.</Review>< Rating>

< Review>
They screwed up our reservations and the service was extremely slow in fact they forgot one of our orders and took an extra 10 to 15 minutes to bring it to us so we were all done eating when the last person got their order. Never checked to see if we wanted refills. Very disappointing for supposedly a high-end restaurant.< /Review>

<text>We had a reservation for 630 and the host told us that the reservations did not matter because they had too many walk ins.. So we waited over and hour to sit down.. Then we waited over an hour at our table and still no server came to us once.. Every table was complaining that their food was cold, dry and chewy and other tables complained that they had not received there food in over 2 hours, so we took the hint and left. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.<//text><time>1455423011664<//time></record></dataset><record>

I loved this place!  For the price, it's sooooo much better than many of the restaurants around here.  And the food was amazing!  I had the Sea Bass and Bread Pudding.  Two of my favorites and they both were incredible!  And my server, Brittany, was very kind, extremely knowledgable about the food, and very timely as she checked on me.  (I'll request her again when I eat here.)

And who can beat the view????  I watched the sunset over the ocean.  Oh my goodness!  What an amazing evening.  I'll come here again... hope you'll give it a chance too...< /Review>

<user_name>Didimo Raffo< /user_name><review>It was great to have the lunch on the patio, we had a really nice time in this restaurant. I had a great ahi ahi niçoise salad, my wife had the croque monsieur (lots of meat inside, ham or turkey, I don't remember), and my in-laws took the beef filet mignon and fish and chips. All plates were tasty and well prepared.
The raspberry cheesecake was also really good. Espresso was also really good, reminded me the ones I used to have in France.
Also, I thought that the prices were in acceptable range with several plates for less than $20.
The only thing that I did not like was the Walnut tart. I was expecting a crunchier one but had a 'soft' one.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Not sure where to start. It seemed like one thing after another went wrong. Food was very disappointing, service was awful. Our waiter was also our bartender, and made the worst margarita I’ve ever had, I think he forgot the sweet and sour or lime, just tasted like ice blended with tequila. Then he made a snide comment when I sent it back. My kids all ordered crepes off of the adult menu, which were ok, not great, but they were supposed to come with a scoop of ice cream, which they didn’t. When I mentioned it to the waiter he said they ran out, and offered a macaroon instead, but first  tried to sneak it by us without our noticing.

Apparently our orders were on separate tickets from my kids’, because after delivering the kids food We could hear the waiter yelling at the chef for not making the rest, and showing him the missing ticket. By the time we got our food, my kids were almost done eating.

My seafood quiche was decent, but not great. My wife had filet mignon crepe, which was good but way too much sauce and the filet was over cooked.

After all this the waiter adds automatic gratuity, and points out that he did us a favor by only doing 18% because the it’s normally 20%. So I look over the handwritten bill, and notice they overcharged each of the crepe dishes by $2 each. He fixed the bill, and gave us a card for $10 off our next visit.....  hahaha. Like that would ever happen.

Oh yeah, and there’s no air conditioning. The day we visited was 100degrees and it was uncomfortably warm inside the entire meal.

If I’m going to spend $191 on lunch, I expect good food, great service, and a comfortable atmosphere. This place had none of the above. Don’t waste your money<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dce5b549b136b5:0xf8e0c73b80b29a02< /Gmap_id>< pics>

<review>We usually have a good experience but this time was awful. The service was less than standard and you shouldn't have to ask three times for drinks and bread. Don't keep apologizing if you don't mean it. Not sure if we will go back.</review>< time>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>The food at C'est La Vie was very special.. 5 star. I ordered simple, a Tuna Salad sandwich on rye and was I ever surprised. The sandwich was delicious, the bread was fantastic (light and great texture), then they served a pasta salad (which came with it). Best pasta salad I have ever had.

I met and congratulated the cook (Daniel), he happened to come out of the kitchen for a short time. Additionally, the waitstaff was great and the atmosphere is pleasant.

They also have a great patio overlooking Main Beach Park and the ocean. I love this place.

Note: I would give C'est La Vie a 5 star review  except the manager was very rude (before this writing I asked several people about the restaurant and the young manager (35 ish); every single one said he is rude), This manager certainly could work on his friendliness and be more professional with his customers. On the otherhand, the owner is an older man, he and his sister were very nice. Should be 5 Stars for sure!

Food is average. It wasn't crowded, so when the staff keeps talking about personal issues while working it ruins the atmosphere.</review>

One star for this restaurant is way to much. Was there for mother's day and the experience was painful. They couldnt even get the quich right. When I call the manager to give my point of view she came up with so many excuses and no apology.
Do not go there!</Review>

< Review>
We had a reservation for 630 and the host told us that the reservations did not matter because they had too many walk ins.. So we waited over and hour to sit down.. Then we waited over an hour at our table and still no server came to us once.. Every table was complaining that their food was cold, dry and chewy and other tables complained that they had not received there food in over 2 hours, so we took the hint and left. This is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a review and I am not that picky. This truly was the worst experience and I would honestly stay away from this restaurant.</Review>

We always enjoy their French Onion Soup and they have some good sandwhiches.  Good views if you want to sit by PCH and people watch or sit ocean side to hear the waves.  At our last visit, the service was not the best, we were constantly looking for our Server to get more coffee, condiments, out bill.  We will give them one more chance before we go somewhere else.  Lots of options on PCH in the area.<//Review>

< review>
Worst restaurant in town. Restaurant was empty and after 30 minutes we decided to leave since they didn’t pass by to ask for our order. Neither water was served. We complained to the restaurant manager and they didn’t care.</review>

We were not sure what to expect after reading the reviews.  We were very pleasantly surprised.  The manager was very attentive and made sure the server was told about us as soon as we sat down.  He came by several times during the meal to make sure everything was to our liking.

We sat on the covered part of the outside patio.  The forecast had been for rain, but the sun came out.  It was lovely and very comfortable.

Our server was very attentive to us as well as were all the other servers as they walked by---taking empty dishes and filling our water glasses, etc..

The food was delicious!  We had Jumbo Mushrooms with crab for an appetizer.  I had Sea Bass and he had Seafood Fettuccine for the main course.  My friend is from NYC and we have not found any restaurant in OC that he considers as having very good food.  This is the first restaurant that we have found  that he said has very good food!!!

The food is pricey as it is in most French restaurants. Because we were using a Travelzoo voucher, we were very pleased with our experience in every way!</review>< Pics>

<text>Some people meet God standing atop the Grand Canyon; some on the battlefield. I can say that divine intervention appeared before me when glorious beef bourguignon from the Friday french night menu, prepared in an entirely new way (to me), at my command, paired with a deliciously-bodied EnRoute Far Niente.

Prime steak and chops night. Fearsome words only rivaled by "ecstasy" and "heaven" - these are the descriptive modifiers that transformed my evening from the mundane to.... a trip to C'est la Vie.

From perfected dishes presented in front and a wise sommelier filling my glass from behind, I was regaled with tales of truth, and, (I hope) fantastical myth describing the origins of my meal.

Excellence was demonstrated in my presence and I couldn't be more satiated, body and soul.<//text>< pics>

<text>Great location, beautiful ocean views right on the Main Beach in Laguna. Breakfast was excellent, pancakes, eggs benedict all cooked to perfection. Potatoes were golden and crispy. Wonderfully fresh French bread on the side! Even the huevos rancheros were good for a French restaurant, served on a quesadilla base. Service a tad slow but friendly. Now to try some delicious macaroons and Cronuts from the bakery on the way out!</text>< Pics>

Come for the seating next to beach, but don't come for the food. Took my wife here for her birthday and we were expecting French cuisine. The menu is French enough having many of the traditional items. I ordered a Ahi Tartarte for appetizer and it was underwhelming both in looks and taste, not to mention the brown, spotted avocados.

For our entree, wife had the Canard A L'Orange and I had the Entrecote with the ubiquitous peppercorn creme sauce. The duck was soggy and overcooked, tasted like day(s) old food. My ribeye was a fat, sloppy cut, a bit undercooked, but the sauce was a sweet, tangy mess with no peppercorns anywhere. It felt like the chef cooks whatever/however he wanted and haven't read the menu. We were so disappointed with the food we didn't even finish it and decided to pay and leave.

The service was decent enough, but will not be coming back nor recommend any friends to come.</Text>

<Review>My wife and I ate dinner at C'est La Vie on Monday February 8, 2010.  The meal was excellent, reasonably priced and complimented by courteous staff and our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.

We had walked down from our hotel (which had recommended the restaurant), we had the half price bottle of wine with our meal as we understand in California it is OK to Drink and Walk and there was no pressure on us to drink up and leave!

We took dessert back to the hotel with us from their bakery as we were agreeably stuffed!

I had read the mixed reviews before we went and as the negative ones were largely emotional rants and not objectively qualified, both my wife and I are pleased that we ignored them.

It appears the previous reviewer Devo's guest/date/spouse should be pleased if not relieved that they didn't give him a second beer as Valentine's Day is the 14th not the 13th!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

They should invent a word to call their cookies, because the cookies they made just blew my mind away when I thought cookies cannot get any better.

(Translated by Google) It is a beautiful place with an excellent view of the sea, where you can have a delicious hot drink with one of its various cakes, pastries and desserts. It is truly a very good option, and its staff is very friendly.

(Translated by Google) That's a real French corner in Laguna Beach. The food was very delicious, served with a big smile and more. The decoration of the place is authentic, which gives the place a special cachet in full tourist place. Prices are very affordable for the city of Laguna Beach. I recommend it deliciously!

(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant of food and sweet French style. The food is good however I did not have a good experience of their customer service. They are slow to leave the table ready, in ordering you and in general I could be more professional in the service since it is of French style they could honor the culture Culinary of that country. Anyway there are beautiful sea views from the terrace where you can eat outdoors in front of the beach. Good luck.

Es un restaurante de comida y dulceria estilo francés. La comida es buena sin embargo  no tuve una buena experiencia de su servicio al cliente.Demoran para dejar lista la mesa,en hacerte el pedido y en general podría ser más profesional en el servicio ya q es de estilo francés  podrían hacerle honor a la cultura culinaria de ese pais.De todas maneras hay bellísimas vistas al mar desde la terraza donde se puede comer al aire libre frente a la playa. Buena suerte.<//Text>
