The staff member was the best person i have ever dealt with in my life! She was very good with explaining to me everything step by step and she made sure i was understanding everything as well as i could have known everything from her. She was very knowledgeable with the info she explain to me and very nice and kind and she knew her stuff with everything. I am appreciate it about how she had great people skills and knowledge at all the info about everything and thanks to her i was comfortable and not worried about my belongings and leaving there with more info i needed to understand how everything with the storage unit and now knowing my items are totally safe and she made me at ease....</text>

Excellent service and response, great price. The only reason it didn't get a 5 was because of the old fashioned freight elevator, where you have to deal with two heavy metal gates to haul up and down...can be tricky if you have weaker arm strength.</Review>

< Review>
Operating hours are not accessible for people who work. Covid hours should be adjusted so that people who are working and renting units don't have to take time off work to access lockers. Closing at 4pm is not realistic for anyone who works full time.

Every other storage unit facility offers access hours until 10 pm. Terrible business model.< /Review>

<review>Customer service excellent, I would love it if there was a limit to the amount of personal items you bring according to your storage unit. If you bring more then can fit in your storage, what is the point  only because some items are dirty and will bring bugs, cucarachas, and that is what you can see. Clean and clear .</review>< Time>

I came down less then ten minutes later at 10:15am and the office is closed. There's a sign saying they'd be back at 10:34. Not only did they not say they would be leaving they didn't come back till 10:53.

Why take someone's I.d and then disappear. I had to be at work at 10:30, I had to wait more than 30 minutes to get my I.d back.

How extremely disrespectful of my time, when I said they should've told me they were leaving when they took my stuff the guy said "welp sorry, we were having a meeting” I hope it focused on customer service.

Cool, hope I don't get fired. Thanks.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Reasonably clean for A storage facility. Seems safe.   Easy access wuth two huge freight elevators.  I have ALWAYS gotten a parking spot here, no problem.  The best part of the Ballpark storage experience though, by far is the friendly, accommodating staff.   These guys go out if their way to help in any way they can.   I recommend this place to anyone!
4/5 stars because a huge super cool shelving unit I had JUST bought, never showed itself after my initial move in.   Poof!< /Review><gmapID>0x80d953597f1979f1:0x19758e8206adc96<//gmapID>< pics>

I highly recommend Ballpark Storage, and I give an A+++ to it's friendly staff, and one customer service rep in particular, Joey, who's been extremely helpful & accommodating from day 1. When I ran into an unexpected last minute hiccup, and needed an extra hand, Joey went above and beyond to help me. Not only did he quickly find an additional storage space, but he even helped me unload some items to speed up the process.</text>

This place is in a great location and for reasonable prices too! I needed the unit for an emergency (same day and within the hour), and I had my unit within 30 minutes thanks to Adam Martin. The security in the building is exactly what I wanted so I don't worry about my belongings. After some time of having the storage I lost my key. I was helped by Sam Arias who was super friendly, and who made this process a fast fix. This place definitely deserves all five stars!< /Text>

Living in Cambodia, almost half way around the world from San Diego, it has been great to know that Adam and Tony are taking great care of my unit. Adam often would find me a small unit I could use for temporary overflow usage as I sorted through the original shipment of 44 years of collections overseas whenever I would make a return visit to the States to work on downsizing.

Both of the boys were so cheerful and pleasant. They would go out of their way to be sure I had everything I needed.

The Ballpark Self Storage facility is in a great location. It really doesn't need climate control as it is there in the heart of San Diego which almost always has ideal weather!< /text>

I just moved to San Diego and was looking for a safe, clean, affordable storage unit as an extension to my apartment.  I was delighted to find Ballpark Storage, which is run by the nicest people.  I feel very comfortable and safe going in and out of the facility, and I appreciate the staff's help and friendliness.  The facility is convenient, easy to get in and out of, and well maintained and monitored.  Thanks to Liz and Anna for welcoming me and making me feel at home in their building and community.<//review>

I've rented a storage space from here twice, and everyone here has always been courteous and helpful. The downtown location is great and convenient for me.  I needed a small storage unit, and found them to have the best price! Other storage facilities I checked wanted to charge me $20 - $30 more for the small space. Anytime I've gone in to their office, everything's been done quickly and efficiently....no waiting around. Thanks!</Review>

Don't rent from ballpark storage or any other storage place in downtown they are in the practice of ripping people off. If you move out during the grace period they say they will reimburse the difference, doesn't happen a discount to rent again is all you will get. And no they are not clean, and I should change them for punitave damages, I have several items in my unit chewed up by rats</Review>

<Text>Great customer-service experience today with my U-Haul rental.  I received a pleasant and helpful call from Adam letting me know that everything was set up and ready to go (happily surprised by that); he also explained particular options that ended up making my rental much less stressful than it might have been otherwise.  When I arrived at their office, I found that it was clean and organized, and that my sales rep (Adam) was just as courteous and informative in person as he was on the phone; also, there was never any unnecessary attempt to upsale (e.g., insurance).  I would definitely use Ballpark Self Storage again and would highly recommend them to anyone who values quality customer service.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I'm writing this review to share my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the Ballpark Self Storage team. Adam, Sam and their entire staff were so terrific to interact with as I was grinding through my recent Downtown move. For any of you that have relocated from one Downtown condo rise to another, I'm sure you can relate to the challenging HOA bureaucracy that's involved with scheduling, coordinating and completing the transition of your items. I had to rent their U-Haul van three separate times over the course of eight days to complete my move and each time I arrived to pick it up I found them to be the singularly positive part of my day. They were extremely accommodating with the pick-up and drop off each time and actually waived some normally charged add-ons like the dolly rental or gas usage each time I came in. On top of that, the second time I came in I needed some of those packing peanuts and instead of charging me whatever each for the smaller bags they sell the awesome lady helping me said, "I just put two big garbage bags full of them in our dumpster if you'd like to have them." They were like brand new and saved me about $40! I've never even heard of someone doing anything like that! Now don't get me wrong, these people are running a business and no one should expect a ton of freebies from a place that needs to turn a profit, but they certainly rewarded my customer loyalty and repeat business. I can honestly give my highest possible praise and recommendation for the Ballpark Self Storage team and wouldn't think of using another company for a future move or storage unit rental. I wish I could give them 10 Stars, they'd deserve them all! Thanks so very much for everything Ballpark Team, and I wish you all a wonderful Holiday Season!< /review>

We continually shuffled this equipment in and out needing a point of contact for shippers and the Ballpark Storage team was extremely accomodating.

<Review>I have been renting a storage unit at Ballpark Self Storage for almost 5 years. Besides its desirable locations, right at the heart of downtown San Diego, the treatment I have been receiving from Adam's team is superb customer service (friendly, respectful and helpful). I think they have clearly been implementing and understood the critical element of customer service of  the good ol'days notion “customer is king” in their marketing strategy, which adds value to their service in order so as to create loyal and satisfied customers, and they have been able to  retain their clients  for so long. However, as compared to their location and other competing facilities in the vicinity, their price for different size storage units are fairly decent. Moreover, if you would like to pay your rent in advance, let's say for six months or one year, they will offer you a huge discount as far as off one full month from your rent. Plus if you make a referral to your friends, they are more than willing to award you a bonus. Above all, honestly speaking, if someone is looking for a storage unit situated in a central place, with a fairly low cost, this is an ideal and preferred place to look for, and I would definitely recommend unhesitatingly this facility.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

A hag landlady of mine tossed me out on the streets for reporting bugs and mice in my apartment, and these people allowed me to store my things during the time frame in receiving a new apartment. Thanks to BPS I can still post my most valuable possessions on earth. The crayon-drawn birthday and father's day cards from my children when they were little people mean more to me than all of the other property I also stored there. In two short months I was back in a better apartment with a landlord who takes care of business and doesn't try to kick people out who report incidents. Thank you Ballpark Storage for providing a place for cold water, bathrooms, and storage for those of us who need it most.

All of their staff is very pro and helpful, especially Adam!  They worked with me on pick up/drop off times for the truck to suit my needs.  The ability to walk downtown to pick up the Uhaul truck is a huge plus for me.  They have a pick-up truck, cargo van and 10' Uhaul suitable for smaller (studio/1 or 2BR) condo/apt moves.  Additionally, they have competitive prices on moving boxes and packing supplies.  I would recommend Ballpark Storage to anyone moving in or out of downtown and will certainly use them in the future.

Thanks again!< /review>

Ballpark Storage by far has to the best UHAUL Place I have encountered. I had a challenging move from one apartment to another recently and found this place online. Sure in GasLamp you are bound to pass this place on the way to work or to Petco; but never really thought about going in.

The establishment is clean inside and out. The staff is amazing. Not only are they personable and nice, they are professional. ADAM & TONY were resourceful, efficient and eager to get the best solution for your moving needs. Thank you for the great service!<//text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Ballpark Storage  the entire place could have used a new coat of paint 25 years ago. The elevators are newer than original hand-crank types but just barely by a few days; either one or both at the same time rarely work. There is one bathroom for over a 1,000 units, usually out of order unless the HOMELESS  want to do their drugs or prostitution. Floors are wood, chipped and uneven. The staff are invited, allowed and appreciated when they are crude, curt, cavalier, belligerent with the customers. One of the Assistant managers are allowed to bring their wife and young children in so she can teach them how to use the company computer; if this employee is working the bathroom is PLACED OUT OF ORDER AS HE NEVER CLEANS IT. HE TAKES UP TO AN HOUR AND HALF LUNCH BREAK AND FERQUENTLY SHOWS UP TO OPEN 45 MINUTES LATE!!! Ballpark's policy is to nickel and dime you to death. There will eternally be a new charge or increase. People sleep in the hallways and storage units during the day. THERE ARE A LOT OF HOMELESS AT THIS CAMP.<//text>< Pictures>

A storage company with a fair rate unfortunatly thier billing department is horrendous and completely unwilling to work with thier customers who are not in state I had an authorized represenative remove the last of the items in my storage container and when he tried to end contract the company refused to allow him even though I was not in state when I personally talked to the company they told me they could not end my contract since the lock was still on the container even though I know for a fact it is not.< /Review>

<review>This is my go to place for printing and scanning in my local neighborhood. There’s a small lady with glasses that works there in the printing section and she’s so helpful, she’s a delight, very friendly and knowledgeable about anything print related. As Taft as the rest of the store goes it is a rather small location and has everything you need in an office and if they don’t have it there (whatever you’re looking for) there is a probability that it can be ordered and delivered to you. Huge parking lot. The only thing is for some reason the restrooms are always out of order.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>1< /rating><review>If I could rate this negative Stars I would. Never in my life have I ever been made to feel so badly then I have while shopping except for here at the Staples. From the moment I stepped into the Staples the security guard asked me to put my backpack behind his desk in the front before you even enter the store and the entry area that's typical around that area so I didn't feel anything too much about that however the moment that I walked down the aisle after entering the store mind you I'm wearing bright yellow shorts tiny shorts that are small okay hardly fit anything you can see everything in my pockets and a small Hawaiian button-up shirt as well and nothing else like I had no other bags or anything just too small articles of clothing that was wearing on that warm day and they still felt the need that same security guard left my things mind you unattended in the front where there's just the entryway and then there's entry to the store after that entryway but he's left my stuff unsecured to stalk me in the in the aisle to see where I was going and paid attention to me the entire time like literally didn't even make it discreet the way that he followed me and then when he had to go to the front for something immediately another employee was sent with the task of following me and then the manager started to follow me when there was no one else to follow me I couldn't help but to notice that I was the only one of tan skin of his darkest mind in the store and I've noticed everyone else that walks in the store we're greeted and typically just not really even acknowledged anymore unless they ask the question but I was constantly stared at with this worst looks from the staff as if they thought I was stealing and I've not stolen a thing of my entire life my entire my entire life I live a life with very strong morals and good integrity and values and I don't lie cheat or steal literally I'm a vegetarian for crying out loud. And then when I brought it up to the manager at the end after I bought spent $186 there on just a backpack and a couple of stencils and a pen I would have spent more but I just felt so sick to my stomach and uncomfortable there I didn't even want to buy the things I bought there because of how they treated me but I did it for for principal this place is the worst the manager gave me some BS excuse instead of just owning up to it and it admitting it profiled me and that was it like no care no concern this is the worst place to go if you're tanned skin.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c77b743ed8a9:0x8acd600c7dd27893< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>This Staples is the most trash place on Earth. No one is helpful. The machines are always broken and if you thought you'll be out of here in a reasonable amount of time you're sorely mistaken.<//Review>< Pics>

The most inept people I have ever met. I have come several times and every experience was worse than the previous one... it looks like they simply don’t want to do their job and are making an extra effort to put excuses to make you go. Lesson learned: never coming back.< /Text>

I’m glad we bought them in person there as the associates, cashier and store manager were super helpful and friendly. They even assisted with loading the chairs. We had them assembled there for a small fee and picked them up the next day.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Worst of the worst, I went to laminate something and there was this lady pushing a senior to use the self serve copy It took forever and the senior was clearly frustrated, I would be less frustrated for the senior to have her doing the copy and probably take less time, then she told me that I have to wait 1 hour for limitation, I talk to manager about the situation with the senior and he did not care at all, he said that was the way systems work and they don't care to help, don't go there specially if you are old and you have hard time using technology.<//Text>< pics>

< review>
With so much negativity coursing through the world I very very rarely chime in with a negative review (besides Fate takes care of things much better than I ever could), but the callous disregard was too much to let slide. Copy Center clerk could barely be bothered to even point me toward a copy machine. Then, after I mistakenly placed my originals upside down and asked for a re-run, neither he nor his colleague would do more than shrug and offer "Staples Does't Refund for User Error."

Apparently "Staples Doesn't Help PREVENT User Error" either. Otherwise a clerk (or a sign) would've said Place Face Up. Surely I'm not the first customer to not know which was the right end up.

Worse is the fact that Staples Refuses to show even small consideration to the customer who makes a mistake. Make that ex-customer. Because while I may have lost a measly $6.13, Staples has lost my business forever.< /review>

<Review>Nowadays, I rarely experience being treated and accomodated professionally by store employees with sincerity and courtesy.  I really want to praise and give thanks to Marlon from Ormoc and Benjie from Iligan both working at Staples in West 6th Street Los Angles, CA, yesterday for their effort on helping me out find not just what I want but what I really need.  When I addressed my concern they made efforts and provided an alternative solution by not just saying no to me and say we don’t have what you are looking for or we ran out, then leave the customer unsatisfied and helpless.  Good job guys!

I came in this morning to buy office supplies for my daughters school donation. I left a pack of correction tape because it was going over my budget, then the nice gentlemen Jerry at the register asked what was it for and he kindly donated it for the school.
I greatly appreciate his gesture.

Thank you STAPLES for having such nice employees. May God continue blessing your business.

I will definitely will continue to buy from Staples< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Worst experience ever. Was trying to return some items bought online. They said since I clicked return on my phone, I’ll have to print the label and ship it. Even though I brought the item here and even I’m right in the store! That’s ridiculous. Can’t you guys be flexible? Why doing things that’s slow and none sense. Then I went to the self print area, after I sent the file and pre authorized my card, the printer went down. And the lady said I’ll have to redo it again on another printer. Why returning an item is so hard in this store location?  Also, the cashier is working in a really slow pace. And there’s only one cashier but four customers. A lady who’s at the online order counter just stay there instead of come over to open another counter to help check out.< /Review>

We were on vacation in LA and received an emailed contract we needed to sign and send back. The General Manager, Dennis, was extremely helpful walking us through the process of getting this done. He was very kind and his customer service was exceptional. The only reason for 4 stars was that the entrance was difficult to find as Staples owns the whole building and leases to other businesses as well. All in all we were very pleased with the service at  the 6th Streer location! Thank you, Dennis!< /Text>

I've only been in here twice, but both times different associates were very friendly, helpful, and patient. My most recent experience was me trying to get a chair for our newly set up trailer office for our construction company. Rick , which I believe is the manager went above and beyond to help me get not only the chair i needed, but also assembled and in a timely manner. There were special circumstances he helped with to make sure I was able to get everything in time. Thank you Rick for your great customer service and patience, and thank you to your friendly associates.</Text>

Hit or miss for the crowds, which is a sure that they're a victim of their own success. Customer service is absolutely excellent. It's a busy place and the printing, computer, copier equipment doesn't work consistently. EVERYBODY in customer service there is extremely friendly, and if something isn't right, they do their best to make it up to me. I jacked it up from 4 to 5 stars to help the average, because *I* think it's 8 out of 10 and that's what I want you to see first. Owning my truth over here.<//Text>

The fat white girl in the copy department is extremely rude. Sat on her phone instead of interacting with customers with questions. Asked her to help load funds on my card after she said she would help her register was conveniently closed.</review>

on June 6, I went to store 1499 to print my documents, only five papers, charge 12.50 dollars. It was first time I went to Staple and I had no idea, plus there were no staffs said use the computer per min is 0.30 dollar and sign are hide behind the computer. I asked the manager there was any discount but the manager refuse my request. Then I told the live chat, however they said only final decision by manager. Just run and hide.< /review>

<Text>The Copy Center is always busy and chaotic. They never have enough staff to work that area. It's always 1 or 2 saps that are running around trying to help a crowd of people there. I literally left having paid for scanning something onto my USB only to come home and realize it was never scanned. But it's hard to ask for help or receive it because they are so busy.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2c77b743ed8a9:0x8acd600c7dd27893<//gmapID><user_id>105063372009362370319</user_id><date>1548987308854</date><Pics>None< /Pics><name>Sarah Lee</name><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<rate>2</rate><Text>First of all, the entrance to Staples is impossible to find from either 6th or New Hampshire. The entrance to the building on 6th only includes an utterly useless sign that says that it’s not an entrance to Staples, without actually telling us where to go. I had to run around the block before finally finding the entrance next to Walgreens.

As for the actual printing, it isn’t cheap, at $0.50 a page. On top of that, the computers also charge for every minute of use. To add insult to injury, they also tried to charge me for color printing ($1.00 a page) even after I had already selected black and white. I asked the staff for help, and they totally forgot about me after they were done with the previous customer. Of course, the computer continued to charge me for using them. I had to flag that same employee again before she finally resolved the issue for me.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>WORST STORE ON THE PLANET!   Not just the worst Staples in existence, not just the worst office supply store on the planet, but the worst retail outlet of any kind on the planet... Staff is unresponsive, self-serve copy machines are all broken down, no one cares, long lines due to incompetence... they couldn’t care less how long you wait or how broken-down their facilities are!!!

It even takes 4 escalations and calls to the store number (from inside the store) to get an employee in that store to unlock the restroom!   Absolutely disgraceful!

THAT WAS EXTREMELY UNBELIEVABLY ARDUOUSLY INCOMPARABLY HARD!!!!!!  If ‘that was easy,’ I'd hate to see difficult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Avoid this place like the plague!   This store should be shuttered immediately!!!  Has NO BUSINESS being IN BUSINESS!!!!   Unless you want to completely waste your time.

We should be able to rate 0 -- this store truly deserves it!!!</Text>< Pictures>

They had a good selection. I came here to print and scan a document. The staff that were in that department seemed too preoccupied behind the counter to tend to my needs. But, it might have been just a busy time for them. I'd still come here to this location.<//text>

Even though this store location is huge and has just about every bit off office and school's supplies one could hope for; the customer service here completely sucks. Even though there are a decent amount of employees that work here, there never seems to be enough to help those who need it in the printing department. Korea town is one of the busiest neighborhoods in the Los Angeles, one would think that this location would be prepared for that kind of intense traffic that comes through here.<//review>

Girls at the print counter did not know how to service customers properly. I spent 1 hour to have my 1 page document printed. During this time I saw many other customers getting upset or leaving due to the lack of performance. The attitute was also an issue. Staples better get their staff trained or get decent workers or it will not survive.< /text>

The Walgreen parking lot entrance is an option too, but it is confusing if you don't know what you're doing since it's not obvious you can park there for Staples too.

The store itself is pretty good; we grab office supplies here every now and then. Staff is friendly.< /review>< Pics>

I've never had any problems picking up office supplies here.

If you work in an office, you need pens. You need paper. You need notebooks.

Their computer selection is really really small< /review>

<text>The print center here is a mess! Not only did I spend 7-8 minutes on hold each time I called but I got nothing done! After trying to figure out if my document that I sent over was there or not, which took an hour, I was told their three computers are not working correctly in the print center. So I asked the supervisor..."How do you plan on dealing with this? Do you need to call someone to get these computers fixed?" And he replied that he needed to take a look at it later. I'm sorry but this is all wrong! However you need to get your computers fixed, you need to get on that asap. Deliver customer service instead of excuses because I was completely inconvenienced today. When all I needed was ONE SHEET OF PAPER PRINTED. Ridiculous.<//text>< Pictures>

I was looking for headphones for my phone, and I know that my phone has a standard 3.5mm jack. When I asked the staff to help me, he wanted to see my phone to be sure, and then he claimed that this is not a standard jack, that it is smaller than 3.5mm and that I had to buy something special. Just be sure to know what you are looking for before going to the store.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

this store is my store to go..let me tell you of an experience i had that started a few days. i went to the store as usual with a request to print something and from my i think you call it a hard drive - its a big thing - not like those stick looking gadgets.  i left it there because getting there at 8 am and - lily the asso who helped me  out  was not as accommodating like how i'm use to the other associates.  I was told to do these, go there and was amazed at how much it cost me for her to edit my stuff,  she could just have gone to the open computer that i was using and teach me from there - it was just a matter of fonts that i needed to do for a sign.
.
i ended up  leaving my hard drive - passport as how i call it.  I was a little overwhelmed at that point but still managed to figure things out after paying  more than  $20  since I had to figure it our myself.

Well the reason I'm writing this comment - i came back to the store and the moment she saw me she knew who  I was since she addressed me by name and when i asked for what i left behind - ohh - i left it on the counter..that's it ...that's the cold answer i got  from her and the  other associate called for help to see maybe it was kept in the safe.  all the time -  lily never bothered with looking for it - maybe the occastional  - let me try -   since the other asso was trying her best - she just kept on the computer which was really very rude and unprofessional.  I later walked to ask the help of team supervisor then who actually when he started to look for it on the desk, the drawer - he found it...still that cold help reception from lily.
Lily needs to undergo more customer training and sensitivity.  Staples is service oriented store and associates  like lily should have not made me feel - like i was bothering her and not her concern if its found or not - when she said "Ohh i left it on the counter...this is really bad customer service.
My thanks to the supervisor and the other asso who went out of her way to help.< /Text>

The roaming security guy kinda makes one feel unwelcome, like it’s not normal to be browsing the store. So instead of staying longer, I decided to pay for my envelopes and left.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>Utter garbage manager with a staff that is equally terrible. Don't try to call for anything, they pick up and hang up the phone. Manager is rude to both customers and staff. Maybe the people who work there are good people, but it's clear from how the manager treats them they have zero incentive to do so. Lost my business forever.< /review>< Pictures>

Worst experience ever! I'm an Office Depot shopper but had to go to staples because there is none near where I live now. Waited in the line for 17 minutes and no cashier acknowledged anybody in the line. 3 employees were helping ONE client at the copy and print center. NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN! It's not even busy.< /text>

< Review>
Horrible customer service. In store service is horrendous, few staff while the ones that are there are either on their phone or can't help you because they're " just a cashier, OK " Ugh.  Nobody knows anything through the phone. They make you wait for 15 m just to ask a follow up question and just to put you on hold again. The so called manager is just a wanna be in dress pants. He's so uptight, he can't see-  how inefficient he and his staff are. But they are just a reflection of their management and poor leadership skills.<//Review>

Worst experiance at any store ever!  Totally under-staffed, computers did not work, no reception in the store for my Verizon iPhone X.  The employees were overwealmed, not knowledgeable, and inept.  Sad considering LA is supposed to be Staples city.  Will never shop at a staples again because of this.</Text>

Worst staff ever! The printing center is terrible, I spent over 30 mins there and didn't get anything done, they don't care about the customers at all, after I wasted 30 mins in the broken sell printing machines, the girl in charge of the printing told me it would take 2hrs!!! to print 1 sheet of paper, avoid this place, save yourself some trouble.<//Text>

Most of their supplies are overpriced, you can get most basic materials from the dollar store probably, there are a lot of other useful things here too though.</text>

The personnel at this store are incompetent and untrustworthy. I asked a young woman on the phone to hold a product that was in short supply, she said she would, and after driving an hour out of my way to get to the store the manager told me that they were sold out and that it was against their policy to hold items of that type.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The entrance to the store is on the opposite side of the street (behind the building), which is hard to understand. I wanted to use a copy machine, but there was a long line for the three copies. I waited for more than 20 minutes. All the female staff at the counter next to the self-copy are terrible. It is said that it is displayed on the copy machine screen even if you ask about the operation method, and there is no correspondence. After all, I left the store without knowing how to use it.

(Original)
店の入り口が通りの反対側にあり（ビルの裏側）分かりづらい。コピー機を利用したかったが3台のコピーには長蛇の列。20分以上待った。セルフコピー横の窓口にいる女性店員の対応が皆ひどい。操作方法を聞いてもコピー機画面に表示されるとのみ言われ対応無し。結局使い方が分からず店を出た。< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>First time coming here and absolutely LOVED it! My kids picked out there own bear, had it stuffed, put a heart inside and said a little quote with the employee and then she sewed it closed. There is a wall of clothes and accessories and even scents to customize the bear with. They also get to name their bear at the end and get a certificate and house for the bear.< /Text>< Pictures>

My 2yr old was turned away for Build-A-Bear event, which was hard after waiting several hours. Staff didn't know what to do. Mall security was as confused too. Both saying there is a line, then there is no line. Being told you could create a line. When everything was finally figured, we went from being in front of the line to the end. By the time we go to the front, sorry we are closing at 8pm and if we made it by then, we were good but didn't happen. Whole day wasted.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I loved this place because there are many stuffed animals and you can also do them

Best sandwich place in the area! A must visit when you're in cypress. The owners are the friendliest and nicest people ever and provide outstanding customer service that I've ever experienced! They offer complementary house iced green tea for dine in customers, it's refreshing. Try their croissant sandwiches, the croissant tastes freshly made. 19a is the Chinese pork sandwich and add fried egg with everything, it's delicious. Overall great experience every time and great quality food!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I came here today for lunch and was very impressed and extremely satisfied!  The owner who served me right away suggested which sandwiches I should consider trying.  Since it was getting warm outside he gave me a cold tea, on the house as well as a little dessert. Not only that, he walked my food out to my car so I could eat.  The sandwich was delicious and it was perhaps the best Vietnamese coffee I have ever had (and I've been to Vietnam).  I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!!!< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Nice little strip mall find. Friendly service, tasty sandwich, cramped little shop, just the way I like it.

I got the house special and an iced coffee. The sandwich had just the right blend of tangy veg and savory meat.

Sandwiches run about 6.50, more than worth it.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><response>None<//response><Text>Some restaurants you just want them to succeed, this is one of them.  The guy had just such a happy friendly demeanor and the food was great.  We came a little early and we were the only people, but shortly after many people started showing up.  Sandwiches were delicious, well balanced, not too heavy (I like heavy sandwiches as well).  The noodles were pretty good, but the main is the sandwich.  I prefer the french roll over the croissant, but both were good. He randomly hooked us up with some free snacks.  Will definitely go again and recommend to my friends.  I wish him and his family success and happiness.  This restaurant, the food, and the guy just made my day and made me smile.</Text></record>

<Text>Definitely the Greatest Vietnamese sandwich I have had thus far.

This is a small mom and pop shop selling some sundries and sandwiches.

With Vietnamese sandwich, the owner offered me a free complimentary Vietnamese tea and cookie.

The sandwich was very simple, yet refreshing. Served on a semi-baguette Vietnamese style, with some pork meats, and pickles sauce. The sweetness contrast nicely with the banh-mi style garnishes such as thinly sliced raw jalapeños.

For less than nine dollars with all the complimentary throw-ins, would definitely come back here again.< /Text><time>1609177051231< /time>< GmapID>

<Text>This family owned shop churns out delicious sandwiches but what sets them apart is the genuine hospitality. It's like they're welcoming you as guests into their home. It's from a place of love and the taste of their food shows it. Our takeout order with a complimentary jasmine tea. I mean. Seriously, love.

I got the #1 and #6 -- blown away by the quality of ingredients and taste. Lovely Cypress gem.

Please support local.

Sandwich House is a must try! They are my favorite banh mi sandwiches and really, one of my favorite restaurants in OC! Not only is their food delicious, but it is run by some of the kindest people. You are met with so much kindness and hospitality - the best customer service ever! They even give all of their customers complentary iced tea with each order.

My favorite meal is their #1 Sandwich House Special with an avocado smoothie! Highly recommend, but really everything that I've tried on the menu is delicious. I also love the #21 BBQ chicken on a croissant with an added fried egg added on top! Also their homemade buttered toast/biscuts are amazing! They make look simple, but you have to try a box. Once you start, you won't be able to stop - so good!

I've been going here for years and will continue to because food that is made with love always tastes better and Vu and Ann truly do love their customers!< /text>

Mr. Vu makes an incredible banh mi, but more importantly he is a man with exceptional character and kindness. We were stationed in SoCal for three years, and the every time we went in, he welcomed me, my family, and my friends (military) with such warmth and gratitude, we felt like he was family. Always one to place others first, he would constantly send us home with extra pastries and small desserts. The Sandwich House is a place you simply must try for both the quality of the food and the quality of the owner. You will love it, and be loved in return!<//review>

The Sandwich House has become my favorite place to eat, the couple that run the establishment consistently make the effort to treat all of their customers like lifelong friends, and make the best banh mi around. Not to mention they use high quality ingredients and its easy to taste the difference.< /Review>

<username>Julie Ghim</username><date>1599629960471<//date><rating>5</rating><Text>Ahn and Vu have always been my favorite place for bahn mi or croissant sandwiches. I’ve been a regular for several years now and they never fail me. I usually go for the #4 or the #19 (without onions). The beef stew is also excellent on a chilly day, available w/baguette or vermicelli noodles!

They remember my face/name, my order, what I’ve been up to lately, etc. Recently due to covid they haven’t been getting as much business from the bulk of their customers at Cypress College across the street. Small businesses are always the most vulnerable in times such as these.

Free sugared toast and jasmine iced tea with every order, and you can call ahead for pick-up to streamline the whole process. Please support this lovely sandwich shop- you won’t regret it! :)<//Text>< pics>

The Sandwich House across from Cypress College has, hands down, the best Vietnamese sandwiches and coffee.  What makes it truly special is the man behind the counter.  He is warm, kind, and loves his patrons.  Now during our isolation, since we place our order either over the phone or at the counter then wait outside, he adds an dose of extra kindness, with free cinnamon crisps or cookies.  For favorite customers it might be free iced tea as well.  The person who makes the sandwiches is generous with the ingredients, always served on the freshest of baguette or croissant.  Thank you, Sandwich House!<//review>

The #1 Sandwich House Special is awesome and all you could want from a Vietnamese sandwich.

The rice vermicelli is on point too. Highly recommend stopping by and checking this place out.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Let me start off by saying I really wanted to like this place and support local mom and pop business, unfortunately, their food had let me down too many times.

The good:
The friendly service from both the husband and wife were great and they are really friendly people that offer free iced tea and provide an excellent experience. Sad to say, that's pretty much it.

The bad:
I've seen other bad reviews about the lack of actual meat in their sandwiches but thought it might have been a one off or just a picky customer, but nope, its really true.  I really have this place a chance and have been here multiple times and every time I get at least one underwhelming sandwich and even a missing sandwich on a large order to go. Lastly, their pricing is higher than vietnamese sandwich shops in Westminister. Soooo ... high pricing and poor quality food is a no go for me. Im probably not coming back here again.

Last words:
There isn't enough free iced tea that can make up  for this.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3lmNSe7KQa5GpCFJKt-pa65oTDrzSy9R2hyNr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4a3gHzrPxBuEchmz9Mty5qI4ytDzw2BHhR55y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNxVtGF4Ll0rd1cbWT8O_QsoWVIJqxo93ql8sH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

<time>1605786989536<//time><rate>5</rate><text>The clear standout of this restaurant is their customer service. Both before and during the pandemic we'd always get complimentary iced tea and small snacks with our orders. One time they even ran out of their normal snacks and gave us a whole bundt cake! That alone keeps me coming back.

I typically order either the dac biet or the thit nuong.  The bread itself has a solid crust but is still soft on the inside. The meat portions are smaller than some other shops but I still think the freebies you get make up for it. Their beef stew is also a solid choice to get.

Give this place a shot if you're in Cypress. The kindness of the owners and the good food will definitely win you over!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>The customer service is great here and the sandwiches are delicious, however with my order I asked for extra bbq pork at a $2 upcharge and I was extremely disappointed to see that there was virtually no meat in the sandwich and what little was there was only on one half. Regardless it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Just check that your order is correct before leaving.<//Review>< pictures>

They are so incredibly kind here! I came in a little last minute with a large-ish sandwich order and Vu didn’t bat an eye. He was very kind, super helpful explaining their options and ranking their choices in popularity. He sat me down with a little snack and some iced tea while I waited for my order. He even packaged it up and took it out to my car for me!! I drove here from Long Beach in rush hour to get here.  The service was excellent.. the sandwiches were soooo delicious, it was worth every minute on the road! I’ll be back.< /review>

This place sandwich is tiny, like half the size of the subway sandwiches.  It's not even that cheap either.  I rather they charge a dollar or two more and double the size of the sandwich.</text>

<Review>A M A Z I N G!!! I’m a college student who goes here for a filling lunch as I work on homework (FREE WIFI).  Not only do you get a free tea as a drink, you get free little snack desserts after each meal :) Such great caring owners that come to be close to their daily customers as they know what I order once they see me.
Ps: Their sandwiches are better than Lee’s< /Review></record>

The OG spot for many locals, students, and hungry people. Sandwich House is a location in which has been running for a long time. To be honest the location is literally a hidden gem because it is located at the back corner of the parking lot. The service, quality, and love that the owners give deserve more than 5 stars and so, you should go have the place a visit asap<//text>

It is SUPER RARE to come across a place where out of the blue the worker unexpectedly offers you a free to go cup of cold ice tea while you are waiting for your food order to be prepared. This cup is not even a small size either! Moreover, I was completely shocked because this was my first time there and I have never met these people before. These people not only know how to make delicious sandwiches but their kindness to their customers is absolutely amazing! Totally blown away!</text>

He truly makes you feel welcomed when you visit his place. The food is tasty and fresh. Might be a little pricey,  but it is well worth it.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

My boyfriend and I went here to grab lunch and it was the best decision! We got two Vietnamese sandwiches and it didn’t take long to come out. It was fresh and so yummy. The owner gave us tea on the house and cookies for dessert. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone (,:< /review>

<Text>First, let it be known that yes, the food is absolutely amazing. But in all honesty, the owners are the nicest, sweetest, most caring people I've ever met, and that's why I keep coming back. Any time you come in you are welcomed and treated like family. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. Please stop in and give it a try.</Text>< pics>

Yum.   For a hole in the wall the food is exceptional. The service was stellar. This little gem is not in my area but it's worth seeing out. You have to really look it's tucked in a back  Corner. I have the number one on the French roll perfect.</Text>

<time>1483892201948< /time><rate>5</rate><Text>Sandwiches are delicious. They also have American options as well. Reasonably priced for what you get. The space itself is very quaint, with lots of fresh fruits on display under the counter and letters of love taped to the wall. Service was outstanding. We ordered 3 sandwiches which was going to take a little time to make, so the person who took our order invited us to sit down and offered us these bread-dessert things and iced green tea (in to go cups) with a refill in a carafe. For only spending $20, they very much went out of their way to make us happy. It was the best treatment I've ever had at a sandwich shop. Most importantly the sandwiches are delicious! Beware the Vietnamese traditional sandwiches are very spicy. Delicious but spicy. Enjoy!< /Text>< pictures>

Top notch customer service! The sandwiches are really tasty, but they skimp on the fillings. Very thin spread of tuna. Also tried to the BBQ pork and the pork was barely there. I wish they would add a bit more for the price. The bread is fantastic though, way better than Lee's.</text>

<review>House Special sandwich is incredibly good. I could eat like three at a time, and they're reasonably priced so it's not a problem. The owner is super sweet and always offers some extra tasty treats on the house, like cookies and fresh iced tea. This place is great!< /review>< pictures>

<review>The best place to go for authentic vietnamese food.  The service was excellent.  The owner was very friendly helpful and made our visit a memorable one.  Once you go there you'll always choose to go to this place only. I plan to go back with my boyfriend next week.
The ambiance inside and out is so very charming.   This place gets an A+.< /review><user_id>109944045590398412980</user_id><rate>5< /rate><Gmap_id>0x80dd2eaf30520823:0xf7f092a836aab76b</Gmap_id></record>

First class service with plenty of hot or cold food options at Sandwich House.  I ordered the beef soup with french bread on an overcast cold day, which hit the spot! The iced unsweetened tea was a nice touch. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating which works wonders for smokers whom have appetite.</text>

Wow. Excellent food, great pricing, and the customer service here is seriously the best I've had at any sandwich shop. The little homemade sweet bread Toasties that come with the sandwiches are delicious! 10/10 would recommend and I'll be back many times!</review>

This is a place hidden behind plain site across the street from Cypress College. It's a quaint, unassuming little place but it provides wonderful serenity and peace about it. The owners are super wonderful & friendly!!! And of course, the food are very yummy and excellent with a homestyle flare to it. I had the chicken banhmi sandwich and it was bomb! They even gave complimentary iced tea & water while I waited for my order, then, gave my son cookies & mini lollipops when we left. This place is very much like Lee's Sandwiches but provides that feeling like you are eating at grandma's house. The prices are comparable, if not cheaper, than other sandwich places. I highly recommend this wonderful Sandwich House! Yummy!!!</Review>

I have been coming to this place since it practically opened and I figured I should finally write a review on it! The owner is so wonderful and energetic and she will make a point to remember you which makes coming here so much more amazing! There is no wrong choice in food because everything is amazing. I personally love the #16 which is a ham and cheese croissant and the beef stew with bread! They give you complementary tea and sweet little slices of bread that have been toasted! I'll probably come here for as long as I live in the area :)</Text>

We come here for the bahn mi. Best anywhere. Bread is impossibly fresh as are the veggies. Iced tea is included and the prices are the most reasonable anywhere. The place is very tiny and sometimes there's no place to sit, and parking can be trying as well, but it's totally worth the trip. The owners are very nice and accommodating. Love this place.<//text>

Fantastic food, super friendly service, what more can you ask for?

My fiancé and I came by for lunch the other day and both had the BBQ pork sandwich. Not only was the bread amazing (crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside) but the sandwich came with little cookies and we got free iced tea too!

The food is good enough to make this a regular place on my short list, but the service was so friendly I feel like I need to yell everyone it should be on their short list too!</Text>

What a nice little sandwich shop with the best service. I came here with my friend who brought her two little kids, and while my friend was waiting for me to come, the owner brought out some tea for her. When we arrived, she helped put two tables together so the four of us could eat together. Service was spectacular, sandwiches were less than $5, and the food was good. I got the house sandwich which you can get with a white or wheat roll. We got one of each, and both were delicious. I'll definitely come again for a quick meal.</text>

<Date>1485480011190< /Date><review>This is going to be a strange way to describe a Vietnamese banhmi shop, but this is not like any other banh mi shop (any that I've been to at least). Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by shop owners Vu and his sister Anne, and the other smiley gentleman who made my sandwich in the kitchen. While Vu was kindly going over the menu with me, I was overcome with a sense of peacefulness.. maybe it was the 4pm sun coming through the windows, the old school purple barstools and purple orchids on every table, or even his white hair which made you feel like you were talking to a wise sage. Anyway, I was already having a good experience just ordering my house special sandwich (#1) when it gets even better! His sister comes out from the back and greets me with a bowl of buttery sugary toast and an iced jasmine tea saying she was so happy that I came and wishing me a happy Vietnamese new year and everything. And even when my sandwich came out, the owner handed it to me with both hands and a small head bow, and let me tell you, if you've never felt this level of kindness and respect from a food joint, you need to come experience this for yourself. And since I wasn't expecting so many goodies, I had so many things to carry, so without hesitation, Anne picked everything up, walked me to my car and opened my door for me! I left feeling so taken care of hahah. And later I found two extra cookies in my bag. Anyway, the sandwich was awesome and I like that you can use your debit card here. I know this review was longer than usual, but I had to share my awesome experience. Much gratitude to Sandwich House, I will definitely be coming back soon.<//review></record>

Friendly customer service, qualified mechanics, competitive prices, commercial fleet vehicles are serviced at a discounted rate. The cons: too many cars in the parking lot are waiting for service, be prepared to spend quite some time if you're having a major repair, even if they have the parts on hand, you're warned.<//Review>

< Review>
Recently updated to reflect a few recent terrible visits (between 10/01/18 to 12/30/18). Employees have become very rude since I first started coming here earlier in the year. Seem to be more interested in "starting their own brewery" then assisting customers either in person or over the phone (called once to ask to confirm if yeast was in stock and rather then help me the employee insisted I didnt buy my yeast from them rather then answer my question... k?). Seem to always be out of important ingredients, such as most varieties of yeast, and never seem to have the specialty malts I need on-hand. I'll just be going back to Pacific Brewing supplies in San Dimas from now on. Was good while it lasted.</Review>

I called the shop because they were listed as a dealer for some bikes I was looking at purchasing.  I got connected with Jack and he was very helpful and professional.  Our conversation went to email where Jack sent me all the info I was looking for.  They had bikes in stock that were in my budget range.  The purchase was smooth and the shop was super helpful at pickup time.  Thanks again.  Highly Recommended.<//review>

What can I say that hasn’t been said already? This is by far the best bike shop in OC. I went here on a recommendation from a friend who purchased a bike from Pro Bike and from the very beginning I was blown away by the staff. I demoed a few bikes and talked with Nico, Matty, and Arin about what I wanted in my bike and they all provided very helpful input. Arin was amazing at figuring out how to get what I wanted at very reasonable prices.

Mark (the owner) is a top notch guy as well. He’s helped me personally a couple times and it’s great to see him in there doing the work along side the rest of the crew.

I recommend the shop to every person I know looking for a bike. I’m a customer for life.< /review>

I ordered a fork for my bike that on the website  stated it would ship in a couple weeks. My credit card was charged immediately, but I received an email a few hours later explaining the item was out of stock, and would not ship for a couple of months instead of a couple weeks because it was back ordered. I was asked if I wanted to wait, or to be refunded. The following morning I checked their website and it had not been updated, still saying available to ship in a couple weeks. I looked some more around their site hoping to find a suitable replacement. I came across a fork for approximately 25% more, but had a feature I wanted, and to be honest I would have ordered this fork originally had I seen it. This fork is listed as in stock, ready to ship. Now I am happy because things seem like they will work out for the better. I was prepared to pay the difference and have them send me the more expensive fork. Again, I receive an email apologizing, but that fork is also out of stock. She included a link to the only fork they do have in stock for my bike, but the link is to the fork I am trying to replace. I asked for a refund, and received an email almost immediately stating I had been refunded. I checked my credit card acct more than 48 hours later, no pending refund. After another email I am assured the refund was processed, and I should be receiving it shortly, which I did. It seems as if the only part of this operation that runs efficiently is the part that takes your money. As far as keeping items in stock, or at least keeping their website updated is not a priority. Even refunds are at a snails pace, especially when compared to the lightning speed at which your credit card is charged. Never again.</Review>

Some online retailers have the ability to simply authorize your card when you place an order and then charge you once it ships. We are unable to do this as authorizations have a limited time frame to them and would therefore make it difficult for us to do pre-orders or backorders.\nYour credit card processor then takes a few days to make the funds available to you. We don\'t agree with this system either, but this is just how online credit processors work.\nPlease let us know if you are still in need of a fork and we will do our best to try and see if we have anything in stock (we have over 70 forks currently in stock) that meets your specs and budget.\n\nThanks,\nPro Bike Supply'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

Unfortunately, Pro Bike Supply disregarded an agreement I made with them on a Thursday evening and sold the bike on Friday morning without giving me ample warning or any warning that our "agreement" could be canceled. The manager refused to apologized and spoke down to me - highly unprofessional. I recommend using another bike shop. This "Pro" Bike Supply lacks professionalism through and through.</Text>

<resp>{'time': 1617748016079, 'text': "Hi Kyle, we would like to apologize for your negative experience but you should be more honest with your review. You were provided with a PayPal invoice (an offer to purchase a used bike, but not a binding agreement) which you received, opened and then didn't pay for. After 24 hours you still hadn't paid for the bike and we had someone who was willing to pay on the spot. The owner of the shop then called you, apologized and tried to make the situation right with a discount on a new bike as well as the first crack on a comparable used bike. Instead of acknowledging the offer you just went on and on about how we had a legal contract, which is false, and then hung up on him and didn't respond to his email. We understand that you are disappointed that you didn't get the bike you wanted and in hindsight we should have gotten your cell phone number so we could call and let you know someone was willing to buy the bike if you didn't pay right away, but we unfortunately didn't have your number. This is just like going into a car dealership and negotiating a price but instead of signing the contract you went home to think about it and we sold the car to someone else. There was no obligation for you to complete the purchase and there was no contract that we had to sell you the bike. Our offer still stands to help you find something comparable and we have updated our invoice with more specific terms.  Thanks, Pro Bike Supply"}< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd2009a9099a6f:0x2d7d51ec1c507eaa</GmapID></record>

When you advertised a item, it shall be available in the inventory or shall be advertised as a preorder or back order. Very misleading, order place, my account charge, funds withdraw from my account - next day I received a email that my order would not be fill in 2 - 3 months.

Very bad business practices< /Review>

I normally support my LBS but due to the pandemic, I decided to shop online.  To my disappointment, several shops I contacted seemed too busy and unresponsive.  Fortunately, with the help of social media, I found Pro Bike supply.
This place rocks!  Extremely knowledgeable, professional and patient.  They were super responsive and guided me to the best option available. I would highly recommend them for any high end bike or component need.
Thank you PBS!!! Now I have a “go to” online bike shop.  👍< /review>

When stellar customer service in the bike biz really matters, Arin and the rest of the team at Pro Bike Supply really go the extra miles and know mountain biking parts. builds and bikes. Especially in this time of C-19 it’s good to have a pro bike that simplifies everything and with prompt shipping all at a great price</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>First time working with Pro Bike Supply and I’ll be a customer for life. I was in the market for a new bike, Revel brand in particular, and I noticed that they were the only authorized dealer in Orange County. Due to unusual circumstances with Covid-19, I reached out by email to get some more info and the rest was history. Arin hooked me up with an epic build and got me on the trails ASAP. I have nothing but positive things to say about working with the crew at Pro Bike Supply. Customer service is top notch and they have a great selection of bikes and parts to choose from.< /Text>< Pictures>

These guys build the best custom bikes. All the employees ride and love all things mountain biking. Super knowledgeable, but friendly not stuck up...just want more people riding awesome bikes. Demoed a few bikes from them before starting my build. They were super patient with me after multiple visits and tons of email back and forth as I made my final decisions. Bike turned out better than I expected. Also they have fast and complete service.  Even got me in and out of there a couple times on walk in service in less than an hour. Can’t say enough< /review>

Was servicing my rockshox monarch and ran into a few hiccups. Tried my go to shop in Costa Mesa and they recommended me to Pro Bike Supply due to the complexity of the service. Niko completed the process on my shock. Would recommend for any serious work on your mtb.< /Review>

<text>Disappointed. Found a 2020 Fox Float DPS shock on sale at Pro Bike Supply and placed the order.  The next day I received an e-mail indicating that the shock was no longer in stock but I could wait a month with no clear ship date and get the 2021 version for the same sale price.  Wonderful - I can wait a whole month during prime mountain biking season and hope to get the newer shock at some nebulous time in the future.  Or, bait and switch time, they will allow me to upgrade to the shinier version for $100 more and I'll get it sooner.  Still not the best part...  They also charged my credit card for the shock with the transaction posting to my account.  Isn't it customary to ship items before charging the credit card?  I mean everyone else does but maybe Pro Bike Supply dances to the beat of a different drummer.  Needless to say, I will go elsewhere in the future.</text>< pictures>

{'time': 1594833743206, 'text': 'Hi Matt,\n\nFirstly, we apologize that we ran out of stock.\nWe do not have control over our distributors and their stock levels and although we do our best to keep our stock count as accurate as possible, due to logistical issues with production and shipping and COVID restrictions we can only do so much.\nYou placed your order with us on July 13th. We reach out to you to let you know about the stock change on July 14th. We offered you a free upgrade to a 2021 model, at no additional charge, but told you it would only be available in mid-august due to the COVID induced logistics issue.  We offered you another option that would be $100 more, only if you were interested in the item, our intention was to give you another option. The only reason this shock was more expensive is because it was a completely different style of shock with an external reservoir and the additional $100 included a 15% discount.  In addition, we offered you a full refund if neither option worked for you. We are sad that you chose to write this as a review instead of reaching out to us, as our only intention with you and every other customer is to take care of you and offer you the best customer service we can under the current conditions.. We have issued you a full refund and again we apologize.  We are a family run business and we take immense pride in the service we provide.\nPlease feel free to reach out to us and we hope we will have opportunity to help you in the future.'}</resp>

In an effort to bring down our lead time we instituted a very temporary filter on what bikes we were taking into service. If you speak with our mechanics we are now taking in bikes regardless of where they were purchased. Unfortunately due to the scarcity of parts we are unable to work on older bikes, beach cruisers or city bikes.

<Review>Discovered this place online and ordered through the phone after doing a little quick research. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to order from PRO BIKE SUPPLY. Their service has been top notch and they shipped everything out immediately for me. When I received my frame, Yeti had shipped out the wrong fork with the frame, PRO BIKE SUPPLY overnighted me the correct fork from their shop to fix the problem. They’ve always responded incredibly quickly and have been extremely pleasant. I can’t recommend them enough!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I visited this shop while on vacation. I emailed them about a saddle  and they got back to me within the hour. I later went to the shop and was greeted by a very helpful shop worker. He found the saddle I was looking for and even provided very helpful sizing information. The shop isn’t very large but had a great selection of bikes, and gear. I’ll certainly be visiting this shop when I’m back in the area.< /review>

Pro Bike Supply is the best bike store I have ever been to. The team are incredibly helpful, knowledgable and friendly. This is a store of riders that care about your total riding experience and well being. That's something that is almost non-existent these days. Bravo!< /review>

After checking out several bikes and bike shops all across orange county I was most satisfied with the customer service offered at Pro Bike Supply. They have great expertise on the bikes they sell and I really feel like they try and take good care of their customers. From the very first time I walked in to demo a bike, I was instantly taken care of by Nico. He was just super awesome to work with and I really appreciate the time he spent with me choosing my bike/build. Looking forward to getting my new ride dialed in!<//review>

<Text>If you live in the Newport Beach - Cost Mesa area, I don't know why you would have your bike serviced anywhere else.  To say this is The Best shop I have ever encountered is a huge understatement.  My bike service was everything I asked for and more.  Believe my bike is actually running better now than when it was brand new.  Nico did my work but am sure all technicians are top notch - please support them as this type of service and integrity needs to be honored with tons of business...</Text>< Pics>

I’ve purchased from other shops in OC, and while they’re good, the customer focus and experience at ProBike is superior.  Mark, Arin and Niko are friendly and always eager to help.  Prices are competitive, and their knowledge and patience to get you dialed in are impressive.  I’m extremely selective about my bike and setup, to a fault, and I couldn’t imagine going anywhere else after the consistently great service I’ve received on my new Ripmo I bought there.  Niko recently helped me fine tune my suspension and just nailed it.  Overall you’ll sense the air of generosity of this shop.  Can’t say enough good things about ProBike.  Go check it out.</Text>

<Review>These guys exceeded my expectations by far...I really cannot say enough good things to describe the experience I had while doing business with them. I live in Puerto Rico and got a "dream build" from Newport Beach, California. Every detail of the deal was as smooth as it could be. If that does not tell you the story. Go an visit them!!! I forgot, you do not have to visit them...just pick up your phone and give them a ring. It could be the "cycling-call" of your life...

Sincerely,

What you saw was us following the current COVID-19 recommendations from the CDC and keeping our doors closed,as we are accepting one person in the store at at time , with cleaning protocol between customers and most customers making reservations before coming in. We take the safety of our team and our customers very seriously. I hope you will consider revising your review with that in mind and we would be more than happy to help you. Again, apologies if it wasn't clear to you that we are open. Please email us at orders@probikesupply.com for further assistance and to set up a time for service."}< /response>

< Review>
THIS. IS. THE. BEST. PLACE. EVER!

This place never disappoints.

SCRATCH THAT.

The only time this place has disappointed me is when it's been CLOSED.

My go-to meal is the chicken combo which normally comes with, shredded chicken, beans, rice, radishes, tortillas, and - if wanted - onions,  and cilantro. Lately, I've been asking for the combos just with the chicken in whole pieces with no beans and double rice. See the Plato de Pollo pic below.

By the way... I am so thankful that I will NEVER have to admit to my late grandfather that I've found a roast chicken that tastes better than his! It is so moist, tender, and flavorful!

And the rice?!?!?!?! Praise him! If I'm running errands, I'll stop in just for an 8 oz. cup - only $2, yall!

Oh, yeah! The combos come with a fountain drink, but only if you

WEAR. A. MASK!<//Review>

Love taco Tuesdays! They are super generous with the portions and its delicious. The salsa is bomb and it's my husband's favorite local spot for tacos de tripa. I am more of a carne asada or ribs kinda gal but they have a variety of meats to try.</text>

I love coming to El Toro Bravo. This location opening up is a bit more convenient for me than going to the one down the street haha. I always get the small order of carne asada nachos. I LOVE their nachos. Sometimes they run out of a certain meat aka chicharons or carne asada. When I think they have enough carne asada, I have a heart attack when the the dude in front of me orders it by the pound.  Thankfully they haven't ran out on me JUST yet.<//review>

Tacos not as good as the the tortilla shop down the street. I'm assuming they're affiliated, same name and logo. Meat has no flavor, taco was completely bland, but it was full of meat.<//review>

I had a change of heart. I cheated on my usual Mexican restaurant "Tacos Gavilan" in Santa Ana.
El Toro Bravo is now our first choice for really good Mexican food.
Great Job El Toro Bravo crew!!!<//text>

<text>This place does not use gloves when preparing food. They do not go to the sink to wash their hands before handling food after completing any other tasks. They also have about 4 delivery app iPads running but do not understand the concept of a delivery order coming in. I stood there for 20 minutes while the team refused to communicate with each other and also myself. I asked the cashier to look at the iPad for the delivery order and the whole team switched out looking at it acting as if they’d never looked at it before. I can’t understand how they stay open without the health inspector shutting them down. They have a door dash sign in front of the register and it’s dirty. Dirty enough to think that they should be at least a little experienced with expediting an order. This is no way to run a business. I’m appalled.</text>< Pictures>

The man serving him was very rude and more interested in watching the soccer game than doing his job.   He tried to wrap up the tacos without even topping them with salsa and was rude when he asked for it.  We were then charged $8.00  for a 32 oz rice which grubhub lists as 6 something and all the tacos we were charged $3 for when the menu states 2.70.. there was no extra toppings like sour cream or guacamole it’s a difference of a few dollars but it was rude.  The food is good but the service sucked and surprise charges were not fair. Not going back to this location again!< /review><Rate>1< /Rate>< time>

OG Mexican food. If you have an appetite for authentic Mexican food and drinks, then you need to make sure El Toro Bravo is your next destination!! The tacos are flavorful, plentiful and customizable. The chips are the perfect partner to both the salsa and the guacamole. One of the best Horchatas I have had in a long time!!</Review>

Just had the Nachos Carne Asada! It was a meal in itself. With the refried beans, queso blanco, cilantro, onions, avocado dip, pico de gallo and their own tortilla chips, I was stuffed! Very reasonable pricing too.</Text>

Been stuck in Costa Mesa for several days now and this is the best place for Mexican food. Big portions and inexpensive. The combo meal comes with a drink which is great since it's already alot of food for the price. Would DEFINITELY recommend anyone wanting tacos burritos nachos anything like that to go here. It's worth the money and they are sooooo nice. They have other locations as well so hit them up<//Text>

<Review>The food is really good love the tacos and burritos, but beware the do run out of items. They also sell meat by the pound if you wanna make your own tacos. The place can be described as cozy (take out when coming with a group). The portion sizes are good. They accept credit cards and debit as well. They deliver on items of 75 if you are into not leaving the house and have guest over. So far pretty good except for the remains of the old tokio grill are still here.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>The only reason I went to this one was because the other one had a long line out the door. Asked for carne asada nachos they gave me the left over chips (little pieces with about 10 regular chips) that were stale, they then over loaded the chips with hot sauce. Next time I'm just waiting in line at their other location.<//review><userid>116319591710064215562</userid><resp>None<//resp></record>

Love this place.  Very unassuming but Wow the food and is good.

I go to El Toro Bravo for 2 different reasons and needs (yes I have food needs 😋):
1. For lunch or dinner and get usual fare: tacos, burritos, tortas etc. and they taste great.
2. Meat by the pound, cooked to perfection.

Case in point...bought a pound of carnitas and one of carne asada for dinner at home with friends.  I also.pixked up some guac and salsa.

Got home, got the tortillas out and the warmer, some cilantro and chopped onions
and made Bueno tacos for the group.

The carnitas is my fav, so juicy and tender...they chop it up before they package it...

Yum, try it out, you won't be dissapointed.</text>

I used to love the other location, stopped in here for some tacos. Ordered chicken enchiladas for my friend. Was told they don’t have enchiladas. It’s on the menu. So I asked for chicken taquitos. Was told they have NO chicken period. Ok, how bout potato taquitos? Nope. The guy was clearly annoyed and told me , ‘hey, look it’s really busy.’  My friend says I’ll have a bean tostada. That turns out to be bean nachos with no cheese. As we’re eating the food they did have they start selling chicken again. Chicken tacos, chicken tamales, chicken everything. A simple ‘ can you wait 5 minutes for the chicken to be done? ‘ would’ve done just fine. Never eating here again.<//review>

A Costa Mesa landmark with lots of carne, of all varieties, and they do not skimp on the portions. Fresh tortillas and chips... Always!</Review>

Worst burrito ice ever had.  Completely obvious that the beans in the meat were not fresh from today.  Although it was the biggest burrito I ever had.  And the most expensive at just over $8.  Do not recommend at all</Review>

We drove around forever trying to find a good place to eat since we are not from around here it was pretty hard.  When we spoted this place we didn't think much of it. But afterwards we were so happy we found this place. The moment we walked in we fell in love with the smell of the food. We were so impatient to wait for my brothers to order all together that we just decided to order without them. First of all the tacos were HUGE! They serve a lot of meat on the tacos and that was a plus for us. We tried the alpastor which was good but not as good as the carnitas tacos. Those were bomb! And the salsas had a really good flavor! Everyone there was really nice! We loved it so much we went back at night before they closed and again it was really really good!<//Text>

Excellent service & food!  My husband & I love these smaller Mexican restaurants & this one is our new favorite.  The cook was very accomidating to my nutritional needs (Ketogenic friendly) by creating a burrito bowl for me,  even though it's not on their menu. The carne asada was fantastic & juicy. Not dry at all. My husband got a bean & cheese burrito & was able to add yummy guacamole . He loved his burrito too. Extremely reasonably priced. I eveb have some left overs that I'm looking forward to devouring later. If I could give more stars,  I would.</review>

I ordered some food from the el toro bravo on maple and 19th and when I got home my carnitas were very dry like jerky and I called up the other el toro bravo because I didn't know the number to the one on maple and they told me that the one on maple isn't even the same owner and that explains why my food tasted so disgusting and I have been going to the other el toro bravo for years, I would not recommend coming to this place unless you like low grade Mexican food if I could give you no stars I would</Review>

In my review of the El Toro Bravo tortilleria, I gave it a "4" for the food and service but dinged it for the relatively drab location.  Enter their new restaurant a few blocks down the street, which actually has the vibrance that the other location lacks while maintaining the same commitment to service and delicious food.  I'm a hefty dude, and even I get stopped in my tracks by the food portions they offer here and often take home the rest for seconds.  If you get a combo plate (asada, pollo, or carnitas), make sure you buy a bag of chips to go with it - Just makes the experience even better.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad experience To begin with, the bigoton taquero is half bitter with few words not to deal with the cold tortillas with customers, the meat is equally cold and the nachos do not put melted cheese

(Original)

(Translated by Google) Here if you like tacos, with only two have. The only bad thing is that they do not clean the tables. Only three stars.

I’ve been to Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia multiple times. This is hands down the best Thai food I have ever eaten. No question. I frequently visit the sequoias and this will be the only stop I make on the way from now on.</Review>

This place was just awesome the staff was very helpful and friendly and the food was excellent. I was never really a Thai food fan but eating here will definitely make me a East Meets West fan. My wife had the Pad Thai with shrimp and I black pepper and garlic beef definitely a reorder. They have all kinds of food and it all looked good. They are well worth giving them a try.< /Text>

I go there for the cheesecake because its difficult to find good pastries in my neighborhood. The menu is plentiful with food both from the East and West.</text>

Avoid this place. Garden hose coffee, rubber bacon, and translucent eggs. I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed with things I paid for and willing placed in my mouth. I literally spit the coffee back into the cup.<//review>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>Interesting mix of Thai and American menu items. VERY clean and a pleasant atmosphere, although just by the decor you'd have no idea they had an Asian menu: Looks much more like a down-home, country breakfast place (Which it is...  But, you can get some pretty decent Pad Thai, as well...).<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Easy in and easy out. Their breakfasts are standard American fare but prepared much better than a chain restaurant such as Denny's. I always order "fresh fruit" in place of hash browns. This place really has fresh fruit as compared to many other restaurants who get their "fresh fruit" out of a can.< /Review>< date>

Great tasting food, freshly made to order. Mom and Pop shop so you know service is genuine even if it isn't fast.
Great variety in the menu- American cuisine to Chinese to Thai!
Great place, great people, great food, great prices.</review>

Can't say enough good things about this place. Amazing Thai food! and home made pie! The crust was so good! Friendly service, beautiful atmosphere. The kitchen and the servers put a lot of love into that place. Large portions and good quality for the price. So worth the stop in.<//Review>

<Text>We ordered eggs Benedict, western omelet & pancakes. I have to say first of all that it was 90 degrees with the doors shut & no AC at noon!  The eggs Benedict was hard cooked with very bland hollandaise.  My husband said his omelet was the same, no flavor.  My son liked his pancakes (it’s hard to screw up syrup.). We also had teas & an orange juice w/the pancakes.  The bill came to $47 for Breakfast!! before tip .  We felt bad for the waitress!<//Text><rating>2< /rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

East Meet West Restaurant, 224 North Kaweah, Exeter, CA.
Formerly known as Carole's Restaurant, there is a continuity of ownership and experience. All my friends and I eat there regularly, always with good food and excellent service. The chef is amazing, working with a large menu of American and Asian items, and the service personnel is always friendly and helpful.</review>

<text>Ordered the Chicken salad and got what looked to be a sliced half of a chicken breast, chopped up head of iceberg lettuce, a cold hard-boiled egg, "peanut sauce" that was pretty much inedible due to the strong, unappealing flavor, two small slices of tomato, and two generous rings of white onion.

Service was OK but was really expecting more.</text></record>

I deal with Kevin at Portfolio Service contracts quite frequently due to my position at work. Besides being very knowledgeable and proficient at his job. He actually takes the time to listen and has genuine care when dealing with me, even though we deal on a business level. (He has remembered previous conversations and takes the time to ask questions about those conversations, which shows he actually listens.)
I have emailed and called Kevin on several occasions and his response time is as close to immediate as you can get and if not within a few minutes it is a call with an apology for not getting back the same day, because he was off.
I would definitely recommend Portfolio Service contracts to anyone looking for an extended “warranty”, because they are easy to deal with and work very hard at honoring their contracts for the dealerships.<//review>

Absolutley the worst customer service and service all around. My vehicle has been sitting in the shop over a week. Everyday we are told the warranty inspector is coming out and everyday they are a no show. The dealership is losing money on the space my truck is taking up and I am losing money on Ubers. They cant even approve for me to be in a rental at this point. Thousands of dollars for a warranty and for what? What a joke! The one star is too generous.<//Text>

Would be Zero Stars if that were possible as a rating. We purchased a Tahoe From Murdock Chevrolet in Bountiful, Utah in November 2017. Paid for Gap Insurance. January 6th 2020, We were run off the road by a car trying to pass illegally. Rolled 4 times - Tahoe Totaled. The GAP Insurance, we purchased to Protect us Never Paid. We have resubmitted the claims at least 20+ times. THEY ARE FRAUDS! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! DO NOT BUY GAP FROM PORTFOLIO! THEY LIE, LOOSE PAPERWORK AND NEVER EVER PAY OUT A CLAIM!!!! THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS AND MURCOCK CHEVROLET WAS NO HELP EITHER! BOTH ARE TERRIBLE. I HAD TO PAY THE DEPRECTION DIFFERENCE FROM THE LOAN.<//Text>

<Name>Paul Erickson</Name><Review>I am so pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Shelby at Portfolio. Of all my years of working with various customer service representatives,  she was by far the most helpful person I've had the pleasure to work with. Shelby was very kind, informative and showed she really cared about me and my needs. I was very impressed and wanted to take the time to share my gratitude.  I truly wish all service representatives could learn from Shelby! Thanks so much for everything! Keep up the good work!!! 🙂🙂🙂</Review>< date>

<Text>I needed one less document to complete my claim. Spoke to customer service they said to call the dealership and get the information from them. I did,  and they referred me to my paperwork. I explained that I needed some thing in writing and they refused. II email the paperwork and of course it wasn’t enough so I called again. Fortunately I spoke to Leeanne who was a super hero to me! She offered to call and she got them to take care of the paperwork needed to complete my claim. I enjoyed speaking to her over the phone. She was very personable, understanding and went above and beyond to help me out. I give her5+ Stars!!  Thank you again for your help Leanne I truly appreciate it.

BEWARE they erase bad reviews & really deserve NO STARS!  Still waiting for the warranty refund on my car deemed a total loss back in Nov 2019, yet it is now March 2021!  All I get after placing numerous calls & emails to them is runaround or no response at all.  They finally sent me a check they quickly canceled because it was supposed to go to the dealer instead.  Never corrected their mistake.  WHERE IS MY MISSING CHECK WORTH OVER $1,000?!  Do not give them your $business$!!!</Review>

This was the 1st time I dealt with Portfolio. I was extremely impressed! Customer Sevice Representative JoLynn did a fabulous job explaining to me the cancellation & refund process. She was patient and a total professional. I called because we sold our vehicle and I cancelled the policy with the dealership (as required by the Agreement). The dealership sent me a cancellation acknowledgement but nothing else - no check, no explanation of the process. Just a piece of paper that stated it was an official cancellation notice with a refund amount listed. We had problems with the dealership not being upfront & honest - along with sliding into financing items to which we did not agree. I called the dealership who told me that Portfolio would send them the refund and then they (the dealership) would reimburse us. Portfolio CS representative calmed my fears, she assured me the request had been received and explained the process. She also did a great job explaining how they handle claims - which assured me we had purchased a great product - however, we no longer had the vehicle and asked for the unused portion of the Agreement be refunded. Portfolio took my information and told me to give them a call if I did not receive our refund within 30 days. Portfolio treated me as a very valued customer. In the future BEFORE I buy a new car, I will make sure Portfolio has an agreement with the dealership, and purchase the extended warranty agreement. Just with this interchange I believe Portfolio is a wonderful company, honest and stands by their words & products. I look forward to doing business with them in the future.</Text>

I was struggling with the claims process as the first person I spoke with sent me to a website to complete a bunch of detail that is apparently meant only for dealerships.  I had to call the dealership to get the information and ultimately I couldn’t get the form to submit as I kept receiving an error message.  When I called back, I spoke with Sofia and she was SUPER helpful and stayed on the phone with me to get the claim information filled out and submitted.  I’m super grateful I’m these types of situations to find someone helpful and friendly and Sofia was great!!  Overall the process was confusing because of the misinformation I received on the first call but Sofia got me sorted out!</review>

I have been working with The Portfolio Group 10 plus years.  This past couple years have been the best and it's getting better.  I have worked closely with several of the staff as well as the Account Managers who have stopped by to ask if there is anything I need or could do to help us.  The claims I submit are paid faster than any other extended warranty group I have worked with.  Anyone out there looking to work with this company will not be disappointed.

< review>
My 2020 Honda Civic was hit by someone who ran a red light. The Gap insurance didn’t help pay the balance from what I owed after what the insurance paid, (which was surprisingly only about 755 after the last payment I made.) They DID refunded the extended warranty and that is what covered what I owed, NOT Guaranteed Asset Protection. When I called back and asked why, I was told that because of a total loss the GAP was fulfilled. Their contract is such BS!! It is a very shady way to do business. They advertise that they will cover what’s owed in a total loss, but when that accident actually happens you are SOL. Better have that Extended Warranty!

Before getting any type of coverage from them, don’t just look at the google reviews, look at Reddit, look at consumer affairs.com please do your research on them first!!</review>

My finance company fax over my gap packet Feb 8th gap claim they never received  the documents and I have had the documents to be fax over Nemours times again ana again and they claim to never receive  them. Then they would say there fax machine acts up sometimes this made me furious how does a million dollar company has such a improper working fax machine but after calling day in and day out I finally go in touch with someone named Megan who took the time to listen  to my problem and try to come up with a solution  she not only got everything taken care of that day she got me moved  to the top of the list and my left over care balance  was paid off in to two days so thanks Megan you  really save your company behind.< /Text><rate>3</rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
I purchased a 5year warranty on my 2012 Buick Enclave. Then sold the car less than 2 years later, without any claims being made. I then called Portfolio in Dallas and had the good fortune of somehow being directed to Alesha Hunter.  Alesha is the type of person that by the tone of her voice and helpful attitude inspires confidence and trust. Alesha walked me through the necessary paperwork and process which was complicated by the pandemic, the snowstorm and power outage in Dallas , the Dealer where i had purchased the Warranty being sold and the check being misdirected or lost. Through all this Alesha was  totally professional . I felt that with Alesha handling the matter I did not need to worry about the outcome ,which for someone 83 is difficult. This past Thursday morning I called Alesha to tell her that I had just picked up the check for $996.28 at the Dealer in Wilmington. I was very disappointed when she did not answer, so I left her a voice mail Thanking her for her help. Alesha emailed me within minutes thanking me for letting her know.  I was gone at the time but called her the next morning to personnaly thank her. I felt she was as happy as I was -----like she had received the money also! In closing , I don't know how many employees Portfolio has , but if you have somemore like Alesha Hunter, you future is assured and secure.Sincerely, Ron Roughton<//Review>

I had cancelled my extended warranty with Wayne Mazda in early November when I purchased a new car.  I reached out to them several times via email and phone to receive no response.  Frustrated, I called Portfolio (number on the cancellation form).  I spoke with Alesha Hunter. She asked me to email her a copy of my cancellation form.  Within in 24 hours, she was able to inform me that the dealership still hadn't submitted the cancellation to Portfolio.  I then called Mazda to speak with the manager.  Finally, the steps were taken to process my refund.  It is February and I still haven't received my refund.  I emailed Alesha instead of trying the dealership.  She emailed me within the day to tell me the cancellation form had been processed and I should receive a refund.  She was a breath of fresh air.  I really appreciated the fact that Portfolio and Alesha responded to inquiries.  I usually shy away from posting reviews but I gladly volunteered to post this review.  Thank you Portfolio and Alesha Hunter.
A grateful customer,
Jung Yi< /review>

Since I moved from the city in which I purchased my car, finding a service provider in my area that will work with this company has been difficult. It seems they are well known for being difficult. After finding a small shop that is patient enough to attempt the claims process, I find myself waiting over a week to have a claim processed for a repair that is clearly covered by looking at my copy of the agreement, and can be completed within 1 day. After 7 days of hearing nothing from Portfolio, it takes phone calls from both the service provider and myself to have it "expedited" and "sent to management" to be REVIEWED.

I can't imagine why they find it appropriate to keep policy owners without their vehicles for that long. I would have rather they rejected my claim within a reasonable timeframe so that I could have made alternative arrangements with another repair service provider, knowing how difficult that would be. Clearly they are looking for ways to avoid paying for repairs that they agreed to cover rather than working to provide the warranty service that the unfortunate agreement holder paid for.

Anyone considering this company's "service" should look harder for a more reputable 3rd party auto warranty. I give 2 stars only because the people on the phones that have no part in the actual claims process have been generally well-mannered.</Review>

Alesha Hunter helped me with my issue. She was outstanding and very professional. My issue was a warranty refund because I traded in my car. The dealer was very dishonest and lied to me claiming they filed the cancellation paperwork. They never did. I may never have received my money if not for the help of Portfolio and their customer service. Thanks.</text>

<review>The process took longer than I wanted but it really was more on the car insurance and the dealership on the warranty stuff. Once all that was taken care of, I was able to easily get all my documents to Portfolio. Once I had them all in, the review went pretty fast. They paid and notified me. I saw an issue, I responded and they got right on it. They reviewed and paid and explained all the questions and concerns I had. Even offered more assistance if I needed it. Megan was terrific and followed-up when she felt too much time had lapsed. Great customer service. Same goes for Jason. He was right on it. Sent me info, I asked a questions and he responded asap. Very quick and great customer service.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Working with Portfolio and the claims administrator, Enrique Torres, has made a difficult task easy.  When I call with a question Enrique always responds quickly, and is always so helpful!  Today I called with a follow up question on something I worked with him months ago on; he remembered all the details of the claim and had the answer.  It’s not every day you get that personalized customer service experience, and certainly not ever day I write reviews, but THIS I had to share!</Review>< Name>

<Review>I have been a service consultant for many years and my least favorite thing has been having to contact extended warranties. I have always hated it, normally they argue with you and keep you on hold for way to long. Portfolio turned it all around for me and really sets the bar high for any other company. Anytime I have to deal with portfolio/express the experience has been very pleasant and expedited. I'm always happy to see a portfolio contract. My last experience has been with Elizabeth Roman who went above and beyond with helping me throughout the process and restored my faith on the way extended warranties processes should be. If all extended warranties followed in their footsteps the world would be a better place. Thank you!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1582934042972, 'text': "Hi , Wow!

I have been with Finance Concepts for just under 6 years and have interacted with Deana Greulich countless times. She has always been extremely helpful. There have been times when she shouldn't have been my point of contact and instead of saying something like, " It's not my job" she would merely forward my questions to the correct person to assist me or find the solution I was needing. I appreciate her professionalism and knowledge of the business. I look forward to continuing our work relationship.<//review>

<Review>We were having a difficult time with Orr Cadillac. We had traded a car we purchased from them and had requested a refund for the unused portion of the extended warranty and gap insurance. They were worse then simply being indifferent, they seemed to get pleasure out of passing us around from one person to another, and claiming that they did not have documentation we had already provided twice.

Finally after nearly two months of this, my wife contacted Portfolio and spoke to Enrique. He was great, and had our check to us the very same day.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>I contacted Portfolio to attempt to cancel several add-ons which affected my car financing.
The first agent gave me all the information I needed to begin canceling items.  Although, I was not told it could be done that day.  Instead, the agent said,” I would have to contact the car dealership business office to begin the cancellation”.  They have control over the paperwork.  Unable to reach the dealership business office for over a week..(they never called me), I contacted Portfolio a second time. This time I gave the agent my story and was given a website address to send a cancellation letter.
The dealership gave me my documents on a flash drive, once printed it did not have the entire copy of how to contact Portfolio for a cancellation.
Needless to say, I appreciate Portfolio customer service as now my items will be cancelled and taken off my car finance loan.
Now, I pray the dealership will refund my service agreement offered by Portfolio.  How they have this much power is ridiculous.  Why is it up to them to refund me and not the issuing company is unbelievable.

The overall customer service provided by Portfolio is outstanding. Everyone that I have worked with over the years is professional and reliable. Crystal is one of the most reliable and available people at Portfolio that I work with on a daily basis.  She always gets the requested task handled quickly and goes above and beyond what is expected. She is almost always available when I call with a request even before and after normal business hours, and if not, she promptly replies to my voicemails and emails. Crystal definitely is a very valuable asset to Portfolio and does an incredible job exceeding normal customer service expectations which makes my job a ton easier and run much smoother. Thank you Portfolio and Thank you very much Crystal!<//review>

She also followed up to make sure the information provided to me was helpful. Also, in the same day, I dealt with Javier Ruiz regarding a remittance, and he was very quick with researching the question I asked and providing a solution. Overall, I would rate the Portfolio HQ in Lake Forest 10 stars if I could, as EVERYONE I’ve dealt with so far has been top notch! If you’re thinking about doing business with this company, I would question why you would even think of anyone else!! Portfolio is #1 in my book!</Text><userid>110696280453540136523<//userid></record>

I had better luck working with this company than I did with my own insurance or bank. They truly seemed to care about the importance of finalizing my GAP claim. Jason Huynh was very helpful and responded to my emails almost immediately. So I say a big THANKS to you all..👍Keep up the good work! The process they say can take up to 30 BUSINESS days. My claim only took about 4 weeks in total. Perhaps a little less, thanks.<//Review>

My experience with Portfolio has been great. Every time I call with an issue everyone has been eager to help. There has never been a time that I can recall of having a bad experience. I took on the warranty clerk position at my job four years ago and from that day up until now, everybody at portfolio has been awesome and very very patient. I appreciate each and everyone that has assisted me.  So keep up the good work, your service is appreciated.

They were fast in processing my claim.  I was totally surprised because of the rumors that I heard about the GAP process.  In addition, every single representative that I talked to was actually friendly and respectful.  I rarely see that in any company.</text>

I was unable to login to my account and contacted Crystal Young.  Very quickly emailed me the information I needed to get back into my account.  The next day I had an issue with a contract that needed to be voided and she walked me through the steps necessary to void the contract.

I had to utilize my Gap Insurance after what was one of the worst days of my life.  I spoke with several people during this process and was ALWAYS pleasantly surprised by the professional and WARM conversations.  I was blown away by that.  I felt like I was being guided through this process by a friend(s).  I certainly hope to never need gap insurance again (although I will never NOT buy it), but if I need it, I'm glad I have these folks.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>In 2017, I purchased a vehicle with Portfolio warranty. In 2018, I sold the vehicle and the dealership I purchased the vehicle from - was no longer in business. I made several attempts to contact the dealership to receive my prorated refund, but no luck after several months.

I contacted Portfolio directly and talked with Beverly Wilson, VSC Administrator. Beverly immediately followed up and apologized for  not processing the documentation in a timely manner. She followed up via email on a daily basis until the issue was resolved in a couple of days. She provided excellent customer service and went above and beyond to ensure the prorated check was a accurately processed. Thank you, Beverly for all YOU did!!!

I was close to canceling my current Portfolio warranty with the recent vehicle I purchased. Beverly is a keeper for Portfolio.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I would like to say that the customer service provided by Megan Mclellan was exceptional. She went above and beyond to assist me in a much complicated claim that I had. She took the time to research my claim and find the answers I needed. I feel that if it was not for her assistance my claim would still be in limbo. I really appreciated her time, effort, and follow up to make sure that I was a satisfied customer.<//Text>

We had a paperwork error between the dealership and Portfolio and after many calls to the dealership we contacted Portfolio directly and Enrique solved the problem in under 20 minutes!

< Review>
I would like to say how wonderful it has been to work with Brenda Hernandez on my claim. I had a horrific experience with the dealership (Dublin Hyundai) that I purchased my car and the protection package and maintenance plan. It has taken over 7 months with the dealership to get any resolution to our problem. But, with one phone call to Portfolio Performance and speaking with Brenda for five minutes, not only did she process my claim with the utmost expediency, she apologized for the dealership and for the situation I had to encounter.  She went above and beyond what her job duty called for!
Thank you to Brenda for reassuring that there is still human decency in this crazy world we now have to live in, and thank you to Portfolio Performance for the packages I purchased and for reimbursing me for my loss.</Review>

< review>
The worst thing about getting tire punctures from objects discarded onto the streets is that there's often nothing you can do to prevent them and they still require you to take hours of time from your day to rectify them. Knowing that Portfolio would be there to handle the cost was already an immediate alleviation of the financial stress of having a tire replaced, but the added bonus was the staff at Portfolio who answered my calls, sent me the forms, answered my questions, and promptly resolved my claims within minutes of filing my paperwork. I had the check in hand within days, never having to pay the charge to my credit card out of my own pocket. Just for the tire protection alone, Portfolio has been well worth the investment.< /review>

My tire light came on so I took my car to my dealer because they were just down the street from me and they found that I had a nail in the sidewall and needed replacement. The dealer then called Portfolio and in a short time, I had a new tire and was back on the road. The process was so fast and easy would recommend Portfolio to anyone.< /text>

I called Portfolio today to obtain information on a contract one of my clients had purchased from another dealership. The representative with whom I spoke, Jhoana Agreda, was truly exceptional! She was very welcoming, personable and professional and exceeded all expectations. In fact, I had barely hung up the phone before I received an email from Jhoana with the requested documents. Simply AWESOME!! The epitome of excellent customer service!  Thank you Jhoana and Portfolio...keep up the great work!!!<//review>

I have not had to use my extended warranty with Portfolio but this review is based on the interaction I had with one of their representatives. I spoke with a delightful and very knowledgeable Mrs. JoLynn in the TX office. I called in originally to receive some additional information about the product I was considering purchasing with our new vehicle purchase. The car dealer was unsure of some more specific questions, so I called Portfolio. After going around the phone tree, I ended up speaking Mrs. JoLynn (receptionist at the TX office) who went above and beyond the call of duty to answer all the questions I had about the extended warranty. She was so knowledgeable of the product, explained how the service works, even walked me through hypothetical situations and what the service would look like then. And as if she was reading my mind, told me exactly what page, box number and line item I needed to turn to see this in print on the application from the dealer. Mrs. JoLynn didn't have to take my call and could have sent me back into the phone tree to find a CSR but she didn't. She took the time to make sure I understood fully what I was purchasing and how everything works from start to finish. I ended up purchasing the extended warranty because of her wonderful explanation, her loyalty to the company, and her personal testimony of using the service herself. I understand that someone may rebut with "she has to say that, she works for the company." Allow me to explain; JoLynn exhibited so much class, good character, attention to detail, knowledge, and love for her Lord (let the reader understand), that she would never stick with or work this long for a crooked company. I have no doubt that if I ever do need to utilize this product, I won't have to worry about getting the runaround. Hopefully Portfolio will continue to hire outstanding people like Mrs. JoLynn!</Text>

I called the number on my contract and talked to a friendly representative who collected my information and requested that I send a picture of the damage.

She also ALWAYS follows up to insure that I got the answers I needed, each and every single time I speak with her! She is one of the most courteous and knowledgeable person I have encountered in my many years of working in office administration. She NEVER "passes the buck", as so many do so frequently. I know that in many instances, my issue belongs to a different department, yet, instead of passing me over to someone else or giving me another number to call, Alesha contacts the proper department herself and always gets back to me as quickly as possible, alleviating so many potential headaches for me. I wish I could clone Alesha and insert one of her in every single company with whom I do business!<//Review>< pics>

Filing claims can be a nightmare.
Customer Service and your internal personnel are helpful about cleaning it up. However it’s too late. Customers are already mad and time is wasted.
I’ve had a few repair facilities tell me they’re about ready to stop accepting these contract claims or already have. Which makes me cringe cause I know it’s a better company than this.<//review>

<review>Millie and Alesha helped me resolve a dilemma that started in 2016. I financed a car in March 2016, cancelled items on my purchase agreement the next day with the dealer, but come tax season 2019,  I found out that those items were neither processed nor cancelled by my dealer. Millie and Alesha helped me not only in cancelling those items and applying the principal to my loan balance, but they applied it to my 2016 balance, therefore forgiving any interest that had accrued on those items. Thank you so much Millie and Alesha!<//review><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

<Review>Great service!  When I found out that the failing (and now bankrupt) dealership I purchased my warranty through never submitted the contract to Portfolio and they pocketed money, I was worried that I would have to pay for my vehicle repairs myself!  In spite of this- Portfolio said they would still honor the contract, and Patricia worked quickly to get it into the system so I could get my vehicle fixed!

It's service like this that makes all the difference!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1527198670419, 'text': "We want to thank you for sharing your positive experience.

We understand that a total loss is a great hardship and going through a claims process can be difficult when it does not get settled to your satisfaction. Your claim was unfortunately delayed due to some variances with your Primary Insurance settlement. We communicated the information required to you on November 15, 2018. Fortunately, were able to collect the missing information from your Primary Insurance Company, on your behalf, and the claim is in processing for payment to your Lienholder. The GAP payment is scheduled to go out tomorrow. Regards, Maysoon Ben-Ghaly'}< /resp>

< Review>
I totaled my car 10/5, still waiting for my GAP insurance to figure this out. I have every form filled out, but yet they won't accept my paperwork, because my insurance didn't pay sales tax. I live in New Hampshire where there is NO STATE TAXES, this is a LAW. Yet they are having such a hard time trying to figure that out. I keep sending different information to try and get this through their fat heads, but it's "unacceptable." This runaround is pathetic, teach your employees different laws per state if you're gonna be a cross the country company.<//Review>

I have the same complaint Express Systems / Portfolio Inc that Adrian does. Not to mention they can't get straight, who provides what. They are going to get a 30 day notification  to pay up the money they claimed their service was "stress free"

I'm done dealing with you people trying to get 4388.93 (yes it went up and will go higher according to interest) But you people wont have to worry about seeing a judge until October. I guarantee it, if you don't pay the money owed to me.

Do not deal with ANY auto dealer that provides GAP insurance through this carrier. Do yourselves a favor and see if the financial institution handling your loan provides GAP coverage</Text>

<review>I really need to acknowledge Alesha Hunter as someone I received excellent customer service from. Between Thursday and Friday (8/1 and 8/2) I had been getting the run-around while trying to verify the receipt of my Portfolio Protection contract from the dealer I purchased my vehicle from, so that I could call in a claim. I spoke to person after person and spent over 3 fruitless hours on the phone during those two days only for me to stumble upon 5 pm CST Friday evening with nothing else that could be done.
So now comes Monday afternoon, I call and Alesha answers the phone. She could not locate my contract, but she actually goes as far as calling the dealer for me to get them to email her another copy of the contract. She then inputs the information into the system herself and emails me that the contract will be received by the Claims Department within 30 minutes. Why wasn't it this simple on Thursday or Friday? Thank you Alesha for stepping up and turning a bad situation for the good!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1565047655079, 'text': "Hi Cordell, we appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.

My father had aot of questions regarding the policy. Luckily, I spoke to Jose who not only helped me out, but my dad. My dad was very happy with the service he provided and is also happy knowing that he has a portfolio in case he ever needs it. Glad Jose took the time out of his day to thoroughly explain the policy to my dad and myself! Unparalleled service!</text>

Today April 29th, 2019 was the 1st interaction with Claims Personnel that was to my benefit and I felt someone was finally working with me rather than against me. Pheobe was willing to listen and help me (hopefully) conclude the claims process.  I also spoke with Trini who was able to locate the final documents that were sent from my leinholder to the Portfolio website on April 22, 2019 but had NOT been processed. I was assured (I hope) that the claims checklist is NOW complete and within 10 business days will be finalized!!
Thank you Pheobe & Trini, your customer service IS exceptional. You were the positive that up until today has been an extremely negative experience with GAP Portfolio.

I had gone round and round with the dealership trying to get them to cancel my warranty plan and GAP insurance for a car I no longer had. The dealership made cancelling my warranty and GAP plan a complete nightmare. Needless to say, I lost faith in the dealership after this terrible  experience which is when I reached out to Kaci at Portfolio Co to try get some clarity and make sure my cancellation forms were actually processed. Kaci not only gave me a breakdown of what forms were processed and when, but also processed a GAP cancellation form the dealership forgot to process. The level of customer service and professionalism was so refreshing! Kaci turned this entire experience around for me and really did go the extra mile to meet all my needs. Kaci is definitely an asset to the company.

I would highly recommend the Portfolio Co. to all thinking about buying GAP/Auto Protection Plans.< /text><Name>Martin Flores< /Name><gmapID>0x80dce9d156a26883:0x29c8f59112da6c93<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I have Key and Road Hazard coverage on my 2018 Kia Sorento, as part of my extended warranty. Last month I had a blowout after running over some object in the road.

After replacing the tire, I called Portfolio to submit my claim. I was able to speak with a live person - based in the US - very quickly when I called in. Austin, the rep I spoke with, answered my questions and emailed me the form I needed to submit while we were on the phone.

After submitting the form, I received my approval within hours. I was also given a timeframe for receiving payment both over the phone and again via email.

I have used gap once prior to Express and it was a breeze. They collected all the documents and just had me sign and poof the claim was done. Yet express is having me do "their" job, my Lien hold and dealer who sold me this policy agree as well.<//review>

But when the shower curtain is pink at the bottom, it needs to be replaced and cleaned for bacteria. Room 134.
Changes to the room should be mentioned on your website; "we have taken the coffee maker and hair dryer out of the room due to Covid".< /review><userid>100186601939511683944<//userid><rate>3</rate><username>Costa Elfy< /username>< Gmap_id>

That certainly is disconcerting.  I have asked our Housekeeping team to replace it as soon as the next guest has departed, if it hasn't already been done.  I am happy to report that we are getting ready to return the coffee maker, hair dryer, alarm clocks back in the rooms. I only hope that this doesn't discourage you from visiting Sequoia National Park in the future.\n\nKind regards,\nBrett Archer\nGeneral Manager"}< /response></record>

Great place to stay near the General Sherman tree. Check in was easy and our room was clean. I'd give this a 5/5, but the lodge restaurant hours I wish were posted on our reservation itinerary prior to arrival. We were disappointed after watching the sunset at Moro rock to find that our only option for food was their mac n cheese and left over salads since the restaurant was closed. I believe it closed at either 7 or 8pm. Just an important thing to remember if you stay here!!<//text>

The room was comfortable enough and was well fitted for the getaway we were on. Cable TV and Wifi were provided, though don't expect to be able to stream movies at night with 1.5mbps download speeds.

The lodge is located only a couple miles from the Sherman Tree and Beetle rock, as well as the Sequoia Museum. The road from the southwest gate to the lodge is a fantastic journey of hairpin turns, incredible views from a height, and breathtaking cliffs without a guardrail for an hour. Fill up your tank before making the drive up!

The food is OK but nothing to write home about at the lodge, in fact, I would recommend to bring some snacks as everything is pricey. Which is to be somewhat expected being in the middle of the park.

The Arts & Crafts/Mission style of the lodge and cabins were very pleasing. Overall I had a very pleasant experience!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The area is beautiful. Unfortunately the lady at the desk was rude and seemed annoyed.  It was our first visit and we had a few questions that she answered with an attitude, really made us feel like we were bothering her.  . Not at all what I was expecting from this lodge.  We had planned a second trip for later this year with more family members but we decided against that after the treatment we received.</review>< Pics>

Probably worse, but I walked out immediately. Brian at the front desk apologize and issued me another room. When I arrived there was someone already their doing a quality check. I would have left had it not been 11:30pm and my kids being tired.

DON’T RESERVE A ROOM!!!!

Yes the nightly rate is a bit high for the room/amenities you get but it's all about the location. Check in is in different location then rooms. Yes parking is away from rooms but it's not that far. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was comfortable. They welcome dogs too. Our room didn't have AC, even though it gets cool outside at night it's still warm inside. Ceiling fan helped. Very quiet at night.

First time to Sequoia Nat'l Park and it's beyond beautiful up here. Wuksachi Lodge is right at the center of all the main attractions and trails so definitely 5 stars for location. There is a lot of signage so it was easy to find. Because the Lodge is in the middle of the forest you see a ton of wildlife without even trying which is fantastic. The only down side is that it's the only place with a restaurant in all of Sequoia Nat'l Forest I believe so you have to eat at the Waksuchi Lodge restaurant. The food is pricey but really good. I was pleasantly surprised at the options, portion size and quality of the meals. There's a mini fridge in the room so definitely bring your own drinks and snacks. You can find other food options at the town at the base of the mountain called Three Rivers but it's about an hour drive from Waksuchi through winding mountain roads so a pain to go just for lunch or dinner.  The staff is super friendly and welcoming and really love the diversity of guests staying here. We stayed in a two queen room and it's very spacious with a small table with 3 chairs, closet, bench by the door to take dirty boots/clothes off, and average size bathroom.<//Text>

We stayed in king room with Mountain View  and the room was very clean. We had an issue with the door lock to our room. We had just settled into our room when suddenly the door opened up and a women walked into our room and announced it was her room!  It was a bit disconcerting that she could open our door. Long story she was mixed up and she and her husband were staying in another room. We called the front desk and they sent out an engineer to fix our door lock which they did. The room was big and basic. Nothing fancy but perfectly fine for one night and given the setting in the forest it was magical. The staff could not have been nicer. Ordered pizza from the outdoor terrace and took back to our room as it was 35 degrees outside. Sequoia is a fantastic place to visit and if you want to be inside the park this is the place to be.<//Review><Name>Hotels.com reviewer<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Brett completely turned this trip around for my fiance and me! Our last three days had been nothing but a disaster traveling through out California and the closures throughout Sequoia due to snow looked like a continuation of the rest of our trip. The final. The final nail in the coffin was when every location was closed that could supply us with snow shoes for our back country hikes throughout the park, or at least that would have been the case if not for Brett. Brett went out of his way to leave the lodge and find us some snow shoes down at lodgepole market, which is 2 miles away on roads that require snow chains to even access them. This is the best customer service imaginable and an unheard of case of going above and beyond for a customer at your lodge.  We highly recommend you stay at the lodge and if your stay isn't absolutely perfect, you now know the man that can make is happen.<//Text>

It's okay. Rooms are not in the same building as I was checking in. They are at the Sequoia building, a minute drive.Some walk and stairs(about 2-3minutes) from the parking lot to my  room which was located on the second floor. No elevator. My room was spacious and clean. There's a fridge. Because of Covid, no coffee machine, no hair dryer, no microwave in the room, but you can request some items at the main office. My room was next to the vending machine. TV is small compare to the one at John Muir Lodge. Free Wi-Fi. Complimentary coffee in the morning. My room rate was at $242 net.<//Text>

<Rate>None< /Rate><Text>Terrific stay at the Wuksachi. Everyone working there was wearing masks, plastic guards in place etc. Felt very safe considering the pandemic. John and Haley at the front desk were really wonderful, great sense of humor and very accommodating. We had book three separate room types across a few different platforms and were supposed to move every night. John and Haley worked hard to "merge" our reservations, ensuring we could stay in the same room for our entire stay. Food at the lodge was actually the best in the park IMO. Would 100% recommend staying here if you are visiting Sequoia Kings Canyon. It is also located very close to popular sights (Moro Rock, Crescent Meadow, General Sherman) and rooms are updated and comfortable.</Text>< Pics>

After arriving and during the checkin for our stay. Emily,  at the desk, informs us that for our safety during covid, they have removed coffee maker's from all rooms. To get coffee,  you walk from the motel rooms to parking lot, drive to parking lot for the Lodge and then walk into the lodge. When we got to our room we learned they had also removed hair dryers and alarm clocks, for our safety! We were never informed these included amenities would be excluded from our room.< /text>

I am sorry that we let you down.\n\nI am hoping that you will reach out to me at barcher@delawarenorth.com; I would like to resolve this for you.  I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards,\nBrett Archer\nGeneral Manager'}< /Response>

<Review>Room and location are great!!!!!!! Bring your own cold food (no microwaves) to put in the mini fridge or cooler if you bring one because the food SUCKS and is over priced. The location is amazing though and we WILL stay here again. John at the front desk is the nicest man ever!!!!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Location was amazing.  Rooms are comfortable.  My issues that lowered my rating were check in with only one agent at the desk and the line out the door and the poor lighting in the parking lot and up to the buildings.  It was very difficult to find our building then to have to use a luggage cart on a poorly paved  walkway with no lights was very hard.  Come on.  I was with my partner and her parents.< /Review>

We recently spent two nights at the Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia National Park. This is the feature park lodge excellently located just a few miles from major sightseeing in the Giant Forest section of the park.

Reservation was made 6 months in advance directly through the park website. Email confirmation was received immediately. 4pm Check-in at the main lodge was very slow, around 30 minutes due to two sets of guest ahead of us in the queue. Hopefully they will learn to check in guests quicker in the future.

Lobby area is nice, includes seating near a stone fireplace. There is a gift shop on site as well as a restaurant called the Peak. We had dinner here one night, it was quite poor (see separate review) so we opted to not eat here the next day.

Rooms are found in 3 separate buildings around 400 metres from the lodge. There is a carpark below. You have take your luggage rather far to get into the building and then up to your rooms. Rooms were decent but not what you'd expect for the room rates normally.

Space was good, furnishing a bit dated and decor common. Bed comfort just ok. Room came with sitting sofa and chair, desk with chair, fridge, flat screen TV and enough closet space for most. Bathroom space was fine, shower water pressure a bit weak but plenty of warm water. We paid higher rate for a room with a view. Our room was a first floor room overlooking the carpark. That felt like a wasted spend.

Overall, you are paying for the location with Wuksachi Lodge. We very much appreciated being so close to the Giant Forest, allowing us to visit early in the morning before too many tourists overwhelmed the trails and sights. It was nice being able to return to the lodge for a bit of a rest before heading back out midday. Otherwise, we felt rather meh about the room considering the high rates and would probably opt to stay elsewhere and just drive in for sightseeing next time.< /text>

So much so we could very readily have stayed longer than the one night we were booked in for.
The food was okay but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was largely perfunctory rather than accomplished but I imagine recruitment must be quite a challenge given the location. We visited in September and got the feeling that many staff are simply getting a bit people-weary.
The location is beautiful and we loved the drive both up and down the mountain.< /text></record>

The rooms are nice, while I was here the TV's did not work, but the staff provided guests access to many board games, and there are many fun activities around the lodge. All the guests were really cheery making it a nice place to stay. If they had room service I would give it 5 stars, but in 15 feet of snow I understand not having it. Overall a good fun experience with my family.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHaxpSXskJ1AnTqYSd5xWDYpyDMyrz6BcE-IPH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKAgyaQOqdkRGeYzOZgI0VdgTS1nEmmveZJE57=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvAT332R5QzV5aT8V6yYEoPm8JLjJscwROK-yK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxVdAlSnvkDSsqVNmDUhATpkAlsUB_KPy6yMdm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF7NCbVqRZp3bUCkXe9qvErI0inglDHKTR3Vul=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5nwcCVvEI75j8Rxu-J4b3rNIBl-w4c9UQTn9G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjV69QBYz-CL7EHyrJfR7vLTjaKVcAu_ECzIUr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ2m8_Dasv4rrnC5sL53tgI2ZkvAN7H79NVYvC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaA1hz0-cQlJ_AtqbE51oO4xqMwTSZsEDlRhOA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
The place is very cozy, but I wish it would be more clean and more “fixed” there was a lot of small things in my room like broken handles and not working closet doors, food in restaurant is VERY good, steak is must to try. Also view was unbelievable from my room, but like I said I wash it would be a bit more maintained</Review>

1:30 am and awake, horrible mattress and unable to control the temperature. Heat just keeps blasting.  Ugh. For $260 + But it is pretty here, recommend camping though< /text>

<review>They are taking advantage of the pandemic and over charging for their food. They know they are the only choice on the mountain.. they closed indoor dining (no trash because other places are open) just so they can have less staff and charge 17.00 for a small plain dry bad pizza. Ohh and you’ll have to wait in a like in the cold for an hour to get the bad food. Staff really doesn’t care about the guests. They are there to be there.. this place could be nice if they took some time to fix their $it.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

The room is away from the main building. It was quiet and nice. But the atmosphere and service of the restaurant were good, but not very good.< /text>

The room was really nice and clean. I thought the view would be from a top floor but it was on the first floor. The dinner was good. The only complaint is that the tub in our room was clogged and the water took forever to go down the drain. Another downfall was That I was told the breakfast would be available from 7-10am I arrived at 9am and it was already closed and we weren’t able to have breakfast.</review>

The rooms are very clean.  The beds and pillows were comfortable.  The location was ideal for visiting Sequoia and King’s Canyon.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  We would definitely recommend this as the place to stay if you are visiting Sequoia National Park overnight.</review>

The location can't be better. The lodge is actually pretty. The room is ok, and generally pretty good. Simple. The thing is the service and the restaurant. The food is absolutely terrible. Not sure I had the bad luck to go when the cook was sick and a random staff took over the kitchen, but the person cooking my food, including the breakfast buffet, couldn't cook at all. Not even a simple pasta. They served an old pasta, which was definitely cooked earlier in the day. We couldn't eat. I saw that the couple next to us also couldn't eat their food and just left the restaurant.<//Review>

<text>This is exactly what I was looking for; a quiet place, adjacent to hiking and beautiful landscapes where I could sit and gather my thoughts. They are doing a great job of keeping everything clean and orderly during covid and the front desk are very helpful in answering where you can go to find the best spots to take some photos.<//text>< pics>

Really cool staying in the park!  Lodge is nice, rooms are rustic and only one dining option (which was average at best). But didn't really matter because of the setting!< /text>

<Review>Combinations are modest but cozy and very woodsy. Surprisingly, the steak at the main restaurant in the lodge was outstanding and I had it on two separate occasions in a five night time frame. I've eaten steak all over North America and this is definitely in my top 10. Would go back there just for that. The staff are kind if not particularly overly helpful but the Lodge and Resort in the park are small enough compared to say Yosemite that one can get around without too much difficulty. Don't miss the Falls. One has to see the General Sherman tree though warning the hike back up the hill is not for the faint of heart at 7000 feet altitude<//Review>< Pictures>

<resp>None</resp><review>Even accounting for COVID-19 this establishment grossly over sells itself.
The rooms have not been updated in many years, carpets are not clean anywhere, and there were knobs missing from the dresser the TV sits on.
A/C consisted of a fan wedged into a window, there is no A/C that we found in our room.
Food choices are limited (COVID), however $17 for a frozen pizza is a stretch, especially when they are burned beyond recognition.  Check the boxes too because not only is there a good chance it's charred, it may not even be pizza.  Don't bother with the Bison burger either, any flavor it was supposed to have is cooked out of it.
We should have just camped.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great place to go up and see snow during the winter months. Tons of hiking trails close to the lodge and several of the largest trees in the world. Make sure to bring chains if there is a chance of snow and take your time going up and down the roads as they can ice up. Highly recommend staying a few nights and bringing up some food to snack on by the outside tables or in the game room. Good place to get away from it all and spend time with family.</Text>< Pics>

We made a reservation at Wuksachi lodge through hotels.com. When we arrived at the lodge, the staff at the front desk said they did not have our reservation from hotels.com and offered us another room at the hotels.com price instead. Since it was pretty late, we agreed to pay again and book directly with the lodge and though we would get the refund from hotels.com after returning back. We could not connect to hotels.com while we were there due to network issues. After returning back home, when I reached out to hotels.com for a refund they declined my refund citing that the lodge told them that we were a no show. This incident happened in February and ever since then I am trying to get my refund either from hotels.com or Wuksachi lodge and both the places do not seem to care. Pathetic customer service.<//text>

{'time': 1594151160062, 'text': "Dear Soumya... We apologize for your experience. I'm sure there is an explanation as Im sure it was an error for us to have marked you as a no show after making another reservation due to the problem with the Hotels.com reservation.Other than this billing issue with Hotels.com, we hope that your stay with us was comfortable and that we were able to give you a sense of safety with our continuous cleaning staff roaming through the lodge and guest room areas. Please contact me directly at 5596257703 so we can get further information as we have no access to 3rd party sites guest contact information."}</Response>

The hotel never bother to call us or write an email saying the hotel was cancelling the reservation and that would not be operating during the weekend we had a reset for! Same for Expedia... also was not even aware the hotel was closed. We found out when we got into to Sequoia Park at the day. So disrespectful !</review>

When we got there.  The front desk told me that they had not received the booking.  Let me pay to stay.  They only have my name.  Actually they received the money.  We arrived very late.  They were just taken for 2-3 hours.  Anxious waiting.  They did not try to contact the company.  It just means that they did not receive the money.  Breakfast was terrible and not cheap.  Just good location.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>Up there on the mountain the air is really thin. So the people working there are a little spacey. When we arrived the room we reserved was not cleaned. It was a little disturbing after lugging the luggage up the steps. We were assigned a different room. It's pretty basic in the rooms, a step up from camping or renting a cabin. The WiFi only worked half the time and when it did it was very slow. The best part about the place is its food. The breakfast and the dinner were top notch and didn't disappoint. Trails immediately around the lodge aren't the best in the forest. Drive a bit south to get low enough where the Sequoia grow giant.< /text>< Name>

The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5... the rooms had no microwave which seams crazy to me since they have a fridge so all the food I brought for our kids was useless and second I really feel the rooms should have a shovel to shovel your car out. If someone takes it then charge the room but they do have them in the “store” for $20... just another way to make money off of guests. The room was clean. Shower sucked but it’s an old hotel so I wasn’t surprised. Bring something to do!!! The tv didn’t work and the WiFi is minimal. I did no research before our trip and wished I had so I would of brought a book.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

I found myself in this hotel only because my car broke in the woods. But despite of the stress I enjoyed my stay because this is a beautiful place, very comfortable and pretty rooms and extremely friendly and helpful staff. I still curse myself I didn't ask the names of the guys at the reception who shared their cable and cigarette when i needed it the most. Thank you!!!< /Review>

You pay for the location, rooms were dated and had to get a change of sheets because hair and dirt in bed.   Light switches were dirty.    View was amazing and you are close to many trails.</Text>

<Review>The rooms were very clean, well maintained and ready to give you a relaxing experience.
Their restaurant however has very few offerings and I would strongly suggest you finish your meals someplace outside the park if possible. The meals are definitely not worth the money at wuksachi lodge.< /Review></record>

< review>
Loved our New Years stay here & would definitely stay here again! The restaurant is excellent & reasonably priced. Beautiful views from the dining room. The hotel staff was very friendly & helpful. The room was very comfortable & nice. Not super luxurious but it’s 7500 up in a National Park. The only complaint is that I upgraded at the last minute to a Deluxe ‘View’ room & there was a tree in front of the window so I couldn’t really see the mountains. It was a nice view but I expected a better view for the $25 upgrade. The rooms accommodate a family of 5 which is great. Can’t wait to come back!<//review>

The Lodge is great. Perfect way to spend the trip to the giant forest. The only negative is the restaurant. The service was slow and food was not prepared well. Otherwise the Logde was great.</text>

Didn't stay but ate in the restaurant. Food was great. Price perfect for lunch. Burgers were tasty and fries were out of this world! Lots of items on menu, we just stopped in for lunch so that's what we had. Service was great. Dont be scared by the high end looks of the place price was not over priced. Its view were stunning. Thank you for a great short visit! I would definitely stay here next time in the park.</review>

Large clean rooms near the lodge. WIFI and TV reception was poor, but we were not here for that. Hot breakfast is served for $14.00 at the lodge. The location is about in the middle of Sequoia National Park which makes it convenient to the sites.<//text>

Wintertime visit - Upon arrival already tired from the long day of hiking didn’t realize the rooms were separate from the rest of the lodge. Lodge had a nice cozy fireplace with great Christmas decorations! Bar had great wings and draft beer! Definitely check the bar out. Excluding the bartender the customer service wasn’t the greatest, the wait staff seemed unorganized and all over the place. The rooms are divided into 3 different buildings, parking is pretty far from the actual entrance, you rely on a baggage cart to haul your items to your room. The path to the rooms were icy and snowy, not well cleared off. Not to mention the buildings with rooms had 3 floors with no elevators so that’s inconvenient. The room didn’t have a microwave which made things difficult for people who food prep vs expensive restaurant. It wasn’t worth the $225 we paid. BUT it wasn’t a bad stay - ended up having a very relaxing night in a beautiful area! This lodge is very convenient as far as location!</Text>

This place is nothing short of amazing. The location is out of the way, but that adds to the adventure and experience. We enjoyed all the trails of Sequoia for 4 days. The entire staff was very friendly. And the bar and The Peaks was fantastic food. If you want the best Old Fashioned, ask Cassidy to make it with Rye and lemon peel.</text>

The Wuksachi lodge is a timeless classic and a true retreat into one of the most beautiful national parks in the state of California. The renovations made for a superb room and the staff all seemed to be quite cheerful. The predictable downsides are the relative high price of the room and restaurant, but it’s worth it. I hope to return one day!<//text>

Such a peaceful place to stay. It definitely has a very happy feel! The room that my boyfriend and I stayed seemed up to date/nicely renovated, yet it still kept it's lodge/outdoorsy feel. Our room also had a balcony attached. The dining room in the main Lodge has plenty of delicious food options, and there is a buffet style breakfast in the mornings. I highly recommend this lodge!< /Text>

<Review>We visited the Lodge itself, so I can't attest to the accommodations. The lodge is a classic chalet-style with large beams and high ceilings. Kind of a weird layout with the dining tables the way they were in parallel rows. It felt kind of.. "Institutional" in the dining commons. The food was "meh". The Porter on tap made up for that, and was GOOD. But hey, it's warm inside and the view of the trees is awesome. One critical point for me was the fireplace in the lobby- Euro tourists sitting, laying, and crowding the small amount of space there was, and not sharing the fire when we walked in. They were even more overbearing when we tried to occupy the space after we ate. They just kept hogging the bandwidth and sitting with their feet up on the furniture. I'd go back-<//Review></record>

<Review>One of my favorite places in the world! The beauty of the park is other worldly and although a bit pricey it is so nice to have basic, clean amenities after a long day playing in the giant forest and mountains. Stop in for hot cocoa and fireside relaxing in the lobby before your dinner reservation. 😍</Review><Name>Victoria Neill< /Name>< Resp>

Staff is very helpful and friendly, pricing is fair in my opinion, especially the restaurant, where we expected the food to be expensive, was very decent.

I don't know what some people are expecting when they come to a Lodge in the mountains, but the rooms were nice, well equipped, showers were working fine, everything essential was there and working, that's all you should be worried about.

It actually snowed overnight, and we didn't have any chains in our rental car, which we had to buy at the lodge. They offered us help with the fitting process, so a guy came and did that for us too. Fantastic people, fantastic service, fantastic place.< /text><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

<Review>The best accommodation in California! We have been travelling throughout CA and stayed in multiple hotels and Wuksachi Lodge is by far the best place we have stayed on our journey! Please do not be put off by the Government Shutdown, the Sequoa Park is still open. From the moment we walked through the lobby, a woody scent filled the air followed by the warmest of welcome from the chap on the reception desk. Following check in we passed the log fire burning in the lobby to the restaurant for lunch. Home made sweet potato and curry soup, views of the beautiful trees covered in snow out the window and a hot chocolate, bliss. As for our room, the bed was so comfortable, incredible view, warm, very clean and the soaps in the bathroom are of high quality. Highly recommended this gem of a place! Breakfast, lunch and dinner has also been the best selection of food we have had on our trip!! Hats off to the chef and all the friendly staff, you are doing an incredible job!!< /Review>< user_name>

<rating>5<//rating><review>A wonderful place to stay while visiting Sequoia National Park and seeing the Trees, doings some hikes, and visiting Kings canyon. My wife and I stayed here for 3-4 nights and I will not complain. We came May 7th, 2019 - May 10th, 2019

This place has the antique feel of an original lodge built in the mountains and is ran professionally.

The staff is friendly, the beds are comfortable from the sheets and pillows down to the softness/hardness of the mattress was to our liking. We felt like a king and queen sleeping on it and had good nights sleep every night. You may want earplugs when you sleep as people can be heard in the hallways if they're walking by and talking or closing doors somewhat loudly.

We didn't eat lunch there but had the all you can eat breakfast every morning and had dinner there 3 nights in a row.

The breakfast is decent for the price and the dinner is high quality but you will pay the price for it. Servers were excellent and friendly.
Breakfast is around $15-$20 per person and dinner is around $35-$50 if you are drinking alcohol.

They have a gift shop with everything you may need in case you forget something like snacks or chap stick etc.

Their dining room is open and makes you feel grand.

It's a good place that you should stay at if you want to remember yourself having a great time. Visit this place if you can or skip the hotel and just check out the trees.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

It's in an awesome setting surrounded by trees and with great mountain views, especially on the outside deck. The meal was disappointing - just kind of average, nothing special with the menu options or flavors. Wish we would've just opted to enjoy the view from the deck with a drink and a snack rather than settling in for a proper meal.< /Text>< pics>

<review>The hotel aesthetic is nice. The staff is friendly. They have a nice souvenir shop in the lobby as well as a warm fire. The rooms are a drive or walk from the lobby and the sign that tells you is not nearly big enough. (dont take your luggage to check in) The rooms do not have a microwave, the shower gives you half the normal amount of water so chances are you won't be able to enjoy a nice, warm shower. The rooms also do not have AC, ONLY heat. The sink water was also VERY cloudy and lastly, their wifi is terrible. You won't get any cell service. They definitely have some work to do.< /review><Name>lucena17</Name>< UserId.>

<text>We had such a great stay! Everyone at Wuksachi Lodge was super friendly and helpful, the food was good, the speciality drinks just awesome. The room was very clean, the beds cozy and comfortable, the scenery in the window picture perfect. On one of our hikes we met a very kind soul who works there, and she was so awesome as to walk us to see a great local spot, just to show it to us and make sure we would not lose our way. Thank you, and thank everyone at the Lodge for the great service. Needless to say that the Giant Forest, the General Sherman, The Congress trail and the Moro Rock will remain as unbelievably wonderful memories that we now share as family.< /text>< userid>

<Review>Staying in the park was definitely worth it. We did the bead and breakfast package. Waking up early to tour the park made it easy to get around in the morning. Breakfast buffet in the morning was very good. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, potatoes and cereal and fruit. Dinner at the lodge was expensive but very tasty. The rooms were dated as we expected having stayed in parks before. They were clean, well appointed and comfortable. Highly recommend this park and lodge.<//Review>< rate>

<Text>Wow!  We have never been treated so well.  We stayed for 3 nights and got the AAA discount and I guess we looked nice and had our room upgraded too. The rooms are away from reception in separate buildings but they provide any help you need. Our room had a view and everything was very clean.  King bed was memory foam and fine if you like them.  Food was served at the restaurant and prices are high but not what they could be since they are the only place in the park to eat in winter (February) and the food was excellent. Breakfast was buffet and you could choose two options cereal and sweet rolls at $7.50 or the whole shebang for $12.50.  Dinner had a complete menu from $12.00 - $34.00 and deserts were too good.  Creme  brûlée cheesecake and chocolate mousse were hits.  Wait staff were excellent and so helpful. Kim was exceptional in taking care of us. We will be coming back.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>It was a very pleasant and down to earth place to spend a few days away from the hustle and bustle.  Many, many tourists but for the most part everybody was kind, patient, not so much in a surry, and respected the environment around us.  I left the area much calmer and very proud to be an American.< /Text><name>Orbitz reviewer< /name>< Pictures>

I had high hopes of what our time would be at the Wuksachi lodge. It was an experience that we splurged on and thought that it would enhance our enjoyment of Sequoia National Park. It was actually quite the opposite. The room was over 80 degrees when we arrived. The maintenance man came out after two calls about it. He turned off the wall units, but this still did not cool our "Superior" room below 75º F even with the windows open. I have never seen a baby pack-n-play as cheap as the one that was given for my daughter to sleep in. You could literally feel the bars through the mattress in it.

The Peak restaurant was the single largest disappointment. It is everything you would expect from a vendor that has a monopoly. The food was of terrible quality for the prices. The burger I ordered the first night was not cooked to temperature. The restaurant was out of milk at breakfast the first morning, meaning we could not give my one year old daughter milk. The kid's spaghetti that my kids ordered the second night made them both sick. The last morning we were there, they were literally running out of everything to the point where you had to ask the wait staff for each item. The only server that was helpful was Trevor.

I would not recommend the Wuksachi Lodge or the Peak Restaurant to anyone. You would be better off staying and eating outside of the park.

The Lodge sent me a survey after our trip which I gave them the same feedback as posted above and asked to be contacted. 6 weeks have passed and I still have not received a call.<//Text>

< Review>
The Wuksachi Lodge had a delicious restaurant inside, a small gift shop, and a comfortable seating area. The rooms are a short drive away, and boy are they pretty. The beds are comfy, the bathroom is clean, and you don't feel like you're on top of each other. But the views are really what elevate these rooms. I can't imagine there is a room in that lodge with a bad view. We were surrounded by trees, and you just felt so in touch with the park, despite being in a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was a buffet, and while it wasn't cheep, it was delicious! I ate so much it was crazy. I could write a whole separate post on the parks themselves. They are some of my favorite places in the world. So many different features all in one place, it's incredible. Plus the lodge offers a free shuttle all through these wonderful works of nature. This is a wonderful experience. You must must MUST book your room well in advance, sometimes a year out. But I promise it's worth it.<//Review>

<text>Stayed at the lodge in a mountain view king suite in the Sequoia building. The bed was well "grooved" leaving a huge ridge in the middle and made me feel like I was falling off the side.  3 of the 4 window coverings were broken.  The views, however, were spectacular and the restaurant was good but pricey for park food. Wifi was overtaxed the entire time and I even had issues getting Google Maps to load directions because the connection was so poor.</text>< rating>

This is a great lodge that will give you the feeling you want out of a Woodsy California Adventure. We recently went to North Tahoe looking for this type of experience and were greatly disappointed. But, coming here, having the constellation night time thing, easy access to everything around here and the good restaurant located inside the lodge, it's everything you could ask for. Great experience.</text>

<Review>You couldnt ask for a better location in Sequoia than Wuksachi Lodge. Located 2 miles from Lodgepole (which is where they have a marketplace, grill, and the shuttle for the other Sequoia attractions), Wuksachi is right where you want to be located in the park. The lodge itself and the room was clean, but unfortunately when we were there in July 2018, they were under construction on the grounds, both in front of the lodge and next to the dining room. This really takes away from the experience, and I was surprised they were doing the work during peak season? The lodge itself has very little when it comes to amenities. There is a restaurant on site that actually had great food at a mid-level price. The downside is you need to book reservations for dinner, so unless you get them in early, you will find yourself eating at either 5:00 or 8:00. There is not much else to do at the lodge. No pool or game room or anything like that. That may not be an issue for most since the main reason to visit Sequoia is to be in the park, but for people who like to break up their adventures with a day at the resort, there is nothing to do at this one. They did have a nice stargazing retreat at night which was provided free of cost, and that was a lot of fun. In terms of the rooms, be aware that they do not have A/C, just window and ceiling fans. Since it was Summer when we were at the lodge, it was pretty warm during the day and the room was stuffy. Thankfully it cooled down enough at night.<//Review>< pics>

Mostly better than average national park lodging. But, having to carry all personal items including coolers (because of bears) was a real bummer because rooms are far from parking lots and up on the hill.

Also, lack of an AC unit was harder to deal with than I thought. Even after opening all windows and turning on all the fans at max speed for 2+ hours before sleep, I had some trouble getting asleep because the room was too hot.

All the staffs I interacted with were very friendly and professional.<//text>

This is a very decent lodge.  It's not gigantic, it's not part of a village, and there is no night (or day-life) here.  It is very quiet, very clean and well kept with a well placed restaurant.  All in all, very peaceful and just minutes away (driving) from the General Sherman and the well-stocked (Food, wine, spirits and lots of souvenirs) convenient store. I will never forget this place.</review>

<Text>An amazing hideaway tucked deep into the mountains of Sequoia National Park. The lodge is rustic, cozy, and and excellent place to relax after a long day of hiking and exploring. The rooms aren't luxury, however they are nice enough to get the job done and keep heat inside. I would give 5 stars for the location, scenery, and service. However, I have to give 4 stars because there is only one dining option on site which is quite expensive. I would definitely return again and recommend this place to anyone visiting Sequoia National Park.<//Text><name>Evan W</name><response>{'time': 1506715942098, 'text': 'Thank you for your review.'}< /response><rate>4</rate></record>

I reserved this hotel back in September to spend Thanksgiving. I did it online with 3 months in advance and the payment went through. One week before my trip they left a message saying there were no rooms and I was moved to a days inn hotel. I never received the message. They day of my check in, I called to cancel
the reservation since a winter storm was coming and we're not going to make it. Then they told me I didn't have the room anyway. Horrible costumer service. I only imagine driving there through the storm and no having a room. I only advice if you're going to book, call them and be sure you got a room before driving there.< /text>

<text>Great staff with the exception of the restaurant. For the price of the food it was under cooked, some of it actually still frozen. Flat soda and they didn't get me another soda until after I had already finished all the food. The meat was pretty much raw and full of oil.

We stayed one night. The main Lodge is nice, with a warm fire and nice restaurant. It's fairly new and is very "mountain lodge" in decor - rustic and comfortable. The actual rooms are in three separate buildings. The location of the rooms could be a problem for people with disabilities ( not a problem for us) but if I had trouble with a lot of walking and some uphill walkways, it wouldn't be good. The rooms were clean, no wifi in rooms, but you could get it in the main Lodge building. The location is in one of the most beautiful places on the earth, so that is biggest plus, in my opinion. Meals were not included, so consider that when booking. The only place to eat ( breakfast, lunch or dinner) is at the restaurant in main Lodge building. Full breakfast was around $14, continental was $8. We had dinner in restaurant. The food was very good at average-high price. It has to be trucked in over hairy mountain roads, so I'm sure that is reason for prices.<//Review>

Great place to stay! Nice clean rooms. Nothing fancy. Don't expect to have cell reception and the wifi is pretty darn slow but free and serviceable. The lodge is very close to some of the Park's best offerings! You'll find General Sherman, The Giant Tree Museum, and many hiking trails very close by.< /Review>

I give Wuksachi Lodge a 5 star because of the amazing service and kindness of the workers.

--So I brought my brand new Canon Rebel t5i to take photos and videos on in Sequoia National Park because it is spectacularly beautiful! But, this was a very brand new Camera, like I got it only a week ago and I bought it from my uncle and he gave me some other cool gear with it too, including a charger. Unfortunately, it was the wrong charger for my camera. So toward the end of the first day our of three day trip, I was devastated because my camera was on low battery and I was going to not be able to film and photograph the rest of the trip. HOWEVER, I asked the workers at the front desk if any of them had a spare charger and they thought of all their coworkers who had cameras. Eventually, one of the coworkers had the exact same camera and the right charger and she let me use hers. Her name was Victoria Dunbar and she even insisted on letting me bring HER charger back to my room to charge my camera for the duration of my stay!

The views from where we stayed are also incredible and the bedroom was very big and spacious. The cots they have are also the best cots I have ever slept on!

By and large, fabulously friendly staff.</Review>

<user_name>Mike Simpson< /user_name><Review>Had a wonderful time staying at the Wuksachi Lodge. The location is excellent, only a couple of miles away from the best attractions of the Sequoia National Park. We visited the peak restaurant for 2 dinners and breakfast. Other than the steak knives being dull, the food was great and their drinks were refreshing. They had good prices and selection for being such an isolated restaurant. We also ordered the box lunches since we were going hiking all day, and they were very satisfying. The lodge is where you check in and the location of the restaurant and gift shop, and the rooms are in their own separate buildings detached from the lodge. There is a path that travels between the two that is about a 5 minute walk.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< date>

Wuksachi is located at the top of Sequoia NP, close to the sequoia groves an King's Canyon NP. It is a unique setup, the main common area of front desk and restaurant is separate (a short 5 minute walk) from all the rooms. The restaurant, gift shop, heated deck, and front desk have a mountain Lodge setting and mountain view. The room accommodation portion of Wuksachi is more of a very basic hotel. The room provides basic beds, a small fridge, small TV, and and attached bathroom. While it meets all needs, I believe the rooms were overpriced and the room buildings require some renovations. Do not expect anything like a Lodge.<//text>

Have had lunch here on all my visits to the park, and this time I believe they had redone their menu a bit. Had the club sandwich and it featured this amazing cheese that really brought out the sandwich. Waiter was very nice and sparked a conversation to get to know us a bit. All the food looked good.

We went up for a few days and had a nice stay in the snow. The hotel was well staffed although they all insist on calling you Mr and Mrs, which I found a bit too formal for my liking. The restaurant had quite a selection for being in such a remote area and the bartender was fun to talk to. The drinks they made really fit the weather. Speaking of which, if you intend to go up during snow season, be sure you buy snow chains and learn how to put them on BEFORE you make the drive. Many people got into minor accidents or had no idea how to put on chains when they needed to. Lucky many of the people there will help you out, if you don't run into anyone and you can't put on your chains, you might be stuck for several hours like some of the folks I met.</text>

Wuksachi Lodge will over book!  How do I know, we booked, gave the credit card, got the confirmation and started on the way up the hill. This was a direct reservation no 3rd party was used. When we talked with them they stated they don't use any 3rd party sites.  Note this place is in the park so you must pay a fee to get to it. What made me more fired up was the screen I could see they had over booked people the next two days, too. They had no place for us to go except to spend an hour and half going back down to three rivers out of the park.  Book at your own risk! It's my understanding this is owned by the Delaware North Company (DNC) who also has the market next door while trying to find if a camping option could work. One star is as low as it will let me go but it should have no stars. If you had the same issue please let people know, it's a long way to go without another option. #WillOverBook #Hotel #WuksachiLodge< /Review>

I'm writing this primarily to tie-up a many-month feedback lapse: One of the lodge employees, with a name-tag denoting Josil, very kindly provided my wife and I a set of lengthy explanations to a long list of inquiries. A lot of detail garnered from her personal experiences helped us significantly. This was while we were staying at the lodge where where she worked as a receptionist, not the restaurant-portion.

However, in coming here I've seen a perplexing mix of restaurant reviews. There must be some variability in chefs! To provide our tip on that balance - the restaurant was fantastic. The portions were large - much larger than expected! Very pleasing when you've been traipsing about the Sequoias all day. (Also worth noting - they provided gluten-free options, a must for my wife.)  The workload on the wait-staff was quite high, but provided great service despite this. Equally important, the ambiance of the place was lovely and perfectly suited the external environs/views thereof. A high-ceiling open space, stone slab and timber construction, centered on a large, radiant fireplace.<//text>

That is a significant investment and faces many regulatory challenges, so that will take some time, of course.\n\nWe are already making significant investments in the Grant Grove area (building a new check-in area and next year a completely new restaurant building) and are looking into what we need to do in the Wuksachi area to handle the growing number of guests.\n\nApologies that it took so long to reply, but we do very much appreciate your comments!"}</resp><gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019</gmap_id></record>

They offered us a great stay experience! Great food, reasonably priced, and a good location. It would have been five stars, if not for the completely nonexistant Wi-Fi. Their ad says that the Wi-Fi is slow in the rooms, but faster in the lodge/restaurant area, but in reality, there is ABSOLUTELY NO Wi-Fi anywhere on the premises. You cannot send a simple text to your loved ones to reassure them that you are still alive, and having a good time. This is important, as there is no cell service for several miles. Other than this, great service, food, rooms, and people<//Review>

<review>It's a nice place. It's definitely in the mountains, after a lot of winding road. Make sure you have plenty of gas. We thought we did. But not even half way up, we decided to turn around because it's so winding and steep, it was not helping conserve our gas. The rooms are nice though. Not strong wifi considering the location and amount of people trying to use it. But not a bad thing. Also, dinner requires reservations so if you missed that, as I did, reserve for your first night and whenever else you want to eat. You're probably not gonna want to drive an hour+ to try going back into town to eat. And then an hour to get back up. Nice place though.</review></record>

<review>A charming lodge in the beautiful Sequoia NP. Beds were a bit on the firm side and could use more pillows. Staff was friendly and helpful in navigating us to areas of the park. Nothing beats stepping out of your hotel room to a gorgeous mountain view.

Some things to note:
- The path from the check in area to the three lodges isn't particularly well lit. Make sure to bring a flashlight when walking about at night.
- When you access the Sequoia set of rooms, there are a set of shallow, uneven stairs with no handrail. However, there is a ramp which makes for a much smoother walk.
- The front desk fails to mention this, but it is on the check in materials that a bellhop can bring your luggage to your room. You can also get a luggage cart in your lodge "house" and wheel it down to the car.
- There is no pool. Believe it or not, someone asked the bartender if there was a pool. No, but there are streams and lakes.
- Be prepared to disconnect from your cellphone. Wifi is often spotty and cellular service is practically nonexistent.

Meals are not included with the room rate. The buffet breakfast that is in the restaurant adjoining the check-in area of the lodge is average and I don't feel it is worth the $16-20 unless you eat more than one plate of food. (The prices for the buffet vary based on whether you get the cold or hot breakfast, and the price seems to vary based on whether it is the week or weekend, and the time of year you visit.) It is a typical "American" breakfast of potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, pancakes, pastries, toast, bagels, cereal, some fruit, and oatmeal. There isn't anything special about the breakfast. The pizza from the restaurant, however, is delicious. So are most of the dishes served for lunch and dinner.<//review>< UserId.>

The service at the restaurant is slow and disorganized. Be prepared to wait an hour even for a simple sandwich! However, the atmosphere is amazing, with gorgeous views of the mountains, so the wait can be bearable with good company, an appetizer and some drinks.

The food is fresh and relatively healthy for a restaurant, with vegan and vegetarian options available. While the food isn't amazing on its own, for the elevation at 2000m+ (7000ft+) above sea level, the quality is amazing.<//text>

Great location, clean rooms, friendly front desk staff. Rooms very basic and seem dated despite relatively recent construction. Dining room open for 3 meals, reservations required for dinner, food pretty good. Light on amenities, though 1-2 daily programs led by staff or nearby at Lodgepole Visitor Center.<//Review>

<Review>Staying inside the park was perfect. But overall the lodgings are not great value for money.Staff in the lodge reception were a bit clueless. We asked for some basic advice about where to park for seeing some highlights in the park and the need for snow chains and reception staff didn’t seem to know much.The lodging is in a separate building which is fine. A bit like a motel in the middle of the woods. Plenty of parking. Half of the rooms are on the 2nd floor with no elevator. We were lucky to get a 1st floor room so we didn’t have to carry luggage up. Plenty warm enough even in snowy, cold conditions and clean enough.Your only food option is the restaurant in the lodge which gets booked up so make sure to reserve when you arrive. The restaurant is ok but not amazing.< /Review>< Pictures>

We came in early April and the place was still mostly snowed in. The lodge and the rooms are a couple of hundred meters apart. The rooms themselves are the standard hotel fair, but take heed that there are no elevators, so if you are on the second or third floor you will have to carry your luggage (if you have any) up the long walkway from the car parking to the building and then up the stairs.
In the end, the place is amazing since it is in an amazing place.< /review>

Location is extremely far away from the south end of the park entrance. But the cabin is warm, serves delicious food, has great local craft beer, and even offers coffee and donuts for free downstairs.

Favorite part: they sell little Sequoia seedlings to grow your own!<//review>

I was upset because we arrived at 225 and the hostess would not seat us and seemed annoyed that we even asked. I normally love the lodge's food and that's why I gave it a 4, but the service just wasn't there this time. Still a great place to visit and eat at though!</review>< pictures>

Beautiful lodge designed with a very nice restaurant inside. It has a nice cozy feeling because of the lights, the sofa seats, complimentary coffee and hot water, and a nice fireplace. The lodge is also open 24/7 and serves as a nice information center for visitors as well.<//Review>

<text>We stayed here for one night on the weekend in mid December. The Superior room was large and clean. If you bring children, definitely book this room. The atmosphere was spectacular! The short walk to the main lodge for dinner was great! We had an amazing dinner and the service was excellent (except the bar tender was quite slow). There was few feet of snow in the surrounding area but the walkways were shoveled and clear. I recommend you bring a good flashlight if you plan on walking out of your room after dark, the hotel does provide one but it isn't that great. Overall, I highly recommend this Lodge to stay!< /text>< Pictures>

Lodging staff was nice but seemed to be either misinformed or uniformed about most topics we asked about. The hotel part was clean, cool, and quiet. The restaurant was mediocre at best. The food was inconsistent, one night food was great, next night food was bad enough I'll never eat there again.</Review>

<Text>This place stick in 20th century. Luckily it is moving towards present...slowly but moving. Service is average but it is another captive audience place without competition near by. Perfect location for hikes tho. As long you remain open minded it is ok.< /Text><Time>1536784143300< /Time></record>

A great place for a family vacation. The food and service is good. The surrounding area is beautiful. There is no phone service or reliable WIFI, so be sure to bring activities for the kids just in case you get snowed in.< /Text>

It is a great place to stay inside sequoia park. We stayed in April and was still snowing which was a beautiful experience for me and my family. The food was more than decent at a very affordable price.
We loved this place.<//review>

<text>Beware - the rooms are not all air conditioned - you have to pay for the superior room to get AC - which we would have done if we had known.

Otherwise mostly a nice stay  - the low score is due to a very rude server at dinner on Thursday evening - his behavior was unforgivable so I did not go back to eat there the second night of our stay.  I would likely find another place to stay in the future.< /text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
This lodge is a perfect place to spend a couple nights up in the mountains.  My wife and I booked a two night stay at the lodge following our wedding in Vegas and could not have been more pleased.  The food was amazing and the restaurant provided boxed lunches for traveling around sequoia the next day.  Our waiter Matt, was very helpful in mapping out places to visit around the park and helped make our little honeymoon a very romantic and memorable one.  Our room was extremely nice, clean, and cozy.  I really have nothing but praises for this lodge!< /Review>

<Review>Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms are adequate but thats all. The beds are hard.  The door would not lock from the outside.  The restaurant was very disappointing.  I have been there in previous years and the food has been good, but this time, November 2015, I have to say that the food was very poor indeed.  They kept running out of items, including milk during  breakfast time.  I had two breakfasts, one lunch, and two dinners while there and not one meal was good and it was very pricey.   The lunch sandwich was burnt to a crisp and even the manager agreed it was inedible. i complained and they took the price off my bill.   This is such a shame as it used to be wonderful.  I don't think my husband and myself will be returning.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< name>

We loved our stay, the superior suites were very nice! There were a few surprises, which were inconvenient. I did not realize that the lodge was made up of multiple buildings. It was a bit of a pain to lug all our gear and kids up the snowy paths to the rooms. I knew there would be limited cell reception and internet, however, it was really unnerving to stay in a room where the phone did not work. We came with family and all were in different buildings and our room was the gathering space. We had no way of communicating...except to keep walking back and forth between buildings. The most frustrating things was  that there was no apology or recognition for the inconvenience, just a kind "we'll put in a maintenance request." We were there 2 nights.</Review>

<review>Whenever go to Sequoia National Park I always stop at Wuksachi Lodge for a meal at the restaurant. It is conveniently located just off the main road and just couple of miles from Lodgepole. The food choices and atmosphere are as in a class restaurant, not as the usual fast food choices usually found at remote locations like this. Highly recommend for a quality meal or a romantic dinner by the fireplace.</review>< Name>

Great time just hanging out in the snow. it snowed while we were there which was pretty. This was really just a time to get away from the city with my wife. During the winter there is mostly just cross country snow shoe or ski options but we just hung out at the lodge and played board games.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Arrived on Sunday before Labor Day with my family of 7 expecting no rooms available. To my surprise, they had a standard room and a suite. They were kind to show me both rooms to see which suits better. I ended choosing the suite and they even gave me a break on the price.
The rooms are across the lodge in 3 separate buildings that resemble large cabins. The beds are comfortable and staff was very nice. The views are awesome and the dark sky from the parking lot is breathtaking, would stay there again.</Text>< pics>

Nice place to stay in the middle of the National Park. I snowed during the night we stayed (April 2018) so it gave some more charm to the place overall (plus some work removing the snow for the car ^^). Consider bringing your own food in the park, because as far as I remember, it was expensive there.< /text>

For the location it really can't be beat. A bit pricey, but given where it is it's understandable. The beds aren't the comfiest, and the shower heads are pretty bad. But the staff is amazing, the facilities clean, and overall it was a great experience.< /text>

<Text>What an experience to stay in a National Park. Accommodations are adequate. Price is amazing, we even got a Groupon which gave us free breakfast for 2 for two days. Although the breakfast buffet leaves much to be desired, it was free. Dinner was a bit pricey and the two seafood options (shrimp tacos and rainbow trout) we chose were not worth it. Overall we would stay here again.<//Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The rooms were nicer than expected. The restaurant was hit-or-miss, and one member of our party was locked out of their room for over 2 hours with little assistance from hotel management. We ultimately improvised a way to "pick" the lock on the room ourselves. Didn't leave a great impression. Overall, though, it's a great location for park access if you aren't interested in camping.< /Review>

<text>I loved this place it's like you don't want to go back to reality.  Loved the quietness and their service. Employees at check in and at the lodge were helpful and friendly. They even provide you with toiletries (toothbrush and tooth paste)need to ask though.  The rooms have shampoo and body wash pumps  inside the shower.There is only one place too eat and dinner is expensive but what makes it much more pricey is that you Have Too Pay your waiter a tip and your tab tells you how much YOU HAVE TO PAY that's the only negative thing I can say about this lodge. I believe they should make it into a buffet and that way more people would go up there.  The stay is expensive as it is and you can't drive no where because the road that gets you too the top 8,500 feet has sharp turns and it's dangerous to be driving at night.  By the way the room has no microwave. I went during thanksgiving week 2016. yes we got snow the next day.</text>< GmapID>

Overall I enjoyed my stay. I knew there was snow but i wasnt prepared for 90 inch of it. They did have paths cleared out dso that was good. It got a bit confusing when driving up though. The only reason i gave 4 stars is because there was a good walk from the room to the service desk/restaurant. Also the dinner at the restaurant was pricey and not very good. The breakfast was better. It was basically the only place to eat while out there except going down a ways from the lodge to the store where you can buy packaged sandwiches and microwave food ect. Fyi no microwave in the room just a mini fridge and a coffee pot. I will stay here again but be more prepared with the food part lol.<//text>

<Text>Stayed at this hidden gem 12/12-14.  Its nice to have a decent place to stay at within a national park.  HOWEVER, they decided to perform some upkeeps to the lodges; although it makes complete sense to do this during off peak season, they have failed to 1. have any warnings chemicals will be used; such as paint thinners2. NO ventilation where areas of chemicals are used - windows kept closed in the halls and doors also closed3.  starting the construction at 8:30AM4. Failed to place all guests in 1/3 or 2/3 lodges and work on one lodge at a time5. upon expressing a complaint at check out (after having headaches, nausea, and swollen eyes/face due to the chemicals) everyone whom I talked to from the front desk to the executive chef of the lodge were extremely nice ...EXCEPT the manager.  I left my number and email for the manager to reach me.  I waited long enough in the lobby to have the chance to speak with him, but he was in a meeting.  WHICH WAS FINE, but he should have contacted me.  It has now been over 48 hours since I left the premise and I have yet to hear from management.This is simply a case of gross negligence.  Its a beautiful get-away to enjoy mother nature.  The last thing I had expected was to be sleeping with fumes the whole night that resulted in severe discomfort for me and my pups.  Any time they passed the halls, they sneezed.  I do not wish this kind of experience on anyone, especially at a national park.</Text><Response>None<//Response><user>None</user><Gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019< /Gmap_id>< Pics>

Not friendly for food allergies.
Very busy .. hard to find a person to talk to.

Ordered food with modifications due to food allergies and we specifically asked to speak to chef due to cross contamination issues. Server had no idea about food allergies. After half an hour of wait ,they came and said chef is very busy , he cant come.

I am.ok if restaurants tell that they can't accommodate. But like this after my kid was prepared that he is eating here along with everyone and waited half an hour and then couldn't get any food .</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>I would give 5 star for the beauty of the place and the location. Unfortunately we had to wait so long for our waiter first and food after.. They need a better organization of the restaurant. People look like they did not want to see us. The food was good overall and the waiter turned out to be a nice guy. I was there with my wifey for lunch the day after Thanksgiving. Don't stop for lunch if you want to go around the park, it may take a long time.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>
{'time': 1480618869976, 'text': "Hi Michele,\n\nThanks for the review. I'm sorry that you had to wait so long. We do understand this is a problem and have tried various ways to improve it, but the reality is that we simply need more capacity. To that end, we do have an expansion planned for the restaurant and, beginning next summer there will also be a barbecue on the grounds of Wuksachi Lodge. So we definitely apologize for the wait and do want to let you know that we think we have solutions, but as with any expansion in a national park, the time from planning to implementation can be quite long.\n\nI'm sorry that the wait took away from your time to enjoy the scenery, but glad to hear that you did at least have some time to appreciate the five-star beauty!"}</resp>

<Text>On arrival the parking was farther from the building than we expected, and the walkway was not well lit. The rooms do have wifi, but it's slow. Don't expect it to be reliable when everyone comes back to the hotel at night. The restaurant was ok. We ordered medium burgers that came out well done. On the other hand we ordered a medium rare steak that was perfect. The shower heats up quickly, and water pressure is good. The bedding had some stains.< /Text>< pics>

The park itself is amazing and the restaurant was really great. The lodging was good but not great. It was really hard to juggle temperature and Wi-Fi didn't work. I know this is a lodging in the middle of a national park at almost 7000 feet altitude, but I wanted to point it out< /text>

We recently stay at wuksachi lodge and loved it. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The is just as described on the website. We dined at the  on-site restaurant.  The quality if the foods were above average.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Wuksachi lodge and vilage. I would highly recommend this place as a winter destination.< /Text>

I'm writing this review only on the restaurant, at which my wife and I ate twice during our vacation in Sequoia National Park.

The food was pricey, as I would expect from any restaurant in such a unique location, but I didn't feel it was bad quality. My wife and I both enjoyed what we ordered. I ordered the turkey burger both days, and my wife ordered the prime rib sandwich. I will say that it wasn't any more expensive than the Grant's Grove restaurant, however. If you want to eat "real" food (by that I mean, not junk food) in the Sequoia park, these are your only two options.

I can corroborate a previous statement that we were told dinners were by reservation only; however, we went back to the lodge later to use the facilities, and I asked if they had any dinner openings, and I was told enthusiastically that they did, and from what I could tell, the dinning room was veritably empty.</text>

There was little to no wifi in the rooms, the breakfast buffet lacked good service, the food was DECENT, but not for the price, and the beds had no fitted sheet. This place was way over priced for what they provided. The only plus would be the amazing view and beautiful archetichture of the lodge long building.< /Text>

For starters we waited 5 minutes to be seated for lunch, when the hostess finally took us back the entire dining room was empty. Not sure why the wait. Next the waitress messed up my side and never came back with my fries. She was not friendly until it came time to tip then she was all about asking where we were from. Kind of obvious she could care less. Next went to the gift shop where I waited once again to pay. The girl was more interested in giving directions than ringing up the people waiting in line. Terrible service for what looked like a nice place.<//text>< pics>

Picture-window vistas of the sequoias and a muted Indian theme in the decor, with an unexpected Japanese touch in the interesting earthenware dishes. Menu has that depressingly burger-centric mix familiar from American ski resorts. A Martian would come away innocent of the knowledge that this restaurant is perched above the preeminent fruit-and-vegetable-growing region of North America, such is the generic, corporate feel of the menu.

Service on my visit was slipshod, with a fifteen-minute wait to order. A competent salmon sandwich arrived with fries which a charitable soul would describe as lukewarm.

A prime location suffering from the slackness bred of monopoly, I suspect.</text>

<Review>Beautiful setting in a forests of beautiful trees. Be aware rooms are not air conditioned and summer temps can be problem. Front desk staff was somewhat unfriendly when I told her our window fan wasn't working. Her answer was well we can't guarantee that it can be fixed. So with the granddaughters complaing of the heat inside the room we were fortunately great full when the window fan started to run . It cooled down during the night so that made it bearable. Be forewarned that breakfast was substandard and dinner was bad. My daughters unable to eat their food. In short the natural surrounding of the beautiful sequoia is stunning. But unfortunately  the front desk are unfriendly and robotic</Review><user>107885535009384441489< /user><Date>1532498733180</Date></record></dataset><record>

We just ate dinner at the lodge restaurant. I didn't have a reservation, but the hostess told us we could be sat in about 15 minutes. After waiting for a about thirty minutes, despite being about 5 feet away in direct view of the hostess stand, the hostess acted like she had never seen us before. The dining room was almost empty at this time. The food arrived quickly and was adequate, but the entree portions were miniscule. I've had much better for much less.<//Text>

Looks really nice but for being pretty much the only restaurant this far into the park you would assume they would be open all day. Nope, they close between services for a couple hours.<//Review>

Check-in personnel need to know and share more info about shuttle service. We learned more by overhearing another's conversation. The staff was never rude or mean just not as knowledgeable as we expected. Clean room, hot water was extremely hot and was at times too hot. The room had a fridge but no microwave. The fridge's thermostat was buried under the 'freezer' section's ice and as such it never got the fridge section nicely cold because it always thought it was cold enough. We appreciated the shuttle service but two drvers we had were very curt while another driver was very friendly and helpful. Most shuttle rides were very crowded and we would've done more driving if parking was more generous. The lodge restaurant had, at best, reasonable food but was overpriced and not worth the cost. Given another chance we would buy our food from the lodgepole market (2 miles away) and prepare sandwiches ourselves. Example: day one we bought an $8 burger (from the children's menu) that was worth $16, but on day two we paid $18 for a bison burger which we never want to eat again. The fresh fruit, available at every meal we ate, was always very good but repetitive (pineapple, cantelope, and honeydew). The meal portions we're good. The four stars were mainly due to location and condition of the hotel. It was in a beautiful place and hard to not appreciate the view. Being located within the park saved us an hour plus (minimum) drive each day to reach the sights. We would recommend the lodge and, if we go back, we will stay there again.< /review>

< review>
I really feel this place does a much better job than what I received. There were a lot of headaches in the beginning, but management straightened everything out. The room was clean, the dinner staff was exceptionally friendly and easy-going, and one can not complain about the easy access to the national and state parks. Had it not been for Mr. J, I would have left a 1-star review and a much longer description.

A few side-notes: Dinner is a bit over-priced, they should have wild-caught fish at those price points. I had a couple whiskey-doubles (Glenlivet & Chivas) which put me back 45 bucks, felt like I was at a freaking night-club in San Fran.

Make sure you know whether or not the roads are open via the route you plan to take in. They may close the northern route because of snow and it will suck to have to go ALL the way around (+4 hours minimum).

The team knows the wifi situation is no good. That being said, after speaking with management, the fix they were in the final stages of implementing should solve a lot of problems, looks like I just came on the wrong day. Ignore bad WIFI comments before today's date. If bad WIFI comments persist after March 15 or so, I'd say their solution was no good and they have to continue working on it.

Hope this helps someone!</review>

Great location deep in the Sequoia National Park. Very pretty lodge, nice restaurant, small gift shop, and surrounded by gorgeous forests of trees.</review>

<text>Very dispointed:

The guy at checkin told us our room had a premium view of the mountains (paid300$ CAD for the room) - the only thing we could see was the parking lot

The restaurant : TERRIBLE - ordered pasta with cherry tomatoes - got no flavoured pasta (butter pasta) and no cherry tomatoes, just a regular piece of crushed tomato. It was disgusting.

Every dollar spent here is a mistake. How could people give a 5star review? They must be paid...< /text>< pictures>

< review>
Rooms are basic but ok. Book a topfloor room. Because of tge wooden floors you can hear your upstairs neighbours walk around the room. Ours thought they needed to run a marathon at 4.30 (morning) so it was impossible for us to get more sleep. We just got up early and went for breakfast to find out most of the buffet was allready gone.  Dinner was great tho.  The room we got was not cleaned at all (beds not made, towels all over the ground) so we had to be put in another room. No elavator, wifi limited. Location great</review>

This is one of the absolute best places to stay in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Sequoia National Park Every time we stayed there was a memory of a lifetime. I recommend this place to anyone who visits the Sequoia National Park.< /text>

2 stays, no complaint. Giant Forest Lodge in 1957 and 1961 was among the Big Trees, but is no more. Even our camp ground in Giant Forest has been closed -- for good reason. But I don't agree with the man who say he would rather rent an RV. My rooms, in two separate buildings, for my stays were excellent, and who can complain about walking 200 yards to a quite satisfactory dining room. I gave it only four stars only because the rooms are several hundred yards from the dining room. On our second stay we had wi-fi in our room for free!</Review>

I would definitely stay here again! It was warm and clean. The only downside was the slightly overpriced restaurant. It is in a beautiful location and the sidewalks were quickly cleared in the morning after an overnight snow.<//Review>

went in for lunch on the memorial day weekend. the place was scenic, food reasonable enough. but the lodge and dining room had a feeling that they really didn't want you there.( seemed severely underataffed) took 30 mins to seat us when multiple tables were empty. once we were seated took another 30 mins to take and order and then serve lunch. food was pretty reasonable for the price and I hope this is one off experience due to the memorial day< /text>

I liked everything except the Kitchen closed at 9:30am and if you wake up late you are out of luck.  If you do eat there it’s a bit pricey, I had a $10 simple burger that was good but not great + drink.  No food around for miles.</Review>

Dinner at the restaurant was very tasty. Potatoes were a little underdone but prime rib was delicious.</text>

The location is prime. Set among trails -XC ski, hike or snowshoe, but most impressive are the unique giant trees.< /Review>

Due to the many highly rated reviews, I was expecting more than what I paid for. $230 as a discounted AAA rate isn't peanuts, and for that price I was expecting a resort and not a motel.

First, there is no parking directly in front of the reception for guest to quickly check in. You would still have to park in the parking lot and run to the lobby to check in. I guess I didn't look as good as the previous guest, because I didn't get my room upgraded. Hotel staff greeted me and gave me some brief information to get my stay started.

Upon getting to the rooms, I had to park in a no parking zone to get my bags out. Though there were many luggage carts, there were no attendants to help unload and transport to the room. Baggage was then lugged to the second story up the stairs due to the lack of elevator.

The room was about the same size as an average yet dated Hampton inn with far less amenities. No microwave, no DVD player, different colored bulbs (maybe it's just a pet peeve of mine), each bed had only two small and flat pillows each, linen was pretty rough, and the comforter had stains on them. Corners, curtains, and ceiling fan were dusty and had cob webs. Tub was cracked, tub spout would not operate properly when attempting to switch to the shower head and the shower head was weak and seemed to not operate properly as well. Shower had a soap dispenser, yet you had your choice of lime scented shampoo or lime scented shampoo. The toilet flushed like it was made by NASA and required 300 psi to propel your flush into space (sorry I'll leave the jokes out) it was loud.

The walls are pretty thin and the hotel allows pets. The WiFi is only mediocre in the lobby and pretty much non existent in the rooms. Vending machine was down and there were no other community amenities near the rooms.

For the price I'd expect at least a continental breakfast and due to the lack of activities available at the lodge, there could have been complimentary sack lunches as well (Hampton inn does this free of charge).

I guess I was expecting a camp lodge experience with campfires going to enjoy, s'mores,  and a friendly old bearded guy playing campfire songs for the guests. After all, the experience of seeing the Sequoia are a once in a lifetime experience, and I was hoping the lodging would be as well.

Lastly, if you book online you will be charged a deposit (equivalent to a one night stay), when you check out, the entire bill will be charged to your card. If you used a credit card the deposit will be credited back to your account in a couple days, if debit, 7-30 days depending on your bank.

It is apparent that businesses in these rare locations do not place customer service high on their agenda. Where else would you stay and eat so close to the Sequoia? And I guess this is why they don't have to strive so hard as other competitors.

I'm new at this review thing, though it is well overdue, customer service in this country is not what it used to be. I am not one of those guys that gives jiffy lube coffee a five star rating, and neither should the reviewers (no offense to jiffy lube coffee).

To prove my point, at the end of my stay I was greeted with my bill at the lobby and was not asked how my stay was. Not one to split hairs, but it would have been nice to be asked. Sorry wuksachi lodge, it wasn't worth the visit.

Thank you owner for acknowledging my experience, I post not only to help your business grow but to allow business owners the ability to improve and keep an edge on the corporate conglomerates that corner each market. In any business, customer experience and service should be the corner Stone to any business. Without the customer, there would be no business. The location of your lodge is in a beautiful area and I wish the best of business for you in the future! Regards JV< /Review>

Made reservations 2 months in advance for a two night stay. Paid the first night in advance. Received a phone call at 5:30 PM while on our way to the lodge. Kim informed us that they did not have a room available. She suggested we stay at a motel 30 miles away.

We turned away three guests that night and know that it was a terrible experience for everyone.

We thought we had fixed it, but clearly not. We have since audited all reservations in the system to avoid this in the future.

The pizza was good, however, once we had ordered the pizza, we were told to take it back to our room, at the time there was a couple eating pizza right where we wanted to eat it and the previous night, there were 5+ people eating pizza and other meals there. We asked why they were allowed and we were not and they simply said "they were misinformed". After a fair bit of reasoning, they let us stay and eat it there. There is nothing at the bar where the pizza is ordered telling you you must take it back to your room implying you could eat it there so something as simple as a sign saying "all food must be consumed elsewhere" or something along those lines would let people with the intentions of eating there let them know they can't.

The previous night, we went into the restaurant which seemed nice but, they had a very small menu. We ordered the food and it didn't come out quite right, 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered tasted both stale and burnt unfortunately.

Besides the fact that the room's furniture was dated and the linens had hair on them (white sheets and bedding would be a nice change and would improve the room), the staff were friendly and they would do what they could to help, especially the people at the reception desk< /Review>

<Text>Worst experience I've ever had with a hotel. My family and I arrived at the hotel to check in (the reservation was made and paid for a month and a half ago) and were greeted with the response "you're reservation was canceled by us a few days ago." No sorry, no here's dinner on us, the only advice they had was that Comfort Inn 1 hour away would have a room for us. I had even called the day before to confirm my reservation, "yup you are all set sir, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow." So I drive all the way to the comfort inn to find out they are all booked up as well. So after all that we left Sequoia NP not getting to enjoy our visit like we had imagined (came all the way from Ohio). I still have not seen a refund. Don't bother reserving a room and paying for it in advance, it doesn't matter to them at all!<//Text>< Pics>

We stayed here for one night and it was very good. The room with a king bed was very nice and the bathroom was clean. There was no WLAN at the lodge. In the evenning we had dinner in the restaurant but we had to reserve before. The location around the hotel is great!</text>

Not a lot of options to stay in the park. Lodge is adequate but not quite what the website implies. The "lodge" is cosy but the rooms are not in that building, they are a few minutes away. Room was somewhat dated and had a weird smell. Rollaway beds and cardboard boxes lined the hallway, felt like a storage area. They make you sign a disclaimer to accept that the WiFi is poor... they should tell you before you book that it's unusable (we were relying on it to plan our itinerary). There is one restaurant, food was mixed quality (corn chowder great, potatoes among the worst I've eaten) but those who didn't make a reservation waited a while. It's nice to wake up in the forest and the price was ok compared to other national park hotels but we wouldn't rush back.< /Review>

Service seemed a little lazy at times. Two of us ordered a steak, and they mixed them up giving me the rare and giving the other the medium-rare. Not really that big of a deal, but still a mistake.< /text>

Lovely room. Friendly staff. Food at the Restaurant is not for everyone (salad with Shrimps or blue cheese...). The food is expensive. Great distance to all Major sightseeings. The lodge is great for wildlife watching. Deers Roaming around the parking Lot. It is active bear area. WiFi Not really useable.<//Review>

<text>My girl friend and I spend a couple of night at Wuksachi Lodge 2nd week of July 2012. Following is our observations:Restaurant price is very high and quality of the food is incredibly poor. Avoid the restaurant.Bar prices are also very high. It is a highway robbery.A/C in the room was noisy and inadequate. Room was OK.Staff is friendly.ADVICE: Load up your car with beer, wine, drinks and food. STAY AWAY from Wuksachi restaurant and bar.<//text><gmapID>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019<//gmapID></record>

Rate was expensive. Restaurant was awful. My server was unattentive and I ended up paying for the entree portion of the ravioli when I had specifically ordered the appetizer portion. They should take the cheese platter off the menu because the crackers and cheese I got were stale and flavorless. French onion soup is generally served with baguette and cheese on top, I was served only the broth. The reataurant tries to be five star but they fail horribly.The room was good but still too expensive. Walls are thin, I could hear all my neighbors.< /Text>

The restraunt at the lodge leaves much to be desired. The wait staff left us without water numerous times and at 5pm, were out of quite a few entree choices on the menu. We enjoyed the views here, but began to loathe dining in the restaurant every night. The dinner options were overpriced, whilr vegetarian and gluten free options were limited mostly to salads. I do not recommend the vegetarian burger or "field roast". Wi-Fi here is the slowest I have experineced. Staying in the lodge was fine, but our room had no air conditioning and no elevator. It was clean and adequate for our stay with lots of wildlife right outside our door. Deer and bears were seen by members in our party.<//review>

<Date>1468737794497</Date><rating>3<//rating><review>There is no A/C. At night it gets cool enough that this isn't a major problem, but I still wished for it once or twice. You will have no cell coverage at all - phone, texting, data - nothing. That's true in pretty much the whole park, so nothing against the hotel, but be aware that their wifi is abysmal, so while, yes, you CAN get SOME things online, be sure to have downloaded all your maps, audio books, guides, and whatever else you were planning on using while you were here BEFORE you come. Again, the hotel probably can't get anything better, so this is more of a warning than a complaint. TIP: if you are coming as a group, consider getting long-range walkie talkies or something like that.

The water comes out of the tap at a VERY slow rate - 28.8 ml / second or .46 gallons / minute. I understand the need to conserve water, but it shouldn't take a full minute to fill up 2 water bottles.

My door didn't close all the way unless you pulled on it, which in and of itself wasn't a big deal, but lent to the general feeling that this building is older and could use a bit of a freshening up, although I acknowledge that some may find it more of a charming, quaint sort of feel and prefer it that way.

As far as I could tell, the only difference bergen the standard and deluxe rooms was that the more expensive ones are ever so slightly bigger and have a chair. Big woop - I recommend the cheaper room unless you have a need for a few extra square feet of space.

You must walk a short distance from the car to your room. Some may like the feeling of remoteness that this gives, but it isn't particularly handicap-friendly, if that's an issue for you.

The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the location was fantastic. Really, when you get right down to it, that's all that really matters, right?</review>< pictures>

This is a review strictly on the reservations line not on the hotel. I booked online and had to cancel due to bad weather. After several days, I called to check on my refund of the deposit. The man on the reservation line was reluctant to assist me and was quite rude. I am in customer service myself and cancellations are unfortunate but certainly no reason to be terse.< /review>

< review>
I stayed here because of its proximity to the Giant Forest at Sequoia.  There are actually no giant sequoias that I saw in the lodge area--you need to drive a few minutes down the road.  The room I stayed in was nice.  It had no air conditioning--just a window fan--but a/c wasn't needed during my stay in early August, as daytime highs were only in the low 70's.  WiFi was extremely slow, but free.  There's no cell phone signal here as of the time of this review, so you really need the WiFi if you feel the need to be connected to the outside world.  The lodge's restaurant--The Pines--was adequate (not fantastic), and the bottled beers quite expensive.  The all-you-can eat barbecue dinner at nearby Wolverton was a nice change.  Overall, a perfectly enjoyable stay.<//review>

By reviewing the reviews, recent reviews (within 3-weeks) show bad experiences, and also there are no owner responses, or apology for reviews with bad experiences.

<Review>This not Giant Forest Lodge.
It is a place to stay in Sequoia.
I found that I could rent a small RV for what they charge to stay here. Next time I will rent the RV and stay at Lodge pole. WL is pleasent enough, but the design of separate lodging buildings from lobby and reasturant make it feel like no architect was used. You cannot drive up to the front door to check in. The long paths to the lodging buildings are poorly maintained. Be prepared to lug your bags up and down stairs. Rooms could have had balconies to enjoy the lodge pole forest but the design doesn't understand that we are here to be involved with nature. The real shocker was the notice that the water does not meet California standards. Breakfast buffett was executed poorly. The food was often cold and dishes not available to serve ones self. Tables and chairs were crammed in so guests often were bumping into seated dinners.
The wifi worked well in my room, but that's not why I am here.
The beds are soft and they have no backboards.
Got rained out of Ranger talk at lodge pole and came back to dine early.  Even though there were open tables I was told I had to wait. When seated, got bread with oil but no vinigar.  Getting hot water refills while waiting for dinner was difficult.  It took 50 minutes for food to arrive.  My wife got plain dried out and cold rice instead of what was ordered.  The whole operation with armature and inefficient.  Definatly a disappointment at high prices
Update: Delaware North is wants big money for names in National Parks. The Parks and the names are our patrimony.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1390262562728, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear that your stay did not meet your expectations, but are very glad you took the time to share your insights with us.

Tilting Lumpy uncomfortable beds. Food was eh even the 38 lamb shank. Servers were not trained well and our six hikers were left thirsty most of the meal.</review>

This place must be an experiment how bad service can become having no competition.

At check-in: "you are too early - check in is at 4 pm" without checking at all whether the room could be available.

If you plan to go there - take your own food with you or plenty of time to wait in the most chaotic restaurant of the world. I have never seen so many people running around so uncoordinated.

Rooms - ok - but attitude of staff totally unacceptable. Every Dollar spent here is too much.

I cannot understand the 5/5 ratings. Are these guys paid ?</text>

We swung by the lodge just to see it during our trip to Sequoia. We were traveling with a toddler and discovered that even if you're not staying there, it's worth a stop to enjoy the view and provide a change of pace for the kids.< /Text>

<text>Stop by if you need lodging or a meal. Snowshoe rental is downstairs.

Stopped by to checkout the lodge as it was mentioned in a number of guides. There is a small gift shop, a restaurant and another small food shop downstairs where you can rent snow shoes. There is nothing in the way of tourist attractions here.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80955e7bbfa947a1:0x569f3289d86ec019</gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) We had a great time. The beauty of the park around it was amplified by a very strong snowfall of the days before which made everything even more beautiful. The structure is warm and welcoming. Our room was clean and large with a nice window facing the snowy forest upstream. I believe, given the fact that there are not many structures in the area, that it is advisable to book early ... if you have already decided a date ... certainly covid permitting.

(Original)
Siamo stati benissimo. La bellezza del parco intorno è stata amplificata da una fortissima nevicata dei giorni prima che hanno reso il tutto ancora più bello. La struttura è calda e accogliente. La nostra stanza era pulita e grande con un bella finestra verso sul bosco innevato a monte. Credo, considerato il fatto che non sono molte le strutture in zona, che sia consigliabile prenotare per tempo...se avete già deciso una data...certo covid permettendo.< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) A haven of peace in the heart of nature. We did not meet any bears in this season, but a doe and her little ones scampered at the feet of our room.
The room and the bed are very big and comfortable. The restaurant is good. Helpful staff. No effective internet connection, but it pauses during the holidays.
At this price, the bathroom could be more modern, it feels like a basic motel.

(Original)
Un havre de paix en plein cœur de la nature. Nous n'y avons pas rencontré d'ours en cette saison, mais une biche et ses petits trottinaient aux pieds de notre chambre.
La chambre et le lit sont très grands et confortables. Le restaurant est bon. Le personnel serviable. Pas de connexion internet efficace, mais ça fait une pause pendant les vacances.
A ce prix, la salle de bain pourrait être plus moderne, on a l'impression d'être dans un motel basique.<//text>< rating>

(Translated by Google) The Wuksachi Lodge unfortunately lives alone on their location. The reception was surprisingly unfriendly and they frittered you off hectic. The room was ok, but not very clean (hair on the pillows, carpet dirty). Nice was the towel, which was folded into a bear and positioned on one of the beds. Amazingly bad is the in-house restaurant: of five dishes was a cold, one was totally over-salted and was also charged too expensive. And that anyway already "salted" prices. Not surprisingly, meals went back at many tables. Only the dessert was convincing, but the service was poor: drinks were forgotten and complaints were hardly received. When we then refrained from tipping was actually asked how much tip we want to give. When we explained our intention to give none, we were briskly finished. Overall, I advise the accommodation conditionally, the food but definitely to alternatives. 2 stars only for the location and because the accommodation is basically ok.

(Original)
Die Wuksachi Lodge lebt leider allein von ihrer Lage. Der Empfang war erstaunlich unfreundlich und man wurde hektisch abgefrühstückt. Das Zimmer war ok, aber nicht ganz sauber (Haare auf den Kopfkissen, Teppichboden dreckig). Nett war das Handtuch, das zu einem Bären gefaltet und auf einem der Betten positioniert war. Erstaunlich schlecht ist das hauseigene Restaurant: von fünf Speisen wurde eine kalt serviert, eine war total versalzen und wurde auch noch zu teuer abgerechnet. Und das bei sowieso schon "gesalzenen" Preisen. Nicht verwunderlich, dass Speisen an vielen Tischen zurück gingen. Einzig der Nachtisch konnte überzeugen, jedoch war auch der Service mangelhaft: Getränke wurden vergessen und auf Beanstandungen kaum eingegangen. Als wir dann davon abgesehen haben Trinkgeld zu geben wurde tatsächlich nachgefragt wie viel Trinkgeld wir denn geben wollen. Als wir unsere Absicht keines zu geben erläuterten wurden wir forsch zu Ende bedient. Insgesamt rate ich bei der Unterkunft bedingt, beim Essen aber auf jeden Fall zu Alternativen. 2 Sterne nur für die Lage und weil die Unterkunft grundsätzlich in Ordnung ist.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) During our honeymoon we stayed in this Hotel, like so many other facilities, did not offer special treatment for newlyweds. The structure is nice and clean spread over different areas, the restaurant must be booked upon arrival also because there are no alternatives in the area. We also had fun with the luggage trolley! 😁

(Original)
Durante la nostra luna di miele abbiamo soggiornato in questo Hotel, come tante altre strutture non offriva un trattamento speciale per i neo sposi. La struttura è bella e pulita dislocata su diverse aree, il ristorante va prenotato all'arrivo anche perché non ci sono alternative in zona. Ci siamo anche divertiti con il carrello trasporta bagagli! 😁< /Review>< gmapID>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Haunted! Myself and my husband had problems getting to the place but when we finally got the attention it was superb the room just as my husband likes to clean large and very cozy and he looks very demanding! Restaurant food delicious tasty and accessible breakfast certainly a very beautiful place without thinking twice we would return to this beautiful place.😍😘

Encantada! yo y mi esposo tuvimos problemas para llegar al lugar pero cuando finalmente llegamos la atención fue magnífica la habitación justo como a mi esposo le gusta limpia grande y muy acogedora y mira que el es muy exigente! La comida del restaurante deliciosa desayunos sabrosos y accesibles sin duda un lugar muy hermoso sin pensarlo dos veces volveríamos a este hermoso lugar.😍😘< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Wartezeit Checkin ca 15 Minuten bis wir drankamen. Zimmer nur sehr schlecht erreichbar, da die Wege nicht ausreichend vom Schnee geräumt wurden. Es war nur ein kleiner Durchgang, man müsste die Koffer ca 100m tragen. Rollen war nicht möglich, weil der Untergrund steinig war. Restaurant: wir hatten reserviert, trotzdem müssten wir uns hinten anstellen, hinter allen die nicht reserviert hatten. Ich fragte mach einem Tisch am Fenster, der Kellner sagte die sind nur für ab 4 Personen. Komisch, nach uns wurden die ersten beiden Paare direkt and Fenster gesetzt. Steak habe ich well-done bestellt, es kam aber Medium. Es wurde nochmal auf den Grill gelegt. Für einen Preis von 33$ nicht zu entschuldigen.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1554854400000<//Time><user_id>None< /user_id><pics>None<//pics><name>Expedia reviewer</name><Rating>None<//Rating>< GmapID>

<review>Die hat eine Traumlage aber das war es auch schon. Alles Andere ist einfach schrecklich. Von Benutzer Bettwäsche über schmutzige Toiletten und öffentliche Bereiche über unfreundliches Personal im Housekeeping war alles unterirdisch. Das Personal im Restaurant war sehr nett. Der Zimmerpreis ist überzogen. Unser Bett müsste Nachts nach der Amreise noch neu bezogen werden, weil die Haare vom vorherigen Gast im gesamten Bett lagen. Der zuständige Mitarbeiter war extrem genervt und fragte uns mehrmals, ob wir das Bett nicht selber beziehen möchten. Nachdem wir ihm zeigten, dass die Kissen auch schmutzig sind, schlug er genervt seine Hände auf die Oberschenkel und verlies das Zimmer.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The place is just super !!! The most convenient location for exploring the park. Great restaurant, recommend steaks. Free parking. The room is large, clean, but the sheets are shabby, holes in the bedspread. The price is a bit high, like mountains)) Check-in at 16.00. There is a coffee maker in the room, but on the second day they did not replenish the supply of coffee and tea. I recommend staying for two nights this is the best time, you will have time to inspect everything and will not waste your way from the valley to the mountains. The Internet is bad, in some places there is no alternative cellular connection, where there is no dinner. Therefore, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The kitchen is excellent especially steaks, better in quality is not the most expensive. Did not really like to have dinner at 17.00. another time was groaned. The problem with the places, therefore, must be recorded early.

(Original)
Место просто супер!!! Самое удобное расположение для осмотра парка. Отличный ресторан, рекомендую стейки. Свободная парковка. Номер большой, чисто, но постельное белье потрепанное, дырки в  покрывале. Цена высоковата, как горы)) Заезд в 16.00. Есть кофеварка в номере, но на Второй день не пополнили запас кофе и чая. Рекомендую остановиться на две ночи это самое оптимальное время, успеете все осмотреть и не будете тратить дорогу из долины в горы. Интернет плохой, сотовая связь местами отсутствует альтернативы, где поужинать нет. Поэтому ужинали в ресторане отеля. Кухня отличная особенно стейки, лучше по качеству не самый дорогой. Не очень понравилось ужинать в 17.00. другое время было щанято. Проблема с местами поэтому надо записываться заренее.</text>

(Translated by Google) The only place in our entire journey where we could drink untreated spring water as it comes out of the spring. Beautiful location in the woods of the Sequoia National Park, beautiful panorama from the dining room window, good food, average portions, slightly high prices. Recommended

L'unico posto in tutto il nostro viaggio in cui abbiamo potuto bere acqua di fonte non trattata, così come esce dalla sorgente. Splendida location in mezzo ai boschi del Sequoia National Park, panorama bellissimo dalla vetrata della sala da pranzo, buon cibo, porzioni nella media, prezzi leggermente alti. Consigliato</Review>

<Text>L’établissement a envoyé un mail deux heures avant notre arrivée pour nous signaler qu’il n’y aura pas d’eau. Donc pas de douche, pas de restaurant, pas de petit déjeuner avec deux enfants en bas âge c’est compliqué...L’hôtel rembourse si on avait réservé en direct chez eux mais hélas on est passé chez Expedia qui eux ne veulent rien savoir donc plus de 200 euros à la poubelle. C’est ma première expérience avec Expedia et c’est ma dernière...<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) It is a pleasant hotel with mountain hotel character. Rooms in the, restaurant: open hall. But everything is and dear. Much more important is that you live here in the middle of the forest and directly has the jungle in front of the door. The great old sweetheart (🌲) can only be hiked by Peres and only in days long hikes. I also saw the (last) bear.

(Original)
Es ist ein angenehmes Hotel mit Berghotel Charakter. Zimmer im, Restaurant : offene Halle. Aber alles ist und lieb. Viel wichtiger ist dass man hier mitten im Wald wohnt und direkt den Urwald vor der Türe hat. Die tollen alten Schätzchen (🌲)  kann man nur per Peres erwandern und nur in tagelangen Wanderungen.Da habe ich auch den (letzten) Bären gesehen.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) If you have to carry all your luggage from the parking area to your room, that is extremely annoying. Also the other way around from your room to the parking lot. It is not allowed to stand a few seconds with the car at the top of the entrance door. You are requested to immediately remove your car. Also no carts to move your luggage.

(Original)
Als je al je bagage vanaf het parkeerterrein naar je kamer moet sjouwen is dat buitengewoon vervelend. Ook andersom van je kamer naar het parkeerterrein. Het is niet toegestaan enkele tellen met de auto boven bij de toegangsdeur te staan. Je wordt verzocht DIRECT je auto te verwijderen. Ook geen karretjes om je bagage te verplaatsen.<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) We had the expectations of a rustic, clean mountain hotel by the previous stay in the Tenaya Lodge. What Wuksachi offers, however, are by European standards a maximum of 2 stars, but all for a (European imaginary price for 4-5 stars) The reception was cold, stressed and unfriendly. The houses are relatively far away from the lodge itself. The hallways of the houses do not give the impression that they are cleaned on a regular basis. The same goes for the rooms and especially for the windows. The bathrooms are ugly and unkempt with plastic shower trays. Breakfast was ok, but served in a (very) cold dining room. I would book the next visit a hotel in the valley and for the long journey in purchase.

(Original)
Wir hatten durch den vorherigen Aufenthalt in der Tenaya Lodge die Erwartungshaltung an eine rustikales, sauberes Berghotel. Was Wuksachi bietet, sind jedoch für europäische Verhältnisse maximal 2 Sterne, alles jedoch für einen (europäisch gedachten Preis für 4-5 Sterne) Der Empfang war kalt, gestresst und unfreundlich. Die Häuser sind relativ weit weg von der Lodge selbst. Die Flure der Wohnhäuser erwecken nicht den Eindruck als würden diese in regelmäßigen Abständen geputzt. Dasselbe gilt für die Zimmer und vor allem auch für die Fenster. Die Bäder sind unschön und ungepflegt mit Duschwannen aus Kunststoff. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung, wird aber in einem (sehr) kalten Speisesaal serviert. Ich würde beim nächsten Besuch ein Hotel im Tal buchen und dafür auch die lange Anfahrt in Kauf nehmen.</review><user_name>Felix Hirt<//user_name>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) The setting seemed perfect if we could enjoy it! After 7 hours drive we discover that the hotel was wrong in the booking date. They did nothing to correct their mistake as we found another hotel at their expense which was the minimum! And the height? No excuses were made to us! Unpleasant and pedantic team unable to properly handle their customers. At your peril !

(Translated by Google) We would have been originally with 5 people-Fortunately, we were at check-in then only 4 of the original 2 rooms, of course, we were fully booked half a year ago, was only a room in the system noted. We had to squeeze us to 4 in a room with small sofa bed. The lodge now stated afterwards that the reservation was a different name, although we checked all the names on the spot. Now it is difficult to get the money back. Unfortunately, an Italian family who arrived on the same day in the evening was worse off. Their room was not available at all and they had to drive 50km to the next accommodation late in the evening. Apparently you have to adjust to it

(Original)
Wir wären ursprünglich mit 5 Personen unterwegs gewesen-Zum Glück waren wir beim Check-in dann nur noch 4. von den ursprünglich 2 Zimmern, die uns natürlich vollständig 1/2 Jahr vorher abgebucht wurden, war nur ein Zimmer im System vermerkt. Wir mussten uns dann zu 4 in ein Zimmer mit kleiner Ausziehcouch quetschen. Die Lodge gab jetzt im Nachhinein an, dass die Reservierung auf einen anderen Namen lieg, obwohl wir vor Ort alle Namen kontrolliert haben. Jetzt ist es schwierig das gezahlte Geld zurück zu bekommen. Einer Italienischen Familie, die erst abends am gleichen Tag ankamen erging es leider noch schlechter. Ihr Zimmer war überhaupt nicht verfügbar und sie mussten nach spät abends 50km zur nächsten Unterkunft fahren. Scheinbar muss man sich darauf einstellen</Review>

(Translated by Google) Obviously the park is beautiful, I went in March and I had snow, everything looked very nice. The rooms of the hotel are expensive and the quality of the mattresses is not very good, but if you are looking for a place in the highest part of the mountains that is a good option, because in the lower parts of the mountain there was no snow . The hotel restaurant also too expensive, not so rich. However, one understands that what you are paying is not the hotel but the landscape.

(Original)
Obviamente el parque es hermoso, fui en marzo y me tocó nieve, todo se veía muy lindo. Los cuartos del hotel son carísimos y la calidad de los colchones no es muy buena, pero si buscas un lugar en lo más alto de las montañas esa es muy buena opción, pues en las partes más bajas de la montaña ya no había nada de nieve. El restaurante del hotel también demasiado caro, no está tan rico. Sin embargo, uno entiende que lo que estas pagando no es el hotel sino el paisaje.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Usually I don't pay much attention to hotels but this one in particular is not the best. Simply the attention is good from the staff but as far as the rooms are not bad, but for what you pay they are not worth so much, yes, the views of this place are simply impressive. I recommend it? Not much but what is being paid here is not the rooms but the place.

We experienced the rudest check-in in almost 40 years of travelling around the world. The lady at the front desk told us in an arrogant and smug tone that the phones are not working, the internet will be slow due to a satellite link and that we have to remove all food from the car. Later when we inquired about breakfast options the same lady showed us her total unwillingness to give us the infos - as we interrupted her chat with coworkers. One of the guests helped out. As we didnt want to see these folks again we went to Lodgepole for food and other needs.The lodge is in a great location in the middle of the national park not far from the huge trees. The room was basic but clean. But the stairs and aisles were dirty. Broken phones and a lousy internet might be ok in Africa last century but not in the US today.And we expected a quiet night in the forest but the noise from the ventilation system keeps you up half of the night. We would definitely not return.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Rather dated room without any charm
HS air conditioning
Bathroom in its own juice

The restaurant opens at 7 a.m. and closes at 9 a.m.
You have to stand in line for 3 hours

Not much to remember from this hotel which benefits from its location in the center of the park
Like many others elsewhere

Chambre plutôt vieillotte sans aucun charme

Salle de bain dans son jus

(Translated by Google) It's fine to be so far from civilization. But they say they have wifi when only hotel employees can access, that is, you are almost totally cut off. They do not know how to say well if the use of chains corresponds to a day of snow. The cleanliness of the rooms is somewhat poor. The restaurant is very good!, Both at night and at breakfast. The supermarket is a bit far away and they have few things in the hotel.

(Original)
Esta bien para estar tan lejos de la civilización. Pero dicen tener wifi cuando solo los empleados del hotel pueden acceder, es decir que estás casi totalmente incomunicado.

(Translated by Google) Beautiful place to stay and make several walks in the park influencing Moro Rock, Sunset Rock, Topokah Valley and of course visit the bulkier sequoia called General Sherman. The room I was in had two queen beds very comfortable. The hot bath water was very good and in addition the room service was excellent. I should mention that when you stay in Wuksachi you only have the option of having breakfast, lunch and dinner in the restaurant of the place. It is a little expensive, but waiting to get good food in such a repoto place. The dining options specifically were very good. Breakfast not so good. And lunch I can not comment since I did not treat it. Finally it is important to remember chains for the tires of the car during the winter since the snowfalls are common during the cold season.

(Original)
Lugar hermoso para hospedarse y lograr hacer varias caminatas en el parque influyendo Moro Rock, Sunset Rock, Topokah Valley y por supuesto visitar al secoya mas voluminoso llamado General Sherman. La habitación en la cual estuve tenía dos camas tamaño queen muy comodas. El agua del baño caliente estuve muy buena y adicionalmente el servicio del cuarto fue excelente. Debo mencionar que al hospedarse en Wuksachi uno solo tiene la opción de desayunar, almorzar y cenar en el restaurante del lugar. Es un poco caro, pero esperando para obtener buena comida en un lugar tan repoto. Las opciones de cenar específicamente fueron muy buenas. El desayuno no tan bueno. Y de almuerzo no puedo comentar ya que no lo traté. Finalmente es importante recordar cadenas para las llantas del auto durante el invierno ya que las nevadas son comunes durante la temporada fria.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It is located at the top of the mountain, only strategic by the views. One is almost forced to eat there because of how complicated and late it is to get there. The lobby is far from the rooms. The door of my room did not close and the heating was bad.
