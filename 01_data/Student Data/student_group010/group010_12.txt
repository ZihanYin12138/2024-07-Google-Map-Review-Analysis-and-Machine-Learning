<review>GREAT SERVICE!!  These guys go above and beyond to make this experience exceptional!! Cris and Ethan did a great job. Any negative review on these guys for having long hair is just childish!! Chris has been here long enough (8-years!) to prove himself as a worthy employee. My truck rental experience was outstanding. And, don't be jealous, dude's hair rocks!!< /review>< user_name>

This location always seems to have what my company needs. The staff is always polite and does what they can to expedite customers, even when busy. Nobody is perfect, but this location always manages to take care of us and our rental needs. We have many Uhaul locations to choose from, but this is our #1<//review>

<gmapID>0x809ae7e91f5d1759:0xa5f2b8677afe6739< /gmapID><review>Apparently their policy is to only give customers two days to pick up their deposit refund if they can't get ahold of them, despite the fact that they literally cater to people who are in the middle of moving and thus might be a bit busy to answer a call from an unknown number. It has now been two weeks, and I have not received the check they sent, assuring me that it would arrive a week ago.
In addition, when I requested the associate I was dealing with simply not call me sir, and explained that "sir" and "ma'am" is archaic and only serves to make it more likely you will misgender your customers, the other associate seemed to think this was funny.

The truck was fine, renting it was fine, but everything around that experience was subpar.<//review><username>Valraven Apocalypse<//username>< userid>

Great location. The general manager Chris and his team are a true credit to U-Haul. Lines may be long but everyone is always multitasking and ready to serve with a smile once it's your turn. They define the can and will do customer service attitude.</review>

<review>Whoever the two guys working tonight are, there great. I was in a rush trying to get to my storage in time with a truck full of my stuff from the bay area. The place there broke the trailer getting it onto the back of the uhaul, so It was stuck. They got it off and had me out in 3 minutes even while juggling there other customers. NEED ANYTHING GO HERE.</review>< pics>

Reserved a truck the night before.  Ordered supplies.  Everything was ready despite a very busy day.  Nicholas was great and got me quickly checked in and on my way.  He also checked me back in and was just as efficient.  Great facility, lots of cool supplies and great customer service!  A+</Review>

Made a reservation 5 days in advance. Kept getting calls saying that they had switched the trailer size (to one that wouldn't work) and then told us they didn't have the one I reserved online. Then they said never mind, they had it and then called an hour later saying the trailer was "down for maintenance".

Never had this bad of an experience at a u-haul, not going to be coming back.<//Text>

Terrible location. Unfriendly employees. Unlike other locations on this location they require your personal phone number and a friend or family so they can call and check your identity!! More like  a harrassment and invasion of privacy. I'm not going there again. They're rude, inefficient and confused. Nothing like other uhaul places. They waisted my time and ruined my weekend moving plan.< /review>

They are very busy on the weekends. Make sure you use all the automation they provide. Self check in online and auto return if you return the vehicle after hours, you want to take the verification  pictures while your still sitting in the vehicle. The employees are nice and efficient.< /Review>

Very unprofesional. Made a reservation in advance,and drove all the way from L.A. to Gold River,7 hours drive.to find no trailer i could rent.They reschedule my reservation on the same day I was to pick up the trailer, two hours drive from Gold River.
I refused to do that drive.The sales person told me he would try to find me a trailer and he would call me in less than  30 minutes.
two hours and no trailer.I had to drive back empty to L.A.I will probably never use uhaul again</Text>

<review>Honestly waiting for over 40 minutes for propane since 1 guy can do it an he is installing a hitch.  Now the line is up to 3 people waiting for propane.  Don't recommend unless you have an afternoon to kill.

Was one star but after how Chris took care of me, I will come back everytime< /review><time>1522705977751</time>< Rate>

called uhaul. they told me all they need is 2 form of ID. went to this location and provided my valid driver license and valid credit card. the guy ask for my number which i already provided on my reservation. they called the number and verified it and keep asking for a business phone number or second number. i don't have 2 numbers all i had was 1 valid number. if you are not white prepare for a lot of assurance or they may cancel your reservation. they canceled my reservation. they will racially profiling you. contacted the uhaul and they said they dont know why they ask for more than whats required . gave me a another number to call , the number was not good number.< /Review>

Kinda pricy for only an hour, plus your charged by the mile as well. Overall good service and even helped after hours, truck was clean, and no issues besides the price.</text>

<Review>GM was the only one working and willing to help.
The inside staff didn't greet me when I walked in the door nor did they actually help me. I left when they told me I had to talk with the GM about what would happen if I got stuck in traffic and wasn't back at the perfect hour.
I drove away and found out they canceled my reservation before I was gone 10 min.
Won't go back, wouldn't recommend.< /Review>< pics>

These guys are the truck rental police. I rented a pickup for two hours to move some furniture that I bought for my home. I paid about $60 for two hours, and when I got back, I was interrogated about every aspect of the truck. The employee asked me to step back inside the vehicle and start it up. Tf is that about?

These guys need a visit from U-Haul HQ to get their act together. Will not be going to this location again.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The manager is more concerned with his hairstyle than he is with customer service.  What I was told on the phone was drastically different than what I was told in the store.  Huge waste of time.</review>

Good place to shop, use their digital coupons which are a great bargain. They have a deli counter with great options. The soups are delicious at their salad bar</text>

That market sell groceries and items for double price more than other markets around the area. Price are crazy and many low income people buy their groceries or any other item there just because is the nearest market and people sometimes doesn’t have a car to go another store. This store need to be reported is too much expensive they are increased prices horrible during Covid-19.< /Text>

Bad customer service.  Tried to steal.  Over charging.  When I asked for a receipt I noticed they were charging me for extra items that I did not purchase.  Not the first time this has happened.</review>

<Review>I live close by on Nob Hill but always walk to the Whole Foods down in SOME.  I found myself around Pacific Heights today and was really craving a good salad, so I slipped in here for the first time.  I can't say I was impressed with this Whole Foods... The salad bar didn't have half the ingredients as the location in SOME does (no sundries tomatoes, no mixed olives, no red pepper slices, no bleu cheese crumbles, no cups out for the salad dressing).  This location also felt much more cramped than others I've been to. However, I did love the free sample tables they had set up, and the checkout lines moved super fast.  The produce section was top notch, as expected from Whole Foods.  Overall, I'd go back because it's close and convenient... but I'll pass on the salad bar.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1541108788918, 'text': 'Hi Ms.Hernandez,\n\nI would like to thank you for the review, unfortunately the location you have reviewed is a market store located close to USC, between Jefferson Blvd and Normandie Ave, named El Rey market.  You can always visit us at 1471 W Jefferson Blvd. Hope you have wonderful day and if possible you can modify the review or leave it as is.

I’ve been coming here for a while now and they have friendly customer service and amazing meat to grill!

<text>When I pull up an employee is outside on the phone smoking. He goes in. I go in and the other employee is on phone helping customer. I walk around, cant find what I need, guy still on phone helping customer, other employee no where to be seen. I cant get help so I leave, then I see the employee that was outside smoking when I arrived back outside sitting in the shade smoking and surfing rhe inernet on his phone. LOL. Im going to NAPA, they always have someone to help that is more knowledgeable than these guys anyways. Here a photo of the smoker.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZV4R1oMwiH5Wiklz1XhnNH3bQmqx1Egbjr0n0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_id>115377611657417806503< /user_id>< name>

On 7-28-20 I called to verify part availability. Leo the manager answered and provided me with quick service. He told me to hold a minute which I did, I didn’t know he was going to grab the part. I told him I’d be on my way to pick it and make sure it was already at front counter. He said it’s already here just give associate your telephone number. His excellent service in preparing everything before I even asked is customer service that keeps me coming back. Also I had a part under warranty and he looked up to verify and exchanged hassle free. I will be coming back when they have my parts that I need at this store.<//Text>

My rented car had some battery issues, Executive named 'Leo' helped me with free checkup and diagnosed that it was issue with alternator. Showed me how it works on computer, and showed it to me in my car. He advised me how to get it fixed.

This was my first ever visit to an AutoZone, and they won my heart with their service & helping nature.<//Text><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

Went to buy a radiator and was told it will be arriving the same day at 7:30pm. I go to pick it up to be told that the item did not make it, and will be arriving at 10am the next day. So I go back the next morning to be told that the item had not arrived and that it had to be paid before ordering but yet even though there own employee the day before told me that I can pay for it once It had arrived. They literally throw each others problems to one another. Very disappointing. What a waste of TIME. Will not recommend... O'Rielly's here I come.<//Text>

<Review>Placed an order with them for a part I needed. They didn’t have it so they ordered it and told me it would arrive in store in two days. Two times i went in and it was cancelled “mysteriously” both times. Finally, just decided to ask for my money back and went to oreilleys instead.< /Review></record>

Wonderful experience at AJ’s! The employee, Angelica, was very knowledgeable in the instruments department. I had been looking for rosin for my violin and without any questions, she had showed me the different kinds they had and explained how much they were being sold for each. Angelica was also kind enough to help me in the jewelry department since I was looking for a necklace for an upcoming birthday. She helped me look through affordable options and showed me the different charms a necklace could contain. Overall, Angelica was super helpful and would recommend going to AJ’s for instrumental objects and jewelry handling/purchasing.</review>

<Text>I was helped by Cheryl, such a great, pleasant customer service and support she provides, she was patiently waiting for me to see the items, and would be knowledgeable in any questions I had about the jewelry. Left very happy with my purchase choices and would definitely recommend and will return for more future purchases. The store was very clean, very safe environment and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! 💯🙏< /Text></record>

<Text>The woman who helped me out was super cool even at 930 am on a Saturday and everything always goes super smooth at AJ’s super pawn. Never any hassles and they loan you what’s deserved 90 percent of the time. LOL. But seriously good people and good business and no I don’t get paid for this shit😂😂</Text>< pictures>

Great place to go when you need cash right away. Staff knowledgeable and very friendly. You can pay interest by debit card and they now have it online to pay. No need to go into the store and stand in line. This is a plus!< /review>

Friendly service. Loan terms are right about where any pawn shop would be. They have been around for a long time. If you have to go to a pawn shop, go to this one.<//text>

<text>Been to many different pawn shops in the area and this place is the best. The customer service is phenomenal, Marco has helped me out everytime that I have gone. Marco is the best at what he does, super helpful, informative, friendly, the man really provides the best customer service I have ever received. He is definitely the reason I keep coming back.<//text><rate>5< /rate><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<review>Heard about this place by a buddy of mine down in Hemet, Ca and was extremely satisfied with Marco's Mendez customer service.

<Text>I've been a customer of AJs for about 2 years now, driving from Riverside, CA to Pomona. Why? Because the staff is courteous, kind, respectful and genuinely helpful. In the midst of this pandemic, AJs has kept their costs the same. When other companies were gouging the American people, AJs still gave more for your items and kept reasonable interest rates. I think they are one of the best in this business.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< Review>
This is my go to pawn shop. Honest and fair. They don’t charge interest if you pick your item up before 30 days. They will just charge you the ticket price of $3. They for the most part take everything I bring to them. And even are willing to work past my final due date if I don’t have the money to take it out right away. I’d definitely recommend hem to anyone who is in need of a loan.</Review>

This place is clean, safe, huge selection of jewelry, thats for sure, and many other items as well (music, games, knives, etc.,). Ive been going here for over 15 years and the only problem ive run n2 is with customer service. I give it 3 stars out of 5. A few workers could develope better "tact" with their interactions with the customers. Over all i give 4 stars.<//text>

<review>AJ's pawn shop stands out compared to any other pawn shop in the Inland Empire not only do they have a superior selection of musical equipment tools games and electronics but they have staff members that know every item inside and out and are more than happy to talk to you about them. From the perspective of a pawner the staff does a great job of always making sure the customer feels respected and welcomed. AJ's pawn shop is like a mini Superstore that pawns things on the side they are truly a gem and a one-of-a-kind<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>Went in to shop as opposed to pawn. Offered assistance only after we were leaving. Nice store, great range of products, and pretty organized. Some prices were a bit hard to find (some items were missing tags) and prices were hit or miss. Especially with tools and jewelry, prices were around 20% below MSRP, so it depends on what you want. For tools, items were mostly medium to heavy wear, and thus the asking price seemed a bit high. Jewelry was in excellent condition and displayed beautifully. Poor price if evaluating based on scrap value plus item condition but a great price for people wanting something quick, specific, and competitively priced compared to chain stores. Would definitely recommend checking out. I think there's almost always something for most people in pawn stores, and this was one of the nicer stores in the area.

I apologize if I sound too critical, but I used to work at a chain pawn store and specialized in evaluating jewelry. Despite coworkers, I loved the prices, products, and customer service. I was actually a customer first. They were in need of a pawn broker so they said to apply, and the rest is history. I just wanted to give my honest review of your store, which is, in fact, my favorite in the area thus far (moved to SoCal in August)!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I;m sorry you weren't greeted when you came in, we will certainly work on that in the future.  As for the pricing on our games, unfortunately, game prices fluctuate dramatically depending on Age and when newer updated sequels come out.  As such, it is hard to stay on top of these types of changes in the marketplace as often as they take place.  If you ever come in and feel a price is too high, PLEASE feel free to ask for a Better price, as we will almost always re-adddress a price that may have been driven down in the marketplace.

AJ's has been a very good friend when times get tough. They greet with a smile, help you work out your problems, and you leave with a smile. Thanks AJ's</review>

Ajs is literally the best pawn shop anywhere near Pomona. Everything from customer service to getting the most money for your item . They invest alot in their buildings and employees . For that same reason I keep coming back when I need to sell a item or need a loan. I've practically pawned half of my house here and have never had a bad experience. Thanks to everyone there at Ajs. And thanks Rosa for being a loyal and helpful employee at Ajs!

I used to be a very good customer here, that was until i came in one day and i had a 18KT gold chain that i was looking to sell and when i walked up to the lady at the counter she told me 15 dollars is the most they could do! $15 dollars for a 18KT gold chain didn't sound right so of course i said now and i went to another local shop and they offered me $125 dollars for the same chain. This place is just here to rip off the public do NOT go here< /text>

< Review>
I went to a few pawn shops to get quotes, then I went to AJ's.
They actually offered me more than I asked for.
I don't know what's with all the bogus reviews, the people there are all young and bought my snare drum than I probably could have even sold it for on craigslist. They helped me in my situation when I needed it, and gave me a more than fair price.
Win win.< /Review>

Awesome service!
I was treated nice, and they even remembered my name the second time I came in.
Aj's shop is so much bigger and cleaner than the other pawnshops. They actually have an inventory for sale lol.
I used to go to Sheila's pawnshop down the street, but after I went into AJ's, I could never go back.
They sell so much guitar equipment, AJ's is my new music store for me and my band mates.
I shopped around at 5 different pawn shops in Pomona and AJ's gave me the most for my broken gold rings. They were broken and they still bought it for top dollar!
Thanks AJ's!!</review>

Best smoke shop I have been to! Gorgeous glass pieces. Prices are affordable. Great selection and well organized and very friendly service. It’s also connected to a little skate shop which is cool!< /Text>

An awesome shop! I just moved to Tahoe from Mn. I checked this shop out within a couple days.  Besides the Tahoe weather and landscapes this has been my favorite experience so far.  The staff is very friendly and eager to help. They are knowledgeable of their pieces, and the artists.  Great glass selection ranging from economical to very high-end.   All very reasonably priced.  I will be back often to check out new inventory.</Text>

<Review>Haven’t been to a more unwelcoming smoke shop. Waited in line for 5minutes to buy a quick item and employees were all over the place seeing other customers/tourists before me. Didn’t even acknowledge that I was there. Ended up walking out. I was planning on making this my local but will most definitely shop down the street.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I had too many things needed to be fixed, Daniel and Norberto came on the same day I made the request. They did everything and scheduled for other things needed to be done by a third party. They are so patient clever and polite. Happy with the service they did in our apartment. .</review>

<text>My oven door was broken, Mondo and Daniel were at my home in less than 24 hours to assess the situation, they were able to get me a replacement the next day. Once I got the replacement they installed in very quickly and efficiently. Not only did they provide excellent service but they did it while respecting my home and keeping it clean. I am very satisfied. I will definitely be requesting them for any service my home needs.

We need more hard working service people like them!< /text><name>Jacob Freeman<//name>< Pictures>

<text>I really enjoy living here. The management always listens if you need help. From moving in, to any problems you may have.  The apartments are clean and the grounds are beautiful.
They have pizza and food truck nights. Holiday scavenger hunts. The Manager Virginia is always coming up with fun and new things for everyone here.
She goes out of her way to help with anything.
I would definitely recommend this apartment complex.< /text>< pictures>

I had a bee issue and Mondo from maintenance came right away to address the issue with the bee professionals . My mother is deathly allergic so I was very grateful.

My whole move-in experience at Eaves San Dimas was a good one. Hernan was extremely helpful from the moment I set up my tour appointment until after my move-in. His friendly and professional demeanor was definitely a plus. All of my questions were answered, the process was very straight forward and organized. All of this made me comfortable with moving to this property. I am definitely satisfied with this move and recommend this property and management to others.< /review>

<review>Last year we were moving from Northern Cal to Southern Cal. Not knowing what to do or where to go, My Realtor gave us three apartment complexes to go visit. The first one was Eaves San Dimas, we drove for 6 hr. to make it just after 2pm. The property was really nice we parked and was met with a smile and welcome, Monique was such a beautiful Pearson she showed us the unit and told us that if we needed to take a look at the other homes that were on our list that would be fine.
we made Eaves San Dimas our home, we have had two other managers, Ashlie and now Natasha, I asked if they seek out such beautiful people. I kid you not there has been the most warm and kind ladies I had ever known. Keep in mind I am not young lady, so I am not just making this up. As I was seeking out new communities to move because we are in need of more room Ms. Natasha communicated to me that I could go to their sister community Eaves San Dimas Canyon. Natasha called ahead and notified them I was coming. Once again they were just as nice and friendly. Well that community wasn't going to work so they suggested Eaves Phillips Ranch..
I am happy to say that we Have a new home.
Thank you Natasha for all your help in everything</review>< pics>

We transferred from another Avalon community and Hernan was very helpful and informative about the process and has been ever since. All the positive comments about Hernan are definitely true. He manages this property very courteously and professionally. All our initial service requests were addressed quickly. The maintenance staff have also been very efficient and professional. We enjoy the quiet neighborly environment. This location has been seemingly perfect because everything is nearby and we’re excited to take advantage of the events and activities in the local area. This is definitely a nice, family friendly environment that really makes us feel like we made the right choice in moving here. I noticed some negative comments about security and safety but we feel safe here with our small children knowing the police and fire station are right around the corner. Every time we’re coming home we see police vehicles driving around and it definitely gives us peace of mind.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>“Hanging by a thread”

My family and I have been living at Eaves San Dimas for 7 years now. The one main reason why we continue our residence is the phenomenal maintenance staff. Matthew, the supervisor, along with Guillermo and Junior, the technicians, are a superb maintenance team. Together they have met every request, concern, and issue with expedience and professionalism alike. If it weren’t for their unending efforts to keep us comfortable and happy, we would have left long ago.
Unfortunately, Eaves San Dimas has acquired a new team in the leasing office who we find to be unfair, and NOT child friendly. They have recently asked us to keep our children inside our apartments and keep their voices down, in the middle of summer time. We are frequently harassed by them when in swimming areas and asked to have our children be quiet while they are swimming mid afternoon.
We have multiple issues with vehicle break-ins, homeless people rummaging through dumpsters, and tenants not picking up their animal’s waste, but they continue to pressure many of us who have children, about their noise levels instead of finding proactive solutions to said issues. The sad part is that all of these new issues with the leasing office staff have just occurred in the last two to three months. Prior to that we have NEVER experienced such issues. PARENTS, BEWARE IF YOU’RE LOOKING IN TO THIS COMPLEX!</text>< Pictures>

Great experience living here! I never had any major problems, it was never too noisy, super clean site, close to shopping and anything that went wrong in the apartment was fixed same day by their onsite staff! Also Fola, the head office lady, was super great to work with and was able to go above and beyond the call of duty to help figure out ways to help out when needed!

I would recommend living here.<//review>

Submitted maintenance ticket in the early morning before I went to work for my bath knob. It was stripped and not turning off and on right. Came home from work and had a brand new knob. Same day. Two thumbs up to the maintenance crew.<//review>

<Text>Compared to the rundown property we used to live in.   San Dimas Eaves is a nice quiet property.  Clean,  Virginia assisted us through the process.  It was painless.  On line application is very convenient.  Followed up with Virginia who is very pleasant, courteous and resourceful.  She made our move-in very smooth.  My son looked at the apartment and is considering moving here as well.  I would recommend the property to anyone.  Location is very convenient.   Kudo's to Eaves.  Thank you.</Text>< time>

< Review>
I have been living here almost 1 year and I love the maintenance team. On Monday 3/28/16 Mauricio came to fix my washer and dryer. They couldn't fix it so they replaced it. Mauricio and JR worked really quick and good together. I don't know what I would do without the maintenance team. Also a few weeks ago I tripped and fell in front of the leasing office. I dropped the trash and everything flew out of my hands. I have really bad knees as well. The leasing office woman Natasha came out to help me up after she had saw what happened. She asked if I was ok, helped me up and offered to take all the trash that I was caring to the dumpster. I would definitely recommend this place!< /Review>

We love where we live! Eaves is hands down the best at what they do. We have put in a few maintenance requests and they are always prompt and professional. They do not waste time at all and simply get the job done so you don't have to worry about the little things. I sent in a request to have our dishwasher looked at because it didn't seem to be operating as it should have been and we had them come and look at it once before. Well, the very next day I get home from work to find a brand new dishwasher, owners manual, and a care package from Eaves. This and many other reasons are why we love living where we do. Mauricio the maintenance technician always does a thorough job and never leaves a mess, it was almost as if he wasn't even there!</Review>

She did everything she could for us when we moved here. From being upfront and honest for every answer to our questions, to helping us with any concerns, and to treating our dogs like they were her own. There is no bad bone in her and I applaud her for all she does at this property and others.

I have been living at the Eaves 455 E. Bonita Property for four plus years.    Fola Adeniji, The former Sales and Service Supervisor, was a very friendly, professional and extremely efficient at her job.  I looked forward to seeing her whenever I had a question about anything going on in the community.  However,  She was promoted to a new property in Corona and rightfully so.
Our new Sales and Service Supervisor, Hernan Hernandez,  has been on the property since March of this year and its been a smooth transition for myself and everyone in the Eaves community.  He is a great listener, very professional,  and always follows through on the comments people in the community leave for him.  In the short time I have known him, he has taken care of a security car parking in my spot, answered my maintenance concerns of the property, and greeted me with a smile and  professionalism each and every time. Although people in the Eaves community miss Fola dearly,  I believe we will be missing Hernan just as much when he is promoted.

The Maintenance service at Eaves has always been pretty good.  However, the new service guy, Guillermo Alva, has been the best yet. He is extremely helpful when something needs to be fixed.  I have been very happy with his work and the timely manner in which he answers my work requests.  The only thing missing on Guillermo is the cape and "S" on his chest.  If your looking for a safe and great community to live, Eaves in San Dimas is a great choice.</Review>

Amazing service! They went beyond by reserving my shoes at another store. I was a little uncomfortable because the lady was on her knees giving me my shoes and checking g my size any everything, sparking great conversations.  Didn't push me to buy other shoes or anything. She said we have to make sure we get you the most comfortable shoes that you like. Boy did she do just that! Great place, and had a great sale going on while I was there!< /text>

We had ordered shoes online and they were the wrong size.  They were excellent in helping us replace.  However, the actual retail store does not match prices you get online.  You need to reorder online to get the same price.  They'll do it for you in store and you can have shoes delivered to your  home or pick up at the store.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The wonderful ladies were patient & extremely informative with their products. I am diabetic, I have plantar fasciitis, I'm a big baby, but first of all.. my heels really hurt. The wonderful ladies worked as a team they are very professional. Their customer service is top rate. at the end I did not buy a pair of Clarks..
through their advice I found out the product line of Clarks shoes that are appropriate for me and those are the UNSTRUCTURED CLARKS product line. They only had the derby style shoes, which I'm not a fan of, I prefer the classic Oxford no lines.
I would again like to thank them for their patience and understanding. :)<//review>< pics>

<Text>I gave two stars because i love the shoes but the “manager” i believe her name is Dunia, is so rude and does know how to treat customers.  She gives awkward stares and looked at me in a weird way like i should not be in the store looking at the shoes. It is intimidating and  It made me very uncomfortable and i left. This is not the first time l felt this way. I bought a shoe not too long ago and she was there, absolutely no smile just looks irritated and seems like she hates this job. Does not make sense why clarks the most comfortable shoe store, would put some one with such manners as a manager.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This is the second Clark's we go to and get horrible/no service. Went yesterday and no one greeted us (even thou there was a guy next to the registers greeting other people as they  walked in) or asked if we would like to see anything. I walked to the back of the store and passed right in front of the register and felt ignored and while I was looking in the back part of the store an employee walked to their backroom went right by me and didn't even acknowledge me. I then walked back to the front men's section keep looking and then an employee walked right past us didn't say anything to us and asked a couple that had practically just walked in if they needed help! I'm done with Clark's! They don't seem to want my business so I will go somewhere else that does.</Review>

What's not to love? Clarks, well made shoes that feel good  when you put them on. And bonus, if you are me they will always have size 11s on hand. Usually. My main reason for marking it down to a 4 is the price. I bought a pair of tennis shoes that I desperately needed and could not find in the color and size online from their site. I was thrilled. There was a sign on the door that said, Buy One Get One 50% off. Great. While I'm there, since attractive, comfortable, well fitting shoes are hard for me, I got a second pair. Only wouldn't you know it. The BOGO did not apply to my two selections. And more frustrating, the salesman came out and said the one pair was no longer being made and that these particular style had been returned to the main site. Somehow this pair got missed. (Which explains why I couldn't find them online, ha ha) seems to me if the style is getting "tired" and old, it should be reduced. Nope 140.00. Rape for comfort. Was it worth it? Probably. If you wear average sized shoes and like to save money. I would never recommend Clark's. But if you are like me and are tired of your feet hurting, get a second job to pay for these wonderful shoes because Clark's is not in the habit of having any decent sales on the better styles, or if they do you can bet the odd sizes no longer exist...< /Review>

<review>If I could give a negative 100 star review I would. FedEx HUB in Tracy, CA Lost my sons $800 SE bike I bought for him for Christmas. For the last 3 weeks I have been given the run around and 100's of different stories on what happened to the package. I mean how do you loose a 60lb package? Answer is you don't it was stolen with in FedEx.  I am not the only one one just read the hundreds of reviews that the same has happened to. SHAME on FedEx they used to be a good company back in the day.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This place is garbage. A 2-day package has been sitting here for a week. Everyone should be fired at this facility. Terrible customer service. Lost packages everywhere. Maybe they're stealing them.<//review>

Packages that are on trailers that have not been unloaded are checked in. The customer is deceitfully notified that packages will be delivered the next day, despite the fact they are sitting in a loaded trailer, in the yard, for days on end. The customer is incorrectly notified that the delivery is scheduled and then rescheduled REPEATEDLY. The customer should not be notified of scheduled delivery until the package has physically been unloaded and scanned. FedEx has been a waste of time and money for everyone including the FedEx.

Ordered from Walmart. My items shipped from Texas to. CA in a day or 2. As soon as it said they landed at the FedEx warehouse in Tracy the delivery status has changed 3-4 times including “no delivery date.” They have been at this location for 3 weeks. We Only live about an hour away. Called to speak to Fedex and all she said was she opened up a claim and that somebody would call me back when and if they have information about my package?!?! A week later, called Walmart and they were more helpful and said my package should be here tomorrow. We shall see. After reading all the other similar reviews, it’s apparent—this place needs to get it together.<//Text>

I've had no success dealing with them trying to find my order. Very rude. Condescending. No help at all. Eventually had to re'order and file a claim through the company I originally ordered from. I hate to think this way about anybody, but I do believe that the employee ethics meter is very low at FedEx. My package is supposedly been here for over a week now. I won't be surprised if it's "lost" and have to file another claim. No accountability at FedEx.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Companies need to stop using fed ex. Their service is the absolute worst. I paid for express shipping and the package arrived in Tracy on time, and now its just sitting there. The agent I spoke to said it could take 24hrs before someone speaks with me. 24hrs. How can a company function like this?! What a waste of money, time, and product that I won't be able to use.
Update: this facility has people that are stealing your packages. I am not the only customer that has been told that their package was "lost". No, it was stolen, and this company is not holding their employees accountable! Fedex needs to do better!<//text>< rate>

Worst fedex location in history in my opinion. They have lost more packages than I can count. Does not return phone calls, everyone at the call centers know nothing, drivers write down excuses on why they can't deliver my packages that are so far fetched "inclement weather in lodi ca" on a perfectly sunny 73 degree day.
Better hope your packages don't pass through here.
So fed up<//text>

I wish companies would stop using FedEx.  They are terrible.
A company sent me a package from Utah.  It got to Tracy in 30 hours.  3 days later it's still in Tracy.  How many days does it take to deliver a package that's only 5 miles away.  Wondering how long it will be before I get it.
The Pony Express is MUCH faster than FedEx.  Lol.< /text>< UserId.>

Anyone who states the service is great is probably being paid to say that. The moment you walk in get ready to sit for two hours, while customer service pretends to look for your package. I had originally arrived because I was notified that my package was ready for pick up. If you're told your package is ready for pick up it's because it's ready for pick. Not, "give me two hours your package is some where at the warehouse". Any reasonable person can understand that. If I could I would give customers service a rating I would give it a negative 100. Dear lord that was the worst service EVER!!<//review>

The FedEx delivery driver made quote, unquote 3 attempts to my house to deliver a package. The driver made the first two attempts and only knocked on the door loud enough to hear it 5 feet away. He did not ring the doorbell! My wife was in the house both times and did not hear anything in the adjacent room to the front door.

The driver made their "third" attempt. No knock on the door, no Ring camera notification, and no door tag left behind. The door tag was signed and waiting for them to pick up. FedEx believes the driver made the third attempt after the lies the driver told them.

The customer service is very poor. I didn't get any help from them. I had to call Samsung to get the information from FedEx regarding my package. I would never ever recommend FedEx. It's unfortunate that this huge company will get away with everything they do. FedEx is probably company that will receive millions in Pandemic stimulus as well.

In short, this FedEx location has lying, dishonest drivers and customer service!<//Review>

Worst service ever. Two packages keep "arriving in Tracy" every couple days. Tried calling the number provided here only to have it say its not valid after ringing 20 times. I could have driven the hour-and-a-half to Tracy and picked up my packages instead of waiting forever and now they're apparently "lost". Will definitely make sure from now on when ordering something that it is not shipped Fed Ex.</Review>

<Text>This distribution warehouse lost my package 3 months ago and FedEx refuses to refund me my money for the lost package. As of this week they have lost another one of my packages, it has been sitting at this location for 6 days with no pending delivery date. FedEx needs to investigate this location immediately. I would give zero stars if possible.</Text>< pictures>

<text>2 of 3 packages were lost. One delivered. Second was 'delivered' but it wasn't delivered to the correct address, and my 3rd package is MIA in the disorganized chaos in the Tracy warehouse. The Tracy warehouse lost two of my shipments in October as well. Gone forever and still not resolved. This place needs a new manager.<//text>< Date>

<Review>Worst Fedex location ever. I am still waiting to receive my package, it's been at this distribution center since August 27th! I have called customer service multiple times and still nothing. I am starting to think that someone at this center stole my package.

UPDATE: Still have not received my package and it has been more then a week since my last review. So yeah. I am sure they are probably stealing packages at this distribution center.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>This is the worse FedEx location in California. They delayed packages for days without reason; they don’t answer their phone when you call to inquire about your package. If you somehow manage to get a representative on the phone after about 100 calls, they’re so rude, horrible place. This is the deadened of packages. They should be fine or shut down by the consumer affairs.< /Review><Time>1595275860790<//Time>< gmap_id>

She stated she’ll have my packet delivered by the next day, it has not come through nor has there been any changes to my tracking status.

<Review>After a package for work was stuck here for a few days we were instructed by customer service to come pick it up at the Tracy location. We drive 40 minutes and now need this package today. It’s 11 am and we have made over 30 phone calls with no answers. We called customer service again and they said they couldn’t help us. Are you kidding me? You can’t answer why our package didn’t ship and sent us over to pick it up and now no answer?

<Text>As everyone else has said this is the worst location in CA if not the USA. I have used FedEx for years previously without any issues and then  had a horrible experience to share here. I had a package from work going from Eugene OR to Modesto CA go out on 9/8/2020 and it took them until today 9/16/2020 to have it ready for pickup causing me to miss my original Monday 9/14 start date. I spent hours on the phone along with the office at work with the useless and incompetent FedEx support staff being bounced from person to person and to "supervisors" trying to see why this was taking so long as the original delivery date was to be 9/10/2020. I had to drive 33 miles each way from Modesto CA just to get my item since they could not be bothered to deliver it. I had to let them know I will call Tracy Police if they did not bring me my package before I finally got it. This facility should be formally investigated and closed down unless these people are all fired and a new staff is hired to run the facility. I will never use FedEx again myself and will recommend everyone I know to do the same. They have lost a customer for life!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

The people who work here for FedEx seem to be incompetent. We had two separate orders (1 from Amazon, 1 from LEGO) that we’re shipped through FedEx. The Amazon order was supposed to be delivered on 4/15 & the LEGO order on 4/21. However, neither of the packages have left this distribution hub. The delivery dates either get pushed back or changed to “Pending” for no reason. After filing a Claim, nothing changed. When we traveled 1.5 hours (round trip) to try to pick the packages, we waited about 2 hours (along with 5-6 other people who had undelivered packages) but were told to just keep waiting.

The SECURITY GUARDS were more helpful than the FedEx employees who work here. When I spoke to a FedEx employee who works here about the Amazon package, she told me “we found it but don’t know where it is.” 🤯 I think that says it all.<//text>

I used to work here. This is a warehouse location, and it's a very demanding physical labor job. You will need a lot of patience when working here. This is not for the slow and definitely not for the weak. And I mean seriously, if you're trying to make an easy paycheck this is not really the place for you because this is a place where you have to keep moving constantly. And if you can't keep up you will be left behind. Other than that good luck and see for yourself.<//text>

I turned in evidence to FedEx. They probably won’t do anything about it since they have no idea about what’s going on at their facility but I figure I’d post something to let people know to beware!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>I hate dealing with fedex. I hate that I have to call retailers and sellers on how they ship prior to buying product and would they be able to use other delivery services rather then fedex. They are so unreliable and unpredictable.. now I'm in a loop of there site saying delivering 6/10/2020 to wondering if they will ever deliver.< /text><GmapID>0x8090226ec8e21671:0xaec7e15e54f74e8</GmapID>< user_name>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Package was unable to deliver to my apartment for no detailed reason 2 days in a row, so I called and asked if I can pick up the end of the 2nd day and a women told me it was unable to pick up because it was in sort but she can have it held at the warhouse and I can pick up the next day, so I show up the next day at 9am and have to keep calling the people in charge of grabbing my package for me and they don’t answer for an hour then when a women finally picks up (answers with attitude) she tells me that my package is unavailable for picking because it is still in sort and cannot help me or give me a timetable. So I leave and I go on my app and request it to be held at a fedex store location close to home since they for some reason have trouble delivering to my place and now it’s just been sitting at the warehouse for 4 days and NO MOVMENT and now they DONT ANSWER ANY CALLS! So as of right now I still have not received a package that I was supposed to have a week ago for a loved ones birthday.<//Text>< pictures>

This location doesn't have a clue what they're doing. My package has been at their facility for over 2 weeks and now they are telling me to file a claim since the package is most likely lost.</Review>

<text>I was waiting for an item to be delivered on Monday.  Monday evening I checked the tracking and learned "delivery exception due to incorrect address" which meant it was not going to be delivered as scheduled.  The new delivery date was Tuesday.  Tuesday came and gone without a package.  The status update read "return to the shipper due to incorrect address."  I contacted the shipper and verified the address they had was correct.  I called the customer service and told her the address was correct.  She repeated "I am sorry for the inconvenience but the package was returned due to the incorrect address.  Please contact the shipper."  I tried to explain that nothing was wrong with the address.  But she repeated the same line at least 5 times and eventually disconnected the line.  Great.  Now I have to wait for the item to reach the shipper and they have to ship it again using other carrier.< /text>< pics>

<review>Horrible!  Two days in a row, I received status updates that said my package would be delivered "today, by the end of the day."  Each day I waited patiently, only to get another update late in the day, saying "pending".  When I called the Tracy distribution center, all I got was a lame excuse about high volume, and no promise as to when it would actually go out.<//review></record>

My package has been on their truck and out for delivery for the past 4 days. They keep taking it back to the warehouse without attempting delivery and this is not the first instance, it happens everytime with at least 2 days spent on their truck. Fedex is a huge let down< /text>

Basically your package goes on a truck at 6am .  Then the driver drives around with your package all day until 9pm. That's how next day service works.</text>

<review>Ugh so we had a scheduled delivery for 3/7 for our new bed.. it is now 3/11 and still no bed 😑. They apparently showed up 3/7 late in the evening when the apt gate was closed and instead of contacting me to open gate they left. Ok is what it is.. the next day they come again and while in the bedroom i hear the faintest knocking on the door, no doorbell, and a few mins go out and there’s a note on door saying they needed a signature and coming back tomorrow. So i sign the paper and leave it on the door for the next day.. whole day goes by and nothing. Look up tracking info and they didn’t even bother to come at all. Said they would deliver Saturday.. again wait whole day and nothing. Look up tracking info and says pending, no date for delivery.... ughhhhhhh it’s not like I’m waiting for books or a clothes or something, it’s a bed people which is kinda important thing to have ON TIME not almost a week later. So here we are sleeping on a mattress on the floor. And the best part is i had another shipment from them that was scheduled for same day that they delivered, but idk couldn’t think to consolidate time and have both my shipments on same transport?...< /review><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I called the 1-800 number and was told by customer service that it'd be rescheduled for the next day or I could drive 30 minutes away and pick it up. I drove 30 minutes away and was told by the person at the facility that they were unable to locate my package, but that it'd be delivered the next day. Still at the facility, after waiting an hour for a response, they still can't find it. So they give me the supervisors phone number to see about what I can do and I waited for 5 minutes no answer. Needless to say I will not be using FedEx by choice for anything.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x8090226ec8e21671:0xaec7e15e54f74e8</gmapID></record>

< review>
This job is very unsafe and is very complicated in terms of management u will be told so many different jobs even though u only have one in which they blame you for not doing because your so scattered from all the moving around the building and if you are young around the aw 18 or 19 they treat u like a minority< /review>

We absolutely love this small park!
In the summer they dam the creek and it makes a small swimming hole. The playground has been completely redone and it is awesome!!
They have these zip-line like swings that my kids absolutely love!! The slide is awesome!! It's a beautiful spot for a picnic too when there are not to many people there.</Text>

<text>Great location. Far enough inland to get decent heat, but not tripe digits and close enough to town to pick up supplies if you forgot/ran out of something. Also has the added perk of being far away from tweaker activity< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rate>

Nice park just redone with all handicap accessible play structure. They dam up the water in the summer to create a place to swim. It is very cold water and you have to pay to access the park.</Review>

Great little park area with a playground and a swimming pool.  Sandy beach area, picnic tables, walking paths and a floating island rafts.  Children of all ages love to go here.  It does cost $5 per vehicle.</Review>

Light and fluffy donuts. Always a nice treat for my staff! I think their prices increased. I used to be able to get 2 dozen for about $20. This time, it was $30! Gotta look for those Groupon deals next time.< /text>

I love this place.  Always very clean, customer service is friendly and helpful when selecting a variety of donuts and new donuts available.

The only set back is the parking lot is limited due to, "too" many stores in one small location.  Not Krispy Kream's fault, buy the Planning Department of Pinole didn't count enough parking spaces for how many stores on in this center.< /review>

< Review>
I don't think they make the donuts here. the ones I got didn't taste fresh and was pretty rock hard. The premium donuts that cost $1.49 more (mint with chocolate filling) looked awful with different shapes; they weren't even round! In fact they look like something from the reject pile.

The selection here is not as good as the one in Brentwood or Concord. But the staff here are really nice and friendly..< /Review>

<text>I like KKD's cause they got my favorite donuts. Although sometimes not each visit but it did happen last visit when staff keeps mentioning the savings if I bought two dozens worth. A half dozen is way too much already for me and now the pressure is on???  I politely accepted the savings. I hate myself when I always give in.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Went in at 1:30 and was almost out of everything! Only one apple fritter which tasted stale and a choice of glazed sour cream cake donut and glazed  chocolate sour cream cake. That eas literally all they had . They all tasted awful . I have never walked into a Krispy Kreme and left upset . I am rarely one to review either but this was so bad.</review>

<Review>I can't believe we just went to the Pinole California store an hour before closing and they didn't have any donuts out. We always pick up a dozen or two on our way home to
Marin county because there is not a crispy creme closer to our house. What a disappointment! We left without purchasing anything. This just isn't right. Really bad service that corporate needs to know about. Better look for a new job whoever is working at that store tonight. You don't deserve a job!</Review></record>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>I'm currently on a cut and last night I decided "YOLO... cheat day" so I checked out the Krispy Kreme website to preplan the 24 doughnuts
(Hershey's Gold, 4x Chocolate Iced Glazed, Apple Fritter, 5x Original Glazed, Glazed Raspberry Filled, Glazed Blueberry Cake, Strawberry Iced, Glazed Chocolate Cake, Cinnamon Twist, 2x Chocolate Iced Raspberry Filled, 3x Powdered Strawberry Filled, Chocolate Cruller, Powdered Blue Berry Filled and Cinnamon Bun) I was going to binge before driving 10 miles to this location. I arrived sometime around 9:40 pm( they close at 11pm) and THEY RAN OUT OF ALMOST EVERYTHING. I was able to get 1 glazed chocolate cake doughnut, the last apple fritter, and a blueberry cake doughnut. I will eventually revisit and hopefully get to try all the doughnuts off my binge list but until then here are my ratings for the doughnuts I did try.

-Blue Berry [4/10] - very artificial tasting and just meh
-Apple Fritter [6/10] - Great fluffy texture with real apple chunks but it was bitter...
-Glazed Chocolate Cake [6/10] - Thick and cakey. Very chocolatey and sweet. It was decent/acceptable.

Quite the disappointing experience overall. How do you run out of your signature flagship product....the original glaze??!?!?!??!?<//Review><name>Kevin Kwan</name></record>

Today was free doughnut day and it was a great experience. The employees were very nice and the store itself was also pleasurable to behold. Nothing about this place reminded me of the grimy local doughnut businesses I've come to love. I will keep coming here for doughnuts as long as it doesn't close down like the old one did years before.<//text>

The food was delicious and everything that we ordered was cooked perfectly. It was on the pricier side for dining in Ukiah. The service was incredibly slow and our dinner for two took more than 2 hours to get through. Our waitress checked on us only once during the meal and our water glasses remained empty for most of the main course. We also ordered drinks that were never delivered, and of course they attempted to charge us for them when the bill came due.

Overall, the experience was poor and the only saving grace was the excellent food.</text>

We were staying at The Hampton Inn next door. We figured we can easily walk over, so made reservations. We called, and left a message, and it says they will call you backin a half hour. Nobody ever did. So, we booked online.

Very nice inside. Set up is a bit odd. When you walk in, there are tables, and a guy playing a piano. The host stand is down a bit. Odd. They are usually at the door.

We were 15 minutes early, so we had to wait a few minutes. While waiting, some old guy (owner or manager?) came and shoved some papers in one of the Hostess face, yelling at her to redo this, it's all wrong. No idea what it was. But she was clearly embarrassed. He needs to learn how to treat people, and not do something like that in front of her customers and co workers. Very rude!

None of the drinks sounded great, so we got sodas. They bring bread with vinegar and oil. So good!  The bread is like soft clouds. Not enough oil and vinegar though. We asked for more.

We got the fried ravioli for an appetizer. They were good. We didn't really care for the breading too much, but still enjoyed them. Came with marinara for dipping.

I got the ribs. They were super tender. The bbq sauce was super sweet. A little too sweet for my taste. But good. The poppy seed slaw was ok. Very few poppy seeds, and not a lot of flavor. Garlic fries were good. Regular fries with a glob of garlic on top. Could be done better.

Hubby got the two lobster tails with a baked potato. He said it's the best lobster he's had in awhile. They forgot butter, so we had to ask. He asked for lemon, which he never got. They are skimpy on the potato toppings.

We also got the brussel sprouts with bacon. They were really good. A bit hard. Could be cooked longer. We took dessert to go. The butterscotch bread pudding which was so good! Yum! And the chocolate lava cake. Also super yummy.

The atmosphere was nice. Our server was nice. No smiles. She seemed stressed or overworked. Definitely tired. It's clear that management is poor here.<//Text>

<Review>I ate in the dining room for the first time and had a delicious steak cooked to a perfect medium-rare!
The atmosphere was festive and lively!
The dining room is definitely a nice option if you're not in the mood for the (also really fun) Bar/Pub side.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< date>

I've been here twice now and loved it each time! The salad bar for lunch was fabulous and the fried pickles are my favorite! I can't find them as good back home Michigan. The food here is really good and so is the atmosphere and service. I would recommend this place to anyone!</review>

My greatest disappointment though was my steak. I could have cooked it better with more flavor. I'm just unimpressed with what was on my plate for the price I paid I expected to be satisfied but I wasn't. It was just boring to my mouth. But still it's a nice setting to impress someone new. I'm never going back personally but mb others will enjoy.</Review>< Rating>

I have a crush on Crush. After a long search for Italian food outside of Lake County, I came across probably the best meatballs I've ever tasted. Gnocchi plate was tasty, a little creamy for my taste. Excellent wine menu, beautiful dining room and very intimate seating.</review>

Loved the bread, and the clam chowder oh and my roasted chicken with spinach and gravy was the best I've ever had. I'm usually too critical of restaurants but everything we had was delicious.  I'd like to try it again and see if the rest of the menu is as good.< /Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Highly overrated. I ate there with my girlfriend and we both got sick afterwards. The food was decent but they were out of a lot of their menu. The staff was kind and the food came out quickly. We were there too early for dinner so this review is only for the pub portion. I would assume the restaurant is better and hopefully they would have more options. Seems like a pretty cool place to go as a group of that is your style.</Review>< rate>

I will like to say on 1/4/2020 I went to your steakhouse and will like to say that their is great customer service and would like to say that my server Dawn and I would like her again as a waitress, she was very nice and did a great job with our table. I noticed since my last time here that the service in the restaurant has completely changed for the better &  I will come back soon..

I've been here twice, one time probably 6 months ago, and tonight. I got their Garlic bread, and Alfredo both times. Both were tasty, but I got sick tonight. Which made me realize that I got sick the first time we went there. So. Much. Garlic. I couldn't stand the smell of garlic for at least a week, to the point that I seriously thought I might have been pregnant. I love garlic, and this has never happened before. This is a long review, I just really want to stress how intense it is. So if you're going to order something I'd say stay away from the Alfredo, especially if you've already had the garlic bread. I also saw someone say that they got sick as well, but I'm not sure if it's for the same reason.<//text>

Their food was delicious and well worth the money. My girlfriend and I went for Valentine's day and I liked that they had a separate menu for the holiday. It took a while for our appetizers to arrive but I understood that it was a holiday. I gave 4 stars because I was just unclear on where and how to pay and there weren't too many alcohol beverage choices.<//Review>

Took my wife and kids here for our 6 year anniversary. Amazing dinner and was quiet and relaxing until a very large party showed up and turned into a shouting match (so loud my 3 year old was covering his ears). But we were almost done at that point. Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the noise.< /text>

The Salad Bar
Wow! You can create your own chop salad that is delicious and satifying and to-go. It was a treat in itself. My goal was to find something 'fancy' and LOW SODIUM to eat, without the 'going out to dinnner' experience- as i was passing through town and on my way home. My traveling companions had enjoyed burgers at another location. The staff was very honest about the content of salt in their entrees. My friend was driving so i ate a delicious chop salad and had a great ride home. The low sodium was the ingrediants were plant based and super fresh, sprinkle some blue cheese, crack pepper, and squeeze the lemon. That with avocado and super greens sounds good to me!<//Text>

<Review>Wine list is pretty good and features local Mendocino wines. Steaks are cooked to order and quite salacious. I had the NY strip steak  and it was delicious.  Service was good with multiple staff coming over to check on us. Very large facility with high ceilings and big booths.

Starting with our Maitre d', Eduardo, we had an amazing experience and dinner. Mom's Meatballs and Sauteed Mushrooms for appetizer sent us to heaven. The Lobster Special and Rigatoni Alla Vodka Sauce for dinner and Tiramisu for desert sent us into a happy food coma! Thank you Eduardo and Crush for an wonderful night.< /review>

Had really great salmon last week. Loved the mashed potatoes and the house salad with house dressing. Great service. Make sure and tell the waitress how you want your fish cooked. I order med rare. Perfect< /Review>

The food was honestly fantastic! The cocktails were very good as well! I had the Bison burger and my girlfriend had the Luca pizza, both masterfully cooked. The truffle fries are to die for. Pro-tip, get the green tea cocktail. The kick boxer is good to, not what you'd expect, very sour but very good.

Our server was Nate, he was so involved and helpful and also working so many tables. He definitely deserves his tips.

Anytime I come back to Ukiah, I'll be back here!<//Review>

Nothing I don't love here at Crush. Sometimes plates don't come out excatally the way I like them, however they are always more than happy to fix it "just so" the quality is always consistent. And if you are in the mood for the perfect steak thus is the place to come. I also recommend the happy hour menu. The drinks and pizzas are very good.< /review>

Definitely the best happy hour in Ukiah. Regular restaurant is also good.

Beer selection is dreadful for this region.</text>

Reserved a booth was sat at a table. They did finally get us a booth. However they did comp us 2 hors d'oeuvres because of their mistake. then ask for a soup spoon was brought a teaspoon apparently the bus boy doesn't know the difference. Asked for a medium-rare steak and got a medium steak, apparently the chef doesn't know the difference. Service was excellent though.</text>

Crush is nice but make sure you go during happy hour. The bar is great there's a fireplace and plenty of TVs with sports on. Just be sure to go during happy hour so you can get the deals on food and drinks. If not it might get a little pricey. But it is a good place to go with a large group and eat a delicious meal< /review>

I truly enjoyed the drink I ordered at Crush steakhouse. I can’t remember the name at the moment. My drink was passion fruit juice mixed with habañero infused vodka and muddled strawberries. Yum yum yum!! The meatballs were delicious too. Fun restaurant just be ready to pay above average prices.<//Text>

Ordered a med rare rib eye after seeing how good one looked at the bar. The steak I got was medium and also completely different shape and size. Wasn't trying to wait another 45 minutes for a re-fire so just  dug in, half way through I realized why I order med rare not medium. It's a Steak House so you should be sending steaks out correctly.<//Review>

It's the servers who become part of your life because they really care what's been happening.  It's the food that takes you away from all your troubles, if just for a moment.  This is the way dining out ous supposed to be.  A hearty welcome, great food, and service that pampers you every moment you're in their care.

Very nice restaurant we had a large party and there were many large parties that night service was very slow because of the crowded place but food and kindness was rated high in my opinion and we will be back.  My mom turned 75 once in a lifetime.</text>

< Review>
The restaurant is very nice.  The food is very good and during happy hour less expensive in the bar on that menu.  The samplings are generous and not all of the menu from the restaurant is available for special pricing.  The most popular items , however are worth the happy hour savings. A piano player with the music from a small grand piano will welcome you in a small Fourier.  It is very nice and the entrance opens to a beautiful restuarant.  The service in the restaurant is much better than the bar.  However, the atmosphere in one aspect may be more gentle, the bar has a fair sophistication that should warrant better service than given.  Don't lose sight of it , it is a nice bar.  Also a very nice addition to be able to walk from the Hampton outside along the pool to the gate of the restaurant parking lot.  It is a nice recommendation and one you will be glad you tried.  The holiday meals are definitely worth the reservation.</Review>

I think this is the only proper restaurant in Ukiah Lake County or Mendocino County area. The great value for the food it is a little overpriced but it is fine dining I would say it's priced accordingly. And the servers are always so friendly and everybody is sonali. Definitely recommend but make sure to make a reservation between Thursday night and Sunday night</Review>

<rating>4</rating><Review>This is a upscale restaurant with a full bar and a good selection on the menu which is updated regularly to reflect seasonal foods. This is a great place for groups and family dinners, and has a separate bar where you can grab a quick bite or enjoy a good pizza and beer. Not a place for a romantic dinner for it tends to be on the noisy side and can be hard to have a  conversation. This is Ukiah s steakhouse.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808164443624b739:0x758ef0dae2e2f749<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Ordered steak and it was not very lean.  There are surprisingly very few Italian options so this really qualifies as a steak place with some pasta dishes.  Service was good but the wine is so overpriced.  $15 for a glass of Decoy when you can buy a bottle of it from Safeway for $20.  Not sure why restaurants do this.</Text><userid>114733646420006453271< /userid><user_name>Jim Flood< /user_name>< Response>

<review>Pass by all the time, friends said it was excellent. Not sure if off night (Friday) or what but everything was just off center. Under fried appetizer, (which was comped without us having to say a word, thank you Crush for giving your attentive servers some decision making power), Luke warm mash with her filet, too much garlic with my fish sides, etc.. might be back for a drink or appetizer but dinner probably not.< /review></record>

Absolutely the best food around. Pricey but worth it. Bartender added mint to my drink (muddled it) after I said I didn't want ANY mint. Was reluctant to remake my drink. However the drink was very good after he remade it. Staff was very friendly.</Text>

<Review>We heard a lot of reputation friends so we decided to give it a try first when we came in the host was so nice and helpful even though we already have a reservation but still 10 mins wait. When we lead to our table just realized that our server kinda cold and not making the eye contact that not a good sign so turned out it took her almost half an hour to get our order. The food was OK tnot something magnificent for the price you got to pay. Not going back.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1550349705338, 'text': 'Hello Apple.

Happy hour from 4-6pm pretty good. Specials from $5 to $10 in drinks, plates, and shareable appetizers. They serve big brand beers, as well as a couple Mendocino Brewing Co options. Although they have their own parking lot and people can also park on the street, it gets full.</Review>

After reading A lot of bad reviews about how it took so long to receive service and their food- we are skeptical about going. But after eating there everything was amazing, the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Food was great, a little pricey for us, but it was a special occasion so it didn't matter  it didn't take too long to get to our table we were seated at 7:30, got our main course at 8:00. We will definitely be comming back to eat again. Give them a try even tho some people wrote bad reviews.< /review>

<Review>Great Food!  The wood fire pizzas are amazing.  Nice bar with great Bartender's that know how to pour.  Crush offers a great Happy Hour discount on Food & Drinks from 3 - 6 every day of the week which is great for all of the Happy Hour Seekers out there.  Recommend highly wether you're a local or traveling through like I was.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Some of the best food in Ukiah. Both the bar and main restaurant are great. Main restaurant can be a little pricey, but it's worth it. The bar is pretty comfortable even though it can get very noisy. I love happy hour. Drinks are mixed well and food never disappoints. Favorites include: frickels, wings, and steak nachos but, the freaking GARLIC BREAD is life changing.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Okay good food, and service. However,  I'm giving this place a 4 star rating  because I was shocked when I saw brown heroine in a powder form, from a capsule in the ladies restroom.  I took a picture of it because I thought it was absolutely disgusting< /text>< Rate>

I'll be honest, I've eaten at Crush four times in a row before. It's really good food. The wait staff is energetic and always smiling. The bar is well-stocked and caries plenty of local beer. If you're staying in the hotels nearby, Crush is a no-brainer. If you're travelling through town and need a place to eat, stop by the bar. There's also a nicer, steakhouse-style portion of the place but I'm usually in it for the sports on TV and the pub atmosphere.< /Text>

Decent food, good cocktails. I feel the food is overpriced relative to the quality. Frito misto is mostly onion rings but they charge more than I have paid at nice resturants in the bay. Pizza is very greasy. The best items are the steaks, but again given the price I'd expect better. The atmosphere is whete they earn a couple stars with me. Well decorated and spacious dinning area.<//review>

Drinks weren't good, unless you get wine. Penne Pesto was excellent.  I have had a better steak at Waffle House that wasn't $35. Expensive and bland with ripped booth seats.<//Text>

Waited over 40 minutes after placing an order for fish tacos. Only was served after I grabbed a waiter to ask about my food. Food came out a couple minutes later - cold food on a warm plate. Waitress gave a half-assed "the kitchen is so busy" - my food was cold. The kitchen wasn't the problem. The inattentive waitress was the problem. Couldn't tell you if the food is any good because I'm not eating fish that has been sitting 30-40 minutes. Don't go unless you enjoy long waits watching other people eat.< /review>

This place is absolutely Amazing!! Grew up in Chico, that's where it originated, so happy they're in Ukiah! 💗 To have one close to where I live now makes me feel closer to home. Sad part, bartender that helped us is leaving and he made me the best Lemon Drop I've ever had, did I mention I lived in Chico? I've had a few Lemon Drops. Big enough portions you could split a app, main, and a dessert and have a great date! Great atmosphere!! Super happy, everytime we're in Ukiah for shopping we will be stopping here. Waiter we had wasn't horrible, wasnt great, you could tell he's been at this gig awhile and he thinks he knows what he can get away with. Extremely happy with food and drinks!!</Review>

Took almost an hour to finally get our appetizers, which were pickles and wings. The wings were ice cold, didn't even touch them.

Took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks too, poor service.

Granted it was Veterans day, but there was only two waitresses, they were understaffed on a holiday.

Possibly the worst pub experience I've had in my life.

Probably won't be coming back.<//Review>

Update - this place completely turned around. I've eaten here 2 times with a large group and all food was great! Great job guys!

I decided to go back after 2 years, the last time was terrible. This time? Terrible again! Filet was terrible - practically dog meat - and garnished with a garlic clove? Disgusting. If you can't cook a filet you shouldn't call yourself a steakhouse. I'll never go here again. I gave 2 stars because the apps were pleasant.< /Text>

I enjoy the pasta here and was served a wonderful Cioppino, however the last two times I ordered a steak from this restaurant my request for a medium rare steak was botched. Last night I was served a black and blue steak with cold mashed potatoes. I paid $30 for a rib eye at a steak house and was served a farce.<//text>

The last 2 times we are there we were thoroughly unimpressed, which is not good for the price.

< review>
Had an excellent dinner tonight with three friends at Crush.  Our server, Dawn was both cordial and professional.  She paced our meal perfectly so just as we were finishing the appetizer and salads, she and another staff delivered four freshly prepared plates of delicious jumbo shrimp scampi,  chicken alfredo, chicken picata, and chicken parmesan.  Each was expertly plated and piping hot from the kitchen.
The wine list is ample and offered various vintages from local wineries as well as some from other locales.
We usually just hit the pub for dark beer and  fish & chips, but I highly recommend sitting down for a full meal to appreciate the real quality available at this location.</review>

Been there three times, and every time the food is mediocre. The third time I went the waitress was extremely rude and my girlfriend and I ended up leaving before we even got our food. Do not waste your time or money on this restaurant.</Text>

<Text>We happened upon this restaurant while passing through Ukiah.  The food, service, and atmosphere were amazing.  I wanted steak and ordered the ribeye.  It was tender, flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection!  The sautéed mushrooms were absolutely the best I have ever had.  The truffle oil was the perfect touch.   My wife had the pasta Bolognese and it was awesome as well. We only regret that we were too full to have dessert!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Once again, Crush fails to deliver a decent dinner for my wife and myself.  My wife had the Ribeye, with a loaded baked potatoe which was more sour cream than potatoe, and a salad.  Her steak, which she wanted medium well, was rare and instead of a char on it they burnt one side of it which they tried to hide by putting it on the bottom side.  More than half the steak was fat, and her six prawns were also Burt and tough.  Definitely not worth $50 it cost.  I had the New York and a lobster tail, with truffle fries, and the house Clam Chowder.  My steak which I ordered Med. Rare, was half rare, and half medium.  The lobster was very small, tough,  and very fishy tasting.  My chowder was served cold and not worth $8.  I used to have great food at Crush, but it seems that the "Ukiah curse" has taken this place over.  Ukiah's restaurants when open are good for a year to maybe two, but eventually their food, service, atmosphere just take a nose dive after that period.  I give two stars.  One because my wife enjoyed her salad, and their bread with balsamic dip is still delicious.  I do feel bad because they have lost my business, but for what we were served for $165 was absolutely pathetic and disheartening.  Maybe one day Ukiah will provide us with a restaurant that is consistent and enjoyable.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1538195134975< /Time><userid>108574857750367088584<//userid><Name>Ryan Kirkpatrick<//Name>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>I did not make reservations so they sat us in the bar area. The bar area was so loud with the sounds of people that it gave me flashbacks of a military dining facility/messhall. I ordered a ribeye steak and my wife ordered the salad bar. My order came out before my wife could come back to our table from the salad bar. The chef found it necessary to pour some kind of nasty tasting sauce on my steak. My steak came with a baked potato. I asked for a "loaded" baked potato. When I looked at it it had a tablespoon of sour cream and light sprinkling of bacon on it ..... for 3 dollars. No vegetables were offered with this dinner nor served although for 3 dollars more I could have had them. The steak was over priced as is this entire menu. This was not a good dining experience for the wife and my anniversary. We will not be going back to this over priced, noisy, place to dine.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I experienced Crush as a patron of a group of people, a banquet per say.
The items came out one at a time.
*Salad was beautiful and tasty
*Penne cream of pesto pasta coldish
*Chicken parmesan cold, VERY dry
*Steak (top round or London broil) was VERY VERY rare (which I love) but my grand children and the rest of the table did not
*Took forever and a day to get our order in for our beverage then another day and a half for them to arrive lol
All in all good vibe, good staff but THE TIMING AND SUCH MUST FIND IMPROVEMENT</Text>

The food was great and perfectly cooked, and our waiter Charles, and the buss boy were both great. Liked the look of the place to. Why only 4 stars then.. well, the lighting is very low, making it very hard to read the menu. 2nd I perfer my dinner to come with vegies, and/or salad, or soup opion.. you gotta pay more. It adds up very fast!!!  16oz rib eye $34 only comes with mash potatoes,  you can sub loaded baked or some kind of fries for $3. There are add on for more money. You can add half an order of vegies for $4.50 more.. granted vegies are things like asparagus, Brussels sprouts, saute mushrooms..  and half an order of the saute mushrooms was way bigger then I thought it would have been. Scrimshaw was $11 my guy said... wow a local beer and that high! But all in all we were very happy we gave it a try, and we will try it again....< /review>

The food was great, and for those who drink, a good quantity of liquor.< /Review>

Service was good, but too fast, with appetizer and dessert, took only 45 minutes, must have been prepared ahead, creme brule was cold, daughter threw up in parking lot.  When I went back in, rude chef said brule is "supposed to be served cold"!</Text>

< Review>
We are from out of town and looking for somewhere to watch the warrior game and have a drink and a bite to eat.  The service was lacking in every aspect as the food at CRUSH was equally pathetic!!!! My partner and I have NEVER POSTED ANYTHING NEGATIVE UNTIL here, today. The ribs we ordered were nasty as well as the shoestring fries.  Neither one of is ate 1/2 a rib and the OVERWHELMED AND incompetent waiter never even cared enough to slow down enough to notice.  TWO THUMBS DOWN<//Review>

<Review>20 people, with reservations made. 2/3 of our party early or on time. 5 minute wait. Asked for childs menu while making reservation, yes they said. No childs menu. 5 minute wait for water. Only half of party given water. Drinks ordered. 50 minutes later drinks arrived.
Food ordered 40 minutes and food portions all over the board. Twice as much food on one plate as the same item ordered by another in the party sitting next to each other. No coffee offered and the manager when asked to speak to you, never came out. Coward.
Horrible, inconsistent. Oh and the hostess...the tops of her nipples were showing over the top of her clubbing dress.
And this was during sunday brunch. And we were the first table....bad management.</Review>< pics>

<text>No service.  My wife and I stopped and decided to eat at the sports bar.  Upon entering we were told to sit anywhere so we sat at a table for two.  The bus boy brought us water almost imeadiately.  Then we sat and waited, and waited.  The restaurant was maybe half full with many wait staff.  Each waiter/waitress walked by us several times and no one brought us a menu.  After about 15 minutes of waiting and trying to get someone's attention with no responce we got up and left.  We were even thanked for coming in.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating><response>None</response><Name>Robert Abernathy<//Name>< gmapID>

Food was pretty good and has been all 3 of the times I've been here, the service however was sorely lacking. I saw the beer I ordered sitting on the bar for 10 minutes!  Wth!? Then the waiter brought it to me immediately before the food, he then ignored me the rest of the time. Pfft, I didn't realize I was invisible.</Review>

It's OK. Not a big fan of it. The food is over priced. I feel like they try too hard to make the meals different and it doesn't work.<//Review>

< review>
These guys are completely incompetentry from the ground up from the waitress to cooks to the manager...I live right around the corner and get food here all the time...they have messed up my to go order EVERY SINGLE time..to the point where the manager is tired of seeing Mr complain .  Make sure you check your order before you leave with it bc I garun tee it wrong. And after the 5th time of this the manager didn't offer me a free meal, a desert , a gift card or nothing..lame,lame , and more lame..learn how to run a resturaunt..<//review>
