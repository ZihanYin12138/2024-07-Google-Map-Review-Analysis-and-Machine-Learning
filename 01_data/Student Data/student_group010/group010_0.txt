<Review>Sorry if this is a little long but this shop is fantastic.  MY cell phone went dead and I had insurance on it, but with a deductible. I went thru 3 days of  phone calls and run around with them trying to get them  to replace the battery and see if  that fixed the issue (this would be free under my  plan).    No all they would do was send me a refurbished replacement phone, after I paid the $200 deductible and sent them my broken phone.  They could not say what kind of phone it  would be.  I like my old  phone and did not want to change it, but I was stuck unless I wanted to fork out $800-$1200 for  a new phone.  I found Love 2 Fix on line and went into the shop.
Immediately upon talking to Chris I felt better and knew I had found a better solution and felt much better.  Everyone in the shop was professional and very helpful.  Chris was super knowledgeable not only about phones and electronics but also about the insurance companies for these cell phone carriers.  Once my phone was fixed (for less than my deductible) my cell phone carrier started having trouble activating it back onto my account.  I went back into Love 2 Fix and Eric helped me call into the cell company, get a real person on the phone, provided me with all the crazy numbers off my phone that the cell phone guy kept asking for.  The process took a long time and Eric stayed at least a half hour after he was supposed to get off just to make sure I could get the phone activated properly.
So just to summarize, the employees and work done by everyone at Love 2 Fix was awesome and greatly appreciated by me.  After years of paying into an insurance plan, all they would do was charge me a deductible just to send me a refurbished phone.  In the future rather than pay $20-$40 a month for phone insurance I will just put away a few dollars when I can and if I have an issue I will just take it in to Love 2 Fix.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1616424909269, 'text': "Great to hear from you, Archie, and thanks for the perfect review!

The owner of Love 2 Fix is amazing. I had my phone fixed at another phone repair shop in Arden Mall called Custom cases and the phone screen they replaced my phone with was defective. The screen completely turned black within two and half weeks later. When I went back into the Arden store they said that I would have to pay for a another replacement. Although it clearly states on their vendor policy as well and the store policy that there is a warranty but Custom Cases defense was that it isn't covered because it has physical damage.( mind you my phone had no physical damage they just claimed that it was). Warranty does not cover the phone screen if  there is physical damage. I went home and called other repair shops and Love2fix was the most helpful. The owner Chris went out of his way to diagnose my phone as well as guiding me for facts to take back to the Arden store. He diagnosed my phone with no physical damage and I was able to take it back and have it replaced with a higher quality screen for free. Chris had no obligation to help me but he did anyway. Not only did he diagnose my phone but he also wrote a statement of fact to take back to the other store to have my phone fixed under warranty for free. He was kind and helpful and I am extremely grateful.</Review>

Those people coming from other planet so long story short  don't waste your money or your time or something that to fix. Please before you visit this place Go check the other reviews which is one 🌟 the same victim like me. There's a lot of places with great job respectful reception & reasonable price. But this place don't do it. I wonder how they get it that ****  star.< /review>

STOP! Don't go here!!!! I am giving you a warning so I don't have to say "told you so."  High prices are off set by poor craftsmanship, bad customer service and dishonesty.  If what you need is slow service, broken promises, lies and buck passing. then, by all means, deal with these guys.
But if you want service with a smile, fair up front pricing, honesty and timeliness then  go anywhere but here. There are lots of places around. Don't let them low ball you to get you in as they did me. But now that I have been in....my advice is RUN!!!< /Review>

These guys are the best! I was so impressed by the price, quality and great customer service in this place! My kiddos always take my phone therefore repairing cracked screen is nothing new to me. This time I went in because my daughter dropped my phone and it was not displaying anything, plus the screen was cracked. I went to few other places before where I was charge unreasonable amount of money for repair and for a cheap plastic screen protector, I hated it ! Here my great experience started when I called there. The owner/manager was so helpful, he gave me a quote that was very reasonable and said it could be fixed in 30 min. When I got there everyone was so chill and nice. You can tell they have pros working there )) they fixed my phone in no time. I walked out with brand new looking phone. I was very happy and would recommend them to everyone! Good job guy! Keep up the good work !< /text>

{'time': 1608602983930, 'text': "I am glad that you copied and pasted your review so we could copy and paste out reply.\n\nI would just like to say that you leaving a review like this is absolutely childish and full of misinformation.\n\nThere is no such hold on our account for accepting payments, but there is an issue with certain zip-codes that happen from time to time, but we work with eBay to see what those are and will still offer to sell out items to customers who want to reach out to us outside of eBay like you did. You wanted the multi-pack of screen protectors for your older phone and were offered two forms of shipping. The first would be free per the eBay posting and consists of a bubble mailer that we put postage on and drop in the mail. This first option has no tracking available as it has stamps on it and is dropped off with the normal mail. The second option was going to be a priority mail flat rate box with USPS or a fed-ex express shipment which would have a tracking number as well as 2 day expedited shipping. You were notified of the two options up front and went with the cheapest option, understandable in your case.. With all the problems that USPS is having with their mail centers and the sorting issues we cannot guarantee the estimated shipping times that they give us since there is nothing we control about the shipment aside from getting it in the mail that same day as purchase.\n\nFor you to refuse to upgrade for tracking and then imply that there should be one by default when our original agreement did not include one is very irresponsible as you are attempting to mislead other consumers with the greatly exaggerated and unfair review. Also using threats of reviews like that to try and get your demands makes you seem untrustworthy to start with.\n\nWe try to make everything as clear as possible up front with our sales and services, but when you fail to understand/comprehend or don't like the outcome from your choices, don't try to point the blame away from yourself. Happy holidays and look forward to USPS delivering whenever they feel like it. :)"}< /resp>

When a patient go to the doctor and say I have stomachache ! Doctor just give a medicine to stomach or see carefully and then give medication?
For this store if I want to rate  absolutely I’ll give 0 ! Because when I said my camera is broken they change the lens when I see it didn’t change they told me it’s damaged and need new one! they said me after change the lens and waste my money 😕they told me you said change lens but I’d never said just change the lens I said my camera is broken!???? So why do they take device passcode when they just change the lens ? They waste my time and  money !< /Text>

We noticed upon opening the device that there was signs that liquid had been inside the device. We replaced the lens for you because that was what you had requested initially. When you came back we notified you that the camera was damaged in addition to the lens that was damaged. You were given the price for camera replacment in addition to lens and then you started to insist that we fix "the whole thing" and that we work with you on this.  My manager on site at the time offered you a discount on a combination of lens and camera replacment and gave you a few options on what we could do to take care of you since it was after closing when you decided to try and discuss different services. You were refusing what we were offering so we also gave the option to reverse the work that was done and refund you minus the shop minimum for the time spent repairing and returning the device to it\'s original condition.  We tested your device and got the work done so it could be picked up as soon as possible for you, you decided to change what we had discussed over the phone earlier in the day after we had completed the work you requested. If you had specified up front that the whole camera had issues as opposed to just the glass ypu would have been quoted and entirely different process for repair. We could have gotten the repair done for you all together, but you were trying to insist that we repair the whole device for less than half of one repair. If you would like to get the device serviced in the future feel free to call us again or send a message with the full details of the device and we can get an accurate quote of what the repair would cost.'}</resp><gmapID>0x809adc209b732dbd:0x544827a4975d768a</gmapID></record>

<Text>Not recommending this location. They’re scammers, rip customers off. They didn’t fix my device ripped me off and my friend as well. If you take a device for battery issues or any other issue they will point out another device problem for you trying to professionally rip you off and will charge you more. Please read all reviews you will find out about their game. They will write two pages response after someone give review. Check it out.< /Text>< pics>

My responses are based on factual information so everyone can have context because were a small business there are no robots to say sorry or thank you. Not a game as you say. Your name doesn't match your ticket but I just realized your the very impatient yoga customer demanding the battery be the only issue, We rigorously tested that device and found the battery to not be the only fault. Your upset that we warned you it would not be a same day service if so and that it would take some time to look at since our queue was quite full. I know you had already set a ticket with the device to send it to Lenovo but unfortunately we did let you know we may need to take some time to find a alternative way to get the device to boot. I know you had information you needed off that laptop urgently as you stated so clearly. But trying to charge the battery as you demanded did not work as the clear issue was the Motherboard of the yoga. We notified you as soon as all options for your time frame were exhausted. You can call us scammers all you would like but when we lay our a clear expectation and you dont listen to those recommendations and try to demand another outcome that wont change what is and isnt correct. Personally I checked that device over with a fine tooth comb until the problem was found and you were just not having any explanation then what you thought was correct. Apologies but tried it your way and that didn't work. When i notified you of the alternatives you demanded to pick it up and when you got here still for some reason questioned why it was not fixed or charged for you to retrieve your data. When there were 3 clear conversations about the options outcomes and all present information was given to you. Lastly not sure who this friend of yours is but if they have any issues whatsoever as everyone has the right to they can contact me directly and ill make it right. On this one sir you are very much on the side of disregarding the information of a decades long experience for no reason other then to satisfy your own anger at the manufacturers defect you experienced.

I came across there phone sales on offer up. I am a nurse and needed a temporary phone to use for a month. I went to the shop bought the phone, within the next day the screen was not working. I took it multiple times to get fixed they said the screen was fine. Once again I went in I had cracked the screen paid more for them to fix it due to the screen already having issues. They told me I could possibly switch phone out for another phone. I drove to carmichael over six times and phone was never fixed. There technician was out of town for days before letting me know any updates on phone. I'm going The owner Christian got on the phone stated "I'm not going to be playing games" if you want it fixed pay another 100 after paying 160 for a iPhone 6 plus. Then he hung the phone up in my face. I would have just picked up the phone and bought a new one or paid extra for a different one. I've never met a owner with such bad representation of his buisness. I recommend going to smart shop, and I recommend we give buisness to good respectful human beings.< /text>

<review>These guys are amazing! My phone that I use for my business abruptly died. I called a couple of other places and they said they could not get the part. A friend of mine referred them to me and I took my phone in and they told me it would be a couple of days to get the parts I needed. Lo and behold they called me the next day and told me my phone was ready! They were able to tack on my part to an overnight order they already had. These guys are awesome and I would recommend them to everyone I know.< /review><UserId.>115096324694585021467<//UserId.>< resp>

Don't generally leave reviews, but this place definitely deserves two thumbs up. One for excellent service, and one for excellent customer service. Talked to Chris, who was super knowledgeable and super friendly. They are a little bit on the pricey side, but it IS WORTH THE MONEY! They do excellent work, and get it done quick.</text>

L-O-V-E this shop!  Beat out 2 other shops by far.  My problem: new phone, no techy skills and nobody to help.  They corrected what the salesperson did wrong.  Got my phone up and running and ready to go.  What normally takes me 3 weeks of errors and loss of sanity they had my phone ready in an afternoon.  They are super!  Highly recommend them.  I'm VERY happy with their work!👍</review>

<Review>Chris and his team at Love 2 fix had my phone fixed WAY quicker than I expected this time. I always come here and refer people because it's so hard to find a good go to person for phones and electronics. So many fly by night people in this industry it's hard to know who to trust, but these guys will have your back<//Review>< Rate>

<response>{'time': 1602197257925, 'text': "Our initial estimate for repairing your PS4 was around $100 due to the issues you described when you first came in. What you failed to realize is that was an estimate based sole on your description before our findings. Turns out Your son had spilled milk on the device and insisted that none had gotten inside-- nonetheless, we needed to open up the device to see if this was actually the case. Our policy for liquid damaged devices is to charge up front $59.99 for the board wash so we and our customers can be completely certain there isn't any lingering liquid or corrosion after the repair. In our initial testing, we found it was overheating and would consistently crash after just a few minutes at the main menu. Upon opening the device we discovered that milk had indeed gotten in the unit and on the board. We immediately reached out to you with this information and you approved the board wash and deep cleaning service at $59.99. Which today you declined you ever spoke with us so we pulled the logs and confirmed times and dates with you. Weird. With units that are this damaged there is a lot of work that needs to be done to them to even get to the point of fully assessing them to make sure they fully function. You brought the unit in for power issues and running slowly but throughout our testing we found your PS4 had board damage, power supply issues, a failing hard drive, a jammed fan and a very dusty heat sink. We gave you the new quote for the repairs and you understandably wished to cancel the repair. We undid all the work we did and were just going to charge you the remaining $20 balance for the board wash service which you had approved and was already completed. This did not even include the almost 10 hours of labor that went into the testing and work that we put into the unit. We did not release the PS4 to you because you wanted to argue the pricing of a service that we had done with your approval. Also demanded more money back because we followed our timeline with liquid damage and told you it could take some time. You called the police expecting them to honor your demands after you protested and stated you wouldn't leave, We allowed this childish behavior and let you cool off, after which you called the police and unfortunately as you even stated The police came in to hear both sides of the argument and to explain the situation to you. We would have 100% returned your PS4 to you without you calling the police had you paid the remaining balance. Sorry that it came to that but when a customer agrees to a price and is told of all aspects of what we are doing then we hold them to the same standard we are held to. From that point on that becomes your responsibility to follow through while we had done the same. Apologies for the delay in the quotes but with that severe of damage and milk it took quite the time to figure everything out. Glad you finally paid the balance and got your device, You device is now free from all milk and in working standard up to the hard drive that needs replacement. Feel free to watch some youtube videos on replacements and attempt the repair at home so you can save some of the money. I know that was a concern. Luckily that repair is a 3 out of 10 on the ifixit scale for difficulty. Hope that clears up any misinformation in your day and in the future. Have a great day Saleh!"}<//response><UserId.>102834166936613006792</UserId.><review>They are lier what they say don’t do that. They told me to fix my ps4 in couple days but it took more than two weeks. Finally they unable to figure out the problem and despite that they charged me extra money for cleaning which was not necessary. I found these people corrupt and not fully expert in their field. They they did not want to release my ps4 back to me as I was not paying them for the extra charges, then I called police and with the help of police I got back my ps4 from them. So please be aware of this corrupt business.< /review><Date>1602192175478< /Date></record>

Let me just start off by saying: This place is the best!
Brought in my phone, for a screen repair, and they fixed it right up, good as new, and super quick!
Came back in because I dropped my phone, in a puddle on a rainy day (the same phone), which cracked the screen. They took it in for a board wash and screen replacement, to remove all water from the device, but got it back sooner than expected, and it works good as new. These guys are lifesavers!! The employees are super knowledgeable and friendly. Never going to anyone else, EVER again!
This place rocks!<//review>

I went today to that store to fix my iPhone 7 Plus, first thing they charge me $32 to do diagnose defined out what’s wrong, then they told me it need to be bored wash they charge me another $33 The total became $65 and They told me will be ready same day or next day, then I called by the end of the day they told me is better for you to buy a new phone , because you need a new motherboard or they have to delete all data and cost more than phone worth which is there’s a boss to say that after the diagnosed , And they didn’t refund me anything. This store rip me off. just be careful when you go to the store . I wish I could give them negative stars.< /text>

Quick, Easy Done.
Got my phone fixed here for a charging issue. Tried cleaning it out myself and busted my charge port. Erik took the time to check it out, and let me know I busted my charge port. Little sad that I broke it myself, so definitely my fault, but Erik explained how everything would work, how long it would take, fees associated with it, and the whole 9 yards. Never been happier with the customer service and the speedy service provided. Two thumbs up for sure!</Text>

<review>I have been to Love 2 fix before and they helped me out last time with my iPhone 6 battery. This time I dropped my phone in the sink so I called them to see if they could help me! They told me to power the phone off and bring it in as soon as possible so I raced over because they told me it was important to get it in as soon as possible. I got in and they told me it was $59.99 to do a board wash and diagnostic on it to see if there was any damage to my phone. After a little over an hour I get a call that they washed the phone and were checking to be sure that the phone was fine. I got a call back later that the phone was fine because I got it in so fast. If you get your phone wet DO NOT WAIT! Take it to Love 2 Fix while it isn't too late!</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Poor costumer service skills among the employees. My hubs found this place when I busted my screen. Was quoted less than 100 to fix it(on the phone). But when we brought it in person it was over 100 so we left the store. Like 10 -15 mins later my hubs, got a phone call. Saying the that the one employee had misunderstood. I think that costumer shouldn't be the one to suffer because of the employee's lack of communication skills. We went back for what we were quoted which was less than $100.

Update: They weren't even able to fix my damaged phone. They gave us a full refund, which is very much appreciated! 😁</review>< user_id>

<review>Brought my iPad in because i dropped it in a puddle. Didn't know any good tech repair shops in town, so I got referred from a friend, who told me they did exceptional work. Spoke to Erik, and told me they would have to do a "boardwash" to remove all the liquid from the device to try and save it. He also gave me a rundown of what the next steps would be, and he reassured me, that my device was in good hands. Came back to pick up, and works good as new. This is by far, my favorite repair shop, and they'll fix anything with a power button.  Definitely coming back here for all my electronic repairs!</review></record></dataset><record>

I bought a used iPhone 7 here as a final sale with no returns. I brought it back because the phone was running very slowly and I wanted to see if they could do something to help me out. They told me that they could not give me my money back, but they helped me go through all the settings and make sure that everything was alright on the phone. It turns out that battery saver was turned on and it runs much better. I was upset at the start, but now I am leaving very satisfied.</Review>

Busted my iPhone screen, and they got it done in 30 mins. Now my phone looks good as new. Could not be happier.
Came back the next day because my buddy dropped his iPhone, and low and behold, 30 mins later, it looked good as new. Buddy was happy, and I am definitely coming back for my next screen fix.

I spoke to Clayton on the phone last week to ask some questions about getting my computer fixed up because I think it had a bug in it. I did not know what information he needed off of the computer so he offered to find it for me if I brought it in for him to look at (I am technology dumb). The front desk person checked my computer in and Clayton looked at it. I had a ton of junk files and programs because of all the emails I had opened up. He was so nice and helped set up windows defender for me and gave me a checklist on what to look out for in an email to see if it was bad. Very good experience</Review>

Computer purchased from them crashed and owner and manager took no responsibility and would not give money back. No effort made by owner to contact me.</Review>
<pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1597210483813, 'text': "Wrong, Considering myself the Owner/Operator Told you as you came in i had to step out. I was stuck in a Mandatory Zoom meeting for 2 hours so apologies but that's just the facts. Erik my manager tried to help you with information about the store policy and policy your husband agreed to when purchasing the Used laptop instead of fixing his previous one he broke in a oddly similar way in the end of June. You were very rude threatening and near belligerent to him for no reason. I Told him just to stop service and refuse any further work on the device after your scene.\n\nThe facts are he was told there was a 30 day Support and Return policy on This laptop as a courtesy. He was made aware at the time of purchase about extending that coverage against breakage and software related damage through squaretrade. He declined the offer. He was in a hurry to get a working unit quickly so i can understand the haste he was in. Still he could have changed his mind within the typical 7 day Used item warranty as spoken about and let us know. Today he brings in the laptop near 40 days after the purchase to let us know the system has crashed. Upon first inspection we find the units operating system will not load. Indicative of a software problem either with windows updates or something that may have been downloaded incorrectly but still not a hardware failure from first glance, we notify him he is not under warranty due to date and type of failure and would have to pay for a diagnostic and we will get to it by tomorrow. Before the end of the day you come in and created the lovely atmosphere we then had making threats and screaming with other customers in the lobby.\nSo we have decided to refuse service and immediately processed your refund for the diagnostic.\n\nThis is not how i like to do business but with your actions today of which i am shocked. Even after Erik at your request gave you the breakdown of all items you've had serviced with us in the past and all individual charges made by yourself and your husband not including the laptop just so you could demand a refund for all monies spent with us . Sadly that is not an option. Especially since the laptop was a purchase explicitly sold as is and in working condition at the date of sale. Not to mention all consignment items are typically 7 day warranties but i extended his due to his need of a data recovery on the old laptop and transfer to this one in his haste. I made sure all his information was on the laptop and even reloaded it due to a mistake on my techs part of only loading 98% of the recoverable data. So i had them restart the 20 Hour process free of charge. Ask your husband im sure he remembers having to come back to retrieve the laptop due to that error. Apologies.\n\nAt this time I regret to inform you we will not offer any service for your devices in the future I would kindly ask you seek help from a different small business.\n\nI truly hope you get whatever current or future issues you need fixed resolved but as it stands we will no longer be able to help you.\n\nHave a great day"}< /resp>< GmapID>

My computer was running very slowly and I was getting tons of really weird popups on my desktop. I took it in to Love 2 Fix and Jason checked it in. He told me that it would take a few hours, but that I would hear about an update by end of day. I called the next morning after they opened to get an update because I thought they forgot about me, but my voicemail box was full so they could not leave a message. Oops! I had some viruses and a "Ransomware" that was trying to access and lockout my computer! They ran a tuneup and virus removal and the computer seems the be doing better now.< /review>

Amazing service, great products! They were able to get my water logged phone back to life! I was so glad to be down the road from them.

Love 2 Fix has low prices for awesome service. I would recommend these guys to anyone who has any technology issues.

I dropped my iPhone and the screen went blank and I was so worried that all my data was gone! No matter what I did my phone would not turn on! I messaged a couple people on facebook and the fastest person to get back to me was Jack and that he worked at this shop in Carmichael. He told me to bring the phone in and that they could take a quick look at it. When I got in they messed around with my phone and pointed out that the phone still vibrated and buzzed when you pushed the buttons and that was a good sign. They had me check in my phone because they were busy (it was a friday night) and that they would call me by end of business with an update. I got a call about an hour later that they tested the phone with a new screen and everything was fine!!! They said that my diagnostic fee of 29.99 could go towards the cost of the screen which was 79.99 for the iPhone 8. I am so happy with how quickly they fix my phone. I was afraid that they would need it for a few days, but I got it in the evening of the same day.<//review>

<text>I brought in my phone because the screen was lifting up. They charged me 30 and ran a diagnostic. They called me as I was driving home from work and said the battery was bulging and it was pressing on the screen. I was lucky I had an older android because it just pushed up the lcd and didn't break it. They said they had to order the part in and needed a deposit so I told them I would swing by the next day to take care of that. Two days later they called me and said my phone was ready for pickup. I felt like i was going to die without my phone for a few days, but it feels so good to have it back.</text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1571948392873, 'text': 'So glad we got that in quickly and fixed the battery Andre.

Came to buy a laptop cause mine broke and they said it was new as in i would get a charger with it but they didn't have the original one and they had to rest the computer had to leave came back and now said it's extra for the charger because it didn't come with one so much for a " brand new one"</Text>
<name>Cassandra Esmeralda<//name><response>{'time': 1590537714179, 'text': 'Sorry but this is false. The laptop was listed as a used laptop and the posting did say AS IS with no accessories. Hence the listing price. We had to reset the laptop so that it could be sold and we then offered to find a charger that would work for you, But at NO TIME DID WE OFFER YOU ONE FREE. The laptop was offered to you at a discount cause of your story of being broke and we love to help out the community but we wont be taken advantage of. Once you were given price with a universal charger you declined but adding such a false story to the narrative is sad. Also next time your upset i recommend putting seat-belts on before having your boyfriend run his engine to the ground trying to peel off making such a obscene statement.

<Text>My external hard drive was working and the next minute it wasn't. All of my pictures are on it as I use it as a backup of my phone and computer.
I went to Ubreak Ifix and they just referred me to xxxx, which wanted to charge me $700 to $3000 to diagnose and recover the data from the drive.
I then called Love 2 Fix and brought the device in for Chris to examine. Within 10 minutes he diagnosed that the drive was ok and he could fix it.  As I was filling out the paperwork, everything on my device appreared on his monitor.
I am so thankful for Chris and his employees at Love 2 Fix! All of my pictures since 2015 was on this drive including my daughter's wedding.
I HIGHLY recommend tgis to anyone with a computer, phone, or any device problem.

Thank you Chris!</Text>< Pictures>

Did exactly what I needed at a fair price. When it looked like there might have to  be another screen change, they didnt make it seem like it was a huge problem. If I have any other issues, this is where I will go back to.< /Review>

I brought my laptop into these guys,  it was having connection issues.  They had no issues telling me what was, how to fix it,  and how long it would take.  These guys were professional but at the same time you could see they like their work.

Now my computer runs better than ever and it didn't break the bank! Thanks for saving this college kid!</Text>

cheapest, quickest, nicest, and most honest shop in sac. Yeah some places might have cheap iPhone repairs but keep in mind they're using awful chinese aftermarket screens. Love 2 fix uses beautiful oem parts and their attentiveness to detail really shows. truly the best< /review>

<text>I messaged love 2 fix at 2am with a question about my iPod classic not synching anymore  not expecting a reply and went to bed. When I work up the next day they responded to my question overnight telling me to bring it in for a diagnostic because there could be a few problems that cause that issues. $29.99 later and they told me that the hard drive was broken and they could upgrade me to a flash card so that it ran faster and held more storage. They took the cost of the diagnostic off the repairs and the iPod runs better than ever!< /text>< Time>

<Review>Brought in a few phones to sell, just had them laying around and wasn't sure what to expect. The guy up front was laid back and spent time looking at them and explaining what he was looking for. Was able to walk out with a decent amount of cash for phones that I thought were useless. I will be back to have them help me finish the computer that I am working on.

If you're looking for friendly, this is the place to go.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I do not recommend this place at all!!
They took my iphone 6S it apparently had water damage. I paid them 170$ I came to pick up my phone 1st time..it wasn't turning on still ... they told me to come back..I came back the 2nd time.. i was in a rush to get my kids from school so I didn't even test the phone.. I trusted them because I've been here before many times .. I take my phone .. I get in my car..down the road I decide to turn it on and it still doesn't turn on.. I called them and they told me to bring it back.. which I did few days later ..
Anyways they call me and tell me.
Oh well it's not the boardwash .. its something else..
It will be more money..
Like hello..I paid 30 diagnostic fee.  .. they told me its the boardwash.   Itll fix the problem... that's why they told me to pick up the phone .. and i did..so obviously you guys dont know what you're doing!!!
I told them I already spent 170$ on this phone.  It's not worth it . I wont pay more to fix it. I told them to give me my phone back.. they agreed but TO KEEP MY MONEY TOO!!!! they only refunded me 70$!!!
They CHARGED ME FOR THEIR " Labor " like excuse me ???? I picked up my phone in the same condition as I left it ..NOT WORKING !! I DONT CARE if you worked on it...YOU STILL DIDNT FIX THE  PROBLEM !!!! AND GAVE ME MY BROKEN PHONE BACK... just becaus and couldnt fix it.
They didnt charge a diagnostic fee nor any other fee!!!!

Because they couldnt get the job done
That's what this owner should have done

I wish I drove the extra mile and didnt try to save on gas !! These guys suck !!
Took my phone and gave me back a broken phone and the owner Chris. ..you lack customer service
And you're a very mean person. .< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Love to fix, more like love to scam! My overall experience in fixing or trying to get my ps4 resulted in my ultimate downfall in even being able to turn it on again. The staff even made purchase an unnecessary software update. In the end I'm out 107 dollars an a busted ps4. I do recommend. What an awful experience!<//Text>
<pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1554763570044, 'text': 'My apologies i almost didnt recognize you with the fake name. You came in for a damaged hdmi port which was fixed. Once fixed we tested and booted your device infront of you. Your system stated you needed to reinstall the firmware. We charged you 29.99 for the firmware install to the hard drive yes. You came back a few days later with the device claiming it would not turn on. We powered it up and left it playing for 5 hours. We informed you of this and when you returned for the device we had rebooted it over 15 times. Consequently the issue you have lays dormant. The apu on your device is failing but not dead. It is working and was so when you left. I personally briefed you on total cost to repair and how that would work with your current repair. Unfortunetly with the physical damage to the port and the fact that they are 2 seperated issues we would not be able to refund for the hdmi port which is working and fixed. Should you choose to fix the apu issue then we would be more then happy to bundle the 2 together but it would not be a same day service to get done. I know you were in a bit of a rush to complete it. Feel free to give us a call if you wish to complete it. Have a great day'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

My iphone touch has been weird and laggy so I checked it in for a diagnostic with the technician and he said I would get a call by the end of the day. I got a call about 40 minutes later and they said that they could fix the problem by swapping my screen because the digitizer was cracked from when I dropped it. I paid 29.99 for them to look at my phone and they took that cost out of the repair so I only paid the difference to get it fixed. I only paid about 75 total to get my screen fixed and I have not had a problem since!</review></record>

{'time': 1565835271185, 'text': "Sorry to hear your not pleased. We walked your daughter through the entire repair costs for a new hard drive along with data swap and logic board work since she was the customer on record who brought the laptop in. It's very hard to understand what was needed since this was our first interaction on this device but with devices that have been worked on this heavily in the past we wanted to make sure everything was clear. We made sure at each junction to call and inform you daughter of the process and what we had found. We did not upsell you or your daughter on anything. Only recommended a new hard drive since we confirmed hers was dead which is common with the sounds you were hearing. We recovered her data and installed it to the new SSD she chose from our options. We gave her the prices and differences on the entirety of the repair. I understand you may not have been given the entire picture since we were dealing with your daughter but I highly recomend talking to her since she was made aware of all costs and balances and work that was needed to be performed . Before doing so as policy. Either way best wishes and if you or her ever need anything we are at your service always."}</response>
<text>they had fixed in my phone for me before as well as a laptop and I was really pleased. I brought in my daughter's MacBook that had an intermittent shutdown issue as well as a rattle in the hard drive and we replace the hard drive and they up sold me on installing something else that I really don't understand what the hell it was gave me the impression that the laptopwas worth more than what it was so I okayed the repair and then they came back and told me that the intermittent shut down if she wasn't resolved and that I needed to replace the screen and I was going to be another three hundred bucks which would be worth more than the damn computer was so all-in-all I'm not really pleased at all</text><Time>1565832730735< /Time><Rate>2</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>Several days ago, I took my mobile for a simple repair to a shop called Love 2 Repair. They promised to fix my mobile for $75 however, they didn’t mention about any inspection fee of ($29) in the beginning. When I checked back to have my mobile, they said that they were unable to fix my mobile and instead they asked for an extra money ($29) for its inspection. Please avoid going to this shop for any type of repairing!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

If they could fix it, will allow you to apply that $33 toward total repair cost.  Price is somewhat steep for their labor.   My repair cost $80 and for me to buy a new one is around $400.  Not significant saving since you don't know how long before it craps out again.  The only reason I went ahead with this repair is because it takes few weeks for my new printer to arrive.< /Text>< Pictures>

{'time': 1541313080665, 'text': 'Hello Basil, sorry you feel that way about the labor costs. Your thermal printer was an interesting case in which not many have the knowledge to work on in our industry. Your total cost was 79.99 which in turn is about 3 hours of labor. If you break that down then the total cost is less then 27 dollars an hour. I can assure you this is pretty reasonable for specialty electronics. Also that does come with a 90 day warranty on our labor. So if something happens or goes out again feel free to bring it back in anytime. I hope that helps and feel free to contact myself or any one here anytime. Have a great weekend.'}<//resp>

{'time': 1580313959993, 'text': "Apologies ivan but our diagnostics were made clear when you dropped the device off, you paid the 29.99 and nothing more. We then spent close to 4 hours diagnosing and attempting to fix the issue to your logic board. Based on the information you gave us we tried our original camera sets to see if you maybe bought a aftermarket then under the microscope we found tool damage to components around the camera line and after replacing the damaged components found issues to the power line of the cameras. With the way the damage was done to your logic board when you attempted to fix it yourself , simply put the cost to fix the issue would outweigh the cost of a new board. If for some reason I could have helped you understand that better then apologizes but our diagnostics are a benefit to our customers and ourselves so we can put the highest amount of time into in depth repairs like this, otherwise most shops find out it's a logic board issue and state it is unrepairable hence they put no more then 10 minutes into checking on the issue. I understand it can be frustrating when something is broken and you've tried to fix it only to find you've made the issue worse, but were only here to help.\nAlso just for the record I returned your device to you in the exact condition you brought it into me. Theres been no further damage to your board nor components to it. If you would like to come by I'll let you view it under the scope so you can get a better understanding of everything and the damage that was done.\nHave a great day."}</resp>

I visited my friend in California and on my very last day at the state, I broke my iPhone Screen. The screen was shattered and I could not even touch it.  Chris fixed my screen and I was able to still leave same day and did not miss my flight.  Their pricing is reasonable too. Thank you! I'm more careful now, I got a Tempered glass screen protector.< /text>

amazing work on my gaming PC, swapped out my GPU for a Geforce 1060 6GB with custom LED lighting on it. it preforms great, it looks great, and they even cleaned out the dust and re- applied my thermal paste for free. 10/10 look forward to upgrading with them again< /Review>

It's a little out of the way, but worth the effort. I'd banged up my Samsung pretty good and was referred to this shop by another one unwilling to take a chance on my phone. Sure, I could spend the $225 deductible and get a new phone from the insurance plan, but it's only 6 months old, so...

Bottom line, they were successful at saving my phone and saving me $160 over what my deductible would have cost me. VERY pleased with the pricing and same-day service.< /text>

Had a few things fixed and they have left a impressive impression. Great advice on how i should maintain battery life and much more.
Left feeling refreshed like my devices were brand new with shiney screen protectors on them.
Wont be going back to the big guys on sunrise again.
In total love 2 fix saved me over 120$

They don't have that price-gougey feel that the other repair places have. If you've tried to replace your broken phone screen before, you know what I'm talking about.

Just go here for your repairs. It's worth it.< /review>< Pics>

My iPhone 6 had some crazy issues (ghosting, anonymously starting and closing apps, and unresponsive screen). I tried all software fixes including completely erasing and restoring it to factory specs, but that didn't fix it. The owner, Chris, took on my phone and performed a motherboard diagnosis. He discovered the touch chip and a trace was bad so he soldered in a new touch chip and replaced a few others along with a new screen and fixed the trace. Still didn't solve all the issues so he took another look and replaced the screen 2nd time and also added thermal paste to the cpu to help cooling. These guys did a huge amount of diagnosis and many hours of labor and parts to help fix my broken phone. But, ultimately, it looks like I'd need a new cpu or motherboard and it's not worth fixing since I can just get a new or newer phone for the price. Sometimes that's just how it works. Chris gave me store credit because he felt bad that he couldn't completely fix the phone. Any future phone issues, I will go to these guys again! Thank you for all the work you did!</text>

<text>Awful in at least two ways:
1) They can't seem to actually repair my cell, and I suspect  they fixed  everytime I went this place phone have different problem.

2) Really bad about communicating when your stuff is ready. You can't expect them to call or email when it's done; you have to drive every few days. Actually bad communicators in general -- they seem to really want you to go away. After all repair and time loss I purchased another new phone do not waste your time and money visiting this place.< /text>< user>

We in turn shared some of that cost with you as discussed previous to the repair.\n\nWhen you dropped off the X the Unlock technician personally spoke with you about trying to remove the icloud and what the 3rd party would charge for that service and what we would mark up the service in turn.\n\nAlso we only charged you the cost of a shop diagnostic which is $29 compared to the $47 the 3rd party charged us. During your drop off the technician spoke to you about these costs and the likely-hood of the imei exchange working without having access to the information to check. He also notified you of the time frame 3/5 business days at most and how the service worked.\n\nI have reviewed this conversation per our indoor cameras since you were so intent that not any cost was described to you so i wanted to get to the bottom of that ASAP. I have myself heard the technician in fact did describe the cost that would be associated if the device was in the Stolen/Lost mode.\n\nIts understandable to be frustrated Since your at a loss by purchasing such a device in the first place but i am unsure why this is aimed at us. We are here to help and did everything in our power to do so. In the future should you need anything we are always here to help .

They take your money for doing nothing. They kept my phone for one week and returned it without fixing, yet they asked for the money. Do not go to them.</text>

<Text>Horrible Service! My brother's phone screen began to peel off after these people "fixed it" within 2 weeks. The cost was approx. $150 for the screen and the labor approx. $130. The screen then detached from the phone and it was broken again. The TECH apparently applied SUPER GLUE to hold the screen in place, however, it was not strong enough to hold.

The TECH then said our 30 day warranty does not cover " IF THE PHONE FALLS" and therefore a new screen is needed (another $150). I was so upset with this and I told him how I felt he did a POOR job with the repair. HOW IS A SCREEN GOING TO COME OFF SO FAST WITH THE PHONE NOT FALLING?

DONT COME HERE, SUCH POOR QUALITY!!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Great service & customer service. My son's gaming computer stopped working. It is an expensive purchase several years ago, out of warranty & to ship to vendor on the east coast would be little over $150 (that's what it cost me for warranty repair). I have used Love 2 Fix to salvage my sister coffee drowned Mac Box Air and a screen replacement of Fit Bit Blaze (because Fit Bit isn't set up to repair their own devices). Both time were stellar service. However this time, they went over the top. We dropped off the computer around 10:30. They would diagnose and call me with what they found - probably in the afternoon. Less than an hour they had been able to determine it was a failed power supply - they would get one locally and the computer would probably be ready sometime tomorrow. So imagine my surprise when John called me before 4 pm - the computer was fixed and ready for pick up. That is like a 5 hour turn around! I tell my family and friends that Love 2 Fix is the best store to get your electronics fixed. Prices are very reasonable, service is awesome, customer service is the best. 3 times customer - will be 4th time - as I am dropping off my IPAD tomorrow to fix a disabled issue compounded by Find My IPAD problem that I can not get past.< /text>< time>

<text>I wish they had an option for 0 Stars. Went in to get my screen replaced for an iPhone 6 Plus. Was happy to hear that there was a 15% off because they over stocked on screen replacements for that phone. When I came back to get my phone they said they had to replace the battery because it exploded while they were working on my phone. They charged me $30 more bucks. I let it slide only because they gave me a deal on the screen replacement. Then when we were checking out he sold me on screen protector which was the smart idea but seemed like he was just selling me. I ended up spending big $160 when it initially should of been $120. Two weeks go by and a spot of orange popped up on my screen. Took it in and he said it was the frame of my phone that was damaging the screen. (I never seen this before). He said he fixed it but it came back within 1 day. 2 more weeks go by and the screen replacement starts coming off. So I took it in and told him about it and he said it was my frame. And then he took the screen replacement off and THEN said it was the battery was pushing the screen up and that's the problem. Seems like too many excuses. I told him he charged me for a battery replacement. So we looked up my name for the recent charges and there was 2 transactions one for $119.00(screen replacement) and another for $36.00(battery & screen protector). And he told me that he didn't replace the battery that it's the original. So he tried to sale me on another battery! I asked him if a screen protector costs $36.00 and he said yes. I googled screen protector and they're $5-10. I got ripped off. I'm buying a new phone. This was my first and last experience going to a 3rd party phone repair shop. Thanks! If anyone wants to get ripped off come to this place right here!</text>< Pictures>

I found this shop online and took my laptop to them i have a problem with my laptop and they charge me 69.99$ for the diagnostic and i told them before that I don’t have the charger for my laptop they said it’s fine we Figure it out and I left. After 4 days i call them and check my laptop status they said we don’t have charger we’re waiting for you for bring charger I said why you guys didn’t tell me that day 1. So I could have arrange the charger. anyway i order new charger and give it to them and after 2 days they told me hard drive is bad and need to be replaced and new Operating system need to be installed. so they told me over the phone that hard drive Installation 99.99$ and  operating system cost 129.99 so total cost me 230 plus tax but your diagnostic fee will cover 70 dollors of the total cost. 230 - 70.  I said ok please fix my laptop after 2 days they fix my laptop i go there for pick up my laptop they said total is 280 somthing. They said that diagnostic fee will not cover The total cost. And that it is already removed from the prices listed above. No one told me that before. Long story short. I will never go to those people again. It’s really stupid for them to tell someone one thing and at the end say something else. I paid so much extra for no reason. Then they started saying oh we gave you discount 129.99 on install the windows. Over regular price is 199. Who charge 200 to install windows?. Totally trying to change the topic and having me pay more then what they said at the beginning. Worst experience ever idk how they have 4.1 stars. Probably fake reviews...</review>

<Resp>{'time': 1545082993411, 'text': "Hey Shah, sorry to hear your unhappy. Here's the same response I provided to you on yelp. We spoke the night you dropped the device off and I spoke about the que and how long it would take to get a call with current work going on in the que. My apologies if we didnt get that done sooner then qouted but on time. Our universal was not charging your device after the diagnostic was completed and I apologize but it would have taken longer to replace the tips then you to bring in yours, we only needed it to test a new hdd in your system after we determined the issues with your hard drive at that point. You did not tell us about ordering one as you stated you would simply bring it by that day. I see your frustrations with that and wish I knew it was an issue. Two days later our new charger tips arrived and you dropped your old charger off the same day a hour apart,  Also I went over the recording to confirm due to our conversation of us never giving you those prices and  we did make the qoute clear to you about you bringing your own hard drive vs us providing one and the cost of software and installation. We spoke 3 times about pricing and  the cost of everything. Phillip specifically broke it down to you the first time we qouted it by giving you the total remaining price and the end total paid price. The edit dates on your invoice as well state it was clearly updated only after the call to get your approval so I do stand behind phillip on the qoute he provided and the work he completed. We Also spoke that we could not transfer your old hacked key that was for the wrong windows. We refuse to use or endorse fraudulent windows copies so it's understandable when people do not know the cost of new copies from Microsoft.  We apologize if this confuses you in any way. We made sure to be specific each time speaking to you on overall cost and remaining amounts due. Should you care to listen to the qoutes feel free to swing in anytime. Sorry we wouldnt remove our labor out as you insisted but we stuck to our qoute from start to finish. Hopefully that helps and should you need anything feel free to contact me directly anytime.\n\nHappy holiday's."}</Resp><gmap_id>0x809adc209b732dbd:0x544827a4975d768a</gmap_id></record>

<Text>Long story and long history. We were dealing with things that separate the honorable men from the frauds and Chris is an honorable man. Not much could have gone worse from a hardware view, but from a customer service view nothing could have gone better.
Chris and his crew not only have a customer for life but a friend as well.

<time>1544640423884<//time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Anything and everything I’ve ever had fixed here beyond having a phone screen replaced lasts less than 60 days. Here’s a few examples.

PS3- “can’t be fixed.” My BF and roomate went online and you tubed it and now it works great. This is after them charging me for a diagnostic I told them I’d already done at home.
LABTOP BATTERY- any and every time the replaces a component it never lasted long. Heads up. They get their replacement parts from eBay. Which means 2 things. They can’t guarantee quality (this comes up again in the next example) and if for some reason you go outside of the warranty they have with this supplier you don’t know and can’t independently validate, then you’re looking at paying for parts twice.
iPhone - Screen replacement turned into it needing a mother board replaced. Not their fault. Through a series of eBay shenanigans they had my phone for 3 weeks (remember when I said that their suppliers were suspect?) and I had to contact them periodically for updates. So fine, they fix it. Finally. It lasted 2 months. A month of which I was on vacation in a remote part of Montana with cell service. Was barely on my phone so I didn’t notice that they hadn’t fixed anything. I come back after it started getting glitchy again. Same problems as it had before and after dropping 400 some odd dollars on parts and labor. “Well it’s past the warranty with the supplier” they said. We can try and dispute it. Never heard back. I had to call them after a few weeks for an update. To find out their was “nothing they could do.”
Over the years I’ve probably spent 1000 dollars here and have nothing to show for it. They won’t get my business again. I highly suggest you look elsewhere. A place that that uses “super glue because I couldn’t find the screw” isn’t worth the money. That said, they’re super friendly. Buyer beware.<//text>< pics>

They lie and make it seem like they can fix your phone just so they can take your money for a diagnostics, save your time and money and send it to a data recovery place where you have to ship.</text>

{'time': 1578616882572, 'text': "Apologies Clara, but on the invoice we have for you your name was put down as Princess. I understand please feel free to contact us directly for a resolution. I completely understand your upset that we cannot get your device information off the Bent iPhone 8 Plus, We recommend sending it out because the board is physically bent so the connection internal to the board is damaged.  Im unsure what size vehicle ran this over but the damage is severe enough the entire housing fell to pieces in starting the diagnostic. Clumps of components on the board smashed to pieces. We've restored all physical hardware to the logic board but the device still will not take power. The next step would be to remove your memory in attempt to restore function but that's not what you want so we now will refer to a more invasive technique for your data recovery. If you wanted just the phone back up and running then no problem i can fix that for you but the cost would outweigh the replacement cost and hence it would not be efficient for your needs nor your pocket book. The company we are recommending will take the components off your board that hold the memory and retrieve it in that way. That's our recommendation and you can send it in or not the choice is completely up to you.\n\nHopefully you have a better day. Were always here if you need us."}<//resp>

I was working on a school assignment and the deadline was at 10 pm. I was lucky to find this place, I did not believe when the told me it would not take long to fix it. My macbook was ready in no time and it was as if nothing ever happened to it. The price too was unbeatable.Nice job guys, u sure know what you're doing.<//review>< pics>

I absolutely love this place. Everything is explained clearly and upfront and all the guys are knowledgeable and professional. I can’t explain how happy I am with their service and the fact that they saved me $600. This is the 2nd time I have had something fixed here and I will be a customer for life! Wouldn’t even think about going somewhere else!

I spilled water on my 2017 MacBook Air. Apple told me $750 just to fix it, not replace it. FYI Applecare is a rip-off, it covers barely anything and no physical damage. Love2fix charged me $129 and my laptop is working like nothing happened! I’m so grateful for this place. Definitely go with them for anything you need fixed. Places like this are why small businesses should be supported.<//review>

<username>Ali JawanMard< /username><Review>I’m not usually rate low any business
But this repair shop is a Highway  robbery
Someone referred  my cousin to this place
Hi phone had a charging problem after inspection they told him it’s going to cost you $75 dollar they are both agree to fix it then the tech said come tomorrow and get your phone it will be fix
Next day they called and said we are not able to fix it  my cousin said ok I gonna come and get my phone after he was asking to give the phone the manager was asking for $29.99 for no reason after
I know some places that fix his phone for $30 but the problem is they hold his phone and not give it to him back now my cousin is don’t know what to do
I strongly suggest you guys don’t waste your money and your time
There all places doing better job for less price
Thanks<//Review>< Date>

<Review>Sold them a phone on Ebay. they asked for a return. I refunded the money and now they don't want to return the phone or answer my messages. I even talked to him on the phone and he is using ebay policy to rip me off and not return my item.

Go tell whomever you want. You are a thief who took my item got his money back and the shipping money.

Ebay specifically instructed me to contact you regarding the return.<//Review>< pictures>

We have not recieved a single call or message about this but if you would like to get it fixed properly we can adress that for you. Glad to hear the screen is still in good Shape and working properly though. Hope that helps and if you need us were always here. Have a great day.'}</response>

If you were unhappy with the work and were an ACTUAL customer of ours you would know that there is a 90 day warranty on our work. Looking at your account as well most of your reviews are overseas which leads me to believe the following; A. You are not an actual customer of ours. and B. are doing it because you think it is a great idea to slander a business that you've never been to. I have the screenshot of everywhere you've reviewed if you would like to discuss this further.\n\nNow, that being said should you ever have a question on a repair, please feel free to contact us at any time."}< /Response>

<Review>I called and asked if they fix overboard,on the first time they said what is overboard ,but after some minutes they called me  back and said bring it we are fixing it for you .They charged me for $30 and after 2 days called me that we couldn't fixed it . It means they kept it for sometime to show that they worked on it.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1565835530857, 'text': 'Apologies but renewing your review from a year ago had me confused since we havent had a overboard in quite some time come in. We charged you a diagnostic then qouted you the price to fix the gyro issues by replacing the right side main board, that would have solved the problem you were having. We did not keep the device any longer then it took you to pick it up after you declined the option to fix. Have a great day.'}< /Response>

I've been taking my phones and laptops to Chris for 4+ years.  These people love their jobs and it shows. They offer fair pricing, are honest, hardworking and trustworthy. I purchased a refurbished Lenovo ThinkPad at a great price and it works like brand new. Thanks Chris and guys!<//text>

Ordered here twice and the crust of their pizza is good, but they dont have much sauce on the pizza just a whole lot of cheese. Not only that the woman and man that answers the phone are really rude and snotty, not friendly at all. Won't be ordering from here anymore.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Pizza is good for the price,  but the fried chicken I probably wouldn't order again I will go for the chicken wings instead next time. I make pretty good fried chicken so my expectations on that are kinda high... I ordered by phone and when I walked in she already knew what I ordered... I assume she thought my voice matched my face, and not that because they where super slow in business.</Review><date>1519535749526<//date>< Name>

<Date>1537749767490<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This pizza will go do down in the history of Bakersfield, and they deserve it. I have been eating from Mike's familiar and tasty pizza since I was a little kid and eat it now still many years later. My friends and I go and order from here all the time and it is the best always. Obviously they are a local run so they meet some pretty good standards. It is my dream to want to invest in Mike's Pizza and capitalize their food to greater heights when I grow up.<//Text>< pictures>

I love this pizza. It's better than all of the major pizza stores, in my opinion. The cheese used on the pizzas is cheese I can't get enough of. The pizzas only take 15 min to prepare; very fast. And the staff is very nice. I hope they are still around for years and years to come.
Also the wedges here are tasty and the ranch is too, just make sure to get the ranch in a tiny foam cup, not in the packet.</text>

Divey pizzeria and bar. The pizza was tasty, although signature pizzas were more pricey. The Summer Salad, we scraped the last piece of lettuce and candied walnut from the plate. Garlic bombs were very oily and heavy. Most tables were dirty and had trash and serviceware still on the table. Despite the appearance, the pizza was fairly good, and better than chain take out/delivery restaurants, and we would return.</Review>

Menu is small, but complete for a pizza place; they have wings, garlic bread, and wedges too. Pizza has fresh ingredients and is very tasty. Not real greasy either. Prices are cheaper than most places. Very friendly staff. Cash, credit, no debit. A couple tables for eating-in if needed.<//Text>

Granted I came in with no appointment he didn't honor his price with out appointment which was 5 dollars less I believe but worst of all he diced me up like a vegetable. Like I said I came in with out appointment but he should of just told me he wasn't gonna have time. When he was done he didn't hold the mirror for me to check out my hair cause he knew he had cut me up pretty bad. I honestly didn't notice till I got home and touched my neck ans worst of all I tipped him an extra 10 bucks. Never going back wish I could get my money back.</Text>

Took 30-45 minutes to wait.  Well worth it.  Best cut and beard trim I have had in a while.  Those complaining about the service need to realize it’s a barber shop, not a salon.  Highly recommend it.</review>< Pics>

I waited a little bit cause I didn't have an appointment so I got to see each one of them cut hair. Every barber there was a perfectionist and took their time with every cut/line. It is definitely recommended to make an appointment with anyone. All the barbers are really good so they all have appointments.

I got my haircut by Willie he's the first chair when you walk in.  He was very polite and a very good barber for someone who just got started. He asked a lot of questions just to make sure I had my hair the way I wanted it.

I also want to mention that these guys still cut my hair even though I was there until after the store closed. They have never seen me because I'm not from around here I just chose this barbershop cause it had great reviews. Some places aren't so welcoming to newcomers and usually don't care for newcomers.

I highly recommend this shop to anyone who is in the area looking for a good cut. I paid the regular price $15. If I could give this place 10 stars I would.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Excellent place to get a cut!! barbers are extremely friendly after having to wait for quite a while, the barber made me feel like I was the only person there by taking his time. the atmosphere is very pleasant/friendly, so even though you normally have to wait IT IS FOR SURE WORTH THE WAIT!! THANKS GUYS!! will definitely come back, think I just found my new barber!!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This barber shop is all about perfection and customer satisfaction. All barbers are very skilled. My son is mixed with African American so his hair is a bit tricky to cut and style. This place knows exactly what to do when it comes to any type of hair texture. It is always busy because they do an excellent job; however the owner always makes a way to squeeze in all walk-ins. The barbers take their time with each person and that is why we faithfully go to this barber shop time and time again. Great cuts - for a kids cut we have paid between $10-15 bucks including tip.<//Text>< Pics>

By outside appearance, you might write this place off as some shady hole in the wall, or not even notice it, but that is very deceiving.  The inside is very clean with a masculine, modern style to it and just a tiny hint of 20s vintage.

The location is a reflection of the staff as well.  At first glance you might be temped to write them off as one thing or another, but regardless of what you may take from appearance, they are true professional barbers.  They won't fawn over you, but they are very friendly, welcoming, and able to give you whatever kind of cut you're looking for(and help you find out what that is in my case), all at a good price and a timely manner.

If you're looking for something other than the hospital waiting rooms of more commercial barbers, at a quality and price that beats them. I highly recommend you stop by.</Text>

This place is amazing! Prices are perfect, and the people are chill. After going here, I won't be shaving my beard myself, the price is just right I can go once or twice a week.<//Review>

Their chairs are what are untouchable. I wasted 3 hours of my day waiting to get my hair cut and was never seen. Everyone else was allowed to cut in front of me. This place is a joke.</Text>

<Text>While  visit  liberty station San Diego if you’re interested in US Navy history this is a great stop. There  is plenty of parking close to the ship. The ship was commissioned on July 27, 1949. It was commissioned for 18 years for much of that time it was the only landlocked ship to hold that status in the US Navy. It was used to train recruits. She is an impressive sight on land for sure! She was built to scale 2/3 the size of a Dealey class destroyer escort. She sits at the former Navy Training Center, San Diego. This ship assisted the training of over 50,000 new recruits per year, the ship still stands showing honor, courage and commitment. She is currently unused With the hopes that she will someday become a Maritime Museum. This was a must see for us.</Text>< Rating>

Such a beautiful ship, Although it never was used as a actual vessel and its fake. Despite it being smaller than the ship it's based after, its actually quite big. I hope to see her again in a condition that's just as good as she is today<//text>

Div 8, Co 170 1991. The gas chamber was directly across the street off her port side. Staggered down the steps and let the air flush the gas from your eyes beside this ship! It's an upscale condo community. I went there last year and a group of women were pushing strollers in neon tights doing "mommy" PT on our bridge where we had to at ease march to cross for chow.< /Text>

Great to still see it is standing, as it's the only one of 3 built for training future sailors that was kept. Brought back wonderful memories of my time in San Diego. While RTC and NTC are no more, the area was developed well and keeps history alive. Wonderful Park and trails to exercise. Give this place a visit for sure on your next visit.< /text>

This "ship" was a part of the base where I attended boot camp back in 1990. We learned a great deal about ship operations & safety procedures. The worst part was going through the "Gas Chamber" room inside the "ship", You would go in and don your mask. Room fills with tear gas. You took off your mask, inhaled the gas, and then had to don your mask again. Your eyes watered and snot ran down your nose. Good times!</review>

I don't mean to diminish its historical significance but it's just a building disguised as a ship. You can't go inside. I wandered upon it by accident and took a few photos.< /Review>

<text>I had my wisdom teeth removed at OMS and I can attest to the fact that the staff are amazing. They are very well informed, offer great advice for after care (make sure to follow their directions), and the extraction procedure was so easy to deal with. I highly recommend coming here if you are in need of having your teeth removed. Keep up the excellent work OMS!<//text><GmapID>0x80dcdbf80d7e3345:0xb99dc9058b67086d</GmapID><Name>Javier Ramos< /Name>< Pictures>

I was so scared of getting my wisdom teeth extracted! I literally had been in pain for a bit over 1 year because I couldn’t find an oral surgeon that I felt comfortable enough w/ to follow through w/ the procedure but, when I found OMS and I went in for the consultation I felt like that was the place ! The staff was great, everyone was really informative. We scheduled my procedure & followed through w/ it and everything seems to be healing accordingly ! 1 week post up! The process was great & easy ! 🙏🙏🙏< /text>

I don’t even know where to start with Dr Ali, but after breaking my front top tooth below the gum line, I was devastated.  Then after hearing about an implant and the cost not covered at all by insurance, I was really down.

Then I met Dr Ali and his staff, and immediately felt comfortable. Dr Ali is very detail oriented and offers thoughtful insight and explanations. Then when the time came for surgery he was equally reassuring. He had a very soft touch, was down to earth and very humorous at times, and I trust him completely with my implant construction.

If I could give he and his staff 6 stars, I would. I wish that I could have him as my regular dentist, but he is a specialist.  I strongly recommend this office for your surgical dental needs< /text>

I have had the good fortune of having Dr. Amrollahie as my Oral Surgeon. He has taken care of my friends and family. I did extractions of Wisdom Teeth after having horrible pain. We trust his work and his advice completely, and all of his work has been outstanding. We highly recommend!
Thank you< /text>

I was terrified of getting my wisdom teeth out for years but after the consultation and being educated on how it works I felt so at peace and confident with the doctors. Staff is extremely friendly and made the process so easy. Procedure was quick and recovery has been fantastic. Thanks to the team at OMS of SC. You guys are awesome!<//Review>

<Review>Visiting Dr. Ali for my surgical wisdom tooth extraction was a
great experience.  Normally you don't think of visiting the dentist
as a great experience, but....  Dr. Ali and his staff immediately put
me at ease.  I have a very small mouth opening and it is
difficult to work in my mouth.

I told Dr. Ali that he has Golden Hands.  He was able to numb
the area and extract the tooth with no difficulties.  He has a gentle
demeanor and touch.  His knowledge and experience made
this extraction a solid surgical experience.

He even called me to follow up within an hour!  He is the best.
I definitely recommend him.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>My experience was overall very good! The people are very nice and friendly. The procedure to me felt super quick maybe because I was lightly sedated but after there was little to no pain, just some swelling which is normal! Highly recommend this place!<//review>< pics>

I had a great experience going through surgery to remove my wisdom teeth with this dentist office! When you make your first appointment they explain everything clearly and make sure to answer any questions you may have. They also give you the option to scan fully your teeth if they think there might be a risk during the procedure that could harm your nerves. On the day of the surgery I was nervous but they made me feel comfortable and had a conversation with me to distract me while I was put to sleep. Once I woke up I didn’t remember anything at all. They gave me instructions for the proper recovery and gave me the proper medications to aid me. No complaints and it was a 10/10 experience.< /Review>

<Text>I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a better visit than what I experienced at OMS in Tustin. The staff is so warm, inviting and kind but also informative, reassuring and professional. My wisdom teeth extraction process was smooth sailing from start to finish, and the post-op appointment was of the same value. I had a few follow up questions regarding discomfort between visits, and they were both extremely informative over the phone, reassuring, and offered to squeeze me in within that hour if needed. I would recommend this office to anyone.< /Text>< pics>

My regular dentist gave me a referral here for a wisdom tooth extraction. The service here is incredible and personal. Everyone is super friendly and my wisdom tooth extraction took less than 10 minutes with hardly any pain afterwards. I'd make them my personal dental office if they offered  that service, unfortunately  they dont :(<//review>

<text>The staff in this office is amazing, they’re all very friendly and make you feel welcomed. Called to make appointment and was scheduled quickly. The doctor was great, explained step by step how the procedure would be and day of he and his staff made me feel comfortable and I did not feel any pain. My healing process is going well hardly any pain and no bruising, my dentist referred me for an extraction, other doctors I had in the past left me bruised and swollen.  Celine was there during the procedure and my check-up she is awesome, very knowledgeable and went above and beyond thank you Celine!!! I highly recommend anyone who needs oral surgery to come to this office the staff is top notch!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>5</rate><UserId.>104797732987402196006</UserId.><time>1607581833701<//time></record>

The recovery was extremely smooth and I had the same positive experience when I went to get my ninth tooth pulled out. I highly recommend coming here!<//text>

<text>To say it was one of the best experiences with an oral surgeon, and the staff, HUGE UNDERSTATEMENT !!!  I had extractions, bone graph, and skin graph. I was terrified !! Plus this being done with me awake. I was put at ease from the moment I walked in for the surgical procedure. The surgeon is outstanding, as well as the staff!! I never felt a thing, I was constantly reassured that I was doing ok, and constantly asked if I was feeling anything. The surgeon was warm and kind, talked me all the way through it, always made sure mentally I was doing ok, the nurses were just as reassuring and kind. I have NEVER seen a more caring, kind, friendly staff, and surgeons, highly recommend this office, a definite 5 star!!!</text>< pics>

The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I brought my pet in that was recently rescued and they was so nice and gentle with her. They cleaned her up and had her looking so pretty. I recommend this place for everyone. Plus the prices are great.< /Review>

<Text>I do not recommend this groomer they did the worst job ever on my fury baby with one ear short and the other long, and found all kinds of patches of long hair everywhere. For 50 bucks this could have been sooo much better… WORST PLACE EVER!!!!!<//Text>< pics>

Went to get my yorkie terrier a hair cut to even her hair out and they cut it too short.
It's not a bad job, just didn't asked for it to be so short. Gave a 4 star because I asked them if they could do it and felt they were just agreeing with me, just to agree.<//review>

I have been taking my dog  since they opened.  I am so pleased with Pet Grooming. My dog already knows when we are going and she knows all of them. The treatment they all give my dog is  excellent.  The grooming is always great and the prices are great.. I have gotten services from other pet groomers and there is no comparison to Pet Grooming.< /text>

< Review>
STAY AWAYY FROM THIS PLACE!!! Took my Pomeranian for a haircut, horrible job uneven, worst part  his coat is super short and it took 7 hrs for them to groom him. I question why they had cut his coat so short and they just replied that he had mats, which was a lie.  I provided a picture of how I wanted it cut and even asked if they could do it, they say yes. Now my dog is sad, I hope he does not gets sick.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It was my first time that I took my puppy, they cut his hair very badly and some of them left him big hair, his nails did not even touch it and they charged me dearly 😒

<Review>My dog, Bailey, absolutely loves going to Camp Bow Wow! He's an older dog, in his golden years, and I want him to enjoy as much play and socialization as he can. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful in any way they can be. I've had to drop him off unexpectedly a few times and they've always accommodated me. The pricing is fair and money well-spent. The staff adore Bailey and I feel good knowing he's being taken care of whether it's for a day or when I'm traveling away from home.< /Review>< time>

<review>My two dogs have been enjoying Camp Bow Wow in Livermore for years. They absolutely love going there, whether for doggy day care or for boarding. On my busy work from home days it’s nice to take them there so they can burn off excess energy and not be bored at home. They always come home happy and tired - ready for a nice quiet evening cuddling with me. The staff at Camp has always been very friendly and professional and they obviously do love dogs. It’s so nice to have a place I can leave my dogs without any guilt because I know they’re happy there!<//review>< Time>

Rambo loves Camp BowWow! He is so excited every time he goes there. The staff is super professional, responsible and takes care of the dogs. Rambo goes for daycare at least once a week and we always board him there when we are out of town. They follow all our instructions, we don’t worry about him being alone in the house and bored and he is having a blast with his furry and human friends. Thank you for taking care of our pup!! ❤️❤️❤️<//Text>

<review>Love the staff and my 7-year old German Shepherd was not hesitant about returning.  She eagerly headed for the front door.  That has not always been our experience with other boarding facilities.  Great hours for drop-off and pick-up.< /review><GmapID>0x808fe0d288dd5039:0x7c7eef87d1705779</GmapID>< name>

<Review>The office staff warmly greets our dog and me as soon as we walk in the door. They love our dog. The place is always clean without a “dog” smell, even when they are full. And I love being able to watch Zeus on the camera, having fun with is dog friends.  I don’t have to wonder what he’s doing...I can see what he’s up to! Knowing Zeus is out in a big area socializing with other dogs, rather than cooped up in a small area by himself, or being home alone, makes me able to enjoy my time away even more, knowing that he’s in capable, caring hands.</Review>< time>

Too noisy and overwhelming for my small dog.  We went in just to see the set up and it is basically a large room of dogs.  The small dogs were in a separate space created by office divider walls.  When the dogs jumped up or barked the staff sprayed them with a water bottle.  The staff appeared very kind and did give me some leads on 'in-home' services.  It looks like it would be fine for an outgoing or larger dog who enjoyed interacting with other dogs quite a bit.<//text>

Everyone is always so friendly when checking in/out, and I know my pup is always well taken care of here, which is a great relief when travelling.

Camp Bow Wow is wonderful.  The staff is fantastic with our dog.  She has been going there for about 8 years.  We can call at any time to check on her or go online and see her playing with the other dog.  Danielle particularly is great and Chloe loves her so much she wants to spend her time with her no matter what room she is in.  The staff keeps us informed if they are running low on her food, etc   We would recommend Camp Bow Wow to anyone.  I love the care Chloe gets and carry business cards to hand out for those who ask about pet care< /text>

<text>I always use Camp Bow Wow  for overnights - if I say "bow wow" my dog goes nuts (in a good way.)  One time I chose a cheaper kennel in Livermore - but they charged extra for "play time" - really?  At Bow Wow, my dog plays all day long. I think the only downside is I believe there are hours where there is no staff on the premises and that makes me a little nervous. Otherwise, great place.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>We love the friendly staff at Camp Bow Wow in Livermore. Our dog, Tango, is always greeted with such warm smiles and hugs. Tango can't stop wagging her entire body when she sees the awesome team of at the front desk. Heck, Tango gives them more wags and doggy kisses then she gives me. :)) We appreciate that Tango is treated so well and that she loves to come back time and time again.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Not much wears out a 100lb, 10 month old doberman puppy, but Camp Bow Wow did.  I have been hesitant to take him to a dog park because of his size and felt that we should try him in a closed environment with multiple other dogs.  He had the time of his life, I didn’t get much work done for watching him in the cameras having such a good time.  He was exhausted for 2 days.  So glad to have Camp Bow Wow right down the street.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Camp Bow Wow Tri-Valley is amazing! They always go above and beyond to help accommodate with my busy schedule, and they are always so friendly! My dogs just LOVE going there! The employees give them so much love and attention while they are there playing with their fury friends! The facilities are always clean, and safe, and I never have to worry about my fur-babies when they are there as I know they are in good, caring hands! When I have to travel for work they let my dogs share a cabin, they put their blanket from home in with them, and they always make sure they get a treat before bed!< /Review>< Pics>

She thinks about the dogs, the owners, the schedule, where the dogs will sleep, etc. etc. I found her to be fabulous. She is the reason I left my dogs at Camp Bow Wow. I also like the facilities. They feel clean and professional, unlike several other kennels I checked out.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Our dog, Milo had not been boarded before; he enjoyed his interview day and his overnight stay. He loves other dogs and this is the best experience for him. He's looking forward to his Valentine retreat coming up.
Thank you to the great care from your staff.<//Text>

<text>As soon as we walked in to Camp Bow Wow in Livermore, I was instantly impressed and excited for our pup to play all day and stay the weekend! I love the fact that they have cameras so you can always check in and see your dog playing with the others. The staff is very loving and sweet with your pup and are also very knowledgeable about the vaccinations required... TO TOP IT OFF the interior decor is so stinkin' cute. You feel like you are dropping your fur baby off at an away camp with cabins and s'mores!<//text>< pictures>

I have taken my dog here a couple times and he loves it.  Watching on their on line cams is great.  I can see him play and how he interacts with the other dogs.  Everytime I pick him up he is so tired, which is a good thing.  I found the facility clean and well maintained.  The staff truly seem to enjoy their work and the dogs.  I thought the down (kennel) time a bit long but watching them play I can see how they need it.
The initial interview is a great idea.  Lets the staff, the dogs and owners make sure the dogs fit in and can enjoy it.</review>

My fiance and I love Camp Bow Wow. Our 1 year old labrador retriever  Ella loves going to camp. My fiance and I both work full time and we take Ella to dog day care at Camp Bow Wow twice a week. We also have boarded Ella while out of town on vacation. Ella absolutely loves camp and comes home exhausted for the next 24 hours. Day care is perfect for her because she is extremely social, high energy, and active. We love that we can check in and watch her from the camp cameras and see how she is doing. Every time we drop Ella off, all of the camp counselors are so friendly. We enjoy hearing about Ella's day and sometimes they even prepare "report cards" for Ella. It's so cute. We are thankful to have Camp Bow Wow nearby in Livermore!< /Text>

Here are the things I LOVE about Camp Bow Wow: Open 7 days a week. They provide single day daycare with ample playtime and/or overnight stays. The folks that work there are super accommodating and very friendly. They will provide extra care to dogs that need it (ie: dogs that need extra support due to physical ailments or post surgery, etc.). They will administer special dietary instructions. They have video camera's in the play areas so you can check in to see your dog. My dogs love interacting with the other dogs during playtime, and it's good for their socialization.< /review>

<Text>I only visited for our dog's interview but plan on using Camp Bow Wow when we are away. The person who gave us a tour of the facility was very knowledgable about the business and understanding of and addressed our concerns about leaving a small dog with so many other dogs. She took time to show us every aspect of the dogs' time spent at camp. The facility was clean, the business arrangement was explained fully, and the dogs all seemed happy and comfortable in the surroundings. I also liked the fact that there are no additional charges to the basic fee.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<resp>None< /resp><username>AussieSheltieLife !</username><review>Ok - so, I want to stay here! This place is a blast for your beloved furry family member(s). Upon entering the facility, it is very cleverly designed, like a "camp". It is bright, organized and very clean! The office staff is professional, super friendly, and they will take you on a tour of the entire facility.
Your pampered pooch gets a "cabin" to themselves. For multiple pets, they get to stay  together at night, mealtimes, and there are 2 nap times, during the course of the day. In the "cabins", each camper has their own raised cot - of sturdy design, made with canvas and PVC piping. You can bring your own pups bedding if you want.
During the day, smaller dogs are put together in a large enclosure. Larger dogs are together, in other large enclosures. They can roam freely, inside and outside to play.
When the dogs are in their playtime enclosures, the employees are constantly washing and cleaning campers cabins.  It was really nice to see, such detailed maintenance and cleaning.
While you are away, log onto their website, or download their app, to watch your pup on live webcams - it's really fun to watch them play, run, and interact.
You can also drop them off for day camping too. Location is perfect, at Vasco /580, on Preston Avenue.<//review>< user_id>

<text>The staff at Camp Bow Wow in Livermore are always very friendly, very professional and very efficient.  My two dogs board there whenever I'm out of town, and my younger dog goes there regularly for day care since she has excess energy to burn.  They both LOVE it there and are very happy to go whenever I take them.  The staff know my dogs and know their personalities and take excellent care of them.  I couldn't be happier.</text>< Pictures>

Our dog stayed there half a dozen times and we loved it. The fact that they have web cams and you can watch the dog is just pure awesome :-)

Update: we've been using them for years and still love them. They had some camera troubles but it seems it is all good now<//Text>

I really like that my dogs can be housed together.  I also really like that they get so much out of kennel time -- so many other places charge for out of kennel time beyond 20 minutes, but at Camp Bow Wow, run around time is the norm and not the exception.< /review>

<Text>We've been using Camp Bow Wow's Day Camp for a year now for our little German Shepherd who needs to get all her energy out. The staff are top-notch and all adore the dogs (every staff member knows the dogs by name and get excited when they arrive in the morning!), our dog gets to spend hours of nonstop fun while we are at work, and they even have the option to get a groom before you pick them up at night. Can't imagine a better day camp experience- leaving Bow Wow is one of the saddest things for us about moving away from Livermore!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

Very unprofessional. First, I called them to confirm what shots were required, and my dog, Shar, had all the required shots. Then when I arrive they inform me that an optional shot--the k9 influenza shot--is actually required.

Now, that's not the end of the world but they should have informed me ahead of time. Since I was leaving in two weeks, I was going to have a difficult time getting the shot taken care of before her intake day.

But I was lucky enough to be able to get a shot that day. I called CampBowWow and they told me that Shar would have to have the shot in her system for 7 days (again not explained to me when I went into the camp earlier). Again, this was still lucky because I had two weeks. They told me I needed it in her system before the interview process. Ok that's fine. I called to confirm everything. And over and over again I confirmed the dates that I was leaving. The whole point of gong through this process is that I am on a trip at certain dates and need it confirmed.

They kept saying everything was fine and to bring her in for the interview. I brought her in and the receptionist would not tell me if the dates I needed were available. They said they could only tell me at the end of the day after the interview. I pushed and pushed and finally they said that those dates were unavailable!

Waste of time! Very unprofessional. All they needed to do was inform me of the times.

The camp itself seems nice. But the staff and the organization is extremely unprofessional and they don't care if they waste your time.<//text>

< Review>
My standard poodle, Millie, loves Camp Bow Wow and even knows when she gets on the road in the car where she's going and starts getting excited.  I especially was impressed during her last visit of seven days as she had a very serious condition and needed medication morning and evening.  The staff was vey calm and wrote everything down to make sure she received the correct dosage.  It was really very important and they did such a tremendous job. They always take great care of the campers as if they are their own loved animals.  I couldn't recommend them more.  We've been going to them for years.<//Review>

<review>Our shy rescue dog has learned how to be more social with other pups and we can tell that she enjoys her day boarding visits here about once a week.  We were thrilled to learn that she actually took some initiative and stepped up to make an interview doggie fell at home.
We like the way the "counselors" let us know how our vamper does each time we come to take her home.</review><pics>None<//pics>< name>

My 2 Labs are career changes from Guide Dogs for the Blind, and our German Shepherd is a tri-pawed rescue.  They've only been a couple of times but couldn't wait to get in the door on their second visit.  One of my Labs is a bit more timid in new environments and stayed close to the staff for the first hour or so, but they were great about reassuring her and after a while she did just fine and played with the other dogs.  All of them came home happy and tired.  While my friends and I usually trade off puppy sitting, it's nice to have a place for them to go where they're happy and comfortable when that isn't possible.  That only thing that could make it better is if it were on a ranch with indoor sleeping areas and outdoor runs for all them.< /text>

Good dog hotel and my dogs love it so much . The only thing I am concerning is that if Camp Bow Wow can give us a details how our dogs doing and how they were eating and playing as dogs cannot tell us about these. My dogs lost weight every time when they were in Camp Bow Wow so that is why I am not sure how they are eating and sleeping etc...< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Love the way our dogs are treated. They love coming to Camp, so they are telling us, their experience at Camp is a good one. They are always recognized by your employees, and treated like they are special, which they are to us!!. They come home tired and useless for about 2 days, which tells us they had a very good time partying at Camp. Whether they have a bath before coming home or not, they never come home smelling like they have been in a kennel. That tells us they are in a clean environment. They received their medications and that is also important to us. We are always at ease when our "girls" are at Camp Bow Wow. We truly appreciate your service and good care. It's fun watching them on Camp's website. Just wish the pictures were larger. However, this last trip we were in Twain Harte and missing our girls. We got to see them playing on the web cam. It was great. Thanks so much for treating Sierra and Dixie Ambrosino like they were your own dogs. They are ver y special to us and we truly appreciate the good care they receive.<//text><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808fe0d288dd5039:0x7c7eef87d1705779<//Gmap_id>< userid>

Our 2nd rescued Great Pyr, Socrates, was extremely shy and would not eat (or poop) at our first kennel.  We moved him to Camp Bow Wow when they started up in Livermore and were extremely pleased that he responded so well to the individual care, hand feeding (necessary...), and supervised group play.  We are now on our third rescued Pyr.  You can be sure that Bear enjoys Camp Bow Wow.  The most remarkable thing is the instant recognition and joy the "camp counselors" have with the dogs, even when we meet them after work at Livermore's Robertson Park dog park.</text>

Sonny Boy would prefer to play at full speed around the clock, so Camp Bow Wow Tri-Valley helps us tremendously. A couple of full day play sessions a week with his "friends" most importantly gives him a safe and monitored opportunity to burn his crazy energy, but also gives us hours to take late classes/work late/go out to dinner without worrying about him and, considering his age and energy level, any possible destruction that comes from him being hyper and at home alone.  He typically comes home, makes a lap around the house, and heads for his bed. He absolutely loves it, and we love that he has played so hard that day that he is happily ready to rest when we get him home. The effects of that level of exercise for him reach well into the next day.

The staff there is really great, and understand that Sonny is a handful. When we pick him up and ask the front desk person (usually Brandy or Francesca) how his day went, they unfailingly know with whom he had been playing, if he needed any "timeouts" to cool his jets, etc.

Sign up for a tour and their new camper interview. You won't be sorry.< /text>

I always do my reservations online or even a simple call and what I like the abut this I may add they don't take any dog in you're dog has to go in to have a ....interview Awsomme
I would not hesitate to recommend them to any other of my friends it's is as it gets vuf vuf<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My dog came home very tired which tells me she was very active throughout the day. She came home very stinky though. So much so she needed a bath. Cannot pinpoint the odor.<//Review>

<text>This is the spot to get that fade done just right. I've been coming here since 09 and I don't have anything against the place. Friendly service and they get the cuts done the way it should be. The have good sports channels here too. My brothers and friends come to the Hair-Zone for their hair cuts. I do recommend the location in the hood. Tell them ToNY DEE sent you.</text>< Resp>

Solid cuts, nice people. Great for a quick trim during work if you work in the area. They have lots of Hair-Zone and almost never a wait.</Review>

Everyone here Is a great barber been going for years recently though I've had my haircut botched by this skinny guy with glasses twice, I gave him a second try since he was the only one without clients but never again I'd rather wait. For the $18+ you have to pay here I didn't think you could F up a simple fade with combover since it's really popular but this guy managed to do it twice and he takes forever. And he asks questions like he's the police or my mom not even my mom asks me all these dumb questions. How he has a job here idk I think he's related to someone. But if you go with anyone else except this guy you'll have a good experience.< /Text>

We were easily able to order a large number of pizzas for the next morning for pickup. They were ready and the staff was professional and polite.</Review>

I have been coming to This little caesars location for over 10 years. It is usually a quick visit when I do stop by , unless it is dinner time. The parking is really small though and most of the time it is pretty full.
The 7/11 is convenient you if you need to pick up something or if you have to wait for your pizza order.< /review>

The Greek Salad is bomb! Seasoning Alley hooks it up with lots of feta cheese. The ratio of cheese to the underlying amount of lettuce is perfect.</Review>

<text>The whole hot and ready thing is such a joke. Not once have I ever been here and they've had anything available<//text></record>

< Text>
Ordered online ahead of time and got there and it still took 20 extra minutes for it to be done "hot and ready" not even close this location is always garbage. Workers were in the back not even checking in on the 5 plus people waiting for orders and assistance. I rather drive further because it will still be ready quicker than this location<//Text>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>I wish there was a 1/2 rating because this place seems to always be closed. I am not sure if it has to do anything with Covid-19 hours, but every time I have walked over to this location there's a sign on their door that says "Sorry Closed for Maintenance". How much does it need? I have walked over about 5 times in the last two weeks and it has been closed. I finally call before I head over and no one ever picks up the phone.<//Text>< Pics>

If you order a pizza online it should be ready at the time they promise you. I get there. I am told to wait. 30 minutes after the time my pizza is suppose to be ready, it’s not. On top of all this. I don’t even get the pizza that I paid for. Not such a good experience at this location.< /Text>

Who ever prepared the pizza tonight did an awesome job!! I wish it could always be this way. The perfect amount of tomato sauce, cheese and Pepperoni. Even the cheese pizza was perfect tonight. Most of the time it's either dry, or not enough cheese or only half of the slice of the pizza has sauce,cheese and pepperoni  and the other half is plain crust. It's never consistent.<//review>

<Text>Pretty hard to find a better deal than Little Caesar's $5 for a large pizza. Sometimes there is a wait if a pizza is not immediately available, but it's usually short and the plus side is your pizza will be super fresh. On the downside this particular NH location doesn't seem to have sufficient parking (the tight space is shared with a 7-11, Thai rest, and a cell phone store). However if you can find a spot and are patient, it's a super deal.< /Text>< Pics>

Gave them extra time to prep the food, drove ALL THE WAY there which too 20 minutes, stood in line, and when I got to the counter the guy said he forgot to put the order in, they didn't offer an apology or anything. These people are idiots - they had 1 job and couldn't even do it right. Not to mention the store had a horrible smell and was very dirty when I got there.

Horrible expierence here the cashier at this location wouldn't give a lady who was waiting in line for a very long time her refund!  The lines were getting longer and even one of the people ordering told the cashier to go ahead and assist the lady for her refund and he said no it takes a little longer frustrated the lady and everyone waiting for their order cahsier then went back and got busy and didn't come back, sorry i walked out! I felt bad for the lady waiting for her refund and she was upset i dont know why the cashier was making it hard and didn't just give her money back so people could get going! So weird! No pizza for me tonight! 😒 this location needs a revamp on employees or needs to train better or someone else needs to manage this place better something has to give can't have a pizza place known for pizzas made and ready to go be empty and behind on help or whatever excuse there might be! You would also think the customer is first because without us customers you wouldn't be in business!<//review>

Awesome this is a good pizza place! But, they can make mistakes. At least they lower the price. They are nice to other customers. I only rated 5 so you can see this. I would rate 4 because its not exactly hot n ready you have to wait 20 mins or 10 mins sometimes ( only for special pizza's: DEEP! DEEP! DISH, Meat Lovers, ect; ) .If you call say it clearly and make it so they can understand what your saying.<//text>

<Review>This lil ceasars sucks!!! They NEVER have pizza ready & when making it anyway they charge more to go easy on sauce!!! Go to ANY LIL CEASARS BUT THIS 1!!! They told me if I expect it ready I need to call & order it which costs $2 more.... Why have hot & ready if u don't have it & u charge me more for expecting it!!!!</Review></record>

NOOOO NOOO Do not go. The renting process was nice and the girl who processed it was very helpful. I stayed longer than I hoped, so 6 months into it the sent me a contract and upped my rental fee. I did not agree with it so requested to cancel, and Chris would not allow since it was 9 days till end and they “appreciate” 10. I discussed my unhappiness with it and he was beyond arrogant and rude. He treated me horrible. I immediately put my request in to cancel following month. I expressed my unhappiness with two other associates who said I could have canceled.  Fast forward I am cleaning out my storage to move and so much of my stuff is chewed by rats and damages. As I walk past other units moving I see grounds covered in poop and shavings from rats. I informed the associate of the rats and they clearly all knew about them. You would think the money they make on the many many units there and the changing of fees they should be able to control rats. I was absolutely disgusted. The reason I paid for a storage was to avoid the stuff I need for my events to get any damage in a shed. Due to health and safety reasons I have had to trash it all and will have to replace.  Will be filing to have them replace the money I spent to replace everything, the damaged items and rent. I solely rented there to keep my company and items safe.

***2 NEW points - notice the owners reply below. Complete lack of concern or the money and damages. They know there are rats and his reply below shows how little they care. I am filing a case against them for damages and extensive money owed.
Also - when you sign up they ask you to review them right then and there, and wait till done. So you don’t know truly what you are reviewing. DON’T DO IT.</text>

It’s always very clean and the prices are affordable and secure. I was able to get a first floor unit, verses the upstairs unit I had at Uhaul. They have an elevator if you do get an upstairs unit.
The staff is always friendly, and have storage supplies to purchase if needed. Great storage place!!😊< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>Herme I just met at SMART STOP self storage in Garden Grove and she’s been great I’ve just rented a 10 x 25 indoor storage unit the first month and a half off and it’s a beautiful facility Very clean very safe it’s gated she was just great showing me how to get in and out of the units when they’re open security it’s a definite reasonable price with everything that’s been going on and I would rate herself and her a office partner Alex five stars all the way around and I have been storing things in many places from Colorado through California alreary.</Review><user>113499626787738734842< /user><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

I did a majority of the paperwork online, which was very convenient. Extremely courteous and friendly. Anything that could have been confusing was explained clearly by Chris.  Quickly and efficiently went through the leasing agreement and terms with me, a true professional!🌟⭐🌟⭐🌟< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

The storage space is well maintained and clean. The manager is very professional and efficient.  I would recommend SmartStop Self Storage to my friends and colleagues if they need a storage space.<//review>

<Review>At first they had really long gate access hours and really reasonable prices. The rent goes up very often and the gate hours have gone down and down- 4pm on Sat? 2pm on Sunday? When do you think people need access to their storage/are moving? On the WEEKEND! 6pm weekdays- how could I possibly stop by after work? You charge us more for less access?</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1606933229940, 'text': 'Hi Jen Doll, thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent experience.

<Text>I have had a storage unit (10x10) for many years with SmartStop. The location is clean and the staff (Chris), friendly, informative and takes their time to explain all of the storage units sizes and price. I added another unit (4x10) today (September 4, 2020), and the process went smoothly. Price is reasonable and the storage location is convenient to my new home. Keep up the good work.< /Text>< Time>

I'm very pleased with this outfit. Reasonable prices, good location,very clean. The two employees that I have dealt with ( Alex & Ermey) were both friendly helpful to me.Outstanding job you guys. The only
downside is that the gate access should be later then 6pm.< /Text>

First of all I want to say I have dealt with many storage places in my past. This location and this particular storage place is fantastic, clean, the people are so kind and helpful! I also love the way the security works here, you definitely feel secure and one more thing the price:-) I’m just so happy with this choice…

After misrepresenting the size of storage and forcing customer to take their so called protective plan For $11/month and charging $25 administration fee and forcing customer to bring their locks to show here in order to to sell their locks'. we ask for a dally . Ms. Morales said i need your driver license to give you one . I said i need 2 dallies she said you need 2 driver licenses to get 2 dallies. Because customers are stealing our dallies. we did not believe the size of storage she said it dose not have to be exact  then after all of these time she has waisted she said if you not like it I will refund your money in a very rough way. we found out it takes 5 days to get our money to credited to our account .  They have cost me money and time. please stay away from nightmare. yesterday she came outside and pushing me give her 5 stars on her her phone. unreal.<//text>

My father and mother got a storage unit in Stanton about 1 year ago. My parents kept all their valuables ion that unit because they assumed it would be safe, after all the smart stop self storage website does nothing but constantly remind you of how safe, well lit, and we'll protected there facility is. It's all a 100% lie. The storage unit my parents be had been keeping all theirs most prized possessions was broken into and completely emptied. It's been heartbreaking watching my parents go through this incredible hardship. The worst part about this whole situation is that when we alerted the staff to the break in they acted as if it happens all the time and there's nothing they can do about it. The incident occurred 3 days ago and we're still awaiting a phone call from someone at smart stop so we can resolve this matter. I have never in my life been treated so poorly. I simply wanted to post this story to warn anybody that might be looking for a storage facility to steer clear of smart stop self storage because your things will get stolen and when they do get stolen not a single person from the company will contact you to remedy the situation< /text>

This storage facility is great. The units are indoors, well kept, clean and professional.
My move in experience was awesome. The process and the employees were wonderful. Cathy was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, answering all (and I had a lot) of my questions. I highly recommend coming here for your storage needs!< /text>

<text>Definitely happy to be leaving this place. They have increased our rent close to $100 since we moved in there in 2018. It was good when we moved in, now the place is FULL of drug users and homeless. I have found used needles in the hallways before and an employee has said she finds them on a regular basis. You have to have the restroom unlocked for you by management because the homeless and druggies use is and destroy it (the manager told me not to mind the burn marks on the sink and toilet, she had caught someone smoking meth).  I would not come back to this place. They do not care who they rent to, it shows because of all the trash and drug paraphnalia left all over the property. They also changed the gates hours without any notification so what they have posted is not what the actual hours are.< /text>< gmap_id>

I love this storage, It's like very clean. Also there's an restroom. I like that I'm able to get into my unit, until 10 at night. Have to be out of my unit  before 10 to not get locked  in. The staff is very polite and nice. When I first got my unit, Chris Padilla was very helpful,  explained everything to me asked if I had any questions for him. I really appreciate all his help.<//Review>

Great prices and nice facility. On move in day we arrived after the time they normally do new rental agreements but the store manager, Conner, was accommodating and allowed it. Cathy was great! She showed us our unit and did the paperwork. She made sure we understood everything and liked our unit. Glad we chose this facility.<//review>

I worked with Cathy at you Garden Grove, CA storage. Cathy made me feel comfortable and welcomed. Thank you for hiring Cathy as she helped me make my decision easy and well thought out. 5 star

However, when I started to use the number 1 elevator was broken and caused us to use number 2 elevator. A big time waster. The guys in the front desk were more interested in sharing their pictures on their phone. Then being responsive. They even said to me, "wait I need to show their phone image."Rather than helping their customers. 1 star for the guys at the front desk on February 18, 2019 at 1 pm to 3 pm. Pretty sad image to all your customers.</Text>

My experience here was so pleasant ! Every time I come in Cathy greets me with so much joy and it honestly makes my day. Renting here is so much better than most places I’ve been too. I will definitely be storing my things here for a while. The property is kept very clean, I actively see Juan cleaning and the facility, as well as the office, is always fresh and smelling good ! Great service, definitely recommend. They actually like their jobs and therefore give extraordinary service</text>

<text>My wife and I needed a smal storage unit for our excess home items. We found SmartStop Self Storage and spoke with Kathy. She made our choice very easy to choose SmartStop. She was very professional and honest. She made us laugh and we really enjoyed our little tour of the facility. She was straight forward and didn’t beat around the bush. She was also very personable and cared about what our needs were. I would definitely recommend this storage facility and please speak to Kathy she makes it a very painless process.

SmartStop is one of the best storage company's I've dealt with past few years. Conor/Connor is one of those Facility/Property Managers, that's easy to deal with and professional. The place is clean and kept up to date. Since it's close by my home, it makes things even easier. What's also great is, I'm paying $50 less a month, for a storage almost double the size than Extra Storage. So far, so good. No complaints other than "The Walkers" that roam around lol but that's everywhere.</text>

Came to check out a storage rental, Cathy helped me out. The property was super clean, given the surrounding area. Cathy showed me all the promotions they had running, instead of just giving me the highest rates and price-gouging me.
She was very friendly and funny as hell! I’ve actually rented from another smart stop, and it wasn’t as nice or pleasant as this location. Fo rilz yo...</Review>

If I had an option I’d put zero stars, the “security” are very rude not only did they yell at me for making a tiny mistake they then start throwing a tantrum when they get called out for their rude and inappropriate disrespectful behavior< /Review>

<Review>This smartstop self storage is run so efficiently, the manager, Juan Garcia, runs the storage facility smoothly and nicely. When I walked into the office it was so clean and smelled nice and clean. I will strongly recommend this storage facility to all my friends and family for their storage needs.< /Review></record>

<review>When we first rent from storage 1 month ago. I did not feel safe and did not like how the facility was being handled. Since Conner started running the place, I feel a lot safer and the facility is a lot cleaner. He about us, his customers, and does his very best to insure our safety and the security of our possessions. He is also very friendly and give wonderful customer service.< /review></record>

< Review>
I had many storages and this one was the worst.  They always had water bottles with urine in them either in elevator or next to stairs,  I actually had to call a handful of times to get them to please throw  the urine away,  after it sat there for weeks. They hardly ever swept the hallways ,(I have video )  of the discussing messy storage. I sprayed  with roach spray everytime I went  to my  storage, everytime I would open my storage there was these cockroaches unusually smaller ones,  running and hiding. My wicker there it had been nibbled on my rats. You can tell with the teeth Mark's. I had told personal and they said they would take care of it. my source of income just stopped and I was 32 days late, they charged me  lien fees $122.00x2 =$244.00 plus late fees $80.00 x 2 =$160.00 plus my storage fee $85.00 x2 $170.00, total of $574.00 is what I had to pay to get back into my storage. I immediately told them i was getting out at the end of the month. They didn't even care I was going thur a funk. My storage now they are clean, nice, does not put a lien on  ones storage until one is late 45 days. The staff not to nice after you have been with then for 3 1/2 years. I was told one day by a staff woman to take down this divider and I said I don't want anyone knowing what I have ( because I found a vodka bottle in my storage) from the homeless that hang out there at night. and the owners had seen onside my storage they  never said nothing to me. She insisted I take it down. And if I didn't I need to move out. And like I was a child , she told me to show it to her when I took the divider down. Honest to god I felt like I was this young child. All I can say when u first move in the associates are wonderful, nice but after a few months they all turn into like they all better than you. One pointer you usually treat other like the way you treat people, with respect and dignity. I did not have this at SmartShop in Garden Grove it's been 5 months and I absolutely love when I chose to go. And it's cheaper, and they rinse your monthly fee every year by only $10.00 SmartShop rinses your monthly fee $25.00 every 6 months. I would really think about renting from this storage . If you do you will see what I mean.<//Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1551109917961, 'text': 'Chris Hohimer, your satisfaction is our top priority.'}< /Resp><Text>Sucks to see a good Polite Fair Honest Manager, Juan Garcia, leave the Garden Grove location. Very helpful and made storing belongings easier than at many other Storage Facilities. Hope Assistant Manager, Cathy Kidwell, continues to bring that helpfulness like she always does right alongside Juan as they we are amazing team together. As for the stand in Management, if they can even be such, this Leo person is completely opposite of management material. He fabricates stories and says things or protrays conversations and information to what he feels things should be and not to reality of actuality. He's childish and very immature for person to hold management position let alone position of any sort of power. He would be the person that's hall monitor and takes title straight to head and starts acting as if he's everything just short if not God himself. He should be taught on how to handle situations and how to tell truth not making up lies and fabrications to his own wishes. As for Marcos District Manager of Inland Empire and Steve General Manager and acting District Manager on somethings as for Rick District Manager is out for personal reasons,  I send mines to Rick and his family, Marcos and Steve are doing best possible giving situation of losing Juan as Property Manager. No bad blood with anything on my part with my eviction. I understand fully how business is business and that's just how business goes nothing personal to it.  Best to all Smart Stop Employees except for Leo who is bad business all around and most definitely should be given boot and replaced.<//Text><Date>1563397869901</Date><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

I have been renting from this establishment for over one year and have never had any problems. The inside of the business is kept extremely clean. I have read some previous reviews and a while back they seem to have a little issue with some tenants just hanging around but that problem was handled almost immediately. I rarely give reviews but feel this place deserves a hood review because any employee I have come in contact with has always gone above and beyond what I needed. I would definately recommend this establishment. Obviously, I have bern here over one year with no problem.</Text>

Just came today to help a friend rent a storage space and Cathy met us with a smile on her face. She helped us out to find the right size and the place is very clean. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone as long as Cathy is there to help out. She has great customer service and funny too. Thanks Cathy!! 👏🏼👌🏻👍🏻😃< /Text>

Been a costumer of smart stop since march and all i can say is hood stuff about them.
The place is always well kept and clean, they are on top of everything. Kathy is super helpful and attentive to costumers needs. They also have a loading dock wich makes it easier to load and unload.</Review>

I want to start off by saying that the facility here needed a lot of improvements when I first moved in 2 months ago.  From cleanup to security. I didn't feel my belongings were in good hands. All of that has changed for better as of late.! Conner has really cleaned the place up. !You can notice a huge difference in the proffessionalism and sincerity of the facility. Were as jade and Britney were less hands on. Conner has an upbeat people person vibe and sincerely seems to want to make it a better customer experience for people who store here!!</review>

Juan helped me and took the time to show me and open up every unit. I was able to use the measuring tape and ensure the size of each unit . I have been shorted a foot here and there in past storage transactions and it was a pleasure having all my questions answered with sugar coating the truth.
The place is well maintained and cleanliness has improved dramatically over the past 6 months. Glad to see smart stop hiring the right people for the job. Cathy is great also as far as managing the facility as a whole goes. She doesn't shy away from awkward or confrontational situations , and she will put her foot down in the name of smart stop rules and regulations. The end result is a safer and cleaner facility , great job staff!</text>

When we first rented a space for our trailer the facility was well maintained and clean. Felt very comfortable with the security cameras and management. Shortly after the management was changed this place turned into a dump. Our trailer was broke into which cost us $400.00 to repair. Management let us change our space closer to the front as the space we had before the cameras did not cover. There is currently a homeless encampment located directly outside the back gate. That would not be a problem but every time we go there to pick up our trailer there are countless homeless walking around the facility and trying to get inside. Last time we were there we had human feces with toilet paper on the ground at the back of our space. We are disgusted that this has become so out of control. I would recommend to anyone to search for another facility. Te security cameras and keypad entry are no added security to us.<//Review>

<time>1561046359233< /time><Review>This facility is overrun with vagrants and drug dealers. The police are dispatched regularly for break-ins and other issues. Do not rent here. Your belongings would not be secure. Management/ownership does nothing to improve the issues. It appears they actually rent to homeless and allow them to live/congregate in the units. Other druggies and thieves piggyback in through the gate after legitimate paying customers and have free reign of the place. The gate codes, security cameras, and staff don't do anything to protect you or your stored items. I never feel safe coming here alone, even in the middle of the day.</Review></record>

<text>First my sign up paperwork had to be redone twice in that process I lost my first month fee and they still have not honored it, next I rented a 10x 5 and  they gave ma 5 x 5 because no 5 x 10 were available they gave me a 7 x 10 in the corner with a low cowling. So nice of them.  Steve the  gm screams and yells at renters ( I have several recordings and witnesses to this) and also allows the employees to do the same.
There is no professionalism and the employees only follow the example of the GN
They restricted my access for holding the gate open for 2 minutes while I went and grabbed my phone and still have it restricted.
When I signed up they said my kid did not need to be on the rental agreement yet I am out of state and the keys are lost and he can't get them to cut our lock Orr and said if he does they will have him arrested. My lock my rent is paid call the police I told him to cut it off.
I am calling corporate offices Monday morning8-12-19  to complain but it is coubtful it will do any good. Seeing I was hung up on twice today when I proved them at fault.
I would strongly recommend everyone stay away from this place until a full change of personally takes place and not with employees from other local sites as they are all like-minded

This is one of the better storage facilities that I have rented from. The prices are reasonable, and the services is OK. The problems are that your screwed if you have to use the restroom as its ALWAYS LOCKED., theres a theft issue going on as well.  I would give them a B+ if I were to give a grade .< /Review>

If there was an option to give negative stars for reviews I would give them -5.! Poor communication skills, poor management, 0 for effort in problem Solving They have no interested in Customer satisfaction. If there’s an issue they don’t care for a solution other than solving it their way witch is CHARGING YOU MORE $$ even when they are at fault. For a “New company” you would expect better and good start, Nothing but headaches and stress has come from them. They have 1 employee covering during business hrs who can’t help with anything when away from desk, lunch, restroom or showing 1 customer a unit or who knows what other reason. Main elevator has been broken for more than half the time, had 2 carts for more than 300 storage units leaving you to wait forever until u can load and unload. Horrible HORRIBLE experience would pay twice as much somewhere else but with a company that hears & listens to customers and works to make and leave US THE CUSTOMER WITH A GOOD EXPERIENCE.<//review>

<Text>First self-storage.
Nice pricing.
Two things I found annoying.
1. There are homeless people and loiterers around.
2. If you go after hours of the office, they always have the open button taken out for the blue gate. Real annoying.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>I needed to find a space for my garage stuff (tools, mfg supplies, household extra’s, etc)!

I’ve never rented a storage place before and I was surprised at what I discovered:
1) High rental cost
2) Limited access hours (M-F 9am-6pm;S-Su 10am-2pm)
3) Dirty and unkept
4) Unsecure units and property
5) Visible maintenance problems
6) A lot of renters that looked like they should be collecting their mail there

What I found at smart shop:
1) reasonable prices 100 for a 7x10
2) Access M-Su 6am-10pm
3) very clean
4) security of property is good and I was informed that I could secure my unit how I liked
5) Problem with 1 of 2 elevators being down
6) Some concerns at first

It’s only been about 3 weeks since I moved my stuff in there and so far it’s been good. I’ll repost if I find that things change.<//Review><username>tom lor< /username><response>{'time': 1553091361620, 'text': 'We appreciate all reviews, and appreciate you giving us the chance to improve by providing us with this feedback.'}<//response><Time>1553049442807<//Time>< pics>

< review>
If I could give this place a negative rating I absolutely would!
Somewhere between December 21st and December 23rd are unit was broken into. Apart of set real units broken into during this period of time. All of our children’s Christmas presents were stolen, along with multiple items TVs, tools, even my clothes etc!! The girls in the office we rude and of no help to us other than telling us we were a few days past our due date of rent ( I was there to pay it and retrieve the presents from our storage as this was 2 days before Christmas) We made a police report & Garden Grove Pd tried to assist but ultimately it was my husband and I who caught a mother and son duo selling my children’s USED school backpacks on offer up & the low life was wearing my clothing!
Cut to dealing with this facility. No one followed up with us about the burglary. Not ONE PERSON! I got into contact with the district manager who did nothing! We finally get the insurance number after calling MULTIPLE TIMES and making visits to the location from the new manager (who was helpful but still nothing has been done)
I’ve called this insurance company over 6 times leaving messages in which they state on the message that they will get back to you within one business day! Hasn’t happened! So not only was our children’s Christmas ruined by these drug addict thieves that apparently were living at the storage place but this company does nothing about it. After months of the trying to be reimbursed for our things, I was told today that we didn’t purchase the insurance on the unit??? So I’ve gotten this far with speaking to many people at the facility to now be told we don’t have insurence on the unit and to check with the police department for my reimbursement?? What the hell? That doesn’t even make sense! Bottom line DO NOT RENT FROM THIS PLACE! This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with any company in my life. This WILL BE RECTIFIED!  It’s not the “stuff” that was stolen or destroyed it’s the fact that people took from my kids, cut the lock off and made away with over $900 worth of presents  for our 3 children and I had to explain to a police officer in front of them what they got for Christmas that they wouldn’t open on Christmas Day and I didn’t have the money to replace. It’s disappointing and disgusting how these people have done business. Save yourself the complete disrespect and headache from the bad business they practice.</review>

Its clean!! Except, homeless people hanging out inside the storage. I dont think this place is safe. They cutted my padlock and put a new lock and stole alot of stuff. And yes we do have an insurance but they dont want to pay us.. I HATE THIS PLACE!!! Negative 10 is my rating for them!!!< /Review>

<Text>The manager Connor has done an upstanding job getting this ship back in the water. The new management team ( Connor, Cathy and Jose) are always willing to help their customers. They genuinely care and make you feel welcome even on the worst day. Moving your stuff isnt easy and storing it isnt so great either but these guys have accomidated me with my needs as a customers time and time again. I highly recommend renting at this facility.</Text>< UserId.>
