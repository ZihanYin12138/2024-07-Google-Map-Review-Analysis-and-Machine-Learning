< Review>
Been going to the Carlsbad Joint for about 3 months now, and I have to say Dr. Kayla is the best!  I have been going for chiropractic adjustments for years, and she is great at getting me fine-tuned on every visit. It’s so amazing because her adjustments are so gentle yet productive. I’m just a fan of The Joint (5-yr. member) because I love their format, their different pricing plans, and being able to use ANY Joint location. Shout-out to Dr. Dana at the Oceanside location too!  She’s so good that she’s always busy, but she’s worth the wait. I’m lucky to live so close to each of these locations with these great doctors!<//Review>

I am so happy to have found the Joint in Carlsbad. Dr Kayla is a phenomenal chiropractor. She takes her time to ask questions and really understand what issues I am experiencing every visit. Based on our discussion she will make adjustments appropriate to correct my discomfort. My father, who has been seeing chiropractors his entire life, went to the Joint in Carlsbad when he was visiting from out of town. He came back raving that he had one of the best adjustments ever. I asked where he went and he said Dr Kayla at the Joint. If you are in need of an adjustment I highly recommend Dr Kayla at the Joint in Carlsbad. I truly appreciate what she does for me and her knowledge and skill in chiropractic adjustment.<//review>

<name>Daniel HALE< /name><Text>I just purchased my third full year wellness plan for The Joint. Since I typically get adjusted on a weekly basis this works out very well me.  Besides being affordable, I love the joint because they are there for me 7 days per week. On occasions when I was in pain that was truly a blessing, I recently changed to Carlsbad because I prefer the chiropractors who work there, even though there is another office closer to home. Dr. Kayla runs the Carlsbad office. She is a top notch chiropractor, very professional, and does a great job on the adjustments that work well for me. The other chiropractors who work there are also excellent.<//Text><rating>5< /rating><userid>117309282826793629671<//userid>< gmap_id>

<text>I’ve so loved having the constant of Dr. Kayla’s excellent chiropractic care —and only a couple miles down the road too!  Since 2005 and in the various cities I’ve lived, I came to find that going for regular chiropractic sessions was the best primary health maintenance care for me.  Of the different chiropractors I’ve seen over the years, each has brought countless worthwhile techniques, but it’s not until Dr. Kayla that I’ve achieved such progress with my tight neck. She has a wonderful and efficient technique to relax the neck that gets it to really move and release beautifully. Her treatments have been a wonderful companion to my own efforts to gradually un-do the tension, pain and referral pain of endless years of workstation poor posture, text-neck and the like. And her comprehensive body adjustments definitely get me feeling like bouncing all about after each session.  I’ve been enjoying the monthly membership at The Joint for a few years now - visiting whichever location I was nearest, always finding quality care, no matter who was working; but there’s no doubt I found myself very fortunate when the El Camino Real & Alga location opened — in the magic hands of Dr. Kayla!< /text>< user_id>

<text>I’ve been going to the Joint Chiropractic since I moved to Carlsbad this past summer. It’s been about about 6 months and my weekly trips to visit Dr. Kayla have been a key part of my routine. My fiancé and I typically visit 2-3 times per week and we’ve both experienced a HUGE improvement in our posture, as well as less pain overall.  Over the past several years I’ve been to a variety of chiropractors and I can say confidently that Dr. Kayla is the best I’ve ever been to! She’s an experienced professional - and it shows in her treatments. Each adjustment is personalized specifically to the patient. She listens to what me when I describe my issue areas and then she will target those areas during her adjustments. She is personal and kind to me and my fiancé - you can tell that she really has a connection with each of her patients. We would never consider going elsewhere, although our key cards work at all Joint Chiropractic centers!

**Plus: she even helped my mother when she was in town visiting for a few weeks. My mother was in a traumatic car accident several years ago - so she is always in constant pains with specialized, daily treatments Dr. Kayla was able to have my mom feeling the best she has felt in years!!! Total game changer for my mom. She will be visiting Dr. Kayla whenever she comes to town.**< /text>< Pictures>

Came to Carlsbad area to visit our Daughter.
The 6 hour car trip had aggravated  my lower back and sciatica. My daughter recommended the Joint and thankful they are open on Saturday.
Dr Jason was friendly and professional.
He asked all the right questions and a through physical spinal examination. The Doctor spent some time working on my lower back to get me moving again.  I really liked his technique, and he was able to get me to relax So the adjustment had better chance of working.
I was able to walk out of the office without pain and standing up straight.
I would recommend Dr Jason and The Joint to friends and family.

Love The Joint Carlsbad Doctors! Dr. Terry Brightwell has been treating me since February 2020. I could barely get out of the car without pain in my hip and now I can walk 2 miles and I'm just getting started. Dr. Kayla Biewer has also been treating me and she is great too. These two are the best. Professional, knowledgeable and friendly! These are the only chiropractors that can get my joints to move!< /Text>

I have been going to Dr. Kayla for almost a year now and she is hands down the best chiropractor that I have been to! I have been receiving chiropractic care for over 10 years now and am so thankful that I’ve found a doctor that I can trust. I see Dr. Kayla one to two times a week and she is always energetic and happy and genuinely cares about my well being. She also remembers what is going on with my health which is a huge plus because a lot of docs have you in and out without any recollection of your health history. I highly recommend Dr. Kayla for all of your needs, whether you’re in pain or just need to maintain your health!< /text>

I have been seeing a chiropractor, for at least 20 years once a week. I was sad to learn 3 years ago, my chiropractor of 13 years was moving to Colorado. That is when I found The Joint . It took me a year or so to find the right match. I am so grateful I found Dr. Kayla. She is so thorough , caring and experienced. I'm not sure what I would do if she left, I probably would not continue with The Joint. She is invaluable to this company :)< /Review>

Dr Kayla is the BEST!!! I’ve been going to The Joint at various locations over the last 5 years to maintain good spinal health. I’ve been going to this location for over a year now because of Dr Kayla. She is very thorough, precise, and consistent. I hope she’ll stay here as long as possible.</text>

I come in about once per week to see Dr. Kayla for my adjustments. (I was in an accident about 4 years ago that left me with a stiff/painful neck.) Dr. Kayla does an amazing job of adjusting my body every week and I trust her to adjust my neck, which is the most important part of my adjustment. She is VERY confident, knowledgeable, and skilled. When I see her regularly for my weekly adjustments, I generally don’t have aching neck pain and stiffness which has really improved my quality of life!!

All u can say is the Chiropractor, Kayla Biewer is amazing!  She listens to exactly what I need. She gets my neck to move, when it’s locked up and finds my problem areas,  sometimes even b 4 I tell her.  The front staff is great, too.  Cleaning and sterilizing between each patient really makes you feel safe. I highly recommend this “Joint”!< /review>

<text>After suffering with lower back pain for over 6 months I went to my local The Joint.  I got immediate relief after one visit. After 4 visits I am not only 100% pain free but I feel reinvigorated all over. I’m 66 years old and I’m working out like I was 20 years ago. I’m able to lift as much as ever! And I’m pain free.</text>< Pics>

Overall I enjoyed the weekday doctor and didn’t care for the the weekend guy. I have found better care with a different chiropractor though. The front desk girl who signed me up initially wasn’t transparent regarding the month to month aspect, which is unfortunate. I had  been led to believe payments would just stop. I was reimbursed for May, but they refused to reimburse me for April. Between not getting ahold of them on the phone or being local to deal with this in person in April, it honestly just felt like they took advantage during such an uneasy time. I hadn’t used the membership since March. But whatever. Not a bad place.</text>

<Review>I’ve been going here for months now for general wellness and contribute my regular adjustments to feeling light & energized. I never got into chiropractic work before due to cost and time but the joint has worked out perfectly since I can pop in before grocery shopping without an appointment or any wait time. I also really like Dr.Kayla!<//Review>< Time>

They deliver what they promise which makes them honest.  I go for quick convenient adjustments.  The  hours of availability is where it shines with this place given my busy schedule.  If there's an issue outside the scope of what they are capable of they are not afraid to refer you to another specialist.  They won't try to upsell  you and promise to deliver what they are not capable of doing. 👍< /text>

I've been going to The Joint locations for several years, and at the time of my visit I was with family from Florida in a vacation rental nearby. Seeing as the location I typically go to was about an hour away, I figured that going here would be fine. But yet it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, the actual crack here was quite alright, but the attitude I received from James on my visit was quite frankly unacceptable. I do not plan on returning to this location.<//text>

This was my first time at the Carlsbad location, Dr Kayla and her entire staff were very attentive and friendly. Even when an altered member rudely tried to “cut the queue” they remained professional and courteous the entire time. Way to rise above and remain level headed. Would definitely recommend this location, good hands all around. ;)</Review>

I love  this location! Been coming since they opened.  Jason Vanderford is my favorite. I like his direct pressure adjustments they help my chronic pain. I don't like the "hug" method, but it is available here along with adjustment of ankles, neck, and hips for a complete "tune-up"< /review>

Love this place! The front staff are always friendly and welcoming.
The pricing is wonderful.  I am able to take  my whole family. ($69/month adult, $39 for kids, and military discounts). This is by far the best price I have ever paid for chiropractic care. The value is far beyond the price we pay.
Dr. Lund is amazing. We followed him here from the Oceanside location. He is so worth the drive... Kind, caring, knowledgeable and amazing at adjustments.
Thank you guys so much and please keep up the good work!<//text>

Have had a great experience so far after four adjustments! Love the quick service, ease of getting in and out, options for service are easy to understand and most of all the team is really nice and very straight forward. I appreciate all of the suggestions and the time spent learning more about my body to provide great solutions for my spine with stretches, workouts and icing.</text>

Wow I’m about to be a grandma and I couldn’t be happier that I feel great all with the help of Dr Kayla .. I’m a retired hygienist with several areas of stiffness from my neck and lower back and I’ve been functioning for awhile now with consistent adjustments ! More importantly not only getting adjusted regularly I feel Im in great hands with Dr Kayla she’s gentle yet firm very knowledgeable and encouraging me to keep moving and being active .. Thank you so much Dr. Kayla I really appreciate you!</Text>

<review>I had the opportunity to see a couple of doctors in the short time since I joined. I have been adjusted by both Dr. Scott Lund and Dr. Kayla Biewer and received amazing results.  I use the Wellness plan that gives me four visits anytime during the month for $69 (and additional visits only cost me $10) and the care and convenience i get is amazing.  Being able to drop by and have pain taken away anytime I need to is an amazing gift.  The initial visit was great too, they took the time to get to know me, give me an exam, and determine the best adjustments for me.  And Deborah, the wellness coordinator, took the time to welcome me and help me figure out the best plan for my future visits.  It's an amazing place!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Messed up my back from a lifting accident which only worsened over time from trying to tough it out. Went here for an adjustment which not only fixed my back, but I learned about what stretches I can do to heal it even more. After the second adjustment my back feels 100% again.</Text><username>Cody Odou</username><gmap_id>0x80dc0d3d52949ed5:0x871563b72473940b< /gmap_id>< Resp>

This is probably the best Korean restaurant in the South Bay. Go to dishes are any of their soups (chicken, seafood, octopus...), fried chicken, egg dish (gaeranmari) and if you like intestines gopchangbokum is awesome.</review>

Authentic Korean fare.
Location is a little easy to miss as its situated front of a drive way that leads into a building...
Ordered beef short ribs and it was wonderful.<//text>

Bland dishes with mostly overcooked rice, some super sour pickled veggies, and a few slivers of meat. The bibimbap was pre-cooked and pre-stirred, unlike the typical bibimbap - it was like a cheap version of fried rice made from old leftover rice, discounted pickled veggies, and a token sliver of meat - total waste of money.<//review>

<Text>Came first time in a couple years -- fried chicken and chicken gizzards are still good. Sadly the seafood jeongol isn't as good anymore -- a bit bland. First time trying the monk fish jjim -- this was also pretty bland and was disappointed. All the side dishes are yummy but a bit on the sweet side compared to how normal Korean side dishes are.</Text>< userid>

<Text>I oredered Tteok-jjukkumi-bokkeum, which is stir fried octopus with rice cake and vegetables, and gamja-tang. They are big portions and spicy. Great, and will have many people on weekend.< /Text>< pictures>

One of my go-to Korean restaurants.  The food is great and reasonable in price.  If you're looking for a comfortable after-work hangout place with friends this is a great option.</text>

<Review>Jang Mo Ji's food was pretty average and service was spotty. Came here as a group at around 11pm. We had the tteok-bokki, Korean fried chicken, fried mandu, and seafood pajeon. Only the mandu stood out, because it was crispy and had a well seasoned filling.

The tteok-bokki sauce wasn't spicy or flavorful and the rice cakes themselves we're kind of doughy and room temperature. I feel like I've had better at street food stands in South Korea.

The KFC was crispy and juicy, but the batter was bland. We dipped the chicken into various sauces that came with our other dishes and it made it better, so I'd recommend ordering the fried chicken with sauce.

The seafood pajeon was a major let-down, even though it was fairly crispy. I could barely taste any seafood. It really felt like a rip off. I've eaten pajeon at a bunch of places and they all had at least chunks of squid or some other seafood. The "seafood"  in this pancake seemed like it was whatever scraps was left over.

To top it off, we had to ask for banchan for the table and all we got we're four plates with: seasoned bean sprouts, fish cake in sweet (gochujang?) sauce, young kim chi, and cubed daikon. We didn't get any refill of our waters, so we mainly drank our liter of Hite.

It's a small mom and pop located on the outside corner of a business park. You probably could find it from the streets because of their neon signs, but you wouldn't know what it was initially from just looking at the exterior.

The interior of the restaurant was nothing to write home about, though fairly reminiscent of typical Korean mom and pop restaurants: small, with about 10 tables, and boxes of alcohol stacked up. Orange lighting and a TV on the wall lit the room. It looks like a place that mainly serves Korean locals, though the menu is in English.

We came here because we couldn't get seated at another spot. It's unfortunate that Jang Mo Jip couldn't impress and make us feel positive that leaving the other place was a good decision. The food at here is also kind of pricey, our tab coming to around $80+ total. I probably won't ever come to this restaurant ever again.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>One of the Korean-style "pocha" you can experience in the Bay Area. Yes... it is one of the few Korean street-style tapas drinks and food joint. However, their quality of food has consistently dropped. Very disappointed by their recent Gopchang dish... lifeless and dry beef intestines cooked too spicy. And the place seems to be getting less cleanly day by day.<//Text>< username>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>In A Nutshell:

-I honestly feel like Jang Mo Jip (translates to Mother-in-Law) has the best Korean Fried Chicken in the Silicon Valley.
-They use the traditional Korean batter and frying techniques in addition to using the entire chicken (not just wings/drumsticks).
-The chicken comes out very MOIST, HOT & CRISPY.
-The other dish that stands out here is the japchae.
-When you order it, it comes out very fresh and steamy, you won't waste one glass noodle!

Overall, we like coming here after a late night of gambling (since they stay open late) to celebrate our winnings with great Korean grub.<//text><Response>None< /Response></record>

(Translated by Google) When you ask if one is right while picking up chicken, you answer that one is right. I hope you don't even lie, but I always have my legs, wings, and sides missing. I ordered it 3 times, so I did it all 3 times.

치킨 픽업하면서 한마리 맞냐고 물어보면 한마리 맞다고 대답하시는데요. 거짓말이라도 안하셨으면 좋겠는데 항상 다리, 날개, 옆구리 등이 빠져 있습니다. 저는 3번 시켜서 3번 전부 그랬습니다.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Comfortable Korean restaurant. Thick frozen pork belly with oil salt tastes delicious. Seasoned chicken has been developed so much in Korea these days, so rather than the refined taste of Korean chicken, it's a bit clunky old-fashioned sweet and spicy.
The grilled grilled meat is also excellent. Kimchi stew feels a little fresh but light.

(Original)
편안한 한식집. 두툼한 냉동 삼겹살에 기름 소금 찍어 먹는 맛이 맛깔스럽다. 양념 치킨은 요즘 한국의 치킨이 워낙 발전해서, 한국 치킨의 세련된 맛보다는,약간 투박한 옛날식 달고 매운 맛.
바싹 구이식 불고기도 일품. 김치찌개는 약간 싱거운 느낌이나 담백하다.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5j-5fcJTrO1bcwXHa7tH9-KogltnCsr9QWfDj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLIfCjVYAiBxRtpg0dNl527Wdb2abGBPJw_fsq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfM3NIRqOl-SrDa358ejCQLZUkpid1Vx-JUJrf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<time>1597448278601<//time><rate>5</rate><text>(Translated by Google) The facility was old and looked shabby, so I didn't go there, but once I went to a nearby restaurant to eat dinner at a late hour, it was over at that time. So I couldn't help it with my husband, so I went to a mother-in-law. But contrary to my preconceptions, the food was very delicious. And he was very kind. So, since then, I have often visited my husband. Dakdoritang, kimchi pancake, and barbecue were all the same as hometown. Gyeongsang-do food tasted so I asked, but he said that the person who cooks is Gyeongsang-do. Now my husband and I and my daughter have become fans of the mother-in-law. 😊

시설이 오래되어 초라해 보여서 가지 않았었는데 한번 늦은 시간에 저녁을 먹기 위해 주변 식당을 찾았지만 그 시간에 영영이 끝난 상태였다. 그래서 남편이랑 어쩔수 없어서 장모집을 가게되었다. 그런데 나의 선입견과는 달리 음식이 아주 맛있었다. 그리고 아주 친절했다. 그래서 그때 이후 남편과 자주 찾게 되었다. 닭도리탕, 김치전, 바베큐등 모두 고향의 맛 그대로였다. 경상도 음식 맛이 나서 여쭤 보았는데 음식 하시는 분이 경상도 분이라고 하셨다. 이제 남편과 나 그리고 우리 딸은 장모집의 팬이되었다. 😊<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I tried grilled meat and various stir-fried foods, and the taste was good. There was no big difference from what I actually eat in Korea.
About $45 grilled for each type of pork? I think it was. 4I think it was suitable to eat 2 plates of grilled food + stir-fried food + steamed crab + rice.

(Original)
구워 먹는 고기와 각종 볶음류를 먹어 보았는데, 맛이 괜찮았습니다. 실제 한국에서 먹는 것과 큰 차이가 없었습니다.
각종 돼지 고기 종류 별 구이가 45불정도? 였던 것 같습니다. 4이서 이 구이 2판 + 볶음류 + 찌게 + 밥을 시켜 먹으니 적당했던것 같습니다.< /Review><user_id>112892047367197925774<//user_id><time>1554094823260</time>< Response>

< Review>
This place is awesome. It’s very hard to find fast-ish food that’s clean and organic. Finding a restaurant that’s 100% is near impossible. It has a small menu, but something for everyone and lifestyle. I’m not a big veggie dude, but I could eat here everyday. Their beef and chicken kabobs were killer. The cilantro, lime, and onion sauce they serve with their dishes is also amazing. I know when I see a smaller menu that it helps to keep the quality high and the prices down, and the quality is perfect here. They’re a new restaurant and right off the 5, and the space looks great. If it’s a bit of a drive for you, it’s worth it! We’ll definitely be coming back soon. Give it a try!<//Review>

<Review>Mind-blowing as everyone bite has a delicious, distinct taste! I am utterly blown away by the taste and of course the presentation of the food. I also liked the food because it was not overly sweet. I have a strong preference for savory and vinegar-like foods and this satisfied it! I am really hoping they expand to other places. It is definitely worth the money. 😲❤️< /Review></record>

<time>1598168174808<//time><rate>5</rate><Review>Kabobi Go is an Afghan/California Organic Fusion restaurant.  The food tastes and feels clean:  no premade sauces, all organic ingredients.  Everyone I have referred here has loved the food.  I am working my way down the menu.  So far it's all delicious, but if you want to spoil yourself, try one of the lamb dishes, with (Mom's) Rice Pudding for dessert!< /Review>< Pictures>

Super good, these guys are for real. Everything completely organic is a major plus. Let me say that again, 100% USDA Organic restaurant food. 🤯 Smaller (read: portions that we should actually be eating in a sitting) plate sizes, very reasonable prices, and quite filling. Will be back many many times. Love the vibe of the interior as well.</Review>

<text>This Afghani (i hope i got that right) restaurant is really good and I know that if it were to be located a little closer to Lodi I would frequent the place at least every other week instead of maybe once per quarter or mostly on "special occasions."  I was sad to hear that it is not operating other than for catering during the pandemic, but hope it reopens soon (maybe closer to Lodi :-).  I would also encourage slightly larger portions.</text>< GmapID>

Been wanting to try this place for a while and were finally able to! We had "Mantoo" (see photo) and a veggie kabobi and a beef kabobi. Everything was delicious! The prices were fair for the quality and attention to detail in each plate. And it was the perfect amount of food - none of it left us feeling "heavy" or anything like that. The restaurant itself is extremely clean, welcoming, and modern. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic. Definitely will come back to try more of the menu!<//text>

A hidden gem en route to SF. We loved everything we ordered.  The rice pudding is to die for! It was so good that we ended up ordering it 3 times.< /Text>

<Review>Food is good but the location is all wrong for a place like this. It's in a truck stop location with the intent to draw in a higher standard of people. I don't see this place lasting much longer. If they had a better location they would do better< /Review>< Response>

<Review>What a GEM!!!! Found this amazing place by chance and it made our day!!! The staff is incredibly nice, and the food was maybe the best food I've had in California. Every bite was delicious! We had lunch, along with a fresh made pomegranate juice!! And ordered dinner to go... when we finished the mean we order 2 of the starters we had again to take with us on the road!!!!!

<Text>Delicious! We shared their purple hummus. I had the meatballs and my husband had the signature dish (I can't think of names now). It was all SO good. Flavorful and warm and fresh. Staff was friendly. Food came to us fast. Presentation was pleasing especially for a restaurant where you order at the counter. Price seemed fair considering it's all organic and made in house. If you like good fresh food it's a must try.</Text>< pictures>

<text>One of the most enjoyable dining experiences we have ever had at any level of dining or anywhere in the country.  The food was spiced perfectly and very healthy.  The wine selection was great.  Even after eating and drinking way too much we didn't feel heavy or weighed down which allowed us to keep the evening going for many enjoyable hours.  Our daughter is vegan and they had plenty of food that catered to her tastes as well given that the chef is also vegan.</text>< pictures>

The food melds simple flavors for a finished product that is seamless and complex.

<text>Food was absolutely stellar - I had the potato bolani and the beef kabobs, and the people next to me had the cheesecake by the time I walked in and said it was amazing! Just happened across it, and very glad I did. The food came out rather quickly, and the guys working were super fun to chat with and obviously care about making quality food to share. Definitely a must if you're in the area</text>< Pics>

I still can’t believe that everything on their menu is organic and still more affordable than most restaurants.   It was also such a great experience because I went there with a few friends who all have different dietary needs. One was vegetarian,  one vegan and one who loves meet.    Everyone was able to eat to their hearts content and try all the different flavors.  I’ll be returning next week for sure.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Very high class culinary for a kind of small cafe/fast food kind of place, taste is super premium and fancy, prices seems not high but portions are small, as usual for a fancy food. Overall it totally worth it if you want to taste high class gastronomy.<//Text>

Just good food. It can be really hard to find healthy and delicious options on the road and this was a welcome respite from my Mcflurry filled week.

Green bowl is quite good, I'd recommend for my vegetarian friendly mates. It wasn't as pricey as I'd expect for the quality and service and the chefs are very enthusiastic about the food. I tried a small sample of the rice pudding (pic attached, not sure about actual size) and it was delicious.

Parking is easy and staff are also super friendly. I will probably swing by on my back to SF.</Review>

Excellent food. About time a found a place that serves organic food on the road, as a truck driver it's very hard to find such an organic delicious  restaurant. Probs to the owner for startinf such a business I hope the best for you guys and I will definitely be coming back. No more loves or flying j truck stop food. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Had a piece of chicken and beef kabob with rice and salad. Loved it although the portions could be bigger. I'm not a big eater, still I wasn't full to say. But as an organic joint as this is I still like it. :)<//text>

<Text>The food is amazing and the owner and help are top rate. it's a gourmet take on Afghan street food and by gourmet i mean quailty and presentation, not price. Nothing like it in the area. Yea, the locations not great but once you get inside you forget where your at. The 10 minute trip form Lodi is so worth it. Its about same from Stockton depending on where you are. Tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.
Please give it a shot. You'll be glad you did because If this place go's away it would be a real tragedy. Cheers!</Text>< Time>

It is wonderful to have a completely organic restaurant in Lodi. My husband and I have tried several items and have been very pleased with everything. Having so many vegetarian options is also great, and the Vegetable Kabobi is delicious. We will be back because it is well worth the short drive. The dining room is lovely and the staff and chef are very friendly.< /Review>

<Review>Love this place, the food, and the people. Went this past Sunday and got some food to go. We had the potato bolani, veggie kabobi, and the chicken drumstick kabobi. Everything was delicious. Couldn't wait to go back again Wed. and had the little muchie plate, kabobi green bowl, and my husband had the chicken drumstick kabobi again (he raves about this). Took a friend back tonight for little munchies, potato bolani, veggie kabobi and took meatball kabobi home to hubby. Everything was delicious. Everything is organic so extra special. Chef/Owner and staff are very welcoming. Try it out!<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><Time>1561692167596<//Time><name>Diane Gonzales<//name>< pics>

Delightful customer service, superb quality I could taste. I'm a busy person, I love to cook but I'm busy, and usually have to eat out a lot... But I feel like eeky sometimes afterwards because most restaurants use low quality products or rush the cooking process. I throughly enjoyed my meal, felt great after I ate it. Although I am no longer a local, I will come here when I'm in Lodi with my family again. Also, I support local businesses and start ups a lot! Thanks! :)<//Text>

For all my fellow muslims out there I dont think this place is halal. Asked one of the American worker there if the food was halal and he didnt even know what that was. Also called before that and left a message about if it was halal or not and didn't get a call back. I would give it 0 stars if I could for the lack of communication.< /text>

<Review>Quiet Sunday night dinner.  First time trying Kabobi Go. And first words are delicious. And theres wine and beer! Try one of everything because it's all wonderful fresh ingredients. The red wine Is delish and local !!! The bolani is super yummy. The kabob beef and chicken are delicious . The rice pudding was to die for ! Cant wait to go back and bring my friend's and Try everything. Everyone is very nice and welcoming. Thank you Kabobi Go we needed an awesome Afghani twist !!!</Review><rating>5< /rating></record>

<text>I’ve been schooling here for several months and it’s constantly a brand new, tough work out, however is continually fun and the staff is so motivating.  I honestly look ahead to every elegance I do!  It doesn’t depend in case you’re a high-stage athlete or only a novice. those training classes are for all of us and i’ve made several new buddies from the classes.< /text><date>1615189704468</date><gmap_id>0x80c2b93c0167273b:0xf734dce2bb1b71b9<//gmap_id>< name>

Team Mayweather has definitely gotten me through covid-19 in a healthier way. And it's become my go-to workout these days!! The outdoor classes have been a lifesaver to get in a good sweat and get to see people in a safe, socially distant way!! 💪🏾🥊🙌🏾🖤</review>

New member review: The best place for a 45 min to 1 hour full-body workout in L.A. that incorporates Floyd's own boxing techniques and fight-winning combinations.  Love all of the trainers, helpful and friendly staff, state of the art fitness equipment...can't beat working out in a new gym in the perfect location.  All fitness levels are in my group classes and I enjoy being inspired and working out with TBE, (The Best Ever)!< /text>

The equipment used in this gym was properly sanitized and clean for the courtesy of the next users. The staff will remind you of the dos and don'ts in using the tools. Every corner had a poster for the correct usage of all the things inside the gym.</Review>

<Review>While visiting from Canada for a few months I joined at Mayweather. I loved my experience and I learned a lot.

Dawn & Aaron are amazing coaches, I highly recommend their classes - especially as a beginner.

I made it clear I was only available for a 2 month membership - Oscar made cancelling a seamless experience. Thank you!</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Do NOT get trapped into a membership commitment at this gym. I signed up back in May for a 6-month unlimited membership. I was told at the time that my membership would transfer over to their Irvine location that was opening this fall. I made it clear at the time that I was moving in September and that that would prevent me from a 6-month commitment. Kollins, the owner, assured me that Irvine would be open by then and I could go there. Fine. I signed up for the 6-month and loved attending. The instructors are great. That's the reason this review isn't 1-star. Now September rolls around and the Irvine location isn't going to open any time soon so I try to cancel because I'm moving. I was forced to pay a steep cancellation fee ($100) which I certainly could not afford. I don't blame any of the staff members except the owner, Kollins, who flat out lied to me when I signed up to get me to sign up for a 6-month commitment. I told him repeatedly that I was moving in September and was reassured it wouldn't be an issue. I would've signed up for a month to month or bought class packages otherwise but I was LIED TO. I would've recommended this gym any time before then. Now, everyone needs to STAY AWAY.< /Review>

<Text>The real deal. Awesome people (even after they gain your business,) awesome workouts (that are freaking difficult, but so empowering,) and an awesome facility.

An amazing mix of cardio, strength, and boxing. Not too, too heavy on the boxing, but enough to get a good feel for it and improve technique.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

A gym that tries to scam and take advantage of you I signed up for a month to month contract and they won’t let me out of it after I tried contacting all the managers of this location and the corporate. They lie and try to get you to sign up and try to not get you to look at the contract.< /text>

I don't like anyone here. They only cater to a specific demographic. Its not a friendly environment, and some of the male students give off terrible vibes. Im scared to leave because I lovee the way my body looks. I just think they need to protect the women especially those of us that aren't very strong.<//review>

Even if you don't live in the area, this should be on your radar to stop in! Everyone there was super friendly and the food was amazing. These are the kind of local gems that are tucked away but are well worth the visit, can't wait to eat there again!!</text>

I love this place!!! The food is always amazing, service is great. The owner is almost always there and seems to remember all her customers by name!! They have a free arcade for kids (and adults who are still kids at heart). If you haven't been here, you need to try it out!!!< /Text>

I'm so blessed to have these people right next to us in happy Valley no sense of driving to town for a real Burger when you can have it right next door. They are family owned and they work their hineys off to supply a awesome product nothing like a franchise. Support your local small businesses! these guys rock!<//Review>

Not only is the food fresh and delicious. The staff, is amazing. If your looking for a place for a romantic night, family outing. Or just a quick bite of fantastic food. I recommend this place 1000%.   As a side note here, I want to personally thank this business for stepping up and handing out free meals to fire victims. I will be comming in as much as I can to support this business. A must stop on your travels through our beautiful North state.

2nd stop in and again I am like a kid in a candy store. Such an amazing place so worth the short drive from the freeway or town to be in a great place with great food and amazing  service.<//text>

Love this place. When it first opened I tried it and was not happy. BUT a few months back I decided to give it another try, man am I happy that I did!! Cheesy bacon fries, french dip, awaome burgers and even Cauliflower crust pizza(29 carbs for the whole 12 inch crust)!! Also, has free video arcade for the kids, YES free! Also just found out tonight that they have a painting night every Monday. Just a great place, so glad it is close to my house< /review>

Pibbs is an amazing local family owned and operated restaurant and pizza parlor. The food is just amazing, I've had the pizza ( pepperoni, and all meat ) and there French dip. There pizzas are very reasonable priced and great tasting. The French dip is the best in the redding Anderson area.< /text>

We got a philly cheesesteak, 2 french dips, and a salad and we were all very pleased! The french dip au jus was the best I've had in a really long time and my husband thought the cheesesteak was amazing. We will definitely be ordering from them again soon to try all the other food!</text>< Pics>

<Text>What a fantastic place for a family gathering! Had my 4 year old granddaughters birthday there today. There were 20+ of us. Could not have asked for a better experience. Service was excellent. Food was delicious. Kids were entertained with the free video games and they even put the movie Frozen on one of the big screens. Highly recommended for any gathering! Check this place out!<//Text>< gmap_id>

Overall bad experience, food was not good or worth the money, even after giving them a 2nd chance at ordering from there. Food has no taste to it and it’s all over priced for the quality you get. Never going back and you shouldn’t either!< /review>

Just got home from dinner with my oldest son at PIBBS. We had their pizza.  Top notch in my mind! Each had our own. The staff is great! It’s a family run establishment, and you can feel it. The owners are in house cooking and walking around building relationships with their customers. You know you can always go in and get a smile and warm welcoming. I recommend that you should go in and experience it for yourself.< /review>

Great atmosphere to bring the family. We look forward to trying everything on the menu! Outstanding service. Recommend you take a lovely drive/bike ride out to the valley and get HAPPY!</Text><UserId.>116081348671054980469< /UserId.><rate>5< /rate>< GmapID>

First time visiting PIBBS. The restaurant was clean and inviting. We were greeted immediately and invited to sit wherever we wanted, and directed to the location of the menus. Good selection of burgers and pizzas. I tried the Old Burger (just a burger), that came with fries. It was a good burger. We also had pizza that everyone enjoyed. Friendly staff. Decent prices. Solid four stars in my opinion. When hankering for a burger &fries, I will likely return.
For those who enjoy sports, there are several TVs showing games and a TV for kids entertainment.< /text>

<Text>I've gone there maybe about five to six times now, and the service has always been excellent.  The hamburgers are all I really can give an opinion on, but for the price point I would say that they are very good. And are comparable to the products of places that sell their hamburgers for around 5 to $6 more. I go there with my family at least twice a month, and I have yet to have a bad experience. the only small gripe I have, is that when I order a rare hamburger it usually comes out medium to medium rare. But, I can fully understand that due to the risks of a lawsuit if someone does happen to get food poisoning. It is a good family diner, and does include a small arcade. If you take time to read this, I recommend at least trying the place out. My favorite is the "Heater" a mildly spicy burger with jalepeneos, sirrachia sauce, and pepperjack cheese as it's focus.< /Text><GmapID>0x54d2c39bf94a047f:0x3a69a8e21bbe6adb< /GmapID><username>Nathaniel Hambelton</username><resp>None<//resp><Rate>5</Rate>< userid>

<user_name>Jennifer Bross</user_name><Text>My family and I were in on the evening of Oct 7th (last night). The service was amazing, the food some of the best we’ve had around the area, and the decor was great. I’m so glad we have this out here in HV. The owner, Crystal, took time to be super sweet to my daughter and it was memorable because when asked today what “her friend at PIBBS” name was she happily said, “Ms Crystal!”
Thanks for opening up such a friendly place! We are new to the area and felt so welcomed. It was really nice that there are senior and veteran discounts. My spouse is a veteran and was so surprised by this. We will be back for sure!!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
First Frankie and Evan, and continuing through Justin in 2019, Big City Vapor has never failed to excel in knowledge, helpfulness, and above and beyond service. If you want a poster child for supporting local business and not big box or cut-rate eshops, Big City Vapor proves why a guy behind a counter who gives a damn will always be my first stop.
Thank you and keep being awesome.</Review>

Excellent shop, inventory and most of all  super friendly staff. I mostly buy my gear online these days due to the employees at most places not being great, stale inventory or not having what I want most of the time, on top of rediculous markups. This place is different. Dropped in here just looking and ended up buying a new tank on Justin's recommendation (falcon 2, awesome flavor, buy this tank!) at a great price and couldn't be happier with it. Justin was super helpfull and knowledgeable. To top it off the price on their coils for this tank is the same as online when you factor in shipping, so will be coming here for that now too. I make my own juice, but their selection is so good I will probably come in for that also and try some new flavors for inspiration, since they have really fair prices. Good job Big City Vapor, you got a new customer thanks to being a brick and mortar that can compete with the online vendors on price, with great service to boot.< /Text>

Great shop. Stopped in for the first time today and was really impressed. Walked in to a clean and well put together little shop and was greeted by friendly and helpful staff. Picked up some delicious e juice, had a little bit of pleasant conversation and off we went. 10/10 will be returning on a regular basis</Review>

<Review>I like the store, good selection on vape products. I am pretty loyal when i find a store I like. So i will give them my business. The only thing I wish they could do is at least match the cheaper pricing other stores offer on the same product. But I like the guy, and he is American!<//Review>< resp>

<text>I walked in this place and immediately felt welcomed. Ren was the guy that helped me out. This guy was so helpful and patient with me and made sure that I knew what I was doing with the new Big City Vapor that I got from him. If it's your first time or even curious about vaping this the place to go and get started. I highly recommend this really chill spot.< /text><user_id>113124431642346263815< /user_id>< Response>

<Review>Great customer service,  good prices, knowledgeable staff. This is a small shop that listens to the customers needs, they aren't just trying to make a sale, it's important to them to help people stop smoking, my aunt who smoked for over 40 yrs got the perfect set up and hasn't had a cigarette in 4 months.< /Review><user>108697629305960550592</user><response>None<//response><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

We try to keep our prices competitive with other local shops on top of giving you a free coil when you buy four. Our coils come straight from the manufacturer and unfortunately we have no control over how they are used after they leave the shop which is why we can't guarantee coils but nevertheless we will be happy to offer another free coil if that would help. Feel free to come back and we will go over your device and maybe help figure out what the problem may be. We have never had a whole box of coils be a problem before but there is a first time for everything. Frank or Evan is always there to help if you ever need it.

Great people! Great selection of juices. Had a hard time give y'all a 3 star though. Prices are SKY HIGH! I know CA has high tax's. Your prices are still extreamly high! The Aspire coils all toasted with in 24-36 hours. I compared the carton from my old box and they are completely different. Could be older style boxs idk. I've been using Aspire for a long time and I've never had 5 coils burn out that fast.< /Review>

I like Big City Vapor the staff is very knowledgeable about all the different types of vape systems. They have an awesome selection of vape juices. If you are just now getting into vaping or you're a seasoned professional they are willing to help you. The prices are very reasonable an Big City Vapor is the only vape shop in the north state to have a drive thru.
Thank you for reading my review< /Text>

Great products on hand wether looking for a beginners set up to a more advanced set up they’ve got it ALL and best part is they’ll walk you through it ALL. And the variety of e-juices are thru the roof, AMAZBALLS!!! This is what I LOVE about small “mom&pop” shops they make you feel at home, and that’s exactly what Big City Vape is! Stop by and check them out you won’t regret it!!
I walked in with 1month no “smoking” cold turkey and was ready to go buy a pack, so very glad I stopped here, I haven’t gone and bought that pack, thank you BCV!!< /Review>< user_id>

Worst shop and worst customer service I have ever experienced. They down right are rude and they say they will honor their return policy but that is not true at all, I personally experienced this treatment and I would not reccomend this shop to no one. They r over priced on everything and dont have the best knowledge of their products at all. So save yourself the hassle and go to a different shop. There are definatly way better shops in the area.</Review>

I've been here 2x both times in the evening. Food is really good but the service is terrible. There seems to be only 1 server at night.  Sat at the bar waited for ever a menu and drink. Tonight same story server was in the kitchen complaining while my glass sat empty.  As I was leaving noticed see  changed the sign to close at 8pm when the time states they close at 9pm. Management needs to be there at night.</review>

If i could i would rate this place a zero stars. It is way to salty and greasy. It use to be much better quality. It lost its taste. I order the Shrimp Primavera and they were drowming in butter and the veggies were not fresh. My husband order a posole and 1 hour later got sick. Not worth it never going back.<//review>

(Translated by Google) I will be VERY HONEST, in flavor, my respects in attention to the waitress who touched us mmmm 'let's say what happens the test, but where I do not agree is that we receive a menu with the names of the dishes, but without a description of what brings the dishes, what if someone is allergic to something or they give us a hoot ... they show types of meat which if you ask they tell you that only for that dish they can give you specific meats .. hello ?? If I want a chorizo ​​burrito, bring it to me! In addition, its menu says that Parties of 6 or more mandatory 18% of TIP !! And you go with a family of 3 or 4 and it does not matter, when you receive the bill they already added $ 20 dollars from Tip and they still give you the option of whether you like to give more Tip, wow, we understand that your salary as a waitress is mostly for tips but not abuse! From a dinner of less than $ 100 you leave paying $ 150, for the Sabor I would return but only to take away, since although we are eager to return to eat inside, with this they scare people, good luck in your new Management, but I think there will be many more complaints. Lucky.

(Original)
Seré MUY HONESTO, en sabor, mis respetos en atención la mesera que nos toco mmmm’ digamos qué pasa la prueba, pero donde no estoy de acuerdo es en que recibamos un menú con los nombres de los platillos, pero sin descripción de que trae los platillos, qué tal si alguno es alérgico a algo o nos dan gato por liebre... muestran tipos de carne los cuales si la pides te dicen que solo para ese platillo te lo pueden dar de carnes específicas.. hello?? Si quiero un burrito de chorizo tu tráemelo!, ademas que en su menú dice que Parties de 6 o más obligatorio el 18% de  TIP!! Y tu vas con familia de 3 o 4 y no importa, al recibir la cuenta ya te agregaron $20 dólares de Tip y aún te ponen la opción de si gustas dar más Tip caray, entendemos que su sueldo como mesera es mayormente por propinas pero no abusen! De una cena de menos de $100 sales pagando $150, por el Sabor volvería pero solo para llevar, ya que aunque estemos deseosos de regresar a comer dentro, con esto espantan la gente, suerte en su nuevo Management, pero creo así como yo habrá muchas más quejas. Suerte.</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It was embarrassing for my guests this visit really was not what I expected when I arrived note that there were not many employees after they asked us to sit down and the waitress approached somewhat stressed because apparently a waiter had left and a chef were very late and as we ordered I just saw that they ran from one side to the other a young man put quite distorted music the sound away from pleasant step to be uncomfortable I asked him if he could fix that I don't know maybe lower the bass or the volume after they brought us the Food obviously nothing to do compared to my visits in the past the waitress was very pressured she did what she could really try to do the possible thing but in case I asked for a countrywoman who did not arrive or to cocktail I do not understand what happened with this place was not A pleasant experience.

Fue vergonzoso para mis invitados esta visita de verdad no fue lo q esperaba al llegar observe q no había muchos empleados después nos pidieron q nos sentáramos y se acerco la mesera algo estresada por q al parecer se había ido un mesero y un cocinero andaban muy atrasados y pues igual ordenamos yo solo veía q corrían de un lado para el otro un joven puso musica bastante distorsionado el sonido lejos de placentero paso a ser incómodo le pedi si podría arreglar eso no se tal vez bajar el bass o el volumen después nos trajeron la comida obviamente nada que ver comparado a mis visitas en el pasado la mesera andaba muy presionada ella hacía lo q podía de verdad q intentaban hacer lo posible pero en si pedi una campechana q no llegaba ni a cocktail no entiendo q a pasado con este lugar no fue una grata experiencia .< /Text><userid>108723607541430924373<//userid>< Resp>

If you're actice Military, Reserve, Guard, Retired, etc, look no further for the best accommodations in the area.  Clean,  quiet,  and close to the attractions of Monterey. Prices are much better than downtown and safer.<//review>

I loved my time at the Naval Postgraduate School. I believe that Dean Rich Lyons has a clear vision which inspires key values in staff, faculty, students, alumni, and the general community. The people I worked with at Haas both worked and played hard. I took pride in being a part of a high-functioning team of highly motivated individuals. I felt like I had strong mentors who were very supportive of my own professional development. That said, this is not an organization in which it is easy to move up. Although an employee may show the dedication to work 60 hour weeks for months while only claiming 40, there are no guarantees that a strong work ethic will be rewarded through school awards or promotion.

Pros.
strong work ethic, hard workers, dedication, fun team, diversity in workload, never a dull moment.

Cons.
limited work/life balance, failure to reclassify employees as a result of added responsibility, unrealistically high expectations commensurable to pay grade<//Text>

I attended here and graduated in 2006. It is considered by many to be a death nail in the coffin which is your career - but - it was probably one of the best things I've ever done for myself. No regrets here, only fond memories.</review>

Such a privilege to visit my wife's distinguished alma mater. We made a special trip up the coast to celebrate an important phase of her naval career.
It's an amazing, well maintained campus, reflective of the high standards of America's finest leadership. I am very glad to have visited and would encourage anyone, who has opportunity, to make full use if it.< /text>

Truly a once in a lifetime experience.  I am blessed to have been able to spend almost 2 years here and use things Iearned here every day.  The faculty and facilities were great, NPS foundation and clubs, library, gyms, and Herman Hall/Trident Room exceeded my wildest expectations.   Would do it again in a heartbeat!<//text>

NPS is one of the best shore duty opportunities; don't pass up an opportunity to get orders here. While you are earning your master's degree, you can also complete your JPME Phase I courses, which are very helpful as you are promoted.  I am so happy I have the opportunity to study at NPS!<//text>< pictures>

<Text>I was visiting here in August 2014, the famous postgraduate school, especially on naval studies and security.

The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is a graduate school operated by the United States Navy. Located in Monterey, California, it grants master's degrees, engineer's degrees, and doctoral degrees. Established in 1909, the school also offers research fellowship opportunities at the postdoctoral level through the National Academies' National Research Council research associateship program.

<text>I attended recently in the National Security Affairs department.  The cadre have little in the way of BS mandatory training, and the guest speakers are often excellent.  The professors are professional, knowledgeable, and kind--except for Anne Baylouny; she's a wretched person who possesses none of those qualities.  The librarians are thorough and helpful, except the one male who occasionally works the front desk; if one asks him a question, he reacts with a sigh and floor-gazing while giving you the briefest possible answer, which may or may not be helpful.  Expect your PT to suffer, especially when writing your thesis.  "The best laid plans of mice and men . . . ."  No issues with service rivalry at all, and the foreign students do not impede the classes, generally.  Keep a jacket handy year-round.  If you have small children, you may take them to the parks and beaches for free, but everything else will cost you.  Gilroy Gardens is great for small kids, but it's about an hour away (buy season passes).  DLI is nearby, as well.  Don't give the homeless a damn thing; they're professional bums.  If you own guns, look up the laws first.  Many of your rifles may be illegal in CA.  Also, the weather will rust them out if you're not attentive.  The area is naturally saturated with neo-hippy socialists who make a ton of money.  So, yeah.  They suck.  The school is still top-notch, though.</text>< time>

< Review>
Dr. Purwal was so gentle and kind. Very knowledgeable. All of her staff was the same way. Clean office and updated technology for teeth. Not pushy like some other dentists for extra procedures or dental work. My whole family now has appointments with her. Excellent care!< /Review>

<Text>My first time in, greeted by such wonderful people. I haven’t been to the dentist in ages, and felt nice to walk into a very peaceful place. Everyone was friendly and everything was so smooth and easy. Thank you for restoring my smile and I am happy to find a new permanent dentist!< /Text>< Name>

<date>1619546706875</date><Text>I took the day off to complete as much work as possible as it is very hard to make dental/health appointments during working hours as I work in a Hospital myself. I expressed this to the doctor and let her know I would like to do as much as possible as quickly as possible. I still expected I would not get all of my work done because I needed 5 teeth to be fixed. To my pleasant surprise the doctor spent as much time on me as needed to complete all 5 teeth in one visit! Great experience every visit.< /Text>< Response>

I've said it before and I'll say it again, Dr. Purewal absolutely the best dentist I've ever been to.  Very highly skilled, I doubt there is any procedure she can't do perfectly.  The staff reflects that excellence-caring, friendly and most professional.< /text>

The staff was friendly and helpful. It was my first visit and they fit me in to their busy schedule. I will definitely recommend them to others. They continue to do excellent work. I would recommend them to anyone.

I personally thought the cleanliness was poor,  floor, walls, ceiling etc. Everything seemed dated even the drills in the little box which didn't seem very sterile.  Need to update equipment,  I was spitting/drooling on myself because the suction tube wouldn't suck when abort dentist was also using the machine. (How 3rd world)  And made it seem like my fault for wanting to keep spitting during a cleaning,  needless to say that was my first and last visit.</review>

<text>Great experience. From check-in, to me sitting in the chair, it ran extremely smoothly. Even though there were other patrons there, I felt like I was the only one getting special treatment. That's super important. Super clean place and Covid compliant. Highly recommend this place.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Was having tooth pain during the weekend and left a message to Plaza Dental early Sunday morning. They got back to me later that night to confirm an appointment the following day. I went in and was able to get a root canal that same afternoon. Procedure was painless and the staff was great and super friendly. I also appreciated how the staff texted me the day after the procedure to check up on how I was feeling and to let me know where to reach them if I had any questions or concerns. Will continue coming here for future dental procedures and cleanings</Review>

My teeth have always been something I'm not happy with or proud of, and contribute to a serious decline in my mental health as I know they do for many others.

I always feel so comfortable being in this office. The women here are so kind and empathetic and make an environment that I WANT to come back to. Previous offices have made me feel more upset than I already do about my teeth and I can't say enough how much it means to me that when I come here I am always met with compassion and kindness.

The dentist and entire staff here are great and I'm finally hopeful I can get on top of the issues I've been having.

Thank you to all of the women who make this office such a pleasant place.</review>< Pictures>

Wow, I am such a skeptic when trying to find a NEW dentist. I hate going to the dentist period and have failed so many times in past and always give up or continue with past dentist or quit going....
Today, I was pleased and will go again to Gilroy Plaza Dental. I pray my next visit goes as well as today and I hope my husband agrees once I get him his first appointment. Very pleasant experience today.....<//Review>

Today I finally made time to see a dentist. I chose Gilroy Plaza Dental and was so pleased. The ladies at the front desk were especially  nice and helpful. The doctor spoke clear English which was so important to me due to my hearing problem.
So glad my choice was a good one on my first try.  Nice clean office, virus protection in place and professional staff. My care was better than expected.<//Text>

The ladies at Gilroy Plaza Dental are exceptional. I’ve had really bad experiences at the dentist that have caused me to have great anxiety whenever I step in a dental office. I cannot say enough good things about my experience. Dr. Purewal truly is the sweetest and walked me through the whole procedure with such care. She assured me the entire way. Easiest extraction ever! Never though I’d say that. Most of all, I truly trust her and her staff. Thank you guys so much!<//Text>

<review>Great experience, office waa relaxed and upbeat. Dentist took time to listen carefully & answer all my questions with a positive mood. She was very patient, competent, professional and honest. She went out of her way to make me comfortable and at ease. I'm handicapped and use a walker. Was in for crown work.The staff were polite, prompt and courteous. Easy parking and flexible scheduling. Currently have the temporary crown, no problems with it. I was pleasantly surprised with a very positive experience and highly recommend them.</review>< Pictures>

I have had dental issues since I can remember soft teeth have left me with cavitys found at ever check up, so its fair to say I have had quite a bit of experience with different dentist,assistants and receptionists, the amazing staff at Gilroy dental plaza are absolutely amazing at what they do. They are on top of scheduling and reminders of up coming appointments and very helpful if rescheduling is necessary. The dentist and assistant are the best of their field. They are extremely knolegable, Do great dental work, and are so fast and gental the appointments are done it what feels like no time. As someone who used to hate going to the dentist I can honestly say they've changed my entire outlook on dentistry. Extremely high recommendation from me. Give em a try! You wont be sorry! 5/5< /review>

<Review>I hate going to the dentist in the first place.  But I have found this office and its staff very pleasant in accommodating my needs, making me as comfortable as possible and doing their best to give me good results fast and as painless as possible that dental work can be as well.  One other good feature is that there is adequate parking and you have easy ground floor entry without stairs or elevators to contend, and not once have I heard any crying from old or young patients!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Consistency is important.  I know when I receive treatment from Gilroy Plaza Dental it will be as good, if not better than before.  Great care from walking in the door, sitting in the chair and knowing these people want to provide good service to you.  Even better is when Dr Purewal affirms the work of her staff and I get to hear it.  Great teaching and service. She cares for patients and staff!!!< /review>

It had been a while since I visited a dentist (gross I knowwwwww), but it’s was more out of fear. My previous dentist knew how to calm my nerves and knew how scared I was of the dentist. I just felt comfortable there so after she retired her practice, I just stoped going.
Once I went to Plaza Dental, the girls in the office, first off, were so sweet! Making me feel at ease as I first walked in feeling so intimidated. That quickly went away. The Dental Assistant that helped me, (I forgot her name!) she was so so so sweet! Making me feel super comfortable, making jokes with me. Then the dentist, she was GREAT! Consistently asking me if I was doing good. She was honest with me when it came to pain and was so transparent with every step she was taking. Her and the dental assistant worked so good together. I felt to at ease and so comfortable. I appreciate how well they dealt with my fears.

Sorry I can’t remember any names! I blame my fears!<//Text>

They were near to my new home and the reviews seemed good so decided to make an appointment for a much needed exam and teeth cleaning. Got there and was a tad bit concerned because of the location, but  everyone was super nice and attentive, they took their time to take care of everything. I would highly recommend them if you are looking for a dentist.< /Review>

If you're looking for a dentist or you're not happy where you are presently going, give Dr. Purewal's office a try. You won't be disappointed!< /text>< pics>

<review>A coffee shop for guys. Gorgeous women in bikini serving super strong but tasty coffee (kind of pure dark chocolate roast taste). Outstanding service. Clientele is mostly Asian but as a Latino the girls made me feel very much welcomed and chatted at length with my date and me. Zip the coffee! I am a coffee  drinker and my heart was beating and was wired an hour later. Perfect drink before a long night at the club.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Always get a nice greeting. The "waitresses" are attentive. My iced tea is kept topped off without having to ask. Coffee is strong that it keeps me awake on my 7hr drive north after visiting San Diego. I always take two to go for good measure. But if you're a newbie to Vietnamese coffee I suggest drinking it slow.<//Review>

Not bad but not great either. They messed up 6/8 tacos. Fries were okay. I appreciate that they offer vegan options.</Text>

If you haven't had the crispy chicken epic burrito you're missing out. It's literally one of the best things on the menu. Honestly this del taco is pretty good compared to other ones. They have big portion sizes. I went to a del taco where the epic burrito was the size of a McDonald's sausage burrito and was thoroughly disappointed. This place is much better than that 😁</text>

<text>I love the shrimp taco season! Not sure I'd call them jumbo but they are at least medium count. It is disappointing when the lime wedge is missing. One had it, the other didn't. The lime really makes a difference. I used the app to check in and got a $.99 grilled quesadilla. The quesadilla is so much better being grilled! Totally delicious cheesy goodness.

There was a plastic bag over the drive through speaker and the cashier couldn't hear me clearly (I wasn't even wearing a mask inside my car). She was repeating back the craziest items. I finally gave up and finished the order at the window. Trust me, I am not soft spoken.<//text>< Pics>

I went here on Thursday for the chicken soft taco deal they run every Thursday.  To my disappointment,  I received practically no sauce(about 6),even though I requested a lot for the 30 tacos I ordered and 2 large fries! Furthermore the window attendant was rude as well and they never gave me my 2nd fries nor a receipt!  My husband had to drive all the way back to request the fries and sauce. Since we didn't have the receipt they didn't give the fries at all!? Very disappointed. Hope they do better if we go back.< /Text>

This Del Taco always has great service, little to no wait, and they always get my order correct. They make excellent quesadillas here, and the fries are always fresh. Great job!<//text>

<UserId.>103184395419478977921</UserId.><text>Thought I would help support the local businesses. My wife had the lunch special and she had the Mongolian beef. I had a la carte. I had the family style bean curd and the eggplant with hot garlic sauce. My wife said her dish was good. What you might expect from a mom and pop. My dishes were very good. Lots of eggplant and large pieces of bean curd. I have had the same dishes at other Chinese restaurants that charge more. I would ask them to leave out the chili because those two dishes can be a little spicy if you can't have spicy dishes. Next time I will see how their orange and lemon chicken compare.<//text><rate>3<//rate>< time>

Ordered through Grub Hub. Food arrived ice cold. Beyond tacos came with cheese even though they are specifically labeled vegan. I asked for 8 packets of hot sauce they sent 26. Never again.< /text>

Pretty good food. Unfortunately many places take your order while in the drive thru. Others while take it while outside at the drive thru window. Still don't care the latter</Text>

Their new crunchy chicken taco sucks. The rest of my meal was pretty delicious.  Avocado dipp was fresher than most restraunts out here. Chips were nice and crispy.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I have never given a bad review before, & while I enjoy an occasional burrito from del taco, and especially like that they now serve beyond meat, I was in this area & decided to try this specific location one night via drive-thru and it was an awfully long, unprofessional & annoying experience. First of all I had 3 different people take my order, (two burritos) they were completely slow  w/the service & the one order wasn't completely right. I don't ever plan on ordering from this location again. Save yourself the frustration & time & pick another location.< /text></record>

This location needs better leadership and employees who actually pay attention to the orders, they make a lot of mistakes also the food is almost never hot every time I make a purchase, I wouldn't recommend this location.</Review>

Not a diverse work place and shows through there customer service/ management, customers of color do not receive the same service as everyone else. I witnessed particular customers being asked"please pull forward compared to drive forward" or customers being addressed as "sir or ma'am" compared to me having to ask them not to call me brother- I took my own customer survey from observing/ listing to customers orders in the driveway without employees knowing because of the calling me brother made me curious about the service here.(food is ok, but not an authentic Mexican food place for only certain employees to be able to be employed here🤔) WHAT HAPPENED TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYMENT!!!< /text>

<review>Great Del taco. Ample parking (don’t stop at the lot directly in front of this Del). Staff is very friendly, interior is open, plenty of seating, well lit.

Ordered the #10, which was the Triple Meat macho burrito and fries. Got a cherry coke. The combos here are different than other Del taco locations I’ve been to. Not a bad thing!

Small anecdote: was at a different Del taco location before I came here. It was stuffy, the clientele were cursing each other and threatening physical violence, and the line was out the door. This location is a stark contrast and emblematic of what a Del taco should be.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Went in and got my usual order 4 beyond soft Tacos no cheese no lettuce. I get home and i have 3 no cheese and one with cheese. It looks like they realized while they were doing it but said ehh what heck a little cheese wont hurt. But im allergic to dairy, i could've really gotten sick. Still haven't heard from del taco to make it right. I have them 3 because they were exceptional before covid began<//review><userid>100498284594210382646< /userid>< username>

I have been going to this location for at least 7 years, and for the most part the only issue was the cleanliness of the bathrooms. But I was here recently just to get a strawberry shake for my sister, who was waiting at the bus stop across the street, and a regular fountain soda for me. It took so long for the shake that I almost missed my bus. A couple of people who came in after me got their orders before my sister's shake was ready. The employees, who seemed understaffed, were more focused on the drive-through than on the customers in the store. I was patient and didn't say anything because I didn't want a scene, but I was so frustrated and it made me not want to go back again. Even though my sister loved her strawberry shake.<//text>

The employees are nice. It's always clean in the Dine-in. Restrooms are clean and The Manager is nice. When I order my Ice Coffee it's made right and when I order food it's right. I always come here on the days I work. They are a life saver for me when I have LONG DAYS AT WORK.<//review>

Always gets my order wrong. How is so hard to add sour cream to a burrito. Either they can't read or they don't care about making it correctly. After the 100th time getting my order wrong I don't think I will return.<//text>

<review>Ok place, fast and food freshly made. It's just a little bit dirty, the counter area should be cleaned more often. I don't mind the homeless hanging out there but not close to the counter, it's appetite killing, and not good for business. Love the staff at any hour.< /review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Name>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Never have a bad experience at Del Taco. The only thing I don't like is that they charge for ranch. They are the only fast food place that charges for ranch at least throw it in if you spend more the $20. Should definitely take that into consideration.</review>< pics>

Nice place with nice people, at least every time I go there.

In you want to drive over here there is not a lot of parking, space is very limited.

There's a handful of parking meters in the back.< /Text>

Pretty consistent food over the years, actually very consistent. A burrito back then tastes the same as it does now. even the hot sauce is the same.

I love DelTaco bean and cheese burrito. I shouldn't drink it, but lately I've been indulging in orange soda. Did they change the mild salsa recipe? Not as good.</Text>

Waited,  no answer.  Drove up to the drive-thru window to order. Figured their speaker/mic was not working. I told the lady at the window I wanted to order,  she said I had to drive around and get back in the drive-thru. I asked, "Seriously?" I did not want tacos that bad,  so I left. I mentioned I would leave a negative review before I left.</Review>< pictures>

I'm Sorry but it was the worst experience I've ever had at a drive thru restaurant. Driving for Lyft I pulled up with passengers around 1:30 a.m with only 5 cars ahead of us. While waiting to order and for our food, it took 1hour and 40 minutes to finally pull out of there with our food. I would have pulled out and left but we were stuck in the drive thru line. To top it off, the food was cold and the soft drinks had no flavor. Needs lots of improvements and better food along with better service. Thank You.<//Review>

<Text>As expected, the food is like any Del Taco locations.  Thus, no point writing a review on food.  So all the prior reviews on prices, food are probably pointless.  This is a franchise and the price on these items are set similarly across the board

However, there are a few points worth mentioning.  This location needs some cleaning.  The place smells.  I would said, the cleanliness itself lowers the rating by 1 star.  The restroom is so dirty that it is unbearable. For someone that needs a quick bite for 7 or 8 bucks, i rather take the business to Wendy's down the street.

To the franchise owner:
Please fix these problem.  Customers have choice.  I choose not to ever go back there AGAIN</Text>< user_name>

<review>Del taco @ Westwood near UCLA has nasty manager and staff in the morning like 9am and I would avoid that location at all costs when that she manager and her assistant is there. But one @ Venice near Culver city metro staff is very courteous and will recommend for Mexican and American styles fast food which are reasonably good for their price. Overall its a good foodie place for tacos, burritos etc.< /review>< user_id>

< Review>
This was my second Del Taco experience and wasn't pleased with it.  The service was okay and the store was not well-lit or kept well.  There were random people sitting there for what looked like hours.  Was glad I didn't eat-in.

Food was okay -- I thought the Del Taco experience in Arizona was much better.  It's okay for a late night, cheap craving fix.< /Review>

Great customer service but this location is filthy. The paint is falling off the walls, the restroom was extremely dirty and smelled horrible. Cleanliness must improve.<//text>

Inexpensive food. Not authentic Mexican but tasty, fast, and satisfying. Staff is helpful as long as your instructions are clear. Haven't gotten my order wrong yet and I do special orders a lot.</review>

always good food. exquisitely awesome service, especially with the kind of...  ...people...   ...with nasty, vulgar, street attitudes that sometimes come through there that those unfortunate employees have to deal with, which they do with such kindness and aplomb. gr8 job, guys n gals!!! :-)<//text>

I always get the queso burrito with guacamole. It's good, but if they would change their grease & fully clean their grease traps once a week, their fries would taste better & I'll give them a five star rating then.< /Review>

I was horrified to see a guy sitting at the corner with his eye socket missing. Everyone atound looked calm and chill about that fact. I was not ready to see that. Other than that I am glad they have beyond products at DelTaco. That puts them one step above TacoBell. The tacos were delicious.

I've been here for lunch several times now--it's the best tasting Del Taco I've been to and has fast service. Even the Buck or Less menu items were well prepared and tasted great!</review>

< Review>
This is the 4th time I've came to this location and received food with random objects inside of it. This time it was a "peel off marker pencil" whatever that is. I wish Google would let me post pictures!! On a brighter note, the lady working the drive through was very apologetic and gave me a new order.<//Review>

I am so happy KFC has been replaced by Del Taco. I have lived in Eagle Rock for a very long time and never visited KFC when it was around. Since Del Taco has opened i have been frequented this location about a half a dozen times now.<//text>

Ordered at this rest.
Order took more than 15 minutes for three items, didn't get our order right, still have to give them my receipt to make our order cauuse one of the cooks erased it from the screen..

Still left without two items I paid for..
Never coming back, not even for a cup of water.< /Text>

< Review>
Gross, I thought I was buying two original burritos for 5.00 and when I sat down to eat them it was a burrito that was open at one end and there was nothing but runny beans and a little cheese inside that ran out like lava when I bit into it, no flavor,  no lettuce tomatoes meat just beans so I finished one and threw the other one away, waste of time and money< /Review>
