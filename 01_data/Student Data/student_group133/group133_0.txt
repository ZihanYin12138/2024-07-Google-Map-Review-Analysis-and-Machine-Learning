<review>I recently rented a bike through Golden Gate rides over the weekend of May 20th 2021, the owner was super friendly and gave some really good tips regarding where to go and what to see. I cannot recommend Golden Gate Rides enough! The customer service was exceptional and I am definitely going back again to rent, I would not consider anywhere else. The bike I rented was brand new, and if I had the opportunity, would love to buy that same bike for myself. Please check them out!</review><GmapID>0x8085809026bcafeb:0x556925488b497e01</GmapID>< Rating>

<Text>I was visiting SF for a week and gave myself the weekend to play in the bathroom area. I found Golden Gate Rides and met Daniel how was very helpful and generous in renting me a bike.

I got my hands on a hard tail giant in excellent shape, hardly ridden. I tuned up the brakes a bit first but the drive train was in excellent shape, smooth shifting. Daniel hooked me up with a helmet, a lot and a tool bag with flat repair kit (tube, patches, CO2  tire irons and multi-tool). I paid $28 for a half day and got the next full day half off for $20.

For a higher price they have top notch road and mtn bikes for good shredding in the area and they'll shuttle you to your destination for a small charge - neat service I may use next time to explore farther away.

I took the bike around the city - golden gate park out to the ocean beach and lands end the first day. On the second I went over the golden gate and up and around the Marin Headlands, rodeo beach and Golden Gate recreation Area. The bike was solid the whole way. I noticed bikes from other companies were heavily branded (ex BLAZING SADDLES! COME RENT ME) makes people instantly identifiable as tourists and the bikes don't look as nice.

The location is in the tenderloin, which some consider seedy, but I had no problem or fears visiting their store front or returning after dark. It's not as bad as people say (nice speakeasy across the street).

Highly recommend! A bike can take you wonderful places.</Text>< Pictures>

Fantastic bike shop. A rare find, really. The owner and shop manager/staff in general are all so helpful/honest/kind. The rates for short and long term bicycle rental programs are super good. I loved the bike that I rented monthly from these guys. I would do it again in a heartbeat.</review>

Wonderful service can be expected here! I arrived around 10am with no reservation and they were able to get me the bike I wanted, tuned to my height, in a matter of minutes. They provided a carbon racing bike which ran beautifully. I spent the day whizzing around the otherside of the Bay ($40 well spent!). I ran a flat tire and when I brought it back they were very understanding and told me not to worry. They even showed me how to replace a tire 😂<//Review>

<Text>Very flexible, we could pick up the bikes even before the official opening hours. Bikes are quite cool and speedy but on both bikes we rented, the derailleur setup/maintenance  was not proper so the chain always jumped. At return they told us that they do service after every ride so this should not happen... :-/ but overall, a small shop with speedy bikes and friendly staff!<//Text>< rating>

Visiting SF on a work trip and hired a good carbon road bike for a Sunday ride. Super friendly staff a couple of blocks from Union Square. Very good and helpful email communication ahead of the booking and very simple and easy pick up. Nice bike too. Well done guys on 5 star customer service.< /review>

<Text>Rented a bike from here last minute on a Saturday. The bikes were really well looked after, great brakes (needed in hilly san Francisco!), and they provided you with a complimentary helmet if you wanted one as well as a bike lock. It was a joy to bike with my friends across the Golden Gate bridge, into Sausalito and catch a ferry back. Great half day trip on a sunny day. Owner was friendly too which is a bonus. Thanks guys!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>My mom, sister, and I had a wonderfully pleasant experience with Golden Gate Rides Bike Rental! The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgable. They explained which routes were best to take, which places to visit, and they even gave us extra rental time free of charge! The bikes were also very comfortable and reliable. I highly recommend this charming local shop for anyone looking to explore all San Francisco has to offer!< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOekJWYiKNnSSFfa8WqtfFI6u4SWLLk7nAuMt_E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<review>8 dollars an hour to rent bikes.  I live in this building.  See the owner Bigyan every day.  Super nice guy.  What's cool about this for locals is it's not right inside Union Square with the rest of those bike shops where nobody knows where they should be going.

TOURISTS, what's good about this place just a short walk from your Union Square hotel is that you're NOT renting bikes right next to a parking garage.  Car rental companies lease space from them, then rent cars to TOURISTS, who also have no clue where they're going and then end up hitting you.

Golden Gate Rides is just a short 5 minute walk and besides, after all you're going on a "bike ride" ;)

Use your time wisely as a warm up, then stretch outside while your bike is readying.

Cheers and enjoy SF< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNkRyAY33RUWjD8S_ba1_fJVN_f2EfY0f8aTef=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOn9vQF12uh30ckjUcztX1SCOxzTaP__zubFc6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><gmap_id>0x8085809026bcafeb:0x556925488b497e01< /gmap_id>< Date>

Great experience and excellent bikes. Bigyan is very helpful and knowledgeable of the city and culture. He’ll give you the best experience based on your schedule and desires. Very responsive... within minutes, if not immediately. Had a chain pop on one of our bikes going up one of the many steep hills and he was literally there within a few minutes with a replacement bike. My bike was awesome going fast as heck down hill and easy pedaling uphill. Biking the SF area to get to those picturesque locations, the excellent eateries, or to relax at one of the many parks is a must do and this is the best place to start. Highly recommend Bigyan and Golden Gate Rides on O’Farrell...THE Best!!!< /Text>

The bicycle would not go into first gear and the small gears also need some fine tuning. They didn't explain the gears or how to change gears so if you are a beginner it may be difficult.<//Text>

We only wanted the bikes for the evening and returned them the next morning and we were only charged for a half day. The owner was also super helpful and checked on us to make sure that we were able to get the ferry back from Sausalito as it was the last one of the night.

Woke up at 0500 and picked up my bike at 0645. The rental shop owner is really really nice and supportive.
Knowing I am going for a long ride (actually not really long, from SF to Mountain View), he gave me everything I may need in case of emergency, including the compressed-air tank, spare tube, as well as phone mount, which I worried about before picking the bike, as I didn't have a phone mount (for sure it's important for riding to somewhere new to me).
Regarding the bike, the quality is awesome, and I didn't get flat tire about 100km ride.
I have been to other bike shops before, but this one is definitely the only option I would consider if I have to pick one.<//text>

<review>Was recommended here by a friend and I must say was I ever impressed with their service and prices. No hassle, no hidden fees and very accommodating. Pirced by half or full day and the hours allow you to actually get a full day of riding in. Helmet and lock included and you also get a map and route recommendations.  This location is very central to everything which makes it a great starting point to any trip. Just remember San Francisco is very hilly so do yourself a favor and just rent for the full day, your body will thank you as you wont have to be rushing to return the bike within a couple hours or else pay excessive 'late' fees like other San Fran rentals.< /review>< Pictures>

Excellent Service and great bikes(light with plenty of gears) tailored to riding level.  Manager assisted with routing and suggestions for my 16 year old son and me.  Pricing VERY reasonable, and no bait and switch like we experienced with first rental place who lured is in with good pricing for only a heavy 'cruiser' bike, which is great if San Fransisco were flat!    Good luck in your search, but can't go wrong with this place.< /text>

<review>Great place to rent a bike. The owner was very quick to respond to my emails before I came to town. Online reservation system is easy to use. Good selection of bikes. Overall, definitely the best place to rent a bike in town and I will definitely rent from them again next time I'm in San Francisco.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Booked weeks ago to pick up a road bike at 0630. E-mailed, phoned and tried to contact loads of times to discuss details but never a response. Just turned up now and the place is locked up and dark. Not answering either of the phone numbers posted in the door.

Owner’s response to this is misleading. The website says shut Tuesday and Wednesday (not Thursday) and I’ve still not been refunded. The only response I’ve had is to this review and this was posted after I had turned up in the dark to find a locked up shop. No apology.<//Review>

We had an amazing day biking around the city and over the Golden Gate Bridge. High quality bikes made a tough ride with heavy winds  enjoyable. We were able to rent both hybrids and road bikes, so the whole family was happy. Rates were reasonable. The shop owner, Bigyan, was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!<//text>

<text>Awesome place to rent a bike! The owner is a very relaxed guy and knows a lot about bikes. As a Dutch person who cycles everyday, I think this is very important, especially after a bad experience a few days before. The owner was very helpful in picking the right size and even the sadles could be exchanged if it was too hard or soft for your liking. I ended up with a quite new, light and comfortable Cannondale bike with good brakes. The owner sent us on our way with lots and lots of helpful tips, and after 50 km of fun and nice sights I had a hard time parting with my bike again. The price was just a few dollars more than most bike shops, but the bikes are a lot better, so it's definately worth it. Would recommend this place to anyone!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObdPIB_SfcCUEgoIkSidT7LDGpa2qZbHBd4cYz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Great service. Rented a bike twice over a long weekend. First one was a decent Cannondale hybrid that rode very well for a rental bike although it needed a few adjustments in the shifting. Another day I rented a Marin mountain bike that was a great ride too. Friendly people, and they seem organized.</Text>

They made multiple adjustments, including switching pedals, saddles, etc to make us more comfortable.  They had performance road bikes, mtn bikes, standard touring bikes, and e-bikes.  You get 50% off after the first rental.  The bikes seemed to be in great mechanical shape.  I would suggest sticking with these guys instead of the other outfits near the tourist areas.

We had an amazing experience with this company. There is a price reduction if you rent the bikes more than one day, the bikes were high quality bikes (light and good gears) which were excellent maintained. Also we got a lot of personal advise for which streets we should use or avoid. Which is very handy in a city with the hills of San Francisco. Also they had a fun picture game going on which gave our bike ride a playful touch. They offer a free service to come and repair your tire when it's flat, a service we luckily did not have to use.
When I look to the quality of the other bikes which are rented in the city and combine it with the personal service, I can only conclude this is the best bike rental service in San Francisco.< /Text>

After reading the reviews on all bike rental shops in SF, this one had the best, and they sure delivered when we rented today! Polite, genuine, great service, quality bikes prepped well and when we asked about sightseeing the team drew the landmarks and the route to take on a map for us. We'd definitely recommend and would rent from them again!< /review>

I haven't tried any other bike rental shop in SF, but I'm certain that Golden Gate Rides Bike Rental is among the best: 1) super welcoming, knowledgeable & friendly staff. 2) well-maintained & high quality bikes without any branding that makes you look like a tourist ;). 3) free water, nap, helmet and phone strap.

Will rent again from here! You should too.< /Review>

<review>We randomly found this rental location online.  I called as we were leaving our hotel and they told us they had a large group coming in but they could accommodate us last minute.  Since they were low on bikes by the time we showed up we ended up with a top of the line carbon bike.  It was incredible.  Riding all the hills in San Francisco was way easier.  We rode over to Sausalito and flew by all the tourists with their rental bike (you can tell because it says their brand all over the bike).  Everyone else was walking their bikes.  Even when we got on the ferry to come back the guy who takes care of all the bikes complimented me on our bikes.  He was blown away that it was a rental.  The staff at Golden Gate Rides were so nice and accommodating.  Offered us coffee and drinks while we waited.  I left my phone in the bag on my bike and they drove it to my hotel!  If you want a great experience and a great bike (that doesn't make you feel like a dorky tourist) then this is your place.  Highlight of our trip!<//review><user_name>Eric Blonda<//user_name>< Response>

<Date>1483136812260<//Date><review>Wonderful owner and amazing deals. He offered to my 3 friends full day bike with price if half day. One of them got a flat tire, he came with his car and switched the bike for no extra. Due to an injury, I couldn't rent. Despite that, he offered us all water and snacks and helped to organize our tourism plan. Clean place and sturdy bikes. Absolutely to recommend!!</review><Gmap_id>0x8085809026bcafeb:0x556925488b497e01</Gmap_id>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><text>The service is incredible! Such nice guys! Very friendly and helpful. Gave me lots of tips about San Francisco, since it was my first time there. Biking was the best way to see the city. The bikes were in great condition. They provided us with helmets, locks and lights and even a free water bottle.
Its a great store by a laundromat and cafe. We did some laundry and got yummy pastries. They offered to switch out bikes anytime if we decided we wanted a different kind. The owner, Bigyan, rides himself and is very knowledgeable about all of his bikes. I would definitely return there when I come back to SF!< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>If you want to rent a bike in San Francisco this is the place to do that! The shop is located downtown, the bikes are excellent and the staff is amazing. We rented two bikes for a day and had the best time. Really glad we found this place. Easiest 5 starts I've given.

Excellent service, awesome staff...I was kinda timid about SF traffic and hills but Ray drew a route that took in sites including the Golden Gate Bridge, with just a few hills, and not to bad at that compared to some of the hills in this town.</review>

There's a reason this place has all these five star reviews! They have a great selection of bikes - from full carbon road bikes to mountain bikes to city hybrids. Very reasonable prices too. Set apart, however, by the friendliest owner in SF. Expect free snacks, random discounts and, if you're lucky, some business advice. Don't go anywhere else!</text>

I went here for the first time today, and it was phenomenal. I walked in around 1:00 PM, and even though most of the bikes were gone I got hooked up with an amazing bike. The prices were fantastic, and the owner really has a passion for bicycles. Highly recommend to all bike renters out there!!<//review>

<Review>I'm convinced that there isn't a better bike rental place in the city. The bikes are great and well maintained, and there are many to choose from. They also provide you with locks & Helmets if needed.

My girlfriend and I rented bikes from here and she got into a little accident and couldn't ride anymore. We called them up and they came and picked us up! Amazing service. I wouldn't rent from anywhere else in San Francisco.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>When I travel I usually try to rent a bike when I go.  The quality can vary greatly. I was able to rent for a half a day a Carbon fiber bike with disc brakes.  I rode it across the Golden Gate bridge to the Marin headlands.  The bike worked great.  I was able to keep up with the performance bicyclists.  The only giveaways were my bike shop rental helmet and my running shoes.  He will let you bring your bike shoes and pedals and will put them on for you if you want.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>I booked on Nov 2019 an electric bike..which was not available (in fact no electric bike are currently in rent but they don't update their website). So they proposed to switch to a hybrid bike and get a refund for the price gap.
Edit : I finally received the refund 3 weeks later, so raising evaluation to 3/5.< /text>< pictures>

First of all, the owner Bigyan is simply amazing. Great guy, down to earth,friendly and fun to talk to. This is probably the best decision that I've made on this visit to San Fran. Biking is a great way to go around and explore the city. Second, the bikes are great, well maintained and fun to ride. Anyway, if u are looking for a place to rent a bike. This is the place to go!< /review>

You should go and rent here. I had the time of my life riding across the Golden Gate. The bike I  rented was like new and was perfectly set up, and that made my trip very comfortable and safe. Every question was answered by him, he explained me everything on how to go to the bridge and came back. Go rent here, is the best place.</Review>

Golden Gate Rides ended up being the best way to tour San Francisco! I was able to see all ends of the city in one day - The Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, California Academy of Sciences, etc.

I showed up without a reservation and was offered a free coffee while the paper work and bike were prepped. The variety of bikes/sizes and custom seat adjustment made sure I would be comfortable for the duration of the day. I was also sent off with a helmet, lock and water bottle.

The bike itself was in great condition, very smooth ride and gears shifted turnout any issues (so important for the San Francisco hilly landscape). In total, I biked 50 miles that day and saw so much of the city! Would definitely recommend as a way to tour the city to anyone visiting.< /Text>

<review>Ok, this bike shop is just amazing. I went to san fransisco from montreal to do the escape from Alcatraz triathlon. Reserved the bike, got a brand new carbon ultegra road bike. They took time to change wheels to help me gain few minutes during the race. The evening before the race, I felt pretty hard. I called them and despite they were closing, they waited for me and check up the bike, replaced some pieces to make sure I would be alright for my race. Friendly and dedicated, they did not charged me for anything !!! After the race, I returned the bike... and forgot my power meter pedals (worth 600$ ) .. flight back to montreal ... and realized the pedals were missing. After a call, the pedals were sent the day after abroad. They literally saved my triathlon, which was the main purpose of the whole trip. Honestly, it felt refreshing to meet so nice people on this earth !!! Fun, nice, honest, passionate ... I could emphasize enough on how much this is the right place to go. They have a quite wide choice of bike and can arrange to any situation!!!! Thank you again so much !!!! Toto< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Second time they had cliff bars and water on hand which was definitely a life saver for me.

The bikes were in perfect condition and road like a breeze.

Their prices are very reasonable and if you are a repeat customer they hook you with with a discount as well.

Definitely renting from them every time I'm in SF</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This was a great experience. I’ve always wanted to hit the roads in SF. I was able to rent a solid CAAD12 and I was set up with some shoes and a helmet. Did a great 30 mile route. The bike was a lot of fun! Bigyan was in contact with me the whole way and had the bike ready for me. If you are getting a real bike, is say know bikes. You are provided with the necessary tools for a flat et . It was a fantastic ride. I’ll be back!< /Review>

Only thing I could ask for is tune the bike up before giving it to me, as the rear derailleur was skipping and the brakes needed to be tightened.

Best bike rental in SF! Great quality bikes, both hybrids and road bikes. Friendly staff, the owner helped me out and was very knowledgable. He gave me his personal number in case there were any issues, as well as a great explanation of bike routes + a map and a bottle of water.

He also said that if you rent a second time from them, it is half off. And even before that, it is still one of the most affordable rentals in town. Highly recommend it!< /text>

I can't say enough good things about my experience renting a bike for a half day!  Bigyan set me up on a great bike, at a great price.  He gave me advice on my route and just bent over backwards to make me happy.  I had a truly unforgettable experience on my ride and Bigyan was a big part of the reason!  Will definitely recommend this to my co-workers and friends!<//Review>

After riding the first time, I received a 50% discount on my next ones. I was also able to call in advance for my party of 5 and have all the different sized bikes ready to go. I definitely recommend this shop above all others.< /Text>

Some of the best service I have ever received, anywhere, ever. I showed up at this store with my freshly assembled Burning Man bike at 8am. My bus was leaving at 10am, and this was only place open to assist me with changing a defective inner tube. I owe the staff here my boundless gratitude for assisting me. Without them, I would have left for the desert with a defective bike. I made my bus and I owe part of my other worldly experience to this store.
When in San Francisco, I wouldn’t rent a bike from anywhere else!< /Text>

<text>- The owner came to late to the arranged appointment for the bike rental + 6 out of 8 bikes did not have enough air in their tires and the batteries were not fully charged.

- For this reason, we were able to leave late - but had to pay from 8 o'clock

- We agreed that we would bring the bikes back at 12:30 and pay only the hours in between instead of a full-day rental. Here the owner promised us that he will transfer the money difference (we had to pay before we rent) to our bank account. The money has not arrived yet (3 weeks back from vacation).</text><rating>1</rating>< user_name>

<Resp>{'time': 1537129331240, 'text': "Hi Christian\n\nTo make matters clear here for folks reading, I'd like to mention the following. The reservation was under Anna and not Christian but Anna's reservation was set for 8am online and that's when i showed up to work. The bikes had been ready to go the night before. I don't see how that is an issue that a few minutes were spent in explaining to you the routes and such, that's standard procedure because we have to make you aware of the nuances of riding an e-bike in San Francisco. We weren't made aware of the fact that they had other plans for which we refunded a total of $250 some dollars after they returned early.\n\nThe fact that we gave less air and battery is an outright misjudgement of us, I have to say. Why would we want the trouble? plus you were offered to call us on Whatsapp/Viber in case of any issues which we always respond to service calls immediately! We never received any service calls from you. We would rush you a new bike anytime.\n\nThe total cost you had paid for is $496.93 because we kept going back and forth from city hybrid to e-bikes and the discounts you wanted.\n\nThe regular cost for all e-bikes is $325.50 (for 6 half days e-bikes) and  + $148.50 (for two full days e-bikes) = $474.00 which you forgot to mention in your review two of your friends came after a full days ride. Only six of you returned at 12:30 PM which is considered a half day (under 6 hours) from 8am-12:30pm.\n\nYou are entitled a refund for $474.00- ($227 + $ 22.93) = $249.93 which by the way the credit card you should have received. We charged half day even though the original was supposed to be a full day, which mind you hurts our ability to gain revenue on such. I understand you might think the situation calls for a full refund, but i gave back what I felt was right for half a day worth of usage on our bikes.\n\nPlease be aware that an average waiting time to receive bikes is 10-20 minutes your first time getting bikes with us, and is no way our intention to stall anyone longer than necessary. If you have plans such as museums where you are going to be away from bikes too long such as Alcatraz, it'd be nice to know beforehand so we can better prepare you.\n\nLet me know if that answers your queries and please please when and if you decide to ride with us, communicate with us so we can help make your experience better."}< /Resp><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

We rented bikes to bike the bridge. We were running late for our Alcatraz tour so they suggested we take the ferry back. They met us at the pier and picked up our bikes.

They were SUPER helpful and friendly and went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience. I cannot recommend them enough! Absolutely fanatstic!</Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>My wife and I went on a tour lead by Bigyan with Golden Gate Rides. As a disclaimer I am an avid cyclist, but the shop is able to accommodate all types/ skill levels from bike type and route difficulty. The bikes were quality, from road bikes to mountain bikes.
Overall the tour was, 1) lots of fun 2) a way to see lots of San Francisco in a short, 'high-yield' period of time 3) did I say fun already? 4) an excellent value.

Bigyan was very easy to hang out with all afternoon, he wants to do what you want to do. I can't imagine another outfit making the process more easy and relaxed, or renting bikes of a similar quality.
I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to go for a ride to see the city, and would not hesitate to take family and friends if I am back in San Francisco.< /Review><username>Samuel Carrell<//username>< Rate>

< Review>
My wife and I decided we wanted to go for a bike ride around the bridge and golden gate park and we decided to call this place (which was newly established) because it was the closest to where we were staying. Upon calling to reserve, the guy there asked us our height and bike preferences and had two like new bikes ready to go with helmets and locks in the morning. He took the time to explain what routes to take and what event was happening on that day, so we biked through the park and ended up riding the bridge and hanging out at the picnic in the Presidio! It was an awesome day and very smooth riding their bikes around town. Will definitely try other routes when we are back in town.<//Review>

They just made my day in SF!!! I was in the city half day and I wanted to see as much as I could, so I wanted to rent a bike. I saw all the reviews were a 5 so I left my luggage at the Chancellor and went there. They have really nice bikes (they work with cannondale) at very reasonable prices! Half day rates are less than $30  and you get a lock and a helmet. I rented a fixed gear and had an amazing experience.
I wouldn't try anywhere else.</Review>

We were greeted by a very friendly employee who opened a few minutes early for us! He took the time to tell us where to go on a map, all the hot spots to hit as well as places to avoid, when to expect hills and the several places we could drop the bikes off if we decided to leave them in Fishermans wharf. The bikes worked great and this activity made our trip!< /Text>

I highly recommend these guys. The rental experience was smooth and I was setup with a high end Cannondale that made my trip. I covered over 40 miles in a day and am really glad I went with a high end rental. Biggest difference was the smaller backpack they suggested I borrow so I could leave my bulky travelling gear at their shop. They also make a mean breakfast sandwich to fuel up while you're setting up the rental.< /Text>

This rental was great. Friendly and helpful. The bikes were in good condition and they didn't have a logo on the front like some places do which always screams tourist. We even got a tshirt. I will be using this company for any of my future trips to San Fran!<//review>

Great place!  I biked around San Francisco after reading reviews on this bike rental shop.  They take walk ins, though ideally you would reserve online ahead of time.  I showed up unannounced in the morning and gave the owner a small scare!  Still, he was very friendly, set me up with a very roadworthy bike + helmet, and locks.  The shop also has maps of tour spots and bike routes.  Would recommend if you're in the area and want to bike.</review>

Really great bike rental - excellent value for money, way cheaper than everywhere else in SF! Bigyan gave us a heavy discount on the road bike rental as it was the only bike left in my girlfriend's size, and it was a really nice bike.

The rest of the bikes are far better than what you get from many other places in SF. As well as that, it's a great place to stop for a snack or a beer during your ride.

As well as that Bigyan is extremely friendly and helpful, and gave us free bottles of water!

Great place, can't recommend enough.< /Text>

I rent bikes A LOT when I go out of town.  Golden Gate Rides has set the bar for all the rest.  They delivered the bike to my hotel, outfitted it with SPD pedals and made sure I had everything I needed.  Great communication, great service and a great bike.  I highly recommend Golden Gate Rides!< /Text>

Great bikes and service. I rented twice while I was in town and they were exactly what I was looking for near my hotel downtown. Cannondale hybrid to cruise for a couple hours and a carbon synapse to head up to the mountains north of the bridge!</text>

Rented four electric bikes for a sunny day in SF and were told the range on the bikes would be 20-30 miles, depending on how efficient you ride it. Went through the planned route with one of the employees and some quick instructions and we were on our way.

Just after a few miles we noticed the battery level on two of the bikes were already starting to decrease fast, so we tried to ride them as efficient as possible, but after reaching 12-13 miles two of the bikes were already the lowest battery level so we were expecting them to die pretty soon.

At this point we were in Sausalito so we had to ditch our planned route of coming back over the brigde and decided to take the ferry instead, due to the low battery level. This ended up costing us an extra 12.5$ pr. person. After getting off the ferry we drove through the city and ended up getting back to the shop with the battery still holding up on all bikes, which was an positive suprise.

Upon arrival one on the employees asked us if everything was as expected and told them about the battery indicator being at the lowest point very early and about two of the backbrakes not being 100% on the bikes. Did not get the chance to mention this at the site, but the suspension on all bike were really poor also, which made the ride uncomfortable.

This eventually led up to me having a longer discussion with the manager that totally ruined this experience us. Whatever we told him, there would follow a longer explanation as to why we were wrong and he was right, not willing to listen to what we had to say. Instead, he kept on talking about unrelated matters and trying to steer away from the real issue, that the bikes performed poorly. Eventually we got him to take one of the bikes out and got him to admit that the brakes were not working 100%. From the discussion we learned that we had also not been given all of the instructions needed as to how the bike and battery indicator works, and the manager at this point told us that we should read the manual before riding a bike like this (what?).

The experience in itself was maybe three stars, but followed by an discussion with an arrogant manager, not willing to listen to what his customer has to say, I see no option to give this just the one star. Expensive as well, several cheaper companies in the area.</text>

Excellent quality bikes, be sure to reserve online or call in advance to ensure someone's there when you arrive (operates out of the back of a coffee shop / laundromat).

Would highly recommend for anyone looking to rent bikes in SF. Service and price can't be beat.<//Text>

A small outfit with excellent, friendly service, Binyan was very helpful suggesting routes and the city I could take and the hybrid Cannondale bike was speedy, in good condition and a pleasure to ride. Unfortunately my ride was cut short by an accident (entirely down to my own carelessness) but Binyan was great about it and dropped everything to come and collect the bike and take me to urgent care, and he called later to check I was OK. I felt like he went the extra mile to take care of me and would have no hesitation recommending this place to any visitor wanting to tour San Francisco by bike.</text>

WOWZER!! Best bike experience!! The guy was amazingly accommodating, fit the bikes to us and gave us great pointers on where to go and what to see. They even hooked us up with some water for the road. Best of all we were rocking 2 Giant Escape models . They were fantastic for the hills I mean SLAYED  at the climb! -and we did a lot of climbing! We passed many MANY bikers who were walking the hills with their rental bikes in hand b/c they couldn't cut it. Saw a lot of Blazing Saddles bikes out there getting walked.

Safe to say you CAN NOT go wrong with the price quality and service you will get from this cool little establishment, BT-dubz It's inside of a laundry-mat/ bar/ coffee joint. little hard to find- but you'll see beyond the bar, bikes all over. lots of nice bikes, Giants and Cannonadales and maybe some specialized.</text>

<review>The guys from Golden Gate Rides were awesome. They gave us free coffee before and after our ride, told us about some great spots to ride, and hooked up up with some UNBELIEVABLE bikes. The bikes were high end Cannondale road bikes. My fiance and I have been cycling for 5 years, but have never ridden as nice of bikes as GGR provided. I don't think think we would have been able to handle all the hills in the city without them. I would highly recommend GGR to anyone. Great Dudes, GGR rocks!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<text>I was searching for a bike rental online to get around in San Francisco. I found Golden Gates Ride with its perfect rating and did not get dissapointed.

The Rental was super easy. As it was raining that day Bigyan also gave me a helmet and soon I hit the road. Though the weather was changeable I had a nice ride through Golden Gate Park and over the Golden Gate Bridge. However, close to the Point Bonita Light House I got unlucky, and a small glass splinter flattened my front tire. Calling back to the renal, Bigyan was super helpful. As he couldn't come himself right away he called me an Uber cab at his expense that brought me and the broken bike to the shop. Quite a memorable day for my. But whenever I come back to SF I'm sure where I'll rent my bike :)< /text>< Rating>

{'time': 1496286652009, 'text': "Hi Thomas\n\nWe are sorry you feel that way. Upon checking the cameras during the time when you returned, your bike looked like the locks were obstructing the front brakes with the amount of weight that was put on it. You rode the largest bike with the largest lock we have, so if you put weights on parts of a bike like that, its only natural the weight will push against the cables and the brake pads. We had instructed you to call us if you had any problems during the ride, which we don't see any calls from you so there's no way we would have known how your ride is going. We could have helped you if you did. We knowingly would never give you a bike that doesn't function well.\n\nSorry but we can't provide refunds for situations beyond our control and specially when you let us know the problem after the ride is over. I hope you and our future customers find this response useful."}< /Response>

<text>(Translated by Google) AIRLINE CREW CAN GET A 50% DISCOUNT!

The owner is very friendly
If you're going to go to Sausalito or a battery spanner, I recommend an electric bike!
If you want your thighs to burst, just rent a bicycle.
50% discount by showing the airline ID (photo available)

If you go three blocks to the left from the shop, you will find POLK STREET
There is no hill on the road, so it is easy to go to the Golden Gate Bridge.

허벅지 터지고 싶으면 그냥 자전거 빌리세요ㅋㅋ
항공사 아이디(사진 가능) 보여주면 50% 할인해줌

샵에서 왼쪽으로 세 블럭 가면 POLK STREET 나오는데

Thanks to you, it was a good trip.

Thanks for the greatest service ever :)

굉장히 친절합니다.
자전거를 빌려서 여행 중에 고장이 났었는데, 1시간 이내로 트럭으로 새로운 자전거를 가져다 줬습니다.
덕분에 좋은 여행이 됐습니다.

Thanks for the greatest service ever :)</text>

자전거를 잘 못타서 빌리지는 못했는데 정말 친절하게 설명해주시고 격려해주셨어요. 시간을 뺏은 것 같아서 죄송합니다. 감사합니다 :)</review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I think it's a good place to leave a review. I was impressed by the staff for the first time I traveled to the United States. It was good to give free water and snacks. If you are thinking of renting a bicycle, be sure to rent it here.

Sooooo nice staff. They touch my mind. They let us know many tips about city and other things. Bike is also great. If you plan to rent a bike in San Francisco this is the greatest place to rent.

왠만하면 글로 리뷰 안남기는데 좋은곳이라고 생각해서 이렇게 글 남깁니다. 미국 여행하면서 처음으로 직원한테 감동했네요 정말 친절하고 자전거 상태도 다른 대여점보다 매우 좋습니다. 물이나 간단한 스낵같은것을 무상으로 주는것도 좋았습니다. 혹시 자전거 대여하실 생각이신 분들은 꼭 여기서 빌리세요 강추!!!

(Translated by Google) Super fast bikes with or without an electric motor. We had both. E-bikes are definitely recommended for inexperienced cyclists or those who are not very sporty. Depending on the route you choose, there are sometimes very steep climbs.

Super schnelle Bikes ob mit oder ohne E-Motor. Wir hatten beides. Für nicht geübte Radfahrer oder eher Unsportliche, E-Bike unbedingt zu empfehlen. Je nach Route die man wählt, teils sehr steile Anstiege.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Totally great, in terms of service and quality of the bikes! Maybe not very cheap, but doable. 38 dollars for a whole day or 28 dollars for a half day. Seems a lot, but that's pretty common in SF.

The boss is very kind and will do his best to help the guests. The accessories will be provided free of charge. Although the store is not big, the car will not repeat with other people. It is really a great store.

(Translated by Google) Very good experience to visit San Francisco by bike. Out of season, the store is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (lunch break between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.), but you can book by phone outside these hours. For $ 40 a day, I got a good Geant bike with anti-theft, helmet, city map giving bike routes, a bottle of water and all the explanations to make my day a success. Very friendly staff. The city's many bicycle routes make it an ideal mode of transportation if you want to get out of downtown

(Original)
Très bonne expérience pour visiter San Francisco à vélo. Hors saison, le magasin est ouvert de 9h à 18h (pause de midi entre 11h et 16h), mais on peut réserver par téléphone en dehors de ces horaires. Pour 40$ la journée, j'ai eu un bon vélo Geant avec anti-vol, casque, carte de la ville donnant les itinéraires vélo, une bouteille d'eau et toutes les explications pour faire de ma journée une réussite. Personnel très sympa. Les nombreux itinéraires vélo de la ville en font un mode de transport idéal si l'on veut sortir de downtown</Review>

I went in and ordered a part and he will let me know when it comes in. I knew they wouldn't have it in stock but I had heard from other people that this is a great place to go to buy things for like your refrigerator or washer and dryer when they break if you're going to DIY it.< /Review>

<text>Needed a part for my Kenmore dryer. I called Appliance Parts Depot to find out if they carried the 2 possible parts I would need.  After explaining to Paul at Appliance Parts Depot what was going on with my dryer he said, "it's most likely the thermal fuse, it usually is". Paul said he had it in stock.   When I arrived at the store with my thermal fuse,  Paul tested it and it was bad.  Paul did not try to sell me any parts I did not need and even said he was trying to save me money. Brought the part home,  installed it, and my dryer started right up.  Thanks Paul for your knowledge,  assistance,  and saving me money.</text>< pics>

I have a 15 year old dryer and the door plate broke. The repair guy said its 25 bucks for the part and 60 dollars for labor... ummm nope. So YouTube it and went to appliance part depot and the part was 4 dollars. It took 20 mins.. saved money.< /Review>

This is the best parts supply house in town. Buy from here whenever you can so we still have a parts house in town!!!!  Because when all the small guys are out of business the big guys have us by the balls. #supportsmallbuisness< /text>

Drove by at 8:10am on the off chance they may be open. Well not quite (8:30am) but I saw someone sitting behind counter. Door was locked, that's fine. But there was no human interaction from the guy. I guess I'm not worth acknowledging, so he is not worth coming back to- I went to Target and bought my water filters there.< /review>

I gave this business a 3 star only because it's not everyday you see the person opening up the shop kick a homeless mans feet to run the poor guy off the property.... the guy might have been homeless but he isn't an animal and didn't deserve it.I also understand that we have to deal with these human beings everyday the problem isn't going to go away.<//text>

Treated the family to gourmet hot dogs, and an impressive range of dogs indeed! Those, and a delightful bottle of bubbly for us adults made the night a success.  A beautiful spot right off of Gravenstein Hwy.  We'll definitely be back for more!< /review>

<Name>Casey McKelvey< /Name><time>1613380712396</time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>As my boyfriend and I were driving to the coast taking the scenic route (since I just moved to CA from the east coast and have never been through wine country before), we passed Claypool Cellars and my boyfriend secretly looked it up for me and turned around (knowing I’m a huge fan of Les and Primus). I had no clue Les and his wife had ventured in the wine industry! We sat outside and drank a bottle of the Rosé. It was delicious. Our server was great. He is a very friendly guy and actually sat down and talked with us for a bit and even got my dog a water bowl. He was talking about the Sauerkraut Party and how they will be doing clam chowder this year (I would love to go if I am able to). I had a great time during my short stop here and could have stayed all day. Great atmosphere! This is definitely going to be one of my go to spots whenever I’m in Sonoma County again. Thank you for the wonderful time! I will see you over the electric grapevine!<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGNU7HOUeih7kPWunb2s8aFH-Gai4d6HDciJiR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONdS9P-wgggPB7XWkTSbIrlZW0hBKJJQAFJSBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

Great spot, unpretentious, solid wines.
Note: we went on a Wednesday so it was pretty quiet. Marina was very attentive and wonderful to chat with, as was the other couple in the tasting room. We had an amazing time.<//Text>

We didn't make an appointment and it didn't seem to be a problem. Been to a fair few wine tastings and had a really unique experience here ! Definitely worth a detour if you're anywhere nearby.</text>< user_name>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I am REALLY impressed by this place. I went after a friend mentioned that Les Claypool (of Primus) had a winery in Sonoma County.

The wines are not inexpensive, but they are worth the price. I was not charged for tasting, as I bought a couple bottles, and the pours are generous. Surprisingly, they even had their champagne (from France, so it is OK to call it champagne) open for tasting. Their prices for tasting are pretty normal, starting around $20.

The tasting room is intimate; there is seating for 10 or so. There is a good selection of shirts, glasses, etc. for sale as well. The lady pouring casually mentioned that Les will not be in as he's on tour, but implied that he is often in the tasting room.

Thank you Claypool Cellars for a great experience, I will definitely visit again soon!

Update June 2019:

@jamsjoybungalow food truck present serving awesome south Asian cuisine. I had the pleasure of meeting Les Claypool, and was treated to a wonderful glass of 2018 Rosé and a generous pour of the 2014 Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.

Once again the service was AMAZING, and Les was totally awesome even though I was a bit akward. Thanks for a great time! See you soon!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><userid>108472585116402272784< /userid></record>

Expensive but excellent Pinot Noir, and lots of geeky Primus silliness. Also, a very tasty Champagne (not a California Sparkling Wine, actual Champagne).<//Review>

< Review>
Very friendly staff there shop has a nice decorated design. They're clean and well organized. I have not experienced a pedicure yet but just by observing the nail techs they make you feel comfortable. My nail tech always does a remarkable job with my acrylic nails. My drive from Fontana to Norco is worth the drive.</Review>

I usually don’t like getting my cuticles removed cause I’ve had bad experiences in the past BUT today I decided to just get the full experience and I’m glad I did cause Mindy did an awesome job! She’s light on her fingers so I didn’t feel a thing and it didn’t messed up my hands. I love how it turned out 🙂 will come back here again</review>

<text>I took my elderly father in for a manicure and pedicure. Unfortunately, they couldn't perform the pedicure because he couldn't get into their high seats. My father has problems  doing certain things due to health issues. I wish they would of just brought a plastic bin of water to place his feet in so they could just do a basic pedicure.  So glad they were able to perform a manicure. I hope I find an establishment that caters to the elderly with certain limitations.< /text>< Pictures>

So far I've had the pleasure of meeting with Tina, Evan, Rose, and Kim. They are true professionals and their pedis are on point. I appreciated the callous treatment and the fact they are not afraid to really dig into the dead skin. Just like any other establishment, if you treat the hard workers with respect you get it back. Thank you!<//text>

First Off, been there twice, a few years ago & no complaints.... this time the lady did such a sloppy job, I even asked her if she could please remake the flower and she was bothered because she drew it all crooked and expected me to be content. Then she demands a tip by asking me if "I'm going to put it tip on my credit card or if I'm going to give her cash" a little bit of pressure here, don't you think?...I'll never go there again!!!😡<//Review>

I just had the worse experience at this place. It was my first time going there and a young man that works there did my nails. His work sucked so much! Imwhen he was shaping my nails I told him that i wasn’t liking how they were coming out because they were really un even. But he said “he wasn’t finished”. When he was pretty much almost finished I complained again, because I really wasn’t about to pay $37 for my nails to come out messed up! You can tell he was upset. But I really did not want to be rude.. but when I noticed that he was upset and did not see the mistake he made, that’s when I became frustrated. I had them remove them.. never again am i going back to this place. And if any one decided to go here. DO NOT go with him. He will waste your time!< /Review>

<review>This place sucks!!!! Kaylee was my manicurist and she was very rude to me, this was my first and last time to go there😠.  In the middle of the process she gets up and leaves me there for 15 min.  Turns out the she went to wax someone's eyebrows. Time is $ so I won't be spending any disrespectful and unprofessional people. Do you're self a favor go somewhere else where they value your time!<//review>< pictures>

Bad customer service. Ill keep it short. We ordered a caramel Sunday. We ask for extra caramel on the side. Lady said no we don't do that. I said no problem we will pay for it. She said no we still can't do that either. What kind of restaurant does this? Its a business, you sell things to make a profit. It just boggled my mind when she said she couldn't sell it. That women needs to be fired. I wish I had her name.<//Text>

Actually visited the KFC with the A&W rootbeer.  Chicken greasy and cold as I ordered extra and didn't get what I wanted at the drive through not sure when or if I will return. Mashed potatoes and gravy cold. Biscuit was okay. Pieces of chicken plentiful as ordered but not what I come to expect in taste. Overpriced for what is ordered.
A&W rootbeer is the reason why 2 stars. Service was fast in drive through but really needs to work on attitude.</Review>

We were not satisfied with Red Robin this time.  Everybody food was cold this time around, couldn't figure it out. We normally stay  and enjoy ourselves, but we couldn't wait to get out of there.   Hopefully it was just this one time other then that we will will never go back again if that continues.</review>

<text>I arrived 19 minutes after they opened (10:19am) and everything was filthy.  The soda machine was trashed, there were flys flying around it, the floor was not clean (anywhere), several of the tables and chairs were covered in crumbs, the trash receptacle was almost as bad as the soda machine, and I haven't even got my food yet.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Wanted something quick for a long drive.  40 minutes in drive thru.  Average car took about 8 minutes each.  Food was good so it saved the experience.<//Text>

<Text>If I could, I would give this fine establishment zero stars. Everytime we come here the diningroom is filthy. I don't want to imagine what the kitchen looks like. Picture does not show the diningroom stickiness. Picture is to show everyone waiting on this super busy Tuesday 8pm evening.    Service is nothing but fast or courteous. Ordered Papa combos and it took a quick 27 minutes to get order, To be short a burger to boot.

PLEASE FIX YOUR RESTAURANT.< /Text>< Pictures>

I tried the kung pao prawns here and they were good. I don't normally choose them at fast food Chinese places but I took a change. Nice job, tasted fresh.</text>

My favorite Chinese restaurant in southern Marin. The food is high quality and service is fast, and it's the best Chinese food in the area without crossing the bridge. May is very friendly, as other reviewers have noted. As a note, they recently switched to take-out only.< /Review>

<Text>I have been going to Lam's for years. Their food is fresh, well seasoned, and very tasty. May is an absolute sweetheart and recognizes my voice when I call an order to go. Every dish I've had is hot and absolutely delicious. Don't be fooled by the casual atmosphere. It is my to-go Chinese restaurant in Marin hands down!</Text>< pictures>

We stopped in as we were passing by, and it was a TREAT. Such friendly service, and the food was the best we have had in a while. IF we are ever by here again, we will stop by ... gladly ... and with NO hesitation.< /review>

Ordered two lunch specials and fried prawns. Stir-fry tasted really good and seemed fresher compared to other Chinese restaurants. Prawns were perfectly cooked and not greasy at all. Will definitely come back when we are at Mill Valley area.<//Review>

Kind of a dump. The food is not good. The meat was soft and squishy. I wonder if it was even real meat. With other good dining options in Mill Valley this is one to avoid.< /review>

<text>Absolutely delicious chinese food. I've ordered lunch from here several times and its always been the best and very reasonable in price!

Their hot and sour soup is delicious, chow mein is so tasty (not overly prepared with oil), and their spicy green beans and salt and pepper tofu are delicious! I've also had their sizzling rice soup when I've been sick and its  full of yummy veggies and the broth was delicious.

I wish I lived here in MV but I fear I'd be eating here everyday !!</text><GmapID>0x8085907317d5ca1d:0x9e60ba8aeb800e0< /GmapID><time>1508963983910</time>< rate>

I love Lam's. I have lunch here at least twice a week. The food is delicious, fresh, and inexpensive. It's a family-run business and they make a point of knowing their good customers' names and their preferences. The kitchen is squeaky clean. The decor makes it a place that you're not going to seek out for date night, but if you want tasty, no-frills Chinese food you won't be disappointed. Weekday lunch is their busy time when it seems like every construction trade worker in Marin descends at the same time. Favorites include the wah wonton soup,  green bean prawns, mu shu  anything, and spicy eggplant chicken.</Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) The taste is normal Chinese food, but the clerk who is happy with vegetables is also a friendly and good restaurant.

<username>Lucianna Francesca Ford</username><review>I Love This Place And Tom Is Amazing. Does Everyone Know That They Do More Than Just Sell Tires??? I Had Bought A Suburu Forester in February 2020 And It Began To Over Heat And I Didn't Know What To Do Because Everyone Was Giving Me Wrong Information And High Pricing, So I Let The Car Sit. I Went To Big O Tires In Canoga, I Had A Previous Vehicle Of My Mine Repaired There, And Explained What Was Wrong. Tom & Jeremy Had The Mechanic's Check The Whole Cooling System And Inspected The Whole Vehicle Actually! What Is Important Is That I Trust Them And They Give Honest Information Without Trying To Oversell You To Make Money! I Well,They Repaired It And It Runs Better Than Ever. I Was Afraid To Drive My Car, But Not Any More! They Do My Oil Changes And I Even Brought Rims, Red,  There. I Know When I Drive Away My Suburu Is Really Fixed And I Do Not Feel Nervous!  I Will Never Ever Let Anyway Else Touch My Car. Thanks Tom And Jeremy For Keeping Me Safe😉 P.S. They always Check All The Fluid Levels As A Courtesy.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Poor customer service. Walked in the store and was ignored by the manager and crew, which was busy talking among themselves in the working area. Perhaps they thought I wasn't that important. Everyone walking in your store is a customer and deserves to be addressed quickly regardless of what your doing</Review>< Name>

The employees at this location are some of the friendliest staff you can find. I've been going here for a while. Free tire pressure testing. The kid who helped me check my tire pressure yesterday was super kind and helpful! Also recommend getting the tire insurance. It's a great deal!< /Text>

Went in for a tire repair. Went to the counter, guy who helped me was nice.  Told me what it would cost if it was repairable.  Now, considering I don’t have another tire, and it isn’t smart to drive on a donut, wouldn’t you as a salesperson offer to sell a new tire for someone who CLEARLY needs one?  I took my services elsewhere (J&J tires on Eton Ave) and they replaced my tire with a used one and installed it.

Moral of the story, If you might need more than what you ask for, go elsewhere.< /Text>

Under the management of Armondo and Tommy, this Big O Tires is great. Efficient work in a very convenient location. Some work may be cheaper elsewhere, but I don't feel like these guys try to scare you into doing more work than you need, as I believe was the case under previous managers.<//Text>

Back to Big O to have some work done on my SUV. Nasty rattle from the suspension so I figured I would order multiple (pricey) parts online and have Tom's team install them. He was happy to help out and during the teardown and inspection they found that I only needed one of the parts I had supplied. Tom called to let me know that it was a quicker fix and that I could return the remaining parts to get a refund. How many other shops would have just installed everything I gave them and charged me the full price? Great customer service, saved money and no more rattling noise!< /review>

I went in for a wheel balance and an alignment on my 2009 Nissan 370z. The mechanic Keith knew his stuff and explained what he fixed and the store manager was really cool, he listen to my questions and gave me a discount through some coupon. My car feels smooth again. I'm definitely taking my wife's car here next.<//Review>

Had my oil changed, which was a good price. They determined that I needed my brakes and rear rotors changed. I explained that I had just ordered those parts from Amazon earlier that day. Tom (the owner, I have been told) then told me that they could put those parts on for me for $100. I said the parts wouldn't be arriving until Sunday, and he replied that they would be open then.  I went to have the service done today (Sunday) and the guy at the counter double checked the price with Tom over the phone. Now I was told that it was $200 ($100 per axle) and that I had misheard  - which I certainly hadn't .  I let them know I felt they were doing a classic "bait and switch". They wouldn't honor the first quote, so I left. Very disappointed .</text>

< review>
If I could give a minus one star to this people would. They place one of my tires wrong.  I had to pay extra to have it fixed.  They place a wrong size air filter. They could not add transmission fluid to my second car because It was sliding, of course It was. IT WAS MISSING FLUID!!. In few words . This place is a disaster.<//review>

< review>
This shop put the WRONG under rated tires on my truck.  It was discovered by another tire shop.  They put 4 ply tires on a truck when I should have had 10 ply tires.  The shop that found the problem told me that the vehicle was dangerous to drive and the tires could blow out any time.  I was shocked because we pull a trailer thought the mountains a lot when we go camping.
When I called this shop, the owner wanted to charge me 80 dollars to install the correct tires on my truck.  I told him it was not right for me to pay to have the tires installed because I paid when they installed the wrong tires.  He did not care.

At that point we had the tires put on at another Big O shop in Glendale and they did not charge us for the tire installation.

This place SUCKS I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!!!</review>

Pro service, very fast and always helpful. Been to them a few times to check out tire pressure sensors, as well as check for nails. Often times there was no charge for small work that they did. That service will keep me coming back whenever I require tire work. Thanks gents,</Text>

Used to visit here regularly, but the staff just didn't seem genuine anymore. They said they'd give me a deal on an alignment, but it was the same price as the last two times I went, and the car still pulls hard to the side. I've given up on them< /text>

I purchased a Groupon for three oil changes and was informed today when I went in for my 3rd one that "no, we don't take that that was the old owner's coupon." And I was shown a little sign they have up saying they "the new ownership" does not honor the coupon. I told him that is not the way to keep existing customers and they just lost this one. My advice Mr. New Manager you need some new communication skills, I had no idea there was a new owner and the manner in which it was presented was poor and made me not want to do business with you. Mr. New Owner you need a lesson on keeping customers. That was a bad move on your part for not honoring that coupon because you will miss out on all the extra work that comes along with it, in addition to a loyal customer for years to come. Customers are hard enough to come by so thanks for letting me know you don't need my money, I'll go give it to some other business that does.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Good food. Good prices. The roll I ordered has well filled...a good balance between rice and fillings/toppings. I will be back!< /Review>

Amazing prices! Great quality! I plan on returning soon.

Wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Atmosphere was pretty standard for a small sushi joint. Very clean and pleasant to the eye. The reasons that have me returning very soon would be the excellent quality of food, the amazing prices, and the 50% off beer 6 days a week.< /review>

The taste and prices is great but right now because they are short staffed the wait time for the food is up to 1 hour. But they will tell you it's 25-30 minutes.< /Text>

The service is a little slow but still nice. A simple salmon roll is like $3.50 and a bento plate is $6.99... So good.< /Text>< user_id>

I have been coming to this sushi spot for awhile now. I recommend the baked salmon roll! The food here is great. The prices are awesome and they do their best to be fast with the service. Best sushi spot that I have tried.</text>

Food was good, service was not. Took about 30 minutes to be helped, while sitting at a table in a fairly empty room. Took another 40 min to be served. I believe the Server (women) needs some help with her customer service skills. Very disappointed.</Text>

<review>Fast and easy! Great customer service. I recently started services. I received an inspection to make sure it was all safe at my place. Next, I got propane delivered in a timely manner and the price was fair. Thank you Van Unen Miersma Propane for the pleasant experience.< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

< Review>
After being without propane for over a week and getting nothing but lies and the runaround from a different propane company,  my daughter called Van Unen Miersma Propane after receiving great recommendations about them from other families in the community.  Ryan and the staff from Van Unen Miersma Propane were wonderful from the first moment we contacted them.  We were able to quickly set up an account with them and they delivered propane the very next day!  We finally had heat again!  The customer service from Van Unen Miersma Propane was nothing less than OUTSTANDING.  We highly recommend Van Unen Miersma Propane for your propane needs!!!</Review>

<Review>If I could give this company zero stars I would.

I reached out to them 5 months ago to ask for a small extension for paying the remainder of my bill (additional 30 days).  Due to COVID-19 and not being able to secure employment I was struggling financially.  They were not only unwilling to help me but extremely rude and insensitive.

So many companies have been so supportive during these challenging times it was horrible to be treated in this way.

I sent my concerns in writing to which NO ONE reached out to see how they could help.

This company is only successful due to consumers paying them and in return they are unwilling to help their customers during these unprecedented times.<//Review><rating>1</rating><Name>Sabrina Schwartz<//Name></record>

Everyone at Van Unen Miersma Propane have been extremely nice and helpful!!! I just moved to Copperopolis and this is my first time using propane. They explained everything to me in a way that I would understand. I very highly recommend Van Unen for your propane needs.< /Text>

Everyone has been very helpful and great to work with. Ryan was a valuable source of information about tank selection and stayed in touch throughout the purchase and delivery process, providing excellent customer service. The office staff and service tech were also very helpful. I did a lot of research and shopping around before settling on Van Unen Miersma. Their prices were very competitive and their service and communication are excellent; something that is a rarity these days.<//Review>

A gentleman named Ryan Who works for Van Unen helped me out by getting this project done and running very promptly. Also anytime we need extra propane service for main tank Van Unen is very quick to respond. Thank you so much for your wonderful customer service.</text>< pics>

Fast and professional communication & service.   A pleasure to do business with. After installing a brand new tank, Don made a thourough check for any leaks and lit up the water heater and made sure everything worked fine. From first call to everything done was only one day. Online billing system was also easy to use.<//text>

<Text>2 times they have come to my ‘rescue’,. 1st. Time to move the propane tank about 5 ft. So I could build an enclosure, now they’ve come to my house again and removed and changed a very tight fitting on a gas stove  that I could not budge. Thanks to them and their prompt and courteous help.</Text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>When we first signed up for this propane company, we were promised that they could beat anyone else's prices.  This is far from the truth.  I price check every year and they are far from the best so I switched back to my old company.  After I cancelled service, I was informed that there is a $135 tank pick up fee.  We were never advised of this in the beginning.  If you have a decent propane company, don't do yourself a disservice by switching.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Text>Switched over from another company I was with for 5 years and from the first experience with them I knew I made the right decision. Everyone from the sales guy to the installers to the person that fills the tanks was amazing and very professional. Seems like they only hire great people and take care of them. Have already recommended them to 3 friends who also have had a great experience. Thanks guys!!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I love their economy program. They estimate your use over a period of years, the break the cost down so you on have one regular payment deducted from your account. It makes it so simple.< /Text>

<text>We were using another service that had allowed my elderly father to run out of propane on two occasions. This happened even though we were on their scheduled route. We were dangerously close to running out a third time two days before Christmas.  I made multiple calls without receiving any response.  Out of desperation I called Van Unen Miersma. After explaining our situation they said it would be at least four days before they could get there. I scheduled the truck and made arrangements to be on their route. They came the next day!  We were so grateful!  It’s been four years and we have never experienced a single issue. We are customers for life!</text><Name>Suzanne Dean<//Name></record>

I never have had to even think about my propane bill as a small amount is deducted from my bank every month and it more than covers the cost of the propane.  Plus we get a discount for this plan. I used to get a bill for over $400.00 at a time from our old supplier and it always set me back.  Now I sit back and don't worry about it.  No fuss, no muss and the cost is the best around, which is an added bonus.  Love you Van Unen Miersma Propane.< /review><Name>Judy Odell</Name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This business supported Jeff Denham for Congress in 2016 by promoting him on their freeway sign off the 99. Imo Jeff is a sold out congressperson who doesn't deserve our support. Over 40% of the people in our district have insurance through the government due to the fact that we live in a poor Republican controlled district. I hope they choose to support more Progressive candidates in the future.< /Text>< date>

I have been a customer of Van Unen Miersma for about 10 years.  The deliveries have been timely and the pricing consistent.  Plus, the personnel are always friendly and helpful.<//Text>

I have been so happy with Van Unen Miersma Propane.  They always know when I need propane, and I've never had any problems with this company.  I would highly recommend them to those who use propane.</Review>

<Review>Complete Joke. Watch out for all of their hidden fees and surprises. If you’re looking for a propane company, steer clear!  Failed to put us on routing after installing the tank so we ran out of propane. Didn’t fill for 5 days, which means no heater, no cooking and no showers. Absolutely and entirely dissatisfied. Would put zero stars if I could.  😡😡😡😡 Thank you Campora, Inc. for coming through for us!!!!!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>We had a acct with them for 9 years 3 months. Last year (2017) we bought a house in Manteca our move was the last day in April 2017. We just had the tank filled for $700+. When my husband called to give final day, unem mersma said they could "ping" it, they did and it was at 58%. My husband requested a tefund and we were told when new tenants pay for their 1st order we would (should) receive our refund in the mail. We never received it. I called, my husband called and I was told that my husband didn't request or refund that was due to us ($350). I told them "no" that's not right, my husband would never walk away or give up equity. It's our money! 1 year layer finally talked to a manager? He said there are no notes on our acct. Showing we called and what was said. We even went to the office all we got was "awaiting approval, it's in the mail. It doesn't show we went directly to the office. I told mgr that they needed to hire new office staff evidently no one is doing their job. Then as a final insult this mgr said " I just can't everyone's word for what they paid and when"
VAN UNEM MERSMA HAS STOLEN OUR MONEY AND THEY REFUSE TO GIVE IT BACK. Btw, we even have receipts.
What can we do? They are no better than the average scamartist.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

You are charged a tank rental fee yearly, and if you switch over to another company or you have the tanked removed you are charged a fee for coming to pick the tank up.  Approximately $115 fee.

Ridiculous and if I would have known this prior to signing up I would not have....< /Review>

We have been customers for quite a few years now and are very pleased with their service, the prices and the quality of the people on VUM team.  We upgraded to a 500 gallon tank so we can fill once per year when prices are the lowest.  We use the monthly pre payment plan so there is plenty of money when it is time for a fill.  We also have an RV so we swing by and fill the propane tank at the VUM low rates.  Of course, we get our 3 bar-b-que propane tanks filled there too!  Every time we ask for serive with are treated like vip s !  If you are not yet customers, join Rancho Calaveras Property Owners Association and get the lowest of the lowest possible rates!</Text>

Just wanted to take a moment and thank Sabina for taking care of my eyebrow. I'm very particular about my eyebrow because it's very light colored and I've thin hair.I don't trust anyone but ladies from Eyebrow Threading. I had a very thin eyebrow but wanted to grow it thick beautifully. Steps by steps leaving some hairs to be grown for the shape I wanted,They exactly knew what they were supposed to do.Now I can leave my brow natural without using any eyebrow pencil.It's thick as I wanted. I've been doing my brows with them ever since I moved to California. Quick service,friendly Staff,good price.

Thank you for the service ladies. Highly recommended!!!<//text>

The environment was calm and nice and open. The lady was very nice! I got my whole face done - I am a natural light blonde so I have lots of fine hairs ALL OVER my face.

Never like to leave bad reviews but I'm highly upset with quality of her work. BECAUSE IT COSTED ME MY EYEBROWS! It was my first time so I had anyone do them thinking they all had a good work. I told the lady THICK, because I had been growing them out for a month. When I saw the finished product I almost cried. I would not RECOMMEND this place if you want thick eyebrows!<//review>

I was so mad!!!!!!!! I have been there a couple of times. Its a hit and miss with these people. I was happy the at first then on my last visit I think she made a mistake instead of telling me she just made my eyebrows super thin! I have been growing them out and was finally at a point where I it looked good with out filling them in. I asked her why so thin she didn't answer. I asked her what dose a touch up mean? Why would I come in with thicker brows and want super thin without telling you? I will not go there again and it smells weird too!< /Text>

< Review>
Lynn is good at explaining everything to me. I trust Lynn with what she is telling me. She is always doing the extra for the customer service experience part of the service. The tech's have always done a good job and they leave my car messy.<//Review>

<resp>None</resp><Text>Compared to the Capitol Hyundai Service department, I would say the service- department crew is very respectful and welcoming. I would do my business when it comes to my Hyundai's services and maintenance through Steven's Greek location from now on. It was my very first visit, and Eric was incredible, friendly, respectful, and transparent in regards to discussing my car issues. I would never go back to Capitol Hyundai for services matter.</Text><name>Yasmin Khalili< /name></record>

DO NOT service your car here!

I had the first service for my brand nee Genesis here and when I got got the car, I saw a scratch on the rim. No one did accept the responsibility of damaging the rim and they asked me I should pay for it if I wanted it fixed.< /Review>

Had a great experience with Moe and Joseph. They were kind and didn't push us to make a decision and answered all of our questions. Our options were laid out clear and there were no hidden charges which is breath of fresh air when it comes to dealership experiences goes. Thanks again<//Text>

<text>Best dealer!

I was so nervous since it's the first experience for buying a car in my life. But it turns out so successful. All personals that I met in Sevens Creek Hyundai were so nice, friendly, and explained whole steps in detail-also I got a good deal. I really appreciate their kindness and patience! And the car that I bought from them is working amazingly 👍< /text>< pics>

<text>I feel I am a Brand Ambassador of Hyundai, and as such a proud owner of a 2020 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited.
This car has exceptional performance and technological advancements and is comparable to the flag ship cars of Mercedes, BMW and Audi

Stevens Creek Hyundai lives up to the reputation of Hyundai cars itself and services them at the highest levels that matches any of the luxury car flagships.

I am proud to own a Hyundai car, and even prouder that Eric and team are my service managers at Stevens Creek Hyundai.

Best,  Dr. Kris Murthy<//text>< pics>

Pathetic Service. Google should allow 0 stars. I took my car in for service and specifically stated that there was a pungent odor coming from the air conditioner (the very reason I took the car to get serviced) and that I would like to get it fixed. The person who spoke to me CATHAL ENNIS, said that changing the cabin air filter will take care of it. A week later, the pungent odor is still there after the cabin air filter was replaced, for 81$. We drove all the way from San Mateo and rented a car because they don't even provide a loaner car. Wasted so much time for nothing. On calling the service center manager he was so reluctant to take any feedback. May be they can go to the Stevens creek Mercedes and learn how to fix this properly, as they had fixed a similar issue in my C300 within minutes. I don't know how they have posters saying No.1 in customer service in their office when the reality is pathetic.< /review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>I went there for a free service recall.
3 parts:
1. Web site scheduling 5 stars
2. Phone call to the shop to find out  how long it would take to perform the test and upgrade. 1 star.  The lady answering the the phone showed no interest in finding the answer.  My call was not returned.  When I called again, I got an answer, but no apologies for weak customer service behavior.   At that point I would not have returned there.
3.  On site experience. It couldn't have been better.  Cahall Ennis, was efficient and friendly, offering help beyond his duties.

Bottom line.  I will go again, but I would not mind talking to the service manager to help him running a better team.  Let see if he/she cares to call me.

After response from Hyundai.
The Manager called me a day or two after the posting above.  Extremely polite and apologized many times.  He was to take action for better training where due with the new employee.  I could not have expected better conversation or response from Stevens Creek Hyundai.<//Review><response>None< /response>< pictures>

Hyundai the company had a promotion running for getting $50 gift card for driving any Hyundai. I did just that and the salesman told me "we have a little bit of a problem with that with Hyundai" and the $50 never materialized. What did come true is a huge Hyundai scandal where they lied about fuel economy, got sued and then made some payments to owners (same happened to Honda with Civic hybrid never delivering fuel economy). Hyundai is a bit of a mess of a company as its still behind the Japanese, and as my kids babysitter who owns a Sonata said it's unbelievable that there were 12+ recalls on the Sonata engine alone and they ended up replacing its engine. New engine = good, Hyundai engine = no good as you kill time on all the endless recalls. I rented an Elantra for 3 weeks once- an all around good car with horrible unsafe suspension- the car jumps on highway speeds. Would I pay full pop for  a new Hyundai- no way! Would I buy a used one? Only under warranty. Is Hyundai a keeper. Don't kid yourself, it's not a Toyota. Problem is "they have a little bit of a problem with themselves". Is there anything I like about Hyundai? Sure thing- they put a load of pressure on the Japanese and Toyota makes better products now.< /Review>

Stevens Creek Hyundai is Great.  I have no problems with this location or services Department.  I have not dealt with their sales team so I can not comment.  I will say the dealer I bought the vehicle from Centereach Hyundai, the sales team was great.  The finance department on the other hand is Bull$hit.  They sold me a service plan for oil changes (shouldn’t have to pay a dime they said) and it was the furthest thing from worth it if you move out of the area.  I was able to use it in Round Rock, TX and Eugene, OR but not California and the dealer has done nothing to help me rectify the situation.  Do not buy a service plan unless you plan to stay in the area.  Corporate Hyundai tells me they do not regulate what dealers sell so ultimately they don’t care either.  What I have to say to that is, I have ZERO brand loyalty.  May not ever buy a Hyundai again.</Review>

I brought my ionic in back in June for prepaid service.  Eric noticed that I was close to 75,000 miles.  After that no more free services.  He got me an appointment a month later so I could get my last service completed which included a number of important tests and fluid changes and whatnot.  The whole team there is always great, no matter who I work with.  The service department is top notch!<//Review>

I went in for a non urgent warranty fix on our Veloster.  The experience itself was uneventful which would be reason enough to be satisfied.  But its been awhile since I have been to a business where people were going above and beyond their jobs.  Lynn in service had me laughing from my first phone call.  The man that checked in my car was so positive about his job and life, it was refreshing.  Thank you for all being so human, and personable.<//Text>

The customer service was excellent but, the wait time to get your car returned to you takes a long time. I had an appointment at 8am and it was done at 4:40pm! My daughters car had the same service at Toyota dealership it only took 3 and half hours! Hyundai need to improve on this.<//text>

The customer service and willingness to help was well above expectation.
However, I don't trust their mechanic's suggestions or his / her analysis.
Early this year (March 2020) I experienced a problem with my car and noticed water and oil are mixed in the radiator.

I took the car to my Mechanic and dealer ship and both claim the problem is head gas gate.The dealership took the car and worked with Hyundai (due to some prior re-calls) and supposedly fix the problem (Hyundai factory request for an additional analysis and confirmed the problem is not head gas gate and it is something else),

I left the car with the dealership to repair. After few days they claimed the car is fixed and return the car. The repair cost partially paid by Hyundai (due to prior re-calls) and I was charged for $350 and I was told they checked everything and the car is totally fixed.

After 3 months and about 150 miles (due to Covid-19 I work from home and don't drive that much) I checked the radiator and engine oil and both were totally empty (There were no antifreeze or oil drop in my dive way where the car was parked).

I return the car back to dealership after a day they call me back to tell me  the antifreeze is licking from the upper radiator  hose and suggested to change the upper and the lower hose for the price of about $650.

I did not trust their finding since few months earlier (March 2020), I replaced the radiator hose and I knew that can't be the reason.

Therefore, I took the car to my own mechanic and he checked the radiator with the pressure cap and determined the problem is the lick from the radiator itself and indicate this problem is related to the previous issue and should have been fixed before.

Summary,
Stevens Creek Hyundai refuse to check or accept the problem is the radiator itself and not the hose.
I believe this dealership will fix your car if is under Manufacture re-calls but also they propose unnecessary repairs and make the customer to pay for services that they may not need.</Text>

1st, salesman Cody tried to played smart by telling me "out of the door" price doesn't mean anything, monthly payment does! Lol.

2nd, he said that if I had $17k down payment, he'd buy a washer!

After all, never come back here with this kinda customer service. What a waste of time!< /text>

<Text>They are out of compliance with the BAR, the Bureau of Automotive Repair, and the IRS for not maintaining copies of what was sold to me. They are also out of compliance with the county of Santa Clara for not posting their “Social Distancing Protocol”.
In 2017 when I purchased my Hyundai Ioniq Plug in, I raved about how great this dealership was. They gave me the best price with no hassle. This year, when I totaled the vehicle, and I needed their help to cancel my maintenance plan, I was an inconvenience. The GAP coverage I purchased from them, did not fully pay off my loan due to the maintenance plan I purchased from them. Like many other people, I misplaced the documentation and was hopeful that they would be able to find me. After all, allegedly, I was able to go to ANY Hyundai in the nation for service with the maintenance plan. I called on a Friday, 12/11/2020 at 2:30 pm and left a message with the receptionist, who said that Finance was super busy, and she is hopeful they would get back to me by EOD. By EOD, Marvi from Finance gave me a call and let me know of the items I needed to bring in, in person. I asked if I can email them, and she said no, she gets a lot of junk email, should would rather I come in and hand deliver them. She highlighted that she is always busy on Saturdays, and I would most likely have to wait. I came in at 10:20 am, to an empty customer lot. I was taken care of promptly, to the finance office, where they were taking personal calls by the sounds of the conversation, and they were not wearing their masks. They promptly placed them back on when they saw me. The only problem with completing my transaction was that I did not have my maintenance contract, and she could not look it up. She said it was not her job to do research. I said, they should know what they sold to me, especially the finance department. I asked her how, would they know who to bill, if I came in for service? The gentlemen sitting next to her said that service has access to that information, and they do not. She said that next week she is super busy and will not be able to investigate it. She directed me to the lobby, to complete the cancellation of the maintenance plan. When I sat down, she said I need to find the information on my plan, so that she can finish processing it. I asked, can I just complete this information and you can find what plan I purchased? She reiterated that it was not her job to research, and that it was my responsibility. She said service did not have that information, even though she agreed with her partner 5 minutes prior. I got really upset and I said, of course you need to have on file exactly what I purchased from you, how else could I have received service?! She walked away from me, and before I left, she said I need to find my contract before she can complete the transaction. This is ludicrous!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<review>Unprofessional and Rude.  Lied about rear tires being misaligned and charged me for the service.  Nothing was wrong in the first place, and they ended up not changing anything.  When I asked about it, their service manager became infuriated and yelled at me for annoying him.  Don't be fooled by their repair services.  They are just trying to pick your pockets.<//review>< Pics>

My money got stolen from my wallet. I was here today for my car Recall service and as usual, i parked my car for inspection and the gentleman who was inspecting the car after inspection asked me to walk to the office to register myself. Without realizing that i forgot my wallet in the center console I started walking to the office but within few seconds i realized that i left my wallet in the car so i rushed back to car which was being parked by the same gentleman to a parking spot, when i reached the car that gentleman came out a bit panicked which made me doubt as i was walking back to the office with my purse i checked my wallet and $200 were gone. I went back to the same gentleman and asked politely if he has taken the money then this is the time he gives me back and i won't complain but he denied. I then approached the manager and before he could speak to me the same gentleman had some talk in a closed room with the manager and the manager came out to me and listen to the problem. Without any help he straight away said that he cannot do anything, his employee doesn’t steal and he is not going to give me $200. Wow, I felt like I did not accuse anyone yet of stealing as I did not have proof and was just asking to check the camera footage and then he says the cameras do not work since 2009 when they took over the building, and that's it. I called 911 but the officer was also not able to help as i did not have proof that I had $200 in my wallet and I cannot prove that my money was stolen.

I am going to definitely complain to Hyundai about it but looking at the attitude of the manager I am never walking back here again

Please be careful guys</Text>

I have consistently had great service at Stevens Creek Hyundai. They have taken good care of my car and one time helped me without an appointment on a Saturday morning. The prices are fair and I never feel like they are trying to get me to do unneeded work.<//Text>

My Daughter bought a Certified Pre-Own car and unfortunately the timing belt busted the following day as we were heading to San Francisco where my daughter lives and goes to school.   Thankfully Mike Rhodas  and Eric  was able to take us right away and had her car service and ready the following day!<//Review>

Windshield fluid is also bone dry.  My 2017 car was perfectly fine prior to them touching it.  Not sure why they are trying to blow up my engine.<//Review>< Pictures>

I would not go here for work, especially they want to charge an inspection fee of 215.00 ontop of parts and labor other mechanic shops don't do this, shame on the dealership especially during covid 19 when people are losing their jobs

Shop around people.</Text>

From beginning to end she made the entire process seamless and without a hiccup! On December 1 my engine started to make a knocking sound and would just shut off. I called Capitol Hyundai originally to make an appointment to have my car looked at and they said the soonest they would be able to get me in would be December 17, after I explained that I need to use my car every day to get to and from work as well as take my daughter to school they let me know that that was still The soonest that they could do, they had no compassion and no empathy towards the stress of the situation.  I reached out to Stevens Creek Hyundai in right away and Lynn knew exactly what I was talking about and was able to provide compassionate customer service! She sounded like she really understood how important it was for me to get my car looked at sooner rather than later since my job depended on it,  she had me have my car towed in that same day and was able to get it looked out within the next day or two - and come to find out my engine was under warranty and a recall so my engine was completely replaced for free! During this time Lynn made sure that I was set up with a rental car through enterprise, and again that whole process was seamless... not one issue! On top of that, my car was complete in 3-4 DAYS. DAYS!!! I thought it would at least take 1-2 weeks, and I was shocked!  I really want to say thank you to the entire team at Hyundai for understanding and for getting my car taken care of in such a short amount of time!  I will be bringing my car here for all of my future service, and have recommended friends as well... ask for Lynn or Eric :-) they are amazing!!!</text><UserId.>105121903580552575840< /UserId.>< pics>

Stepped these guy's up to a 4. Took my son's car there because of a code that wouldn't let it smog.  Had to bring it back and the Service Rep took care of it first thing when we got there... yes they made a mistake, but they took care of it right away. Thank you SC Hyundai.< /Review>

<Text>This is a follow up on my earlier comment dated Saturday July 18, 20 Michael Rhodas, service director of Stevens creek Hyundai contacted me on Sunday and offer to resolve the misunderstanding,.  The offer was to take the car to dealer ship and have them re-examine the car and if their should be any problem they will fix it with the minimum financial impact to me. So, I took the car today (07.21.20) and the mechanic checked it and confirmed the problem is the Radiator. Michael kindly offered me to fix the car with the fraction of actual cost. I took their generous offer and will take the car to them tomorrow to be fixed. I do greatly appreciate Stevens Creek Hyundai, Michael Rhodas, and Eric for being so concern to insure I will be a happy customer.

<rating>5<//rating><review>Stevens Creek Hyundai never fails me . I bought my car here on a whim in 2013, and any time I've come back for service, they have maintained the same level of professionalism , as well as quality of standards. I will forever sing their praises.

This most recent interaction reminded why I keep coming back .

I have since moved away from the area and I decided to come to San Jose randomly.  During my visit , I decided to get my car serviced , as it was due. I am not too fond of my local Hyundai dealer, so I back to Stevens Creek I went. I was greeted by Paul , who was so friendly and personable, I felt like he was an old friend . After my car was checked in to Valet, I then went inside and worked with Eric Y. He noticed its been some time since I have been in, of course due to moving away , but he took the time to check my file, and noticed I had pre paid for a service from MORE THAN 5 YEARS AGO ! He told me I had one left and I was so shocked that he took time to look that up , and save me money . It was amazing. I ended up needing a new battery and a new bulb, and of course,  I had no problem adding that on . I walked in there fully planning on spending a ton of money but Eric went out of his way to ensure I was saving money . I will gladly drive the 1.5 hours to see them next time I need servicing and I KNOW my experience will be the same as I have had in the past . Thank you Stevens Creek for making me a customer for life !< /review>< UserId.>

Although there was a bit of a wait, the staff was very accommodating and nice. I went in for a engine software update; They are very knowledgeable and told me what this update to my engine will entail. Overall, I had a great experience and will go back to them for any maintenance and/or problems I encounter in the future.</Text>

Love Stevens Creek Hyundai - incredible service from beginning to end!  My engine had a catastrophic engine problem before Christmas and, long story short, they replaced my engine and paid for my rental car while it was being fixed.  No only that, Mike and Eric (and the rest of the service department) couldn't have been more friendly and professional through the process.  Love this place!</Review>

<text>We went there to buy a new car. I made a appointment for test drive through online and had a confirmation call with them the day before we went there. But guess what? We arrived there on time and they just let us wait for an hour because all salespeople were busy with other customers. Then whats the point of the appointment? 🤷‍♀️ when the one salesman was available finally after an hour, we just came out. Never do the business with the person who thinks the appointment is not a big deal!

Plus, people in the building don’t wear masks in this COVID situation... oh man do you really wanna go there? So we just went to the Hyundai in San jose where the service is way better.<//text>< Rating>

I do my scheduled maintenance at this dealership for more than two years by this time. Never had any problems, work always done in reasonable time while I wait in a big armchair. Had only one small problem (trunk latch) in my car after 60k miles, and the service adviser went out of her way to get it fixed on warranty. I can definitely recommend this dealership.<//Review>

I got called by Hyundai to address a recall, and figured I would also get some squealing and a rattle checked out, an oil change, and my breaks changed. Unfortunately, Stevens Creek is the nearest Hyundai and an hour from where I live. Thankfully, Lynn here was incredible. She understood what I wanted to check out, she worked with me to save some money and secure some coupons, and they did a fantastic job addressing each of my issues.

I'll be honest, I had some negative experiences with the Colma and Burlingame Hyundai (both of whom have now closed) and I'm thrilled how good the Stevens Creek Hyundai was. Thanks Lynn!< /Review>

My first service experience with Stevens Creek Hyundai was very good, it was completed on time with no inconveniences to me. I also liked the small service charge.< /Review>

I was sold on the Hyundai Genesis and was/am seriously considering one.

After a lot of research, it came down to the color.  I was torn between Casablanca White, Empire State Gray, and the Montecito Blue.  I stopped by the dealership on a Sunday to see the different color options in person.

As I drove by the nice Mini, Infiniti, BMW dealerships, the Hyundai dealership looked like an used car lot.  A bunch of old used cars in the front with no customers on a Sunday and sales men chatting outside with hands in their pockets.  I had a flash back to a bad memory I had with Mitsubishi and realized it was the same lot Mitsubishi used to be.

Why not put your flag ship cars (Hyundai Genesis) which is a beauty in the front?  Maybe half of the lot facing the street could be used cars and the other half could showcase Hyundai's popular cars lined up?  Since there was none, my impression was that this dealership doesn't carry much inventory.

Why are the cars facing AWAY from oncoming traffic?

It made someone that was interested in buying a Hyundai not interested.  Do you think someone that would not be interested in a Hyundai want to stop by when they are driving through Stevens Creek?

Still loving the value of Hyundai especially with that 10 year warranty.<//Text><Time>1483172340085</Time><userid>114898773079011299060<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a replacement key and fob. Was quoted a price and was called when the ordered parts arrived. Was told that the fob needed programming. Was not told that programming would require a separate visit nor another $200. I ended up having to make a second 45 minute trip to this location to get a refund.<//Text>

Super smooth oil change :-). I booked an appointment in advance. They had my name when I checked the car in. Waited for the oil change, and it was done in less time than I expected. They even used an online coupon that gave me a better discount than the paper coupon I had! Excellent & Very Friendly :-).

Second experience was with 7.5K service. I booked the appointment in advance. Check-in was a breeze. I reported a warranty item (alignment) and they added it to the list of items to check. Took the shuttle back, driver was very courteous and nice. Got a call when car was ready, shuttle picked me up in about 10-15 mins. They fixed the alignment issue (it was very slight) under warranty and I picked up the car. Everything was very smooth and everybody was very courteous and friendly :-). Another Excellent Experience.<//Text>

This is my 4th Hyundai Vehicle purchased and serviced at Stevens Creek Hyundai in the last 3 years. I normally wait while service is in process. My latest schedule did not allow this. I signed up for the shuttle. After signed in, the service adviser said we can have your service completed in an hour. I accepted and was given this. Worked out for all. Thank you.< /Text>

Great place and great service. I had dropped in to check the deals for July 4th and  Willie was Phenomenal. He helped me in showing around the inventory and help pick the best deal for me. And Sean, the finance guy was great as well. He explained all details on the car. This is a great service dealership & great customer service.< /Text>

I walked into Hyundai and wanted to ask questions but sadly there was a group of 4 people sitting in a back room and didn't acknowledge me. I repeatedly made eye contact with a couple. I waiting a few minutes before deciding to just walk over and ask for help. I was surprised when a lady said someone will be out in a bit as they proceeded to just chat. I stayed either way and sat in a couple showroom vehicles. Both nice but nothing crazy special. No once asked me my name. Building out of date a bit. I decided not to buy obviously. Price point was a big high for what it was. Wouldn't return here.<//Review>

I had a wonderful experience buying a new 2020 Hyundai Palisade because of Daniel. He went above and beyond to find me the car I wanted. I called every Hyundai dealership within 50miles of where I live and no one had the car i wanted or was willing to help me find it until Daniel answered at Steven's Creek. He worked with me for about a week & finally found my car in Stockton & went to get it for me. I am really happy with my car & the customer service i received while working with Daniel.<//Text>

I had an appointment for a service at 11 am. Got a half day PTO to take my car to the dealership for the service. Left the dealership around 11:30. When I came back around 4 pm, my car was still untouched. At 5 pm, the guy who got the key from me earlier that day showed up and said they did not have time to service my car!!!! Seriously?? My car was there for almost 6 hours and you did not have time??!! The excuse was even worse. I should have brought my car to the service center between 7 am and 10 am. 11 am was too late!!! Then why did you even give me an appointment? Why did you accept my car?!!
Wasted one day at this place and they even did not look at my car!!
I wish I could give zero start to this service center!
I wish I could report this to some manager or something. But I cannot do anything other than writing a review!
DO NOT recommend this service center at all!<//Text>

<Text>If your planning to get you car service at this place please don’t . This ppl will just empty your pockets. For just oil change they charged me $700.. but At following place I got it for $89 I advise you guess to try Hyundai at 1050 Capitol Expressway Auto Mall, San Jose, CA 95136. You will definitely realize the difference.< /Text></record>

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. They are gaming you. I wanted to lease the first car in the picture attached. I was told that they will hornor the price they have on the website through telephone. However when I spend an hour to get there, they told me that this price is not available for me without even asking any of my personal information. Some of them said that this car is sold out already, some said only SE is available. Finally one sales person told me that this price is only for police, fire fighters and new grads (in hope that they can filter me out). However when I told them that luckly that I am a new grad, another sales man replied that this doesn't applied to new grad either. FAKE AD! VERY DISAPPOINTING!<//text>

The worst experience with ever for a potential car buyer! We went to see the Kona EV and do a test drive. The guy didn't even know how the cars options work, was rude and refused to show us another varient. He finally was ready to send us away and didn't even want to deal! We had done through homework on the car and were ready to buy. What's more is that they marked up the car price significantly and the website doesn't mention that. Typical of dealers to be non transparent. I'm shocked at my sick experience after some fantastic service from the Redwood City car dealers. They don't want to sell the cars. Hyundai should take them to task for behaving like this. He just turned us away without even going to the next step! Pathetic customer service!<//text>

Service personnel are very friendly and night drop option makes it very convenient.  I think this Hyundai dealership takes their customer service very seriously.

Absolutely no problems dealing with a minor cosmetic warranty covered issue.<//review>

Good experience! Just stopped in to take a quick look at an Ioniq. I am not from the area and was not going to purchase one, but Uzi was awesome. He was generous with his time, very friendly, and even let me test drive one! He was so helpful- I kept telling him that I wouldn't be buying a car, but he was a super cool, class act anyway! Thanks Uzi!< /review>

<Review>Just bought a Cadillac Escalade at Hyundai. Daniel is THE only reason we got the car. What a great guy! We came in short on time and patience with 2 babies crying, we wanted that car but It was in the back, not ready.
Daniel fought for this deal to come through! He dealt with. Our circumstances , the heat and got us a great deal!
I would buy again just bc of him!!<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808fca8fbfba8ce1:0xa79bcdd52376478b</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
We were visiting from out of town and had a strange noise develop in our Hyundai. They were all booked up, but the service center guy took a look at it for us and told us what was causing it. We were relieved to hear it was nithing major and the car was drivable. He wrote down the part numbers we will need when we get back home. Then when we told him where we were going sightseeing he told us all the best things to see and do. We were really blessed by their service and concern for us!< /Review>

Their online price looks like baits to bring in buyers. Please call them before going and confirm prices, please do not believe their online price. My experience is not good, they are not able to answer pricing details and very arrogant in behaviour when asked for clarity in details. Really felt bad after visiting this dealer. I am looking for other dealers. Please don’t waste your time dealing with this dealer.<//Text>

<text>You are looking to spend a good chunk of money to buy a new car? You want good customer service from car salesmen who know everything about the car you are looking to buy? You will find better service and knowledge from a fry cook at Burger King.
We went to test drive a Hyundai Kona EV over the weekend, there were hardly anybody to greet us, once we got into a car for test drive, the salesman wanted us to turn around within a minute or two since others were waiting to buy the car. We go back to the office and he tries to pressure us to get the car by saying we are the right kind of people for the car and he will sell it to us instead of the others if we bought it right there and then. He also continued to berate the corporate guys who put up a Test drive a Hyundai and you get $50 gift card. Such a waste of time</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Be sure to read this review before you buy a car here. They are big fraud who advertise click bait ads to attract the customers only to tell them that the internet price is not real. They have clearly classified all the discounts online and yet they claim that it's a technical glitch, we've raised a report few days back, though the "glitch" is been sitting there for months. They finally told a $2000 more quote than the advertised one. BIG FRAUD!</text>

Made an appointment with this dealership to test-drive the Genesis G70, and was greeted by Khaled, who knows this car inside and out.  He arranged 2 test-drives for me to experience the difference between the 2.0T and 3.3T.  This car doesn't disappoint!  The entire buying and price negotiation is pleasant.  All the pros and cons were explained by Khaled (quite an honest salesman I would say), and I took home the G70.  Also want to give a shout out to Willie as he has been super helpful.</Text>

****BEWARE VERY SKETCHY*** This place is what gives buying a car from a big dealership a bad rep. E-mailed interested in a pre-owed Jeep advertised on the internet, received no call, just an e-mail that indicated the vehicle was sold. Then two days later I still see the vehicle advertised on the web so I decided to call, then was told that it is there. Tried to get information and give them my trade information, and if it worked I would give them a deposit over the phone to hold because I'm two hours away and didn't want to waste a trip in case the car wasn't there or waste my time with some salesman giving me the run around, but I didn't have too.. unfortunately that's exactly what I got. Three days and two sales people later still the run around with no answers! They kept saying "we're very busy with clients" and also too busy asking what my credit score is when I told them I'm a cash buyer, and yet would not provide final numbers or clear on what their fees are? Always giving me some story, I got this from two salesman, David and Daniel.  I called again asking to speak with a Sales Manager figuring that maybe the Manger would take selling cars more seriously and he would give my inquiry and information to a salesman with more time on their hands, but when you call back another salesman picks up and refuses to transfer the call to a Manager and wants me to start the entire process again when I'm already in their system....., that's how I got to the second sales person, promised he would help me, when I told him which car I was interested in on their inventory, I once again was given the run around, I think they no longer have the car and just want me to drive for two hours to convince me on another vehicle or something, I'm so confused..... I don't want another vehicle I called about the Black Jeep Grand Cherokee they have on their lot, I'm not a Hyundai customer, and at this point they have left a very sour taste in my mouth to want to move forward with anything when it didn't even start. It appears their approach is to exhaust the customer and take the fun out of buying a car, and they succeeded, congratulations to David and Daniel the two sales people I've spoken with, and neither could sell me a car.</review>

< Review>
I recently purchased a used 2016 Hyundai Genesis Coupe, and unfortunately I had an issue with the trunk latch. As the car was still under warranty I decided to have it fixed at a dealership before my mother was coming into town on the 21st. The gentleman helping me out was the assistant service manager Eric Yaeger. As I dropped off the car he was incredibly curt with no tact, telling me I spoke too quickly and unclear. I was incredibly put off by his behavior, which was rude for someone that was dealing directly with customers. He told me it would be done at the end of the day.

The service center closed at 6pm, and I hadn't received a phone call by 5pm, so I called them. They didn't answer and I was worried as I hadn't prepared a mode of transportation if they hadn't finished my vehicle. He finally called me to tell me that the part wasn't available and I could come get my vehicle. On the way there he called back to tell me they couldn't close my trunk so I had to get a rental. I was then taken to a nearby Enterprise where they did not have any comparable Hyundai cars available. Eric had assured me they would take care of it and when I called him he said to have "Samantha do the usual". Enterprise informed me that she had been fired due to this practice of loaning out cars that weren't Hyundai and writing them off as Hyundai. Sketchy, as heck.

I went back to pick up my house keys which I had forgotten there on Friday and noticed that my windshield had 2 deep cracks in it that were not there before. When they had taken my car they had marked all the spots with issues, and it had not been marked. One of them was so deep it went through to the inside of the car. There also was a lot of trash that had been put into my trunk. I was not pleased they were using it as a refuse bin. I informed Eric who told me that they were not responsible for anything that happened to my car. I was incredibly irritated and now worried for the rest of my car as it was sitting out in the middle of their lot.

Eric told me my car would be ready on Monday, which unfortunately was midway into my mom's vacation, but I tried to keep positive. Around 5pm on Monday I hadn't received a call so again I had to call Eric. He told me that he had JUST received the part right then and it wouldn't be done today. I asked him if he was going to call me when it was done on Tuesday, and he said "Of course, how would you know to come pick it up?". Well, he hadn't called me the last 2 times so I had very little confidence he remembered any of his customers at all. Incredibly upset with his unprofessional behavior as I work in the service industry as a manager and I do not tolerate that behavior from myself or employees -- it is not how you get repeat customers or a good reputation.

I had also asked Eric while they had my vehicle to check if the seal needed repair on the drivers side door as I heard a whooshing noise when I drove above 40mph. When I inquired on Friday if it had been fixed Eric told me to my face that they had driven it and heard no noise whatsoever. This is a blatant LIE, as the odometer reading was 33043 at drop off and 33044 on pick up. What the heck, why would you lie to me? Just tell me you hadn't checked it yet, or something. I absolutely hate being lied to and I was incredibly disappointed, as I still have the whooshing noise.

I did pick up my car today, and as it was sitting out in the dusty lot the entire 6 days, it was dirty as heck. So far the trunk does work, a silver lining. Long story short, I have seen a lot of reviews touting other Hyundai dealerships over this one. I had not checked reviews prior to taking my car here, but I wish I had. Not only was my car damaged but the assistant service manager lied to my face about checking out an issue I had asked for, and in general was rude as hell. Take your car here if you don't mind 0 communication, poor service, and collateral damage. Now I'm going to go clean out the trash in my trunk and pay $200 to fix the cracks in my windshield. Thanks Hyundai Stevens Creek. Never again.<//Review>

< Review>
TLDR: don’t trust the online pricing from this dealer. It’s only meant to get you in the door. Also we seemed to have an unusually large amount of trouble with basic paperwork here. Come in ready to do everything in one visit because the two sales teams we worked with were vastly different from one another.

The full story:

1st visit: wanted to test drive a Kona. Wandered around the lot and inside for 10 minutes and nobody noticed us, so we left. They were busy as it was a weekend. No hard feelings, just a note.

2nd visit: again wanted to test drive the Kona. Had a pleasant experience, but the price was marked up 15% above MSRP due to “market adjustments.” So I pulled out my TrueCar/USAA quote for about $3000 under MSRP. Sales manager said he could honor that price (and boasted about how they have the best pricing in Northern California), offer 2.9% financing, and give me $800ish for my trade-in. I didn’t have the title for my trade in with me or my checkbook, so I said I’d come back tomorrow to finish (big mistake) after the handshake agreement on basic terms.

3rd visit: we came in ready to sign the papers and head out. When we got there, it was a completely different sales team. They’d lost all our paperwork and we had to start over. Suddenly they couldn’t honor the TrueCar price anymore, trade-in value would only be $300, and financing at 7% and only $3000 down. The sales manager from the 2nd visit called in to tell us that basically he was quoting us the best possible outcome for each component of the deal, not what could actually work together, because we seemed undecided. We walked out.

4th visit: came back in ready to fight. This time both the sales teams were there. We had written down both offers and basically told the sales team to give us one of them. They opted for the worse offer and sent us in to the finance director’s office, where we would spend the next 3 hours. Not too far into things, I asked to see the final deal written out, just to make sure we were aligned. The first one they showed me was for the wrong car, and it took a while to get it done for the right one. When the right paper came, the deal was still wrong. They were still trying to charge us well over the price I thought we’d agreed to. We also qualified for additional conditional discounts (recent grads and previous Hyundai owners) which should have been applied. Enter the sales manager who we then had to argue with to get close to the price we had been anticipating. Turns out that the problem was twofold: the MSRP on TrueCar was understated, and the dealer had no knowledge of the discount amount TrueCar was giving. As the consumer, this seemed like a “them” problem. I was not inclined to fork over more money because of their issues with marketing. Finally we agreed to the TrueCar price, but that included the $900 of conditional discounts that came in after the fact. We were finally able to sign the papers and drive off with the car.

In summary, we did not have a great experience here. I’m happy that we were able to get the price we did and sympathetic to the dealer that it was under their invoice price. But the whole place seemed very disorganized, both on the pricing/TrueCar fiasco and messing up the paperwork multiple times throughout the process. I also didn’t like that the dealer had bumped up the sticker price to 115% of the original MSRP or that they forced us to take on a really bad loan (which I refinanced elsewhere literally the next week).</Review>

Okay service, you must book ahead or take a gamble by coming very early in the morning.  Note that diagnostic fees can be somewhat high.< /Text>

Guys, respect the customer who likes to walk in.. I went there today to see the cars that were listed in the offer. Came to know after visiting the office that, of the five cars listed four were sold out . There is only one car left that i liked and i asked him to show me the car. This guy just showed his hand that the car was standing out and asked me to look the car myself. Not even a courtesy to come near the car, even after we waited for 10 mins. When i entered the office back, i see that these guys were chit chatting. You imagine how they are treating the customer. I should have finalized my vehicle today, if they were good at selling. Poor guys.. No more visit. Even if i pay few bucks extra, i will travel few more miles away.. Learn to respect customers and earn business friends.!!!. Also update the website so that we don't have to visit your store.< /text>

They make it happen.

I am beyond happy with my purchase but I came there not even knowing I was going to buy a brand new Hyundai. I came there looking to purchase a used car, and I came from Sacramento to purchase it.

When things didn't look like it was going to happen because of my limited options for a loan, Moose, the financial manager, made something better of the situation.

The staff there was friendly, and my sales representative Ayar was very thorough with what my limited options were. In the end, they gave me a great deal with a better car than I expected to take off with.

My sincere thanks to everyone who helped me buy my first brand new car. These guys are next level.< /text>

Told them that airbag light came on right after your "service", but they refused to take responsibility!
I don't trust their service because obviously they didn't do a good job on the first service (specially for such a sensitive part), and also they are not taking responsibility for the damage they have done!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Here’s an update-
we went to Hyundai Capitol after Stevens Creek. I wonder why their services are having such a difference between each other. One thing worth mentioning is that Capitol Hyundai is much more larger than Stevens Creek, i see no reason to go to a smaller dealership while they have not enough inventory, not knowledgeable enough, no attitude. We were not allowed to test drive Sonata 2020, the Elantra we test drove was the SE version, because thats all they have in Hyundai Stevens Creek, and the sales person mentioned that the sports version of Elantra is not released yet, well, this is definitely NOT true. We were able to test drive Sonata 2020 at Capitol Hyundai and they also have the Elantra sports in the showroom, eventually we manage to test drive both cars. We were treated fairly and we are now getting paperwork ready for the purchase.

To the salesman in Stevens Creek: You not only lost a customer, you are losing your branch reputation at the same time. I hope you are watching this review and hopefully no one will be treated like this again because no one really deserves it. Don’t forget your customers are the one who pay for your commissions.

Original review-
Would give them negative five stars if i can. We had an appointment with the manager and she assigned us to a sales person which doesn’t fit his position. You should never judge a book by its cover, I couldn’t believe the salesman can be that judgmental on my credit, you will make no sales until you change your attitude and your low class mindset. A customer who is ready to buy a car and walk into your showroom, but you had lead them out because you think people can’t afford it. What else can i say? And what do you think this experience can be? I will never walk into this showroom again in my entire life and definitely will not recommend anyone to come here unless you want to be looked down. Worst experience ever in my whole life!</Review>< Pics>

The worse exerience at Hyundai I’ve ever received. Hence I have been with Hyundai about 4 years now. I do not believe I will be continuing with Hyundai after my lease is over. I went in this morning asking to get see if my warranty covers my tire or if he would look into it. He was very lazy didn’t want to check, never looked looked up my info. I had to literally ask this guy to check please because I have a different warranty service. It was like pulling teeth. I understand that it did not cover but I was looking for great service and hoping he can at least provide suggestions. I asked to receive a quote on my tires because I was willing to wait and would like to buy my tires from Hyundai. Cahal ( not sure if I’m spelling his name correctly) told me flat out I will not look it up because I can’t get you in today. I asked if there is anyway possible he said no again without even checking. Again I understand I did not have an appointment but did not plan on being treated like this from Hyundai after my family and I has bought over 4 car.<//Text>

<Review>for regular oil changes OK. so can any corner jiffy lube do for under 50 bucks. Some of the reps will always try to up-sell filters etc just like any other mechanic, but some wont.
my main gripe is to pay 95 bucks to get AC "inspected" for a car thats covered under warranty.. that sucks big time.< /Review><rate>2<//rate>< Resp>

Good business .  Hybrid cars are bad .   Got a good deal while buying . Very helpful staff. But the car has been givig me trouble since then .   Got it fixed 4 times.in 3 years.  .  3 times they didnt charge .  4th time they made me pay.   If 1 new car has that many problems that means the company isnt doing a good job.   Happy with the dealership.  Not happy with the car.< /review>

<Text>I was ensured that everything with the used SUV I was buying was in perfect condition. After I left the dealership with my new (used) vehicle I took it to get an inspection because I noticed my car was shaking at high speeds (around 60-70mph). I called the service department at Stevens creek Hyundai (who were extremely rude to me) and I was told I would have to PAY for an oil change and multi point inspection so they could look over my car even though I just bought the car from them!!! I obviously went elsewhere and had to pay $60 just to have my tires balanced. Additionally, the day after I got my vehicle I tried cleaning my windshield and THE WIPERS WERE FALLING APART. I could not believe this. None of this should have to of been done to a vehicle that I was promised was in perfect condition.<//Text>< Pictures>

I am a class of '77 Santa Clara High School, and always had reservation about dealerships on Stevens Creek. Boy, I was wrong, the staffs were friendly and was very helpful in selecting my mother's 2018 Sonata Limited Plus model.
Hyundai has finally come to fruition into a fine automobile of choice and enjoyed the car buying experience.</review>

What’s the point of making an appointment for regular maintenance for them to take 7+ hours? 22.5k maintenance, no issues with the car, pretty routine. Dropped the car off @8am for an 830 appointment. Called around 10 to ask when the car would be done. They said in the afternoon, maybe 2pm. Get back to the device area at 220 to pick up my husbands car (who had an 815 appointment) and they tell me it will be another hour. My husband and I had reservations in Napa for 6pm, assuming that it couldn’t possibly take 8 hours for this to be done. Now we get to cancel. All of the service people were amazingly nice but it still doesn’t make sense that a routine maintenance check with no abnormal issues or additional work needs 7+ hours. Luckily I live within 20 minutes so I could go home for most of the wait time, but what would have happened if I lived further away and waited? I would have been stuck for 7 1/2 hours in their waiting room?</text>

<review>I've been bringing my 2011 Sonata here for service since I moved from MN to CA in 2012.  They have gotten much better since then, for sure.

They have always been polite and professional.  Both I, and my car, have been treated very well by them.  My 60-month bumper-to-bumper warranty that came with the car expired in May and I still choose to bring my car to them, even though I don't have to.

I've taken my current car to more Hyundai dealerships around the country than probably most of you commenting here, so you can believe me when I say they're one of the good ones.  Hyundai, in general, makes an excellent product and has generally great service support, but some locations are better than others.

They DO need to work on improving turnaround time for simple maintenance.  90 minutes for an oil change WITH an appointment is pretty routine at this place, so major maintenance will probably take longer.  Not sure why it takes that long, but that needs to be improved.  But overall, they are a great dealership and I will continue to give them business.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I was at Steven Creeks Hyundai for leasing a Santa Fe. I had an excellent experience with the staff there. I have been able to have a test drive without scheduling appointment. Sales team was very kind. I really appreciate the service of Linh in helping me out with the best trims selection. He spend time explaining all specific details of the car. I highly recommend this branch.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I've been to a variety of dealership in my life. This one has, by far, the best vibe.

I was helped quickly with a friendly approach. The focus seemed very solution oriented and service driven. I'll be driving past other dealerships to get here, but I don't care.

The service was good and now I'm loyal. No trickery, smarmy-ness, being forgotten. My perceptions were not managed, my reality WAS and now my perception is very positive. I was treated like a peer, not an idiot.

The repair took three trips when it could have been two (obscure part not available). Not a BIG deal and some of that could be a communication issue on my part.

I will be back. Good work.</text>< pics>

We spent 30mins walking around failing to get attention of any sales person. The dealership was rundown, sales personel were shying to make an eye contact, even after requesting to talk to someone, we were just bounced around. We went with a mind set to drive out Inna new car. Gosh they were lame.</review>

The sales staff is pretty hands off and not too attentive unless you need help. They take a less pressure driven approach to sales which makes it easier to kick the tires without someone telling you unnecessary facts about the car. Not all cars are filled with fuel, so we had a pretty bad experience test driving a car, but we got reimbursed for the cash we spent filling the car up. Overall, the test driving experience was OK.</review>

I had list of cars in my mind. None of them worked out well, but finally sonata worked out really well. My friend bought a car form here a month ago and he referred me to the same sales person and his name is Dave.

It was really nice experience dealing with him. He was very sensible and had good knowledge about the car. He took us for a test drive, explained every feature. I had decided that I am gonna trade in my old car and buy this. Getting a good price for my old car was bit difficult and that's expected. Dave was helpful in this too. But what matters is happy ending. I got a really good deal for the price I wanted and happy with my car. I strongly recommend this hyundai dealership. It may not be big as other dealerships around, but they have the car you want. :)< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>The service advisors are not for you. Their job is to charge you as much possible for as little as possible even though they know the car is not going to be fixed. Shady. Super disappointed. Then they call you a lier for leaving a bad review. Go somewhere else.

Also promised to check the car in one day, actually finished a week later. Car got scratched in their parking lot. Keep your money Hyundai Stevens Creek. Your business should and will die.

Hyundai Assurance my @$$. Will never buy Hyundai car ever again. Go Tesla.< /Review>< user>

The Customer representatives at the time of buying or leasing the car are super nice to you. BUT, once you have the car and you call back for any service or account related questions, you will get to face the MOST COCKY Customer representatives. They do not get back to your requests and expect you to follow up on each and every problem. But is it how Dealer-Customer Relationship should be? I high recommend not to buy/lease any car from these guys in future.Customer Service is something that should be    available at your need  anytime and not when you force them to do it for you.< /Text>

<Text>The worst service ever. No respect to their clients. All they want is to close a deal. If you not buy or lease a car you “wasted their time”. Be cautious with allowing them to check your credit rating before you agreed on a deal. Otherwise, you will go out with no car and low credit rating.<//Text></record>

<Text>For five months I’ve been trying to get my Hyundai Accent 2012 serviced by Stevens Creek Hyundai for unexplained engine burning oil. I don’t have oil leaking out of my car, and I don’t have blue or white smoke coming out of the tailpipe. I also change my oil regularly. Instead of running a diagnostic, the service advisor had my dipstick level marked. When the mileage was 37,150, the oil level was full at the maximum.  A month later on at 37,820 my oil level was already half a quart lower.
However, the service advisor said I had to bring my car in two more times to determine if my engine is really burning “enough” oil.
Although, the records show that in 670 miles the car burned half a quart of oil, the service advisor didn’t seem too concerned. I have to conclude the oil burning issue is expected and within Hyundai’s tolerance.  I now understand why the warranty is too good to be true.  Hyundai never intends to honor it.< /Text>< Pics>

As every Hyundai Dealer in California, the service is low quality. Took my car under Hyundai USA recommendations to see if they could figure out what’s going on with my car and they just called me telling me that my car has no issues. The thing is, they just plug the computer there, and if the computer don’t find an error code, that means you, the customer, you are crazy! Hahahaha don’t bring it here and don’t bring it to Serramonte Hyundai. Drive to Las Vegas to have some fun and drop it at ABC Hyundai and maybe they will give you good quality crevice!<//Text>

<Review>Always a good experience. Drop-off and the work done is never a hassle. And pick up is usually on-time. My last experience was the wrong sized part was ordered, so they put in a more expensive alternative, so I didn't have to return the next week, and the cost was still the same. They do what they can to make the customer happy.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Very happy customer - just bought an Ioniq plug-in.  Was helped by Dave Gil, who was very informative and easy to work with.  Would definitely recommend stopping by.  The Ioniq seems like a great car.  Lots of space, powerful enough, and great mpg.< /text><gmap_id>0x808fca8fbfba8ce1:0xa79bcdd52376478b</gmap_id>< user_name>

< Review>
Ayar Meza was a very patient, honest, and understanding sales rep. He explained factors behind the lease deal carefully and thoughtfully, which I appreciated. Shout out also to Paul who was equally helpful and diligent during the lease negotiation process. Paul and Ayar also stayed with me when there was an unexpected issue on a new car I had just leased and made sure it was resolved before I left. I appreciate their assistance, and Ayar offered an extra deal to compensate for the extra time that I had spent to ensure that I was satisfied. All in all, I am pleased with my new car and with the sales staff. Still have to go back next week to wrap up on my old car and will update this review if things turn out equally well!< /Review>

A day had passed and oil just started pouring out the underside of my car. This routine visit had turned into a huge problem because they did not put on the oil cap properly<//review>< Pics>

UPDATE May 2020: Nothing has changed since my previous review (see my initial review provided 2 years ago). This dealership is jedi master in terms of price gouging. Expect to pay at least 100% more in terms of repairs and replacement compared to a good local auto shop. Simply not worth it.
Cost estimations for replacing tail lights, cabin air filter, tires again were significantly higher. Either look up youtube videos and do it yourself (very easy) or just take it to a local auto repair shop (which will be far cheaper than this dealership).

2 years ago:-- Unfortunately this is the nearest Hyundai around Mountain view, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara area so they kind of have a monopoly. Not a great service in any way that you can think of. Plus don't ever think of replacing your tires here, they charge double the cost of the same outside. Just not worth the money. Labor charges are also ridiculously high.<//text>

I don't often write reviews but, I was recently with my co-worker who  purchased their Car through Stevens Creek Hyundai. They were dealing with the Service Department. Lynne  the Service Advisor was so professional and knowledgeable with attention to detail, I will seriously consider purchasing my next vehicle there. I was happy to see that not all Auto Dealers forget about customer service after you drive off the lot<//review>

< Review>
Service guys here are awesome. I had a mystery noise that other mechanics could not find... Turns out it was a AA battery that made its way into a hole under the carpet below the driver seat. They took apart the car searching for it and only charged me for a portion of the hours they spent working on it. Very happy customer</Review>

I've haven't had a positive experience at Stevens Creek Hyundai as of yet.  My last appointment for a standard oil change took a little over two hours after being told it would only be 45 minutes tops. It was obvious that they forgot about my me and my car.

And today, I dropped my car off at 8:45am for a 30k service.  I made an appointment and hoped for better service this time around.  I was told that it would require two and a half hours or so to be completed. Three hours later I called Stevens Creek Hyundai for an update and expected to hear that the service was nearly done... but guess what, James tells me that the service hasn't even begun!!!  A miss-communication caused the wrong car to be serviced.  SERIOUSLY!!! Again I'm forgotten about.  This place is a joke.  If my car wasn't leased through Hyundai I would absolutely go elsewhere.

This place doesn't follow appointments so no need to make one.  This place has terrible customer service so i would highly advise going elsewhere for any maintenance with your car

thank you< /Text>

I made an appointment here to have some repairs done to my 2012 Hyundai Genesis. Cathal was my point of contact in the service department. Cathal is professional and did a great job.

Mike R. (Service Director) great guy.  Mike did a fantastic job in overseeing my concerns with my repairs.

Sand Dollar man, Thank you for being so welcoming to my kids. My son still has his sand dollar.

Great service team! Cheers< /text>

I just had bought a 2013 Sonata limited. It is such an incredible car. I am so thrilled that I have chosen this car. I have had a wonderful experience with Hyundai dealer, in particular Ali Rashidian was very accommodating and genuinely when out of his way to make sure that I will get the deal I want, and that I would walk out with a big smile on my face and I did. He was a very diligent and professional guy. I am 100% satisfied I couldn’t be happier by my car and the amazing service I had received.<//review>

<Review>Mike, BRAVO for the 5 star service Lynn in the parts department provided me today. Lynn has restored my faith in your dealership!

THE REVIEW BELOW WAS A SNAP SHOT OF MY EXPERIENCE.
Since
Mike and I have talked a number of times and I see a HUGE difference.
Thanks for reaching out and fixing things Mike and team.

Having to deal with this service dept is not something i enjoy doing, matter of fact it's a nightmare.
The staff talks in circles and never wants to answer my simple questions.
I only wished I had done my homework on this location before I put down cash money for my car.
FAIL!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I was at the dealership last week to look at a Hyundai Genesis and a gentleman by the name of Bobby C helped me out. We did a test drive on the vehicle and the car was great! I'm looking to purchase a new Genesis, the fact that Bobby took his time to show me the vehicle inside and out says a lot about him as a sales executive and I truly appreciate that, he is a very personable guy, very professional. Stevens Creek Hyundai is very fortunate to have a sales executive with that kind of service and professionalism if you go to Stevens Creek Hyundai I recomend to ask for Bobby he will take great care of you.</text>

A+++ Customer Service from Hosni, he was patient, polite and professional. He helped me pick out the car I wanted. About 3 months later I came back again for service, Brian was also very polite and professional, and friendly. Waiting time was way shorter than I expected. Great Service! I am happy with my car...Will definitely come back for another car and service again.<//Review>

<Text>Thanks for the note mike :) .. I am upping a star for the response...and here is the reason for few stars to begin with. I came in unscheduled when i shopping for a tucson and almost none of your floor salesman who were present were interested in showing me the car or taking me for a test drive. I expected more eagerness i guess. anyways, hopefully its not always the case. best</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Worst place to buy car.
I brought brand new car from them.
And they didn't even give any service free and even after paying for service, they even didn't wash the car. My door rubber broke after 2 months and it covers under warranty by hyundai but they did not change it. Please don't buy car from them. I wish i could not even give 1 star to this dealership.</review>

I don't recommend this place

They repaired a flat tire and again got flat tire the next day, when checked for the second time they told there is a second nail which they didn't notice first time, this is not acceptable. They so called repaired it second time and again it was flat on the third day, this time they told there is a sidewall puncture which they didn't notice first two time and asked us to replace the tire, this is ridiculous. First of all I don't think they have a good technician to do repair properly, on top of it when I was inquiring about some stuff with the rep over there, he was not at all interested to answer my questions and was hurrying me to leave that place telling "You are all set, your car is here", I mean when the customer have queries they should listen first and try to answer, that is their job. Whatever that guy did was rude. I am 100% sure I will not recommend this place to anyone and 200% sure I will not come to this place again. I don't want to give 1 star too, but there is no option.<//Text>

<review>Staff is ok. The shop is really in rundown condition. They need some good upgrades. But the people are decent you should know how to deal otherwise they can be really pain in a**. Try contacting different salesman as you never know what deal you will get. I had ok experience but my friend did not had the same as his lease price went up after 2 weeks as they missed some numbers. Try to do some homework instead completely relying on them.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>bought a new car on January 16 from Stevens Creek Hyundai (4425 Stevens Creek Boulevard Santa Clara, CA 95051), but on January 19 the vehicle was broken. I called Hyundai road assistant to figure out what is going on with the car.  Then the car was towed from the garage. It's came up there was a problem with a pin connection in a fuse box. The fuse box should be replaced. I did not receiver any call-backs to follow up about the problem. When I called to the service, they told me that fuse box will be shipped within two days. I did not receive any feedback on Friday, 01/23/2015. I received a call fro the service that I had to return a rented car and they will provide me a another one. I asked about the status of my car, they did not know anything. I did not receive any feedback even on Monday, 01/26/2015! When I called, some one was on holiday and they don;t know the status. I upset on customer service. I upset on quality of the vehicles.They sold me the broken car! I will recommend to everyone  to not buy any vehicles from this dealership in any social networks. They are not good with customers. Within almost two weeks I receive only one call that Today is Feb 4 and the car still in a service, when I called them they don't know when the car will be fixed.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I rarely write reviews, but our experience here was so bad that I just had to warn other customers. I spent time browsing through other reviews and looks like our experience was not singular and most people are echoing something similar.

My wife and I were looking to buy a Sonata and we had done a lot of ground work on price options etc. We also had a couple of quotes from other dealerships so we were very clear on the price we wanted to pay.

We walked into the dealership and met a salesman called Brandon and asked him if they could beat any of the other quotes. He was a nice guy but he wasted more than an hour going back and forth between his boss and us trying to sell us the car $1000(!) higher than other quotes.

When we didn't budge his boss Antonio walked in. Antonio is one of those awful car salesman you hear about. He tried every dirty trick and every high pressure tactic in the book to badger us in buying the car at a much higher price. In the end, he came with a "Now or Never" price which was still $500 more than what other dealers were offering. When we politely refused, he yelled at us and stormed away. We were shocked for a moment and then walked out. We were in there for more than 3 hours and felt quite upset and angry.

We drove straight to Hanlees Hyundai and bought a 2013 Sonata within an hour.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Awful sales staff and service. Every time we come in for a service on our car (we now regret buying the service package, and feel that we should have pushed back more on the sales staff), we end up facing delay after delay. If they were just upfront about taking 3+ hours for new tires, we could have left and gotten food. Because they kept leading us on with one thing or another, we were stuck, waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Now comparing prices for auto services, I believe we could have gotten a much better deal elsewhere.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Friendly, knowledgeable.

On buying a new car: Only after we negotiated on price did I see that price included "theft protection" in with the document processing and other fees, so I was able to save $270 by declining that.</Text>

<Review>I had to wait about 4 months to make an appointment for a factory warranty repair of a vent fan control. When I finally got my car in for service, I did a drop-off the night before, and nobody called me the next morning so I had to track down a service advisor. At the end of the day, I was told parts needed to be ordered, which was fine since I wasn't in a hurry. At the very end of the second day, I was told my repair was done. The tech's note claimed that everything was in working order after the repair. Due to having my husband pick it up & having to immediately loan it to a friend, I didn't discover until weeks later that nothing had been fixed at all! The fan still didn't work!! Now my options are to wait another 4 months for a return visit to this dealership that has lost all my trust or to look elsewhere. Although the next-closest dealer is much further away, I guess I have to look elsewhere.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

The cars and value are phenomenal...can't be beat.  I was about to buy a BMW 535 until I drove the new Genesis 5.0 sedan.  The car is AMAZING, and costs half of what the beemer was going to.  Granted, it doesn't corner like a BMW, not much does...but its smoother, quieter, faster, better sound system, more comfortable, less costly to upkeep, and has an amazing warranty.
I've been so impressed with it that I bought a Sonata for my mother and like that just as much.

The negative review is for their staff, both sales and service.  Both are equally dismal.  After a few hours of research, I knew more than the sales people about their cars....whats worse is that I knew more than the service manager as well!  I have had 2 issues/questions regarding my car and both times I've been met with ignorance with an attitude, or what I call flat out stupidity.

Bottom line...great cars, but steer clear of the dealership if you can.</Text>

The experience was good when we went to check the price for the first time. But they committed to a price but they have changed it when we went for the second time by increasing the price about 900$ and the way the manager was talking in very arrogant. Really felt bad with the experience. Really bad respect to the customers</review>

My husband bought a new Elantra a few months ago and got a really good warranty (they fix anything wrong with the car and give him a rental).  Well, he got it serviced in Visalia CA because he has family down there and its much easier and faster to get an appointment.  During his visit to Visalia, he was told that he had a valve that was leaking and should be addressed asap.  He made an appointment for the SJ dealership at 8am (we live in San Jose) a few hours before he went to San Fran for work.  Well, the lady that helped him, LYNNE, was extremely rude.  She treated him like he was clueless and that he was trying to cheat them.  She refused to give him a rental car even though his warranty says he is allowed one, and began questioning his judgement. She asked him, "Well why would you schedule maintenance if you have to go to work?" Uh he scheduled it because the weekends are too hectic to bring the car in . Well, after his car finally got serviced, it turns out he DID have a leaky valve and that he wasn't lying.  She called him back and asks, "Tell me the history of this car, its a fun car; I used to race my car when I got a new one." She was trying to get him to confess that the leaky valve was caused by him.  I mean, what kind of racing can you do in an Elantra??? It has 120 horse power at best, which is not a lot. So after trying to get my husband to falsely admit to being rough on his car, she then finally gave him a rental car since his car wouldn't be ready till Friday.  This kind of service should not be tolerated and him and I will be taking this problem to cooperate.  It must be a bay area thing but if you ever need to get your car serviced, just go somewhere else.<//text>

I had unpleasant failure of me Elantra. For some reason it was stalling on traffic light. It was not showing error codes. They were able to fix it within a 10 days, since it was hard reproducible issue. Special thanks to Cathal, service advisor, and manager Mike, for daily updates on the vehicle. Since it was manifacturer's defect we payed 0$ for labour, parts, rental car. There only bad thing was a rental car payments, which was miscommunicated, however it at the end of the day it does not spoil 5 stars. Good job guys :)< /review>

<Text>We scheduled an appointment for some factory recall work to be done.  We were informed that the process would take about three hours, so we scheduled the appointment for 1:00 PM, believing that we'd be able to pick up the car later that evening.  When we called to check on the car at 5:00 PM, we were informed that the car would have to sit overnight, and that we wouldn't be able to pick it up until the next morning.

We were never offered shuttle service or a loaner vehicle.  We were just expected to cope without our car.  The thing that irks me most, though, is that they knew which services were being performed.  They should have informed us that the car would need to sit overnight before we brought it in so that we could make other arrangements for transportation.<//Text><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>DO NOT BUY OR LEASE CAR HERE AT THIS LOCATION. they are so rude and they are not professional AT ALL!!!! I returned my car to them. I came back after half an hour because i left my sunglasses. They first said they send the car somewhere else. When my boyfriend went inside he found out AFSHIN MOTALEBI or he put a name for himself SEAN MOTALEBI steals my sunglasses.
Do not go with him. Dont trust him!!!!!!!!!!! He pushed my boyfriend and told us to get out. And abused us the way he talk to us. I WILL FOR SURE FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE HES NOT WORKING THEIR ANYMORE. HE IS A THIEF!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the other guy he was unrespectful and he said hes the manager. Michael lopretta (all of them pretend to be the manager).I have never seen a customer service like this before in my life. For a sunglasses they abuse you. And kick you out.
I feel bad for them. When they steal a $400 sunglasses im sure they STEAL LOTS OF MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS. DO NOT TRUST THEM. THEY WILL RUIN UR CREDIT TOO. THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO RUN UR CREDIT. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!< /review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The sales people here are incredibly incompetent to the point that I almost have to laugh about it.

Last year, I visited the dealership ready to buy on the spot.  The vehicle I was interested in was blocked by another vehicle and the salesman was unwilling to move things so that I could test drive the vehicle I wanted.  I bought from another dealer in the area that same day instead.

Today, we visited because the household wanted a second vehicle - the same as the first, so this would have been a super easy sale.  Once again, we were ready to buy on the spot.  This time, we gave up after they spent an hour looking for the keys for the vehicle and couldn't find them - they lost the sale to the same dealer as the first car.</Review>

Terrible service in the "service" department. Hardly any communication between myself and them about what time to pick my car up. Had to order an Uber to take me to work because shuttle guy didn't show up, and will probably have to order another Uber from work to pick up my car because I still haven't received a call back about requesting shuttle service. Update: Still waiting for the shuttle 35 minutes after speaking to the driver. Been off work now for about 20 just sitting in the parking lot waiting. Should have just called Uber.</review>

<text>Horrible service I came in because my car had a squeaky noise, on Wednesday and Thursday I got the car. When I started to drive for an awhile the noise was still there. I came back on Monday talked with the manager Mike. He heard the noise he did not want to hear what I had to say. He even went on to say that what I heard was not a squeak, but that doesn't matter it is still a NOISE. I wanted   a rental car since I came on Wednesday of last week and the Technician should have done his job right the first time and inspected it, I even signed off for an inspection. Now I will have to take the car to Firestone because of a manager who does not want to listen to customers and thinks he knows best when he did not work on my car. Terrible manager when my sister tried to call because I was busy trying to get home safely, this manager Mike hanged up the phone when trying to explain again the situation. Mike should not be a manager has no idea how to resolve customer complaints, he just wants to walk away, this is not a manager but acts more like a sales advisor.</text><Resp>None< /Resp><Time>1526354331990< /Time>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I purchased my 2011 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 2.0T R-SPEC from Bill Ayers back in February of 2011. I was very picky about what I wanted and when I first went in they did not have the color that I wanted. They did a search throughout the state and could not find the car that I wanted. I decided to hold off on my purchase, but a week later Bill gave me a follow up call because they had just received the Karussel White R-SPEC that I had been looking for. Gave me a great deal on it without having to haggle back and forth. Overall a very pleasant experience and would definitely recommend Bill and Stevens Creek Hyundai to a friend.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>This is the worst Dealership ever. I bought 2017 Hyundai Tucson from Stevens Creek Hyundai and within a month battery got dead. I took couple hours off from office and went there for emergency service but they were asking appointment, wait all that. Finally I took my keys and came without any service and they don't even care. Service department and sales both are bulshit. When you buy the car they behind you and once sold they are like who are you....
I don't re-command this dealership to anyone, even I will stop people if someone going there.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

The worst dealer I’ve ever been in my life. I was looking for an Elantra GT sport. I went there and let the salesman know I want it. He told me he needed to talk to his manager. I was left alone there for 15 min. Although there were 3 other salesmen there, no one talked to me, or asked me if I need any help or need water. Then salesman told me “sorry sir, we don’t sell them. And there is no such car available in other dealers near here.” So Hyundai doesn’t sell this “popular” car in Bay Area? Then I ask “if I order, how long it takes to get the car?” “No, there is no estimate” replied by the salesman, and walked me out of the dealer.

During this process, he never introduced himself or asked any of my information. And never showed anything that he wanted me to buy any car from Hyundai. Just lack basic sales manors. I’ll never go to this dealer again. And I hope this dealer can survive.</Text>

I own a new Genesis with full option I like the car but their service dept and most the employees are as rude as hard to imagine. They try to charge you a lot and NOT even answering your questions.

The Hyundai warranty is  full of BS as they are telling me my stereo system and all components are only warranted for 300 miles.
The warranty is only 3 years or 36000 miles and does not cover everything ( I accept about wear and tear) but even electrical and digital is not covered. Forget about bumper to bumper or 10000 miles it is not withe car is only with original buyer.
I AVOID going to Stevens creek Hyundai as much as I can (RUDE, Unprofessional, old dealership, old service dept its like the 50 years ago garages etc) I would give the -100 on everything.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808fca8fbfba8ce1:0xa79bcdd52376478b< /GmapID></record>

I have been here two times. In turn, I got two awful experience with them.

For the first time, I got a tire pressure problem. I went to their place and they checked my car for a couple of hours and told me that everything was OK and I don't need to worry. They charged me some money. But after I came back, I still got the tire pressure problem very often. So, I went to Hyundai Burlingame instead, where those guys helped me find a small nail in my tire and fixed the problem.

I didn't come back to Stevens Creek Hyundai until Hyundai Burlingame was closed. Then, I came back again for a maintenance. I scheduled a time with them online and asked for a short leave from my company for car maintenance. But when I arrived there on time, they told me that my estimated waiting time is 4 hours and showed no regret.  I said nothing and simply left and went for maintenance in Fremont Hyundai later.<//Review>

About Bobby C.:
Bobby was not only an excellent salesperson. Bobby went above and beyond to make sure I was having the best deal on my first Hundai's purchase. What I really loved most from him is the fact that he did all,  the demonstration and transactions in Spanish (he didn't have to, but he did). Although there was no commitments made at the beginning, he was the reason why I decided to buy my first Hundai Sonata Hybrid, and I am fully grateful to him. Way to go Bobby. Keep up the good job.<//Review>

We just purchased a 2013 Hyundai Sonata and I was very pleased with Michael Vu and the service he provided us with. He was very welcoming and easy to talk to. He was also very informative with all the cars and he was openly patient with all the questions we had. My experience was great and i'm more than please with the deal on our car. I would highly recommend this ales person and Stevens Creek dealership, we are truly satisfied!</Review>

<text>I called in to book an appointment for my servicing my car and they kept me on hold for around 8 minutes. Then someone comes back to talk to you and before you say something properly , they again put you on hold without listening to you..

They have lots of cars, so you can take a look all of cars from Hyundai and get a good deal.

"Hosni Benchekroun" who is one of the car dealer will help you to find your car and give you great support.

I highly recommend you the Stevens Creek Hyundai.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fca8fbfba8ce1:0xa79bcdd52376478b< /gmap_id></record>

< review>
Had pathetic experience with their service&parts department. Wasted 2 visits and more than 5 hours of time for something that could easily be done in a single 2 hours visit. "Hyundai" wifi in the waiting room is not working, some very slow public network is the only option.

A bit more details. First time I scheduled 45K service. When I arrived, the initial inspection and paperwork was good and prompt - no complaints. I mentioned that charger port was not working, it's probably fuse, but it would be nice if they look at it. After 2 hours of waiting my car was ready. So far so good. They told me that they did a very thorough inspection and everything was OK. On my way home I was feeling that I'm driving a helicopter or something. I also realized that charger wasn't working either, but at least they didn't charged me for that ;)

It turns out one of the tires was cupped. When they moved it to front, it became much noisier. I wonder - when they rotate it, do they actually test if the tire is balanced at all? So I scheduled another appt with them. At this point, it was pretty obvious that the problem is with tires and I couldn't expect to wait 3(THREE!!!) hours for their expert to confirm that. So they put the tire back and also offered to sell me 2 tires, which I could order online with installation and save $100 just on that. And yes, they fixed this charger - it was just a fuse, but they charge me $40 to diagnose that! So I realize next time I'd rather do it myself, or at least at another location.<//review>

<Text>Well. I bought a used care here. There were no issues with the car. But I decided to cancel my warranty after 7 months, that was sometime in Jun, 2017. Its 6 months since I requested the cancellation. I have'nt heard anything back despite frequent reminders. Clearly shows that they are there only to sell stuff to gullible people and once dont they just dont care..</Text>< pics>

Don't buy car service plan with these guys. I cancelled it in February still waiting for my money to come back. Also they didn't give car wash for the 2nd visit. The reason they told me is funny they are out of car wash coupons. Now I just finished calling 3 times for getting information on the service plan cancel refund. Very bad.</text>

I did write bad review previously. After that I reached out to the service manager name Mike  Rhodas  and explain the case. He took care of my issue and actually reversed the fee. My point is not money. My point is customer service which Mike Rhodas did it in best manner. Thank you Mike<//text>

I am a proud owner of a 2012 Hyundai Tucson which I bought a few months back from Stevens Creek Hyundai. I found it a very pleasant experience buying it from there with the help of the guys there - Abbey, Bill Ayers, Mac Sardari, Afif and all.... They were great to work with and I got the best deal possible! Needless to say, it was a really satisfying experience to buy a car from there and then having the guys make sure I don't forget my service dates (which I often forget)!  I would surely recommend the place for getting a nice car... :)

Happy buying and driving!!! :)</Text>

My experience with this location has been star-crossed from day 1 of leasing a brand new car here.  While the sales process was reasonably ok, the service dept just makes this place look bad.

1. The car got an Check Engine light on ** Day 3 ** while brand new !  The service dept gave me an appt of 1+ months to check on it.  I had to escalate to the regional office to get it looked at a different dealership -- Fremont Hyundai.  I got an appt there the next day !

2.  Situation 2 - schedule oil change / regular service.  The shuttle driver in what should be  a quick 2 mile drive to Barnes and Noble, takes 3 other passengers to much further destinations. I'm rushing to take a meeting at BN and the estimated 5 min drive becomes a 20 min tour of Steven Creeks neighborhoods to drop off some seniors first.

3. Situation 3 - Sonata died on middle of driving with a check HEV light.  Completely dead.  Car is towed to this dealership since it was the closest.  I had to do 10+ calls.  Finally get a guy to answer - he promises to call.  About an hour he does - Murphy's law has me missing the call due to a work meeting.  After 12 hrs (the next day - Sat), I finally get someone who tells me that they are not looking at the on Sat, and guess what - we'll call you on Monday.  Well, why didn't that guy say that on Friday ?

Long story short - Hyundai has a reasonably good product but this service dept is not doing the Hyundai brand any favors.

Last straw with this place....</text>

Ended up buying a damaged car and now am being forced to pay market price for it. These people will not listen and will NOT help. The general manager Mike Lopretta does not want to help. My credit got ruined because their mess up. I'm seeking legal action now. These are only a few reasons why you should take your business elsewhere.</review>

Just purchased a new car from Stevens Creek Hyundai…Absolutely Amazing Service!!!
I want to pay special recognition to the General Manager, Mike Lopretta, and the owner Mr. Isaac.

Keeping this review technical and less emotional, let me state my reasons for my 5 Star review…

My past experiences buying and leasing cars with other dealerships has been exhausting. With major work and health related commitments I did not have the physical energy, time, or mental capacity to continue shopping around with dealers that don’t care who you are and what your goal is this time around.

From the moment I connected with the Stevens Creek Hyundai Team I was treated with professionalism and respect. Before jumping into their inventory or financing options, Mike and his team actually wanted to know my car buying goals, budget, current and future expectations for the car. Mike Lopretta was more interested in seeing me find the right solution for my needs. After helping me find the right car, Mike personally fought to make sure my financing was perfectly in-line with my budget. Working with Mike and his team, you automatically get the owner of the dealership, Mr. Isaac, also fighting to get you the best possible solution for your needs. I was completely blown away by the unyielding support.

After finding the right car and Mike fighting to get the financing within my budget, I was impressed yet again by their high level of support. Mike had one of their technicians assigned as my personal Car Guru. Anything I need to know about the functions of my new car, I have someone that will help. Of course, I got a detailed overview of all the functions and amenities.

I live in Los Angeles, and they are delivering the car to me on Tuesday. I can’t say enough how blessed I feel getting my new car from Mike Lopretta and the Team at Stevens Creek Hyundai!

Mike, I said this before and I’ll say it again…God Bless You for everything you did for my family and I!!!

Visit 2013: I received a mail from Stevens Creek Hyundai - a scratch-to-win deal. And when I scratched, I won the vacation package. So to my excitement, I head over to the dealership. The lady at the desk made me fill up all personal information. And then she disappeared to the back to "get me my vacation package". She brought out something which also coincided with a car dealer approaching me. Since I was grateful, we go out for a drive on the Genesis. After I return, I visit the lady for my vacation package and she says they ran out of packages so she'll mail it to me. I wait a month. Nothing. So I call them. And they said they'll mail it out again. I wait another month. Nothing. At this point, I've lost credibility with them and don't feel like calling.

Visit 2012: I asked for a Santa Fe with all options applied (MSRP $36k). I had just come from a Ford dealer with a quote for Ford Edge SEL (MSRP $42k). The lease price was $200 higher for the Santa Fe per month for 36 months with all conditions equal. So I asked why. And this is where the sales rep started really being really sleazy. He talked trash about other car companies and how I was about to get scammed by Ford. He said Ford is dumping their cars on the market cause they aren't selling.< /Review>< time>

<Name>Gary Johnson<//Name><review>It is too bad that Hyundai is ruining a customer relationship within just a couple of months of it's nascent formation.  I purchased a 2016 Sonata Hybrid with about 10.5k miles on July 3rd.  Shortly thereafter I tried to activate the Bluelink system, but got an error message saying to call customer care.  I did that and after a few weeks of Hyundai trying to research and have me try various fixes, I was told to schedule an appointment with a Hyundai service department to have them take a look at some things.  I went to Stevens Creek Hyundai where the service department tried to fix things. The service manager I worked with was great!  They diagnosed things and told me I needed a new 'head unit'.  This had to be ordered, so after a day of not having my car, I had to wait until one came in.  That happened quickly and I left my car for a second time.  The head unit was replaced, but then I was told I'd need to bring it back for a 3rd time to get a new 'SD Card'.  Apparently the one that came with the car didn't work with the new 'head unit'.  Service manager called me back the next day though, and said that Hyundai refused to pay for a new SD Card ($180).  So, now I have a 'new' head unit, but the navigation system doesn't work and Apple Carplay doesn't work either; and, of course, the 'Bluelink' system still doesn't work.  I called customer "care" and was told, nope, sorry, the "resolution" we can offer is for you to pay the $180 for a new SD card; that or file a complaint with the BBB.  Called the service department and asked to have the old head unit installed that worked well enough with the old SD card, but no, it had already been shipped back to Hyundai.  So, trying to get Hyundai's "premier" Bluelink service to work so I could try it out has resulted in my car being damaged to the point that it doesn't work as well as it did before I tried doing what Hyundai's customer "care" told me to do.  I guess the old saying about, "You get what you pay for" is true.  Stay away from Hyundai!<//review><Resp>None<//Resp>< date>

After couple of searches i found Stevens Creek Hyundai is asking for 99.85 for 30k mile Factory Required maintenance service. I was surprised with the quote, so i called the dealer to confirm. The lady told me usually it is 400$. I mentioned that i see online 99.85. She called someone to confirm (i dont remember exact name but it could be Eric). That person asked me how did i navigate to the website. After getting all the details. He told they will respect the the price. The lady taken has given me appointment after two weeks and put a note there for 99.85. After two weeks, i drove from Foster City to San Jose and reached by 7 for 7:30 appointment. After providing the car for service, the Service Director (Mike) says it was an error and they cant provide service at that rate. The internet price is removed after that and asked for 229. I asked i should have been informed after the offer removal. Later he provided $50 discount but this is an awful experience. They should have respected their internet pricing. Unnecessarily i waited for two weeks and drove to San Jose in the early morning skipping office to save nothing. Very disappointing.

I bought my much awaited Elantra 2013 yesterday at Stevens Creek Hyundai. Overall buying experience was 5 out of 5. Dave, AJ, VJ and Ramin were outstanding. If you are going for Hyundai look no further :)< /review>

Are u going to take it or not?" Woaw. I am not a costumer hah? Actually I have got the car bc I was in rush. Not only manger also sale specialist L. I am asking for student discount. And I have said, can u pls give me a student discounts. He said that he used to be a student too. What an appropriate answer.

<Review>I bought an Elantra 2013 from Stevens Creek Hyundai. Michale Vu, my sales manager was excellent and went through all the options with me in detail. I entered the showroom at 6PM to look at the car and came back at 9 in my new car. In these three hours, Michael explained differences between various builds of Elantra, let me take a test drive, got me an excellent deal on the car, managed all the paperwork for me and further got me good finance and car insurance deals as well.</Review><resp>None</resp><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

About a year ago I was in the market for a Hyundai Veloster. I really liked the Veloster R-Spec and was very eager to buy, probably more than I should have been. I did a test drive which went well and returned the next weekend to discuss the deal. I had a corporate fleet deal and a vehicle I planned to sell before buying. The offered to give me a trade-in offer, I had low expectations on what that would be but figured I'd hear it our for fun. The offer was so bad it was borderline comical. I wasn't offended since this is fairly typical for a dealer so I said ok forget the trade in lets just see what we can do on the car. We go to look at the car again and now both drivers side wheels have been badly damaged. Someone driving it clearly hit a curb and hit it bad. I mention it and the rep literally walks up and rubs it like somehow the giant chip out of the wheel will go away. At this point I liked the car so much I thought ok fine lets get a little more off or swap some wheels we have a deal. The rep says no you are getting a fleet deal we don't need to sell you the car someone else will buy it as is. At that point I was done. I don't think its too much to expect to purchase and undamaged new car.<//Review>

<Review>I bought my car at this dealership. Here's my experience from 4 years of service.
1. Rude salesman
2. They crashed my car when I gave it for service
3. Slow/badly organized pick up-drop off service
4. Had to pay for uber every time I needed a ride

If I had a chance I'd rate it 0.5 stars.
Go there at your own risk!

<Review>I been there twice and both time I've shity experiences.  I will recommended  to nobody go there, too expansive and shity place with no experience. I went to regular  mechanic for less money just one shut and the problem is been gone for good. Stevens Creek Hyundai know how to count money in that case they should work at back or rename it huyndai bank.O yes if you want to spend money and west your time and case welcome.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

They advertise highly discounted new cars .When I asked about the low priced new car they have . I was told by sales person , that their advertising company made a mistake by double discounting the sales price  and next week they have the same add with a new date for the following month . Bait and switch .Buy outside bay area , prices are much higher here..</Review>

This is not a good service place. I echo the issues other have had in the past as I am having them right now. Appointments are far away with an average of one month delays. This is unacceptable since we can't drive around with an issue that might damage your car. From the capacity point of view, they have to fix this problem and expand the shop. The other problem is the girl answering the phones...a bad attitude with a poor customer sewevice experience. She should not be taking care of customers if she can't appreciate the concept of service. Not doing a good job representing Hyundai Steven Creek. Another issue is that nobody answers the phone and they don't call you back when you leave a message even though their greeting says that they will call you back. Another fata customer service flaw that I have seen repeated all the time when I camm for simple questions or just service. Seems that management there doesn't care about customers and I will call whoever is in charge of that place to let them know how bad of a job they are doing. Regarding buying or doig servoice there, I refuse to get another Hyundai and I will debate anybody who wants to sing the song that Hyundais are better. They are not, customer service being one of their lowest points. Or don't you remember the surpirse you got when you found out you didn;t have a spare tire?< /Review>

<Review>If you're nearby looking for a nice car for a reasonable price, just stop by and ask for Amir. Last weekend we purchased a Hyundai Genesis Coupe '13 at this place and Amir was the one who really helped us with testdrive, some hints and price negotiation. He and AJ worked hard to find the best available financing option and they succeeded. Even if you're looking not for a Hyundai, but just for a good and reliable car, give it a shot and try these guys!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fca8fbfba8ce1:0xa79bcdd52376478b</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have been waiting several months for the Turbo Veloster to come out. I filled out a form on the Hyundai website showing the car I wanted to build. I was contacted by Stevens Creek Hyundai ( Darren White) by email and informed that the car was in and that I could test drive it on a Monday night. I arrived on time and after waiting 15 minutes in the showroom was finally greeted by a loud mouth gum chewing rude manager. He informed me that neither Darren or Jim (the internet manager) were not in.
In fact, there was no Turbo Veloster there either! What a waste of time and incredibly
unprofessional. If you want proof, just hang out for a few minutes and you'll see.  Too bad Hyundai!< /Review>< date>

Guys....excellent service at the begining for the sale of the used car but DO NOT trust them at all..after sales service (and that too just in 20 days) was very very very BAD and not as per the reputation of hyundai...although i bought a used toyota camri from them, the car has started showing issue in 20 days only from the date of purchase....i still remember they said that in used cars also THEY DONT SELL JUNK, but guess this is their MOTTO to LIE and WIN trust of the innocent non knowledgeable car buyers...

ANYWAYS I GOT A ABOUT TO BCM A JUNK CAR, u guys DONT go to this dealer...as they GIVE assurance during purchase and BACK FIRE at the time of actual service.< /Text>

I started shopping for a car over the internet, my goal was to find a mid size family car, and Hyundai was by far the most affordable and attractive. I was contacted by multiple dealers, but choose Stevens Creek Hyundai because they sent me a quote for different cars upfront with end of the year incentives. I was contacted by Antonio  El Fouquani  their internet sales manager who was a great help for me at the dealership, their sales consultant David Gil was excellent at walking us trough all the specifics of the Sonata we choose, and A.J Hirani was excellent at negotiating  the financial terms with the bank. Overall I strongly recommend this dealer, and if you go there ask for Antonio  who was courteous and all the time there to help us and answer our questions.< /Review>

The worst part is on the final day they made me wait till 8:30PM and started forcing me to take car loan from them though i got a pre-approved loan.

I stopped by this place to test drive a Genesis Coupe. The sales guy was nice enough for the most part though he oddly didn't know how to drive a manual. The sales guy also had trouble giving directions since apparently he didn't have his glasses on and couldn't see where we were. I was not really impressed with the car so I tried to give a polite lack of interest after the test drive. To my complete astonishment the sales guy asked if he could run my credit report for financing. I was basically eliminating the car due to the steering feel and transmission, and here he wanted to run a credit check? He didn't even bother to ask how I was planning on paying which is important since I am going to pay with cash. Additionally, he was pretty heavy handed with the pressure to try and "run the numbers". Needless to say this place gave me the total sleeze-ball feel and even if the car had piqued my interest, I would not do business with them, ever.<//text>

I been on the market looking for a Genesis G70, I reached out to them in regards a vehicle they had, and 3 associates from managers and sales consultants didn't respond to any of my messages or emails in a lapse of 2 weeks, with that I'm very disappointed and will be doing business somewhere else, if you cant reach put to anyone in buying a car, imagine how they are in service,< /Text>

<review>This place is very bad.
I made an appointment 1 month in advance. I Rented a car and left my car and at the Stevens Creek Hyundai. They promised me that they call me during day, but they didn't check my car in next day too. They said they wouldn't be able to look at , until after the weekend. More lies.I took my car without any services in 3rd day. What is the point making an appointment if I have to wait for service for 3 days?
This is my first and last time here.</review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Thanks Stevens Creek Hyundai and especially ALEX an excellent seller, thanks for taking all the time to explain the options of buying the car and for not pressing as they do in other places. I definitely recommend 100% talk to the seller ALEX.
