< review>
I admire this restaurant! They serve excellent dishes, their menu is nice, The chief cook in that spot is an expert, I enjoy a lot tasting all their dishes. The food is consistently of high class, the attitude towards the guests  is very good too. I often eat in this place and I not even once was unsatisfied.  I highly recommend it.</review>

<Text>This pizza store sucks. This is thier better pizza. Charge for everything possible and this is what you get. You order take out because you are on a time crunch. Last time getting pizza from this location.<//Text>< pictures>

New menu is much easier to use.  Happy with the special parking spot pick up and employee placed order into vehicle with no problem.  Pizza and chicken was made fresh and was delicious.  Will order again this Sunday for SuperBowl.< /Review>

My hut if choice, the o lt hut in el monte. That's why. They deliver in good time and all drivers are friendly. The only draw back is the constant new people working the counter, they should try and keep some of them I little longer.<//Text>

Make sure your drivers have the complete order before leaving to deliver the food.  The driver came to drop off the food and did not have the 2 litter bottle of pepsi I had ordered.  By the time he got back,  our food was cold.  Not a good experience.  Also,  the pizza boxes where smashed,  causing the cheese to stick to the boxes.< /text>

The driver said the order was only two pizzas. The total didnt add up, how could have only ordered the pizza only  if the total was close to $40 bucks. 2 pizzas @ $8 with tax would only be like $25 tops.

You have better customer service I had a problem with an online order where it said no cheese and they said because of the mistake that the pizza would be free yet I waited 16 minutes and upon receiving the correct Pizza I was charged for it. Ridiculous!</text>

When I have my card and she said to stop by to get refunded over the phone and then they couldn't give me a void receipt talking about they can't reprint a receipt when I use to work in the fast food industry and know you just swipe the same card used and problem solved ..Pizza hut has unqualified people working for them as manager and should get a better manager that doesn't just say come tomorrow after 12pm Oscar the owner will be here like she s not the manager to solve the issues I would make her a cashier instead. No experience no wonder ppl complain they lie in this store in person and on the phone worst place to order i would take my business elsewhere<//text>< Pictures>

<username>Tavia Crigler</username><Rating>1< /Rating><text>My friend and I had been craving this specific pizza from your establishment for MONTHS. Finally after ensuring our safety and finding a time that fit both of our schedules, we had the opportunity to order so we did. To our dismay, especially with men the pizza was not good. It was the crust. With being a former General Manager for a place that specializes in pizza I instantly detected the issue within the first bite. The dough was old. Maybe the employees were attempting to use this particular dough through its full shelf life but I unfortunately had to pay the cost. BOTH ways. The dough was very much so rubbery and chewy which ultimately took away from the pizza as a whole. The unsatisfactory was so disappointing..not to mention this was my first and only meal of the day. My friend even mentioned ordering from Dominos instead. I insisted pizza hut. You all really dropped the ball with this one.< /text>< pics>

Delivery guy took forever got here and gave me attitude for having 100 bill. He was very indignant and rude and took my food questioning me about why I didn't use a card. I feel discriminated against due to my disability will never order here again the workers really need to learn how to talk to people. I really do feel that because I'm black he acted as if I was passing him a fake bill. Shame on all of you< /Text>

Ordered 2 pizzas online, Driver took a long time to deliver, when I finally received my order, one seal was broken with the pizza out of place like if it was dropped. The other pizza was cold and hard. Called Pizza Hut to let them know about the unsealed pizza (at this point I did not know about the cold pizza), they said they would send me a replacement. Once my kids opened the other pizza, they noticed it was cold and hard, called Pizza Hut again only to be told that they could send a replacement but it would take longer, I asked if I could just get a refund and forget about the whole order as it was getting late and my kids were hungry. I was told that in order for them to process a refund, I would have to be physically at the store. They can take your money but cant give it back to you without being there. Domino's it is next time....<//Review>

I eat in this restaurant often! This is my favorite spot to have a bite.  I go there at least once a month. The cooking is fantastic, the staff is friendly and the rates are fair. I like being in this restaurant to have a good supper.</Text>

The bread was crispy on outside and fluffy in the inside. I do think it had a little too much cheese. I got meatballs and they were so tender and delicious with the tomato sauce they come with. I saw the owner in there training new employees, one of which I know is an El Monte local. I have not dined in, but I saw they have a small arcade that seems fun.</Text>

Just ordered from these guys and this is what I get. Does anyone see anything missing... like the pepperoni and bacon i ordered. I literally got 1 pepperoni per slice and no traces of bacon. You people act like the ingredients are yours and your being stingy with them. I'm not ordering from you guys ever again. This is horrible< /Review>

<date>1570944708697</date><Text>I usually go to Papa John's and we always get 2 pizzas: 1 with no cheese and 1 easy on the cheese. Not everyone in my family can eat cheese. We did the same thing at this Pizza Hut and the pizza came out horrible. I requested extra sauce since I was leaving off the cheese so that the crust wouldn't be dry and get over cooked... but there were many spots of the no cheese pizza with no sauce and many of those areas were too hard to even eat. Never again. I'll just stick with our regular place I guess.<//Text>< rating>

Great place, always on point when it comes to giving what you order. The staff is capable and somewhat friendly, depends on how you treat them. Not to expensive and always willing g to help you out.</Review>

Went on-line to order 2 pizzas, chicken and pasta. Well when I called them they said only 2 pizzas at $7.00 ea total $25.00 that leaves tax and delivery charge $11.00 .... that is wrong but they said it was correct.</Text>

The negative 3 stars is for the management of this particular franchise who jacked up the prices here so much it's laughable compared to other Pizza Huts in the region. Any coupon you apply here is almost rejected online and in person; you're faced to pay full menu price practically all the time. Most of the nationwide deals you see advertised about Pizza Hut don't apply here either; as if this particular location went rogue or something. As of April 2016 they started taking *some* codes again which is nice, but still a lot don't work.

I would advise looking for Pizza somewhere else or go to another Pizza Hut if you don't mind the drive and must have them. Drivers and cashiers were always nice here though; shame I'll never interact with them again.</text>

<review>Piss poor service!! $29.00 (no tax?) For two large 1 topping pizzas. Barely spoke on the phone had to go back home for more money. This place is awful. No wonder why there's a Hiring sign in the window. Extra star because it was hot. I'm very fair on this.<//review>< Pics>

Kind of a tight/small yard but by far not the worst around. Was a bit chaotic during open hours. But weekends and after 1800 on weekdays it is a very easy in and out. Guard is always very friendly and their instructions are always concise and helpful. We did have a fuel tank busted on a reefer that was on this yard, but we cannot be certain it happened on site. All in all, the friendly staff and urgent manner of the workers makes up for the yard's crowded feel.</text>

Overall not bad. For OTR Carriers and Owner Operators, you drop your trailer and they load them overnight. They tell you that to check in at 0600 the following morning but trailers aren't usually ready until 0900. They allow bobtails to park overnight and keep in mind the portable bathroom looks like a CRST or CR England terminal (by the way, a lot of CRST and CR England trucks here regularly) other than the disgusting port-a-john, this place isn't all that bad. Food delivery options and a 7 Eleven up the street that you can bobtail to.< /review>

<text>Very rude.
They completely ignore drivers from other companies.
Very disrespectful.
This attitude is so pervasive that they actually ended up treating a customer who was there to pick up a package the same way they treat us.
"Oh sorry we thought you were a driver."
This place is a joke.
It starts with poor management that has no concept of customer service.
I got to meet one of the managers and asked him why they are so dismissive of outside drivers. He completely ignored the question and told me, "we will check you in when we have time".
Meanwhile several XPO drivers and the line-haul clerk are just standing around chit chatting while there's 5 drivers standing at the window.</text><user>114972346464647964841</user></record></dataset><record>

Was picking up a freight for my company. Directions were unclear where to go. Finally talked to someone and they tolde to wait outside by the window. I waited for 10 minutes, went back inside, and the witty banter continued for another 10 between the dispatcher and the drivers. I waited to be acknowledged and was told, my bad, I thought you were a driver...

I then waited another 15 minutes to get loaded because they didn't tell anyone that I was waiting. I'm giving 2 stars because the forklift operator did me a solid and asked me if I was waiting for something and checked it out. Thank God for him or else I would have been sitting there until the pandemic ended.<//review>

One of the rudest people I've ever had the pleasure speaking with at XPO logistics. Thank you for telling me my delivery was today, and then when I called XPO claims that nobody had called me to tell me the delivery was scheduled for today and "maybe" I would receive my delivery tomorrow if they "felt like it." I will make sure to share my experience about XPO with others and with so many choices available now days, will make sure to not use them in the future.< /review>

This company sucks. I’ve scheduled a delivery now multiple times. They don’t show up. You can’t ever reach anyone on the phone. They’re tracking feature doesn’t work. And this branch is by far the worst. Good luck trying to get anyone on the line.< /text>

Takes forever to get unloaded. My second time here, first time 24 hours for unloading now already 12 hours and they didn’t touch the trailer yet! This is not a good company! Stay away. I will cancel any loads in the future coming here!I hope those stupid warehouses can send their supervisors in training at Costco!Update:14 hours to get empty!< /Text>

Not always the best place.  Outside staff in the yard cab be kind if rude.  They say unit dock out when you're still waiting for the trailers.  Don't let them fool you. They did it to us. We got into trouble when we're finally reached Sacramento.  They said we lied about the time we left.  But i had proof i was still there at 1045. 1 and 3/4 hours later than they said we had left...</text>

During other hours a supervisor will help you, keep in mind they can be very busy. There is a period of 30 minutes when the employee is taking his lunch. If you're picking up an empty call ahead, as most companies will not be able to pick one up. Each loaded trailer gets loaded into once unloaded. The pick-up time the broker or driver manager give you is typically inaccurate, so ask the actual time and you will understand why you're waiting for 6+ hours.< /review>< rating>

Truck Entrance is on Shoemaker Ave.
Not a bad place just a little too busy. Security is dumb as always. Staff is new and still learning. No parking outside or on property. Only drop and hook< /Review>

I got a call the day before delivery to set up a time for delivery. The gentleman who delivered my merchandise was extremely nice. He was able to maneuver the truck into my street with no problem.<//Text>< Pictures>

Came half a day and early, they let us drop our empty trailer early, and park for the night.  Saved us from having to find a place to park, and rush hour traffic in the morning. Break room is nice. Lots of vending machines and microwaves.</text>

Crowded yard, hardly any place to put your trailer, the workers are pleasant but if you bring in a trailer to be loaded, make sure you can take a 10 hour break.</Review>

<Text>Nice experiences. This was over 3 weekly visits due to my issues with parts and making the car drive-able. They were consistently friendly. They clearly and accurately described the service ahead of time. They mounted and balanced 2 new tires I provided and did an alignment. They went beyond expectations rechecking one of the tire mounts discovering and replacing a bad gasket on a new sensor valve stem I provided. This at no additional charge. All this and their prices are the most reasonable I could find. I will be back when I need service in the future.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Car overheating no idea why .  DNA found that my water pump was the culprit . I was helped by two different guys. Said they would do a pressure test first .  They even let me watch my soap opera while  I waited .    Haha . They quoted me for exactly what I needed and got to work .  Marco mentioned I should look into some new tires  soon and gave me a quote . Fair price , I will defiantly come  back for new tires .  Over all my car was fixed in 4 hours .  No more over heating .  3 of my friends recommending DNA .  I’ve joined the club . If your car or truck needs  repair ,  maintenance ,   service inspection, or tires,  you’ll get honest  work from a great company .<//Text>

<Date>1620665112559</Date><userid>102773623845377288911</userid><review>We were fortunate to be around DNA Automotive and for Marco and his crew to be available on a Saturday afternoon.

The engine light of our Mini Cooper came on while we were driving out of SF (we drove from NY). Marco discovered that the Mini's spark plugs were stuck in the well, and pulling it out risked damaging the engine.

Marco ( akin to a doctor due to his Hippocratic approach to car repairs) was open and honest with providing us suggestions and options of how he would like for us to make repairs to his car (and letting us know of the pros and cons). In my experience, other shops will try to do the job without ever informing you of the consequences because they will mark up/upsell the job, but not Marco.

If you ever run into car trouble and happen to be around DNA, I highly suggest you seek our Marco and the good folks at DNA Automotive.

Two days later, Marco followed up with us to see how was the car. This is a stand-up guy.<//review><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

He is patient & understanding!
Will & the Auto Body crew are super accommodating!!
They all work well as a team to strive for quality customer service !  Thank you !!<//review>< Rate>

WHY DNA AUTOMOTIVE IS SO SPECTACULAR!
In 2017, I bought a 2003 Toyota Sienna and brought it to the team at DNA, which treated this old, somewhat forlorn beauty with vast knowledge, mixed with dashes of magic. Their restorative powers were dazzling. Never has an old car had such keen attention bestowed upon it. Over the last three years I brought it in for a few repairs and everything was always done so flawlessly. Just a day ago I took it in for an oil change and inspection and left not only with beautifully clean oil, but also with cleaned and adjusted rear brake shoes, plus an adjustment of the emergency brake, and the car suddenly feels like a spanking new one. It drives so gorgeously that I can't believe it's 17 years old, and that's because of the extraordinary abilities of these car repair magicians. They also took the time to adjust the rear seat belts at no charge that had become entangled. Speaking of charges, you will not find more reasonable rates anywhere, nor more convivial service. Donny, Antonio, and Marco are three of the most impressive and terrific fellows one could meet. Get your car to DNA! You'll be thrilled with the outcome.</Text>

I brought my car for a full 150K service and that is exactly what I got, no more no less!!  These guys are awesome, they never try to oversell you stuff that you don't need.  They are very thorough with everything and pay attention to detail.  I would definitely recommend DNA to anybody looking for high quality service, friendly personnel, and affordable prices!!<//text>

Great experience. Worked with Antonio.  Prompt return of calls and highly professional interaction.  Took the time to walk me through the process of tire selection with good suggestions and explained various cost for warranty service work.  Good pricing that is competitive with everyone.  Couldn't ask for more.< /review>

But I had come in the week prior and no offer for warranty repair. Curious and asking around about the tune up cost I learned that this shop charged very high.. this is my experience and it has not been positive with this shop.  It looks as though others have had much better results.  I do not  know if their work on my car caused future problems but will now have to pay again to have what I believe should have been a good business decision on their part to at least repair or commit to repairing while reducing the cost of what I am now having to face for what may be related to the work that was done just one year ago.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80859a196db13237:0x1788b3ca0942d409<//gmap_id>< Time>

A second time I came in for an oil change, they found that a brake sensor cable was grazing against the tire, something the dealer missed and could have affected my ability to stop the car.

I have been going back to them many times and saved time and gotten better service than the dealership.

<text>Yet another outstanding experience at DNA Automotive.  We now take all three of our cars there for service and body work.  They continue to be thorough, responsible, trustworthy and provide excellent results at a great value.  They go out of their way to ensure everything is explained in detail, and never, ever encourage work if not required for safety or long term benefit to the vehicle.  They are courteous, and their shop and waiting area is always clean.  I continue to be both impressed and grateful to have found them, and would recommend them for any vehicle - old or new.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I made an appointment to get my throwout bearing replaced on my 2017 mustang gt just 4 days before and they were really helpful and they had my car done the same day had my clutch upgraded to a stage 3 they did a better job than the dealer. The first time I had this problem the dealer had my car for almost 2 weeks before they worked on my car and they broke the covers around my shifter and left car grease all over the interior. DNA took really good care of me, their really clean highly recommended.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Antonio and Donny are always friendly, always smiling and treating their customers very well, they are also professionals, and honest.

This week for example I took my car to change the oil, and they said I didn't have to, but I had to check the break, so they did what they had to do, other mechanics will change the oil without necessity, plus will fix the break just to get more money, and DNA was totally honest with me just doing what they had to do so far, this honesty and professional ethic I will always value this.

I highly recommend this place!!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The guys at DNA delivered again! Both Antonio and Donny are very knowledgeable and make major problems seem easy. I trust them completely to provide a fair estimate and to get the work done on time, for the price that was estimated. I have brought my car over for mechanical repairs quite a few times and I have never had a problem with their service. I constantly refer friends because I trust them fully. I also heard DNA now provides body work too. I hope I won't need it, but I'd certainly recommend people to get an estimate there. Anyways, I'm very happy with DNA and I will definitely continue bringing my car and my motorcycle over.< /Review>

DNA Automotive was able to get me in right away on Saturday with short notice. They identified some other work that needed to be done: a headlight bulb had gone out that I didn't notice, and the oil and filter needed to be changed. Marco and Antonio were both thorough and very easy to work with.

They did identify additional work that would need to be done over the next few months, but they were not aggressive in pushing me to get it done now. They also explained the implications of delaying doing the work so that I could make a choice of what to do now and what to do when I had more time.

DNA's prices are very reasonable. The additional work was quoted at a very competitive price. I had called around for other estimates and DNA's estimate for the original work was less than the others. The final price held to their estimate. No surprises. They kept me informed about the progress, and completion was very close to what they estimated.

I highly recommend you check them out if you need work repair work done on your car.

15 October: Just went back for a second service and am pleased to doubly confirm my previous review :)!<//text>< user>

The guys at DNA are fantastic. I found them refreshingly honest, and above and beyond helpful. Donny showed me how to change my air filters, check my fluids, and gave me recommendations for quality tires and a quality battery when I'm ready to trade my old stuff out. He helped me prioritize maintenance on my car - what needs to be done now vs. what I should do soon. I'll definitely be back the next time I need car repairs and/or maintenance!< /Text>

I first came in to check up on my Check engine light and before they used a single tool they suspected my breaks were the main issue.

Their staff is very knowledgeable with cars of all kinds and they also do body paint which while an expensive feature is something some are looking for.

They are a great place to check out if you want to have a team of regulars looking at your car.< /Review>

I was greeted amiably by Donny and Antonio, the two owners.   The car had sustained front end damage while parked which  crumpled up the left front.

Their Operations Manager, Will Banuelos,  took care of the whole process, the crazy insurance issues and the estimate.  He directed the technicians.  He arranged for a rental car and transportation to the rental office.  They started work on the car immediately.  I depend totally on this little car and was concerned for how long this might take.  Within a couple of days, Will called to say that the car was ready.  It looks like a new car!!!  I noticed they had even cleaned the interior to leave it customer-ready.

This business takes pride in their customer service -- and with good reason. Fast, clean and professional.  Contact Will Banuelos .  With his 38  years of experience in the field, you can stop worrying.  You and your vehicle are in good hands.!!!!<//text>< UserId.>

<username>Timothy Dempsey< /username><text>So this morning I had to go to Napa Auto Supply next door to get a new battery (replacing my previous Napa battery that died well before it should have) and they were really unhelpful. They had me turn off my car to test the battery - they found it dead (which was pretty obvious from the fact that my car wouldn't start without a jump) and then said "your battery is dead and we can't jump you". Umm, okay .. thanks a lot Napa. So they then told me I had to install the replacement battery myself - I have no tools - they kindly offered to sell me tools - how nice of them. I walked next door to DNA and explained this to the manager and he was like "no problem, we'll help you out" and they sent Domingo out with tools and a device that even kept the radio in power when they took the battery out. They did all of this entirely free of charge. I am not at all surprised to see that this is a 5 star shop - I just found my new mechanics (even though I like my current mechanic). Thank you DNA!< /text><user>108684330430504737669<//user><GmapID>0x80859a196db13237:0x1788b3ca0942d409</GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1538253095713, 'text': 'Always happy to help any time you need us, Timothy!

<review>A very small place for you to make your order, allowing only one person to be in there. That forces you to make your order very quick to exit and allow others to go in after you. For me, it's an advantage and disadvantage in the same time.
No time for me to evaluate the friendliness of the staff.
Clean place.
A big parking lot in front of it, directly on Beach Blvd.
Value for money: 2/5 pizza size is not that big.
Taste/quality (my point of view): 3/5.

I recommend trying other small pizza shops, pizzarias, you might get the same quality, or even beteer, for better prices.<//review>< Pictures>

I ordered 1 deep dish pepperoni pizza with toppings of bell pepper, onion, hot sauce added along with a 8 piece boneless wings. The driver delivered both items when I opened the pizza it had everything but the hot sauce. I check the receipt and hot sauce was a topping I was charged for. I called the store a woman answered and I told her the situation. She tells the manager and they say they'll send me another pizza but I have to give the first one back which is fine only a few bites out of the one piece was missing. I then asked to get new order of wings so everything would be freshly hot and I'll give you guys the first wings back as well. The manager gets on the phone says no there only mistake was that they didn't give me hot sauce on the pizza that I was charged for. I said that I would like all my food to be freshly hot and eat them together because I would have to wait another hour for the second pizza and the wings will get cold. He said there's nothing he can do if I don't like it I can call the 1-800-dominos number and complain. The manager said his name was Samuel, he was very rude and kept cutting me off when I was talking to him. This store has the worst customer service I've ever had just look at all the other customers reviews that people are leaving... My company and I will never order from them again!< /text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Went from oven to my mouth in about 20 min or so...Good job. Only bad thing which got it 3 stars is cost. Order a 20$ with coupon. Including tip end up costing 30$ that's a big jump for a 20$ pizza. As good as pizza is and quick service I probably won't be ordering pizza again. I'll be satisfied with store bought deserno. 50% cheaper<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I placed an order online I also checked the Box that asked me if I wanted to have a text sent 2  minutes before they arrived since they only deliver contactless deliveries meaning they leave it at the front door so I waited and waited Pizza never came I finally called them and asked to speak to manager the manager said that they delivered it and I said well I've been here the whole time and nothing was delivered funny I also have a front door camera and there was nobody that ever dropped any food off in front of the door and I told him I didn't receive a text and he said well then you must have given us the wrong phone number and I said what address do you have the address was correct . He told me that it was not his problem and to call my bank to reverse the charges.Never offered to remake pizza etc. Terrible customer service. . i do not recommend this location for pre paid deliveries.THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! THEY ARE RUDE AND THIS STORE NEEDS TO FIRE ALL OF THERE EMPLOYEES. GET A WHOLE NEW STAFF IN THERE.< /Text>

<text>Food is great. One of the staff members named Marco cut me off while I was talking and practically yelled in my face for absolutely no reason. It came out of no where.

Horrible customer service by Marco.

What's the point in curbside pickup if they don't actually use it?? Not even a simple "my apologies" at least?? Avoid this dominos if you can.<//text>< pics>

<Text>My family tried to order using their online service since there was a deal and decided to change our order from one pizza to two instead. We put the orders under different names so and specified which order we wanted to cancel. When my grandpa arrived to pick up the pizza we were told that both orders were cancelled. I called them and they said that apparently if you cancel any online order you can’t make anymore online orders for the rest of the day so our two pizza order was cancelled too. So I asked them if I could just place the same order through the phone and if they could ring it up for the online deal and they said there was no way they could do that and that there was nothing they could do about the online service cancelling the order we wanted. They were not very understanding of the situation or patient enough to explain all of this to my grandpa and they were not accommodating at all.< /Text>< UserId.>

Called in a pizza order at 5:15 PM and they said it would be ready in 20 to 25 minutes. When I arrived 20 minutes later, they said they hadn't started the order and it would take 20 to 25 minutes. I cancelled the order and left. 45 minutes from the time I called in the order is too long.</text>

<Review>This a maximum security Domino's. They won't release your food without 3 forms of ID, a urine sample and a DNA test. But really - It's just bread and cheese, no need to have it on lockdown. I even showed my order on the app. I Was really shocked, I never had this happen in another Domino's, because you know, it's DOMINO'S. I guess it makes the employees feel important or something, whatever.< /Review><user_id>102759521921120022488< /user_id></record>

<text>Usually really good but this last time I ordered the thin crust & it was stuck to the pizza box seemed like maybe not cooked enough because it was still soft in the middle maybe the thin crust was so old it got stuck to the pizza it was difficult to grab the middle of it off the pizza box or maybe the so much cheese they put instead of the extra philly we asked for made it get stuck in the middle and still remain soft ..< /text><user_name>Maritza Desire</user_name>< userid>

Saw the TV ads and I called for a large 3-Topping Thin Crust, as I thought it was advertised for $7.99. They sold me a "medium" 3 topping for $11.81, out the door.
I thought I may have misunderstood the ad, but I saw it again today. They sold me a medium, instead of a large, so they could charge me more. :-(
I do NOT recommend this store on Slater and Beach.<//review>

!!!!DO NOT GIVE YOUR BUSINESS TO THIS LOCATION!!!!
I wouldn't even give 1 star. The whole experience was very poor.

Upon carry out pick up an employee refused to provide my two pizzas because they require an ID. No where online does it state an ID will be required upon pick up. This is my second time ordering from here the first time I was not asked for one.

I spoke to the store manager Jose, employee ID#718784 who was extremely rude from the beginning of the call, did not provide alternative options and immediately stated he would cancel my account. I recorder the conversation because the owner needs to know the character he has managing this location. I informed him I was recording him and he went on being disrespectful calling names. I can only imagine how he might treat employees. Not a way management should be treating customers, not for a $20 transaction.

Before leaving the store we tried providing a photo ID and he again, refused to accept it waving arms in the air. PLEASE REVIEW CAMERAS FOR THIS (7/5 around 5:10pm). Due to this behavior I am taking this to corporate, franchise management and the BBB.

I understand if it's a requirement; however, there is a professional way to approach a situation and the way it was handled was just unacceptable.

It's been 45 minutes and I have yet to receive an email confirming the cancellation.</Review>

Placed an order and then recieved a call that they closed for pickup and the cutoff was at 11 when order was going through at 1059. Also, no statement on website or notification from app that they closed at 11 for pickup. Just lazy and dont want the business. Why work?<//Review>

<Review>Best Pizza 🍕pie & tapas I’ve ever eaten, my Mother’s ever eaten (and she is a hard critic!) and my Big Brother’s favorite too!!! In our house, there’s one thing I remember and love the most! And that was Dominos Pizza 🍕 every Friday night no matter what, growing up, my Mama always ordered Dominos pizza 🍕!!! I love that it’s always one of the same couple different delivery drivers who know my dog and love him! Duy is my absolute favorite!!!I love that it’s always here in less then 20 minutes and that’s at the very most. Usually I get it within 15 minutes of my online order. I also always order online! It’s great! They keep making it better & better adding more features and making it easier to completely custom make an entire order online in less then just a few minutes! I am lucky & grateful that my Mama taught me well! And I’m lucky & grateful to have a really great neighborhood Dominos!!!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Terrible customer service!!!
After a 10-hour day of work I was starving.
My wife did not have dinner, but offered to order one from Domino's down the street.
I went to go pick up pizza and they would not release to me because order was placed under my wife's name and credit card.
I suggested the store to call her and verify information, even pointed out that the last names were the same.
I left that store went home and ordered a pizza from Domino's 2 blocks down the street.
Had no issues there.
I would avoid the Domino's on Beach and Slater between 9 and 10 p.m.
Rude unhelpful customer!!<//review>

<text>Not so good to start - ordered two pizza's online and its been over an hour with no pizza yet!! Talked to a "manager" Supposedly said he tried to call and say they were really busy but was told I included the wrong phone number, which is incorrect because the delivery guy just called and said he was lost!?!?!? Its literally right across the street and everyone has google maps. The Pizza once it did arrive was great - I understand things get busy.</text>< pictures>

<review>The mix of the smells,garlic,tomatoes,cheese, fresh handmade breading(sushi bar style, made right in front of you by many of the smiling faces that work there) baking together inspired me to start drawing on the chalkboard. It had a sign that read "daily special".but in the box there was nothing but the memoirs of 5-8 year olds expressing their artistic influences in the way of unorganized scribbles and happy faces. The sign for daily special was highly unnecessary as the cooks at this Domino's somehow found the secret of making great pizza, and are now exploiting it like Disney is doing to Star Wars.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>The medium handmade pan pizza, even redeemed as 1 of the 2 items for $5.99 coupon applied, and factoring in the additional $2 premium upgrade, somehow prices out to $10.99 after changing delivery address when the exact same pizza in a different city was previously $8.49 on the last page. I assume it is made out of the same amount of the same ingredients. So how does a 12 mile difference necessitate a $2.50 price hike?

Also the pizza was more bland than usual.<//Text><rate>2<//rate></record></dataset><record>

One time my phone or the app somehow changed my order from 2 pizzas to 12, I didn't realize it until my bank called about the charge, I cled Domino's, unsure if it was my mistake or an app glitch and even though they already made the pizzas, they reveresed the charge and brought me the 2 I intended to order. They could've been frustrated or tried to charge me, but instead they understood things happen.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I've reviewed them before and given them a 5 star because they've always been great through the app, but this time I placed an order over the phone.  The order took way too long, that I had to cancel because it was late!  Their customer service is not that great!  I guess that's why they developed an app because they can't get good people to work their front lines.  I order here all the time, I guess I have to start looking elsewhere for food delivery.<//text>

I just want to thank the team at the Beach Boulevard store that  prepared , cooked and delivered my order my online order, to Victoria for making sure my wings were extra very very well done, they were perfect, to Michael for making my pizza it was very good and to Thomas who delivered my order great job nice guy great smile , very polite ! You guys all did a terrific job I was pleasantly surprised and very much satisfied, thank you! And I recommend this paticular store to anybody and everybody for overall great service! Not sure who the manager is at this store but the team you put together on tonight's schedule was the best combination of crew that you've had there in awhile , put more teams like that together and you'll have a number one store , with reason to be proud in no time !<//review>

This location often has trouble cooking the hand tossed pizza thoroughly and they are over the top suspicious when you use a credit card through the app. They demand the credit card and ID to pick up your order. They once tried to refuse to release my pizza even though it was only $2 charged on a card.< /text>

Very unprofessional staff:-(
My wife ordered a large pizza to carry out. When went inside the young guy ask the name on the order. I told and spelled out the name but he jump ahead typed something I did not say. He could not understand a simple cellphone number. I have to yell the number to him. Keep away from this location. Very very unprofessional staff. I am a Dominos Pizza fan but while in Huntington Beach CA, I would spend my money somewhere else. BAD is the only word to describes this location in one word.< /text>

Pretty horrible experience over the phone. The person just picked up the phone and screamed “DOMINOS!” and didn’t even try to listen to what I was saying. He said delivery orders will take an hour, even though I wanted carry out. He put me on hold for over 10 minutes so I just hung up. Not recommended.<//Review>

I ordered, as I have done before, last Sunday in fact! And the deliveryman REFUSED to leave my order. When I called there Samuel the manager refused to respond to my request that my food be re-delivered fresh and hot. Made up an excuse about corporate policy, that’s not listed ANYWHERE!!! So I’ve posted a complaint to Ann Arbor Corporate headquarters. I will continue taking my complaint until the CEO is made fully aware of this issue and revoked the license of this poor excuse for a fast food restaurant.<//Text>

<text>So I talked to hose or jose because I dont think he wanted to give me his name. I called at 11 and he told me I wasnt in his delivery range. Called the 1 800 dominos number and was referred to this store again. Called again and was told again he didnt deliver to my area so that guy was lying.  Honestly these guys should get better employees because I have ordered to my house from this location before.   Alex had always been awesome but this guy was useless</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The customer service at this location is the worst! They delivered a pizza that was missing slices.  When I reached out to manager, I was told to call the 800# and file a complaint. Seriously! This really happened. Stay far away from this location.  One of two things needs to happen. The franchise owner needs to fire every single employee that worked tonight. OR Domino's needs to sever ties with this store and not continue to be humiliated by a store that is as low performing as this.</Text>

Out of all the franchise pizza spots, dominos is the most reliable.  I've travelled the country for work, and dominos is one of those restaurants that will always deliver to just about any hotel in the country.  This location is just as reliable, and one of the quickest to deliver as well.

Food is always hot, and they don't skimp on the garlic.  I always tip well because they always deliver quality.</review>

The pizza is always excellent and to our liking.  Delivery is prompt and the drivers are courteous.  We order frequently, but will only order from this store.  Thank you for your service.</review>

<Review>Placed an online order and I called immediately Afterward to let them know I wanted pineapple on the side instead of cooking it in the pizza,  but they wouldn't accommodate what I wanted which was pretty simple. I told them that I was going to go through a different place if they couldn't do that,  but they didn't care.  Bad customer service.  How hard is it to put pineapple on the side?  especially since They didn't start making it yet. They were very rude about it. Definitely never going to order from this store.< /Review>< Pictures>

<UserId.>118176006683564905784< /UserId.><Text>I ordered half pepperoni and half extravaganza, and repeated order to employee. They read it over to me before sending, then end up sending entire pizza as extravaganza. My daughter isn't happy, as that was her half.  Manager will not send pepperoni because we started in on pizza they sent and we waited 45 min for. She was going to, then called back and asked if we had started eating. Time passed, we were hungry, she didn't say to not eat our half of an extravaganza large.  So she says no dice on rectifying HER mistake. Not happy with her decision to not just send pepperoni when it was their fault in the beginning.<//Text>< name>

Good pizza, but not great (a bit doughy, IMHO). Might be better to request either the Brooklyn style, or from a locally proven pizzeria.</Text>

I would recommend staying away from this location until they lose Jose as their manager. Very rude condescending and doesn't take any responsibility for mistakes. Trust when I say if your order is wrong he won't do anything to fix it. Sad I used to order all the time until being treated with such disrespect. Fire Jose and I might order again. until then, you won't get anymore of my money.</Text>

We recently moved to the area and we noticed the first and second time we ordered, both our pizzas hardly had any toppings. The third time we decided to try the gluten free crust and it was burnt. Three Strikes guys! 😞<//Text>

Doesn't even deserved one start. First one they delivered was burned and dry. Called they said they will deliver another one in 45 minutes... waited for 45 minutes and you would think for their second chance they'll try a bit harder... nope, all they did was dumped loads of sauce and forgot about the other toppings.  So disappointing.  Never again<//review>

Worst service, worst organizational skills,hanging up on customer's, can't use phone system, unable to get  customers on hold....Sergio oviously m.i.a. every one is looking for him, same as last time.  Westminster store so much more  professional and courteous, & efficient.
You guys Need help, professional and mental.  Seriously. ...not to mention the nightmare of online ordering.  Ahhhhh Ridiculous</review>

Been waiting to pick up my call for last 27 mintues.....obviously the manager doesn't know how to staff his people or even figure out how to handle the traffic......but again it's probably managed by some mid level manager making 15 bucks an hour...can't expect much.< /text>

Was very very bad service.  Computer tracking was a lie.  Pizza didn't arrive for a good 15 min. AFTER the online tracker said it had been delivered.  Called the store and the person I spoke with claimed to be the manager.  He had a bad attitude.  Pizza was also COLD!.  Did I have a bad attitude?  HECK yah!  Wouldn't you if you had the wrong online info. and pizza was delivered very late AND cold?  That ends my business with Domino's.  Sticking with Lamppost only from now on.</Text>

Very rude Manager I believe his name is Jose, I called to mention I received bone in and I ordered bone out wings. He sounded frustraded and would let me finish or talk. I had a new order coming so he said I will cancell your order, I said no I want my pizza I just want to make sure this time I get bone out, he said order is cancelled and hung up. I called again he said order is cancelled call 1800 dominos number if you want to complain then hung up again : ( Very sad to see how Dominos is being miss represented by namagers like Jose. I will never order Dominos agian and will make sure to tell everyone I know. It was so frustrating!!</review>

They never bring what you pay for (any extras) and refuse to refund, waiting for corporate to get involved like many other reviewers<//Text>

Ordered pizza from Domino’s paid online and ordered online did not know I had to bring the card and my ID with me to pick up the pizza so I had to go all the way back home to get my ID now or food is cold and I’m pissed off they did not tell me to bring my ID no point in paying online if you have to give the card and your ID and sign for it what’s the point of paying online</Text>

My 6yo found a bat in our backyard. It was acting strangely & we brought it in. As the day went on, I started to become concerned about it's behavior. I called & spoke to Sincere. She refused to give me any information about the animal. I became more & more agitated by her lack of helpful information on the sick animal or what steps we could even take to make sure my 6yo & pets would be safe as rabies is a real concern. I was worried about my child & upset. She was hostile & sarcastic. Eventually she relented & supposedly asked a supervisor. I was told to call Animal Control. This turned out to be misleading information. Animal Control was shocked they & informed me they should have instructed me to contact Public Health. After speaking with the right people, I called back to let VCA know, as I believed she made an honest mistake. I spoke with Jennifer this time. She was curt & completely blew me off. I'm blown away by the sheer lack of consideration & tact one expects from a professional in a position to care for others & their pets.</Review>

We had to put our dog Selma down today. They were there for us when our local veterinarians wouldn't make the time. Drove an hour to get there. My husband said they were compassionate and friendly. Highly recommend! Worth the trip. Thank you for making her final moments peaceful.

Staff is always very friendly and helpful! Very kind & gentle with my pets. They take time to do everything they can to take care of any problems my pets have had. Used to avoid going here because of hearing their prices were really expensive....but have found the costs of their services similar to other vets I’ve used! Decided I really love these vets and their staff! Highly recommended!!< /text>

I was wise and took my dog to Lancaster and got fantastic service, great same day service and True concern over my dogs health issue.
Poor service, poor turn around and not worth staying in town to get help.

Took my dog to get vaccinated and it took less than 10 minutes for the entire process. They even called following up to make sure my dog tolerated the vaccines. Staff was very friendly and approachable.  Will take my dog here again in the future.</text>

< Review>
Charges way too much and give poor quality care.  They charged me $550 to tell me my cat had ring worm on his leg, which it what had said I thought he had when I brought him in. They told my friend his cat had sprained his leg and it would get better in a couple of weeks. Fast forward 2 weeks the cats leg had swelled to over twice the size. The cat had an abscess not a sprained leg. They misdiagnosed this poor cat and almost killed him.< /Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>Good hospital that takes care of routine needs. The only issue is if you have an emergency, they will not fit it in.

In the 2 years I have lived here my dog has had 2 emergencies. Once as a puppy her shoulder was broken by another dog. They would not fit me in and were closed the day it happened. Had to wait a week to see them and had to drive 1.5-3 hours to see a vet TWICE for the shoulder.

If your dog has a life or death emergency they probably wont live if they won't fit it in and you have to drive.<//Text>< pics>

<pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>107566055902119743027<//UserId.><Text>We were very disappointed with the front office staff today. We had a scheduled appointment for vaccination for our kitten. We showed up on time to a VERY overcrowded lobby. There are boards with pet names indicating which side of the waiting room should be utilized (big dogs vs. tiny kittens). When we expressed concern about the amount of dogs spread out across the entire waiting area and asked what we should do, they replied “oh, you have a cat”!? 😒 They basically suggested we could hide in the corner but that they were super busy. So on top of not managing the front so that the animals were more comfortable and separated appropriately, and overbooking appointments to the point that the animals were everywhere, we also had to wait for an unreasonable amount of time past our scheduled appointment time with an anxious and unnecessarily scared kitten. Then to top it off, we were charged more for a vaccination that we just received 3 weeks ago. I understand prices go up, but you would think that if prices go up they should advise the customers of this prior to the service.< /Text><Date>1571426496628< /Date>< gmap_id>

We finally heard of a gifted Veterinarian who comes from out of town with their competent and caring staff once a week and charges almost HALF as much as Crestwood. I can bring in more of my animals, and have them treated like the kings and queens they are at my home, with much more patience and compassion, at nearly half the cost. Crestwood, stop ripping off our community!<//text><gmapID>0x80c112e0f096b96d:0xa1654ec60c5c1997< /gmapID><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pics>

I took my neibor, there because her dog Lucky, got attacked by another human and his dog in the alley behind my home. I waited for her in my truck and gave her a ride home. Seems like a nice place.</Text>

They did a fantastic job this trip. The staff is curtious, even effervescent & professional. I had an 8 year old rescue neutered and expected him to be very very sick for several days due to his advanced age. But they gave him liquid Meloxicam for pain. Wonderful med, I couldn't tell anything had been done. I even had to work to keep him calm.</Text>

<username>Keith Heflin< /username><Text>Caring but unprofessional or at least untrained staff. They took 5 days to respond to a prescription refill request so I had to purchase meds from Crestwood for the gap.  No accountability, totally their fault, but they still charged the dispensing fee. Cost was more than ten times the online price. I recommend Allivet, just make sure you give Crestwood a couple of weeks to screw around.<//Text><user>116377242130010175724</user></record>

They get busy because they are a great place.
I really love how the vets explain what is going on with my older pets so I can understand and make informed decisions. They give me options and are up front about the cost of treatment.
They work with the local Humane Society to provide low cost spaying and neutering for cats and dogs.
A rattle snake aversion workshop is offered in the spring.<//Review>< GmapID>

Dr. Decker and Christine (VA) were so kind and caring yesterday when I brought my dog in. After a horrible experience a year and a half ago, I swore I would never step foot in there again. Yesterday completely changed my opinion. My poor dog had become quite ill  and we were fearing she caught something or ate something bad. Sadly, it was very aggressive cancer and we had to say goodbye. The people were so kind and gentle. Thank you for taking such great care of my baby. Thank you for giving me the extra time I needed to say goodbye in the exam room, despite being very busy. Thank you for everything!</Review>

I received a $400 Bill and a misdiagnosis that nearly cost my dog her life.i had to go to L.A. (2 hrs away) for emergency surgery. I would give them no stars but one of the vets there directed me to the place that saved my dogs life. They wouldn't do it themselves because i because i did not have another $900 to give them. Very unprofessional and careless of the vet andcareless of the hospital too have such a careless vet attending! I will NEVER go to VCA again.< /Text>

Thank you Brianna (Hope I spelled that right)! Very helpful in getting my very sick done in to see a Dr. And it wasn't even at her office. She called another vet and got me in to see them. Great job!<//review>

Very overpriced.. They want $ before the services are done to your animal. After hundreds of dollars,they didn't even set my animals leg correctly.  On their phone recording,it gave shot clinic hours for SAT,and they told me they don't have it on SAT,so I paid full price for that on top of other charges.The office staff and female vet are nice.</Text>

Our dog cut her paw and we were told they could get her in, in two weeks.  Seriously?  And we were told sternly “no walk ins”. We get it you are the only game in town, but seriously?  I will drive from now on to get my pets needs taken care of.  This type of attitude is why people don’t stay local.</text>

<review>I just moved here a couple days ago and my dog ate one of my medications.  I have had little sleep and feel very lost and I am not settled in yet.  I was very worried and needed help.  I called and when I said I did not want to make an appointment, I just need some guidance, I was told they could not help me unless I came in and paid.  When I said I could have googled the information instead of helping me feel calm and offering to help my pet the person that answered the phone HUNG UP ON ME!!!  I understand they don't want liabilty for giving medical advise over the phone but when you are talking to a CUSTOMER and they are upset because their pets life is at risk, you can treat them with respect. I will drive hours before I will use this vet.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>recently took my dog into crestwood animal hospital to have her teeth cleaned and if a cavity was found remove the tooth.  The vet Dr, H called
to tell me other teeth were loose.  Nail clipping was to be included.
Only half of the tooth cleaning was done at the time he called. I instructed Dr. H to finish the cleaning  and call again so I could decide what work would be
done.  He called again in a few minutes and told me the job was done and he had removed 1 tooth and that no cavity had been found.  The nail clipping was also not performed.  A staff member told me they have had  previoulys had problems with Dr. H.  Crestwood has failed me and my pet
and do not believe this Dr, H should be alloowed to continue work here.< /Text><userid>116710586368610556784</userid><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

After witnessing a baby rabbit being nearly mauled by a bird we were able to rescue it and call the wildlife rescue who directed us to this Vet. They were more than happy to take the injured rabbit! If I lived here I would totally trust these Vets!<//text>

<user_name>Jake Molenkamp</user_name><Text>Went because our golden retrievers face swelled up and his jaw locked shut, along with some other symptoms. They gave us the equivalent of doggy ibuprofen and a 180 dollar bill, it was going to be almost 400 but i refused some of their ridiculous priced things. They told us to come back in a couple of days. After a 10 minute google search we found what was wrong and his symptoms matched to a T. Something the vet there didn't even consider, infact ignored his jaw all together. I do have to give credit to the staff who was exceptionally nice and helped me sort through some of the unnecessary charges. Just upset that our dog was misdiagnosed and for an outragous price.< /Text>< userid>

After the second week we took her to Bishop Vet in Ridgecrest and they tell us its congestive heart failure, which sounded more accurate. after 2 days of being on CHF medicine Josie is now feeling much better and hasnt wheezed since.  Crestwood took my grandmother for $420 dollars for a wrong diagnosis, and really $420 dollars for a vet visit is just plain ridiculous. This business is obviously money hungry and cant diagnose properly either.< /review>< Response>

<review>This place treats your pet better than your loved one's are treated at a people hospital. They care about you and the entire staff greet you with smiles and questions, no matter thier job position.

The office staff at the desk are so smiling and helpful to the point of shock and happy surprise, the entire staff goes out of their way to give you the comfort you need, to do what is the absolute best for your dear pet and they actually love your animal. Love is one thing you can't fake and it shows in thier every action and kind word. They help rescue organizations in and around the area and know best which one's are worthy of your time, your support and funds, and any rescues you are blessed with finding. The vet my Mr.George F. Dirt. was treated by was, was Dr. Katherine Gerow DVM and she was beyond knowledgeable about every single thing that she was asked by me, plus super lively and actually happy to see us. I do rescues, and have done by the hundreds, on the East coast, and to say I'm vastly experienced with all types of animals and most definitely all types of those affiliated with thier care and well being, would be quite a safe statement.

These people, as a whole, are overflowing with love, concern, and care for you and your pet. I'm so happy to be able to leave this review. Animals deserve humans like this for a change.💕</review>< pictures>

The Evergreen drinks are so good that me and girlfriend will always come back for more! By the way, she chose the Weed grass to add to her drink which I can't, unfortunately, digest! Other than that, we love Juice it Up! Keep it Up!<//review>

This was my first time stopping at this store. My daughter was visiting the ATT Store next door. So my mother in law and I walked in and stood at the counter for a few minutes. We were not greeted, did not receive a one moment please, nothing! We looked at each other and we both were thinking the same exact thing. They won’t get my money today. We just walked right out. Most locations yell greetings as you walk inside or at least acknowledge your presence. Very disappointing!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I’ve been buying smoothies from here for a long time and customer service at this store has significantly improved. I don’t know if the management has changed but staff is extremely nice and friendly. Getting very positive vibes overall. And they serve delicious healthy smoothies with a smile.

<text>I used to work at this place when I was 19 and the customer service I provided was GREAT! The owner(s) of this franchise are good people and are always focused on providing their patrons with fast and friendly service. The only reason I can think of as to why some people might say the customer service *is or *was bad is likely do to the hiring of some kids straight out of High School looking for their first job which can be a detriment sometimes because such "kids" aren't always MATURE enough to realize that quality service is a vital skill in the workforce.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I Always like going to this juice it up , the staff there always make my day. I appreciate how the staff/management are always on it by keeping the place tidy and always helpful when it comes down to recommendations . The Juice It Up by my house is a little closer but I still drive to this one , I always tell people that this place is the spot. Always friendly and calm environment.</Review>

We received great customer service from the girl behind the counter.  She was very patient with us as we didn't know what to choose.. Had the Rejuvenator smoothie after a hot day outside and it was very refreshing! Highly recommended!< /Review>

The place is great. My smoothie was good. But they really need to work on their customer service. I didn't feel welcomed at all while in there. I didn't even receive a greeting. And the workers just stared at me blankly until I ordered. The people at Jamba Juice are way better at their friendliness. I hope they reconsider how they treat their customers.<//review>

< review>
I've been to this location 3 times in the past 2 months and nothing is wrong with the products it's whoever's behind the  counter.  The customer service sucks,and the ladies I've dealt with act and look like they don't wanna deal with customers today in particular  I asked for extra spinach and a vita boost to be added into my smoothie and I didn't  get that... sooo I won't be coming back to this location tired of their customer service</review>

My wife and I went in before our work out and the lady was so rude because we only had a $100 bill ...like you don't have to be super sarcastic to serve drinks or decline our money because you can't count to make change 😎< /Text>

It was very organized, quick and easy. And felt especially safe because it was outdoors! Get your vaccine, please. It's so easy. And this location made it even easier. 🧡< /review>

The Center for Family Health and education  had a wonderful set up for covid vaccines. Very organized, easy to schedule. It really was a reassuring experience. So glad an institution like this exists in my community</text>

<text>Everything was great, staff was organized, well equipped, good at processing, fast and excellent at  administration of the vaccine. The only thing that was unclear was parking since cones were out front, so I assumed lot was full. It wasn’t but that was my mistake in assuming lot was closed when I just needed to wait a minute.</text>< pictures>

Yesterday, I went to the Center for Family Health and Education for my COVID19 Vaccine. It was a easy and painless visit. The staff at CFFHAE are all knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. They are organized and communicate very clearly as soon as you arrive with the registration process and the steps involved to get everyone vaccinated while also adhering to the recommended social distancing regulations. Great experience. Great staff. And great mission serving the underserved!</text>

<review>I visited the care on Feb 10th 2021 for a checkup regarding my sickness. The doctor ordered blood test to see if there in infection. I gave my blood on same day 10feb, the nurse told me to check back after 2 weeks. I called the office on second week Monday the phone operator told me they don’t have my reports and asked me to call back on Friday. I called the office and no one answered me. So I decided to call them this week today, no answer on call. So I drove to the clinic and asked the front desk associate about my report, she looked into the system and told me they don’t have my reports. I am confused here, it’s almost three weeks and they don’t have my reports. I told her I took the test between feb 8-10, she immediately got up from her stair and went inside to talk to someone. She came and told me they have my reports but the responsible person didn’t notice. I mean come on after three, they don’t call me the patient, I have to call them to check on reports. Then I asked her to give my reports, she said he can’t go that I have to take an appointment with my provider and next appointment is March 8th which is one more week to see what’s going on inside me. What if there’s some urgent care that need to taken care of? Then i asked her to speak with manager, she came I explained her my situation. She gave me same answer need to take appointment. The thing is they aren’t telling how did they lost track of my reports ? So after all discussion the manager Booked me the phone appointment for tomorrow March 5th and after the call I have to again go to the clinic to pick my reports. What a waste of time.
Things to notice: the front desk associate don’t have single respect towards the me patient.
If someone from Administration team looking this, I would recommend to improve the Traning to the workers in this place.
Thank you for your hospitality and care.
The single star is for Provider.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Had an “appointment” for 5:30.
Took 1 and a half hours to get vaccinated. I think that’s to be expected with the amount of people getting their vaccine.
Worth it.< /Text>

<Date>1603924872053</Date><rating>1< /rating><text>im so severely disappointed with CFHE. ive been a patient here for years and its slowly but surely become a cesspool. expect rude staff, hour plus wait times and no one knowing the reason for your visit, despite your constant reminders.

anticipate staff somehow losing your appointment slot yet not allowing a walk-in appointment even though youre already there, even brushing off requests for a flu shot. (it took over a month before they finally gave me my shot) doctors taking their lunch break during your appointment, thus making you wait longer.

ive had 4 separate psychiatrists and 2 PCPs in a span of about two years, with NO ONE communicating any of this with me until i figured it out during scheduled appointments.

this place goes through staff and doctors so much without any communication. theyre unprofessional, unorganized and definitely not worth your time. i genuinely pity remaining patients, they deserve so much better.< /text>< pictures>

We didn’t confirm the appointment when the called the day before so when gave our appointment away and refused to see us. We are out of medication. When we asked what we should do they gave no advice. The woman at the front desk never even apologized. There was literally no one else there. They easily could have seen us. Even worse is they charged us for a previous appointment for absolutely nothing. One person asked questions that could have been answered by a questionnaire and made offensive comments during it. It seemed like it was his first time doing it. This place is what’s wrong with the health care system. We thought we were so lucky for finding it. We were wrong. They are awful. Don’t fall for their scam.< /review>

<text>They take hours just to even call you in. One MA canceled my appointment without telling me so I came in and had to reschedule cause the wouldn’t see me that day. The phlebotomist on the floor probes/ fishes for your veins which is against the National Health Association’s guidelines. They scheduled vaccination without actually having the vaccines so I had to come in another day, despite already being there in person. The PA’s there are lovely but the whole system is backed up.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>The wait is long but I would not change my doctor. I see Ms. Martinez and out of all the doctors I have had in the past she is the first one that truly has tried to help me. Thanks to her I have found the origin of most of my ailments. I know the wait is long and annoying but I really would wait days if necessary. She is also the one doctor you see at the clinic the most. Thanks to her I have found medications that have helped my health and I have found the specialists that have further my treatment.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c290d1cd8113c3:0xaa5aa29c6948cb71</gmap_id></record>

As a super rude person if you tell him something he turns around laughs and speaks ill of the person. And not to mention the repsectionist disques. 😲😳🙁 and not to mention the long hours you have to wait in the waiting room and they still make you wait in the room for another hour so that the doctor only lasts 5 minutes with you ..

El personal es malisimo la unica que es buena es la doctora mayra pero todos Los de mas empleados no sirven para nada son super groseros especialmente la disque manager.

<Review>(Translated by Google) This place has a bad service.
I arrived at 10:45 a.m. because my appointment was at 11 a.m. for the pediatrician to attend to my 5-day-old baby.
There was only one person before me and for them to take care of me they had to spend 3 hours so that they will check on my baby.
The truth is a place that I do not recommend because any doctor attends you when you are looking for a specialist for your baby.

(Original)
Este lugar cuenta con un mal.servicio.
Llegue a las 10:45am porque mi cita era a las 11am para que la.pediatra atendiera a mi bebe de 5 días de nacida.
Solo habia una persona antes que yo y para que me atendieran tuvieron que pasar 3 horas para que me revisarán a mi bebe.
La verdad es un lugar que no recomiendo porque te atiende cualquier doctor cuando vas buscando un especialista para tu bebe.<//Review>< date>

Receptionists are the worst people they can hire, rude and ill-mannered ... and the nurses arrive drunk at work and without any embarrassment dare to say that they are late because the night before they "farted" with those kinds of words. .It is a lack of respect for humanity these people ..., the receptionist treats you as if you were stupid. There is no use doing anything .. attend to whomever they feel like ... and it is easier to attend to someone who doesn't have a site that if you do ... there are no words to describe how ridiculous this place has become ..

<username>Day Bernal<//username><text>(Translated by Google) Almost three hours of waiting and then one more in the room and the doctor sees you no more than 10 minutes or less, they do not read your exams to see how you came out, I think they do not even review the file before the patient arrives and then if you have any infection urinary or there are problems in the blood test they tell you until you get the other appointment with them (if you ask how the test came out) Pregnant do not go there!

(Original)
Casi tres horas d espera y luego una más dentro del cuarto y el médico te ve nada más 10 minutos o menos, no leen tus exámenes para ver cómo saliste, creo q ni revisan el expediente antes q llegue el paciente y luego si tienes alguna infección urinaria o hay problemas en el examen  de sangre  te lo dicen hasta q te toca la otra cita con ellos(si es que tú preguntas como salió el examen) Embarazadas  no vayan allí!</text></record></dataset><record>

Creation of a pepperoni, onion, spinach, and cheddar savory crepe. Also the amazing crepe...banana, strawberries, and Nutella. Sprinkled with some light powdered sugar on top. Both were so delicious and we'll definitely be back to try the others 🙃</Text>

< Review>
The girl made us one of the best chi teas that we ever had in the longest time!  Perfect amount of sweetness where you can actually finish the drink without getting a sugar high overdose!   It was so good, I had to call the owner and thank him personally for his business when I was there last month! 🤗😋😋😋 thank you once again!</Review>

<Review>Great mom and pop shop. Some of the best frozen yogurt I've ever had. They had gluten free options (even for crepes) which was a nice surprise. The owner is friendly and made us feel welcomed. Would recommend.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPToFha--1P4WzDBmlLKlUFX7kkP42mSxid8nCj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOV-3x5CBAVJrqHEekNrTk10r4oOavpWZOuO3sY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>The yogurt was nice and creamy, the service was great, and we felt completely safe. The social distancing setup ensures you’re the only customers in the store while placing your order and waiting for it to be prepared. Once you have it, there are tables outside in the shade where you can enjoy it. It was breezy and pleasant, which added to the feeling of safety. We visit often and it’s always a great experience.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Had some time to kill and was looking for frozen yogurt. Glad we gave this independent a shot. My son liked the yogurt so much we went out of our way to go back the next day. We have tried all the chains. Not only fresh tasting but really delicious. You would think yogurt was all the same, but Froglanders tastes the best. NOTE: we are yogurt purist and add no topping, but they had a great selection that we could see.</review><response>{'time': 1558314196963, 'text': 'Thanks a lot Stan, means a lot coming from yogurt purists and re-enforces all the work we do to keep the yogurt tasting great all the time.

< review>
Stopped by this place to grab something sweet before the comedy show across the street. The staff was friendly and welcoming, I'll give them that. But thats the only positive thing I've got to say. One member was in the middle of changing out the trash (it was close to closing) when he offered me to try samples. I chose one and it took me a second to realize he handed me the sample with the same hands he wss changing out the trash. Then i noticed All the fruit flies. I get it, nature is hard to fight. But they were everywhere in the toppings area. I decided to not get anything. My friend, however, had already ordered a coffee. It took so long that I left and got in line for the show, and after that, still took 16 more minutes. For a coffee. Will not go here again.< /review>

Let me assure you that our employees are trained in sanitary ways and they know they should wash their hands and this doesn’t typically happen at our place.

All I can say is that this is the first instance of this complaint and I already addressed it within minutes. So thank you for bringing it to my attention. I also have to apologize for your friends’ coffee as they seem to have forgotten about the order in the middle of two rushes that they had.

One of my favorite ice cream discoveries in CA. We got the Captain Crunch and the Charcoal Rice flavors and they were both incredible! Definitely preferred the charcoal toasted rice flavor more, but both were top notch ice creams. Highly recommend it!< /Review>

The frozen yogurt was delicious and the shake was fantastic, but the customer service was really above and beyond for us. We brought our three young daughters in and the man working was super responsive and patient with them. My oldest daughter (8) said that if we ate at The Taco Stand and then ate here for dessert, that's the only food she'd ever want again. Kudos for a job well done!</Review>

One of the best yogurt places I’ve ever been to!  The staff is extremely friendly and everyone there makes sure you always leave happy!  It is a family owned business and they take care of the palce and always make sure tables are clean, floor and etc.  I really want to thank Shah personally for being there and helping me out every time I get yogurt.  It’s like every time I go I’m always checking up on old friend it’s yogurt plus the experience.  Yogurt is always fresh and  I noticed they clean the machines and topping trays very often making sure customers get the best experience there. I would definitely recommend this place 10 out of 10 I wouldn’t take my time to write such a large paragraph of it wasn’t special and if you’re reading this and you’re deciding which yogurt shop to go to or you just want a late night snack this is the place to be!!!  Thank you for everything and thank you for the amazing customer  Service! Much appreciated! I will be back! ❤️👍<//Text>

Friendly staff, good prices and good location. They have tables in front, and it is raised up on top of a 3-stair, giving a pretty good view of one of the busiest intersections of the main part of town on Pearl St. A good place to pass the time and see old friends. Used to be a very popular spot for my friends and I during the school year.<//Review>

<Text>Great place for delicious frozen yogurt!  I first tried Froglander's frozen yogurt way back in 1988 while I was working in Solana Beach at Torrey Pines Bank.  I ate their yogurt quite often and enjoyed it.  That first year in California I lost 30 pounds!  Now I just found out that they have crepes and some are made with buckwheat which is gluten free.  I will look forward to trying them soon!  Give Froglander's a try -- you won't be disappointed!  Brought back good memories when I saw the Froglander's frozen yogurt store last Saturday in La Jolla!<//Text><username>Rebekah Polanchak</username><resp>{'time': 1560890511797, 'text': 'Thank you Rebekah.

The best Acai bowl I've ever had. The acai isn't  too sweet like other places making the honey a good add-in, whereas other places the honey would make it way too sweet. The fruits were very fresh and saw him cut some up to put in the bowl.< /text>

<Review>We love Froglanders. It’s a neighborhood institution, a local small business with very friendly staff and delicious treats (must have affogato).

< review>
This is the best business I've been to in La Jolla! The owner is super friendly and always  personally offering samples of yogurt he changes frequently to keep it amazing and interesting. It is far better than a self serve place for sanitary reasons and to make it feel like a friendly, family owned stop. We love the interior, with high ceiling,  and my daughter and her friend counted nearly 40 decorative frogs in the place for fun. We come here 2-3 times after a class. The owner even makes me any type of coffee I want that's not on the menu, like Mexican mocha coffee or ghirardelli chocolate coffee, or even kona coffee yogurt iced coffee! We were here 2 years ago and the owner even remembered us. Now he's making frozen yogurt pies and maybe frozen yogurt cakes next that will sure to be a hit as ice cream cakes tend to soften too slowly! Can't wait! Thank you, Froglanders!!<//review>

< review>
At the yogurt place in La Jolla the last week in the morning, my sister and I tried their strawberry, nutella and banana crepe the A La Foli and cheese and ham, Je Suis Unique crepe. My sister enjoyed the fact that her savory crepe was gluten free and they use separate cooking😁 utensils. They we were very satisfied to say the least. Delicious!🍽.</review>

I had the mint (sugar free) icecream made with splenda. I should've had a sample of it first, but didn't think it was going to taste as bad as it did. I don't like the set up because you can't add your own topping like most yogurt places in san diego<//Review>

< Review>
My new go-to salon for all of my hair needs, whether it’s a quick, cute buzz & cut, picking up my essential hair products, or going blonde...this is your one-stop shop for sure! I went in for full blonde highlights today. I showed them photo examples of what I wanted and they nailed it EXACTLY! And the color is truly beautiful! Take a look at my pics for yourself. The Maxi Hair Salon staff listen, they are kind, they are affordable, and they are technically-proficient. I cannot emphasize enough how pleased I am with my results! So happy!! A million thanks, Maxi Hair Salon!!</Review>

I stated growing long hair once I got to Berkeley because I couldn't find any barbers that I was satisfied with. Eventually longer hair just made me even more picky to decide where I wanted get it cut. However Ellie is super competent and over the past year she's done an amazing job whether it's long or short hair and has even made sure to always give me tips on how to style it!</Review>

She is extremely meticulous and always left my eyebrows perfectly shaped and just the right thickness. She plucks instead of threading or waxing, so there is minimal pain and your skin won't be irritated afterward. Ellie is also very warm and friendly, and her price is reasonable ($15).

<text>I went to this hair salon to have my hair done for an event, and they did a wonderful job. I asked for an intricately styled updo (showed a picture), and the final result (see uploaded picture) looked exactly as I wanted it. Very reasonably priced ($90) for a full hour of work. Would highly recommend.<//text>< GmapID>

Wanted to cut and color my hair and decided to give this place a try since all the good reviews and  my friends talked so highly of them. Well, I wasn’t disappointed.  I got a beautiful, natural balayage. I get compliments on it all the time and some think is my natural hair color!
What I was hoping for and beyond! Very reasonable prices too.  I love my hair. Will definitely come back.<//review>

They are also super personable, and will provide you with an excellent service each time. I love coming here, it’s not over priced either and I think they give the students in the area a pretty good discount. Highly recommend them!!</text></record></dataset><record>

The place is clean and well-managed, and the stylists are professional, friendly and adept at their craft. I was really happy witha few of their specialty services, including a Deva cut for curly hair, and eyebrow threading. Normally, Deva cuts can run on the expensive side, but the stylists at Maxi salon do a professional job at a student-friendly price. I'm really happy with the service I got, and will definitely return!</Text>< rate>

I have been a regular for over 15 YEARS and I have referred many friends there over the years . I once referred a student of mine there who later moved to Scotland for her PHD but still makes a point of going to Maxi when she is visiting!  true story and I have many more like this! Anyone I send there becomes a regular regardless of age group!  Very high quality work!</Review>

Finally I have found someone that really knows how to cut wavy very layered hair. I went to Lien (Lynn) and she took so much time with me and listened to what I wanted and did the best layered cut I have had in literally 30 years. She also waxed and dyed my brows and did a fantastic job. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her to anyone! The price was very reasonable too. :)< /text>

I've been a satisfied customer of Maxi Hair Salon for many years and enjoyed not only my interactions with the staff but also observing the diversity of her clientele. I've heard everything from an in-depth conversation on the best shade of purple to grandmothers stating they need a great style for a hot date. They do a great job with men and women, I’m envious of some styles for males that just wouldn’t work on me (long past my 20’s, lol). The shop is clean and airy and foot traffic makes for good people watching while you’re in the chair. The online booking site is a breeze to use and shows you both availability and prices.< /Review>

I love this salon! We use to live in Berkeley and went there for over 20 years. Now that we moved to LA we still try to coordinate our trips so we can still get our hair and my eyebrows done there.  They are so good at what they do.  They do amzing job for my husband and my sons haircut as well as high lighting and cutting my difficult hair. Very reasonable prices as well. Highly recommended them!
If I could give more stars i would! :)</Review>

Been going on and off for over a year depending on where I lived. But as soon as I moved back to the bay area, I was looking forward to making an appointment with Ellie at Maxi Hair Salon. Ellie, Hannah and other staff have been super friendly and always enjoy seeing you coming in. Ellie remembers what kind of hair style you want and you always leave the place, looking forward to coming back. I really enjoy Maxi Hair salon.</Review>

You have to watch out for non-English or bad English speaking businesses. On top of that you give them clear speaking instructions and later on when you complain about them giving the wrong haircut, they have this attitude of you  being wrong. Only the owner speaks good English. It's hard to find a good barber that speaks good English and good customer service!!</Text>

Ellie is my favorite! She is a wizard who knows how to trim split ends along the length of the hair without taking too much off the bottom< /text>

Ive been coming here for 18yrs now. Im in the quality assurance field. Before I came to Maxi Hair, I used to go to L.A. every month for my haircut. Think about that for a second. Why would i come to a place for 18yrs if they didnt to A+ work especially when Im about quality of work? Price and quality of work is what matters; Maxi Hair has both.<//text>

I have been going to Maxi Hair Care since they opened back in the early 1990's when I a student at Cal.  While I no longer live in Berkeley, I still go miles out of my way to Maxi's to get my hair cut since they always do a great job.  I highly recommend them.<//text>

I’ve been working here since 1992 with my very skilled partner since then. \xa0After reopening the salon we were on a search of finding a third person whom was as qualified. \xa0The new person whom cut your hair presented herself with an outstanding resume and we thought we had found our match! Unfortunately that wasn’t the case and you had come in during her short time here. She is no longer with us. It is very unfortunate that you had such a bad experience. I am truly sorry! Also very unfortunate for us to get punished with a bad review. We work very hard to keep up a good reputation.\n\nBest,\nEllie/ owner\nMaxi Hair Salon'}< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I had been searching for a mid size SUV when I came across a listing for
a Chevy Equinox at, Affordable Kars. After test driving a few cars in my area, I decided to drive out to Affordable Kars with my mechanic to have a closer look at the Equinox.
We showed up to the lot without an appointment and were greeted by Sylvia and Jose. They were both friendly, personable and very knowledgeable about all the cars on their lot. I liked a few of the cars they had but I was really there for the Equinox.
After a test drive and quick inspection, my mechanic assured me it was a good car and that I should buy it. So i did.
I drive the car daily and take frequent trips to the desert with it. I've called Affordable Kars a few times over the past year for advice on small things like oil changes etc.. and they are always there to assist me.
I purchased my car from Affordable Kars in 2019 and all I can say is, this was a great buy.
Id like to give a big Thank You shoutout to Affordable Kars, Sylvia and Jose for an awesome, stress free, used car buying experience.

I highly recommend anyone looking for a good used car to give them a call. Or, just show up like I did.</text>

<text>The purchasing process went smooth enough and we were ok with everything.
However the dealership was not honest with us about some of paperwork and we ended have to pay two years worth DMV registration fees for a car we just purchased.
They did not return calls when we tried to follow up for explanation.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

<Review>LOVE SYLVIA. There is no car dealer more caring and helpful than her. My mom bought a car three years ago, it still runs perfect. My best friend bought a car not long after. Again, it still runs amazing. My cousin also bought a car from there, same result. Finally, it was my turn!! I went in and bought my car with Sylvia, and she was so helpful and did everything she could to make us comfortable. I love my car, and I’ve been driving it like crazy. Working with her was quick and amazing, and she does what she can to make it work for you. She’s an angel, and I highly recommend Affordable Kars to anyone looking to get a new vehicle. Just remember to ask for Sylvia! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnVKI1eA34yOjma_Bf3I13ktQZWtsSYkVjtQDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2cc2c258eb12d:0xd1b1c6263c83aeff<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sylvia is one of the most friendliest people I have ever met. I don't usually like car dealership, but she's the owner and she truly cares about the individuals she helps. She also speaks Spanish which is a definitely a plus. If you need a car there is no one I would rather trust with my car buying or selling experience.< /review>

<review>Sylvia and her staff Are amazing! This is the place to go especially if you have bad credit and not a lot to put down! She not only found me something affordable with my limitations but she also has saved me a lot of money by letting me bring the car to her for repairs at her cost! I was quoted almost triple by good tires for a leak and she was quick to arrange me to come in within an hour to get everything fixed. I'm so grateful for finding them!</review><rate>5<//rate><GmapID>0x80c2cc2c258eb12d:0xd1b1c6263c83aeff</GmapID>< username>

Bought a Jeep Cherokee in 2004, then switched it out for a F 150 in 2007 and then switched to a Scion TC in 2012. All cars have never broken down or given me any major trouble.  Overall, I keep going back because of the great service.<//text>

Be careful when you buy cars have boughten a car and the owner does not take responsibility for the issues of the vehicles she sells cars that are trash don’t buy cars here. Great customer service fake cars she’s a two face. She gives you a great story saying that her cars are the best and they are the worst she doesn’t take owenership for types of cars she is selling. I as a customer tried reasoning but wouldn’t help me out with my car yet she gave insurance for what no point never will I buy cars here again ... THE WORST.< /Review>

Worst place ever bought a car with nothing but problems
Broken axle, broken radiator

It was to have know since th hey created fake income and changed amounts on my bank statements.

< Review>
So I bought a car from this lady name sylvia who is a sales manager there at affordable kars. I released a car from her lot! And now I am spending all this money that is nessary that I don’t have. On parts for the car. Why is affordable kars. Selling cars that will have to be getting fixed in one month or 2. When you just released a vehicles for a high price. Not worth it there! Please make sure on your car decisions people! Open your eyes at this lot! Affordable kars will steal your money! Not worth! Worst dealer I’ve ever been to in my life</Review>

Rude service,  cars are ridiculous iperformance.  To take of any car that you buy from them that comes with problems they just  have come over and over just to tell you they  can't take of right now.  This must stop , people must  take the  case to BBB.<//text>

<user_name>Color Chase<//user_name><date>1603069217384<//date><rating>5<//rating><review>I had been searching for a mid size SUV when I came across a listing for
a Chevy Equinox at, Affordable Kars. After test driving a few cars in my area, I decided to drive out to Affordable Kars with my mechanic to have a closer look at the Equinox.
We showed up to the lot without an appointment and were greeted by Sylvia and Jose. They were both friendly, personable and very knowledgeable about all the cars on their lot. I liked a few of the cars they had but I was really there for the Equinox.
After a test drive and quick inspection, my mechanic assured me it was a good car and that I should buy it. So i did.
I drive the car daily and take frequent trips to the desert with it. I've called Affordable Kars a few times over the past year for advice on small things like oil changes etc.. and they are always there to assist me.
I purchased my car from Affordable Kars in 2019 and all I can say is, this was a great buy.
Id like to give a big Thank You shoutout to Affordable Kars, Sylvia and Jose for an awesome, stress free, used car buying experience.

I highly recommend anyone looking for a good used car to give them a call. Or, just show up like I did.</review>< pics>

< Review>
The purchasing process went smooth enough and we were ok with everything.
However the dealership was not honest with us about some of paperwork and we ended have to pay two years worth DMV registration fees for a car we just purchased.
They did not return calls when we tried to follow up for explanation.<//Review>

<text>LOVE SYLVIA. There is no car dealer more caring and helpful than her. My mom bought a car three years ago, it still runs perfect. My best friend bought a car not long after. Again, it still runs amazing. My cousin also bought a car from there, same result. Finally, it was my turn!! I went in and bought my car with Sylvia, and she was so helpful and did everything she could to make us comfortable. I love my car, and I’ve been driving it like crazy. Working with her was quick and amazing, and she does what she can to make it work for you. She’s an angel, and I highly recommend Affordable Kars to anyone looking to get a new vehicle. Just remember to ask for Sylvia! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Sylvia is one of the most friendliest people I have ever met. I don't usually like car dealership, but she's the owner and she truly cares about the individuals she helps. She also speaks Spanish which is a definitely a plus. If you need a car there is no one I would rather trust with my car buying or selling experience.</text><Time>1567291443896</Time>< rate>

<Text>Sylvia and her staff Are amazing! This is the place to go especially if you have bad credit and not a lot to put down! She not only found me something affordable with my limitations but she also has saved me a lot of money by letting me bring the car to her for repairs at her cost! I was quoted almost triple by good tires for a leak and she was quick to arrange me to come in within an hour to get everything fixed. I'm so grateful for finding them!</Text><gmap_id>0x80c2cc2c258eb12d:0xd1b1c6263c83aeff< /gmap_id>< pictures>

I got a car from them and a day later turns out that the transmission is bad I had to pay $4,500.00 for a new transmission and pay for a new water pump I’m keeping the car but I think that they should pay for half the bill< /review>

Bought a Jeep Cherokee in 2004, then switched it out for a F 150 in 2007 and then switched to a Scion TC in 2012. All cars have never broken down or given me any major trouble.  Overall, I keep going back because of the great service.<//review>

<Review>Be careful when you buy cars have boughten a car and the owner does not take responsibility for the issues of the vehicles she sells cars that are trash don’t buy cars here. Great customer service fake cars she’s a two face. She gives you a great story saying that her cars are the best and they are the worst she doesn’t take owenership for types of cars she is selling. I as a customer tried reasoning but wouldn’t help me out with my car yet she gave insurance for what no point never will I buy cars here again ... THE WORST.<//Review><UserId.>112259933569127599288<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

And now I am spending all this money that is nessary that I don’t have. On parts for the car. Why is affordable kars. Selling cars that will have to be getting fixed in one month or 2. When you just released a vehicles for a high price. Not worth it there! Please make sure on your car decisions people! Open your eyes at this lot! Affordable kars will steal your money! Not worth!

You will have to be putting in money into the car real soon. Unbelievable nightmare. I bought a Nissan from here. Had to spend 600$ on a tune up. And I just took the car out the lot! That’s how you know the cars are wicced here. I’m very disappointed in this business. They need a lot of work on their cars at this lot. And they know it they’re self. Mickey Mouse cars.. 😞.

Rude service,  cars are ridiculous iperformance.  To take of any car that you buy from them that comes with problems they just  have come over and over just to tell you they  can't take of right now.  This must stop , people must  take the  case to BBB.<//Review>

< Review>
Chill spot in the neighborhood with almost all of what u may need! Seems like it's more so worth it to bring cash b/c they charge a card fee. Staff are nice except one of the security guards (tall BM) I found to be overbearing and unprofessional. Selling your hand sanitizer, i get it its cool and its natural, I would even buy one but not everyone has to engage you in an extremely extroverted or flirty way. Some folks would like to just make their shopping trip in peace.< /Review>

Considering the COVID situation, I believe the store is taking proper precautions therein.
First time, so I was Looking, ya know?
Pricing was actually the reason I left my side of Ktown. The hours too, but mainly pricing
Store looked exceptional, bright, welcoming, varietal, and not smelling like the inside of my older sister's purse when I was a kid.
Quick service, cute cashier 😉, great stop!
Glad I came.</Review>

<review>Friendly Neighborhood dispensary! Amazing and friendly staff and security. With deals and specials every day of the week there will always be an offer for someone.

Super clean store with a lot of variety and even some accessories if you find yourself missing something. (Papers, lighters, pipes, etc.)

Ask about their rewards system. Points back for each purchase is money back in your pocket!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I checked in as an regular customer but did realized you can also place an pick up order and skip the line. I purchased there house brand "Coast" which is KING LOUIE top shelf!!

<Review>Everything you imagine in a genuine, friendly, L.A California Dispensary! My Budtender Sky was AMAZING!! Friendly, knowledgeable, super welcoming and patient. It was my first time in a Dispensary and I had a lot of questions lol. She didn't mind one bit or make me feel rushed or pressured. I actually told her I didn't want to bother her anymore and I would check out the edibles next time! 5 stars for the establishment and 10 stars for sky! Oh, and she gave me a bag of extra free goodies +20% off for my first time! Premium flower, Extracts, disposable and screw on vapes, edibles and more and absolute amazing customer service. I would recommend this place to anyone! Definitely my standard for any other Dispensary I visit.<//Review>< Response>

Wow. That GELATO THOUGH!! (The Heights box) was one of the best highs I’ve had in a while. And I love the design of their boxes, you can really tell the effort that was put in. Loved everything about it!!<//Review>

Great service, fast and friendly. I purchased an amazing heavy hitter set. One of the best batteries I have ever purchased! Ever! The cartridge is uniquely designed to evaporate all of the liquid. The absolute best! I also love the prices and quality to their house cartridges. I am originally from San Diego and these are by far the best I have ever tried. The taste is all there. Mine was nice and dense in THC as well. They also happen to have  a great point rewards program that works  great. The prices are fairly generous. Back in SD all you'd get is a free rice crispy, "mildly medicated" or a free dab of pure slab. Best case scenario a 'Minnie La Familia' chocolate. This place is genuinely the best!</text>

Super clean dispensary and one of the nicer ones I've ever been to. Prices are a little higher than I'm used to seeing but that's what you get in Los Angeles and at a dispensary like this. Their employees were super nice and patient throughout the whole time we were there. I would definitely recommend going back to this location if I'm in the area again.< /Text>

Love the name & LOVE THIS DISPENSARY! The staff has always been so welcoming and accommodating. I always enjoy my visits when I go.  Only place I go to get my fave edibles from LA FAMILIA. The churro Rice Krispies are so delicious. If you’re near or from LA and you haven’t visited do yourself a favor and swing by.</review>

<Text>Literally my favorite shop in Los Angeles. Love that they have such a good variety of things (i.e. Flower, edibles, vapes, prerolls & they have even added glassware!) As an avid consumer I like that they are always expanding their menu, the staff is always very knowledgeable & pleasant. Keep up the good work!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>This shop is legit! The showroom is on another level, the budtenders are educated and want to help you find what you’re looking for. It was my first time and the tender was super helpful with helping me find a nice sativa and edible (love my Smokiez).
I’ll be coming back for the 420 Friday deal!!!</Review>< time>

<text>This place is the bomb!!! I'm a huge fan of their LA Kush flower - great price for great flower and the packaging is dope. On Tuesday nights they give out free tacos with your purchase, YUM. Even their merch is fire! While you're there make sure to check out their Heavy Hitters section fully stocked with 1gs, disposables, batteries, and live resin :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>Nice friendly service but not a lot of selection and what they did have was generally over priced in my opinion. Overall, it was ok. A last resort for me though next time. I was also very disappointed that the cute girl behind the desk never even asked me out on a date or nothing 😒.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This place has gone downhill in the last 2 years. I would avoid if you have an alternative, LA Kush in Echo Park has nothing special going for it anymore.

Most of the budtenders don’t care anymore, they just want you in and out ASAP. If asked, their advice doesn’t go beyond indica = chill and sativa = energy.

The prices are also pretty shocking in 2020, more so than justified by the price increases seen in the rest of the California market. Their oz prices increased by about 50% and quality reduced drastically in return. If you want a decent eighth from them, be prepared to shell out.

Edit: I visited this morning to redeem my rewards and mark my final visit to your dispensary. Your bud tender Liz is the only redeeming factor you have going for you. Have her train the rest of your rude staff.</Review>

Really nice dispensary, dont let the outside fool you. The entry was quick and easy and as a first time patient I received 20% off my purchase! I was informed of the daily specials and received excellent service. The bud tender really knew her stuff, unlike other places I've been and recommended a brand I wouldn't have otherwise tried. Her recommendation was quite fire. If you're looking for a great dispensary with excellent service and reasonable prices...Los Angeles Kush is IT!</text>

Due to the coronavirus, we order our medicine for delivery. We waited 4 hours. When the driver finally arrived, he said he had to retrieve it. When we called the office we were told that we had to pick it up. We have been cash paying customer's for a minute. We're done. Bad business. Smoker's lives matter.</Review>

<text>They close at ten. I get there at 9:50 and they say they can’t let me in because their filled to capacity. I stand outside and look on my phone to find a dispensary that’s open later. I find a place and end up getting my Uber at 10:30pm. During that time, only two customers came out of they building before some of the staff left. Never going back there again.< /text><Time>1588311130709< /Time>< pics>

Excellent and friendly service. They have a great variety of flower to choose from. Prices are fair and decent for recreational usage. Employees are helpful and patient. I highly recommend this spot if it's your first time getting recreational marijuana.</review>

<Name>Z T</Name><Review>I love La Kush mainly because its the only packaged flower I've ever enjoyed. I've been getting Red Box at other stores for a while and enjoying it. But Today I went to this store to get Red Box and felt the strain was a little different. It was in an all red container instead of the usual glass one I buy. Would like to know why.<//Review>< resp>

Nice staff, good product, kinda pricey, but I will give them another shot, cant say it is my go to place quite yet? But if Im comparing it to LitCo or Shiva's both in the Downtown this is a better situation for us Locals imho *easy first time experience*< /Review>

Security guards were rude.

I wasn't allowed to go in, despite having my ID with a paper to extend the expiration date. (The day prior I was told to bring the paper and I could go in) Went to 4 other dispensaries and none others had an issue ....

The prices are higher than others, and the tax was the price of another g of wax, which is insane.

I'd skip it and go to Buddha Company downtown.<//Text>

The service I received was mediocre and in some ways insulting.  I asked questions, she rolled her eyes and gave me short answers.  I wanted to see more products but I instructed the store had minimal products due to low stock.  For my first time, I was disappointed.

I recommend do not come to this dispensary.  Overpriced, mediocre service and no love for the clients.<//Review>

Tax is 35% here an elsewhere unless you have mmj rec/card. 99% of dispensary waive the full 35% tax for mmj rec/card holders, here they only take off 5% for your rec. so still 30% tax? Rec/card work same so I don’t understand why the discrepancy. mmj card holders  pay 20% tax which is still too high. I could maybe live with 15% for rec/cards. They have a wide variety of selection so you will definitely find something that suits your needs. The prices aren’t that great to begin with so the tax is terrible on top but the quality is good. Big plus is they do take credit cards and only dispensary I know that takes credit so I added a star just for that. Also one day a week as a special deal the take either 10% or 15% off the tax for only an hour. That will probably be the route I go if returning or low on physical cash and use credit. If you want quality and don’t care about spending a little more $ then average, you won’t be disappointed< /Review>< Pictures>

Two stars because they always seem to have what I want, but they get minus three stars because customer service can be very poor sometimes. A lot of the times when I go here my anxiety levels go up due to rudeness, lacking knowledge about what's going on in their own shop, and so many inconsistencies. Can't tell if they are a real shop or glorified drug dealers.</Text>

Nevermind the 34% TAX on EVERY purchase, but there’s a snobby atmosphere about the whole place. I was told once that because of the extremely ridiculous taxation, they try to provide their patients with “extra care”. Im still trying to figure out what that means, seeing as though I left my bike lock accidentally & they refused to even let me leave it my bike in the corner of their lobby. The recommended I leave my bike on the street...unlocked.....in the middle of downtown LA.

You said what now?

But, alas, I was desperate for some tree. Dropped my bike off at home & came back about 15 mins before they closed. Or so I thought. Google, Yelp, & Weedmaps must all have it wrong because  the shop ACTUALLY closes at 9:45p. It’s unfortunate that this is one of the only dispensaries near me but the hassle is not worth the convenience of the location or the quality of their product.< /Text>

<review>I did like then when they first opened,  you could always get $8 grams $10 grams, but not anymore,  they never have any at those prices,  considering the low income neighborhood they are located at most people can't really afford the more expensive stuff they carry, Everytime I see the doors open it surprises me, they even had to close up the parking lot across the street cause there not getting enough customers, Don't get me wrong,  they are very nice people,  security is tight! I love that,  they are friendly too, as is the rest of the staff, oh and no more $99 ounces whaaaaa, why so much change?</review><gmap_id>0x80c2c70bc773efcb:0x7e54a44316a5ffdc<//gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>M I< /Name></record>

< Review>
This is an edited review because things just keep getting better. The prices are good, the staff are friendly & knowledgeable. Props to the Security Guys they're on it........all of the time. A guy who was turned away asked me, as I left, if I would go for him. I didn't do it & having to bus it right now I was waiting for the bus, he asked to smell my bud & borrow my phone. My dumb ass let him do both, he was on it a bit & I was wanting it back. Anyways, I know that the guy in your lot was paying attention & had another guard sent out from the dispensary. I should have given him an idea I wanted to be left alone, but again, we've established I'm a dumb ass. I say hello to them 2-4 times a week for goodness sake! He got on the bus too I had to yank my phone back. The security guards were right & this creep was lewd & harassed me so that I had to get off early. Lesson learned. Thank you to your Security. I will come to this shop until it goes out of business......or they take me out in cuffs....lmao BTW.....I agree that I deserved to get jacked for behaving like that.</Review>

I didn't see their flowers so I don't have any comment.  What I came for was vape cartridges and the employee behind the counter didn't have any answers about the questions I had, like "how are these extracts made?"  Honestly, no answer.  Or "what kind of chemicals are in this?"  They don't know, can't answer.  Or ""What solvent, if any, was used to extract this?"
No answer at all.  Never mind the fact that when I finally had the product in my hand, it said "solvent free."  It would be more practical to run a place with people who know how to answer simple questions about the product they are selling.  And it's a bit on the pricey side: like Las Vegas prices.  Also, a message on the door about "closing it behind you when you leave," on the way out is not practical.  On my way out, I held the door open for the guy behind me, who didn't seem aware of the sign reminding him to close the door behind him.  This is cool, but he didn't see it because he was behind me, and i was holding it open.  It wasn't until I looked back behind me to see if it was closed that the security guard was standing there glaring at me, as if I had inconvenienced him and he had to close the door.  I mean, come on, you guys are running a business here, and you're making a lot of money , obviously, at least put some money up and install a mechanism which will enable the door to shut on it's own.  Passing the cost, AND the responsibility of closing the door onto the customer.  Could do better.</Text>

It’s 40 minutes past their advertised opening time on 4/20 ... still haven’t let a customer in. Also the combat ready security guards sprouting blue lives matters flags is unbelievable ...

Profit first company while patients are looking for medication ... stay away.</review>

On vacation so of course I have an out of state ID because of this the security guard was rude about how it's a fake ID and didn't let me in so anyone from out of state might not want to stop here the other places I went were much more friendly, and welcomed out of state visitors< /Text>
