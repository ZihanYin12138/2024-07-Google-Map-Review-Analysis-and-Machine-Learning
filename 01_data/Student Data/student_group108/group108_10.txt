When we found out there was a Mexican restaurant in Carmel, we had to go there. And it did not disappoint. We started off with margaritas and a watermelon salad. The drinks were great and the salad had a lot of flavor. Their entrees were a good size and delicious as well. We really liked this place and came back the next night for more margaritas.</Text>

The service and employee were 5 star!!! But unfortunately the beans and rice were very bland and the Tacos were fresh but nothing extremely flavorful. The middle eastern breakfast yogurt also lacked any flavor. I feel bad because the ambiance was beautiful and our servers were top notch! Great people, just needs to revamp the menu and add more flavor.</review>

<Review>We picked this place because we were craving Mexican food. When we arrived and looked at the menu, we thought we went to the wrong restaurant (completely different international dishes). Server explained that it changed ownership 3 days ago. The food was not good- salsa was basically just chopped tomatoes. The Roasted Beets salad was beets from a can (server and owner admitted and apologized for it). Steak taco was a bit salty with beans and rice (which was a strange yellow rice with carrots). The only decent thing was the guacamole. The staff was very friendly and the owner apologized multiple times. I think they have growing pains and may take time to be decent. It is not a Mexican restaurant.<//Review><gmapID>0x808de6152181b435:0x43a003242aa0af1e<//gmapID><UserId.>101131630820563095435</UserId.><Response>None</Response></record></dataset><record>

This restaurant has a great menu, prices are reasonable and drinks are good, service is a little slow and only one bathroom, but they are very kind. Homemade tortillas. The salsa is a 10 plus. I definitely will return over and over again. That's why I said 4 star's. I like the family ambiance. I'll return with my girlfriend again!!!!!!.</Text>

Food was spectacular, Sevilen wine was outstanding, dessert was phenomenal, service was very friendly and hospitable.  Food is fresh and prepared in house.  I had the stuffed eggplant (Karniyarik) and my wife had the Kofte.  Even the Baklava is made there!  Wow!  An all around A+.</review>< Pics>

<text>We vacationed in Carmel recently and ate dinner here - the food was great! What made it extra special was the kind, attentive, and friendly service. You could tell the folks who worked there took pride in their food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I saw a server bring over a candle centerpiece for a couple who was eating at the bar - it was a simple gesture but it was very sweet!<//text><name>Janelle Maur< /name><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

<review>My husband and I just moved to Carmel from Los Angeles.   We decided to walk in today about 2:00 pm and give it a try.    The food  was decent (not authentic Mexican food.  American Mexican food).  However, Ruben the waiter could not have been more RUDE to us.  I mean wow.  He was rude to everyone including a father and infant waiting for a table.    I’m a former waitress so for me, it was pretty disgusting as to how VERY rude he was.  He even looked mad.  Bad day maybe? Hate your job? NO excuse!

I didn’t take it personal but let’s just say we decided to take our food to go instead because he sucked all of the good energy out of the restaurant.

Shame on management for noticing.  It was obvious.   As new residents of the neighborhood, we will never walk in here again.</review></record></dataset><record>

Yet, this quant place does so with a charming interior, caring and attentive staff (two of whom I believe are the owners) and really delicious Mexican dishes. The guacamole is hand made and a slightly spicier version...a welcome improvement. The sauces and spices used were highly flavorful and felt more "real" than what we usually get. A worthy stop in this food crazy town.< /text><user>116562359053570032108<//user>< pics>

We ordered two vegetarian meals. The Tostado was puffy and overcooked. The content was very small and some of the ingredients were unrecognizable. The other entree was basically inedible, cactus something or other. The 5-star reviews must be from customers ordering meat dishes.  We had two Spanish sparkling wines, and one bottled beer. Our check was $63. Overpriced? Definitely.
Our one-star is for our server, Juan.
There are many traditional Mexican restaurants in this area that offer delicious, less expensive dishes.. Please visit them, and save your money.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>Stumbled across Artemis while heading over to try a different establishment. Was intrigued by the menu items, and thought we would give it a try.

So glad we did!  The Cornmeal Encrusted Seabass with Curry Mashed Potatoes & the Short Ribs Raviolis were amazing!! The service was also outstanding!!

Everything was just perfect actually.

They have a fairly diverse menu, but the kitchen seems to be delivering on all of them. Would easily recommend this eatery to anyone.< /review><user_id>112685894851655731114<//user_id><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

The food was just brilliant. We took the Seafood Spaghetti, the Octopus Salad, and the Lamb Wrap, and everything was delicious. The Octopus Salad we asked to change the salad from Arugula to Green, and it was accommodated. The place is clean, tastefully decorated, and our waiter was friendly and felt authentic. Given the many dining options in Carmel, it would be a shame to go back to this place next time we visit, instead of exploring other places, but it was so good I'm tempted.</text>

MY REVIEW IS FOR ARTEMIS NOT VILLA SOMBREROS! So sorry it closed! A very special friend came into town over Mother’s Day weekend. She loves “great” restaurants and is always telling of new places she finds in Sacramento. We decided to try Artemis on Ocean Avenue. We had the very best dinner there. She had the filet mignon and told me it was cooked to perfection. It melted in her mouth like butter. I had the salmon with fresh vegetables and fingerling potatoes. Excellent! We were both sharing our dishes with each other. It was so good that we went back the next night to have dinner again. You won’t be disappointed. Mark was our waiter and took good care of us! We look forward to returning to this new gem of a restaurant in Carmel!!! So sorry they closed Artemis! ☹️<//review>

<Review>Me and my girlfriend are here and they have the best chicken and quesadillas.  This looked like a new place and was glad I came by.  The guac is to die for and the service by the staff is great.  It's a little more expensive than some of the other Mexican restaurants but definitely worth the money.< /Review><Rating>5</Rating>< resp>

Was hoping for so much more especially for the location. The restaurant is fairly small. We were 1 of maybe 3 tables being occupied at the time. There was one server. We went during lunch time. I placed my order with the server which she repeated to me incorrectly. I corrected her. Several minutes later she returned to confirm our orders having us realize the kitchen hadn't even started firing it up yet. She once again tried to confirm an incorrect order. She was corrected again, twice, because I was getting worried. When our food arrived it was completely wrong and exactly how she had been erroneously trying to confirm prior. She told me just to eat around what I didn't order and a separate plate was brought out with the correct sides. I ordered an iced tea and was told there was not enough left. She had stated she would bring their pozole soup for my daughter but never did and had to be reminded when the food arrived. The food was bland and there was a spice, perhaps cinnamon or nutmeg, that was very overwhelming. Such a disappointing experience. We will not return and do not expect for it to last long in Carmel if experiences like ours are the norm. Price for 2 item combo was close to $20 per plate. The positive, rice was decent and cooked well.</Text>

Food was okay, the enchiladas were covered in a sauce far too sweet for the dish a typical Americanized take on Mexican food. The salsa and guacamole was delicious however. The main problem here is the service. We had to ask four times for more chips and they finally arrived right as we were leaving. The waiter also was telling a table waiting for us that we were taking long and apologized for the wait. At that point we had been trying to get a check to leave for quite literally 20 minutes. We finally had to go up to the bar and wait for a check there so we wouldn't be late meeting some friends.<//Text>

<Review>Wow. I usually don't leave bad reviews instead I just don't review it. If you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing. But I am making an exception to this place. I don't know were the high star reviews came from. We were looking for a place to eat after a morning at the beach with the family, and saw the high star reviews and decided to try it. It was a very bad experience. Despite there being only two tables of less than three people and us a party of six with three front house people everything took forever. While we waited to order after having asked for drinks, two other tables came in and left after minutes of just sitting. First red flag. There was a couple sitting next to us that appeared to have finished their queso fundido long ago, when their food arrived. The gentleman just had a bite of his beef tacos and stopped eating, although his companion just stuck to finishing the plate quickly - we at the time assumed he didn't have a big appetite. Second red flag. By this time we had waited 10 minutes to order after having gotten our aguas frescas. The menu items looked promising albeit pricey for common Mexican food -not high dinning. As soon as we ordered the couple next to us asked for their check, it took 15 minutes for the check to arrive, by then we knew we had made a mistake to stick around. We waited 45 for our food and even asked since the other table had just recieved theirs. As soon as we asked about the delay our food started to come in person by person. First dish on the table were the chicken taquitos. The chicken mole taquitos were cold, the sauce watery, and the chicken in them barely had any mole we even asked what had happened to the mole -in their defense they brought us a side of mole. Minutes later, the Guadalajara tacos  made their appearance on the table. The meat was over cooked and didn't taste like Mexican seasoning, although the presentation was great and portions were a decent size. However, the biggest faux paus was that the tortillas for the tacos took minutes to arrive so rice and beans were eaten first. We had asked for three orders of tacos  but only got tortillas for two orders so one person had to wait extra time. When we asked about the whereabouts of the third order we were told they were out. And we had to wait for more to be made. Lastly the mole came in, which was watery and tasted store bought only enhanced with a stick of cinnamon in the process. The meal was overpriced for the quality and time we waited, around 20 dollars per plate. I have had better tasting, authentic, and faster Mexican food out of food trucks in Oakland or San Francisco for half the price. During the entire time we never got asked for a refill on our drinks and we dared not asked for fear of waiting 15 minutes for it. I am a person who has been around the restaurant business for decades, and do not mind the wait or price if service and food are of quality. However, this place didn't have the service or quality. The only thing I can say is that the presentation of some of their plates is great, and their tortillas are hand made and good quality. As we were leaving the lady who makes the tortillas set up shop and was making the tortillas to the public by the window. It was cool to see that and that is why I give them a star.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I’m Mexican American and my taste of food is quite of special and I’m not proud of it is just my taste  likes only certain flavors (when is Mexican cuisine) that relate to my memories, and this place has a great flavor, excellent quality and sophisticated but welcoming environment, I went early around 1145 and the gentleman who took our order was kind, respectful and proud of the food, give us an explanation on any question we made. Looove it!< /Review>

<Review>Amazing deco, authentic Turkish fare, a delightful and eager-to-please host.( added bonus of a very clean well maintained washroom)
Must try lamb shanks - delightfully soft and flavorful
Reservations are better as is the case with most restaurants in the area, especially on weekends.
All in all, I loved the place and would definitely recommend!< /Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Local refined in its simplicity. Excellent food, interesting wine list. The price is high compared to the type of cuisine but in line with similar Carmel restaurants. Excellent service. Overall an experience that I would do with pleasure.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Nice place, excellent service, tasty food. We were offered an option off the menu and it was a pleasant surprise. Lamb shank with onion and carrot seasoning with pilaf rice. I recommend!

(Translated by Google) Excellent food and lovely staff. I was wrong and I tipped a $ 100 bill when I wanted to drop a $ 10 bill and they ran me over to the sidewalk to return it to me. But honesty is just an unexpected addition to a wonderful dining experience that is more than worth a try. Also prices are very affordable for what is Carmel by the Sea. Highly recommended.

(Original)
Excelente comida y personal encantador. Me equivoque y deje de propina un billete de 100 dólares cuando queria dejar uno de 10 y me corrieron a la acera para devolvermelo. Pero la honestidad es solo un aditamento inesperado, a una experiencia gastronómica maravillosa que justifica sobradamente probarlo. Ademas los precios son muy acomodados para lo que es Carmel by the Sea. Muy recomendable.</Review>

One of the best Taco Bell’s I have ever been to! I was super hungry and they didn’t disappoint. Great customer service and they have a bunch of value items that are well worth it. Got a Beefy Fritos Burrito for $1 and that thing was packed! They’re super generous on their portions.< /text>

I can never rate fast food higher than a four. So many times your order is wrong. They seemed offended when I asked questions when it was done... they had a sense of pride for filling it correctly, which they did! Service was fast. Order filled correctly, even with changes I requested. Never the best food but for fast food we occasionally like taco bell. Had taco salad, tacos, fries, nachos, and more. Establishment was clean. Staff was kind.</Review>

I have been going to this Taco Bell since it opened, but less frequently over the last year or so due to the quality of the food. But the last 2 drive thru visits have done it for me. Both times they have left portions of my order out and I was home before it was discovered. Maybe I should have checked the order, but I didn't order alot. I shouldn't have to plan for incompetent employees and I didn't have to years ago.</text>

How do I state this kindly..."no bueno." What happened to fast food at taco bell? Lack of care in assembling food to go? Lack of work ethics just for a pay check? Really? Stay away and spend alittle more  money to go somewhere else. 😝.<//Text>

Always good food and service here.  Gave 4 stars because most times I try to order the frozen drinks either the flavor I want is not available or not ready or there are none available at all. When I can get a frozen drink they are really good.<//review>

< Review>
Taco Bell offers a vegetarian menu as well as the ever popular $1.00 tacos and under $1 menu.  Great choice for healthy inexpensive lunch or snack. Also they now accept Google Pay and Samsung Pay.  They participate in GrubHub delivery as well. They had clean dining area and friendly service.</Review>

She apparently couldn't understand what nachos I was wanting either, and we settled on just the standard nachos and my casadillas. Seemed like she didn't enjoy being there, but my food was brought out quickly and tasted as good as I thought it would. Maybe I just came on a bad night?<//Text>< response>

<Review>Taco Bell is a value priced product. I can feed the family of a 4 for 25 dollars. The food appeals to the kids and is palatable for adults. in recent years have experimented with some some very peculiar flavors like adding Dorito flavored chips to the taco shell. The kids seem to like it but it doesn't seem to appeal to adult taste< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>They are very fast and NEVER mess up my food, which is extremely important to me. I do not eat beef and I can substitute any meat for beans and I never get even a single bit of meat in it (which regular restaurants fail almost every time). It may be a basic fast food restaurant but for vegetarians on the go it can be a life saver.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>It's Taco Bell what can I say. Staff are alright and service is very quick. Food is best described as faux Mexican, but nobody comes here for the authentic experience. Food tastes great, I personally get the beef quesorito every time. Drink selection is great if you like mountain dew, not really outstanding for anything else. Overall, I will go here for a quick bite to eat or for hanging out with friends.</text>< Pics>

It seems to be random how much stuff they put into your food items. One burrito might be packed and then you get a taco with like three pieces of cheese, a pinch of lettuce and a tablespoon of meat. I like to get the $5 cravings box which is a good value.</Review>

An OK restaurant when you need something really fast. Taco Bell is pretty dependible and this place meet all the expectations of a franchise.<//review>

<Review>Nacho tortilla chips were SWEET...tasted just like cinnamon sugar. Nasty combo when mixed with nacho cheese sauce. Someone probably re-fired the cinnamon sugar twists to crisp them up...or the oil is old. Not funny because it was hella gross and I was starving getting off my night shift. :/< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I placed an order and asked my daughter to pick it up in store. They didn't want to give it to her after even talking with them over the phone. They insisted that my phone must be in vicinity for them to charge me. I decided to cancel it, but after 2 days they charged my account. They lied to me and caused me inconvenvience and frustration dealing with their stupid service. You need to retrain your manager not to make up rules and read your FAQs!< /text>< Rate>

<Review>My wife ordered two beef burritos, one was ok the other had no meat or sour cream in it.  She also ordered a chalupa but it was not in the bag when she got home.  Checked the receipt and they charged her for it but it was not given to her.  Three soft tacos and none of them were the same.  Meat and cheese in one, meat and lettuce in another and the third meat, cheese and tomatoes.  So these people get paid more now  but don't have the brains to make a taco or fill an order.  Needless to say I will never go there again or have anything nice to say about them.  And I was being generous with one star.< /Review>< resp>

One of the best Taco Bells I've been to.  My food was fresh and didn't look like it had been smash flat.</Review>

< Review>
WORST TACO BELL!!!! Horrible customer service, will charge you a different price then listed and when you point it out they tell you the sign is wrong.  If they mess up on your order and you tell them your missing something or something isn't what you ordered they are rude.<//Review>

Our visit here for Valentine's Day was perfect! This place looks like it came straight from 17th Century France but the interior is new and incredibly clean. The staff was awesome and kind -- the food was great, and I found that we derived a lot of value for what we paid. I plan to come back here every few months during COVID as a nice getaway from home. Highly recommend this charming place!<//Text>

This hotel is adorable! We stayed here for our anniversary. Although built recently, the hotel is decorated with antiques and authentic pieces that the owner has collected over the years. We received wine and a cheese plate upon arrival, and loved enjoying breakfast outdoors with made-to-order hot food! Although expensive, would definitely recommend. :)< /Review>

The staff was so kind at check-in and even wrote me a hand written note welcoming me back since my last stay. The hotel staff provides you with 2 complimentary glasses of wine and a lovely cheese plate. The rooms are adorably decorated and so is the lobby! I’d recommend Hotel Enchantè to anyone.<//review>

It had substantially deteriorated in the 7 intervening years since I was there.  I was not going to spend the second night at that place.  Found the Enchante Hotel on line and booked it on Expedia.  Really nice hotel.  A little more expensive than the first hotel I was at, but it was not out of range for Silicon Valley hotels.  Attractive, newer property.  I understand the owner lives on site and her pride in the hotel shows through.  The complimentary charcuterie and cheese plate and wine during the afternoon was quite nice, as was the selection of breakfast items.  Only a couple of minor negatives: be careful on the bathroom floors.  Marble floors are attractive but slick when wet!  Also, watch your shins, because the metal bed frames are unforgiving.  But I would definitely stay there again.  I hope I have the opportunity to do so.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808fb0eef2c5b1e1:0x8d8c9e31ca041a4< /gmap_id></record>

Charming little hotel with rather tight rooms and appropriate period decor. Seemed a little odd given how spacious some of the restrooms are...

Even the bar/restaurant is small. But the location, if you're visiting or attending an event in downtown Los Altos, is impossible to beat.<//text>

Stayed 6 nights here. Staff is really friendly, and the complementary breakfast is made to order and undoubtedly the best complementary breakfast experiences I've experienced to date. Note that you will be doing street parking, which has a 2 to 3 hour limit during the hours of 8/9am - 6pm, but the hotel will provide all-day passes if requested. Overall a great stay!</review>

Was here at the hotel for the day preparing for a wedding as a bridesmaid. The rooms are beautifully decorated with large comfortable furniture and is very picturesque. The building itself is very cute and the staff seemed helpful as well. Not sure what it's like as an overnight guest but it looked like a really cute place to stay if you're in the area!< /review>

Beautifully done.. Super comfortable quaint location conveniently located in down town Los Altos. Room are smallish but complete and very enchanting.  Well appionted and smell great.. Fun for a quick bite to eat and glass of wine if you live close by.. Also live music on some nights!! Very cool find!</Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Enchante is my new go-to romantic getaway hotel!  I've stayed there twice now, and I have to say that their fantastic staff is matched by a truly charming and comfortable facility.  We are welcomed with a smile any time of day or night (along with our pets, whom they have considered as well).  Each room at Enchante is themed: Apothique, Marie Antoinette, and Amerique are a few.  Guests are treated to a complimentary charcuterie plate in the evening, and a breakfast each morning.  When I made a booking error, the staff bent over backwards to accommodate me for an additional night... for which I will be eternally grateful!

Whether you're in town for business or just a vacation in the South Bay/South Peninsula, Enchante is a worthy choice.  Downtown Los Altos is just steps away, with so many choices for food and entertainment that you would never need to stray far.  Cupertino is home to one of the largest Taiwanese communities outside Taiwan so it's an excellent base camp if you're looking for a weekend of comfort food.

Parking can be tricky on busy weekends, and the occasional Street Festival blocks off the road - so be sure to check with the hotel before parking your car for the night.< /Text>< name>

We had the opportunity to stay after my husband's Military Change of Command Ceremony from Fort Hunter Liggett.

Above & Beyond in friendly, professional  service, thoughtful amenities coupled with stylish parisian accommodations.

Our trip was both delightful and a memorable experience in the Françoise Grand Suite.

Top Notch Service by Josh S. General Manager & Abby A. Enchante Boutique Hotel Owner.

Merci etc a bientot!

This downtown Los Altos boutique hotel caters to a high-end clientele. The restaurant, Campagne One Main, serves small plates and offers a limited menu of wines, beers, and non-alcoholic beverages. The outdoor patio is lovely, but it's proximity to two busy streets makes it loud and frankly, dangerous. The ownership comes off as elitist- beware service may be poor if you are not a local or established community member.<//text>

The line was not moving at all. I don't know if there was something technically wrong with their equipment but my experience today was not pleasant. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt I can't base my one time experience here with how this coffee shop is ran. I'm sure this place runs great when there's no hiccups.< /Review>

Nice place on your way to Tahoe. Take care as this location is closed and drive thru is allowed. You cannot go in and order.<//Review>

<Text>Slowest service is ever. Starbucks severely understaffed this huge, high volume store located at a major junction for Tahoe and  between CA & NV.
No sense of urgency in staff. Wait was over 30 minutes total after ordering ahead on mobile app, and then waiting in store with many others.
Drive thru and store were both long waits.
Drink was not even well made compared to other Starbucks. Orders were wrong for other people.<//Text>< Pics>

This is my favorite Starbucks because it use to be a burger king and when I was a kid our school bus would actually take us here for some unexplained reason, this sealing a love for the King and his burgers. Fast forward a decade and there I was as a young adult and it had become a cheesesteak shop, the sandwiches were delicious but the big secret was the amazing Mexican food the nice older gals in back would wip up if you knew how to ask, yet it went out of business, dark times indeed.

Skip forward another few years and this guy Bill who while super nice was clearly on some sorta drugs you would buy at a party in sun valley stole the menu from T's Rotisserie in a incline village. This was hilarious to me because the recipies were actually from the family of a man named Sergio whom Bill was also able to steal from T's. I dont know this T person but they were probably upset at this whole situation. Anyway they gave away free food their first day open and I ate 8 burritos. Swear to God, EIGHT over a 10 hour period. We had been lifted from the dark times of no great food next to the mousehole. After what seems like 5 years those party drugs seemed to have done their job and the thousand yard stares from the Bill's Rotisserie senior employees had gotten too consistent. Their talented chef left and opened Golden Rotisserie a few blocks away and sealed this weird buildings fate to be empty again. It was empty and grossly neglected looking for a while. Picture homeless meth heads and bears staying away. Imagine how that feels to see a childhood friend who became a lifelong presence existing like this.

Finally, Starbucks, came to the rescue and remodeled this place into what's now a rather nice location. I was able to convince a girl to move here from another state for this location and my dog so you will have a hard time convincing me it's not the best, highest rated Starbucks in the world, actually. Halle is my favorite barista, she makes the chocolate milk with half coconut milk and it will blow your mind.

A lot of cops hang out here, I dont have a problem with this but you might, man.

Fyi, I dont even like Starbucks or coffee in general so I would imagine if you got this far into my review and are into coffee you will be well served by visiting.</text>

Normally this place is ok...definitely better customer service than the other one by Safeway. But they need to update their hours or at least get it figured out with the app! I mobile ordered and paid thru the app only for my husband to get there and find out they are closed! It’s 8am on a Saturday morning ???   Seriously???? Now what do I do about already paying?!? Btw I just gave birth and really wanted my tea ☹️< /Text>

The interior strikes the perfect balance of Truckee log cabins and the urban coffee shop. The indoor/outdoor fire place is a huge hit. I’ll be forever disappointed whenever I walk into any other Starbucks.< /text>

It was bad enough that Bill's closed down; those burritos were amazing.  Opening yet another Starbucks when there's already one in easy walking distance - not including the one in Safeway - just adds insult to injury.  Truckee doesn't need two Starbucks within half a mile of each other.

Starbucks' coffee is overpriced trash anyway; Wild Cherries and Dark Horse are way better.  Go there instead of giving your money to this monstrosity.< /Review>

< Review>
I had this issue with waiting 30 minutes for my drink. I went up and asked about fifteen minutes into waiting, and she asked the girl and she nodded yes so I thought that meant it was coming up. Idk some miscommunication happened I guess and it resulted in me waiting a while. but they refunded me which was really sweet and most places dont really care. The manager noticed and I thought it was kind that they cared and gave me the drink for free so I'm happy. :}< /Review>

<review>Usually a pretty reliable stop for me to and from work, but this past month I either get burnt-tasting coffee, cold "hot" drinks or just an all around incorrect order. I usually go through the drive-thru so it's not like I'm going to turn around and request a new drink once I'm miles down the road.< /review><GmapID>0x809bde4af46a7587:0xaea7668a12e5b0a7< /GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

I had a couple bad experiences here, but today was different. It is 1:15pm, went through the drive thru, and was greeted by a very friendly, bubbly, competent female. She also offered both of my dogs pupachinos (whipped cream in a cup) which was very sweet. Even though there is whipped cream throughout my car, it was worth it. Thank you to the drive thru worker today. Made my day a bit brighter.<//Review>

My drink tasted ok but they didn't fill it up all the way. I had the top inch and a half of my cup empty! I ordered a venti but ended up with a grande's worth of drink. It was a rip off.</Review>

Definitely recommend to go check this place out< /text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Fresh, made to order mexican snacks. We had fresas con crema (fresh strawberries & cream - yogurt/condensed milk mixture) and a Bionico (fresh fruit salad with the same mixture from the strawberries and cream, granola, raisins and fresh shredded coconut) Service was fast, friendly and moderately priced. I'll be returning to try some of their fresh pressed juice mixtures, they have energy boosters, high blood pressure mixtures, fat burners, weight loss and many more.< /Review>< pictures>

Monday morning made a reservation for pick up truck on Wednesday. I got there at 8am on Wednesday, traffic and raining day took one hour drive to get there. When I went to the office the guy said”sorry, no trucks available, only have 26’ truck” I don’t need that big truck in the city and pay more. The office open at 7am, they have enough time to call me and let me know no trucks available before  I got there.....In fact, I am not sure they really “don’t have a truck available for me “ or they rent the truck to someone else......just make the excuse........ not guaranteed to get a truck is ok, also they are inconsiderate to not give a call before customer to get there if not available... waste the time and bad customer service .<//Review>< username>

Very unreliable.Reserved the 16' box truck one day before online with confirmation number.next day about to pick up the truck,they called and was told no truck available. That massed up my whole days schedule.Rather go with budget next time,a little bit more expensive,but you don't get surprised.< /text>

Two out of the three my girls and I stayed there all night..we did not have the need to go explore other spots because of how much fun we were having with the mariachi and how amazing the hospitality is with the servers and bartenders is. Definitely recommend checking this place out. Don't be scared of the small menu the food does the talking,so flavorful! I've tried the taco platter, flautas, chorizo dip and quesabirrias. So good. Don't forget to also get the bartender tequila flight. It won't disappoint. Also,  Marachi accepts cash only.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVuYiCfCv8FCldhANOGkYGFiI2KQotw7dE0TVs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4lcp_Hc6Ua6a_IAHSj7rcw2e11YBofNaV0SZL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808561330a6423db:0xb1ad87c127d03f0a</GmapID></record>

At 1.40am the owner charged me $50 a buck of 6 beers when I I paid $41. I asked why....he thought I was drunk I wasn't. I was ready to call the policy but I was loud he gave back $10. I have to fought for it.!!!

<Review>First time we go to this place and we had a bad experience.  the food good, but the customer service from the waiter man (the youngest waiter) super bad.  the waiter man approached and told us that we had to leave because the table was only for 1 hour and a half, that after that time the customer has to leave the table.  we were surprised that we were having a good time and was consuming a lot.  he brought us the bill and it was $ 427 us, you can see that in the 2 hours we were there, we consumed a lot.  We told him why we have to go if we are buying a lot and the very rude man told us that it had already been 2 hours and that we had to go.  Then we spoke with another female waitress and she told us that it was not true that the other male waiter could not tell us that it was a lack of respect on his part.  We asked to speak to the manager and he apologized for this, he told us that we could stay without a problem, but the truth is that we were already upset about that and we finished the drinks we had and left.  when we left we realized that the waiter man took us out of there because he wanted to seat a group of his friends.  This waiter man is very disrespectful with the customers, the truth is, I don't know how he is working in this place but he respects the customer.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Was excited to try this place, the drinks looked great on the website and the patio looked cute when walking down locust. So we decided to give it a try.

We ordered two drinks, a pour of tremana reposado tequila and a margarita. We wanted to order the mole for dinner but they were out. So we ordered some tacos. The drinks took about 25mins and the margarita's rim was covered in iodized table salt, this was definitely a first for us. I guess they never heard of margarita salt. The tequila was in a shot glass with a big slice of lime.

The food was good but not good enough to warrant another visit. Service was spotty but they staff was friendly. I feel like they are very new to mexican food and drinks so I'll just make it as a tried but won't return</Text>

<text>I love this Mexican restaurant! Delicious food and very original presentation of the dishes. They've opened just recently, but I believe that they will make it soon to the top 5 restaurants in Walnut Creek. Very friendly staff! We had tacos de octopus, mahi al pastor and choriqueso. Delicious! Outside seating is very comfortable. Highly recommended.< /text>< userid>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The attention of the staff that works in this bar is terrible, the bartender takes a long time to offer you a drink and it takes a long time to deliver it and the worst it takes longer to charge you, since you give him the card and he starts talking with people , instead of charging you

(Original)
Es pesima la atención del personal que labora en este bar, el cantinero se tarda mucho en ofrecerte una bebida y se tarda  mucho en entregarla y lo peor se tarda más en cobrarte, ya que le entregas la tarjeta y se pone a platicar con la gente, en vez de cobrarte<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Called in to schedule a appointment they told me 1:30pm, showed up on time and waited for the barber to finish cutting his current customers hair. He finished at 2:00 pm and i thought i was next but there was another customer ahead of me. Oh well, try the other chop shop in bellflower the only thing their chopping in this one is your patience and time.< /Text>

<Review>This is a great place to get a haircut. Everyone has their own opinion and which they're entitled to but this place definitely is to spot to have your haircut by barbers who still believe in quality haircuts. Yesterday I had my haircut by Brian and he did an exceptional job period prior to that I had been here two more times and have been cut by two different other barbers. My first time the barber sitting on the third chair did a very well job which led me back for my second visit. On my second visit the haircut was pretty decent which was cut by The Barber on the fourth chair closest to the rear parking lot. My overall opinion on this Barber Shop is 5 out of 5. Don't be afraid or intimidated go ahead and try it out.<//Review>< UserId.>

<text>Run!!! Save your self!
When I walked in there was no one at the front. I accidentally found the two barbers in the back parking lot smoking weed. I should have use my common sense but allowed him to cut my hair anyways because I was in a hurry.  The barber cut me and gave me a rash with his clipper.</text><Response>None<//Response><Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Abel Alvarez<//username>< gmap_id>

<Review>We had never parked down by the airport but were pleasantly surprised at how easy and quick it was. They were very professional, our driver was very friendly and talked to us in the short shuttle ride over and made us feel comfortable. It was only a few minute wait for the shuttle and we had no issues at all. I have no complaints! Would definitely use them again :-)< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>-awesome experience

-cool drivers and nice drivers form my experience.

I will park here from now on rather than the other Co. I used.

Call when you grab your bags and you're over at the Courtesy Van Pillar/waiting areas across the street from the airport arrival area.

Getting to the airport was fine but returning was a disaster!!! After we arrived back into San Diego and got to the pickup location we contacted your service via text message. At that time it was us and one other couple. After 15 minutes went by I contacted you by phone and was told a van should be there shortly. After 25 minutes other people began to show up. At the 35 minute mark a van finally showed up but there was about 30 people waiting and the van can only fit about 10 to 12 from the looks of it. We gave the driver our bags and he loaded them. As we go to get in the van there is no spot left for us. The driver then tells us that there will be another van coming soon and trys to leave with our luggage. We ended up have to take a taxi back to your parking garage. Very disappointed since we had waited the longest and were left to wait. I won't be utilizing your services in the future nor will I recommend you to anyone!</Text>

Mike our driver was great. I gave him a hard time (jokingly) and he rolled with the jabs like a champ. Very cordial and friendly and the music he had on made you want to dance. Great experience on the way to the airport.</review>

I had to leave unexpectedly to care for my dying mother. My partner came a  week later fearing the end was near. After a week she was rallying but still on home hospice. The car  was parked and paid for one week. When mom's condition changed we had a friend pick up the car for us to stop incurring charges. We called WP to inform them of our circumstances and they wouldn't allow us to extend our parking time so we had a friend pick our car up. Well WP charged us the full rate instead of the government rate when our friend picked up the car.

I can't understand the inhumane attitude of this business.

Will never use them again.

<Text>Our drop off experience was fine.  Our pickup on return from our trip was not. I texted, called and then had to call again...the manager on duty on 11-19-2020, at 7:35 p.m. in San Diego "yelled" at me for not texting...hmmm...I said "sorry, I did text and have the reply to my text that says to call if no pickup within 15 minutes"...he then yelled at me again, telling me to give the driver time to arrive, and hung up on me...he called back in apx 3 min apologizing to the max "Yes you did text"...our total wait was almost 30 minutes....Wally Park just lost a customer...forever.<//Text>< pics>

We were very pleasantly surprised at how great this experience was. They were very efficient and got us to and from the airport quickly. The car was in a covered garage so it wasn’t dirty when we got back. The drivers and other staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I will never use this long term parking again. When I was dropped off three days ago, the driver gave me a card and told me I was going to be picked up at same place. All I had to do was to call or text.
The number to call is automated voice and one can not talk to a person. The number to text is also automated and gives you same answer each time you text. What a frustration!
I sat waiving each shuttle that passed and I was not been picked up. Finally a lady dropped off some one and I started to put my bags in and she asked me what was I doing. No matter all my explanation, she said I had to move to a different location!
It did not matter I told her I was there for almost one hour, she asked me to move to another location to be picked up.
All they need to update is their instructions in their cards they give to their customer at the time of dropping off. Change you automated answering and texting service.
Better luck to you.<//Review>< Pics>

Steve drove us back and it was bumpiest hottest ride in the west! Two of us got sick, and each van has to stop, driver needs to get half way out and swipe a card to get in and out of their own garage.  They have the gate readers but haven’t invested in the openers for the vans.  👎👎👎<//Review>

<Text>Convenient access from 5 South in particular. Covered parking and not horridly expensive. One of the better options since SAN turned the economy lot (by the rental center) into employee parking. Vans/transport are a little old and run down but they have a LOT of them. Pick up is fast either arriving or departing.< /Text></record>

<Text>Parking at the airport is never fun, but they make it as painless as possible. The drivers were very helpful in providing extra service for my mom and her wheelchair. We booked online through one of the parking apps and only had to present our printout upon entering and again upon exiting. You want to make sure you keep that in a safe place where are you can find it easily</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

Good reasonable option for long term parking at the SD airport. Offers valet and self park. Also has mostly covered parking which is nice and rare for the price. All the employees were helpful. I would definitely park there again in the future.<//Text>

<Review>Got there.. family member is disabled. Parked in handicap space and was told I wouldn't be charged premium prices for the  only handicap parking space. ( on another note.. When I got into their van cut my leg on a sharp piece of metal on the door. )
Three days later when I picked up my car, they charged me premium prices and told me I was in a covered handicap space (when it's the only handicap space they had) and it was an extra $40 for the premium parking spot.. " the handicapped parking spot". It's not just the $40 its the fact that they lied to me and they are  scamming people for being disabled. They tell you one thing and do another... I'm never going to use their facility again.<//Review>< Time>

Parked here for a short trip to Cabo. Indoor parking, shuttle right to airport, good experience going to airport. When we came back a few days later we got right on the Wallypark shuttle, the driver was friendly and took us right to our car, dropped us off and left with the other passengers. To our surprise, apparently we left an inside light on in our car for the 5 days we were gone so the battery was dead as a door nail. I was thinking oh boy, now I get to call AAA and it will be 30 minutes at least before they would be there. At that time the shuttle driver was going back by, we asked if he had jumper cables, he said no but they have a portable booster and he would get someone to assist us. Within 5 minutes a nice young lady came walking up with a jumper box, hooked it all up and we were able to start our car. What could have been a real pain, turned out to be a great experience. Heck, they even offered us bottles of water on the way out. Nothing but good to say about Wallypark SD and all the employees we dealt with. Thank you.<//review>

I went to the store got there at 730pm and was asked by Miguel (an older gentleman) if I needed help. I let him know I needed to upgrade one of the lines and he told me I needed to make an appointment or get curb side pick up since they are closing. I asked him if he can check if they have the iPhone 12 Pro silver 128Gb in stock. He said he didn’t want to check to go through the website because he didn’t want to go to the back to check. Horrible customer service. I’ve been a customer for more than 10 years. He was very rude and was mumbling something to the other employee next to him as I was walking out.</text>

I had a pleasant experience bringing over my family to Verizon.  I had been hopping around from carrier to carrier and finally found Verizon to give me the most bang for my buck.  I started with myself, then ported my family's 4 lines.  The process was easy and Xuan made the transfer a delight.  She stayed with us even after the store closed its doors just so that we were clear about everything regarding our new Verizon service.  She is really knowledgeable and definitely made this headache into a seamless process for my family.  Thank Xuan!<//Text>

Very knowledgeable and attentive staff.  To be honest, I probably would have dropped Verizon as my service if not for my continued association with this location.  I am a corporate customer and that is my retail outlet of choice.  I am not normally a fan of going in a mall for business however, it's a non issue there.  The location is very close to an entrance and I have never waited more than a few minutes.  Conversely, I've waited well over an hour several times in stand alone stores.</Review>

Went here to buy a phone with the intention of gifting it as a present for someone. I asked one of the sales person that if I buy the phone and service all at once, could I switch carriers. The sales person insured me I could. Come to find out now the phone is useless and when I returned to ask questions on what’s going on... no one could help me. I did not appreciate getting scammed as I did</Review>

<review>Went into the store at 10:30 to purchase two Galaxy 7s.  Gave the guy my name and phone number.  Was told their would be a short wait as one other person was being helped.  Meanwhile  a small group of purchasing customers gathered behind me.  At 11:30 the same customer before me was still being helped, the guy was still taking names and numbers, and I was done patiently waiting.  I left went over to Costco, were I received excellent customer service?  I bought the same phone and Verizon plan.  Walked out within a half an hour.  Do yourself a favor, don't shop Verizon at the Montebello Mall.</review>< Pictures>

<text>Staff were Great very friendly,  extremely helpful
I need to point our Michael especially. He was Amazing Helpful, especially as in the beginning I was a little upset with transferring from ATT after 17 plus years and felt misinformed about the their plans, that being said Michael gave me Great advice and on three separate occasions,  Really helped me, Actually did me a huge favour never complaining and always patient and Super helpful,  I wish I would of purchased my phones from him original so he would of made the commsions
This guy went above and beyond in customer service, and gave me great advice and help,
And not making any commsions never passed me on Always willing to HELP !

I highly recommend Michael, (Mike)

As I am a VP of sales my self at a Solar Company,  I am happy to respond to inquiries about him, This is a Real Review, my name John
Almasy

<Text>Great customer service at this location! After a really bad experience at the Pasadena off Lake location in which they tried to get me to buy a new phone with no effort to try and fix the problem I took my phone here. Myate or "Mya" as they call her was so helpful and knowlegeable. She simply reset my phone and the problem resolved! She also gave me reliable information about purchasing the phone I want when it comes out and even preordering. Will be buying my phones and accessories here from now on after years of going to Pasadena location. Hope the customer service stays amazing!</Text>< gmapID>

<Name>David Angel</Name><Time>1419106109065</Time><rating>1<//rating><text>I dont understand. the company i work for, have 6lines with sprint. My son wants an iphone, so we go to verizon and they told me they dont have that phone on their section of prepaid phones. Ok I said so what are your plans and how do they work?? Mr samuel the guy who took care of me explain to me that if I need a phone is
better to go over a contract and save money?
Sounded good to me,. Total phone price $$$$ and my credit sucks :( woow. Ok next step? Well
$400dlls deposit and we will move on,. I looked
at my son 10years old and he smiled at me. I
said ok so if I move my line and my number to
you guys be my provider is gonna be two lines
and I want my number to be with you guys, he
said yes. Ok lets do it! Total $$ $400dlls deposit
cash and your phone will be $99dlls and then
your son another $99dlls and you guys gonna
pay $180dlls a month for both of the lines and
gonna have a good plan. Well my son was
extremely happy! The guy samuel arredondo goes inside and comes out saying sr, mr del
Angel Verizon is asking me for another $400dlls
deposit for your account!!!! Excuse me???? He
goes, yes I understand but I just got in to a fight
with them cause I dont think is fear. I said I
know they are crazy!!!! I said lets cancel
everything.... he calls her superviser named
alejandra Larios and told me straight up if you
cancel you will be receiving your refund in the
next 15days! Im like whattt??? But if I just pay
you guys.... how would that be!!!!!
Now I was already happy to have their service but seems that something went extremely bad...... honestly I think some one from the very top should read my complaint. .. the store was full of people waiting to be new clients and a lot of them saw me pissed of. Right after I got my contract on my hands I step out and they didnt care at all losing a client, not knowing I call my boss asking him to transfer our 6accounts to verizon. I think Verizon is a very good company
And they need better and more responsible people working for them. I hope I get all my money back, I work for a big law firm and i think you guys Verizon executives need to read this. I honestly apologize if I did something wrong but another companies next to yours are getting all of your clients thanks to your personal. I feel like you guys dont care about clients at all, and I feel that my money is on their hands not knowing how much every single penny counts right now on this economy! Even my son said to me. Dad whats gonna happened to our money? I said oh well now we have to let know their supervisors. ...<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The worst. I would go here out of convenience and after going to another store closer to work found out I was being overcharged for years. My same plan  should have been $40 less. Another time I tried to set up a new phone on my line and was told it would cost $50 more - they brought out that stupid placemat with the prices and circled numbers and wouldn't explain what the "other tax" they wrote in was. I called the store closer to work and they were saying I was being overcharged. The employee shrugged and I left. The past times when I confronted them about being overcharged they never know how to respond. Stay away.<//text>

<review>Employees are mostly very friendly. Kim is always great and professional and quick. I gave a 3 because there have been about 5-6 times in the last month that the drive thru has been closed for business due to some issue with registers or something. I have witnessed dozens upon dozens of cars come and go because it was down. Lost revenue big time! And business taken elsewhere like Burger King or other coffee shops. It would be nice to  have dependable service for less inconvenience. Thank you<//review>< Pics>

Honestly, McDonald's is McDonald's. But we waited at east 15 min for our food bc of "door dash orders" and when we got our food it was cold and the employee was wearing a yellow mesh mask. Trash. No responsibility in the safety of your customers. Im absolutely appalled and she is lucky I didnt open my mouth in person.< /review>

I ordered a large Oreo Mc.flurry, and what I got was the smallest Mc.Furry I have ever seen! It wasn't even filled up all the way. The quality, and appropriate serving sizes should accommodate for the "lack of large cups." DO NOT GET A MC.FLURRY FROM THIS MC.DONALDS! Extremely unsatisfied customer!

What a surprise!  They had dog biscuits for our sweet canine companions at the drive through window.  That puts them in a class of their own.<//review>

Hit and miss with speedy service. They do their best. Would like to see the speed of service and not be parked when ordering.</Review>

Extremely slow drive thru.  Like another reviewer said, waited 30 minutes in the drive thru just to place my order, no joke. Food is typical.  I would avoid in the future< /Review>

Love their Hashbrowns. I always get at least 5 of them whenever I go. However their drive thru lines are atrociously long. Usually not worth the wait if there's a long line.</Review>

We went through the drive through. It took us an hour to get our food! The chicken on the sandwich was burned, and there was nothing else on the bun except a stack of five pickle slices. All food was marginal.</Review>

Observed two managers Cory and Jacob deny service to two different customers without masks who were trying to cover their faces with their own clothing. Yet did not deny access to another man without a mask and instead offered him one to conduct his business. Is McDonald's picking and choosing who to provide masks to? This looked so discriminatory to me and my family. We were also treated poorly by both managers but I don't want to take away from the real problem here.<//text>

<review>Went here a few days ago and got breakfast and asked for two Iced Caramel Mochas of which I had a coupon for a free Mocha.  When the woman came to the window she gave us two Iced coffee looking drinks, so I said "These are not Iced Caramel Mochas.  Where is the cream and caramel?"  She said the are, and they do not come with cream and caramel. I told her they do so she went off and put cream and caramel on the top.  We drove off and tasted them and they were horrible iced coffee that she just put cream and caramel on, so it got thrown away.  Then when my son looked at the receipt as I drove, he said she charged us for the two Iced Caramel Mochas,  but did not give us the free one which she scanned the code.  So nearly $9 thrown away.   Apparently they do not have a clue what the heck they are doing.</review>< Date>

The fries were hot!!!!  The customer service was great.  I ordered a Crispy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich and got a McChicken sandwich big difference in coating and price.  What a rip off.  The quarter pounder with cheese deluxe didn't have all of its items on the burger.  It  had one slice of cheese, NO ONIONS, a sliver of lettuce and a couple tomatoes!  The fries were hot which is a plus however the oil they were fried in was old tasting and had a very weird after taste.  After spending the amount of money we did and knowing we didn't get the items we paid for it makes you wonder.  We are from out of town and the drive back to fix the order would have been long!  We won't be back and it was a lesson learned.  Make sure you check your order BEFORE leaving.  I am still wondering when McDonalds is actually going to do what the commercial states!  NOTHING is fresh made to order when you order it!<//text>

Some of the female employees are very inappropriate and disrespectful, although I did find a couple employees that have nothing but great reviews and should be awarded for the hard work and respect that they show!<//Text>

I think I really liked this place but I will no longer be going here as they have gotten cheap with sauces. They only give one sauce for six chicken nuggets. I go out of my way to go to restaurants that are not stingy and this is now one of those to avoid.<//Text>

Wouldn't use our own cups for coffee and when we asked for senior price we were told only a small cup, no refill. The coffee was not up to par either. The good thing was it was hot.< /Review>

TERRIBLE FOOD! Ordered two burritos, a hash brown, and two cheeseburgers with only ketchup and cheese. What we got was a fish sandwich, no hashbrown, and two cheeseburgers with everything on it and so much extra ketchup that the patty was sogged through. Tried to scrap everything off of them but they were soggy and tasted like they were left out for a week. WILL NEVER GO BACK</Review>

<Review>Haven't been to McDonald's in a while but the wife wanted a fillet of fish. That alone was almost $5 and it was about half the size it used to be. I got a big Mac meal and the bill was $18.03. For another $5 we could of gone to the Chart Room and both got the best fish and chips around with more food than you can eat. Don't think I be back to Micky D's except in desperation. Too many good places to eat for way less. I guess that's why there were only two other people eating at the tables.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Try to stay away from this place if you can. Dirty would be complimenting this place. One employee standing by door smoking and spitting on sidewalk. Two employees at the other door smoking and swearing. Everything was dirty. This is a picture of a garbage can by the sitting area. DISGUSTING in everyway! Everyone who worked here who wasn't outside smoking behaved like they were mad at the customer. I did not hear one person say thank you. If my husband wasn't desperate for a cup of coffee we would not have stayed.</Text>

First off, Crescent City is the most beautiful little town on the coast that you could find. While on a business trip I always stop by this McDonald's for breakfast and they are always busy. With that said, just because they are busy does not mean that they lack in customer service in expediting orders and getting people in and out as quickly as possible never rushing anyone. I've had nothing but great experiences going there. My food is always hot, my order is always accurate and the the ladies and gentleman at the front front counter always have a smile and a warm welcome waiting for me. I know this is hard work so I really appreciate the fact that I can go in and be treated like I'm a neighbor or a friend and still get a great dining experience. This cannot be said about all McDonald's which is why this one is so rare. I hope that one day everybody gets a chance to have a dining experience such as I have had at this McDonald's in Crescent City every time I go. Thanks again you guys the team McDonald's Crescent City rocks!< /review>

Nuggets tasted old, the ¼ pounder was hot but chewy. I've had much better out of the same restaurant. I guess the quality if the food is dependent on the standard of quality of the crew working that particular shift. Friendly faces at 11:30 am  on a wednesday. But the food was not so friendly</text>

<Review>Owner only cares about his Brookings restaurant. I don’t know why the corporation hasn’t closed the Crescent City McDonald’s down. Poor  and rude service, cold fries, burnt eggs, no ice or carbonation in soda, over stuffed bags, dirty bathrooms, non-paying customers hangout, upside down fries in bag and they always forget an item you purchased while in drive-throu, I almost forgot the 15 plus minutes wait in drive-throu. Years back the kids and I use to enjoy coming here.<//Review>< user_id>

There was no one in front of us and it was 9:45 so I don’t know why it would take that long. They also refused to use my app coupon (that would save $3) because they already used one of their other promotions that only saved us $0.30.

Slow service but friendly.
Prices of course are great its McDonalds cheapest place to probably get a gut ache but is sure tasty.
Have a small dessert selection again its McDonald's. I love getting fries and a vanilla ice cream cone to dip them in .</review>

Heading home Monday evening after Thanksgiving, stopped for a burger, had to wait by the drive thru order board several minutes and the guy kept keying the mic., which he probably does often to relieve boredom. Messing with customers for fun and entertainment. Called him on it at the window and he lied about the weather causing the interference. Told him it wasn't my first rodeo and I'm familiar with the sound of a mic. being keyed. Arrogance isn't a virtue kid. Got to the outtake window, and an unpleasant young lady handed me the bag. The bacon cheeseburger and fries had definitely been sitting more than would be considered acceptable, but I was so hungry I just choked them down and chalked it up to "Never the McDonalds in Crescent City again", to many other superior fast food choices to be subjected to that nonsense and crummy food.</text>

Upon entering the McDonald's, I was greeted by Amy, a friendly person, who acknowledged me and then the other person at the counter assumed the duties of taking my order. As usual, it was clean but busy. My order came quickly and I found a seat in the rear of the dining area. The chicken sandwich was good and cooked and presented well.</Review>

I'd say most of the time I've had a very pleasant experience but tonight for some reason they just could not or would not correct a very small issue with the temperature of a cheese burger. The burger was cold and didn't even melt the cheese it was so cold. So I returnded it to be warmed up and they gave me another cold burger! I didn't even bother informing them the second time< /text>

<Text>Was looking where I wrote my comment.

This restaurant was very clean. The employees were kind, smiling, & presentable. By that I mean their clothes were clean, shirts tucked in, hair neat. These things make a big difference.  One of our burgers was made wrong. Ordered no mayo & oops! mayo. No problem. Took it back & they are making it again. Not scraping the mayo off...re-making the sandwich.  That's how it should be. All done with a smile.
Thank you. Also, thanks to the manager & other employees here. Working with the public isn't always easy. Working "fast food" can be challenging. These folks did excellent.
True that, Maryellen Stoner ☮<//Text>< pics>

We ate one of the new burgers - it was delicious! Not a traditional McDonald's menu item. Price was higher but so was the size and quality. I'm not normally a fan of McDonald's, but menu items like this may change my mind!< /Text>

I stopped here for iced tea passing through town.  It looks like it was recently remodeled, but it felt a little dirty.<//review>

< Review>
I want to put 2 stars but just can't:  bathrooms always kinda dirty; have waited 10/15 minutes with a line of people waiting to order, with no one at all manning register. Pretty unbelievable. They do not give reciepts but I've been asked point blank if I paid for a coffee when I asked for a refill. Man. Not ok. . . Different employee, I think her name is Verona?(short, older thick hips, pig tails), when I got to register to order, she looked me up and down and barked "were you in LINE??". . . I was stunned. "I am in line" is all I said. She kept a nasty look on her face just staring me down. What in the world? Then finally, rudely, asked what I wanted, as if I was wasting her time delaying my order. (I am not kidding, or exaggerating). The person behind me was standing well behind me, looking as stunned as I. Turns out several folks I know have been verbally accosted by this employee. When I told this story, they all knew exactly who it was. (Unbelievable, that, really.) Another employee told me she is OFTEN like this with customers, but VERY different when management is in front. Ugh. . . . All that said,  seniors get .25¢ break on coffee price but unlike everyone else, get small only, and not choice of size like everyone else(at THIS location only, per my experience). . . No more wifi either at McD's. So. . . .When I found myself dreading going near the counter, wondering what abuse or insults I'd have to suffer, I just stopped going. Ths is NOT how I intend to start my morning! . . Conversely, BK always has clean bathrooms, very sweet and sunny employees, good, cheap coffee, and wifi. Nuff said.< /Review>

<review>While I was present, a oerson had a seizure.  Three employees handled that emergency like pros and also with deep kindness, offering comfort as well as first aid.  They had taken the time at  some earlier point to know this person by name.  I was so deeply impressed by the entire team's poise and kindness.</review>< Gmap_id>

False advertising, wrong pricing, horrible attitude. The manager was absolutely rude. I wouldn't mind paying a bit extra, even a 50% markup but the manager was rude and condescending about it. If she can't do her job to update the POP then she shouldn't be a manager.

Advertised $1 coffee and it is now 1.50 served with a frown.< /review>

McDonald's is McDonald's.  However,  every time I go in there the bathrooms are out of toilet seat covers. And the floor is gross.

They do a ok job of keeping the lobby clean. They are good at keeping tables clean. And they are all pretty friendly.<//Review>

<Review>Poorly managed. Over 8 staff, at 11 am had over 10 customers waiting by the counter while several staff stood around doing nothing. Five customers had to take their receipts back to the cashier and request their orders after waiting for more than 10 minutes. :(. Not the quick stop you expect a McDonald's to be.<//Review><Name>Mariko Cronin< /Name><user_id>101742291196798665943< /user_id><rating>1<//rating>< gmapID>

It was a McDonald's... They were understaffed and trying to figure out how to keep service moving. The food was fine, but took longer than expected to get.<//Text>

<Review>The total bill for breakfast was more than $13. I have eaten lunch at KFC for less than $8 for two people. I asked for an orange juice and she automatically wrong up the biggest size. I had no idea it came in different sizes. I only go to McDonald's once a year when my wife incests. Then they didn't deliver the orange juice or an extra coffee I had to re explain what I ordered. And the hashbrowns tasted like they use rancid oil. One good thing when we got into the car I told my wife now I don't have to come back here for another year.</Review><pics>None< /pics><rating>1< /rating>< Time>

Every parking spot had a dish tray in it. Was forced to park away from building. Then when I went inside was asked to move my car by a semi truck driver right after getting my food. The McDonald’s employee offered to hold my food but guess what... I’m a customer in your store and this was a terrible experience. I don’t want cold food and we all know that if I don’t eat this food right away then it’s pretty much  Un-eatable.<//review>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>Okay, you can never expect a McDonald's to actually be good, but it was one of the highest rated restaurants in the town. Most others averaged 2 stars, while this averaged 3.7. This may have been the worst McDonald's I've ever stepped foot in. The bathrooms had such a foul stench that my entire family was turned away. It took far too long to get three quarter pounders. A man wearing a pirate hat was seated at the table next to us. A huge group of punk teenagers came in and started blasting loud rap music. The food wasn't even hot. Please avoid eating at this McDonald's or even anywhere in Crescent City at all.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>It's MacD's yeah sure it's all processed food and bad for you... But it's got a flavor all of its own that is delicious damn near addicting.  I'm giving it a three for inflated pricing however and not having any dollar items on dollar menu.</review>< pictures>

It took over 10min to make a sandwich, and this is not a first time.  And when I came home and looked at the sandwich, it looked wrong, like maybe someone messed with the sauce.  🤧 so it went into trash.  Poor service and maybe someone spit on my food.   Never going there again.</text>

Far beyond the word dirty for the bathroom. It was disgusting. I saw it after I ate but if I would have seen it before I ate, well I would not have placed an order for anything. Clearly you can tell they don't stay sterile and are not one bit on code for health concerns. After the meal within half an hour 2 of us 3 got ill with their stomach. I will never ever go there again.<//Review>

<Review>They have the worst customer service I've ever seen. To call this place fast food is ridiculous 13 minutes is what I sat in the Drive-Thru waiting for them to complete two orders. There's no smiles, I see the manager Rene cursing at an employee from the outside of the drive-thru window while she's smoking a cigarette very unprofessional.<//Review>< Pictures>

😊Brookings; 5 🌟 cleanliness, 4 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food (which is good for McDonald's)
😁Crescent City;  5 🌟 cleanliness, 5 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food
😊Eureka (North) 5🌟 cleanliness, 4 🌟 friendliness, 4 🌟 food
👎Eureka (South, with PlaySpace) 2 🌟 cleanliness, 3 🌟 friendliness, ? food [(we got drinks and left, I ended up with the runs: you may make whatever assumptions you desire.) We will not be back at this location.]< /review>

Mayor McCheese was helping Big Bird at the Fry Guy's station when I walked by and Henrietta Hippo yelled, "Tarnation!"  I jumped, and turning quickly on my heels, I caught sight of The Professor and MaryAnne kissing in the corner.

Just joking.  McKee Dee's was great!</review>

<text>Food was nasty cold and greasy, the floors stunk and need to be swept, my double cheeseburger only had one slice of cheese, I called the manager and she said I was lying about it and to get over it. Mostly all the employees are rude, (especially Cody miles) the bathrooms probably haven't been cleaned in a year. Toilet was dirty mirror had prints all over it, there was no tp, tables need wiped, and for whatever reason when I want to go thru the drive thru they have a bunch of their employees standing by the menu hanging out. It's is outrageous, I'd never come to this location. Not a good or sanitary McDonald in my opinion.<//text>< Pictures>

Been in the good industry a long time. Drive thru servicr is very quick, little or few errors and pleasant. Food is what you expect from a McDonalds. But what sets thrm apart from any other McDonalds, fast food places or eben most restaurants is, the cleanest bathrooms i have come across at any of these places. Well done. Keep up the great cleanliness and friendly service.< /Review>

Never again ever in C.C...The food servers do things to others food they don't like saw it one day so never again even though this used to be my favorite place to eat I'd rather drive 20 miles to Brookings than eat at this one.  Managers use to sell drugs out of drive thru from what I hear you still can order drugs from drive thru, just order a specific child's meal. Corrected for my mistake I mixed up Burger King with you. I apologize<//review>

<review>This location was severely understaffed for breakfast.  8 cars in the drive thru so we walked in to order.  Line to the door. After ordering, took about 15 minutes to receive our 3 breakfast meals. Slow service, no smiles.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
