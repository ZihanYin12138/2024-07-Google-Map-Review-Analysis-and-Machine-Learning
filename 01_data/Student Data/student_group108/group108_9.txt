< review>
It is a dive bar, so don't assume it's anything other than a dive bar. The bartenders are very friendly and nice. They are quick and if they can, will always say a warm hello at the door. There is always someone busing the tables of empty glasses. They check IDs on everyone, so just take it as a compliment. There's plenty of security so I don't feel like scared or nervous of the clientele. All the patrons for the most part are just there to have fun and dance. DJ Greg is awesome. He plays all genres of music, so it can be country, hip hop, 80's, heavy metal all in one spin. So it keeps it interesting and gives you opportunity to take breaks when you don't like a song, but plenty of dancing because he's plays really great songs. But it's a good mixture of young and old. It's free and totally worth it on Friday nights.< /review>

<review>I haven't going to this place for at least 30 years are longer it's always good time.   The live music they pic is always incredible they always manage to bring in a good man every time they kill it. I also have multiple friends that go there and can go there by myself and feel safe and just dance my butt off to the music the staff is polite security makes sure there are no problems it is very packed there all the time.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This is one interesting place but I will tell you this and listen very carefully beware of the bathroom it is very small and it is very dirty it’s kind of like the women that run around that place small and dirty if you’re looking to get hepatitis then you need to visit the bathroom it is filthy.<//text>

This is your neighborhood dive bar that's lots of fun. The drinks are priced right and there's almost always a DJ in the evening. The venue has plenty of security. The dance floor is small, but you can always find a place to show your dance steps.<//Text>

Don't go here for karaoke as you have to be part of the inside group to get up. Then they want you to pay 5 dollars to get up then say you never paid after you did. Seriously don't go there on Thursday for karaoke.<//text>

The night before heading back to Chicago we stop to have a drink. From the bartender to the people at the bar everyone greeted us with open arms - felt like we've been coming to Mabel's for years.

Daniel's company is by far one of the most honest and best costumer service out there. From the receptionist that answer the phone the first time I contact them, she was friendly and really helpful. They reach out to me supper fast, and were hands on right away. My first appointment was really easy to set up, Daniel was flexible with the time and date I provided. Not to mention he really cares about his costumers, and we will be in contact with you, whenever you have a question. Not to mention he always gives out an update text, to let you know he's on his way to your home. Which I found really convenient. He has an awesome personality, and will explain in detail how he will be executing his plan to solve your problem. We had a rodent problem and after 3 weeks later our house is rodent free. I will definitely be using his services in the future. Totally recommend !<//review>

<text>Daniel is the man!
He is very professional, punctual, and above all else is very outstanding!
First he came and took care of my roof rat problem.
i also asked about doing a spray for insects and since he a was already doing me 1 service he gave me a pretty sweet discount.
during the whole time he was here he was explaining all the chemicals he was using and the best part was they were pet friendly. after he left the next day I found a ton of dead bugs mainly pincher bugs which amazed me how good his product actually worked! Daniel has a great personality and he loves dogs! He asked if he could take a picture with my brand new Belgian Malinois
check them out!< /text>< Pics>

<time>1614399707406< /time><text>Searched for this company before moving into a new place. The landlord was using another company and couldn't seem to get rid of them! Found this company by a quick internet search. Outstanding pest solutions had the best reviews on yelp and google!! Not only were they quick, they were also thorough!! The complete interaction was perfect from start to finish. From the young lady who answered the phone, to the owner, and finally the gentleman who showed up and provided the service. It has been just over a month and I haven't seen any bugs (dead or alive) in a few weeks!! Great company with great service. I definitely recommend them to take care of your bug needs. Thanks again Outstanding Pest Solutions!!</text>< Response>

Outstanding is the right name. This company is truly outstanding. From the first contact with customer service to the owner to the tech, everyone is very professional and so friendly. Their communication is awesome. They keep you informed of everything they are doing and contact you to confirm appointments
Last week I had a scheduled appt and they contacted me the day before  to let me know it was going to rain and I couldn't get the best benefit from the service. They set another appt  for when the weather was better. That is what I call customer service,  That shows real consideration when they check the weather the day before your appt. Daniel was great when I first called evaluating what we needed. I had called around to a few other companies but it was Daniel's personally and affordable prices that made me call back and I'm so glad I did.  He sent Adrian out to be our personal tech, we have the same tech each time  and he has provided us with great service. He is always on time,  texting when he is on his way,  he is knowledgeable, courteous and very friendly.  This company definitely gets a two thumbs up  !!!

My house had a couple different spiders including black widows. Daniel eliminates them all. He comes routinely. U can tell he loves his job. Takes great pride. Which means great service for me. Everything he uses is safe bc I have  10 month old and pregnant with the second. Check him out! Thanks Daniel<//review>

<review>What can I say about Outstanding Pest Solutions. I had a different company come to my house and spray for spiders. That company  sprayed my house and did absolutely nothing to rid my house of spiders. I called OPS and spoke with Daniel. I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give OPS a chance. Daniel and one of his service professionals showed up to my and did a AWESOME AWESOME job of ridding me of the spiders. It's been 2 months since OPS treated my home and to date I haven't seen not a spider. Along with his SUPERB care of my home Daniel also gave me a great educational lesson on spiders and other creatures that inhabits my area.

If you're thinking about using Outstanding Pest Solutions you don't need to call anyone else.... I PROMISE YOU BE HAPPY AND SATISFIED WITH HIS AMAXING SERVICES!!!! To top it all off OPS take care of your home for low low cheap prices!!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The service is great. I like that they text the day before to remind me of my appointment. Adrian always texts when he is on his way. He's always very prompt, friendly, and thorough. The ants are terrible this year so this has really helped. And no more black widows.</text>

I move to Moreno Valley on May 2020 and everything was good into every morning I wake up with cockroaches almost everywhere I even find one in my bed and let’s not talk about the back yard. I call outstanding pest solution and problem solve I did see only one cockroach death the next morning but that was it. Outside I only see death cockroaches and their service is outstanding, Adrian is really friendly and professional I highly recommend their service.</Text>

<text>I contacted Outstanding Pest Solutions because I had a very bad infestation of Earwigs. Since the first time Adrian applied pest control and removal of wasp nest and spider webs a few months back I have not had any pest problems. I like that there’s no contract and every three months I receive a text reminder if I need for them to come out. Adrian is courtesy, friendly, professional and always very pleasant I enjoy his outstanding personality!!!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

We live on a 1/2 acre lot surround with tons of vegetation (weeds) which is the ideal environment for earwigs. I was actually losing my mind killing upwards of 10 a night INSIDE my house and literally hundreds outside at any given time. I contacted Daniel with Outstanding Pest Solutions out of sheer desperation.

* RESULTS: Immediate results. Earwigs (and all other bugs) virtually disappeared. I've literally found 1-2 inside the house a month (versus the 10 a day I was finding prior). For weeks afterward we found PILES of dead bugs who couldn't get into the house past the pesticide barrier. Five weeks later, still NO earwigs. He just came back for maintenance.

* PROFESSIONAL: Prompt and friendly customer service. Answers calls and texts immediately in between jobs, but stays off his phone while he's on site (very professional). Texts to confirm days before, 24 hours and when he's on the way. Wore shoe covers inside our home and a mask.

* QUALITY SERVICE: Extremely thorough. Takes his time to spray every inch of the property. No entryway into the house was left untouched. Also spider and wasps nests removal included in service.

* SAFE : Provides a list of chemicals (amounts) used. Very knowledgeable and explained all materials used to make me feel very safe having dogs. Provided license number.

* Fairly priced. No pressure to pay for a particular schedule/frequency.<//text>

He put my mind at ease with the information he provided, he is professional, reliable and very a happy person!. He and his partner were already waiting when i got home.

<review>I want to thank Daniel James of Outstanding Pest Solutions for his pest control services of my house. Last summer was the first time we were ant free! He also eliminated spiders and pantry mosquitoes. Give him a call before the warm weather season brings in all the little critters! No monthly contract!</review><date>1587244796412<//date>< user>

I reached out to Outstanding Pest Solutions and Daniel responded almost immediately. He was able to fit me in quickly and was very communicative in calling the day before to confirm the appointment. He didn't give me a large window like a lot of places do - he provided a specific time (noon) and texted about thirty minutes before arrival to keep me updated. He was efficient while here and did more than I expected. I had asked about the earwigs but he also removed spider webs and wasps nests that I didn't even know I had. If you're looking for a friendly effective pest control company Outstanding Pest Solutions is who you should hire.< /review>< date>

Daniel is the best!!!. I can’t say enough about him as a professional individual who loves his job. He comes to the door in uniform, excited with a big smile.  He listens to my concerns and he explains things clearly. He knows his stuff and his experience shows. He does my house and my parents’ and I’m always going to refer him to anyone who is looking for a pest control guy. He does such good work, takes his time and completes the  job!! No short cuts. Daniel deserves his 5 stars ⭐️ and more! Thanks Daniel.< /Text>

<text>This morning I contacted Outstanding Pest Solutions, Daniel was very nice and friendly, he explained the services he offered, I was Pleased because this is what I was looking for, Daniel came to my home, he explained the type of chemicals he would be using for exterior and interior of my home. Daniel is Knowledgeable about his work. I recommend Outstanding Pest Solutions to everyone looking for Pest Control...by the way I only had to pay for services today which was 69 dollars, I thought I was suppose to pay for services today plus the bi-monthly payment, Daniel said No you only pay the 69 dollars and in two months you'll pay the bi-monthly payment. How Awesome is that!!!! Outstanding Pest Solutions is the way to go!!!< /text>< Pics>

There service I received from David was so impeccable! He was very informative and helpful in regards of the bug problem I was having. The best part is the price was reasonable and he was able to come out within an hour after speaking with me! It’s a huge relief because it was invasion of the bugs.</Text>

I don’t usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to do so because of how awesome Daniel was! Not only did he really take his time in getting the inside and outside of my home sprayed, but he was extremely positive and pleasant. You can’t beat his prices either! Recommending to all who need pest control!</review>

Had Daniel out today to help with our pest problems. He was extremely professional and knowledgeable. After giving us they help we needed, the change around the house was night and day. We could go outside without being attacked by anything and everything. Thank you so much! Will definitely recommend and have him back in the future.< /Text>

This is the best pest control company around. Daniel came out and he is by far the best at what he does. He is passionate with pest control and probably loves his job a little too much but that's ok with me and for any customer who hires him too. Daniel, if you read this review I want you to know that my family and I appreciate you very much and we are happy with the service you provide. We will happily see you at the next monthly service. Thank you!< /text>

AMAZING!! He is super professional and REALLY nice! He arrived on time and his communication was excellent. He has been in the business for a long time, which shows as he is extremely knowledgeable! Also he was the only person that ever arrived with shoe covers out of respect of our house. You will not be disappointed!</text>

Daniel is very professional and knows his stuff.  I had been dealing with a house mouse for about 6 weeks I had called out another pest control company that did absolutely nothing to resolve the problem when I contacted Daniel he has gone above and beyond the Call of Duty. The mouse was caught after 1 week of Daniel setting up his traps. He deserves more than 5 star I give him 10 stars. Very happy and will always use this company for any of my pest needs

This company really lives up to their Name! I had been having issues for months with German roaches and the technician immediately provided results after the first visit. I felt like the other companies were giving me the run-around. But Outstanding Pest was honest and got the job done.

The customer service is great and pricing! I took advantage of the specials this month. Totally recommend this company!</Review>

<Review>The proprietor responded, conquered and destroyed the bedbugs chewing my face that were hindering my modeling career with Versace. He performed his duties with stratospherical professionalism! I am truely grateful.

<rate>5< /rate><Text>New to Moreno Valley and I am so glad I came across this company! Daniel is amazing and makes sure to explain everything that he will be doing. He was on time. I had a REALLY bad tick situation nothing like I had ever seen before when he came out and did his thing the difference was unbelievable there was still a few left (normal) taking into consideration how many I had he came back at no additional charge that same week I believe it was about two days after I called him. With an awesome attitude. After the 2nd time he sparred I have not seen one tick and it’s been a couple of weeks. Definitely recommend this company!</Text>< pics>

Daniel is my hero.  He got rid of the things I'm most scared of. I've been needing pest control for the things outside that come in and he had the solution.  Service was fast, friendly and efficient.< /Review>

<Text>The Salvation Army has been around since 1865. The organization has helped millions of individuals and families. They feed, clothe, shelter and provide numerous services to assist people to get back on their feet. They also provide religious services. Which is very much needed during this time and every time. If you can, donate food, clothing for adults and children. If you have never been to a Salvation Army organization, volunteer and see what is going on. We never know when we might need their services.</Text>< Date>

Have had nothing but problems recurving mail. After some time due to when I came by to get mail I was verbally accosted, ie elderly abuse since I am 68, to the point I really didn't want to go near that place.
As of yesterday, I was minus 19 items ordered from vendors on EBAY, another from World Radio lyd valued at $787.00.
Reported to the La county deputy Sheriff's office. #171. Ongoing investigation. I am out close to $4,000 in goods that they claim never arrived. EBAY is investigating to assure that they did arrive. Have contacted, many times by emails Mr. Humphrey and Maria Sanchez. With no answer.The investigating deputy implied they nothing more than Lying cheating crooks. Stay away<//Review>

<review>I have to give this place 5 stars my mother was in a big bind & they were supposed to pick up her stuff today but the truck broke down on the way to her house, when they called & told her that they couldn’t be their till next Friday I explained to Joshua the situation about her selling her house & that everything needs to be gone today he said he would talk to his supervisor to see what he can do well about an hour later he calls & said they will go & pick up the stuff (how awesome that was) but because we thought they wouldn’t be able to do anything we had already made other plans to just through it all away really sad because there was some pretty good stuff... I give them 5 stars because of of the outstanding customer service that Joshua provided to us... Thank you</review>< pics>

It is an awesome place to get a meal they offer lunch and dinner twice a week. The portions are generous you will definitely be full leaving here. The staff are very nice and helpful.😀<//Review>

I've never been late on my rent in 2.5 years and am in an emergency situation. I called this Salvation Army for help and was told, "I should have thought of that," in regard to not having summer employment and refused help. I make 18k a year. I've called more than dozens of other aid organizations and even though they couldnt help, not one person has said to me, "You should have thought of that." How very Christian.

<Review>I'm very disgusted with organizations like this and others the CEO of these organizations make over $200,000 a year yes it's a fact so does red Cross CEO and all the others they're up in the $300,000 range they're not really there for the people in need they're only there for people who donate and line their pockets for themselves they don't help the people 100% that need help and shelter in vouchers the gift two or three day old pizzas I wouldn't feed it to my dog they're hard as a rock while the CEO benefits from the donations the people who need help suffer still they don't provide Total Care for these people who need help they only help themselves I no longer donate to none of them anymore they're hypocrites they don't practice what they preach I need to use that money to build a homeless shelter Frozen the people that went out on the streets instead of lining their pockets with the money that's donated misuse of funds that's a fact shame on you salvation army you don't really care about people's needs or want to help them you're in it for yourselves put out very little help to help people just to make it look good I wonder how much money the government gives you taxe free< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

It's all about the money with them. I thought the Red Kettles at Christmas we're their money maker. Those things don't touch what they make off the homeless and hungry.</Review>

< review>
Harmony is a super nice facility, super clean, and the service is great! There was a plastic barrier between me & my nail tech, and I wasn’t close to any other customers.

The nail tech was gentle on my cuticles and gave me a great nail shape.

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with how my nails turned out. The biggest issue - the gel polish is SO thick, and unevenly applied, and clumpy. the pix capture the texture. I know multiple layers of polish are necessary for chrome but this result was v disappointing.

Smaller issues - The application was kind of messy so I left w nail polish all over the sides of my nails.  & I asked for a dark blue chrome look, but they turned out quite silver (different than the sample nail I picked).

and it was $50</review>

Update:
Brandon is still my go to and my nails look great. Full set acrylics, single gel polish, shimmer accent nail and single rose design was about $75 and both hands match. I always get compliments when my nails are done.

Had my acrylic nails with gel polish done here with Brandon. He did an amazing job. My coffin nails look amazing and I've gotten lots of compliments. We will see how long they last. So far its been one week and are still in great condition. Full set acrylics were $35. +$20 for single gel color. Designs are extra and price varies. I love their spa massage chairs too.</text>

Got my nails done here while visiting for a wedding since we were staying at a hotel nearby. They were incredibly efficient and gave me one of the best gel manicures I've ever had! Great attention to detail. The place is very tiny- just 4 chairs and they do your nails on a pillow on your lap. Highly recommend!<//Text>

Im always offered something to drink. Everyone is always so sweet and attentive. Checking in and checking out. I also appreciate how clean it is. That's actually what caught my attention when I first walked past Harmony. Thank you Kelly, Katie, Brandon, Kate, Joan,  honestly I can name everyone who works at Harmony, for always making my time there the best and making me feel welcome! And thank you Tracy for always giving me the prettiest lashes! I always get so many compliments on them, so thank you love! Its always so refreshing coming to Harmony.

Beginning with receptionist Joshua was extremely kind and attentive pairing me with a fabulous nail technician. Cindy is by far the best I've ever had with dipped nails. Harmony is my go to place!<//Review>

My favorite mani pedi place in CA bar none.  Always have a great experience here no matter how much time passes in between. The manicures last a long time and the treatments are great. I can even convince my husband to go here sometimes.<//Review>

<Text>They were very rough with me. The manicurist cut into my cuticle and carried on hoping I wouldn't notice, while the pedicurist hurriedly filed the tops of my toenails to the point of scratching my toe skin with the nail file. They used a nail file as a pumice on the bottom of my feet and now the texture is very scratchy a week later. And it was more expensive than my usual place. The actual application of nail polish was nice, therefore 3 stars. But won't be returning.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<text>The technicians were trying to get me to turn my massage chair off the entire duration of my pedicure until one of them physically came up and turned it. I came in specifically for the massage; if the chairs are noisy and bothersome to the workers maybe management should consider replacing the chairs.

As far as the pedicure goes, the bottom of my feet were scrubbed/buffed raw. Would recommend going elsewhere.</text>< Rating>

I was so blessed today to be on my way the the Korea Times Music Festival and get caught in an hour+ delay on Hwy 5. :D Instead of sitting in traffic, I decided to get my nails done and lucked into Harmony Nail & Threading!

My nail tech, Brandon, was more than I could have hoped for. He was friendly, polite, professional, and quick.

I will always stop here from now when I'm in town.< /review>

<text>I have trouble even giving this one star! My daughter and I had been coming here for over a year. The service was not always the best, but we overlooked it because it was convenient. We were established as regulars with appointments every two weeks, and usually saw the same manicurists. Suddenly, it became unbearable, we always had appointments due to our busy schedules--we would show up on time and either the person we were scheduled with was not there or no one wrote us down. On other occasions they would make one of us wait at least 30 to 40 minutes and then when that person finally helped us they would stop halfway through and go do a threading or waxing leaving us sitting there half done. This was not a one time occurrence, this happened on more than one occasion. Also, there is the insensitive, rough treatment; I don't know about you, but I like to relax while having a mani/pedi. They place the gel dryer on you lap and since the manicurist stays on one side, she forces you to pull your opposite arm over while you attempt to keep the dryer from sliding off your lap. I can't help but write this, because, as I said, we were regulars for over a year with appointments every two weeks and tipped very well. It befuddles me that they were okay with giving this type of service to anyone without even an apology. Absolutely, the worst service I have ever experienced!< /text>< pictures>

I couldve easily spent under $100 even w/ nice quality designs somewhere else. The only reason I stayed was because I paid for parking already & my original shop was too far for my circumstance.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

They gave him basic without his knowledge and didn't do anything for his white heads still present on his face. Accepted payment and result when it wasn't what he wanted. Basically wanted money to rush him out the door so beautician can squeeze in next appointment. Asked for refund and the technician threw a fit and screamed because she scammed him and didn't want to return the money. No longer get nails done at this location. Acrylic Nails chipped within first week and continued to fall off. Otherwise, eyelash technician is perfect. But nails and face.... Better service. Never scream at a customer. Never make a customer feel like that. Disrespectful.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>judgemental ppl run this establishment. speak badly in Vietnamese about every person they manicure to eachother while the client remains oblivious to such desegregation. be careful what u say, and who can speak your language when u say it</review><Rating>2</Rating>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Isha Milap</user_name><date>1525815301437<//date><rate>1<//rate><review>Horrible experience. I don't recommend this place. I got my gel nails for hands and delux pedicure done last week. I always make sure i get quality for the price that I pay for. I sat for my nails and the lady started doing my gel nails. She messed up one of my nails, tried correcting it with infinite coats - because of which she forgot to finish the other four nails. In 2-3 days, the nail color almost came off and the unfinished nails turned black. She forgot to put transparent coat in the end. Moreso,the pedicure lady hardly took 20min to complete the pedicure and literally gave no results. The cracks and dead skin still show on my heels. I paid 68 dollars for such bad service. ($30 gel nails+$38 delux pedicure). I've been to several good nail salons in Los Angeles but this personally has been a very bad experience. Really dissapointed!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

very hard to communicate. The short lady did not understand me so she messed up my nails that I had been trying to grow for 2 months. do not listen to the young lady thats the "translator" do not know if she told the short lady wrong instructions or did not even understand her own language. I was so mad that I had to leave and yet they still charged me even tho I was very unsatisfied.<//review>

Great prices, good clothing including name brands like Dickeys. Only problem I had is their exchange policy is 7 days for a cash refund. Up to 30 days for exchanges with receipt for store credit.<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>Typical Dickies/scrubs lower-end store where the shoes are wrapped in cellophane.  Prices are slightly higher than what you'd expect at a place like this, but you don't go to places like this with very high expectations.

I called before visiting to check stock for a specific style, size, and color item.  There was a bit of a language barrier, but the person on the phone was able to confirm that they had two of what I needed and agreed to set them aside.

When I visited the store the following day, it was difficult to tell who was an employee and who wasn't.  After finally finding someone, I ran into more communication issues.  After a couple of minutes and the assistance of another employee, the items were located and I purchased them.

I made the mistake of not inspecting the items (Dickies pants) before leaving the store, and unfortunately one of them was missing belt loops and improperly hemmed.   While this is clearly a manufacturer defect and not the fault of this store, I'm reticent to attempt a return after the communication issues I encountered originally.

While I would return in a pinch, this is a place I'd rather avoid.</review>< user_name>

Flat billed hats for 4.99 and the cheapest dickies in town. Been shopping here since before they changed the name. Like 15 years and it's a good spot for people trying to save money.< /Review>

<gmap_id>0x80dc73e27d026b0d:0x45bf603e0633fe73<//gmap_id><Review>So I've been giving this store 3 to 4 years of my business, every year I spend a good 3 to 4 hundred dollars buying shorts and shirts. Today I decided to walk there with my kids. Daughter took her bike and son took his scooter.  As i arrive, I was going to put my daughter's bike inside (tiny bike she's only 6). She got off of course and I was walking it in, but the lady who i think was the owner said I couldn't bring it in.  I tried pleading my case but she was not having it. Very simple I wasn't rude nor upset I just let her know that if that was the case I wouldn't be doing any business at her store.
Such a bummer to loose a customer who has been doing business with them for so many years over the fact that I wanted my daughter's bike safe. And if your wondering there was no bike racks to lock it up.</Review><Rating>2</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<rate>1</rate><review>Their returning policy is awful. I bought a board and grip today. Once I applied the grip and set up the board i quickly realized the board's shape was askewed. I then returned to the shape and asked to exchange the board. They told me they wouldn't allow me to do do because of very unnoticeable scratches and a smudge of dirt of which was easilly cleanable. I'm unsure if I am an unsatisfied customer because of their return policy or their poor quality skateboard products. I have never had a single problem purchasing a product. But today is my first attempt to return a product and it was horrible.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc73e27d026b0d:0x45bf603e0633fe73< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

HORRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE IN,
TO START  PARKING IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS, YOU HAVE TO PARK 2 MILES AWAY OR UP THE HILL. THEY HAVE RESERVED SPACE BUT FOR ONLY ONE CAR, TENANTS HAVE 5+ CARS PLUS A GARAGE WITH MORE CARS, THEY TAKE UP ALL NON RESERVED PARKING FOR THEMSLEVES. MAINTENANCE IS THE WORSE I HAVE EVER DELT WITH, HAVE TO FORCE THEM TO DO THIER OWN JOB. I WOULD NOT RECOMMOND LIVING HERE.</review>

<Text>After living here for a year, this is a very awful place to live. There is absolutely 0 parking. My car has been towed 4 times in less than a month. My apartment is full of rats. This is pretty bad and has been reported to corporate I have insisted the office people to come and fix it, but they keep ignoring you. When you go to their office they never open even though they are inside hiding. Just to fix a hole in my kitchen it took them 3 months. Also, there is a lot of vandalism with the cars. I would definitely not recommend this place to live especially if you have family.<//Text>< Pics>

Living here you can’t have 2 cars and no guest to park. All day the parking is bad. The spaces that you could use are still not available all day, other residents save spaces to switch cars out.Maintenance is bad. You either have to beg them to come or you gotta call them again to do it right. The Managers are also very sketchy with time knowing them. The present well at first but then when you have an issue or just need help they’re rude. They don’t help. You live here but it also feels like your very restricted to to act or feel like you do. Many times I say I live here why can’t I park, why can’t I use my essentials, why can’t I get a request for anything even a garage, because they’ll lie and BS you just to get back to their day.<//review>

Not a good place you would want to live in if you have more than one car, come home past 5, and like peace and quiet. With that being said parking is terrible and if you want to have guest over, good luck with that. I would recommend driving in late in the evening and seeing it for yourself.

They have gardeners that come in around 4x a week so you hear them working. Not great for people that want to sleep in or have young children that take naps throughout the day. Some days you hear an ice cream truck with an annoying ring to let you know they are there.

Besides that its okay I guess, some locations don't have sealed balconies but I would rather spend a little bit more and have something more convenient.<//review>

<review>Awful experiences.
Office never reply to the phone.
Parking no where to be found while living here. Got towed in front of my apartment because no one want to park 10minutes after a late night work! (Tow guy said it’s ok to park they bcus no red line, but the apartment said there’s one). Also got the parking tag from the apartment complex on my car.
The apartment not seems to care. Always said nothing we can do. Of courseif you’re lived here you should get used to it.
Maintenance took a decade to comes to fix stuffs. And when apply work order online they never look at it. What’s the point?</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We have been living in The Village for the past three years and have not had any major problems since. There have been many accommodations that I have requested from Robert and staff  to which they have responded to diligently. I commend them for addressing issues promptly and for seeing to it that maintenance of The Village exceeds expectations.< /Text>

<Text>While moving in there were A-1. They helped with every need and answered every question. They even fix every needed right away. You guys are the best and I would definitely recommend this apartment complex to everyone I know and don’t know if they’re looking for a beautiful apartment to live in with attentive and a caring staff.< /Text>< pictures>

I literally have to take a lyft to and from my car every morning and every night due to the lack of parking. All calls to management have been unanswered. They will give you an 80 dollar ticket if you park anywhere else. When I get home from work the only parking available is 1 mile away.<//review><resp>None<//resp><Rate>1<//Rate>< GmapID>

Where do I start. Do not expect to have parking ever. Some have to park a mile or two away from the apartments. Also expect for your car to be unreasonably towed.

Management do not care if the apartment is clean. Glass bottles and garbage left all over the ground for days. Questionable people live here selling drugs. Recently there was a shooting near the apartment RIGHT next to us.

If you need something fixed, don't expect for them to ever come at a timely fashion, actually expect them to make excuses to NOT come. They constantly go up on the rent mid lease.

The management is down right rude. They talk down to you and belittle you. They do not have respect for anyone who lives here. When you turn your rent in on time, they claim you turned it in late. When you bring it up to them, they claim that it's their word over yours.

I mean this in the most honest way. PLEASE do not let them bribe you into moving into this apartment. Do not be fooled by the little tour they give you and how they claim that they're going to do renovations soon. They're not.
You'll end up in a horrible lease that will charge you 4,000 to get out of.<//review>

I hate this place!!! Got my car towed twice! Only one parking! Have to park 1-2 miles away, no assigned parking, got my car broken into like 3 times in the passed year, they shot a sheriff here not that long ago, got my house broken into twice! Have a creepy stalker, stalk me and my child at my own home! Did not feel safe! I felt like I was in danger! I told the managers of my situation they cared less! I moved out as fast as I could after my lease was done! Worst place ever I give this place 0 stars! Beware<//text>

<rate>3< /rate><Review>Usually great service, and nice staff who are there to help you out.
But there is a guy with a beard up front who definitely needs to spend a few weeks (if not months) in customer service training. Extremely rude and dismissive, and treats you as if you’ve done a great wrong by going to the office to ask for more info/to put in work orders.
Everyone else I’ve seen there has been extremely nice and friendly. And has yet to disappoint me.<//Review>< pics>

Be careful living here--it's not a very nice neighborhood, but the apartments are not too expensive, and not too horrible. They are very basic, and come with everything that you would expect for this price. Do not expect to get your deposit back--this company is known for taking as much as possible and making tons of unexpected charges.</text>

The owners don't care about the tenants or upkeep if this place. Trash and potholes are everywhere. Since I have moved in; June, there has been no AC and only broken promises of fixing it. I would not recommend anyone living here.< /Text>

<Time>1463682316866<//Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Nasty place to live. Most of the tenants in low income units have pets like pit bulls or annoying dogs that bark constantly and they dont even pay deposit fees for them. The manager seems to not care. Even though as a business they are loosing money. A lot of gang activity. There is a lot of homeless living in the creek right behind the building, lots of drug peraphernallia around in the grass or beer bottles. There is like 6 to 7 people living in a 2 bedroom. Parking is not assigned so people fight for spots and the managers dont care. Cars get Towed. Managers favoritism some tenants. Do not recommend it. They actually need a New Management as of now.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

They dont do anything for the residents, theirs a gang living near by theirs always the scent of weed and have drug containment. They live Close to the village apartment office. This area to live isnt good. And the price is way to high. Not to mention being harrassed by men who live here. Men hitting on under age girls. I cant step out of this apartment with filthy men harassing. The office wont do anything at all not even kick them out even if there is violence. They just dont care.</review>

Since I have lived here I have had nothing but problems! Where do I begin from broken dryer, to bugs all over. I recently got bed bugs which I had new stuff from the moment I have lived here they said it was my fault. This place is a joke Melvin and Roberto are the two most rudest people I have ever met! There is trash everywhere I mean everywhere and I contantly see drug dealing going on. Parking is a mess and they don't care if you pay your rent on time. RUN DONT RENT HERE YOU WILL BE SORRY!<//text>

First time here and have to say very disappointed.
Elected to go with their top rated Ken’s Favorite.
First off - no pizza sauce???
Plenty of toppings but very uneven - mostly hamburger, could barely taste other ingredients. Speaking of which, mushrooms and onions were raw. Also no cheese was discovered. And finally, nobody, I mean nobody dices raw tomatoes on top of a pizza - and there were so many that I actually measured out 2 full cups on a med pizza.
Pizza is such and easy meal to prepare right and yet this place did everything to make it a really bad experience. Lots of really good pizza places in SLO - just not this one!< /Text>

{'time': 1619991191757, 'text': 'I appreciate your feedback as we are always looking to improve. You ordered a pizza with 11 ingredients other then the sauce and cheese. All ingredients are cooked in a brick oven at 550 degrees for about 10 minutes. We make everything in house like the sauce  the dough the sausage nothing is frozen and all veg are cut fresh daily. Again thank you for your feedback, maybe you should try a pizza with less toppings on it so you can enjoy the flavors you like not the kens favorite that we sell thousands of. Have a great day'}</Response>

The michaela pizza is quite dank. $40 for an xlarge with basically every topping you can imagine. It is a packed pizza that beats costco combo pizza. You also need to eat it with their homemade ranch sauce. 10/10 would get again< /Review>

Palo Mesa is probably the best pizza chain in the county. Great ingredients and good service. A little off the beaten path, ok way off the beaten path on what i like to call "very south" Higuera, this location has plenty of room for an outing for a bunch of friends with typical pizzeria decor.< /Text>

Really good vegitarian pizza.  Lots of toppings. In general the crust is kinda soft and not able to support all the toppings, but overall a really good pizza.< /Review>

Probably the best tasting pizza we have ever had. Even the crust was fabulous. The toppings are superb. This is a place we will crave.< /review>

< Review>
I have been going to North Bay Auto for decades. I keep going back because I completely trust them in every way. They are professional and very competent. Yesterday I bought tires from them and received the best price possible. In addition to installing them, they did a quick maintenance check and noticed an issue with my brakes that I had been ignoring for months. They also reinstalled a protective seal to the underbelly of my car with no charge to me. I feel very well taken care of and have complete confidence in them! They have taken care of the last four cars I have owned and I will always be faithful to them.</Review>

<pics>None</pics><review>From my call to make an appointment to picking up my car .  This place had me feeling good . Not once did I feel like I was getting any thing but the truth or felt like I was being sold on what my car needed . It was very clear and professional with no surprises. I’ll be making sure that Northbay automotive gets all of my future business when it comes to taking care of my vehicle.. I couldn’t be happier with them.
Thank you Don, for the great experience!!<//review><user>111272857663168101658<//user><name>john brenes</name><Gmap_id>0x8085b14d11fbed69:0x46a9324280619ac5</Gmap_id>< Response>

This is a place to go for my volvo s40.  Very kind and very honest. Great experience every time I have to do scheduled maintenance.  Give them a try and you weren't regret it< /Review>

I was bringing it in because my car was randomly overheating. The initial meet was very nice and I was excited to have my car worked on. I brought it in around 11 and did not hear anything back til around 4. When they called, they said they couldn’t find anything wrong with my car, said they would replace my thermostat for me. When I received my car back after spending $460, my check engine light was on, and the car was running unbelievably rough. A lot worse than it was when I brought it in. I immediately called and asked if I could come back in. They did not charge me for this which was nice. When I received the car this time around, the battery holders were just sitting on top of the battery, not holding anything in place, the coolant cap was not on, and it just felt like there was a lot of incompetency for $460. Not to mention, my car is still randomly overheating, so the initial problem is still a problem. I could have done all of this on my own, a lot better too, and really just feel let down as I was relying on using that car for the weekend.<//Review><Time>1614879556562<//Time>< user>

Northbay Automotive at 929 Petaluma Blvd S, Petaluma, CA 94952 has once again out did itself in service! My scheduled appointment worked around my activities with ease.
Don knows my vehicle and is always ready to give me outstanding service.
I dropped my vehicle off and before I walked home Don called to say the work was done.
Northbay Automotive is honest and trustworthy!

Northbay Automotive at 929 Petaluma Blvd S, Petaluma, CA 94952  Is a wonderful and trustworthy establishment.  Don has been my contact for many years for automobile service. Professional, efficient, honest, and genuinely good describe the folks at this shop.

Most recently, I had my truck in for service while I was out of town.  Don kept in contact with me throughout the day!  My truck was repaired under warranty and was made available upon my return after working hours.

Honesty and integrity is how I describe Northbay Auto. Don and staff do a yeoman's job!

Thank you for great service.

Post dated for service on 28 April 2020:

The team at Northbay Automotive is outstanding!
I called with an issue and Don told me to come right in. He would squeeze me in as soon as possible. How great is that! What fantastic customer service.
Everything was explained clearly including an estimate of time for completion.
John came right over to evaluate the issue and recommend parts to be ordered. This was an incredible use of time. John continued to complete other work while the parts were ordered and awaiting delivery.
A call to inform me that my truck was ready and no surprises in the cost.
I highly recommend Northbay Automotive!</text>< Pics>

<Review>This is the second time I've taken my sweetheart car( 2008 Volvo v70). To them. Made an appointment , they looked her over fixed what was wrong, and got her back to me.  I find them honest, trustworthy, easy to talk to, and not charging me for work that didn't need to be done. Being retired I will be using them for all of my car needs. TOP NOTCH!!!

<text>The car was towed in around noon and I was out of there by 3:30! The waiting room/office was the cleanest I've seen in just about any repair shop. The reading materials were varied and there were enough for multiple customers. They were also quite nice about accepting a check from me because my SSI check wasn't going to be deposited until late that night. And, if you're hungry, there's a very good diner next door that closes at 2pm.<//text>< response>

<Review>I brought a Tacoma in for a pre-purchase inspection and they were friendly and accommodating, but they did not catch several significant items. A slow leak in the valve cover should have been caught while inspecting the engine compartment and leaks in the rack and pinion
assembly should have been observed when inspecting the underside and  shocks and struts. I subsequently purchased the truck and paid significantly to have those items repaired.</Review>< gmap_id>

I had a check engine light on and the car was idling rough so I called Mike the night before and although he was very busy, he told me to bring it in the next day,  and he would have the mechanic get to it before end of day. He did and when I did pick it up, it was running fine.

I've been using these guys for 20 years and have always felt like my business was important to them and they did a consistently great job.

The independent service centers always have a higher bar to climb and Northbay does it very well.< /review>

Having your car break down while out of town is stressful but the staff at this shop made it as easy as possible. I got some good advice about driving there before I got there.
I arrived at about 2:30 and they had the problem diagnosed and fixed within 2 and 1/2 hours. I was expecting to have to leave my car overnight so I was really pleasantly surprised. I also received a AAA discount. The staff are very friendly and made me feel at ease.<//text>

<response>None< /response><text>I am a new customer of Northbay. My car was sluggish to start and the starter died. I dropped off the car during a Sunday after reviewing the location online, at which point my car died. The next morning, I called and was told I would have a diagnosis on the problem that afternoon.

I did not receive an estimate until four days later - a bad starter, at which I was quoted a price of $500 to fix. Upon reviewing repair pal, I found that a similarly priced starter replacement in the area was $300. When I brought this to the mechanic's attention, he pointed out the price of the starter, which was $279. Since I had little recourse to get the car back, I paid, but found that the same starter was priced at $60 after getting the car home. Upon further review of the estimate, I found that the price of the estimate had been revised from $237 to $500.

While the work done on the car was solid, I cannot condone the way they took advantage of my situation. I suggest that if you're a new customer, you stay away from this location.<//text><Date>1505428297584< /Date><UserId.>113550848959368071932<//UserId.><name>Dagan Rose-Stockwell</name><Rate>1<//Rate></record>

These guys are amazing; the mechanics are smart, the service desk is friendly, and all are fair and trustworthy.   They are upfront and honest, they will never, ever recommend something unnecessary, and you will never feel pressured in any way.   On top of all that, you won't find more reasonable prices anywhere.  There's no better repair shop in Petaluma.</Text>

Simply the best!  These guys are true locals, in that they give Petaluma the kind of old-town service our grandparents expected from their local mechanic.  They are knowledgeable, fast, affordable, and trust worthy.  They won't sell you something you don't need.  And the prices are so good that when I call to pay my bill (when picking up my car after hours), I sometimes forget to even ask for the total, because I know it will always be less than what I'm expecting.  They service all our vehicles, no matter what model or make, and we even buy our tires from them. Although a bit more expensive than Costco or Big O for tires, we go with Northbay because their service over the life of the tires will far exceed that of Costco, Big O, etc., and in the end is well worth the price.< /review>

Deja Vu!  While shopping, the tire pressure light came on, and worried us.  So it was off to trusted NorthBay  right away.  Sure enough a nail that would have destroyed the tire if we had waited.  Dismounted, plugged AND patched and back on the car in a matter of a half hour!  The very same thing that brought me here a dozen years ago for the first time, and made me a very loyal fan since!< /Text>

I recently relocated to the Corte Madera area for Employment purposes and did not have a vehicle. Northbay Automotive, not only worked within my budget, more importantly the Staff of Northbay Automotive had a Great looking Car for me. Now when its rains i no longer have to catch the bus. Today, Northbay Automotive has me riding in style with a 2013 Chevrolet Impala  that runs and Looks Fantastic. They even had a Loaner vehicle i drove to work for Two weeks until my vehicle was all set to go!!! Looking for a car but don't have the money and don't want to drive some beater around? Contact Northbay Automotive THEY WILL HELP YOU RIDE WITH A SMILE!

<text>We needed our air conditioning fixed, and Northbay made an appointment the same day.  They gave us a quote and then called with a cost of the repair so we knew what to expect.  Their customer service was very good... professional, kind and prompt.  I would heartily recommend them to anyone needed prompt work on their car.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I've been a customer of Northbay Automotive for 20 years, with 4 different vehicles (Saturn, Subaru, another Saturn, and Prius) over that time. From basic service and tires to diagnosis and repair of tricky intermittent problems, they have always been great at convenient scheduling, reliable repair and follow-up, and good communication. I also wanted to mention that Northbay Automotive (one word, on the south end of town) is not at all related to the fleeting existence (?) of North Bay Automotive (two words, north end of town) which arrived a couple of years ago, and proceeded to get bad reviews and confuse people.   Stick to the south end of town folks, and you can also enjoy nearby eateries. (Mr. Mom's, Aqus).  I realize I'm sounding like the Chamber of Commerce, but I'm not. I'm a neighbor, and am happy to have good businesses in my 'hood.</text>

<Date>1539410687296< /Date><text>I have been taking my vehicles to North Bay Auto for service for twenty years now. The latest repair was this week, when the manifold in my Buick Encore had to be replaced. Mike not only gave me a ride back to my house after I dropped off my Buick, he picked me up again when the repair was complete. He had given me a detailed explanation of the design of the manifold that made replacement necessary when a vacuum seal leak occured, and even showed me the defective manifold. In my younger days getting vehicles serviced was dicey. I wasn't always sure that I was given a fair deal, and a few times I was aware I was being ripped off and took my business elsewhere. I have a lengthy relationship with North Bay Auto because these people are honest and dedicated to doing a job well.  I am secure in the knowledge that I am treated fairly and my vehicles are kept in good running order by this group. They have my highest recommendation.</text></record>

As a single mom with zero car sense, I am grateful to have found Don and his team:  reliable, prompt, communicative, helpful and trustworthy.  Who could ask for anything more?<//Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) It is a delicious meal, the girls in the kitchen are very good, but the cashiers are always angry, they treat one badly, and someone yelled at me that if I wanted to, I would return the money, please, owners of the place, pay attention to that kind of rude girls, thank you.

(Translated by Google) What they sell regularly, but the manager is a rude disrespectful and pedantic
They should improve customer service, I don't know why it always seems that they just suck lemon on the sour face.

Lo que venden regular, pero la encargada es una grosera irrespetuosa y pedante

(Translated by Google) Bless many good things
But the cashiers are very rude they don't care about anything
As if they were going to give you what you are ordering, but the owner is not interested in the comments they make about the place because it is almost always the same and with the same attitude
And the reviews are almost all from the bad cashiers

(Original)
Benden muchas cosas buenas
Pero las cajeras son muy rudas no les importa nada
Como que si te fueran a regalar loque estas ordenando , pero al pareser al dueño no le interesa los comentarios que agan del lugar porque siempre casi esta la misma y con la misma actitud
Y los review casi todos son de las malas cajeras<//review>

(Translated by Google) Today I went for a bionic and the lady who made my horden had a broom in her hand, she made me think she was sweeping, and she didn't work her hands to cut the fruit. I asked you to please wash them and it seems that it bothers you ... According to the health law an employee has to wash his hands before and after starting a new task due to the high degree of contamination (bacteria) that exists. There are millions of cases of people eating contaminated food in establishments, and even deaths due to not having the correct iguiene. Something so simple that you can avoid just hand washing ... The already mentioned young lady doesn't even apologize. And even when he received my horden I apologized for seeing him tell him to wash his hands but it seems he doesn't care. Sheet the staff take action on the matter.

(Original)
Hoy fui por un bionico y la señorita que hizo mi horden tenia una escoba en la mano, me ase pensar que estaba barriendo, y no se labo las manos para cortar la fruta. Le pedi que porfavor se las lavara y parese ser que le molesto... Deacuerdo con la ley de salubridad un empleado tiene que lavarse las manos antes y despues de empesar una tarea nueva devido al alto grado de contamination(bacteria) que existe. Hay millones de casos de personas que comen comida contaminada en establesimientos, e incluso muertes por no tener la iguiene correcta. Algo tan simple que se puede evitar con tansolo el lavado de manos... La señorita ya mensionada ni si quiera se disculpo. E incluso cuando recivi mi horden yo me disculpe por averle dicho que se lavara las manos pero parese ser que no le importo. Hojala el personal tome cartas en el asunto.</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Today I made a quick stop to Paleteria Guadalajara, and the cashier who is always there gave me bad customer service. I ordered him something and without apology he said aloud "THAT WE DON'T SERVE HERE." If you do not like to work there you balla. I don't buy there again.

Hoy hice una parada rápido a Paleteria Guadalajara, y la cajera que siempre está allí me dio mal servicio al cliente. Le ordene algo y sin disculparse dijo en voz alta "ESO NO LO SERVIMOS AQUÍ." Si no le gusta trabajar alli que se balla. No vuelvo a comprar alli.<//review></record>

<Review>Me and my wife been to this hospital’s emergency room twice. I’m writing this review sitting in it right now. We’ve been here since 3AM and now it is 8:30AM and still don’t know what’s next. Nobody tell us anything and nobody seems to care. The nurses are nice but the doctors are not. They would leave in the middle of checking my wife and never came back. We would then sitting there wait for 2-3 hours until someone came in and do the discharge. This is probably one of the worse emergency room experience we have ever had. We’re going to have to look for an alternative soon because if something were to happen in the future, I definitely would be scare to go to this hospital and I would suggest everyone to do the same.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvhi0aYsrJ4tQiqnnvoWLiNthONHQrE7P4JOJs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><user_id>108373352190817539728</user_id><user_name>TINNHI DESIGN<//user_name>< Rating>

<Review>I just had my son on 12/28/2020 and I’m so happy and blessed to have gotten the nurses I had. They took care of not just me but my husband too. They were super sweet, nice and caring. People may think there just Labor and delivery nurses but to do what they have to do and see what they have to see and still love there job is amazing! Thank u all so much! You all are very much appreciate for what you do. You made my stay there very comfortable, safe and memorable. I also forgot my baby name tag that they write down there date of birth, weight and length and the supervisor Heather went out of her way to mail it to me. So thank you Heather! Thank you to the nurses who I had and took very good care of me and baby: Haley, Lynda, Jenna and Mary.< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I am outraged with this "hospital" and their service!!! My grandfather stayed here for about a month and was treated for COVID-19 at this location. Considering the circumstance we understood we couldn't do in person visits and the only way of communication was through zoom. We initially thought the zoom call would help him and they did in a sense. Even with zoom we got the chance to meet a couple of his nurses and they seemed pretty nice and very helpful with everything going on. The only issue we had at the time of his stay was with a certain Doctor. It was within the first week of his stay, we received a phone call from this doctor advising us of the treatment options my grandfather had. His tone of delivering this message was nowhere near genuine and gave us no hope. He mentioned my grandfather needed a ventilator and we as family decided not to because we personally don't like the idea of him being connected to those machines. The doctor proceeded to inform us that he had a very little chance to recovery and we are so glad that we didn't listen to the doctor because my grandfather recovered three weeks after that call.
It wasn't until my grandfather came home and told us how poorly they treated him, he described that they were very mean, had short patience, and were aggressive at times. A hospital is meant to care for those in need and we understand that it is very overwhelming at the time but that is never an excuse to treat a patient with such disrespect and no intention to provide him with proper medical help. My family and I will never be returning to this hospital considering my grandfathers experience and others as well.</Text>< Pictures>

I saw many physician assistants and nurse practitioners in Corona Regional Hospital.

I prefer to see a doctor when I am in the hospital. I will not be returning here, instead will be making a drive to the Community hospital in Riverside or to Saint Joseph in OC.</review>

<Text>Very bad service. I never saw any ER like that in my total experience. Staff don't even KNOW about patient care. None of the staff care for patients and I believe thats the reason a lot of patient won't get the service they want. Because, none of the staff are listening to patients and care for them. The ER staff neglect everything and won't provide any service. Overall, I had a super bad experience. I was in a very bad situation and no one was willing to help. The ER was not even crowded. I am in health care profession myself and never experienced this in my life. SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE.< /Text><user>113420199892236086309</user>< Rate>

I am the kind of person that doesn't go the the ER until something is VERY wrong. I had to go  to the ER around 6 am on Friday due to severe food poisoning that had started around 4 am. I felt so unwell (the worst I have felt in a long time) and I knew I needed immediate attention.

I was allowed to see the doctor after 20 mins of waiting, which was not a long wait at all. My experience at the hospital started to worsen when a PA (not an RN)  did my IV ... incorrectly, may I add. I'm not sure if she pierced by vein through both sides but before I knew it my arm was overflowing in blood (you should see my arm bruise now). I remember the PA saying something along the lines of "I made a mess" (but lacking empathy for what she had done). I was feeling so unwell that I didn't have the strength to say anything except "ouch." My husband said that he couldn't see what was happening because the PA was shielding everything with her back. He said he didn't notice anything until the PA left and he saw all the blood smeared over my arm and the chair having a pool of blood (which she only roughly cleaned up). A few minutes after, she finished her shift and I felt so thankful and relieved that she was going to be gone and wouldn't have her taking care of me.

When I met the ER doctor, he didn't seemed empathetic at all and I almost felt like he thought I was faking how sick I felt because he kept asking me what my pain level was almost like he didn't believe me. Anyway, he gave me meds via IV which honestly only helped a little. However, I was still thankful to be feeling a little better. He also recommended a cocktail for my stomach and also a CT scan for my abdomen which took hours!

3-4 hours later of severe pain, nausea, discomfort, and severe dehydration. My IV bag was completely empty (despite my husband's constant reminder to the nurses to give me more IV).

An hour later, I finally received the cocktail and another hour later, I got a CT scan. And another hour later, I FINALLY got pain medication. It wasn't until this pain medication that I was finally able to rest and sleep.

If the doctor/nurses had only given me the stomach cocktail and the IV pain medication from the beginning I wouldn't have had to suffer through the pain for 5 hours straight. At some point, I was telling my husband that I'd rather just go home because I feel like I'd feel better at home than here due to the constant waiting..

I was unfortunately very disappointed in the level of health care at this facility. I hope this review can be taken seriously so no other person has to go through what I went through.<//Text>

I went in for an interview last week for a clinical dietitian position. When I first got the call to establish an interview date, the staff sounded friendly. However, on the date of the interview, the hospital and its staff seemed very disorganized and confused. The hospital is on a somewhat large campus and there is alot of construction going on. Although I knew who I needed to speak with, I should have asked the exact location of the interview. It would have been nice of the staff to have given me a heads up on this and perhaps a map though. Overall, this big miscommunication resulted in my interview being almost an hour late and left me waiting outside in the cold. I think this was a major factor in the interview going awry and not being able to connect during the interview. I was told that by the end of the week I would be notified of their decision, however over a week later I ended up calling them for a follow-up and ultimately there was no intention of ever updating me. Terrible professional and customer service. Do not recommend applying for a job here.<//text>

<text>The ER experience was great. Dr. Teacher, med tech Sierra, and RN Justin were wonderful. Only only complaint was the medication prescriptions weren’t completely sent to the pharmacy. They reported getting 2/3 medications that were on the discharge summary. They then told us they couldn’t fill that 2/3 cause they realized the manufacture doesn’t make those medications anymore. Calling the hospital was quick to get the 3rd medication prescription sent to another pharmacy... so it all worked out in the end... But thus the 1 star off - medications should be up to date and available ... and all prescription medications should be received by pharmacy ... not sure if it’s on hospital end for that second part. But first part of medication needs to at least be retrievable at any pharmacy is one I think this hospital could improve on...< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dcc80de8426db3:0xbe7434dc33116382< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

I came in here for a broken clavicle. They were not very thorough on my results until I started asking questio. Also I ask for my xrays before leaving and the nurse said she couldn't give me a copy. So I called back days later because my doc ask for it and the front office said they will get it but I have to pick it up. SO now I have to leave my home AGAIN! with a broken shoulder just to get my copy that should have been given to me when I ask the first time.</text>

I've been to the ER at Corona Regional a number of times over the past 20 years including a motorcycle accident, SVT and other accidents and I've never had anything but what I'd define as world-class care. I went into the packed ER last night for SVT, (pulse over 200) and I was seen within minutes. Dr Villegas and his asst Matt pulled up my history, kept me calm and gave me the necessary treatment to return my heart to normal in just minutes. In my 20 years in the service industry, I learned that when people have a bad experience, they tell an average of 10 people, when they have a good experience, they tell an average of 1 person! I always make time to praise when things go well, this hospital is by far the best I've ever been to, they consistently have the best medical staff and prioritize your ER visit based on need. My highest recommendation!< /text>

<review>Let's face it, no one wants to go to a hospital, especially an emergency room and especially on a weekend, but in all reality what started out as needing to go due to a painful abdomen stomach ache, turned out to only discover it was something much more serious, which I would not have know otherwise.

From the time I entered the ER room, to the time I was admitted everyone was helpful, providing top notch care. They truly seemed to like their jobs and helping people; and with Covid-19 they have to be extremely exhausted mentally and physically challenged daily, yet they show up to help others. So again, I am still shocked at how considerate everyone was!

The facility was clean, although not the newest hospital, had I am sure top of their class doctors, nurses, CNA, radiologists, MRI, Ultrasound techs and even the ones who wheeled you in and out of all the hospital rooms for the tests to the surgeries all proud to be a part of the Corona Regional Medical Center.

One doctor I had took time to help me FaceTime w/my husband to discuss my prognosis and what would happen next with what they discovered. This type of service I am sure is not in all hospitals, but his approach and willingness to help me and my family in this time of need, made me feel a little bit better and less stressed about my situation, which we knew nothing about and still don't. I have since been released and now I am ready to fight a battle which will more than likely be a very difficult one, but I am sure I will get through it.

I would highly recommend this hospital and or ER to anyone wanting a compassionate staff and a top notch facility.

Feeling fortunate today.</review>< username>

I will preface this by saying that everyone one I came into contact with was amazing, including the Dr who gave me devastating, but false information.  Everyone is always so helpful and they really seem to care. I've been here many time thoughout the years, and it's by far my favorite hospital.  That said, I left the emergency room this morning after a folllow up visit from two days prior completely besides myself for no reason.
I am 16 weeks pregnant, and two days ago I had light but bright red bleeding. They did an ultrasound (everything was fine, heart beat strong , saw baby moving), pelvic exam (cervix closed), blood and urine test. I did have a pretty bad uti, but that was it. I was told to come back today to recheck Hcg levels.
That's were it goes wrong. My levels the first time were in the 13,000s and dropped to the 11,000s. I was told I was most likely going to lose the baby. My numbers should have risen or doubled, and the fact they went down my pregnancy was most likely not viable. I was confused and kept saying my ultrasound was fine two days ago, could I have another. I was told, very empathetically that ultrasound didnt matter. Even with heart beat, it just shows baby is where its supposed to be now, which they already know, but that it was still going to abort. He wouldn't say for sure but it was most likely. I was very upset. He went to go ask his boss (another Dr) to double check.
When he came back his answer changed. He said for sure I was going to pass the baby. Hcg levels aren't like the stock market.  If they go down, they do not go back up.  There was nothing they could do and he was sorry. He said they would discharge me and get my paperwork. I was so upset, I just asked to leave.  I did come back hours later to get paper work for my Obgyn.
I called and made an appointment with my Obgyn and saw them this afternoon.  They told me everything was fine. I was not losing my baby. My ob said number only rise in the first trimester and they are supposed to drop after 12 weeks.  They dont even look at hcg number after 15 weeks because they are useless.  The placenta takes over making progesterone for baby and hcg levels go down, that's why you start feeling better generally after the first trimester.  He said my numbers are within range and not to worry. The heart beat was strong cervix was closed and that was the only thing that mattered.
I don't  see how I could be told something so definitively that was so wrong. The only reason they said I was losing the baby is those numbers not doubling and I'm weeks into my second trimester.  Two Drs completely devastated me for nothing. I feel bad for the Dr who gave me the news, he really seemed upset too. It was his boss who gave the curt answer, he was just paraphrasing.  I didnt appreciate the stock market  analogy either.  I am writing this hoping someone in charge see this and can relay this information so no other pregnant woman has to get such falsely devastating news.</text>

<text>My stay at Corona Regional was exceptionally great. All the nurses that attended to me were top notch! In particular Cynthia Feliciano RN, she was my attending nurse during daytime while I was in the PCU. If you're able to get her as your nurse, consider yourself a lucky person. Beyond nurses, the doctors were awesome as well, very informative and kind. I would strongly recommend Corona Regional Medical Center.< /text>< pics>

What a complete waste of time. I’m sorry, but when you visit an ER reporting a pain level of 10 you’d think you’d be treated and processed with a little urgency —- nope! Not at corona regional. I have never had to wait over an hour to receive results of an X-ray. The majority of the staff were visiting with one another or outside friends while the hurting were suffering for countless hours in the waiting area. The X-ray tech on duty was CLEARLY out of sorts (she introduced herself to me multiple times and almost broke my arm trying to complete the X-ray). If he blonde woman at the front desk check in was extremely rude. Not sure what happened last night, as I usually have a great experience at this hospital.

Sad they spend a ton of money expanding, but can’t even get the right staff to fill the departments that need a caring hand most.<//Text>

I want to start off by stating that I was not sure how a hospital setting would be during our trying COVID times, but from the minute I walked through the door, I felt listened to, informed, easily directed, and cared for. From the person at the door, to the intake nurse, the doctors, blood taking team, medicine givers, xray technicians and billing, everyone was amazing. My fearful reason for being there was easily put at ease by everyone's quick assistance and happy, easygoing energy. I absolute loved my experience, and how many people can say that about an ER? Great job to everyone at the Corona Regional Medical Center Emergency Room! YOU ROCK!!<//review>

I was scheduled to have the stone removed by laser on April 7th by my urologist but couldn't take the pain and discomfort anymore. After they gave me pain meds, did a ct scan and consulted with my urologist they offer to keep me overnight for pain management or give me a pain med prescription. I took the latter. They said they couldn't remove the stone because the equipment neccessary wasnt on site then and couldn't do the procedure as a result. I guess I should have gone to Orange county for care.

<text>EDITORIAL NOTE: I am not part of this hospital staff. I'm stating this because people will probably believe my motives are not genuine. These are my thoughts which are not prompted by anything other than the terrible tragedies happening nation wide during this pandemic

My wife was sent to this hospital because she had multiple organ failure. I was impressed with how attentive and caring her doctors and nurses were.

I want to implore everyone to understand that hospital staffs are under enormous strain right now. Lives are being lost and there is nothing these people can do about it because they already tried to help us. The medical community tried to implore us to keep our distance, wear masks and stay home whenever possible. We didn't and now we are reaping the whirlwind of our own stupid, collective decisions.

Hospital staffs are overwhelmed. Know that there are many patients these people have to get too. They simply can't staff enough to cover everything. If our loved ones pass (and my own mother did) don't blame the hospital staff that you went too. If you are looking for someone to blame, it's the Federal governments response and the people of this nation that didn't take the warnings and guidelines seriously. Even at this very MOMENT we have California republicans attempting to over turn stay at home orders and the San Bernardino county Sheriff recently saying he won't enforce the orders. MADNESS!!!!!!

I am so sorry for what hospital staffs are going through. I am so sorry that you people are getting trampled under foot from this pandemic that didn't have to be this bad. There may be nobody that has more right to be angry than them.</text>< response>

I arrived at the hospital barely could breath from the pain and Dr.Henderson just started touching my back roughly and asked no questions he ordered test and said he can’t do anything for my pain had no patience for someone that was in so much pain and can barley even talk better yet walk. He was rude and he shouldn’t be a doctor has no sympathy to help someone who was really in bad pain .
I hate this hospital , last time it was a nurse talking about me with colleges and now the doctor from the emergency room . If I went to the hospital it’s because I really needed your help !< /Review>< Rating>

Very unhappy with my experience in the ER on the evening  of Friday March 5. I had been having terrible RUQ abdomen pain for over a week. My primary care doc had ordered an ultrasound  earlier in the week that came back negative. The pain persisted so I was advised to go to the ER. My regular doctor is with Memorial Care in Irvine. I would have preferred going to a memorial care hospital but it was too far to have my husband drop me off and.pick me up again since I couldn't drive myself. I spent about 4 hours in the waiting area being called back about 4 times 1) For a quick ultrasound of my abdomen- which was the only time I spoke to a doctor that evening 2) to draw blood and get medication 3) for a CT scan 4) to be told by a nurse that everything was negative and I can leave.

Honestly everyone was pretty kind and respectful until I got to the end when the RN told me everything was negative and and I could leave. I was in a lot of pain and I knew something was up. I pointed out a small red painful rash to her and asked of it was possible that I had shingles.  The nurse was automatically dismissive like she didnt want me to waste her time with dumb questions. She insisted emphatically "NO...thats not shingles....that?? That's RANDOM". Random??? She had me sign my paperwork and sent me on my way perplexed and in pain. They didnt even offer prescription medication.

Turns out I did have shingles. And because this nurse didn't bother listening to me or even having a doctor see me, I had to begin antiviral treatment after the 72 hour window recommended. I was finally diagnosed that following Monday morning where I had 2 REAL doctors who immediately recognized that I obviously had shingles . Knowing about the mystery RUQ pain and taking a quick glance at my abdomen was all they needed to diagnose me.

The last I checked..ERs charge a hefty sum to insurance companies. Not to mention my copay and time wasted at the ER. I cant believe a doctor never actually spoke to me except for the quick 30 second ultrasound and never bothered to speak to me afterwards about what the pain might be and what to do next. The attitude of the nurse was literally "we did all we could do for you...i dont know what's wrong with you...you can leave now". It's just UNBELIEVABLE and upsetting that medical care can be this negiligent.<//text>

<text>I would be doing a disservice to my community if I do not share my experience. I am hoping that it will shed some light on certain things that are wrong about how we care for patients and I pray for some change. I was rushed to Corona Regional by ambulance due to excruciating pain in my back and leg. Of course due to covid my loved ones couldn't be by my side in the ER. The first nurse that attended to me was nice but unfortunately her shift ended as soon as I got there. Let me just say that the doctor in charge, Dr Glenn, asked me questions in the hallway once i got there with the ambulance crew. I was then given a bed. She ordered some tests from the little i told her coming in. The second nurse came in. I was in pain and i had to call each time to follow up on what i needed to do to get the ball rolling. A urine test was needed and I was told that unless all the tests that the doc had ordered were ready I wouldn't see the doc. At that point I insisted on trying to provide that urine sample just so everything was put together for the doc to come back as soon as possible. I did not get much help from that second nurse. Remember again I could barely move and I was in some crazy pain. I managed to get the urine sample and still did not get any assistance to clean my bed pad or anything. Fast forward the doc comes back with my results, CT blood etc. She then told me that she was going to find out about  the last pain med i was given and just like that never came back. Did not ask me if I had anymore questions, nothing. The nurse comes in with my release form. Of course I was surprised that the doc was just gone. I absolutely asked for the doc back. Anyway from there I was told to follow up with my PD because there was nothing that needed urgent med intervention there, according to the results. The nurse asked me if I needed a wheelchair, i declined because I just couldn't sit. I was waiting for my husband so pull up with the car so I could drag myself out and quickly lay in my car. She left the room after I declined the wheelchair and comes back 10mns later to ask me if I needed help to get up. From her tone I realized that she needed me out of that bed. Number one , yes I needed help...even a 2 years old playing pretend doctor would have known that i needed help. Number 2, she wanted me to go and wait in the waiting room but how is that possible in so much pain and when i couldn't even sit down? She simply told me with the most insensitive tone that I could go there and stand. I reminded her that I had no shoes on. She told me that she could give me socks😖. She comes back with socks and just puts them far from my reach and tells me that I didn't have to be rude, just because I asked how was she expecting me to go and wait in the waiting room in all this pain when my husband was only 5mns away and I could not even walk or stand? Anyway, she left the room and never came back to help me put the socks on or even get my self off the bed. In severe pain I managed to do this by myself. In tears I dragged myself out of the ER. Also, at some point when I was in there my machine was unhooked after 30 long minutes i end up pressing the assistance button. A nurse that i didn't know comes in to hook me up again. I then asked for a pillow because all this time I had no pillow. She brought me one and stood by the curtain in front of my bed and literally threw the pillow at my chest. I was shocked, but I thought that maybe because of covid she didn't want to touch me. I slowly managed to put it behind my head all in excruciating pain. Also, the whole time all I could hear was doctors and nurses gossip about other co-workers and laugh when i was laying there in agony. Just to say it was super annoying. Well all this to simply ask that if you have no sympathy genes, a carrier in the medical field is not for you. Corona Regional ER you need to train your staff better. After all you expect me to pain thousands of dollars for tests and a bed that you couldnt wait to kick me out of disregarding the state I was in. Shame on you!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Amazing staff! Everyone was welcoming and had good conversation. The Department was on the slower end so I didn’t feel forgotten. X-ray took longer than expected but the staff helped expedite it by calling and walking me down to radiology. 10/10 would recommend. The techs in grey were very helpful from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out.

Every step of the way, I found empathy in the staff. The nurse who took my vitals, the doctor who evaluated me, the x-ray techs, the woman who registered me to get blood drawn, and the nurse who drew my blood - all of them extended empathy and a genuine concern for me to feel better. This made ALL the difference to me.<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><text>During this difficult time I believe the hospital can do better on informing a wife on a husband treatment and test results. There should be someone calling or emailing this information on a regular basis.  Doctors are busy so I understand why they can’t call everyone but maybe a website or an email system could be used to inform us on what is going on.  Talking to a patient who is on heavy pain medicine is not the person that should be informed since they remember little of what is told to them.

<Text>Tuesday around 2am I went to the emergency with a case of food poisoning,  one of the male nurses proceeded to insert an IV, I’ve never been so tortured in my live, then a second guy and later a third one trying to insert the needle in my hand.and both arms. I’m terribly swallowing and I have bruises all over, you will think that personnel in an emergency room are better knowledgeable and experienced for something that should be so routine. I will be scared to ever come to that place again<//Text>< gmapID>

<text>This is the second time in 5 months I've had to go to the ER. Everyone there was very professional and seemed to really enjoy what they do. They all seemed to really care about their patients. Obviously like most ERs across the nation they were very busy so your wait times are very long but it's understandable and they really do seem to do the best they can. I'm thankful to have such a good hospital here locally. Thanks guys!<//text></record></dataset><record>

The experience at the Emergency service @ Corona Regional has been horrible and torturing. Last night(10/03/20) I checked in around 9:45 pm as I might have sprained my left knee earlier that day. There were not a lot of patients at the waiting room. I was seen by the PA around 11:45 and he said I better do an xray. Then I waited till 1:30 AM --no one came calling my name. I asked several individuals about how long I might have to wait so that I can make a decision. I was told it could take upto 6 hours as their system was down. They think they own you as you need treatment. What they need to realize that we are their patients and customers paying their bills. I had similar experience several years back. I will find another ER for my needs in the future ( God forbid). Most of the nurses could care less as several of us complained about the wait time.They need to revisit  their process in the ER and improve .<//Text>

They shrug everyone and everything off. I had an infection after getting my wisdom tooth out and had 103 degree fevers for several days before I ended up passing out and falling. I had to take an ambulance to the ER and instead of helping me, they blamed covid and did nothing. Just told me to quarantine. I even had blood tests that pointed to infection that they said "came back fine" and after checking online, you can see they definitely did not come back fine. I then had multiple negative covid test results and only got better because I found some old penicillin in my room.

This happened in the past, and to my dad with kidney disease. This hospital literally doesn't care about patients at all and if you have something they don't see every day, they're too lazy and egotistical to even listen to your symptoms. Let alone treat you. Absolutely abysmal help, and  consistently at that. They make this a habit of shrugging everyone off. I've seen countless people even crying about it in the waiting rooms. It's pathetic for a place people go for treatment. The docs and nurses are too numb to care, and just do the bare minimum.<//Text>

If you’re looking to take care of a boo boo this is the spot don’t ever come here for serious medical attention the staff and doctors are A REAL JOKE !

<review>This is a cold and impersonal Hospital, from the entrance, they ask you a few questions while the two employees were having a personal chat, while they ask you questions. For 10 minutes no one even talked to me while they were behind the glass area, then they  asked me to open a gate with a single handle that increased my fears for covid-19.
They kept me i  a very small living room type  waiting area with children  crying, people talking to themselves, while nurses and staff cane in/out through doble doors slamming shot over and over,, i got a headache in addition yo my arm pain. The place is dirty, furniture pipes are sawed  off and covered with tape, missing screws in the chairs. Next time i would drive someplace else risking my life instead of coming back to this second class clinic.,employees need sensitivity and care training. Stop treating people as numbers.,.< /review><GmapID>0x80dcc80de8426db3:0xbe7434dc33116382< /GmapID>< Resp>

I went to the hospital because I had a hard time breathing. It only took me 5 minutes to sign in after the coronavirus check in. I saw a doctor that took all my information and then I went had some tests done and then I was put in the emergency room. After 1 hour the doctor came with my results indicating that I have fluids in my lungs. Gave me a prescription and I was on my way home total experience was little under 2 hours and all the staff and doctors were professional and helpful.😇🌹🌹<//text>

Staff was nice but the process was unacceptable. I was made aware of my results in the waiting room in front of other patients/visitors. After diagnosis patients moved sitting after being in the same place for over an hour,  which made me feel very uncomfortable.<//text>

<name>Moheb Mokhtar</name><Date>1600673056564</Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews for this hospital. I was just discharged. I came in Sunday night complaining of stomach pain and complications eating. I had previously gone to San Antonio ER in Upland and they just ran the usual blood and urine test, along with an ultrasound. They said I was showing signs of pancreatitis but gave me no real diagnosis. They then discharged me with only a prescription for pain. Here at Corona Regional they examined me right away and ran more tests. They also gave me medication for my stomach pain, which is something the staff at San Antonio did not do for me. I was at San Antonio for 5 hours. I got in and out here at Corona Regional, got something for pain relief, and got a clear diagnosis with a prescription to solve my stomach problems. The entire staff including the nurses and doctors were phenomenal. I know where I'll be going the next time I have an emergency. Thank you to the staff at Corona Regional. You guys were amazing.<//Text>< Pics>

Checked into ER on 21 Oct 7pm to get an ultrasound on some swelling on my leg. I left 9pm. Very impressed with the service standards. I come from Singapore and when we check into ER at 7pm, we usually expect to leave past midnight.

The staff were polite and warm. I could tell that they actually care about my condition. I do not see this human touch in Singapore and I am very impressed with the human touch the staff showed, despite all of them being busy.

The idea of bringing portable kits to check vitals or administer medicine is good too as that cuts down waiting time. It was efficient and a good display of lean methodology.< /text>

<Text>I've always hated to go to "emergency" due to long waits, workers are impatient, rude and insensitive with patients sickness/conditions. So, not a fan of going to ER at all...

BUT ... my experience on Saturday afternoon was totally different. The nurses were super nice especially Sarah who took care of me. the receiving reps  were great. The doctor who assisted me was very compassionate. It was an overall amazing experience with Corona Reg Med Center. Thumbs up to fantastic service they provided. It is totally unexpected and I am hoping they will continue on this trend.

I was having a serious medical condition on Saturday and went to the ER as suggested from an after hours nurse line.

Their “care” consisted of telling me
1. There wasn’t anything they could do to stop what was happening (should I have just stayed home?)
2. Having me go back and forth from the lobby to the nurses area a total of 3 times while I am crying in pain and could barely walk
The doctor didn’t feel the need to put me in a bed where I could be alone away from everyone else as I was experiencing a pivotal moment in my life.
I felt like a number and not like a human. And the way some of the nurses talked to the other patients was unbelievable. You could guess who has been doing this for way too long. I understand the hospital staff was unusually busy however they needed to take a step back and realize why people come to the hospital to begin with: For CARE.
Corona Regional, you completely mortified me and my experience all together was unacceptable.<//Text>

<text>I'm sick but I wasn't too sick to check for emergency rooms reviews. Like many, this one had a lot negatives & some positives, so I was hesitant but I needed care so I went. On the way there I prayed to God for everything to go quickly, straight to the point, & helpful. I must say it went just like that, everyone I came in contact with from time I walked in the door was absolutely great! I was only there a 1hr & a half.

I was a patient in there. I had mental encephalitis, which  none of the drs were able to determine what I had. They kept giving me the wrong medication. I was not getting any better. Some nurses were good. But the Hispanic nurses were lazy or unprofessional; even though I’m also Hispanic and I have worked on the medical field, I know I have treat everyone with the same care unlike some of those nurses. The only good thing was that they send me to another hospital that did know what I did actually had. And knew what I had within few days that I was in there. Corona regional hospital did not even send my test or results to the other hospital, the other hospital has to redo the tests again and knew what I had after few days. Where as , in Corona Regional, I stayed a whole month and nothing good came from them, except my transfer. If they act unprofessional with you or a love one that is staying please seek help else where!!<//review>

Arrived @4:35am with lower stomach & back pain. The two staff at the front desk were very nice and helpful. In a lot of pain I was placed in a bed @5:25am and given an IV and medicine for the pain. CT scan is next but they said it should be 3 more hours. Waiting room was pretty empty except for two families. I was very nervous to come here due to the horrible reviews. I almost drive 30 min to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Orange because that’s where my OB is. Due to my horrible pain I came here which was 7 min away and feel they have been  kind and as quick as they could to get me situated. Cynthia was my nurse and she was very sweet and answered any question I have had.< /review>

<review>Today I had to visit the ER at Corona Regional Medical Center. I was seen very quickly by the doctor, who ordered a test to confirm his diagnosis.
I want to give my doctor and Ultrasound technician, LaVelle, 5 stars. They were both amazing and had great bedside manor.
The reason for 3 stars is due to the fact that after I had my ultrasound, I was told to go sit in the waiting room with all the other patients.
I had just had a major surgery, with a wound that is still healing.
I asked one of the nurses if I could sit somewhere, where I would not be exposed to all the people in the waiting room that were coughing and sneezing.
She had me sit in a common area in the back by the nurses station, with more sick people just standing around me.
There were many empty rooms with beds that would have allowed me to rest comfortably with out having to be exposed to sick people with my wound that was still healing.
Why have all of these rooms if no one is allowed to use them? I’m not sure if this is a normal practice or if the staff that was on duty decided it was best to have several sick people just sitting and standing around each other.

<review>I just had a small procedure done yesterday, as an out-patient.  I cannot say enough great things about the staff, from the person who checked me in, to the nurses and the OR tech who helped me.  All smiles, and bright, cheery faces and even voices.  What a great group!
Both doctors, my anesthesiologist, and the doctor who treated me, were kind, professional, and took the time to listen to me, and answer my last-minute questions.
The unit I was in even has these very nice surgical gowns that plug into a sort of blow dryer.  It keeps you warm in an environment they keep cold for some sort of sterile reasons.
Even after I woke up, everyone was seeking about my comfort and care.  The recovery room nurse I had was very caring and had a great sense of humor, too!  They say laughter is the best medicine, and I was laughing most of the time.  I don't know if they go to stand-up comic school, but she was terrific!
When I left, I kept having the feeling I wasn't at a hospital, but had just visited this really intensive health spa.  As I write this, I feel better than I have in months!
If I need medical attention, Corona Regional is definitely my first choice.  I'd give them 6 stars if I could!</review>< pictures>

My mother was hospitalized in Corona Regional hospital  and I was impressed with the people that I came across with. I am a nurse myself working in 2 great institution of University of California Irvine and Kaiser Permanente. These  2 hospitals are both big and I am proud to work there but what impressed me about the nurses, nursing assistants and the support staff of Corona Regional hospital is the genuine desire of the staffs to care and help.  They seem to love what they do. Indeed,  the greatest treasure of an institution are the people,  the employees.  Fancy buildings are wonderful but it's the employees that elevate the experience to a very satisfying instead of a miserable one.< /Review>

Would not recommend to anyone. Providers here need to take a step back and realize the vast majority of patients do not want to be in the ER and need to start treating their patients like humans and not numbers.<//Review>

<Date>1592227161752<//Date><rate>5</rate><review>June 14, 2020 visit. Unbelievably quick, kind and efficient. During this pandemic, don't fear going to E. R. if you feel the need. Especially at Corona Regional. Intake was quick. Not crazy about needles but Janette.....You were amazing! Hope I spelled that correctly.
Dr. Fenster, brilliant. Yes, they were getting busier by the minute but the attention she gave made you feel like everything was going to be just fine. She is sharp, kind, direct, she listened and she's very much to the point.
X-ray tech... darn it, forgot his name.. a gentle, kind  and very efficient as well. Thank you guys for everything. I hope I don't have to return! Lol but, if I ever need an E. R., it's here that I will return to! God bless you all!!! ❤< /review>< Pics>

<text>If you value your life run from corona regional. Same problems for 15 years +. Just tried to use them again now that hospital supposedly is upgraded. They failed again. 3 months for a heart patient test and never told me they couldnt do it. Went in 3 times. I guess a serious heart patient is of NO concern to Corona regional. If your loved one is in need of care I would suggest running from Corona Regional< /text>< gmapID>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Run for you life! My Mother went there on Saturday with a collapsed lung and is leaving there with a collapsed lung,it took them NINE days to admit it was beyond their expertise while poking and prodding her repeatedly. Don’t know the extent of the damage yet but since we are having her transferred to a different hospital we hope to find out. My biggest peeve is that on Friday after 7 days her lung was 99% ready for the biopsy and they told us they don’t do biopsy on the weekend and she had to sit there all weekend waiting for Monday only to discover the lung was failing again because someone taped over the tube and lung was not draining. No one even checked one her all weekend and that was the second time the tube was malfunctioning totally due to people not knowing what they were doing. I hope they didn’t cause permanent damage to my 87 year old Mother. Besides that the hospital is run down, everything s brown and depressing.
I wish I could give them a no star rating but one star rating is as low as you can go.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1584471868897, 'text': "Hi, Donna.

The late night nurses and charge nurse was exceptional and attentive. They checked in often and vocally calmed my husband while his meds kicked in. My only complaint is they put my husband who had surgery in a room with a man who had pneumonia. The man had at least 6 visitors at any given moment including children that were playing with my husbands walker, pushing toys into his section of the room and running in the halls and near by rooms. I asked if we would be able to switch rooms because I was nervous my husband would be more Susceptible to caching it, but was brushed off.</Review>

< review>
I took my 5 year old son to this ER on Saturday. He was having high fevers (101, 102, 103) on and off since Friday night, a bad ear ache, his throat was hurting and he had a rash all over his body (like permanent chills). They did a throat swab when i said he’s had strep throat before and got those little bumps all over his body (Scarlett fever) so they did a throat swab, gave him some Tylenol for the fever, and sent us on our way saying the results came back NEGATIVE, he didn’t have an ear infection, and to just switch off between Motrin and Tylenol every 3 hours for the fever and to buy some Benadryl because the rash was most likely due to an allergic reaction. They prescribed ZERO medications. 3 hours later, Motrin. 3 hours later Tylenol. So on and so forth every 3 hours, Benadryl before bed two nights in a row. He woke up this morning with a 104 fever so i took him to a different emergency room in riverside. I told them he had been tested on Saturday (today is Tuesday) for strep and it came back negative. So of course they didn’t test for that, which they should have anyways, but whatever. They drew blood, did a chest X-ray, everything came back normal. They prescribed him amoxicillin and ear drops because sure enough, he indeed has an ear infection. About 2 hours after i got home, i get a call from Corona, this place, and the chick says that they got his results back and that they came back POSITIVE for strep. So for THREE DAYS, he could’ve been on antibiotics, a FIVE YEAR OLD, who is suffering daily and taking meds he doesn’t need to be taking, because your results came back negative. And now they’re all of a sudden positive. If you have kids, you know the devastation of seeing them suffer and not being able to do anything to help them. Thinking what you were told to do is already helping, when in fact it’s not, because he wasn’t properly treated. We will not be returning. I understand with everything that’s going on, emergency rooms, urgent cares, etc., they’re extremely busy, cautious, and have a lot going on. But anything could’ve happened to my child. And this was unacceptable.<//review>

I recently had surgery at this facility, even after hearing such bad reviews of this place this is where my doctor performed the surgery so I went, I have to say this was the best place that I’ve ever been. I am also in the medical field and every person I dealt with that day was so comforting so compassionat and  took such good care of me. I was so afraid to be put to sleep, these people made such a difference in my anxiety and my overall experience,As they came in to wheel me to surgery the two nurses that were taking care of me came and hugged me and told me everything was gonna be all right, the two nurses in the surgery room held my hand until I was put to sleep and constantly checked on me when I woke up there an amazing team the most compassionate caring people I’ve come across in my life. Thank you all of you for making such a difference in my experience and for taking such good care of me<//Review>

The moment I walked in to the emergency dept. I knew I came to the right place. I had an allergic reaction to something I ate or drank. My throat swelled and closed up. I could still breath thru my nose. At the desk I said as best I could I was having an allergic reaction... then was told to come inside to sit while they took my vitals and info. Next thing I knew I was taken to a room where I was immediately treated with meds and monitors. My nurses Sara and Carlos? were amazing. Made me feel very comfortable. The Dr was just as amazing. I can’t remember his name but am very thankful. He came back to check on me before I was taken to a room with a bed. The shifts changed and the new nurse and Dr was just as amazing. The treatments worked and I was released to go home. As busy as it was in your emergency dept. your staff was on top of it. I hope I never need to return again but I will if need to. I will also tell everyone I know locally about my experience.</text>

All the Doctors and Nurses attended to my needs quick and kindly, although I don't like to complain , my discharge paperwork did not state which drug was administered during my visit and I had some side affects. Would have like to have that information so that I may have been able to google what to look fkr or do.< /text>

The doctor I had does not  know me or my treatment.  She  was going to do it her way or be a bully.  She threatened to call my doctor because I would not agree to her terms.  Please call him.  She did and he set her straight. I didn't see her again.  The  technician I had by the name of Dana was wonderful both technicians I had were wonderful the nursing staff was great everybody else was fine except arguing with the doctor but I'd go back again.</Review>

Everyone on 1st shift was so attentive. Linda 1st shift charge nurse was extremely helpful.  My husband Van is a very private person, so when we ended up in a4 person room he wanted to go home. I explained to Linda to please change Van to a2 person room. She explained when i complained that i had Good insurance, it wasn't because of insurance, they were short of beds and that the moment she had one open she would change Van. She did. McKenna, Red, Vivek were the best.  Can't remember the other names but we're good too. thank you.     I will say i was disappointed that in ER and the hospital was not the cleanest. Never saw anyone push a broom. Sorry.< /review>

This is the worst Hospital I have ever been to in my entire life. The wait to even be assessed was excruciatingly long and the Emergency waiting room had urine on two of the seats and there were bloody bandages on the floor. I was discharged for a kidney infection before they even received my blood results back from the lab and without doing any imaging to see if there was any damage even though I could barely walk. They had to poke me 7 times before they were able to get blood for my labs. The doctor tapped on my back and my side to see if it hurt and from that I was diagnosed. They had me bend over a random bed and gave me a shot of antibiotics and that was it. kidney infection can be life threatening if untreated and this is how they handled it. Unprofessional and unsanitary.< /Text>

Sat in the ER for 11.5 hours.  Had to ask 4 times for a doctor to come in and give us a diagnosis and blood work results.  GI suite machines were broken for several days prior to our visit and they could not perform the test they needed to.  Spent several hours debating about admitting to the hospital or transferring to another hospital.  This isn't the 1st time we have had problems here but it definitely be the last.  I wouldn't recommend Corona Regional to my enemy.  Terrible experience.< /text>

<review>Our family member was admitted to ER. First off, we had the misfortune of having Dr Sean O'Brien Henderson assigned. This is a horrible human being let alone a horrible doctor. This man is dismissive, impatient, misogynistic, condescending and does not listen to his patients. He is old and tired and it shows. If you are admitted to ER, ask for another physician or stick with a PA instead.  The nursing staff was adequate in their timeliness to aid patients, however, they need to behave more professionally. Too much laughing, joking and noise. We watched as a staff member was dancing like a lunatic while others carried on loudly, knowing that patients are trying to rest. I finally had to speak to the Charge Nurse about it. It is seen as a careless attitude it does not reflect a professional demeanor in the ER, especially when they are surrounded by patients and family members that are going through a lot of grief and suffering.<//review>< pictures>

<Date>1571699355620</Date><Review>My first time to an ER for myself and I was referred by my urgent care. The people at the ER were nice, it was clean and actually pretty fast. The bad part was no diagnosis, how do you go to a ER and ask what’s wrong with me and they tell you “I don’t know”. Now I can’t trust this place if I go to you in pain shouldn’t you find out why? No you just took my $200 copay. I wish I could say I won’t go back but it’s our local hospital. I want to see change in our ER. If your not sure then get another doctor to figure it out don’t tell your patients IDK? No recommendations from me to go here but I couldn’t give you a 1 because the staff minus the doctor was great.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I was kept in the hallway for over two hours before being placed into a room. Worse hospital ever. Nursing staff just walking around doing nothing. Dr Park was not attentive and was unconcerned about my care. This place really need to be under new management by a company that knows how to provide patient care. One word Awful!< /Text>

Best ER experience I've ever had!  I have heard not so great things about this place moving to Corona and was hesitant to take my 4yr old in. But we had no choice and I was pleasantly surprised by my entire experience. All of the front desk gals we're extremely nice to us and the nurses and doc who came in made us, especially my son, feel so comfortable. The doc took her time answering all of my questions  and we were in and out in less than and hour and a half which never happens in an ER. The place was very clean and the check in and out ran very smooth. Great job guys!< /Review>

Be careful here.  If you are admitted; and then bother the staff or cause a nuisance they may over sedate you.  I wish we never took my grandpa here.  He had a routine infection and did not recover after he was heavily sedated.  He became confused and irate and bothersome to the nurses.  They knocked him out with drugs and he never came back.  I miss you grandpa.<//text>

<text>Very good MD very good RN very sloppiness on the part of the Lab lady three attempts for blood
Work that’s not bad part it’s sloppiness of her technique after each attempt no clean up blood everywhere sometimes it’s takes multiple attempts understandable however you use technique  to stop blood from going everywhere
Otherwise it was five stars good  ER< /text>< pics>

I had my baby January 11th 2020 I had an amazing labor and delivery experience. Cyril was my favorite nurse he was funny and amazing 🙂. Everyone made sure I was comfortable and made me feel reassured that I could do it. Definitely can’t wait for my next baby to be born here especially with the help of dr.koning!!< /Text>

I was so impressed with the staff in this department, I felt compelled to write a review. They did everything right! Margie (my RN) went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. Any concerns or questions I had were taken care of. The hospital is lucky to have her. Great communication between all staff, I knew everyone was on the same page. The radiologist listened to my concerns about the sedation and I'm happy to say that I went home awake and alert...no nausea. Thank you to everyone in that department! This includes all the other smiling faces I didn't get to meet. : )</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I went into the ER this morning around 1:00 am due to a sore throat.  I was impressed with the service.  They took my information, checked my vitals, had me wait in one of the examination rooms, took X-rays of my chest and neck, went to a waiting room, got my results, paid my co-pay and out the door I went.   The whole process took about 2 1/2 hours. Staff was friendly and the doctor answered my questions.   Thank you!< /Review>< resp>

Everyone that i interfaced with, from the Receptionist, to the Transport Personnel, to the Admittance Clerk, Nurses, Anetheseologist, Technicians, Phlebotomist and Doctor, performed their functions on an optimal professional and personable level, as far as I could assess during my stay.  Thank you for making my experience a good one yesterday.  Kudos to everyone invloved.</review>< Rate>

< review>
I went to the e.r. today in horrible pain in my stomach. Side note I get pancreatitis around 2x's a year and I was positive I had it again. I actually got into a bed really fast. My blood was drawn & was given pain, nausea and fluid through an i.v. When my blood came back the dr. Came in and said my lipase as 1,500, its supposed to be around 395. Also any time your lipase is over 1,100 you should be admitted because pancreatitis can cause your other organs to shut down! The dr. says he is DISCHARGING me with nausea meds and follow up with my dr. I asked can I get pain meds since it's a weekend and I wont be able to get in with my dr. Most likely until Tuesday. He said no just take tylenol. I looked at him and said if I could take tylenol for the pain why would I be there in the first place? His answer was sorry I'm not allowed to give you any call your dr.  I hate the doctors there! Go to a different hospital if you care about your health!<//review>

My mom went into the ER for an infection on her toe and she had high blood pressure. The Doctor seemed nice and helped my mom with the treatment on her toe. However, when they were releasing her to go home my mom’s blood pressure was still high and the nurse notified the doctor to see if she could give her a dose of the medication they had prescribed to her. The doctor said it wasn’t necessary because my mom had gotten upset and she had a history of not taking her medication. I found this very unprofessional because as a doctor, it her duty to make sure her patients are feeling well and that their vital signs are stable before sending a client home. Beware of these incompetent “professionals” that you’re trusting your life with.< /Text>

<Review>A big thanks to the ER staff for fixing me up on New Years day after I had a nasty jagged laceration from a hand saw. I was looked at very fast and treated in no time flat. Spent less than an hour and a half in the ED before being discharged. I fully healed a month after the experience. Excellent care!

This hospital definitely needs to expand like Riverside Community to serve more of Corona. Other than that good experience.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>I gave birth here recently the labor and delivery nurses and my dr were amazing, Jennifer was so helpful and funny! That’s really the only reason I’m giving this place any stars ! Cause the nurses that took care of me after I gave birth were so rude and mean to me saying I have a low pain tolerance and that I didn’t even have a c section so I shouldn’t be complaining of my pain. Excuse me I had a Episiotomy and would other things happen to me. I have also had broken bones in the past and snap my ankle two times and I was able to tolerate that pain.  They were rough with me and never respected my person privacy when I ask for just some time to use a bathroom or take a shower. I don’t need to be exposed to everyone while I’m trying to use the toilet. I know were the call button is. I just wish they had more compassion with first time moms and any mom for that matter.<//Text><Name>micgose47< /Name><date>1571420315471</date>< pics>

<rate>2</rate><review>My experience here . . . AWFUL!  My husband went in for severe abdominal pains and of course this was the closest hospital to our doctor's office.

We arrived at 11:00 am and left at 7:00 pm.  It was so unsanitary there.  NO ROOM whatsoever to do any sort of procedures.  I mean if OSHA was to come and see how the flow is, I'm sure they will get written all sorts of citations.  In any situation when you are in hospital you should be able to find your nearest exit.  Well it's difficult here because there is barely any room to move anywhere.  You are basically elbow to elbow with other patients and the hospital staff there.

Let's start off by saying, when my husband was getting is IV put in, I had to remind the nurse to flush after drawing his blood.  The hospital was FILTHY.  I mean filthy enough that I came home with an infestation of fleas.  My husband I counted my flea bites and I have over 50-60 from sitting in a chair for almost 7 hours.  I went to my doctor and she said luckily I didn't need a blood transfusion. My physician whom saw my flea bites said it's very common that hospitals have infestation problems due to all the transients and homeless people that come through.

I use to work at a medium security prison in Texas and it was cleaner there then this hospital. I use to work at a hospital too and NEVER had bites EVER and I was surrounded by patients who came from all walks of life.

NEVER EVER AGAIN! I am so embarrassed for myself to even write this review because I feel so disgusted that I even went that this hospital.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Went to the ER in excruciating pain in my stomach and cold/ flu symptoms about 2am on 10-19-19. When the person took my blood pressure In triage my BP was 186/123 which is considered a hypertensive emergency. During the 4 hours at the ER my BP was not check again which I found very strange. On top of that the Doctor Phu I believe his name was was very rude and made me feel as though he wanted to get me out of there as fast as he could. He even tried to advise against a CT scan saying I would be there for hours. I told him I still wanted the CT which seemed to annoy him. I told him that I had been suffering from a cough / cold and was concerned that maybe my hernia was stuck. “He replied if your hernia was stuck you’d be throwing up and not be able to stop” My mom mentioned that maybe I also needed some antibiotics for my cold.  Dr phu was very condescending and made us feel uncomfortable asking questions. He responded “I don’t know why everyone thinks they need antibiotics when they get a cold. It’s a virus and the antibiotics would not work Then Dr Phu proceeded to  rudely ask me “haven’t you ever had a cold before?” . My mom was with me and witnessed all this disorganization. She even went to several nurses to request more pain meds and to advise that they needed to check my BP because my face was really red and I was doubled over in pain but all her requests were ignored. At 6am someone came in to tell me that all my labs and CT  looked good and I was being discharged. Also I heard the doctor talking to the nurse about my BP being 186/123 and the doctor asked frantically “186/123???” Then I heard the nurse say okay I’ll change it without even taking my blood pressure again. When I followed up with my PCP on the following Wednesday, turns out I had and have had bronchitis/pneumonia and yes antibiotics were necessary during the time of my ER visit and I could have gotten the care I needed at the time if the ER doctor would have just listened or did further evaluation. My PCP was also concerned about my blood levels, especially my Lipase and would like to follow up on possible pancreatitis or possible kidney issue given the type of pain I was experiencing and the other blood levels. Also going over the CT scan with me it shows that there were findings in abnormalities in my lungs which was never addressed with me. They just sent me on my way. Also my BP is of concern and my Dr upped my BP meds Fortunately I didn’t have a stroke but could have due to the negligence at Corona Regional Medical Center. I plan on filing a complaint with the medical board and will be seeking legal advice.< /text>< rate>

after call 911, six mins after ambumlance appeared and bring my daddy to hospital (ER) but when he was at hospital, he had to wait over 45 mins to see doctor, and he could not breath... just wait and wait, just 2 guy stand behind my daddy and nothing, 2 guys were very nice but they could not do anything because they are not doctor, just stand and look at monitor, do you understand “emergency”...if you dont have doctor, hiring more, insurance will pay....

<Review>Rude, dirty, unfit doctors, 2 back to back days went in there for tbe same injury,  2 different doctors gave 2 totally different diagnosis,  both wrong.  Tried to pay with my insurance,  Gizeller the operator is RUDE as can be, the ER department i tried over and over to give the insurance card,  they are incompetent.

Had the unfortunate event to have to visit the ER on New Year’s Eve and we are out of towners. This was a great ER the nurses and the rest of the staff are in constant movement.  We liked how instead of just sitting and waiting your rapidly moved thru the different test you might need to have done so in the end everything is ready for the doctors review and diagnosis. There was a bit of a wait but it was expected because of the high volume of patients they had.  But I commend the staff it was a pleasant visit for having to be in a ER.  They all did a great, amazing job.< /Text>

<review>Wonderful experience thank you for helping me today with my ear ache

9/26/19 UPDATE so the first time I came here they were really nice medicine was working fine but I got worst , I went back to the corona regional ER  and the doctor or nurse that saw me said that my insurance (medical) didn’t cover a doctor for me to get check and get more details on why my ear was getting worst , that day I went home crying because of my excruciating pain I couldn’t believe they said that to me .. later that night I went to the ARROWHEAD ER IN COLTON CA because I could not take the pain anymore !!!!  And I got admitted to the hospital because my ear infection got very severe and turn into mastoiditis ( the infection spread to my bone) (skull)so I got admitted that night thank god I decided to go to a diferent hospital !!!

<Text>It's difficult to get information about your loved one when they are here.  The nurse's station is pleasant but has little information from the doctor and social worker and you can't get them to call you with information.  My husband is a geriatric patient who needs physical help with daily living and this facility is not set up for that.  He has fallen and they have him signing things he doesn't understand due to his dementia.  This facility may be fine for adults with no physical ailments, but not for geriatric patients.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>In my opinion, if you are sick, if you are hurt, if you need a doctor, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I had been sick for 4 weeks and went to urgent care.  They referred me to the emergency room to get an IV because I was dehydrated. I was weak & had a fever.  Had to get up from my chair to check in, and then sit back down  They wouldn't allow my husband to check in for me.  Had to stand up and then sit to get my vitals taken and then stand up to go back to the waiting room to sit back down.  Had to stand up and walk to the man with the wheelchair so he could take me to get x-rays.  He brought me back to the waiting room where I had to stand up and walk to the chairs in the waiting room.  Had to stand up to get into the wheelchair so they could do a blood draw.  The phlebotomist noticed I was weak and said I should keep the wheelchair.  Thank the Lord!  20 minutes later, a man came out to the waiting room and told me he needed the wheelchair back so I had to stand up AGAIN and sit back down in a chair.  I was called in to see the doctor, so I stood up again to get into another wheelchair.  At this point I could no longer stand up by myself and required assistance from my husband. The doctor stood leaning on the counter, with his arms crossed and legs crossed, insinuated I was FAKING my illness. I was taken back to the waiting room to wait and wait.  I waited for over 4 HOURS.  I finally left because I couldn't sit any longer.  Told the reception desk I was leaving.  The reception desk didn't care. Never heard from the hospital. I did get a bill for almost $4000.00< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I just moved here from Orange County so I had never been here at this facility.   I had an excellent experience.  The ER check in was smooth and efficient.  My care there through the ER and over night was outstanding.  Thank you to the attending Nurses (night I forget her name but was so kind) (Day was Catherine very sweet and attentive) , the lab tec (all of them .....the Ultrasound tech (Cardiology) so informative👍🏼 and the Cardiologist Dr. M Biswas was great 💕. I will continue to see her as my cardiologist even though she is not on my insurance.    Thanks to everyone for the great experience.<//Review>

Oh what can I say is pleasant about corona regional... nothing. I sat in the er for 5 hours last night with a knee injury and can barely walk. Had a dr call me to the back shove my knee to my chin say we need xrays. Sit in the waiting room for an hour and a half get called back for xrays nurse says the doctor will speak with you momentarily about your results.another 3 hours goes by and they call me up to do discharge, never had the results read to me was never offered tylenol or anything for the pain. They come with four ace bandages and say follow up with an orthopedic there is nothing we can do for you here. I will never use this hospital again even if I was an inch from death. I would rather drive 30 to 40 minutes to go to san antonio or arrowhead.</Review>

I'm pacing my hotel room trying to stop the bleeding and I called my insurance.  They sent me to an urgent care that was closed.  I finally called 911 and asked for the nearest hospital and had my driver take me there.

The intake process was rather painless (pun intended) and the staff were all warm and helpful.  Oh, speaking of that... my driver dropped me off at the wrong end of the hospital so the receptionist called someone and a security guard walked all the way over from the ER with a wheel chair to take me all the way back.

All told I was there for a few hours but after all was said and done I left there better than I arrived and educated on what to do from here to recover.  There was even a piece of information I forgot that was told to me so I called back to the hospital and got sent to someone in the ER right away.  The PA that answered my call was, again, very helpful and took the time to answer all of my questions.

The biggest takeaway from this for me is that I feel I can trust these people and that's a big win for me.<//Review><userid>117461102570364951631</userid><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

<Review>We were just there a few days ago July 11th 2019. My wife didnt want to take me there due to all the negative storys we have heard for years! However I felt like I was having a heart attack, so the nearest place is where we went.
Honestly both of us were pleasantly surprise, from beginning to end from very good! Came in, in AFIB was admitted and from the reception to the doctors in ER to the cardiologist and nurses who took care of me while i had to stay were almost a 10 rating! I mean no one is perfect! However I will need surgery and wondering if they even do Cardiac surgery there?< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1563999218499, 'text': 'Hi, Rick.

Let the people speak for themselves, this hospital has more 1 star reviews then 2,3,4,and 5 for a reason... Because 0 or negative isn't an option.

I had one of my children at Corona regional in 2011 and went a few times over the years. Each time was a HORRIBLE experience! Today i went for the absolute last time. The service at this hospital is the worst I have received compared to any other hospital I've been to. They are unprofessional, unwilling, slow wait times and so much more. If you don't believe me, I challenge you to take a trip to this hospital the next time you need a procedure done or emergency services. See for yourself how bad it is. Then again only if you are willing to take that chance with your safety and well-being.<//text>

As a mom I wanted to share that we've visited this hospital twice now w/our grown addict daughter. The entire staff at this particular facility has treated her w/nothing but respect & kindness as others have been nothing but judgemental & cruel. We're here today getting a med. clearance for a rehab. program & I wanted to say thank u so much for continuing to still treat her like a human being.
Thank u for yur passion..

<Text>So disappointed with Corona Regional. The quality of ER doctors is disappointing to say the least. They think they are faith healers and can diagnose you by laying there hands on you and then prescribing you an over the counter medication! Never bothered to listen to my sincere concerns and symptoms that brought me into the ER. Did not even want to run any lab work to find out what is wrong? Why would I pay $$$$ to get a prescription for a $20 med I can buy over the counter! Now I have to see a specialist or
Urgent Care that can help me now that my symptoms have worsened. I should sue this doctor for the hospital fees!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Not happy with service.  In November 2017 I took my daughter to the er be ause she had a deep bite from a dying cat that she was trying to help and was advised to go to er. I had a upper respiratory cold and the guy that checked us in said why dont you see a doctor for your cold I told him I did not want a high bill he asked me what kind of Insurance do you have I told him blue cross ppo.  He said your good.  So my daughter and i were seen. Next thing you know they called us in to get a xray I was refusing and the xray tech said why are you here if you decline service. My reply was I dont want additional  Bill's he said you have good Insurance why you worried about it. I was embarrassed cuz I had my 10 year old crying with a cat bite and I had a upper respiratory infection and everyone was staring at me in the emergency room. So after xray we waited for hours for doctor to see us. Doctor seen me for less than 1 minute I asked for spam prescription he said no just drink plenty of fluids and do saline drops.No treatment for my daughters wound.  Big waste of my time poor customer skills on xray tec, guy at the check in in the er most of all the doctor in the er.  Yes I have good ppo insurance so they billed a enormous fee.  Later I received a seperate bill from the doctor for his whole minute he spent on me and my daughter for $782. Each.  I followed up with blue cross they denied his bill but po ais hospital bill because doctor was not contracted with blue cross.why would they have a doctor that is not contracted work with patients.  So hospital got paid and did not care about their uncontract doctor over billing customer.  Felt very scammed.  Now my good credit went bad due to these 2 seperate Bill's from their subcontracted doctor.  1 minute big bill< /Review>

<name>Karen Anders</name><Date>1450081857974< /Date><rating>4<//rating><review>Yes, they are there for you... when you’re not feeling well... should you end up going to the emergency room.  Just be sure and leave yourself enough time and learn to be a little patient (we all know, and they know, nobody likes to wait; especially when you’re sick or have a sick child) just try to be a little more patient than usual.

The staff always seems, like they like what they do. They are always there for us with a smile and comforting words.  So please don't be that unpleasant inpatient grumpy person that has to vent his or her frustration.  Remember you’re not the only one there that is sick...and we wouldn't want them to take their frustration out on us, would we?

So don't forget to thank them and the Doctors on your way out ...because they truly do care...So they might seem like they keep you waiting but really they are Master Jugglers, they truly care, they greet you with a smile, their words are always comforting, their sincere and eventually they get the job done...even when it's chaotic, sick kids screaming, infants crying, parents complaining because they feel they shouldn't have to wait anymore and they should be put first before anyone else...

So before you say one bad word or complain with your childish outburst...Remember they are there for us, they make us better, their kind, gracious...no doubt underpaid, undervalued, unappreciated and not to mention probably on their third day of a 12 hour or 24 hour shift...

So when you feel that childish temper tantrum filling up inside...Bite your tongue...Be Patient and have a little empathy for what they go through every day and every minute of their job and yes they chose that particular field or profession for us!

Remember...it's not going to kill you to Smile every once in a while, Thank them for a fine job they do... because without them... You Would Still Feel Like Crap!!

So, I just want to thank you all for a job well done!

Sincerely,

Karen  Anders

<Text>Worst hospital ever!!!!

Worst ER experience ever!!! ER staff literally has no sense of urgency or compassion. I just brought my 15 month old son in with a head trauma while I sat for a CT scan in an empty waiting room I finally after almost 2 hours realized I needed to take him to a better hospital and left! Never ever again should anyone trust the life of their loved one to this hospital! They serious have no idea what they are doing!!!< /Text>< gmapID>

The very worst experience ever.  There were a couple of good nurses in Maternity ward, but the rest  were not so good.  They also like to gossip about other patients among themselves.  There service is horrible and not worth the money that is spent there during a visit.  Will be the last time I will ever go to that hospital.....HORRIBLE.....they don't even deserve one star.  Also the ER has a horrible routine.  Could be there hours without being seen, and then when you are, you are sent back out to the waiting room, waiting another hour or two to be called back.  Then have to wait another half hour to an hour to get your prescription to get it filled.  Never have I seen a hospital so sadly run.  You can also tell that the staff doesn't even want to be at work, as they make that plain to see.  I will go elsewhere to seek medical attention rather than go there.<//Text>

<review>My ER experience was HORRIBLE! I got admitted because I was 21 weeks pregnant, all they had to do was a swab and test it yet I was there for 4 hours! I kept telling them I had insurance but I didn't have my card. They said because my insurance is out of state that it will not cover which is a LIE! They also told me the cost of birth which was so irrelevant. I was 21 weeks no where close to giving birth. When I left, I called my insurance to ask for my card number and I called Corona regional and gave them all of my information. About a week later I received a call and they again told me my insurance will not cover but I talked to my Insurance and they said they cover all EMERGENCIES. And the lady's reply was "well since you got admitted and went to labor and delivery it's not considered an ER visit" EVEN THOUGH I WENT TO THE ER. They think they can get over on me just because I'm young and from out of state, WRONG! I will never go here again. All they care about is money. The staff is so unprofessional and I felt uncomfortable here the entire time. Later on that day I went to another ER in Riverside which was so much better. They did what they were supposed to, no problems, and I was only there for an hour. And I also went to labor & delivery and guess what, no problems with my insurance.<//review>< Rating>

I wouldn't send a dying dog here. This hospital is HORRIBLE! The ED rooms are so dirty. My son was bitten in the face by a dog, we were sent to this hospital by ambulance and had to wait 5hrs before being seen. They saw out of control inmates from a jail before a bleeding 10month old. They had nothing stocked for sutures. The ED is run by students. My son was never seen by a Dr just a nursing student and student PA. The nurses were asking EMTs how to do stuff. My son spent 1 week at CHOC hospital because of the lack of care from this hospital. Please aviod this hospital at all costs.</Review>

<Text>If you want to waste your precious time than go to this place. This medical center is very unorganized, and dirty. I brought my mother to ER and their services were very very slow. My mother was suffering very bad with her migraine issue, she was vomiting and with many other pain. They  made her to wait more than 1 hour in waiting room. She was vomiting in waiting room but they did not care at all. Other visitors also got crazy for my mother because all staff were busy in other patient. Once I frustrated with their service and complain to nurse than they took my mother inside the room. In addition, their nurses were very very rude to us. My mother was feeling very cold and I asked one nurse (Chery T.) to turned of air condition and she answered me in very rude way and said NO. They even did not offer a warm blanket to my mother and finally I have to ask for it, as well. Chery T., this old nurse was very rude to us. Moreover, the doctor wanted to discharge my mother soon as possible and I do not know why. My mother still had a lots of pain and she was ready to discharged her. I told her that my mother is not ready to go home and she was feeling very weak so, she need some IV fluids. They give my mother IV fluid after I made a request to doctor. This time I felt smarter than doctor. In addition, their restroom was very very dirty and they need to clean, as well. This medical center staff is unorganized, rude and they talk and laugh back of the room instead of taking care of patient. I WILL NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.< /Text><Rate>1</Rate></record>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Awful. My grandfather had a stroke recently and of course was in ICU. While in there a very unprofessional personel, Eric (Clinical Supervisor sadly) started literally yelling about helping my grandfather and stated it wasn’t his job several times. He had much attitude and aggression and made me uncomfortable about my grandfather being there alone if this is his approach while around family members. He was purposely being demeaning and I’m sure it’s cause I looked young and dumb; I am neither. I’m very disappointed and understand now why the ratings on this hospital are so low. I pretty much had to become his boss and tell him his conduct was poor, he was disrespectful , had a poor attitude, and that he shouldn’t represent his workplace in such a manner (which should not have to be done, especially while I’m concerned for my grandfather). Once asking for his badge information he began to backpedal but it’s just awful how a HOSPITAL employee can be so sorry as a person, when it’s clear what his conduct should be. This is not a taco stand, it’s a hospital and should be conducted as such. He’s just a bully and came across the wrong person that day.  I’ve been calling the past few days for his licensing information but even that’s hard to do as this hospital isn’t going so well because the staff is lazy. Have reported to the joint commission and to higher hospital staff. Get it together CORONA REGIONAL!

But I will give a shoutout to the other staff; Steven in ICU, Justin and Saori on the main floor; for being such great people and enjoying what they do and doing it gracefully. They definitely are rockstars!<//Text>< pics>

Nurse Crystal did a fabulous job of taking care of me and making me feel well taken care of excellent nurse that u have on staff and a blessing to be around nothing but positives here for the positive feeling my family recieved. Another nurse was the surgical admitting and recovery nurses one that stood out with a bright smile was Nurse Mick which is short for her real name but cannot remember it.

This ER used to be great, but now it is the worst facility and I had my worst experience tonight.

I brought in my daughter for having some cough and fever at around 9:00 PM the PA prescribed some Xray and blood work. After an hour of being there they did the Xray and for the blood work the Nurse Loren who was so busy with other patients as well came to draw the blood she pock her once but she couldn't find her vein so she disappeared for another one and have hour. I look around and finlay found her so she came back with a couple of other nurses this time they pock her two times and again they could not find her vein. So after that again they disappeared and now it is 1:30 AM and we are still here and we don't know what is their plan.

It has been the worst night for my poor kid. I made a great mistake coming here.

I recommend anyone who has little kids that this ER is not the right place for your loved ones. I kindly request the hospital authorities to monitor the work of their staffs and deliver good quality services for people.< /text>

Terrible Service and  Extremely Disappointed!  Breast Imaging is very dis-organized. This was the first time I have been here since they moved into the hospital. I stopped going when they were across the street as I was dissatisfied.  I thought I would try again- hoping it would be better- I went to Riverside the last 4 years.   To my dismay- things have not improved at all.  I actually had to wait and check into the hospital waited 45 minutes at 8 in the morning, with only 2 people in front of me, only 1 for breast imaging center.  The girls that check you in at breast imaging were very indifferent and unhelpful.  The girl that did the mammogram was ok, but then I had to go back a few weeks later for an ultrasound and had to go through the same ridiculous check in.  After checking in- i waited 20 minutes and watched the girl who did my ultrasound walk back and forth for those 20 minutes (not with a patient) before finally calling me in.  She did my ultrasound in less than 5 minutes- seemed hasty.  I have had ultrasounds in the past with another imaging center in Riverside and the quality of care treatment I received there was far superior in comparison from Corona.
I will not be coming back, and will let everyone I know that needs a mammogram that this is not a place where a woman or anyone is treated well and with respect.</Text>

The nurses and staff overall were very friendly and they work hard for what they do. However, only reason why I give this hospital a low rating is due to the very disorganized schedule the doctors and receptionists run under each other. I stayed two nights in there for a collapsed lung and it took 5 hours to wait for an open room, which was kind of expected. During my stay, I needed to get some tests done, which took over 5 hours to complete each one that normally takes only an hour to complete and get results. My doctor there (who I won't disclose their name out of respect) claimed that they would make an x-ray appointment to follow-up with my progress. The appointment was never made on record when I returned, and I was told to just walk in and get the x-ray done. When I arrived back, they then stated that you couldn't just walk in and get an x-ray done and needed a doctor's order along with the case, which was a whole lot more pointless running around. So in summary, it's mainly the VERY poor communication and terrible wait times on tests.< /review>

I was at corona hospital a week ago and for my first time there in the ER was terrible. They need to change there procedure its terrible after we signed in they still made us wait like 2 hours and even though my daughter was laying in pain in the bathroom floor and throwing up they still didn't give her a bed. Well in another words there procedure sucks. We were there for 11 hours and every one in the waiting room was complaining about the way they do things. No I wouldn't recommend this hospital for emergency.<//Text>

<Text>My mom (71) recently fell and cracked her head. My brother called me, I recently relocated to Austin, TX and I told him to take her to Corona Regional. He called me very hour with updates and told me the nurses and staff were very nice and good people. I have read many poor reviews and I can only speak on what my mom and brother told me was a very positive experience. I worry about my mom being a widow and me not being close to her but my brother stepped into action and was able to get my mom treated in a timely manner. Thank you Nurses, Doctors & all staff< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I have lived in corona all my 65 yrs. Also born in Corona community hosp. Many changes  have been made thru the years to better serve the residents of corona. I really think they do an outstanding  job. Both of my parents, myself, my grandmother, grandfather and great grandparents have spent time in this hosp. i know there have been times when they were not happy, but when you are in pain who is ? So your going to look for things to complain about. i have personally been a patient four times in the last three years, and think the staff was excellent in every respect.

This person is very ignorant, disrespectful and disqualified. The document that he printed out says that “ Shoulder sprains are treated with a sling or immobilizer.” He refused to give a shoulder sling.

After the X-ray result came out, had to wait 45-50 minutes before he decided to come out and discuss the results with me in the hallway!

Very unprofessional and disappointed at the service and way they handle patients.

It’s sad that I live in Corona and only have this hospital. I guess will be going to Riverside for any future ER visits.<//Text>< Pics>

Brought my 5 month old here for cough and eye infection, against my better judgement to make the drive to CHOC instead. They called her in quickly, but seemed to be in a rush to get us out. She was diagnosed with Conjunctivitis, but Doctor didn't check her cough. When I mentioned her cough, she just waved her hand in the air and said that it was a normal cough and it would go away. Well, it got worse! She couldn't sleep that night for coughing so much. Took her to her Pediatrician the very next day, and she says baby has Bronchiolitis! Do not go to this ER, take the drive to CHOC. Corona Regional has the worst ER staff ever!!!<//Text>

Years ago I came here and it was bad... dirty, unprofessional, rude staff and several misdiagnoses. I also recall in the late 90's a young woman sitting outside crying because they had just butchered her "female parts" then later found out it was not necessary basically destroying her chance at having children. Horrible, YES but I figured they would have been better by now and be able to handle simple things....right? WRONG!

Skip to present day...

Horrible hospital. I went in for what I didn't know at the time, was a tooth infection and an ear infection. I was told at this hospital to basically take some ibuprofen and go home. The doctor wouldn't do anything, and after going to a different hospital and being treated for the problem that I had, I was told that this hospital was probably scared to give me anything there or a prescription for pain medication because I guess druggies use these types of medications to get a buzz on and so the doctors are scared to treat pain, or labeled me as some type of junkie. Anyways, after going to a different hospital, I was treated with an antibiotic for the infection, and also treated for pain as I hadn't slept in a few days, and was sent home with two prescriptions and also instructions to follow up with my dentist, which I have done. Oh, I almost forgot the best part...the doctor said and I quote (cutting out the profanity for the review's sake) "Hey man what I would do is avoid the bulls**t and just go to Mexico! I mean that's where I get my drugs and they can't be that bad, right?! I mean if they were they wouldn't be in business! Just take a couple hour drive get your tooth worked on and they will help you out. A lot cheaper than here in the States". So... basically I come to you for help and you tell me to "go get my drugs" and "get my tooth fixed" in Mexico?! What the heck kind of medical advice is this...I mean I am not a doctor, but I doubt this is part of medical training!</Review>

<name>Cheryl Torres< /name><Date>1490060090316<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>I was extremely disappointed and upset with the care my 80 year old mother received at this hospital. Nurses were kind, but that could not make up for the fact that there was no communication between the doctor and staff. My mother had to wait for 24 hours to receive a procedure that literally takes five minutes. Over that 24 hour time period, She  was never informed when the doctor was coming. Staff just kept saying," we're waiting to hear from the doctor."  It took almost 24 hours for anyone to actually hear from the doctor. When we did finally see the doctor, he was arrogant and condescending. We were dumbfounded by his attitude.  The only reason I am not disclosing his name is because I have other family members who have seen this doctor and they say he was very good, kind and nice. Maybe he was having a bad day, but my 80 year old mother deserves better care than she received at  Corona Regional Medical Center.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I was taken to the ER by an ambulance because of a severe pain in my lower left side of my body on Monday at 6 AM. I immediately got a room in the ER. In the ambulance, I was already injected morphine. When I got to the ER, they checked my vitals immediately. After a couple of hours of waiting, the ER doctor visited me and they did several tests. They were Urine, Blood, Abdominal CT scan, and Testicular tests. I was diagnosed with two kidney stones in my left Kidney and Ureter. I was discharged from the hospital around 1 PM. In overall, they did a great job and I was very happy with the service I received. I thank them and I appreciate their hard work.< /review>

I had a horrible experience at this hospital doctors try to diagnose me with something that wasn’t even remotely close to what I have they kept me there and try to give me medications that I refused to take without a consultation<//review>

So I really hate leaving a negative review here because my nursing staff and the PA who saw me in the ER were wonderful. The tech who gave me my CT scan was one of the most pleasant hospital workers Ive ever met and he was so great about calming my nerves. So please know from the start that the actual medical staff was lovely despite a full and busy ER and THEY get five stars.. My problem with Corona Regional is in how they handled addressing me about my Co-Pay. I am happy to pay my bills and NEVER pay them late (I knew ahead of time what the amount of my Co-Pay would be even so no issues there).  Before leaving I asked about my co-pay and they said I would receive the bill later after the insurance approves their end. Fair enough. THE DAY AFTER getting out of the ER with some serious issues I get a phone call trying to get me to pay my bill immediately (less than 24 hours) and over the phone. This felt unusual to me as I've never had a hospital do this especially so soon after leaving. You either pay at the hospital (which I tired to do) or you wait to receive a bill. Thats always been customary. I will not give my credit card info over the phone, just wont. So I asked the lady if they would send me a bill statement in the mail like EVERY other hospital Ive ever been to has, OR if they have an option to do bill pay online because I dont give my info over the phone. She blatantly told me the hospital does neither and I either need to pay on the phone or come BACK to the hospital in person to pay it. Today I popped onto their website and lo and behold, theres an online bill pay option AND in order to do this route, you need to first receive your bill in the mail to get your account number. So I was blatantly lied to on both accounts and was told I need to come back to the hospital while having internal bleeding to pay my bill. You CANNOT go around being blatantly dishonest about our options to pay our medical bills. I know MANY people that would never give card info to someone they dont know over the phone. This really made me angry enough to leave a negative review which I seldom do, because blatant dishonesty and mishandling billing are two big issues from any professional establishment. So no, I will not be coming to the hospital with intestinal bleeding to pay my bill, I will wait until I receive my statement in the mail as is customary. I also asked the lady what my deadline is for paying the bill and she wouldnt give me an answer on that either. "Well we would like to get payment now". Yeah, don't we all? But every bill you'll ever receive has a deadline no? Its a pretty direct and reasonable question to know how long I have to heal and rest before you make me drive over there. Pretty sketchy to me.< /text>

When u walk in to a hospital and feel judgement when your in a state of mind that your ill and in severe pain it hurts to know the doctor helping you decided to place judgement and not treat you as an individual and he as a professional.  I'm saddened that since I couldn't speak well due to a swollen throat that he was easy to dismiss me without diagnosis.< /text>

DO NOT GO HERE ! Came in at 8 with extreme abdominal pain. They took me back right away, took blood and urine, and gave me some pain meds. Doctor comes in 4 hours later saying I have a UTI. I explained to her that I have had UTIs in the past and don't have a SINGLE symptom of that. She said "well that's what I THINK it is, I can't think of anything else it could be" then proceeds to tell me that there is no bacteria in my urine, but that's the only thing she thinks it could be. I tried to explain to her again that I don't have a single UTI symptom and she ended the conversation with "okay so I'll write you a prescription for antibiotics for your UTI" then left. I waited for 4 hours to have someone tell me something that I don't have. Discharged me with antibiotics and ibuprofen. Thanks for nothing Doc ! 😑< /text>

Hospital was up to date and impeccably clean. Came to deliver my 5th baby, which I was actually alone. My labor was fast only 4 hours of a minimal amount of pitocin. I chose to come in when i was 5cm since my labors are so fast, I didn't want to have the baby at home. All the medical decisions were decided with me and my nurse Amy, who was awesome. She kept things quite, brought me whatever i needed. She was there the whole time thankfully. Amy and the doctor never made medical decisions for me, instead they discussed what they were going to do before they did anything (starting pitocin, breaking my water, etc). She brought me a peanut pillow for my knees, which was amazing! I declined any vaginal exams after the water was broken, and they respected my wishes! The hospital even let me eat in labor, which no hospital has ever before (jello, popsicles, broth etc.) The nurse even caught the baby, he came so fast! She also let the cord pulsate for 5 minuets. My OBGYN did go home since it was 7 pm, but another doctor came in and handled my hemorrhage and stitches quickly without any incident. I was worried about the reviews, but only negative is since its a small hospital the maternity ward is right next to the regular rooms. Great experience and i highly recommend!</Text>

<rate>2<//rate><text>I had to take my father in the ER because he had a fever and turned all white. When I got there the first thing I noticed was the night guard was very helpful and nice to everyone that had walked through that door. My father had to wzit a little but as soon as the nurse got his vitals they immediately took him to the back room and gave him an IV with antibiotics later I found that he had some kind of blood infection and the next day they said he got pneumonia now he's there for a few days now and so far the staff is taking good care of him and depending how the treatment and the out come is ill revise this review and rating accordingly.....ok after my dad had felt better they still wanted to keep him there for another day even the nurse said he was fine and all the test were good. The doctors made it seem like he was terribly ill but with what I've seen and notice all they want is more of the insurance money. I don't want to keep going on and on so my final opinion of this hospital would be negative. If you can't avoid going there, get your loved ones stable and have them transfer them out to a better facilities bright side some of the nurses were very nice.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is a horrible hospital. I was brought with severe kidney stones and after a several hour wait in the very dirty ER I was admitted to the hospital for 2 days.  I was told they were full so I was put in a two person room that had 4 beds in it.  Our toilet was broken, our room had no AC and it was very hot.  We were all begging for fans and they were never brought.  Our sink in the bathroom had only hot water so we had to use a bathroom out in the hall.  When a nurse finally noticed one of the guys in the room using the other bathroom, she came in and yelled at us and told us that we could only use our own.  Half the time we could not get to the bathroom because the person next to me had a bed up 2 feet away from the door and his family was there sitting in the aisle so we could not get to it.  Of course he could speak no english.  one of the nurses even apologized for us being crammed in the small room.  The billing dept came in to talk to the guy next to me who had just had an appendectomy, had not health insurance.  She offered him a 50% discount if they started making payments.  He said that he had no insurance or money and that they were not going to be paying the bill.  Then she came to me and quoted me the amount of $ I was going to owe after my insurance payment.  But when the bill came it was more than double the amount I was told it was going to be.  Even though we were treated so poorly and were very miserable during the stay.  I will never go here again!<//Text>

Worst parking ever, doctors or reserved have all the parking filled around the ER. If you have an emergency take an Uber or you will have to park a block or more away and walk to the ER. 2 am and I am carrying my sick 4 year old down the dark cold street to the so called new and fantastic ER.< /text>

<Review>Came into the emergency room for a family member and they had trash all over the floor and a syringe dropped on the floor. Coming from a medical background this is disgusting and displeasing for family members to walk into. I cleaned it myself because I would never let a patient see that. Doctors and nurses took so long to see us because doctor was too busy walking up and down the hall flirting with the nurses. All they care about is money the case manager seemed to only be concerned about that.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1526050009731, 'text': 'Hi, Alyssa.

<text>I'm very upset with this hospital. We were treated horribly. Staff moved my Grandmother's room without telling us and this nurse with the worst attitude started moving my personal belongings without my authorization and I asked her to stop. This new room where my mom was moved had 3 patients and no space to move around. It was awful  how we were treated by this hospital staff. I STRONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE... AND THEN...... she was in ER for more than 10 hours weating for a room...</text>< resp>

<Text>I used to work there and one of my friends was a patient there.  I can share details on their  OR department management since I know someone there pretty well.  The OR manager is really  incompetent and just be there for paychecks.  Here is the rundown on problems in OR 1)  Management: - incompetent manager who doesn’t know how to manage, harass/threaten staff, lazy, give no support to good staff, bias, keep hiring bad (unprofessional) candidates, high turnover, didn’t/won’t  keep good staff/nurse, bias (unfair treatment and favor certain bad employees), lack of enforcing (safety) standards, allowing staff do use whatever (bad) techniques, poor supervision and support,  hazardous OR environment due to lack of safety standards and procedures, bad team work,  a lot of (cheap) talk but no good actions followed,  bad resource planning/scheduling effecting services provided to surgeons and patients, allowing bad staff with rude attitude to work without probation or punishment.  HR dept is also not doing their job and simply there to protect management when employees file complaints.
All of these problem with OR manage resulted in poor and slow services.
My recommendation will be 1) fire OR management and replace with competent and professional manager,  2) audit the department and interview employees not just manager, 2) improve benefit packages in order to retain and attract qualified and good staff.   If I am a patient who needs  a major surgery, DON’T  go there until (new management and standards) situation improved.   I must say though many nurses there are great and very nice. They deserve  better management and good competent/friendly staff.</Text>< name>

<Text>NEVER go to this hospital!!!! My grandfather passed away at this hospital a few months ago after going into cardiac arrest on the operating table. They never even got his medical records from his other hospital and had no idea that he had a NO RESUSITATION ORDER and they revived him and put him on life support.. His body was badly bruised everywhere and theu did a piss poor job of wrapping his injuries and just hooked him to life support and put him in a room for my family to say goodbye.. My mother is filing a law suit for negligence.. SO HORRIFYING!!! Plus Ive never in my life seen a ER so dirty or disorganized! Never again!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I was here last year for ruptured ovarian cyst,  spent 12 hours here and about 6 of me screaming from the pain before they even have me something for pain,  never saw a doctor then they sent me home.  Giving it a second chance today my husband has all the symptoms of appendicitis been here over 2 hours and  all they did was take his vitals,  the make nurse in the front was so rude the whole time.  This place needs better administration !<//review>

<Text>I just called seeking for help regarding my 9 month old daughter. Before i can say another word to the operator she transferred me to another woman i believe in emergency. I told her what my daughters situation was & she was so rude to me. As a first time mom i wanted to callbefore rushing in for nothing major,but its a shame i had to deal with her. I asked her for her name and she answered me rudely responding no. I have never been to this hospital & now i never will. 1:10am</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Here with my mom since 12 today. Supposedly no beds available so kicked to the waiting room with general sick population. Dr and nurses have been less than communicative or friendly. Not just with us but other patients as well.  And when they dothey talk to them in front if everyone. Nothing like spilling  private medical business out there with the rest of the folks.

They have forgotten we are people and don't care for their patients anymore they way they should and don't follow through ! Example on two separate occasions I was given heavy medication and asked to wait in the waiting room for hours uncomfortable and in pain so when they called my name they couldn't find me or put a face to the name and skipped over me because I was dazzed and un able to care for myself .  Then I couldn't get ahold of someone to pick me at 4. Am mind u they gave me medication 20 mins before and discharged me after they told me I couldn't get a taxi voucher I had to 20 min walk home medicated and at 4 am when your suffering and looking for help they are not the hospital to call ! It's sad this is the closest hospital to me !</Text>

If I could give no stars I would.  I was seen by a female nurse named Toni a PA named Johnathan W Brummond and Dr named Kurt Mueller.  I went in at the advice of my pain management doctor do to a probable spinal headache.  The triage nurse was nice and got me straight to a bed about the only god thing I can say.  I got hooked to monitors but had to ask several times for a bag to vomit in.  It took a long time to get an IV placed and blood drawn.  My pain management doctor wanted a blood patch and it was mentioned when I got to the ER at 9:26 am I got 2 rounds of pain medication and 3 rounds of zofran to no affect my blood work was not done til 1:30 pm my MRI was not performed until 4:18 pm.  I was discharged at 5:17 pm with absolutely no pain relief.  The Dr did take my pain management Dr's information but never confirmed he talked to him.  I was told that because the IV pain medication did not work and it was not life threatening even though my MRI showed fluid leakage to wait until Monday and hope my pain management Dr could see me.  He did not send me home with anything but zofran for nausea and I was still crying in pain he did not do a blood patch or care that I still could not sit up or stand.  This was Friday it is now Sunday I still can only lay down and sit up for short periods of time before the throbbing and nausea come back.  I am extremely dissatisfied with all of the staffs bedside manner I am upset I was not told there was a leak and I had to read it in the report I had to ask for I am  upset they did not do a blood patch which would have fixed my pain.  Strongly recommend any other hospital.< /text>

Came in to ER AND THEY WANTED ME TO  stay 2 days for observation yet they had no beds. I never saw a doctor in 8 hours there. UNBELIEVABLE. I could have died there and they wouldn't have even noticed.  Worse experience at a hospital ever.</Review>

<review>Worst hospital ever!!! I just went here tonight and had my name called 4 times for different reasons. First I was triaged, then for the lab, then for my insurance paperwork, then again by somebody from the lab AGAIN they didn't know that my blood was already drawn and finally from the doctor! I was taken to a triage room and seen by the doctor. He could see that  I was in pain. I was almost crying. Having a history with diverticulitis I was pressed on and sent back to wait. I was told that I had to wait for a bed until my CT Scan comes back. WTH?! Won't I be discharged by then? I had other serious symptoms and they refused me a bed. The doctor said that he was going to give me Norco for pain. Even after telling him that I have had hospitalizations in the past for the same reason. The nurses ignored me even as I cried. I asked for my pain medicine and they told me oh yes you are next to get your pain meds. It was 20 minutes later and nothing. I walked out! I have never been treated like this before. I will never ever go back!!!</review>< Pics>

my review is just for the ER

after running EVERY test under the sun (we have great insurance so i think they wanted to run up the tab) and spending over 7 hours in this old, poorly designed hospital my husband was misdiagnosed

how do i know that? we only went to the ER because it was in the middle of the night and the ambulance took him there.  his primary MD is with St. Jude's hospital.

the following day we went to his primary physician with the x rays,copy of CT scan and blood tests and found out that he was prescribed the wrong meds.

the nurses and doctors are overwhelmed at Corona Regional Medical ER.  their equipment is out of date and just old and rundown.
Needless to say we will not be returning.  I will opt to drive into Orange County for medical attention~it would have been faster and less stressful.

i believe if this city were to build a nice new hospital we would get better doctors in Corona.<//Text>

<review>Possibly the worst of the worst hospitals ever! The times I've brought my daughters here, the nurses that take temperature and blood pressure are always saying stupid comments. For example: oh she doesn't look like she's in pain, or the latest one today, she looks fine for someone who has fever. Like wow! The ER was super packed. I understand it happens, but after an hour in a half we were finally called. Only for them to ask us To go back to the waiting room. This happens like 3 different times. It was over 2 hours waiting to get our prescription and discharge papers and we gave up!!! We left along with like 3 different families who were there waiting. This is pathetic! Never EVER AGAIN! God forbid we ever have to go back! 😡 P.s funny how they did take our insurance card after not even 10 minutes walking in. Haha< /review>< userid>

<Review>I've heard a lot of bad reviews about this hospital but I can honestly say this was the best hospital I've been to. I went in for a spinal fusion surgery and when I got out of surgery I had the sweetest lady named Jeneanne take care of me! My drain fell out of my back and it leaked all over my bed pad and she cleaned me up as well as my bedding which wasn't her job at all! So sweet! I had the best CNA her name was savannah! She was the sweetest girl who got me extra saltines because that's all I could eat haha! She comforted me and made sure at all times I was okay. My first time up and walking she said " aww you look so beautiful great job" it gave me so much encouragement! I would actually be friends with her that's how great she was! Everyone who took care of me seemed like they were run by a very responsible organized hospital. I was blessed to make it through surgery and have met the people I did ! Thank you so much for everything you all did to make my life worth living again! The pain I was in was unimaginable and with your help I've been better!<//Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><pics>None<//pics><text>Here's a long story about my trip to the E.R. if you don't feel like reading it's all good. Enjoy your day 😊

Yesterday at work I was standing at the register and all of a sudden it felt like someone stabbed me next to my right hip and I almost started crying (didn't though because I'm somewhat professional and yeah.) so I complained about it slightly thinking maybe I pulled a muscle somehow. Then the pain started getting more intense as the night went on I realized that it wasn't my hip and probably something more extreme. So I was in the back cutting mushrooms and the most excruciating pain came to me and I felt like I was going to pass out because of it. So I told the other manager I was going to have to leave and that I was going to try to tough it out until 11 and finish closing (it was about 9:30) they didn't let me.

Fast forward I went to the E.R and there was maybe 10 other people in there. No big deal, but then a lot of red flags popped up.
1. The lady who took my insurance information yelled at me because as I thought I was dying I didn't think to grab my ID.
2. It took them over 3 hours just to get my height and weight (again, not angry about this. Usually this happens but I get pulled to the back right away)
3. Every test I took there was at least 3-4 hour gap in between them and I didn't get my results until 5:30 this morning. There reasoning is "it just got in"
4. I told them I was in an intense amount of pain and that walking, sitting and standing hurts. Every time they needed to ask me, this is the funny part get ready, what was wrong with me at the receptionist desk they made me get up and walk over. As I'm crying and limping over they just stare and say "you've been over there for a while, we just wanted to make sure you're checked in"
5. After 6 or 7 hours they finally gave me pain medication and when I had asked about it, because I don't take medication and I like to know what's going into my body, the lady just repeated the name rolled her eyes and gave it to me. Which caused me to fall over in pain and actually scream it was that intense. But she walked back to her computer and told me to go back to the lobby.

The only reasons why anything happened is because I actually went to the front desk asked for water and actually said "I have been here for over 5 hours, if I drink water now I can guarantee that I'll be fine if anything bad was to happen anyway. Since yknow IM NOT GETTING ANY HELP." Then the nurse was like "yknow you results are in let me go get the doctor"

This man was the rudest human being I have ever had the pleasure speaking with. I'll just quote what hey said because I'm actually super angry.
"The only strange thing about our urine is...*looks at nurse*never mind its fine *looks st the door*"
"We found excess fluids somewhere"
"There might be something wrong, but our one scan can't find it soooo..."

This point I yelled because it was 4 am and I just wanted either a bed, a release form because nothing was happening,  or to actually pass out in pain hoping they'd actually do something.  I called them out on the lack of communication, not answering my questions, the lack of decency in this hospital.

Also, while they took my blood my hands started turning blue. The nurse man made a comment that it wasn't normal but sent me to the lobby anyway. I asked my mom, she said maybe I was just cold. They were blue for maybe 2 hours.

At about 6-7 I was pulled back to the back and this new lady came in and was telling me things that we're never mentioned by the other doctor. Stating "it's pretty obvious this could be the problem" and then didn't explain anything just sent me home. When I asked questions she got extremely defensive and kept stating "well I jut got here so what happened before me is none of my business."

There's more to this and I'm probably missing key factors</text><gmap_id>0x80dcc80de8426db3:0xbe7434dc33116382< /gmap_id><time>1497491063256<//time></record></dataset><record>

This is one of the worst hospitals I have ever seen. Staff is rude and unprofessional. My mom has been there several times and each time has been treated poorly. They kept her in the er for 12 hrs because "there are no beds available" and never offered to get her something to eat or drink. They gave her her meds which require food. She nicked her leg on the wheelchair and all they did was put a bandaid on it. Didn't clean it at all. She's a chemo patient and very susepital to infection. Unfortunately since this is the only hospital in corona we have no choice but to take her there. And don't even get me started on the Dr's on staff. I don't know how to spell there names or I'd include them in this also</Text>

<text>I was discharged last night and I informed the caseworker that I had had the issue I am dealing with 7 times now and that crutches were not going to be a good thing for me because of previous experiences and penny my caseworker blew me off and she even told me I had to make it work in my head I’m telling myself is this really happening right now I explain to her that I needed a knee crutch brace because previously of the now 7 times I’ve had this re-injured heel I use the regular crutches and that my pic line was either kinked I.V or moved out of place I had got out of the transportation vehicle last night around 10:30pm I crutched myself from my driveway to my room and I had set up to take a shower and then I looked at my I.V site and I had noticed that my pic line was pulled out of where it is supposed to be a I was only home for not even a hour now I find myself going back to the hospital im probably going to have to be re-admitted to have my pic line replaced even after calling it that this would happen to me and the caseworker assuring me that It’s impossible for my pic line to come out of its position but yet it is out of place I’ve contacted my primary care doctor who is very unhappy with my current situation I was also told very I’m professional that I could either go home with crutches or go home with nothing at all I have asked them for a simple knee crutch to rest my knee and that way I don’t break my heel bone and the caseworkers made me feel that a simple brace that I want was such an impossibility to acquire I had built such a great relationship with the medical staff at this hospital because I had been going there for some many years but I guess I was wrong<//text>< pics>

<pictures>None<//pictures>< Review>
My poor boyfriend's stay in here was really quite crazy.  I hope the condition of the er improves with the expansion they are working on.  It was very dirty when we were there.  There was dried blood everywhere we looked. Old bandage wrappers and plastic needle caps all over the floor and a bunch of bandage wrappers were shoved into the area between the bed and rail of the stretcher he was put on.

He was admitted after 7 hours of waiting in triage,  knowing he was to be admitted.  There was one nurse trying to tell the triage nurse that we would have to sit with my boyfriend in pain and hooked up to an iv,  in the waiting room until a bed opened up.

Finally they got him to his room,  only to find all the beds were missing.  When a new one was found for him,  they assigned him a nurse.  His first nurse was a neglectful nightmare.  We had to call the charge nurse for help,  because she left him in pain for 4 hours while pretending like she was "waiting for further instructions".  All he had asked for was motrin... Once that woman was gone,  all of the other caregivers were pretty attentive and nice.

We also found a lot of dried blood around his room,  on the sheets they brought to cover him and actually balled up on a bloody tissue (that was left in the toilet paper dispensor).  Pictures posted for reference.

Then at the end of this whole crap show... He gets a nearly $3k bill,  on top of all of the other hospital stay bills and testing bills (a total of which comes to over $6k... And he was insured + in network)  and this bill is for one of the doctors who literally only said hello to him while he was in the ER for 6 hours straight and then left.... But that doctor was apparently "out of network".  The doctor didn't so much as take his temperature.  Just walked in the room,  hello and left.

The whole reason we had to wait for 7 hours in that filthy er was for him to get admitted... And the doctor did absolutely nothing to help with that and had the greatest audacity to bill him for $2,500.....the doctor who did test and admit him came waaaay later than hello/goodbye guy did.... Why are we even being billed for this crap?

no one in the billing office will help my boyfriend and one of the phone workers even yelled at him and told him the doctor was a private contractor and next time he (my boyfriend) goes to the er,  to ask every doctor who comes near him if they are in network first..... How about we never come to your POS hospital again, instead?

Also... His diagnosis was incorrect.  We got a 2nd opinion of his xrays and the gastro specialist who wont stop sending us bills managed to overlook the visible tears in his colin and called it a lesser issue and not to be concerned about... Which is 100% wrong and now he needs a Colonoscopy before he even turns 30. Good thing that doctor just retired.....

In summary : I would rather go to riverside regional over this place and plan to,  next time either of us is in need of emergency care.</Review>

This is a good hospital... I had a bad experience once with a staff person I reported to an other person and they send someone to make a report .. I had 3 of my kids there and now I'm going for my 4th.. Now that I go back after 7yr..I se nothing but good changes ... On ER they have better personal that treats you with respect ..I feel sorry for those who had bad experience  but that's why you have to report the incidents they won't do nothing but good changes ...👍👍👏
Thank you yo all the good staff..

I brought my son in. He had shortness of breath and severe abdominal pain. He had lost 12 lbs, was extremely fatigued, and was excessively thirsty. we didn't know at the time, but he is a type 1 diabetic and was in diabetic ketoacidosis. He had all the symptoms on the list. His life was in danger. Should of been an easy diagnosis with a finger prick and a sugar rest. Well they didn't rest anything, the dr didn't recognize what was going in, and sent us away with some Pepcid. It was almost 36 hours later when I took him to his pediatrician who immediately sent us to chino hospital where it was discovered that his blood sugar was nearly 400 and he was in the stages of death. We ended up being sent by ambulance to the pediatric intensive care unit of Loma Linda's children's hospital. Don't go to Corona hospital unless you want to take a chance on dying!!!< /text>

<text>This is by far the WORST medical facility with the most careless employees... the nurses are rude and the doctors are so careless for their patients in the ER.   The first time, we took my mother and she had a blood cloth on her leg due a hormonal therapy she had been taking for cancer.  The Hospital performed a fake ultrasound and said nothing was wrong with her and told her to go home after 12 long hours of pain and agony...The doctors there stated there was nothing they could do for her at all because they don't touch cancer patients.  We immediately took her to St Jude's Hospital where they found two blood cloths and luckly they were able to save her leg.  Then my father this past Friday September 22, went in because his caterer came out and his dialysis doctor advice him to go to the ER and he contacted Corona Regional to let them know of his condition and to put the caterer back in.  My father was bleeding and they kept him for over 5 hours just sitting in the waiting room because they didn't have any place for him and after a very long time the negligent doctor stated that they wanted for his doctor to call them even though he had already done since he asked him to go in.  The doctor said "have him call us again because we need to ask him what we should do"...my father was still bleeding and just I suggested to go to St Jude's hospital even though it's about 20 miles away from him because I knew this was an urgent matter and as oppose as Corona Regional, St Jude's Hospital actually cares for human beings and treated my father immediately as it was an urgent matter with in 2 hours.  I honestly don't understand how this place is open they need to shut them down or fire all the careless staff starting with the careless, good for nothing doctors and idiotic, rude, good for nothing so call nurses.  It's obvious that they don't care for anyone, they have no organization and it's all filthy.  I hope they shut them down because they deserve that or worst!!!< /text>< pics>

<text>The wait was an hour and a half just be seen while I moaned I  a corner as my appendix threatened to burst. I finally made it back and they did blood work and I sat in a room with 3 other people for another hour until they did a ct scan. Then another 2 hours before they came back. It was miserable and the nurses made it very clear that they were actually unusually slow. The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because they have a brand new very clean facility and most of the people who helped me were very friendly.<//text></record>

I cant even explain the extent and detail of how they took care of me. And just a comment for most of you out there lay off the pain meds, i would say 50% of patients in ER are only there to get a high off pain meds, there the ones holding up the line to have people taken care of with real problems.<//text>

Nasty. Aside from other problems I could not believe they did not have showers in the Bathroom. In the 3 days my husband was there: No one asked him if he needed a shower or a sponge bath. Come on what kind of a hospital it is that does not have showers in the bathroom?<//Review>

They have no sense of customer services. They are rude and nurses are ignorant to peoples needs. The people in the ER do not care about the people or how they are feeling. They show no empathy--flat out rude!<//Text>

This place is ridiculous been sitting in the emergency room now for five hours watching the staff play around with each other ,going outside to take personal calls and ignoring everyone in the waiting room and giving people the run around when they ask a question , since it seems like an inconvenience to the staff because it interrupts their play time with other staff members is this a hospital or romper room?????< /Review>
