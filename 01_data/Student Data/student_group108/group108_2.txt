<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I love this office. Everyone is very kind and they are great with the kids. Exams seem thorough. I am giving them 4 stars cause unfortunately they have decided to remove Principal and only fully take Delta Dental. I went from 100% coverage to 80% giving me a $200 dollar bill for my two children today for routine items. I may need to find a new office now, unfortunately. The cost is too high now.< /Text>< pics>

LOVE all the staff and how they give the kids such amazing attention. They are always so helpful and sweet! The first few appointments were not easy when the kids were little but the staff was so patient and the girls warmed up quickly.<//review>

We have been coming to Pediatric smiles for 9 years. We love Dr Tsai and the technicians. Our son is autistic and has a difficult time with the dentist and doctor and they are beyond understanding when he has a challenging time, giving him so much compassion and patience.< /Review>

<Text>Love Carlsbadds for my kids’ dental needs! We’ve been coming here since we moved to Carlsbad 5 years ago— we always have an awesome hygienists and the front office staff are fantastic! They coordinate with the kids’ orthodontist and keep up on insurance issues. The best part: Dr. Judy. She is the sweetest, smartest, best dentist ever! Can’t imagine going anywhere else.< /Text>< Pictures>

Where do I start... this place is amazing.
I was dreading bringing my two-year-old for the first time as she does not do well with other people, but to my surprise she was very calm did not cry at all and the assistant was very gentle with her and very nice.  My six-year-old did very well here too! So happy I switched from the super dentist.Now our dental visits are stress-free! By far best pediatrics dentist experience we’ve had.< /Text>

We have been coming here for about 4 years and we absolutely love it! Very clean, staff is very friendly and very informative.  The kids love the TV’s on the top and keeps them occupied.  Unfortunately they did go out-of-network for my insurance, but after discussion with my spouse, we decided we would rather pay out of pocket for a service we trust and know his high quality than somewhere else where we may not get the same level of care.<//Text>

My kids started off here at ages 3 5 6 and are now 16 19 20. My son still wont go anywhere else. They are all so sweet and helpful and always have the best smiles and attitudes. I never have to worry about anything because they do all the hard work and make it look flawless while they do it. Top notch! Always clean and spotless.<//text>

The front staff is amazing and very kind. Dr. Brown and James with Dr. Tsai have been taking care of my 2 kids since they were very young like 2. My kids are now 10 and 13. I’m so grateful because they leave you feeling like your part of their family. I can’t imagine ever taking them anywhere else. They are so fabulous with young kids. They offered sealants and I had never heard of it which has made such a difference in protecting their young teeth. I have referred lots of friends and family who love it too.<//Review>

CarlsbaDDS Pediatric Smiles is such a great place for the kiddos. They do everything they can to make the Dentist fun and enjoyable.
Even when it comes to filings.
They also make you feel safe during this pandemic, keeping things clean and staff and having strict protocols.</Review>

Seeing your child bleeding is awful, but we left this place with a paw patrol medal and all smiles. They are fantastic and I’d recommend them

<pics>None<//pics><review>Excellent all the way around. Beginning with cleanliness of the office. It is very obvious that the staff take the necessary preventative measures of keeping their patients safe from Covid exposure by how well managed they have their appointments set up and how well they keep everything so clean. Everyone is so kind and respectful. We’ve been going there for 6 years and in all the time we have never encountered anyone with a bad attitude or given bad service. We are so extremely happy going to see Dr. Tsai and all her staff. Thank you everyone for making our daughter’s visits such a positive and happy experience at the dentist office.< /review>< user_id>

My son needed a lot of work done and I wanted a second opinion so I started bring my child here. He loves it! They are very welcoming and professional. All the Drs are awesome especially Dr. Tsai. They use positive reinforcement, songs and will "nickname" all their equipment so kids can feel safe. My 3 year old has had cleanings, fillings, and crowns done here and they know exactly how much your child can take and will stop if they feel uncomfortable. They get to pick a toy, stickers, balloons or lollipops (sugar free).< /review>

<text>This entire office is so kind and patient. My daughter had panic attacks about getting her tooth extracted. This office put on her favorite movie, told her she could bring in her favorite stuffed animal to hold, let me hold her hand the entire time and went at her pace. Dr. Tsai took over an hour in our room to finish at our pace. I am so very grateful for her patience. My daughter is all smiles about the experience. Nothing but good things to say about this office. Thank you all!< /text><user_id>102529741306778521798<//user_id><Time>1610509491269</Time>< Pics>

My older 5 children, then aged 4 to 14, first got to know Dr. Tsai 10 years ago when we lived in Carlsbad. They all saw Dr. Tsai and we were quite happy with our pediatric dental care. We moved to WA shortly after Dr. Tsai opened her new office and lived in WA for nearly 10 years before moving back to CA in 2020 with 3 more children:  my 10-year old son and twin 7-year-old girls. When we moved back, we landed in Carmel Valley some distance away from our old familiar Carlsbad areas.  I have to admit I had not found a pediatric dentist in Carmel Valley yet, even though my kids were past due for their regular check-ups and hygiene. But when there are no problems,  time gets by ...!!  Until ... Christmas Day, when one of my 7-year-old girls, Aubrey, fell and broke both her front teeth off very badly.  Not just a chip but broken off in a big ‘V’ all the way up; about half of each tooth broken off.  It was Christmas Day and no dentists were open!  We all got down on hands and knees and found both pieces of her teeth. We looked up on internet how best to preserve them and hoped for the best until we could take her in.  Very luckily, the teeth breaks were not down to her root so she was not in any pain.

After trying to get in with other dentists in the CV area (no one was even opening up again until January 4th!), I was worried that too many days were passing .  I finally looked up Dr. Tsai and they got Aubrey in immediately, even for a Saturday appointment. I had been told that the broken tooth fragments could not be used and was so disappointed but saved them anyway.  Good thing!  Because Dr. Tsai told me they could be used!  By Monday, we took the two tooth fragments in and Dr. Tsai was able to place them perfectly back onto each broken tooth.  Dr.Tsai was so careful and conscientious matching each piece up exactly!  Even the bonding color that she chose is, to my view, precisely perfect— an exact match to Aubrey’s teeth color. This repair work could not possibly look better; it is the best it could possibly look, no question.  I am so pleased!

Dr. Tsai’s assistant, Jessica, was completely in sync with Dr. Tsai during the whole procedure.  They worked together as a fine-tuned machine, delicately and precisely matching each of two tooth fragments back in Aubrey’s mouth to bond back to her two front teeth.  In addition, they were both so kind and gentle with Aubrey, making sure she wasn’t scared or nervous, talking her through as they went along, giving her breaks between steps.  She didn’t even need the laughing gas to relax her for the procedure. It all went so smoothly!

And after all that, my other 7-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy also saw Dr. Tsai for the first time.  We had one big day in Dr. Tsai’s office for sure!  We were there most of the day with all 3 of my kiddoes being seen by Dr. Tsai, which I actually thought would be too much for their office to handle!  Instead, the staff were all completely patient, friendly and helpful—with the treatment plans for each of my children; with the usual confusion and headache of insurance matters—deductibles, what is covered/not covered, what remains to be paid out of pocket, etc.  They were so patient and considerate explaining all to me as we went through each of my children’s new dental care plans.

Overall, I am so happy that I looked Dr. Tsai up for my 3 younger children after a whole decade moved to WA!  Thank you, Dr. Tsai and your wonderful office team for repairing Aubrey’s teeth just nearly “Good as new”!  It simply could not have gone any better!  My kids look forward to their next visit with Dr. Tsai.  Excuse the length here; you can edit this post as you like.  Well done, Dr. Tsai and your Carlsbad Pediatric Smiles Dentistry team!

With our genuine thank you!

Laurie, Aubrey, and my other two young children< /text>

I am a dental provider in North County SD as well and know of just about all specialty dental office in the area. I can say with confidence that Carlsbadds Pediatric Dentistry does it all right. Their patient care, their empathic approach, their skills are all top notch. The office is very kid friendly, providing fun activities to kids of varying ages. The offices is very visually interesting/stimulating as well. Almost a sense of a playground, but very clean and sterile at the same time. My kids have a great time in this office beyond the actual dentistry. It is far from your standard dental office and one that gives children excitement to visit. Even for adults, it is very pleasant to just hang out in.

The entire staff is really dialed in to the overall experience. From the moment of walking in the office to walking out, there is a sense that everyone is on the same page, no confusion, clear explanations, and most importantly, my child received excellent care. I believe my kids feel as secure as I do while in the office. And they look forward to returning.

I would confidently recommend this pediatric practice to anyone.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Best experience with Dentistry ever!! Not only is the facility super cute and fun for my kiddos, the staff is AMAZING! Everyone is so friendly and informative. You can tell the staff genuinely cares for you and your family. We get txt/ phone calls for follow-ups after dental work is done. My kids love it. I 100% recommend Carlsbad Pediatric Smiles!</Review>

My three children have been going to Dr. Tsai and her amazing staff  for many years and I truly can't say enough about them!  Each and every person we have encountered over the years from the office staff , to the hygienists, up to Dr. Tsai and Dr. Judy themselves have been AMAZING!  Two of my children are on the spectrum and the staff is patient and kind dealing with any sensory or anxiety issues they might have during a visit.  They LOVE going to the dentist and that is because the entire staff makes it such a positive experience for them. Dr. Tsai is also incredibly knowledgable and often catches issues even before our ortho does.  She truly takes the time with each and every patient and always put their needs first.  They office staff is also very honest and up front with billing and estimates.  You will always know what is covered by insurance and what isn't.  They never try to up-sell you on services that aren't needed and you won't get any surprise bills in the mail. Each and every thing they do is truly for the good of the patient.  I can't recommend them enough and our family is incredibly grateful for all that they do and have done for us over the years!<//Text>

Love this place as a parent and more importantly, my kids love this place! Everyone is so very kind, patient, and they're always attentive to kids. My kids have had dental work done, besides cleanings, and STILL look forward to coming here! They have TVs mounted for children to watch while getting work done, tokens for prizes, a play area with video games and one with toys. All around, highly recommend this place! Haven't tried any other dentists in the area, but haven't had a desire to switch to another!< /review>

We always have a great experience when coming; however, today was our first time coming during the COVID19 pandemic and I was thoroughly impressed with the safety measures they have in place. I felt safe and that was a huge relief for me as a mom of three little ones that I brought in. Thanks CarlsbaDDS Pediatric Smiles!< /review>

Child centric and healthy atmosphere, it has a warm welcome for kids coming to see the dentist. Instead of waiting in a room that is chalk white while smelling of antiseptic and latex, the warm colors and warmer staff help ease you away from the trauma of our own childhood.

Available in the lobby is Xbox games, leggos, TV, Wi-Fi, and a turn-style prize machine. In the back is a gigantic doll house and action figures just waiting to be played with.<//Text>

<name>Ali LeBlanc</name><Review>My daughter has been a patient of Dr. Tsai’s since she cut her first tooth! Dr. Tsai and the whole team are absolutely amazing and have always made us feel right at home. The office is super friendly for kiddos of all ages and is gorgeous, and the quality of care that is provided is outstanding! My little girl can be skeptical of people at times and the staff is always great at getting her to come out of her shell (I mean, she actually has fun at the dentist!) while also educating her about how to brush and floss and the importance of dental care. We will be patients for life :)</Review>< date>

<Text>I went with my cousin to take her daughter here for a cleaning before spending the rest of the day in SD. This place is SO adorable!! The office was sea-themed, super clean, and had a really friendly staff who seemed to genuinely care about their patients. I don’t have kids of my own but will definitely be bringing them here once I do! I can see now why my cousin makes the drive all the way from Tustin for her daughter to see Dr. Tsai! Extremely cute office :)<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>What a great experience. Amazing dentists, techs and hygienists. My son had some work to get done and he actually had fun getting his teeth worked on! He was laughing, the ladies were laughing, I was laughing... it was so comfortable, and such a relief that my son wasn’t scared. Hands down best dentist we’ve ever been too.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dc721879a81387:0xbd2c42f555705828</Gmap_id><Date>1566529159582<//Date>< rating>

<text>My third grandchild was just seen at this “Children’s Dentist Office”.  All my children were seen by a regular Family Dentist while they were growing up.  I really had no idea there were specialized dentistry for kids. Dr. Tsai and her crew have been truly awesome with all three of my grandkids. My 4 year old granddaughter had a filing put into a canine tooth today without even a whimper.  She watched Frozen 2 on a ceiling monitor while inhaling from a strawberry smelling nose breather with laughing gas. Dr. Tsai’s entire crew are geared around positive reinforcement and the idea that “a child should never be afraid of going to their dentist”.

As a father of three and grandfather of ten I have seen it all and after my visits here at “Carlsbad DDS Pediatric Smiles” I will never go to another dentist with my grand children. I highly recommend this establishment for your children. You will be nothing but happy and satisfied with their exceptional Pediatrics Dentistry.< /text>< Pics>

Both the hygienist and Dr. Kate took the time to calm her down and make her feel comfortable, let her see all the dental instruments before they went in her mouth, and even demonstrated the tools on her stuffed animal before using anything on her, which she really liked. It actually also helped lower my anxiety, as it stresses me to see my daughter freaking out! Truly a great experience.<//text><Date>1565386311585< /Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I’ve been going to Dr. Tsai for my 3 boys dental works since her office was opened. This place goes above and beyond with their service and hygiene. The staffs are amazing, and Dr. Tsai has great chair-side manner. My older sons are away for college now, and they always tell me how much they missed and loved having their teeth cleaned there. Good thing I have my little one that’s still going so I can continue to see Dr. Tsai and her wonderful team for a few more years. Thank you everyone for the wonderful service.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Not impressed with the assistant that my 2 yr old was stuck with
She was very rough and was trying to pry his mouth open with more force than should be used on a 2 yr old. She made him very uncomfortable about dentists and I asked her to stop because he was very uncomfortable with the force she was using on him
The dentist didn’t have an issue asking him to open his mouth. He is a pretty tolerant cooperative child and now has a bad feeling for the dentist after 1 trip here. Overall I didn’t care for the office<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Tsai and her staff truly cares.  I really appreciate Dr. Tsai's preventative, forward-thinking approach to my son's tight frenulum problem. She explained the pros and cons of different treatment options and the future implications of each. I'm someone who values seeing the big-picture of things so I love it! It shows that she really cares about my son's general well-being in years to come and not just selling us on procedures now. Of all my years coming here, I've never felt like I was just an income source to them.  This is the place for you too if you're looking for a dental home, and not just a dental visit.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>My son has traits of autism, so I was so nervous to take him to his first dentist appointment! I can’t express how wonderful and amazing the entire staff was from beginning to end and I absolutely loved Dr Tasi! Everyone made us feel so comfortable and they were all so nice. After going to their office, I will never take my son anywhere else. They really know how to work with small children and did I mention how amazing their office is?? I was very impressed.

My children's experience at Dr. Tsai's office is always great. The office is clean and ordered, and has a very fun, vibrant, and kid-friendly atmosphere. The staff are all very professional, thorough, and friendly. My kids have fun going to the dentist as they get to watch TV on the ceiling while getting their cleanings, and fun prizes before and after their appointments (something I don't remember for myself at their ages!). They even look forward to going to their appointments! I would highly recommend this dentist for your children.<//Review>

<text>AMAZING!! Dr. Tsai is very nice and is thorough with her explanations. Every decision that was made was done in a collaborative environment. We  made an error which delayed treatment for the day but they were EXTREMELY accommodating and moved around their schedules to allow for us to complete the procedure later in the day! They did not make us feel bad about our mistake! I highly recommend this office!!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Exceptional dentist and dental office!! I don’t usually write reviews but as someone in the medical profession, I feel an obligation to share with ppl when I find a gem like Dr. Tsai.  First of all, the office is a well-oiled machine; everyone is on the same page. The staff is warm, welcoming and attentive.  Most importantly, they all seem to love their job and committed to continually give my boys a positive dental experience.  Beyond the warm staff and fun office setup (ocean theme w/ a gigantic octopus!), what keeps me coming back is Dr. Tsai’s extensive, up-to-date knowledge about treatment (and her bedside manner, of course!) I’ve been coming here since her office opened and Dr. Tsai has earned my trust. I trust her bc she presents different treatment options, and explains to us the pros and cons, and what the latest research/literature says about the best practice. And here is how Dr. Tsai is exceptional, her recommendation is not generic, it is personalized to each kid’s needs and distinct personality.  (Yes, she is observant and takes time to know each kid.) I never feel pushed or pressured and she encourages us to get a second opinion if we ever had any hesitation. (In my experience, shady ppl don’t tell you to get a second opinion).  So proud to call Dr. Tsai our dentist!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dc721879a81387:0xbd2c42f555705828< /GmapID></record>

<text>Dr. Tsai and staff are AMAZING! I commute from Fallbrook just so I know my son will get the best care. They are all great with kids and my son genuinely thinks going to the dentist is fun! The best part is that Dr. Tsai always shows with x-rays and pictures anything that she finds that may be of concern so I can see it with my own eyes. I reccomend her to everyone I know!<//text>< pictures>

We have 3 children and initially this was a great dentist, lots to look at and play with. Great toys and rewards. Kind of like the McDonald's of dentists. But think for a moment how they pay for all this bling? Dr Tsai is great with the easy cleanings, but if you ever get one of her extended service bills you will be shocked as we were. My 2 daughters did fine with this system, but my son has cavity prone teeth. When he was 5 we got our first shock. He apparently had multiple cavities and there was extensive treatment to the tune of almost $2,000 out of pocket. Mainly due to her insistence on full sedation. We ended up doing most of the work outside her office at another dentist for half the cost. Then we came back and 6 months later and assessment #2 for another almost $2,000 out of pocket the same year. She was basically redoing much of the work that had just been done. It felt like she wanted to punish us for going outside her office. So we got another second opinion and guess what? The other assessment was 1/4 the cost of Dr Tsai, much cheaper again. Much of the treatment plan was redundant and unnecessary. So with this trend we decided to keep my son at the new dentist, but we wanted to maintain my 2 daughters at this office. We were notified today that Dr Tsai is refusing service to my 2 daughters since I decided to take my son to a new dentist. This is after 6 years of being a loyal customer, and it has been 6 months since the last visit. We just found out from the receptionist that all our appointments have been cancelled, and not one person from her office decided they should call and let us know. This is so unprofessional. I think we hurt her fragile ego, even though she encouraged us to get a second opinion. Oh well. I was tired of getting overcharged for her services anyways. I should also mention the service we did receive was sometimes below average. My son had many crowns put on by her staff, and there were issues with the crowns being placed poorly or the wrong size being used. There were at least 2 times he left in tears after treatment and they tried to gloss over it with a premium toy. I would rather have better treatment and no toy, than poor treatment with a premium toy. Don't be fooled by all the toys and bright colors, you will be paying for all of it eventually.< /Review>< Pictures>

We absolutely love Dr Tsai and her staff! We started seeing Dr Tsai after having a very traumatizing experience with another pediatric dentist. Our daughter was so traumatized that I couldn’t tell her before hand we were going to see the dentist. Dr Tsai helped our daughter overcome her fears of going to the dentist. It was because of Dr Tsai and her staff that our daughter was able to rebuild her trust with Dentists and Doctors in general. We love the fact that we see the same faces all the time when we go in for an appointment. We are especially grateful for Mayra who was pretty much the one assigned to us since day 1! She provides exceptional care to our kiddos and makes sure she explains everything to them as she is working on them-leaving them with no questions to ask :) We are forever grateful to have found Dr Tsai and her staff! Best Dentist ever!!!!</Text>

<Review>We've been going here for years and my children always leave there happy even when they've gotten work done. The staff is amazing and they are so well organized and take care of you the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the office. On top of that, Dr. Linh and her assistant are very very skilled at what they do and making sure my children are comfortable every step of the way. They try to get things done in a timely manner and I could not recommend this place enough.</Review>< Pics>

What a fun experience! My son is extremely apprehensive about the dentist. The staff explained things to him and got him through his first REAL cleaning. A lot of care has been put into the office visually, which puts kids at ease even more. So far, we are impressed.< /Review>

<Text>We love going to our appts at CarlsbadDDS! Routine check ups are a breeze, the staff and RDHs are friendly and helpful, and the doctors are top notch. I've been bringing my little one here since she was around 6 mo, and she has never had a bad visit. We had a little emergency the other day (torn top lip frenulum from a bad fall), and luckily got an appt right away after our ER visit; Dr. Tsai actually stepped in for the exam despite her busy day. She was very thorough in the examination, talked me through proper care for the wounded area, and signs that would warrant a follow-up. I definitely felt at ease after Dr. Tsai's evaluation and recommendations. Sure enough, the tear is healing very nicely as Dr. Tsai said. This is the place to go to make sure kids don't develop anxiety with dental visits, and continue building positive oral hygiene habits. I can't recommend this place enough! (And already have to at least a dozen friends!)</Text><date>1565236742464< /date>< Rate>

This place is Awesome!  They have excellent customer service for mom and are wonderful with the kiddos.  They have video games, train tables,  dollhouses, and play kitchen. They give the little ones lots of incentives to keep cavity free. Then they go home with a balloon, stickers, n a gum ball toy.  Love this place.<//text>

Every appointment my son has had were always greeted by friendly receptionists. Everyone is very helpful and wants to make sure that all your questions and concerns are answered. Dr. Tasi is absolutely amazing with my son. She makes sure that he is calm and tells him step by step what she is going to do. She makes it a point to show him how everything will feel and shows him all the tools she will use. I recommend Dr. Tsai's office to all the mothers i know.< /Review>

Dr. Tsai and her team are outstanding professionals! I called on a Tuesday and my son was seen the next day! As a new patient, my pre-schooler was a little scared to see the dentist. However, his nerves fizzled away once when we walked into the kid-friendly ocean-themed office. It felt more like a trip to the beach than like a trip to the dentist. The staff were friendly and informative, especially technician Brianna! She gave the dental instruments fun names like "tooth tickler" and explained that x-rays were "pretty pictures of your teeth". My son loved that! When we met Dr. Tsai, her warm and authentic demeanor was the cherry on top of our experience. Now my son WANTS to go to the dentist again!<//Text>

Terrible! They put  a crown in my 12 year old mouth that was to big. Then sent her home with a  throbbing mouth. My daughters original dentist said her tooth just needed a quick filling. They just care about money not the health.

DO NOT GO TO THIS DENTIST!</Review>

This entire office works as a team to make each child feel safe and unafraid, my daughter was nervous and they thoroughly explained how each step would feel and made her at ease.  I cannot say enough nice things about everyone there.<//Text>

<Review>It was amazing. My two year old son was intolerable at times but the staff and doctor were patient. Dr.Tsai even called the next day to follow up on how Noah was doing. The office is kid friendly and my son loved playing there, they even gave him a balloon!< /Review>< user_name>

<rating>4<//rating><review>This was the nicest dental office I have ever been in, they have video games for the children to play, a big flat screen TV in the waiting room, and a play area for them also. The staff was very nice, caring, and professional. Dr. Tsai was also very nice and gentle with my son, he's 2 years old. We found out he needed 2 teeth extracted because they had been chipped when he was younger and had continued chipping overtime and could lead to an abscess and the teeth rotting. I was very nervous about my son having that done. They said they would give him an oral sedative that would help keep him calm. He took the sedative and was falling asleep after about 10 minutes and then they called us back, he got the numbing shots without much complaint, but as soon as she pulled the first tooth, he started screaming and wiggling, it was over really fast, maybe one minute, but he kept screaming and was inconsolable for about an hour until he fell asleep in the car. He slept for 2 hours and when he woke up he was crying and once again inconsolable for about 45 minutes. He finally calmed down and ate some food and watched some cartoons and he's been fine every since. So although the dentist was great, the experience was pretty traumatizing for my son and me and the only thing I wish would have gone differently is that he could have been asleep during the procedure, if the Dr. would have offered the option of General Anesthesia at the time things would have gone more smoothly. But every child reacts differently to the oral anesthetic and since he is so young she felt that was the best option. Next time I will request General Anesthetic to prevent another traumatizing experience.<//review>< pictures>

5+ Stars. My family and I couldn't be happier with Pediatric Smiles. EVERYONE there is great with kids, but are also very good communicators with the adults. They are sympathetic and understanding of the challenges that come with working with small children. But, not only are the people there wonderful, the whole environment is warm and inviting. One of the issues with Dentists, is sometimes people get the feeling that they are being up-sold constantly...but we've never experienced that here, we trust Dr. Tsai and her staff completely. Can't recommend this place enough.< /text>

< Review>
I have been taking my grandchildren here for the last 6 years.  Dr. Tsai have been very caring and attentive to our family.  She knows that i probably don't rely her report to the parents as well, so she take the time to call and update their mom on the findings.  She really makes everything really easy for the children and my family.  Thanks Dr. Tsai!< /Review>

Brought my one and a half year old in for his first visit and I was terrified it was going to be TERRIBLE. Not only was the staff amazing. But everyone was so patient. My son did better then I have seen him do at any doctors office, and I truly believe it's because of how caring they were. They make checking in quick and pain-less. Truly a kid atmosphere . And I'm so unbelievably thankful my son won't have a fear of the dentist! (:</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) First impression was bad, a not very pleasant place, after ordering a coffee my impression changed to good, the coffee had a rich and fresh smell, it tasted very good, everything was better, the bad thing was in the food, the menudo we ordered had a Unpleasant taste to be exact the menudo was already rotting it tasted bad. The birria was not the best and I tried other very tasty ones. The bill was more than it should have been. They charged 115 for trash they gave us. He did not recommend it.

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>I scheduled a hitch installation for my vehicle. U-haul online claimed I can go there at 4 pm, but there was no tech available on site. We rescheduled for another day, and it went very smooth. Please call ahead to confirm, don't trust u-haul's website.  The installation was done in an hour. While they were working on it, I was able to continue to do my work thanks to their free wifi. Staff were polite and courteous. I have no experience with the other services they provide, but hitch installation was fine for my Subaru Crosstrek.<//Text>< userid>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I got a storage unit here today and would like to recognize Toby Anders for his diligence and customer service.
He is the sole reason i went from being a dissatisfied customer based on the poor execution of the 1800-gouhaul rep, to being a happy customer who came here to leave a 5* review instead.

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Worst experience ever! Do not use Ubox for anything! I would rate less than one star if it were possible. Had a hard time getting Uhaul to pick up Ubox from my home once I had it loaded. Buyers wouldn't close until it was gone. Arrived at destination more than 10 days later than guaranteed date, actually more than two weeks but the guarantee date was moved forward online, causing me to have to sleep on floor in my new place waiting for my items to arrive. At one point I received an email from U-haul saying I will be notified once the U-box has been found on the boat. I only moved from California to Oregon. Antique sideboard marble top was cracked in half, see pictures. Filed claim and was denied any compensation. Told there was no sign of damage to U-box so not their fault. Definitely going to get the word out that Uhaul's Ubox is not the way to go!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I would not trust this place, The area does false advertisement.  They have storage rooms outside that look nice, but when you go in the storage looks like a dump, looking old, and in a falling apart building.  The storage also has plenty of dust for the virus to hide in.  The roofs of the storage are fence material so all your things will get that virus dust.  The rooms are weird sizes so you might get one with a big bar in the middle, and they will not discount that for you.  They have military options but will not tell you about it.  This is to make more money off of you.  They are penny pinchers so any type of mark that is on the rental and they will bust you for.  Make sure you take a picture of "everything".  The trucks are always dirty, and present a real nice environment for the virus.  The manager Jose Agular is not so kind to the customers, and be careful making a reservation because if you change plans he will charge you 50 plus, and make your first step in the moving experience the worst.  Make sure you ask for a rental that has a charged battery because they do not charge the rental on a daily basis.  The only good part are the hitch installations by Steven McDonald.  He has that touch making that hitch look nice.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Hitch pro Steven McDonald was wonderful. Knowledgeable, honest, friendly, and efficient.  Will absolutely be coming to him for any and all hitch needs and telling my friends.</review>

I ordered a trailer hitch/install on the Uhaul website over a week ago. I was scheduled to have it installed today. When I arrived, they told me the hitch had not arrived. I never received a call telling me that I would not be able to get the hitch installed today.

I understand that parts can run late, but there is no excuse not to notify a customer. They waisted my time, I drove from Lakeside to Poway for no reason.< /Text>

<Text>This place is the worst.  The manager Jose which is not worthy of the name is the worst.  Not kind, and does not clean the terminals that we have to use in that place.  SO dirty inside, even with a mask you are not taking care of your health.  No one in there does there job correctly. The storage sucks, what a waste of time. The trucks smell like nasty, and everything is super sticky. Never going here again, I recommend another place people.</Text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I made a reservation for a specific location and my reservation was changed to a new location but UHaul didn't bother to email or call me.  So I had to go much farther and pickup a very old, beat-up and unsafe (as the back doors opened multiple times while driving on the freeway) to pickup and than again to return the trailer.  After almost 20 years of our company renting from UHaul, I'm VERY disappointed and we will be taking our business elsewhere.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Has always been a good place to rent a truck. I've done so several times and have had good trucks and some old ones, but they have always been fair and have done everything that was expected of them. Good store of supplies in their lobby. Be sure to make a reservation during peak moving times (summer).< /text>

Horable check in experience! No room for parking outside. For no reason other than trying to send him a link the guy that was behind me is now at the desk getting his truck. No such thing as Express checkin. I got here at 11 and its now 1149 and only 2 people have been helped. 4 people left to do business elsewhere.<//text>

<Text>I needed a van to go pickup some furniture at IKEA that wouldn't fit in my car. These guys were right there for me when I needed them. I rented a van for $20 a day plus $.69 a mile as I recall. The whole bill was less than $70. I've heard the IKEA delivery guys suck and overcharge. Also if you want something done right do it yourself. I got all of the stuff I needed for my project with room to spare and the van was so easy to use. Way better than your personal vehicle for this sort of thing. The staff was laid back and easy to deal with. It's much better to go see these guys than it is poking a hole in your headliner trying to use your car as a moving van. They've got several sizes of van or truck all ready to drive off.</Text>< userid>

<Review>Unaware of my rental, slow to get the truck ready, and they seemed completely clueless about any online rental processes. (This was the first time). The second time was even worse, with employees who had a rude and harsh tone, and what I feel was false advertising and outright dishonesty about a very minor refund. I would not recommend this uhaul location to anyone...ever.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Used their online check in which gave me a recommend arrival time at 1:02pm to avoid the 45minute wait. Arrived at 12:55 to find that I still had a 25 minute wait then one stylist skipped over our name when my son was "On Deck". Total wait time in the store over an hour after checking in online . Then they wanted to charge me full price. Will not return.</Review><rate>1</rate>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I stopped by for a trim to my bangs this morning while visiting from Indiana. The salon was extremely clean and immaculate! The stylist did my cut just as I wanted and was an excellent listener to what I was wanting as the outcome of my cut.   She was friendly, courteous and very kind. I appreciated the outstanding service! And the price was great! God bless you all!</Review>

Get a nice new cut and enjoyed some college hockey while I got my cut.  I am the absolute worst with names, but my hair (stylist? barber? Not sure what the correct title is) did an epic job.  Her name started with a D (I think) Not having had a normal haircut in over a year was brutal, can’t wait to go back for the MVP!  Highly recommended!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Clean establishment, friendly staff and simple layout of services. In a non-covid era this place would be great with it's steaming hot face towels, but having to wear a mask while your face is wrapped in a hot towel is less than ideal. The manager was fantastic and great at providing ideas for a post-covid caveman hairdo like mine. She was quick, efficient, and conscientious. While the back massage and the massage chair were seriously lacking, her head massage shampoo was above the mark. I would recommend Lexi to all. The wait times are a little cray, but expected. 4 stars only because of the great service. In the end, my haircut was great.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dbf5534f0decf7:0x84444993ec8a7d0d</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My son really liked the hairstylist. She cut his hair exactly how he wanted and offered great advice to him about how to get the look he wanted. My son very rarely likes haircuts, so we are definitely going back. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the wait time was almost 40 minutes, they need more stylists. Definitely use the app to check in before you go!</review>

<text>Although I think the prices are a bit on the higher side, they were awesome. Especially in this time of having to adapt to the circumstances. Sure it’s a haste to get a haircut with a mask on, but they definitely took all the precautions available to get haircuts done. They all did a great job!</text>< resp>

<text>Delma was one of the barbers, and she had great service, and was pretty kind. The place itself also takes COVID-19 precautions pretty seriously, so it was definitely some relief and gave me a sense of security knowing that health safety came first with these guys. Given the profession. Anyways, great place, recommend this location to anyone.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf5534f0decf7:0x84444993ec8a7d0d< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Online check in wait times are wildly inaccurate. If someone invented a proper way to schedule reasonable haircuts for men, they'd put everyone else out of business. Unfortunately this company is yet another fail in that regard.<//Review>

Essie was amazing, friendly, kind, and easy to chat with. That’s on top of the PERFECT haircut! I don’t usually go to barbers I don’t know, but she got me haircut EXACTLY how I wanted it! She needs a raise!<//Text>

<Review>Always get a great haircut from Kara.  They take great precautions relative to Covid19, and make you feel safe and comfortable.  I would recommend for the protection of the stylists and customers, that a face shield be installed behind the check in kiosks.  Would go along way towards making both customer and stylist comfortable.< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

Happy that a place is open. A little hot with cutting hair under canopies but they do everything they can to make your hair as enjoyable as possible.</Text>

Had a great experience with Kayla (I believe that was her name). I left feeling much better after not having had a haircut in a few months. Thanks Kayla (again I hope that is her name, sorry if it is not)</text>

I had my haircut done on a very hot Saturday. The man who did my hair was very professional, quick, thorough, and got it right. I have alaways had a good experience with sport clips. Can't wait for covid to be over so I can get the rinse, massage, and hot towl. I will definitely be going back.<//Review>

Use of the mobile app simplified the appointment. I showed up as directed by the app and “bam” my seat was ready and available.  Got rid of the pandemic overgrown hair and walked out with a clean shaped style. A hair stylist’s tools work the same under a canopy or in the salon. Either way the he result was excellent.<//Review>

This was my first experience here. The location was easy to find and parking was simple. The staff was very friendly, personable, and efficient. The facility was clean and organized. I've been getting my hair cut by the same person for the last 15 years. I just moved here, though, and needed to find some place new. My hair looks nearly identical to how it always has. I'm very satisfied with how they did.</review>

We checked in on line to try and save time and waited an hour... No big deal yet. When we showed up the screen said we had 5 minutes left to wait. I went to Ralphs since I didn't think it would be too long and when I got back my son pointed at the screen and they added an hour on to our wait. They said the girl that we made an appointment with went on her lunch knowing she had an appointment... Really!?  Instead of offering us another stylist they made us wait another hour and 45 minutes for the next stylist. Again... Do not bother coming here or even trying to check in online they don't stick to anything booked on either list.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Very expensive for a generic haircut. Great clips is on the other side of the parking lot for 15% cheaper. Staff is friendly, Place appears clean. Recommend coming down on price or offering more the just a basic cut for $23 without tip.

I am losing my crown hair so I just get a touch up every 2 weeks so $55 a month is pretty rough. There should be a buzz cut package.</Text>< Pics>

I had a longtime barber whom I trusted to keep me lined up. I have a difficult haircut. Double zero with a fade. He closed up and moved. I’ve been a few places trying to replace him. No one came close. When I came in I told the stylist, she wasn’t fazed at all. Not only did she do a wonderful job she also washed my hair and a nice shoulder massage, all while watching Monday Night Football. If you have a good look you want to keep up or you’re looking for something new check it out. I was impressed. Lexi took care of me but I was watching other stylists and they turned out a couple others who looked sharp also. I found my new regular. Hopefully you will too. Get cleaned up. Don’t walk around with an average look. First impressions are everything.</Review>

I noticed she was very chatty with the gentleman who got a haircut prior but wasn’t very engaging with me. I believe part of the barber/stylist- client experience is the small chit-chat over whatever. I probably will return but I will go to a different stylist.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

First of all I passed on the hair washing. So all the time was just to cut my hair. The lady acted like she was in  some kind of race. And their were no customers waiting. The hair cut was average at best. And at $28.00 plus $5.00 tip the most  I have ever paid for a hair cut. I don't really feel the lady earned the tip. But anyway.  There are better cheaper places to get a hair cut.< /text>

Very Professional staff and Lexi gave me a really great quality Haircut. I will continue to come to this Sports Clips vs the one i use to go to in Escondido. I will recommend this Sports Clips to anyone who asks about where the best place to get a haircut</Review>

The waiting time is not bad, the scheduling system is really good, but don’t risk it and use any of the hairstylist because mine was not really good. She tried asking me how to fix my hair after she ruined it but come on, too late you shaved that spot!! Good thing it grows out fast</Text>

<Review>I tried Sport Clips for the first time, after finding out that my regular salon had gone out of business. I could not have asked for a better haircut! The service was friendly, efficient, and thorough. It was mid afternoon, with no wait time, and I was in and out in little time. Definitely going back for my next cut!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I feel terrible for not remembering the dresser's name, but she was Thai. She could not have been nicer. Great conversation, attention to detail, and went out of her way to give me the best sports clips experience. My hair is exactly the way I wanted it. Will definitely go back for my next haircut.< /review>

Essie did a great job cutting my hair. I have very wavy hair and a lumpy skull, so her efforts were very much appreciated. She was super friendly and made me feel like a long time client as opposed to a first timer who just walked in. I’d recommend her to anyone needing a haircut.<//review>

Best haircut ever!

This place is really designed for a guy to get a great haircut in a great atmosphere. I get my haircut there all the time now. All stylists are well trained in men's cuts and each time I get the haircut I want, regardless who cuts my hair. They enter in the system the style you got last time, so next time they know what you want.

The place is designed for guys so even if you have to wait, you can watch sports on TV or read. The staff is very friendly and after a few times they remember you by name.

This is a real breath of fresh air and a great change for better from Supercuts or Great Clips or women's salons. No gossip, no smell of perms. Oh, be careful that you do not end up at Great Clips in the same shopping center, or you will have to go to Sport Clips to get your hair fixed.

They also give you a free neck trim between cuts for free for a quick clean up - great benefit and saves you money.

Highly recommended.</Review>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>I am disappointed yet compelled to write this review.  This used to be an enjoyable experience for my husband.  He could run over, get a decent cut, and be done.  Over the last few months the service has declined and he will no longer be getting his hair cut here.  The ladies that he used to trust to cut his hair are no longer there.  The employees that are working there now underestimate the wait time, do not communicate with the waiting room full of people so that you never know if you're next in line or fifth in line, and they take well over 30 minutes per cut.  That would be fine for a salon, but this is a shop that caters to guys.  Guys want to be in and out, not spend 2 hours waiting on a Sunday morning. They are understaffed for a weekend.  It's too bad but if you are looking for a decent cut in a reasonable time, don't go here.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><user>113355244473102682610<//user>< Time>

Been going to all different Sportsclips for years & yesterday was the best experience I ever had. Didn’t know until yesterday you could do a double MVP & get a 2nd wash & towel. Was never offered @ any other Sportsclips EVER!!! Thank you for a great experience!!!

<text>Don't believe time estimates. Checked in online on a Tuesday afternoon, system told me there was a 20 minute wait. Showed up at the time recommended and I was at the top of the list when I arrived with no one else waiting. 1 employee cutting hair, 2 other employees chatting at the register. They could barely be bothered to tell me that it would be just a minute. Waited in the lobby for 20 minutes (its now been 40) with no further interactions with anyone. I left.
Walked over to Great Clips in the same parking lot and was serviced professionally and in a timely manner.<//text>< Pictures>

This was my first time experience at SportClips. I was immediately greeted as I entered. I entered my info and waited for the first available barber. Passar was my barber and she was very nice. Great cut... my only negative would be the price was a little high.<//text>

I called ahead at 4:30 PM on Sunday for my haircut.  The person who answered the phone took my name and told me that the wait would be 45 minutes.  I arrived at the San Marcos location at 5:05 PM and was told by the receptionist that the store was closed.  I explained that I had called ahead and that I was told the wait was 45 minutes.  I was refused service because it was after 5:00 PM.

On my way out, I told the receptionist that it would have been considerate for her to remind me that although the wait is 45 minutes, the store closes at 5:00.  She replied, "Have you not been here before?"

I felt that this was rude and no way to treat me as a loyal customer.  I have been getting haircuts exclusively at the San Marcos establishment for over 2 years.  Frankly, the haircuts are mediocre and definitely overpriced.  However, I have chosen Sport Clips as "my" barber because the customer service has always been exceptional.  And now with my new opinion and disappointment, I'm re-evaluating why I go there.< /review>

<Date>1537542707443<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Text>My initial rating would have been 2 stars. Kiki was my stylist, could tell she was new. She was kind and had great customer service (2 stars for that) but cannot cut hair at all! (0 stars for that). She was a bit slow and I was in a rush, so I left in a hurry without actually realizing how bad my hair looked. Went on with my day and when I got home around 4:30pm I finally looked in the mirror and noticed the hack job. I called the store and spoke to Lexi (Manager). She was very nice and asks me to come right in so she could fix it. Lexi was awesome! I had her cut my son’s hair first and then when it was my turn she noticed right away what was wrong. It was almost like she forgot to cut the left side! Haha and uneven throughout. Lexi did and excellent job fixing my hair and was super nice to my son and I. Lexi gets 5 stars for being so awesome! In the end my hair turned out to be a little shorter than I wanted it to be but 10 times better than my initial cut.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The service part of my son's haircut was wonderful. He's only 5, but the stylist was great with him. The haircut is exactly what he wanted! The reason I'm giving 4/5 stars is the online checkin.  I checked in and it said it would be a 28 minute wait and to arrive at a certain time. Ok. No problem. We arrived right around that time, and it said he had a 28 minute wait. I know that things happen and it can get busy and backed up, but I was annoyed that we had to wait again. Too bad their system doesn't text you with updates about the wait.</text>

Overall awesome hair cut just didnt notice afterwards my whole entire back was covered in hair. As if the rob wasnt placed well over me when I got the hair cut and just chunks of hair all over me. Very messy but good hair cut.<//Review>

She went as fast as she could with an empty waiting room and did the bare minimum. Haircut looks horrible- uneven and missed hairs everywhere. I got the MVP and I could tell she was completely over her job and wanted me out. Never going back to that location again.</Text>< pictures>

<name>Tristen Callen<//name><review>Dude. They blew my mind. For years i went to the same people at supercuts in oceanside. And this place in san marcos just.....wow. I never thought a haircut place would treat their customers so well. Massage chair. Tea tree face towel why getting your haor,lathered and head massaged? And then on top of that you get that massage thing after your done....MVP treatment y'all. For 5 extra bucks.....wayyyyy worth it.

And they do free neck line trim and get up around the ears to make a haircut last way longer.

Deffinitly coming back.<//review><gmapID>0x80dbf5534f0decf7:0x84444993ec8a7d0d<//gmapID>< userid>

Horrible service very unprofessional did not show any respect towards the customer.
as I walked in with my children earlier I immediately felt an unwanted vibe
As i respectfully ask my questions I was spoke to as if i were below the employee as an individual.I felt very disrepected.
will not recommend this shop.<//text>

I was able to set up a walk-in appointment with Delma who gave me an amazing haircut!! Not only did I get an awesome haircut but the stylist took extra time to show me how I could style my hair with my new hairstyle!

<Review>Just returned from getting my hair cut here. Asked for 1/2" off and got scalped on the sides and the top is too long. There are stray missed hairs all over the side of my head and my side burns are uneven. I guess what can you expect for $22? Well, I expect a hair cutter to spend more than 5 minutes on my hair and to at least halfway care about what she does for a living. Basically, it seems like they act like they listen but then give you the same haircut they just gave the last poor guy. What separates this place is, you get to watch sports (to distract you from what's happening to your poor head?) but it seems like they penalize you if you don't order the MVP.

I don't know what comes over me when I get a haircut. When I'm done, I never see how bad it is until I get home and look in the mirror - and it's a disaster. These churn and burn hair places are all the same (Supercuts, Fantastic Sam's and now Sport Clips). This San Marcos location used to be good but as a reviewer pointed out previously, the turnover changes all the time so you are rolling the dice as to who will cut/butcher your hair.

By the way, I have a job interview tomorrow so this doubly sucks. I will not go back to any of these craptastic places again. You get what you pay for. NO ONE CAN GIVE A DECENT HAIR CUT IN 5 MINUTES!! Even with my hair that is so simple to cut.

Do not go here.</Review>< Pictures>

5 dollar haircut that cost me 30 dollars. I have strangler hairs on the ends of my hair that I had to personally deal with using a nail cutter. Also I guess they are known for their stylists for talking to their customers but that is unnecessary.< /review>

Decent haircut but you can get a much better fade at a barber shop...if it's just for your kid - great place but if you're a guy and you want a tight or close fade you don't really want to go here. $20 and up before tip.< /review>

Called ahead, they never wrote it in. Waited an extra half hour.  When they did call me it was the wrong person and had me go wait behind people that never showed up. 5 girls working only two actually cutting hair, if that's what you want to call it. The "haircut" is horrible. Never going back.</text>

Very unprofessional.  I was asked to wait for 35 minutes, so I left and came back 25 minutes later.  Someone had taken my spot so they asked me to wait another 15 minutes.  Again, I left for 5 minutes to run to the store next door.  When I returned they asked me to return 20 minutes later.  My time is important to me...obviously it is not to them.<//text>

There's no sugar coating this experience. First, I called ahead to ask if they do military haircuts, they said yes. I get there, wait 12 minutes, at least, for this older woman to clean the place and walks around before saying she can help me, as if I came to sit there forever before getting my haircut,  while there was only one other person getting a haircut. She sits me down and asks how I want my cut, I say I want a high and tight. She looks at me and says, what's that? I said, I thought you do military cuts, she said yes but she's not that good at it and would take a long time, I'm not stupid so I know this is code for, I really don't know what I'm doing and offers me another girl who she says knows how to do them since she works at a barber shop also. I get this girl and she gives my back of my head a hill shape cut, literally cuts the back of my head so the middle of the back of my hair was shorter on top and the sides were lower and looked like a hill cut out on the back of my head. I had to teach her and explain how to cut a high and tight. She had my sides looking like a medium reg. haircut while the center of the back of my head had a hill cut out. I kept my calm and had to keep telling her what to cut and where to cut to fix this disaster. Outcome, no high and tight, just a.... Um how should I put this..... *$#@%* up haircut that even a low budget comedy film wouldn't want to pass as a Marine Corps high and tight. My head looks like a messed up looking cross between a mohawk and ..... Oh heck, its just straight jacked up. I will have to shave my head bald now to fix it. They are not friendly, they don't smile, they act like they are haircut slaves trapped against their will. Please put an end to these type of places and don't go here, EVER! She tried to cover up the fact that they don't know how to actually cut hair and I do a better job on my own head as I usually do but I just figured its free for the first time so what do I have to lose. So if your not ready or never shaved your head bald, don't ever try the free haircut. I gave her a $4 tip. You ask why? So do I. But bottom line, I gave it to her for not showing any attitude when I was teaching her how to do a high and tight on people and what points on each persons head she needs to look for to give anyone a high and tight. She tried covering up by saying, well there's different military cuts and I broke it down as to what they were and wasn't about to teach her how to cut all of them but I told her yes, low reg., medium reg., high and tight, and a horseshoe, for the truely dedicated, devil dogs like myself would do sometimes. Stick with the barbers in oceanside and preferably the old guys who know what they are doing. For everyone else, get a cheap cut somewhere else then use the extra cash you saved for some chow or to take a nice girl out on the town. I did not want to be bald since the weather is going to start getting colder and I have bad allergies that act up also by my head being too cold.

I bet the owners would read this review and not think twice about trying to do something for myself as an apology to try and at least make this horrible experience somewhat better. I bet they would just think, well it was free and he didn't mind going bald. Well I did not want to go bald, but had to. It took so long to grow my hair out for the top to have some nice growth. I am not serving in the military anymore but, Once a Marine, Always a Marine! I earned that title while obtaining platoon highshooter straight out of bootcamp. First person in my platoon to be Guide in bootcamp also back in 1995. God bless all my brothers and sisters out their protecting us all and to all our other branches of military as well.

In case some of you are wondering, I was a grunt.<//Text>

< Review>
They messed up my boyfriend's haircut.  They left a lot of long hairs on and a patch of hairs in one area, they also rounded one side of the back and squared the other one. They charged him 30$ for the haircut. He's never coming here again.<//Review>

A couple of our employees stopped in for lunch and the great plates of burgers and fries.  The food was so good we decided to put a food review on our blog.  If your close stop by and grab a burger you won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Highly recommended.</review>

Horrible experience ever.. the first thing that caught my eye was that it was completely empty.  The tables were dirty there was no napkin dispenser on tables or salt shakers the lady that was working had a bad attitude i asking for some napkins and she ignored me the burger that i ordered was ok not to die for. There are many burger places in carson and definitely wouldn't recommend this place. Bad service😡 omega Burgers was the best..< /Text>

I live near a ton of fast food restaurants and this place is small relaxing and has quality food. It’s somewhere I feel like I can relax while I eat a good. It’s been around forever and it never gets old.</Text>

A clean target, as expected from them. Everything is in place and easy to find. The workers are helpful, asked 3 different employees for help and they didn't hesitate to help me find what I was looking for. There's a Café and a Starbucks here just in case you get a craving for a quick snack or coffee.<//review>

<text>I always find what I need at the Candlewood location in Lakewood Ca.  I don't get alot of help from the the employees on the floor BUT I don't really seek help for anyone… I tried to go in and navigate by myself but if I really need help there's always somebody that will give me point me in the right direction if needed. I've been shopping at this Target location for many years so I pretty much know where everything is at.  Lol<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

i would give no stars! I was kicked out for having my service dog with me, that is against the law. When i explained he was my service dog, the lady in the front cut me off and told me to leave! Never coming back!</Text>

The environment is always safe, welcoming and friendly. It must be due to happy employees. I rarely hear employees having inappropriate conversations on the floor so common in many other places.</Text>

Love the drive up option. I had a good experience. Imagine staff members hand carrying your items to your car for you. No line to wait in. Just already bagged up and ready to go. I just wish they had more spots for the drive-up parking area.< /text>

I enjoy coming to this target. Employees are supper friendly and helpful. They treat all customers with respect. Spend your money here rather than the Walmart down the street that’s has a rude disrespectful disgusting staff that hunt you down.< /Text>

<text>This location is perfect for stopping by after work. It is preferably clean and easy to find what you need. I always use the app to help get savings!</text></record>

<text>This location is the best. The inside of the store has done a 360 change with its store layout, it’s very beautiful. I always find great deals here. The customer service is wonderful as well, when asking for help with something they are very attentive. They have some convent perks inside which are Starbucks and they snack bar. I recommend if in the area check them out.<//text>< Name>

Bryana or Briana from Gust Services helped me out, held the item that I called for and also wrapped the gift for me so I can take it to the wedding that day. She had great quality service and is an asset to the Target team. Would come back and deal with her for sure.</review>

They have really good items that are really great quality and the products last a long time. Ive had a coffee maker there for about 2 years now and it still works as if i bought it yesterday. They also have a great return policy so even if it does break after a while you can still return or exchange. Overall i love target they have everything i need. They just need to add more employees.<//Review>

Went there but got an item that wasn't the price I thought it would be, the cashier sent me back to get it instead of sending someone else. I felt like an employee. Plus she was taking her sweet time just to scan something.< /text>

My second item was not available for pick up only one item was ready. Email said my order was ready for pick up. Store rep could not explain why it was not ready other than they could not find second item and was not given ETA when it would be ready. I expected better service from Target, instead I felt like I was at Walmart.<//text>

I mean really? What a joke. If I’m buying a pizza combo shouldn’t you guys have a way to compensate the customer for the fact that your soda machine is NOT in a working order? Why do I have to pay regular price for a combo that’s an incomplete combo?? That’s ridiculous. That means I’m paying $7+ and on top of that I have to buy a soda bottle at $2+. That’s ridiculous. You guys remodeling is not our problem. If you can’t honor the combo then don’t sell it. Also, the stank attitude has to chill when I didn’t even come in with an attitude. But you’ll get an attitude if you wanna be snappy with me.<//text>

<Review>Great Target, mostly every section is clean and the workers are friendly and great, the only problem I have is every time I come, the same section is always just a heap of garbage on garbage. They never clean the section that has all the little figures and it bugs me. But besides, that it is a great place</Review>< Pictures>

Good location and friendly customer service. Compared to other stores, they usually have a good selection of items in stock.

I love Target in general and this location is no exception.< /review>

A very good Target, mostly clean and well kept. SouthBay Pavilion has just about everything you need and this Target is certainly key. I didn't find customer service to be up to par with the better Targets that are around.</text>

<Review>They're my local Target. The people are friendly, there's a good selection of products, though if I have time, I do go across the street to Walmart for produce, because the prices are better for that, and that selection is larger. That said, there is a Starbucks inside, and my young kids love coming here because (often) if they have good behavior the whole shopping experience, I let them each pick something from the dollar section. Yeah, I bribe them - it works for me.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I had a very bad experience at this Target. Will not come here again. I had an issue with my Cartwheel and went to the customer service desk, immediately Cory blamed me and said "Yall must of not done it right". While explaining the issue he continued blaming me. After my husband heard him the 3rd time he told him what was his problem... he then started aaying "I wont put up with that"... really? His manager asked him to step away 3 times and he refused.... I have never had that much of a horrible service in Target. So I am just thinking its this one, I am hoping.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>The Server was pretty rude with an attitude. "Anything Else" over and over, like she didn't want to be there. She was very inpatient with the girl, working with her. They charged me for the Salsa, that I thought was free with food... Good Customer Service, is important, even if you don't want to be at work!< /Text>< user_id>

The chicken is terrible as well as the customer service. They’ve hired literal 12 year olds who have no idea what they’re doing. I’d give it a zero if I could. Way expensive for terrible food save your money and go somewhere else< /Text>

Used to love this place. Our last 3 visits have been very disappointing. We loved it so much we kept going back hoping it would be back to normal. Food was very bland, (used to be awesome) restaurant seemed to be understaffed and service was really awful with this past weekend's being the worst- restaurant was not busy and we had to flag down the one waiter for a refill- 3x- waiter walked by numerous times looked at our table & group and kept on walking - we seemed to be inconveniencing him just by visiting, food was tasteless- something has happened in the last year. I would not recommend.<//Review>

The environment and staff were good, but the food was kind of bland ☹ not what Bobby's usually tastes like. We had the asada tacos and the grilled chicken tacos with rice and beans.
My 2 yr old son on the other hand loved his shredded chicken burrito and ate almost everything inside of it (he's picky with tortillas)
AND as always their chips and salsa were amazing 😄</text>

It's just not as good as his dad's place, Sal's, in Selma. Service is very nice, prices are a bit high, but I have to say that this place is just a notch above Taco Bell. Good for a FAST Mexican food fix but if I have the time there are other places that I would consider.</text>

Very good for fast food, friendly service. It was very clean with traditional music. Plenty of salsa to go. Have eaten here many times and the quality is consistent.<//Text>

The meat didn't have any flavor to it and looked like there was more beans and rice than meat.   I'll give it another try. Normally I'm very happy with going to Sals.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

My Mr ordered the monster burrito and it had to much beans. He didn't like his either. This was the 3rd time we did4loke or food.
So back to Sal's on Fresno & Nee's.  Their food is always good and fast with super nice. Cashiers, when its to go i still tip, you should to.< /Review>< Pics>

Bobby Salazar's is a great place satisfy your Mexican food craving. There's lots of room to sit down and eat and if the day is nice there's a nice patio for outdoor seating. This location in particular doesn't get much traffic< /review>

<Review>When I first walked in I notice women cutting a big blog I didn’t know what it was then I noticed she was cutting rice out of big bag like it was boiled I was immediately grossed out I would like to think they can at least cook the rice .Then I notice employe seasoning chips on the ground I mean there no other place in the whole kitchen but to have a bucket of chips on the ground where people walk to season chips . Need to say the less I still got some food there and my burrito had big pieces of fat in it horrible experience. Gross waste of lunch money all the above thumbs down and I actually like there food but not this location</Review><response>None< /response><pics>None<//pics><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80945b6f14e85e83:0xcb10d20b04b6201b< /gmap_id><name>Shaneice P</name><Date>1516999661244</Date>< UserId.>

Check out the GREAT value for a take out family pack.  Our favorite is a dozen enchiladas for $25, that comes with chips, a pint of their commercial salsa, pint of refrained beans and a pint of rice. Comparing  that to a $13+combination plate with three enchilada, a spoonful of beans and rice, and a few chips in a little bag,  can’t be beat ! I that to a $13+</review>

I always go by this place for a to go order.  I always ask for a burrito with 1/2 beans.  The worker asked me again about my order and then when I told her again, she gave me a dirty look.  She clearly gave he full beans because it exploded when I took a bite in my car.</review>

I work in the same center they advertise all over their windows and inside to try their albondigos soup for a year almost solid I've gone in or called and they've never had it not to mention the 15 min wait for a burrito when no ones there because they only care about the catering orders.!.< /Text>

This ride is definitely old. It's very fast and features loops and corkscrews. Make sure to keep your neck straight, or it'll smash against the hard rests on the tight turns.

Very recommended< /Review>

<review>I know that everyone's favorite CGA coaster is Flight Deck/Top Gun, but honestly, I enjoy Demon a lot more. It's just super fun to ride. I LOVE the two consecutive vertical loops, the thought that you're about to get decapitated as you drop into the second cavern, and the corkscrew right after. Overall just a very fun ride. Even though it's the oldest coaster at CGA, the turn-around time is pretty quick.<//review>< Pictures>

There's really never a long line, but the hill is below average and make sire to straighten your head during the loops and heartline roll, or youll get a concussion from the seat playing ping pong with your head.< /review>

When visiting San Rafael, this coffee shop is exactly what is needed after a 70 mile bicycle ride. Such a relaxing atmosphere, location is perfect, outside seating, bicycle friendly and such an amazing friendly staff!
Suggestions: Latte, Hot Chocolate! This place is so comfortable, I have to remind myself about the long bicycle ride back to Fremont! I give them 10  stars if I could! I highly recommend this place to everyone in town and anyone who visits San Rafael!< /Text>

Fantastic! INSIDE seating (Spring 2021) Great ☕ coffee. "In-house roasting" done at Berkeley Co-op where Joe Carlo & Saandra do their own roasting.  Music. Friendly young staff. Locally baked muffins. Gifts. Pink 🦉 Owl t-shirts. Artsy & comfy inside. Outside seating as well. Most of all, a gracious place to gather with friends AND to meet interesting 😉 new acquaintances! (West End shopping center, near 4th&3rd Y in the road, headed to San Anselmo. Next to Taco Bell) Stop & get coffee 7am to 5pm. Closed evenings.(Dang!) ☕ ☕ ☕<//Text>

<Text>A cool spot with plenty of parking. They have A LOT of merch or “swag” which was interesting, but I did pick up a sticker. I wanted a french press but neither person working knew how to make one, but they offered me a Chemex Pour Over instead - it was just okay. All in all, I know they’re just starting out but for a Saturday morning the workers weren’t as personable, helpful, or competent as would have been ideal.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdcjJ-MMVJ0Vn64IqGXO982oEmGc91H8cNNoSV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

<Text>Absolutely love this place!!! The coffee is delicious and the baristas are so friendly. I always want to try something new here so I just let the baristas make me something they recommend. Never disappoints! The new outdoor set up and patio is so nice to get some work done and enjoy the sunshine (or shade), and dog friendly! The owners are very sweet and always there making sure their customers are happy. This is my favorite coffee shop in Marin and I love introducing my friends to this great new place!! Can’t wait to come back!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1598922973349, 'text': 'Ty Jessica we love to see you when you’re down this way'}</response><GmapID>0x8085973f84fdec23:0xc71b2ee09cab23c9</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1598636376396<//Date><Text>When I was in town visiting, this place was exactly what I needed. Such a relaxing atmosphere, the coffee and treats are out of this world, and super friendly!
I had a regular cup of joe with oatmeal creamer and mochi doughnuts were one of a kind! I felt so energized after leaving such a creative and comfortable place! I give them over 5 stars and highly recommend this place to everyone in town and anyone who vists this beautiful place called San Rafael! Wish they had spots like this back home!</Text></record>

This has been my new go-to spot since they opened earlier this year! So. Good. It’s a super quick drive from my studio, so it quickly became a daily ritual. I’m so sad I haven’t been able to make it over as much since the shutdown (I live farther up north). Whenever I’m in the area, I’m sure to stop by. Not only is the coffee always fantastic, but everyone there is always a delight. The employees always have great conversation, and the owners, Saandra and Joe are absolutely wonderful souls. You can tell they care so much about their business. From the coffee, to the customers, to the community. They’re so attentive, and have really created such a lovely space. I can’t recommend Pink Owl enough!

P.s. THE MOCHI DONUTS. That is all.</text>

<text>This is my new favorite coffee stop in San Rafael! I love that they support breast cancer research and are limiting use of straws! Their staff is friendly and they have set up outdoor seating.

New place worth checking out in San Rafael. I loved my latte. The setup is really nice and they have many board games and books. I’m sure to have coffee there again.< /review>

<rating>4< /rating><text>I came way late in the afternoon when it's not the best time to check it out. It's in a discomforting area (parking lot full of hangouts) as far as the coronavirus is concerned. Since I was on an errand run in the area, I stopped here out of curiosity due to its relationship with a business more local to my North San Rafael neighborhood. Place is stylistically decorated and the late afternoon coffee girl had a great smile in her eyes and huge burst of energy.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>This coffee shop is such a gem!! First off: the coffee is delicious, the shop has a warm and inviting feel, the service is wonderful, and the owners are the absolute sweetest. You will not regret going here for your morning or afternoon coffee. The icing on the cake is that some of their proceeds go to breast cancer research. Looking forward to many more cups of coffee here!<//review></record>

What a lovely place! My mocha was on point and the baked goods were delicious. Had a Matcha mochi muffin and pumpkin walnut cookies-so good! Thank you to the very nice owners for being open a such a challenging
time.< /Text>

<Review>The hazelnut toasted coffee with oat milk is BOMB AF<//Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>I have been to Pink Owl Coffee 2 times so far. The place is very cozy with cool vibe. Many comfortable tables, chairs and sofas. There are also books and board games. The coffee is great. The Mochi muffins from 3rd culture bakery in Berkeley are awesome. The staff is very nice. This place is a great addition to San Rafael, West End area.

Tried Vanilla Lavender Latte with Oat Milk and it was so good. The Ube Doughnut Muffin was also yummy!<//text>< gmap_id>

I love walking my dog here. Off leash, but she's a good little pups.
Sometimes coyotes show up. I've seen one before. One out of 30 times.
The trails are great. Parking is always available. (During the week)<//Review>

Ample parking, clean, lots of picnic  tables and grills, quiet paths with lots of butterflies in early summer with quiet paths, lots of activities to do. Go to the east bay parks website to get the most information. $5 parking, swimming registration online, etc.< /Text>

Pretty nice park area, I got a bit lost but once I was on the chabot-garin trail it was a nice hike up into the five canyons area.  Very nice view once you get to the top. It can be a bit challenging at some areas.<//review>

It's a wonderful park tucked away in a Hayward neighborhood.  Great place for long walks around the lake or through the mountains.  There is usually people around also walking themselves or their dogs. It's just a really nice park.  The swim hole is closed now due to COVID but the bathrooms are open..< /text>

I personally love this trail, and once you get to the best part... it's actually pretty cool, there's a hidden treasure which is where you will find the the waterfall. I absolutely love this hike, it's not too bad. The hike is a little steep downhill; but if you have the right tennis shoes you'll be ok. The trail is a good ways down which means get ready for the hike back up, but I enjoy this local gem for sure.<//text>

<Text>I have never disliked Don Castro!!! My first review had to be a typo. I LOVE, LOVE,💘 here. I first heard about it when my family went with my daughter's summer camp, Girl's Inc. in 2017.  Ever since, we have went back every summer!! Of course until this summer😢!!!! I tell everybody about it: they have life guards, big umbrellas that are near the water in the sand. They also have BBQ grills by grassy areas that's shaded by trees, and another area with grills, a lot of benches and tables like for a party or get-together that's also shaded. Also, to go into the deep area, the lifeguard must test you to make sure you can swim good!! Parking is good, I've never had to pay, and the price to get in is very reasonable!! I have seen all ages there, and everyone was having a ball!!👍👍👍< /Text><Name>Yoshika Russell< /Name></record>

Great little spot for fishing, quiet and quaint. The pond is very shallow. Although last week there were a lot of fishermen all around the pond because trouts had just been planted there, it was difficult to find a spot to fish comfortably.< /Review>

<Review>I grew up going to don Castro on hot summer days. It was fun to go back as an adult and remember how hot that sand gets. Fun times, busy waters, fighting for shade.

Unfortunately I came in a bad time to try to swim in the makeshift Lagoon..
I guess early in the season. Be careful of certain people that are doing certain illegal fishing things to take out the fish plant and the park rangers need to be aware of that.
Otherwise quiet and peaceful and still a beautiful place.
Come by in the spring or fall time especially when the weather is great and you're going to have a lot of open picnic tables and BBQ Pits available.
Check in with the local Rangers to make sure you can do that.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPahINan1rupJYDDhQR9xuGxGsi6DxUXaNWya-i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f93b2576ee8c7:0x7995aedcf984c4b7<//gmapID></record>

I have been going to this place for a couple of decades. Lots of trees, a small lake to fish in and benches so you can picnic.
In my opinion it's maintenance has sadly been neglected the last few years. Plenty of workers they just seem to mostly stand around talking with each other.
And the park police drive through the parking lot and don't even get out of their vehicles.</review>

Decent park. Has limited trails for hiking and a pond for fishing. Didn’t seem very well maintained but gets the job done.< /Review>

<Text>I love this place, I always take walks here. It's a nice looking walk but not too long or strenuous. And close to my house, so i can feel like I'm escaping the world for a minute, but it's only 5 min away.< /Text>< Name>

<review>The hike going east of Woodroe around the reservoir is beautiful. The best views are from the South side of the reservoir in the morning. Don't go on the trail West of Woodroe. It is not maintained at all and you may run into homeless encampments.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Don Castro is a great place to picnic and swim when the lagoon is open. There are quite a few picnic areas scattered around the park.
There is a changing are inside the restrooms next to the lagoon entrance.
There are trails with a moderate difficulty level.
It's a hot spot for fishing and they stocked the lake recently (April 2019) with 750 lb of trout. Day permits are $5.
There is a $5 fee to park on most weekends in the summer and major holidays (except Thanksgiving/Christmas). It's free during weekdays.
If the park were bigger, had more to see or do, I'd rate it higher.<//Text>< pictures>

Very shallow lagoon that also has a deep end. I like it over cull canyon because the shallow area is much larger so it feels safer for the little ones. Admission is around $3 for adults and $2 for kids. $5 parking fee. Free umbrellas at the lagoon but very few so get there early. Grassy area with picnic tables and grills some have to be reserved though.</review>

Come when geese aren't around. The water temperature was ok, but there were pieces of goose poop floating in the water. They have many picnic tables and a large changing are too. It's a pretty good option for those who don't want to drive all the way out to the beach.<//text>

<Text>We loved visiting this swimming area! It has a lovely lawn area that's nice to put down a blanket and umbrella and relax. There are nearby grilling areas (outside of the swim area) for a cook out. You'll need to pass a swim test to use the whole swimming pool, but I just waded out to my knees anyway.

The charge to swim is inexpensive, and the bathroom/changing rooms are nice and clean.

Beware, on summer weekends this place is PACKED. Also, parking has a small fee as well.< /Text>< userid>

<review>Wonderful park ful of cultural history. It is rocommended that you stop by Hayward Historical Museum first and get your bearings. Get a good appreciation for Don Castro and his legend. Did he really just disappear or is his whole lineage in Chile as some believe? Discuss it while you are munching on Val's Burgers down the street...<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>A nice little natural nook in our part of the woods. The park is well-maintained, with good trails for bikers and hikers. The man-made lake is great for summertime fun for your kids, with full shower and picnic facilities. Note that the park is a little understaffed, so be nice to the overworked folks who man the place. A side perk is there are many days when we've not have to pay for entry fees during daytime hours (because the booth was closed).< /Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< pics>

<Text>This Hidden Gem is an Local Favorite for swimming, fishing, barbeques, parties and hiking. The lake is very clean and always has adequate Life Gaurds on staff as well as Park Rangers and Cleaning Staff. The bathrooms and showers are large and there are plenty of very large changing stalls that can accommodate a parent and several small children. The snack bar isn't always open but most people pack coolers, picnics and barbecues. There are covered areas that can be reserved but many people bring their own pop ups and tents. There is a wonderful family atmosphere. Not only is the entrance handicapped accessible, there is a ramp that can take a wheelchair all the way down to the lake.

The lake was stocked with 500 pounds of fish in June 2018. There is a pier but most people bring their lawn chairs and post up under the trees. A fishing permit is required and can be purchased at the entrance to the swimming area. You do have to pay to park during swim season and a large part of the parking area is unpaved. This affected my rating.

If you haven't been, or haven't been in a long time, you are in for a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this park.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f93b2576ee8c7:0x7995aedcf984c4b7<//Gmap_id></record>

<review>Great and nice picnic place. There are lot of picnic area and pre designated bench available. However if you don't get one you can still go and just have you own spot near a tree or a small pond :).

We went during spring time and swimming area was not open yet, but still enjoyed a lot of nice nad open space. Also there is lot of shade so you can always get a spot you like.

All in all a good place.

* Good for Easter egg hunt also :)</review>< Pictures>

This place is awesome. We are  been visiting since 25 years ago.
I like it cause they have 3 floor parking lot. The place is very clean,Safety and nice environment adding
a plus a bus stop. Also the entrance charge is ship,ship,ship😊
We love this place.🃏💟👌<//text>

<Text>Interesting spot with a swimming pool that's meant to look like a lake, which I found novel, but its not the best for swimming and can be a bit rocky, uncomfortable to walk into. Very ackwardly designed swim lanes, hard to swim in.

Great for families: inexpensive admission ($3 for adults, $2 for children) and a good crowd of people, but not overly crowded. Tons of children, who as a group seemed to me to be exceptionally well-behaved. No food or water available for purchase so recommend bringing a cooler as it can get very hot out there. You can bring in your own food/ beverages, but no glass or alcohol.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Don Castro Lake is a very difficult body of water to fish in.  Although, it is picture perfect to look at especially from the dock, because the water tends to be murky , fishing is quite challenging.  Access to water is also far from the parking lot.  Restroom facility is clean but far from the dock.  Portables are not cleaned out everyday so, it tends to look disgusting.  The facilities people are very nice and the grounds are kept pretty clean with no visible trash.  There is a lagoon that becomes accessible to the public during the summer that's probably worth a visit.  Similarly, during a scheduled fish plant, the lake generates large size catches.  Anglers are generally nice and civil to each other.  However, because the dock or the lake is small, crossing lines is very likely.  So be prepared to be confronted if you fish there.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Have to be there early to find a shaded area. Kinda sucks that you have to pay for parking and then to swim. Altough it is nice to cool off on a hot summer day.< /review>

The trails connect to the the larger Chabot to Garin trail system if you want to do a longer more challenging hike. I recommend getting the East Bay Regional Park annual pass so you can park and use the swimming area for free. Annual pass will get you into several other parks, too. Well worth it.</Text>< Pictures>

A little something for everybody here. Have a picnic, swim in the pound, fish in the creek, or hike around. Don Castro is a beautiful shady area in the hills that is close to the city, but feels removed from it.< /Text>

It's a family tradition for 27 years now it's a must every 4th of July to be at Don Castro enjoying the day with family. Park workers are courtoeuse and alert on any given problem brought to their attentions.I must say Don Castro has came along ways upgrading for the better.<//Review>

There's a nice lake and a separate swimming area. You can ask for a map at the entrance to the swimming area and take a 1 hour hike around the lake. Dogs are allowed in the park and on the hiking trails but not into the swimming area.< /review>

It's really sad that this place has turned into  one big homeless encampment! It is creepy to walk there alone. I found a syringe in the parking lot & have seen homeless folks coming out of the trees & bushes. But then again where else do they have to go....< /Review>

<Text>Went on the 4th of July and as expected tons of people were there (over a 1000 I heard). Sadly only 1 person at the gate taking tickets, so there was a constant line of 50 - 100 people to get in that took about 30 minutes to stand in line. Large area of sand and grass with shade on the outside fence. Lots of BBQ stands and tables. Lake/Pool is concrete on the bottom lined with sand. 2 levels of swimming, 1 for kids and another for swimmers deeper in. Parents are told to be near their parents at all times and lifeguards are a stickler for this (they'll go find a parent and give a lecture). Water is murky but cool.< /Text>< pictures>

This pool sucks ass. They made so many people stand in line for two hours just to tell them they cant get in because they're at full capacity, instead of informing people at the entrance that the pool is almost at its limit they made them wait in line.<//text>

<text>Love this outdoor sand pool, because it's a pool that is made out to be like a lake. It had a very good filtration system taht u can feel. Could use a little more sand in some places but diffantly will keep coming back.</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Hours from 11:00 am to 6 pm
They charge 3 dlls per person
children 2 dlls.

It is worth paying, it is clean and there are a lot of lifeguards who constantly watch the children entering the lake. There are grills and buckets to deposit the ash and charcoal remains.

(Original)
Horarios de 11:00 am a 6 pm
Cobran 3 dlls por persona
niños 2 dlls.

Vale la pena pagar, esta limpio y hay mucho personal salvavidas que constantemente vigila a los niños que ingresan al lago. Hay asadores y cubetas para depositar la ceniza y restos de carbón.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It’s a beautiful place to enjoy with your family or go a large walk, the lake is amazing you can swim, the water is clean and clear super nice place but it doesn’t have enough grills to prepare a BBQ. This is a nice place to enjoy with the family or on long walks, the lake is great the water is clean, clear and a beautiful place, but it does not have enough grills to make hoe meat.
