Great location, clean and comfortable.  The shower could be an issue for some.  Water was not super hot ever. The pictures online are slightly deceptive.  This place is not nearly as cute as it is in the pictures.  It is adequate, clean and walkable if you are in good shape. But, for the price you may find better lodging. Also, the lobby is closed, no cleaning service, no coffee, limited staff if you want anything....all supposedly COVID related, but still we stayed at our hotels on this trip without these restrictions.  The hot tub is closed.  Patio area is small and slightly dated.</Review>

<Text>Wow. Just wow! After a long day driving up Big Sur, we were greeted by the most amazing helper, Orlando. He helped us checked in and gave us a very detailed overview of all the spots to see in Carmel by the sea. The rooms were so charming and we enjoyed our breakfast boxes by the gorgeous fire pit. Orlando was the key to our great stay at Hotel Carmel and, to be blunt, he deserves a promotion. We will be back hotel Carmel!<//Text><Response>None</Response><rating>5< /rating><user_id>103136107241314640668< /user_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

<review>The hotel location is great and the shared outdoor spaces are really nice. However, we were really disappointed with our room. We reserved a Delux King and it was not as pictured. It was really small and dark with one tiny window and one chair - it was pretty tight for 2 people! Also, we were right off the shared courtyard so our room was really loud (and we had to keep the shutters closed otherwise everyone in the courtyard would be able to see into our room making the room even that much darker). We were looking forward to a relaxing weekend where we could sleep in, but the noise in the courtyard would wake us up before 7AM. We asked if we could change rooms, but the hotel was fully booked. Based on the price (and the photos!), I was expecting a much nicer room and we were really bummed.<//review>< Pics>

Adorable and cozy hotel just a few blocks off of Ocean Drive. Enjoyed my stay here, but only rating 3 stars for the late check-in (our room wasn’t ready until after 5pm when check-in is slotted for 3pm) and the lack of hot water (no one wants to take a cold shower when you’re paying $300+ a night).< /Review>

What a lovely boutique hotel! We will definitely stay here next time we are in Carmel. Walking distance to everything (about 15 min light stroll to the main beach and a short 5 min walk to all the shops/stores). Hospitality was great during our stay. Check in and checkout was easy (covid times).</text>

<text>A bit of a let down staying at the hotel Carmel. The staff was great but for the price of the room I would not recommend staying here. The room was extremely small and you could hear every movement and conversation from upstairs, the walls are very thin. For the $22 resort fee you get a parking spot, an empty hot tub and a grocery store muffin and yogurt for breakfast. Overall it was a bit disappointing.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Small rooms, thin walls, horrible service. Stayed in Carmel for 8 days at three different hotels. This was hands down one of the worst hotel experiences we had that week if not throughout the past decade while visiting Carmel. We stayed at the sister hotel Playa de Carmel (which was great) and decided to visit Hotel Carmel to enjoy the hot tub and outdoor fireplace. On arrival we went to inspect the amenities only to find an empty spa and firepit/fireplace that the staff refused to turn on for us even though we saw another couple enjoying it a few minutes earlier. When booking the hotel the front desk was glad to mention the hot tub but failed to include details of it's inoperability due to Covid-19. Once checked in to the room, we were disappointed at the lack of space and super cramped bathroom not to mention paper thin walls. After 1 night, we decided to cut our 3 night stay short and booked a room @ Svengaards across the street. While not as 'nice' it had ample room and friendlier service. As we were packing up ready to leave, the staff were loudly conversing about how happy they were to have our room check out. Super unprofessional especially when we apologized for the early check out and personally tipped the lady @ the front desk $100. AVOID. Difficult to mess up a hotel stay in Carmel but this one managed to pull it off!</review>< time>

Spacious suite with fireplace inside and another steps from front door. Comfortable, clean and relaxing a great spot to unwind and recharge. Recommend upgrade and add breakfast at sister hotel, well worth it for fresh omelet made to order and dining overlooking gorgeous grounds. Very friendly staff all around.< /Review>

No AC or fan, windows cracked open but that did nothing to relieve the stuffy ness of our very small hotel room.  Bathroom was small and no tub space.  $620 per night was a huge waste of money.  1 star for friendly staff and one for a clean room and decent bed.   Also terrible parking lot that you have to back out of with any space you pick.< /Review>< Response>

Love the overnight oats with fresh berries for breakfast and Lavazza coffee in the room.  The bagel bar is great with the variety of cream cheese flavors (hello pesto!) and delicious jams.  Wine hour features great labels, both white and red. The fire pit is a great place to sip some wine and have a conversation.  I'll definitely come back. Thanks Hotel Carmel!</Text>< UserId.>

< Review>
Stay somewhere truly dog friendly. Terrible customer service and clarity around their policies. Hotel Carmel came up as a pet friendly hotel. While booking online there was no indication that some rooms would not be suitable so I booked my room. I called to inform the hotel that I would have a dog, since there are usually additional charges. I was informed that the room I was in was not pet friendly and they had no pet friendly rooms available. So now less than a week before my trip they graciously canceled my room and I was left looking for a hotel that is truly pet friendly. It is shameful that they look to list themselves as pet friendly but then only reserve a small fraction(queen rooms only) of their rooms to accommodate pets with no clarity on their website. I was treated poorly and dismissed on the phone when I suggested they update their reservation system to indicate  what rooms are available for pets. They were able to clearly indicate other specifications on their rooms, why not this. Both reservations and the supervisor I asked to speak with just told me it’s not their area, it’s someone else’s job. Not helpful and completely avoidable.</Review>

Beautiful hotel, perfect location, a short walk to downtown Carmel restaurants and shops. They provide a generous happy hour and continental breakfast (which you pay for as part of the amenity fee). The hotel doesn’t have any air conditioning, but they have ya an oscillating fan, and we had a very comfortable sleep. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Great stay, parking was never an issue for us as mentioned in previous reviews. Staff was accommodating, rooms were clean and relaxing. Hotel Carmel offers privacy yet still being within walking distance to everything Carmel has to offer. We traveled here for a few nights for our babymoon and then headed up to San Francisco and immediately wanted to come back to Hotel Carmel. There’s nothing like it-will stay here next time we come back!< /review>

Visiting from UK, we had a relaxing stay. Room clean, a bit basic but it had all we wanted. We had a fireplace room and really enjoyed the sitting area outside. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was also good. A limited choice but actually it was enough. Would suggest that the peanut butter should not be near the nut free spread. Parking is a bit limited. The town itself is very relaxed and laid back. We had a great time. Off to Frisco for the second part of our holiday, I suspect Carmel has given us a great introduction to the Californian way of life.</Text>

<review>Lovely clean room No AC, not really needed by the ocean, but our room was right near the beautiful courtyard and fire pit and hot tub. If we closed the windows no option for air( we were offered a fan) if they were open it was loud.there are plantation shutters so they do not provide privacy  and room for air circulation at the same time. The hot tub and courtyard close at 930/10, but I definitely fell asleep and woke up to people talking :(<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
The location, landscaping, and design of this hotel is spectacular. The amenity of waking up everyday to their beautiful courtyard filled with succulents, Talavera tile, luscious vines, a fire pit circled with soft Adirondack chairs, fireplace, and a jacuzzi is worth every penny to me! But then there’s breakfast that for us included a choice of bagels with six or seven spreads, overnight oats with berries, yogurt, granola, and/or breakfast burritos. There was also always coffee, delicious OJ, and water. Their lobby is charming and Brophy’s tavern is wonderful and a must. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The room was great as well. We will most definitely be back! Thank you Hotel Carmel for giving us an unforgettable honeymoon stay!!< /Review>

We had a very nice overnight stay at the Hotel Carmel, conveniently located in walking distance of the shops and restaurants of Carmel. Very charming and comfortable. I give four rather than 5 stars because breakfast is quite limited, they give you very small pours at the wine hour, parking is first come first serve in a small lot, and the hot tub area is super dark! They need a light or two for safety in that area. In terms of the limited breakfast and wine hour, we recently experienced both ideas executed just a little better at Pacific Gardens Inn in Pacific Grove.<//review>

Staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was ridiculously cozy and comfortable. The adjacent pub under the lobby on the street level was fun and tasty for a snack.

Hotel Carmel is super cute. We stayed here for two nights and it was great for the most part. The hotel is only two blocks away from the downtown area. You can walk to the most wine tasting rooms within 5-10 minutes.The only thing that I wish it was better was the bathroom size. Also, it wouldnt hurt if the staffs were friendlier. I had to find out about the resort fee charge on my credit card statement instead of at the check-out time.< /review>

The hotel was renovated last year and this was our first time staying.  We frequently visit Carmel and have stayed at a lot of properties in town.  Hotel Carmel did a great job with the renovations.  The hotel still has Carmel charm, but the beds were amazingly comfortable, nice TVs, and great courtyard with fire pit.  The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our stay.</Text>

Staff was great, but no a/c, and weather was warm. They brought a fan, but we were under impression that the hotel was air conditioned. Had to sleep with windows open.  Only about 17 parking spaces for 27 rooms. Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but we had ants in bathroom. Breakfast was bagels or yogurt and granola. Bed was comfy. Nothing very special about this establishment.</review>

Charming space & ambiance (fire pit/outdoor fireplace). Rooms are clean & well-kept, but the walls are paper thin! Could hear my neighbors arguing nightly, and if I could easily hear them, they must have heard me. Unfortunately, they couldn't change my room, and I was there for work. I do not recommend staying in a room with an adjoining door, unless you're going with family and don't mind hearing everything from phone calls to arguments. Not the best place for quiet.<//Text>

Thanks for asking for input,  there were positives and needs improvements which ended up netting an average rating in my experience. Spacious, clean and modern room and staff were great, parking was tight, value was lower than average based on rate, fees (which were mentioned, to cover breakfast) were high based on value- perhaps better as optional,  and noise levels were high from outside normal conversations which seemed to permeate through the wall and closed windows,  car doors opening and closing, as well as neighbor units when bathroom facilities were used. I wear ear plugs to block noise for sleeping, they were not effective enough.<//text>

This is a nice hotel. It is very comfortable and it is in the middle of town close to everything. They need to work on controlling noise here though. On a Friday between noon and 4pm, very loud guests were speaking, almost yelling, in the patio area. When they finally shut up, some one spent an hour with a blower or something. Very noisy. The manager should consider how stressfull all this noise is for guests and try to contain some if it.</text>

<Text>We had planned on a family reunion just before Thanksgiving at the Hotel Carmel, and we ended up inviting a few other friends to turn it into a celebration of family, marriage, and fun! Hotel Carmel was wonderful to work with and made all of the guests feel special. Using all 30 of the Hotel Carmel’s rooms, we were excited to have the patio with fireplaces and other communal spaces for friends and family to chat late into the night.

A few of my cousins were happy to re-tell how they kept Brophy’s open an hour past closing while watching a football game. Friends regaled how happy they were to wake up with a cup of Nespresso and the ocean view. A great uncle thanked the staff for cleaning his room after he later decided to switch with another guest for less walking. I appreciated the staff’s quick return with ice and a long table when my brother decided to add a 3 year old’s birthday to the list of celebrations.

Renting out an entire hotel for 3 nights might seem crazy, but I can confidently say it was worth it at Hotel Carmel. To make matters even more complicated, the Paradise Fire hit northern California at the same time of our reservation. As a result of families fleeing south, Hotel Carmel was completely booked before and after our event. I commend the hotel staff for flipping 30 rooms in a day - twice in one week.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1548977096548, 'text': 'Alissandria, it sounds like you had an amazing family gathering and a truly special celebratory occasion!

This is essentially a motel, charging luxury hotel prices. For over $400 per night, they provided a basic room overlooking the parking lot. Shockingly, the hotel does not even have air conditioning, unheard of for even the lowest budget lodging, and something they don’t tell you on that snazzy website of theirs or when you make a reservation. To make matters worse, the windows are very old, with non functioning cranks that prevent you from opening and closing them. When we complained about how uncomfortable the room was, we were simply told that the windows were very old and needed replacing (no kidding). Breakfast consisted of a tray of bagels and some yogurt cartons. As others have noted, they tack on a resort fee to the already high published price, despite the fact that this is not disclosed in advance, and there are no resort amenities to speak of. In many years of traveling, I’ve never received so little value for my money.< /Text>

We found the hotel somewhat difficult to communicate with when booking, but persevere - it's worth it.

Tip: make sure you book a room with a fire if you're visiting in winter.< /review><gmapID>0x808de66afdb65255:0x2d2e25e00ac8706<//gmapID><Date>1486611113406</Date><user>108895914606318888753</user><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I have stayed here once before and the property is in a prime location, Brophy's Tavern is an awesome pub with a great bar tender, the beds are very comfortable, the room is spacious with a fireplace, and the bathrooms are newly remodeled.

The CUSTOMER SERVICE from YASSER M. was above and beyond, though. I have a wedding party staying here at the end of the month and he spent an hour with me on the phone making sure everything was perfect. I am in the services industry, and his level of commitment to my happiness should be commended. Not many people would have been as patient and kind as he would have been; we had to arrange nearly 15 rooms for different guests traveling at different times.

If you are staying in Carmel (by the Sea) and you need a place to call home for a couple days, look for Hotel Carmel and Yasser - they will not disappoint.</text>

<Review>It's not bad, and the rooms are decent, but it's not worth for the $$$. If I'm spending $400/night on a room, I expect luxuries such as more-than-single-ply toilet paper and housekeeping that doesn't take 4 hrs to respond.</Review></record>

Clean.. town itself was kind of empty and not much night life. But good for older people who just want to relax.<//review>

Unser Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel hat uns gut gefallen. Das Zimmer war gross und gräumig, leider war in unserem Raum die Toilette ein bisschen ungünstig konstuiert. Grosser Plus Punkt war das Kamin. Anzahl Parkplätze eher knapp berechnet.<//review>

Schöner kann man an der Westküste kaum untergebracht sein. Nicht nur der wundervolle Ort erfüllt alle Wünsche, sondern auch dieses Hotel.Die Zimmer sind groß... das Personal sehr freundlich und die Außenanlage gemütlich.Alles super!</review>

Nice BnB but noisy indeed. Ceiling and side walls are extremely thin and you hear everything. Our room was not spacious but actually as decribed so I cannot complain. Rooms are nicely equipped with Nespressos and minibar. The matraces at least for us where a real nightmare way too soft. We liked the location close to the shopping areas. Ocean is far away though. All in all I probably would select this hotel again although they did not do anything wrong.</Text>

Good sized rooms and comfortable beds. Hotel is situated around the many restaurants and boutiques in Carmel. Small but adequate pool. This is a typical well run cosy Inn that is to be found all along PCH1...< /text>

2 visits in a row they have messed up my orders. Instead of giving a sandwich that I ordered they give me 2 of the same sandwich, but still charge me for the more expensive sandwich. They stop making hot sandwiches at 9:30pm. Can't get orders right!!!!. And they stop making shakes at 9:30 as well.<//review>

Always a good experience here. The only complaint I have is from a recent experience where I ordered online went to pick it up and was told they were out of salami. I changed my order to the Italian sandwich (even though they were out of salami) only to be told they were also out of mortadella. I know no restaurant is perfect. I was disappointed, but the gentleman was nice about it. It wasn't his fault.  Would be nice if the lack of certain ingredients reflected online before taking your money.<//Review>

Staff so professional and accommodating.
Took sandwiches to Terry Hanck Band at the California State Fair and they loved the food.

<Review>Not sure why but sandwich makers have gotten very, slow. Used to be, that your ability to speed through the making of the sandwich, all with a smile and the ability to make correct change, was what defind you you as a quality employee. Not anymore. Food is still tasty however.<//Review>< Response>

A'lam the business owner is such a nice guy, he made us the best grape fruit bowl hookah. Just amazing. Nice hookah lounge, really chill and friendly. Good prices and great service. I love the self service tea and coffee system here. It makes it much faster and easier for the customers.
10/10 and recommended.
Also very clean restrooms which is a huge plus.

It was a commute to get here and it's worth it. They know their hookah, they have the Khalil mamoon hookahs and disposable hoses as well as the starbuzz hookahs. I'm impressed to find this on the west coast. Back in NY we have great places but this is the best I've visited on the west coast.<//Review><Date>1569038436203<//Date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl-IxLXGy1AXgPIC-jLmpg5CKnjEDv1N3lhaOM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqLX5Rn0sKIMMn3v5qlNbVcPlzcvCwvEVWUhud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM92J3YYIBGPxxG1nzmtzvMs3oFUzmhK1lJQUGh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWP5w8totUiFseuMkWSuBXE5vnrrc3vUPp_8Js=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEYYFFlq7Za3wJNk75MUIJsxkIBiIP_omDWKqg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><gmap_id>0x808f79d7488dd6af:0xd60b0bbf3cd5b2e1<//gmap_id>< user>

THIS PLACE IS A JOKE..save your money and go to another place where you will spend more and at least get respect..The guy that works there got ZERO customer service and showed us attitude from the time we walked in. We ended up leaving without ordering anything.< /text>

There are options to have a fruit bowl, premium hookahs, tea, and there are TVs.<//Review><response>{'time': 1536397485331, 'text': 'Thank you For your Feedback! It’s your Lounge,  Always Welcome.\n\nPARADISE MANAGEMENT'}<//response></record></dataset><record>

< review>
We visited this place on June 10 there was no ac no fan working and the temp was above 102 degrees it was in the afternoon cuz we have to stop to replenish our energy the workers kept apologizing cuz it’s rare to be that hot in the summer but still as a respect to ur customers u should have ac going for those who smoke inside the tender overcharged above the listed price on the menu they offered us free cold water cuz of the weather but still that doesn’t mean u have a hookah bar with no venting or ac system and it’s a quite big lounge not small< /review>
<Response>{'time': 1575078932103, 'text': 'Thank you!  We appreciate your Feedback!\nI’m sorry you had a unpleasant time at our Hookah Lounge. We work and will work our best to please our Loyal Customers.  We hope we can give you better experience.\nWe have one of the best air/smoke ventilation system on the peninsula, which works great! Its not an easy experience to feel and not your problem as well!  But this was a very rare time (3days) of history for the Bay Area to get this kind of heat. For all residents of peninsula have encountered this situation and are mostly resolving it.  We are getting a new AC system put in soon, so that we can provide nothing less then a great experience for our Loyal customers!\nThank you\nParadise Management'}</Response><Rating>1< /Rating><date>1560438071998< /date>< Pictures>

We stopped in to Paradise Hookah to kill some time before picking up a friend at the airport.  Tesh was very attentive and eager to give us the best hookah experience possible.

Reasonable price, quick service, long-lasting hookah (no refill needed for an hour and a half, 2 people).

The interior was really dark, with only dim lights around the walls, kinda like a club.</Review>

We go for lunch almost once a week. Awesome and fresh food all thr time in these crazy times.
Chicken Biryani, Goat Mughlai, Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken THE Best on town.
Large portions and priced well.
I wish them the best. Keep doing excellent work.</Text>

Got the 2+1 biriyani based on an offer in a local newspaper. Chicken and mutton biriyani was alright but the shrimp biriyani was spoiled and smelled really bad. I'd be hesitant to try this place again.<//review>

Ordered Goat Briyani through Yelp Takeout,  the food i got and what's on the description weren't same. It was some Old and Cold Vegetable Briyani with Mutton Curry with Bones, the mutton pieces and the rice tasted totally different. Totally horrible and not clean, hopefully i don't get sick. Not Worth the Money.

I would never suggest this place to any of my friends and family.< /Review>

Food had no taste with exception of Idli Vada and Sambhar. Tea was excellent and hence 3 stars. Clean, good location and lots of space. Overall ok to eat if you have no other option.<//review>< resp>

<name>Honey Luxe< /name><review>This place smells!! Especially now where there is no dining-in and less people come in and they cook less. When you walk in after they first  open it smells bad. Also they have pile of cooked rice on in the baking pan on the shelf in the backroom and one pan on actual cement floor and both pans uncovered, just sitting there. Health violation for sure. I have pictures and will try to upload. I don't recommend eating here. Dirty and smelly restaurant!< /review>< Rating>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>It's cheaper compared to all other Indian Restaurants around that place. Its not the regular overpowering Indian masala. Now they introduced even cheaper combo plates To-Gos. Buffet is decent and briyani is good. And this is the last place to close in Lunch time, so best for lazy weekends. Had a bad experience on my To-Go Mutton Briyani. They kept the Mutton meat underneath and filled with Chicken briyani rice. Though they gave a huge quantity, taste was not so great. So better to dine in rather than Take out.</Review>< Pictures>

One of the best Indian restaurant in Dublin and San Ramon

I like the Buffet which includes indian tiffins like Idly, Dosa, bonda etc... multiple options for veg as well as non-veg food lovers.

Definitely its a worth try 👍and so friendly staff with very good consumer service< /review>

<review>Today visited this restaurant expecting a good buffet but instead Found a long hair in one of the items which is goat curry . We were already unsatisfied with the unhygienic conditions of the food and the hair part was disappointing. Immediately asked  owner to change pot but he instead tried to cover up with a simple answer. Top of everything he charged us the full amount without any regrets at the end.Hope you take this review seriously and make sure it doesn’t happen again.<//review>< response>

<rate>4< /rate><text>I went here hungry for something fairly healthy and plant-based... they delivered! I wasn’t sure what some of the things were, so a very polite man came to assist me in flavors and deciding what to order. Since I love a selection, I ordered an appetizer assortment platter (which came out very quickly... it was hot and crisp with two different sauces) The gentleman suggested the Thalia dish, which is another variety platter of differently prepared vegetable dishes, but it little tapa-style dishes. They also brought me out some fresh Naan bread and some yogurt to cool down the spiciness a bit🌶🌶! I love 🌶 spicy, and it was all very delicious!! Many bold and opposing flavors were quite tasty! The staff was very accommodating, the food was fresh, very flavorful and satisfying. Only one thing I noticed was that although the bathroom was surprisingly tidy, the walls and fixtures could have been cleaner. Overall, a very nice experience, especially from the family-oriented service.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

This is now Blue Fox.  They also offer Indian cuisine. Advertising may help as it isn't crowded.  Good flavors.  Food to go, menu and buffet.  Good vegetarian selections.<//Review>

Worst food and menu i ever had.  The gulabjaamun sweet is not even cooked properly inside.

The rice is not boiled. When asked, the chef said : entire rice will be like that.< /Review>

We ordered dinner takeout from here because it had the shortest wait time on doordash. Blandest Indian food I’ve ever eaten. Couple hours later and my tummy doesn’t feeel good. No wonder other people weren’t ordering from here and it had a short wait time. I would not order from here again.< /Review>

I was lured by the name Indian cuisine. But it’s definitely not an Indian.. not a Mediterranean and not an American. Food was pathetic.. meat was uncooked(may be cooked few days back). Dough for the batoora was raw. My family had a very bad dinner this night. I would advise gourmets to never step in to this restaurant.. I paid 60 dollars to learn that it’s worthless one in Pleasanton. I would like to give something in negative.. but no options available< /review>

I wanted to give 0 stars. But, unfortunately it is not available. Also, this is the first ever review.. am so pissed off with what they had in the buffet how vad customer service also the food was. Simple nan was pathetic and infact old that i could not give it to my kids... what a waste of money.. these restaurant owners does not have any responsibility on how to run a restaurent and make an indian food

Man when i asked for fresh nan he just goes and reheats the old nan and brings it. Restaurant owners need to understand that we are still indian and can find which is fresh and which is not.. worst man...< /Review>

This place has solid biryani, seasoned well and packs some heat after a couple chomps.

Their fresh naan is also lovely and you can order it fresh for your table during the lunch buffet.

The main issue with the lunch buffet is that if it's not particularly busy, the food is left to get cold and the overall quality dips rather quickly. Hard naan, lukewarm curry, a lack of dishes, etc.

Still trying to figure out when it's moderately busy as that seems to be the ideal time.<//Text>

Update: April 2019
Food is consistently better for several months now. Great selection of veggie entrees, fresh food is prepared often to replenish steaming pans. Bathrooms need updating, but we assume the restaurant leases the space. Building owner should spend some money to modernize restrooms.

Update - January 2018
Food is fresher now, desserts are back to being good consistency. Naan is at the buffet rather than being brought to the table. Chai tea usually available. Certainly going late in the afternoon means that the food will not be as fresh, I do understand they don't want to keep pans completely filled until 3pm if there are only a few customers left. Price has gone up again to $11.99, so now $13+ with tax. Pretty pricey for a lunch buffet, but quality has improved so it's worth it to us. Bathrooms are still in need of a serious cleaning & need to be stocked more frequently - especially soap. Worrisome that employees use the same bathroom when there's no soap! 4 stars now for better food. -1 for bathrooms.

Update - May 2017: Last few weeks, food is lower quality. Fried dishes have way too much oil, you can see it pooled in the pan! Chai Tea is frequently empty. Rice & pudding desserts are runny. Not sure if there's a new cook, or just less attention toward quality, but last 3 visits were a disappointment. Really sad, because this was a favorite spot until now. Lowered rating to 3 stars. Hoping to see an improvement soon. Also, bathrooms are a mess - no paper towels, soap needs to be refilled, seat liners empty for weeks, needs a good bleach cleaning. Price is now $11 + tax = over $12 for lunch, which wouldn't be so bad if quality were improved, but it's too much for current conditions/quality. (end of edit)

Best Indian buffet by far in the Tri-Valley region & I've tried them all!  Numerous meat dishes as well as vegetarian entrees, rice, naan, gulab jamun/carrot Halwa (desserts), Chai tea. Prices have gone up somewhat over the past year, but it's still reasonable. Easy access from 580/Hacienda expressway. Follow Google directions. Nicely decorated with floral accents, not a "hole in the wall joint" where you wouldn't want to take your boss or a date! Gave 4 stars because food isn't always as fresh these past few months. Took my family there, they were complaining about so little in the pans, and what was there was drying up. Come before 1:30pm or you'll not get freshly prepared food.<//text>

Its the worst experience in terms of buffet in the area. They have the worst butter chicken one can imagine. Food is cold & tasteless. Tried butter chicken, navratan korma,daal makhni, andhra chicken....didn't find even one item worth eating. Eventually I had to settle with curd-rice & kheer. What an irony, went to restaurant to eat curd-rice.<//text>

HORRIBLE and OVERPRICED! Glazed donuts are quite literally air wrapped in dough, with no dough in the middle AT ALL. And they charge a WHOPPING $11 for a dozen. The most I have EVER paid for a dozen donuts with holes is $7.93! And when I say they are flatter than a pancake, I don't mean figuratively...I MEAN LITERALLY! I think their high rating is bogus, and probably entered by themselves and friends and family, because, if I could give them 0 stars, I would. If you want REALLY good, quality donuts, go to Jack's Donuts in Anderson, or if that's too far, then your next bet will be the Donut House on Cypress in the Safeway shopping Center....cheaper too!< /text>

Hands down the best donuts in Redding! Light and airy, unlike a lot of other donut shops in the area that are heavy and greasy!
The shop is run by a super friendly and cheerful family.
I drive from Anderson to get Lucky donuts instead of just getting them somewhere close by!</text>

My husband surprised me with donuts after a bad start to our morning. These were not the typical fare you expect. Looked like a bear claw but it was fruit filled. A chocolate covered bar donut sliced open with cream piped in, nice take on an eclaire. The plain glazed donut was light and airy, and the glaze did not shatter off to the floor when bit into.</text>

< Review>
The yummy soft doughnuts are to be expected with most doughnut shops. This one though also has amazing coffee and fantastic prices! The owner's wife and daughter are so sweet although the man is not quite as charming but he still makes an awesome cappuccino. The place is clean. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the really sweet other lady who works there sometimes... she's awesome but doesn't know how to make coffee and on one occasion charged me too much for a coffee (which I didn't protest because I was running late already). Overall the place is great but the family that owns it needs to train their other girl a little better. I try to only go in when she's not there.</Review>

They know how to make some doughnuts!! Very good and the price is always good. They also sell doughnut holes , and will custom fill doughnuts for you with anything you want. Don't know to many places that do that still.< /Review>

Michelle was great from the beginning and showed us our options from what we told her. She didn’t pressure us at all and allowed us to take our time. She honored all discounts at the time and it was a seamless purchase process. Come to Michelle at Ortho for your mattress needs.</text>

I went to at least 5 mattress stores , Richard was really good, answered all my questions in a simple way, very knowledgeable , very patient, he even stayed after the store hours to make sure that we are comfortable about our purchase and handled  a problem I had with the delivery in a very professional way. When you go there make sure to ask for Richard ,  Thank you for doing your best, contacting the head office to get us the best deal.<//Review>

<text>After owning a ortho mattress for 15 years, I had to go back to purchase my new bed!
I was blown away with all the choices, but Woo helped me budget wise and comfort wise! He went beyond by helping me select lower legs on the bed so my Corgi could jump up on it! I have never enjoyed a bed purchase as much as I did with Woo! He goes beyond for you! So happy with my purchase! Woo you are the best at what you do!</text>< pictures>

The customer service is exceptional - Darlene was very helpful and Christina went 'above and beyond'.  This store has a good selection of mattresses and they will special order items, e.g. headboards, etc.  I had been looking for a headboard but with no success.  I found the one I wanted and, thanks to Christina, she located one for me.

I have been shopping around for a good quality and good price mattress for the past few weeks. Finally today I came to the lagouna hills 23351 location and met with the nice gentleman Austin who was very professional and extremely polite and friendly. He took his time to help us and give us all the details about the product and matched the online pricing for us.
Will definitely refer anyone to this location with Austin’s great service.🙂<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>My husband and I have been shopping for a mattress for some time. We planned on visiting a few stores before deciding on a purchase. Our first stop was suppose to be Sit and Sleep but we decided to go to this Ortho Mattress location instead. We were glad we did! Cameron was excellent in helping us decide which mattress was best suited for us. Cameron was  informative and provided great customer service! There was no need to go shop somewhere else. I plan to purchase new mattresses for the other rooms in our house, I will certainly contact Cameron when the time comes:) Thank you Cameron!!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1514915145912, 'text': 'Cathy Lee Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and kind words with us.

<Text>We came in for a headboard and left with the most amazing bed in the world!!! Dan helped us pick the perfect Ortho hybrid mattress! It has a zero gravity feature that makes you feel like you are in heaven !!! Dan was so nice and helped us the second we walked in. We got a great Labor Day deal and are so happy with our decision. Couldn't have had a better experience.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>If your wondering where good service has gone check out Ortho Mattress in Laguna Hills. (store B) Michael gave me great service and educated me on all the different choices available so I was able to make an informed decision. The next day, after I did my research, I went back and Austin picked up where Michael left off.  I purchased a new bed for our guest room and I will be going back to see them when we are ready to replace our Master Bed... be sure and check them out!< /review>< Pics>

I came to buy a full mattress and wound up getting a twin in addition to the full because the comfort and price were so good. It's nice knowing I didn't buy anything that's going to start disintegrating in 3 years or will put a lot of formaldehyde into my lungs starting the first night I sleep on it. I just had to throw away a mattress less than 4 years old that had those  issues. I got the real deal this time. I'll be back when I get a queen size next year.<//Review>< Time>

I was so tired of sales people directing me to the most expensive mattress, regardless of what I wanted or needed.  Woo took the time to find out exactly what I was looking for and gave me options in a variety of price ranges.  I was so appreciative of his patience and professionalism.  In addition, he knows everything there is to know about mattresses!< /Text>< pics>

<Date>1564190351450< /Date><review>I was not impressed. Ordered the two meat meal. One for my husband, with beef brisket and BBQ chicken. And mine was the beef brisket and pork ribs. Ordered macaroni salad and corn bread for one and potato salad and corn bread on the other. Also ordered two crazy corns. The portions are very large. But more is not always better. The beef brisket is mostly inedible fat. The corn bread has a funny taste. The macaroni salad tastes like macaroni noodles with mayo....and nothing else. The pork ribs were decent. The chicken breast was bland. It was tender but lacked flavor. The best thing about the meal was the crazy corn and potato salad. Would not recommend or return.</review>< rate>

<Text>Great hard working, active, cooking owners. 2 locations. They care about the quality and presentation of their foods.  They have bbq in their name but they are more of a Asian/American Fusion bbq joint.  Yes the food is in steamers to choose from but the turns are quite often.  Food is consistently fresh.  Great salad bar, they make all their own sides, beans, mac&potatoe salad, fried rice, cornbread, etc.  A 3rd rib would be nice for the ribs but overall a great value for your money.  There is no more Tona Romas in town so if you want to spend double and get a bit more of a Traditional bbq then go to Sweet T's.  Otherwise enjoy this place for what it is.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>I saw this place featured on a Facebook page. Thought, well, we will be staying in Windsor, let's check it out.

It doesn't really feel clean inside. I don't know what it is. Just felt weird. You order at the counter. Everything is pre made, and just heated up.  Nothing was fresh.

I liked the beans. I thought the flavor was good. But my hubby did not like them. And vise versa on the Cole slaw. I didn't like it. He did. We both thought the Mac salad was decent. Just bland. We both liked the corn bread.

The meats were old, and weird. The chicken was such an unusual consistency. Like cardboard. It kind of snapped when bent. The ribs were like bark. And the brisket was super fatty.

Definitely not a great meal. I don't think we will be back.< /Text><time>1545541698433< /time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTA0oe8Xs2owblhIIYcpsq6XWbD6ZmyHEMt0xU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV1XAU8l0JhmYEMPlzFCddYfCsEa6f83GzGrpI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLz3wJu3QnMxS2Otwmd4uWrbc4QtaBCfdLoNUy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRX097H0a4SLIt_zhbc9G3CjFhO0DhgfQngjcY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0t0NB88eUXY_LJW5vOHYJgkiDczk1yioBEtcP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRoZkoh0a5k77-2r0n37aX4OP14B6y-Jd7uAQC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVqrQ1I3MM8X8akUm9WWbIHxp4gbareEqeHDdN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhlDjGsuD2FdRW_720zdHKaW3ed-HlRBhCr3SV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><userid>104391725146946372378<//userid>< user_name>

< review>
After reading so many good reviews we decided to give Red Bee a try. It was a Saturday evening. We ordered the Spicy chicken rice bowl, terrayki chicken, BBQ pork and beef combo plate with beans and some corn. When I got there there was only one lady working and she said they didn't have any chicken so there went to of our orders. I got what they did have and went home. The meat was definitely bone dry. The side of rice was tiny. I did love the beans but this won't be enough to get me to return. Unfortunate but luckily we have lots of great restaurants in our area.</review>

<name>Larry Ross< /name><resp>None< /resp><review>Good value for large portions of baked meat, but not really BBQ. No rub or seasonings on the tender ribs leaves them bland and unmemorable. Brisket is tender but very fatty. Pulled pork lacks any distinguishing flavor. Coleslaw was short on dressing and beans were not served hot. Convenient location with clean and pleasant interior.< /review>< Rate>

What a great value for such large portions of good and tasty fall off the bone meats. The Brisket has a wonderful smokey flavor. Quite a variety of sides too. Such wonderful humble service.
I have been long disappointed with the lack of good Barbecue in the area until Red Bee moved in.<//review>

Red Bee bbq has a tasty variety of food. The brisket is very good as well as the BBQ'd chicken, pulled pork and the sides. Prices are amazingly low. You can literally buy a 3 meat combo with 2 sides and feed a small family for under $15.00. There are 2 locations and the food quality between the 2 is consistently very high. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

< Review>
Quaint neighborhood spot. Walk up counter where you choose your meal, pay, sit or go. Friendly staff, fast service, fresh food. The chicken was excellent and so tender. I like their bbq sauce. Their food has a little Asian fusion going on. I have never had fried rice with bbq but it was delish. I had the sliced pork and it was ok. Potato salad was decent but could use some more seasoning. My friend had the chicken bowl with broccoli and fried rice, cleaned his bowl. Prices are great, my meal with drink was $14 and change and enough for 2 meals. I will definitely return to try the beef brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. Will absolutely want the chicken again, so I will be back! Nice, quick, inexpensive meal, but know it is different from traditional American bbq, but that's a good thing if you want something a bit different.<//Review>

<text>I happened to be in Windsor and starving for a good meal so, knowing there was a Red Bee BBQ located here I decided to go check it out. I'm happy I did. Just like the Santa Rosa store the food here was plentiful and delicious. There was more indoor seating available and multiple big screen HD flatscreen TV's to gaze at while eating. The space is cheerful with lots of natural light and the service was speedy, friendly, and helpful. We tried the new promo featuring a plate with all the different meats they had plus one side dish.
All of them were tasty delicious and the price was quite reasonable. I was stuffed and had to get a to go container. If you enjoy BBQ, go & check em out. 😀</text>< Pics>

The food is good, the price is right, and the service is great.  Fed my whole family for less than a McDonald's trip and had leftovers for everyone's lunch the next day.  Not sure what you'll like?  They will let you try samples!<//Review>

Horrible experience. We went for lunch, only to observe the "manager" a young girl with tattoos on her arm and a obvious negative attitude, drop a customer's food product on the ground, pick it up and place it on customers other food. I spoke up and said you can't do that, it's cross contamination . the "manager" got very defensive, and then without changing her gloves grabbed two to go trays to take our order. I told her she needed to change her gioves. She got major attitude, started raising her voice to me, my friend actually left the restaurant because he refused to eat there after seeing her unsafe food handling. I asked her if she was serv safe trained, she refused to answer, she refused to give her name, she refused to give her managers name and she refused to give business office information. But she did say she was human and she makes mistakes, in which I told her she obviously has done this mistake before, they didn't even replace the customers food after it was contaminated by the food that was dropped on ground.
I used to really enjoy the food at this restaurant but now I'm def questioning their food handling safety. If this supposed manager can easily mishandled food and contaminate a customer's food with such ease I can only imagine what happens to the food that we can't see them prepare. I do plan to follow up with health department. I hope this business re examines who they have work for them and who represents them. I contacted the office of the business, and not surprisingly have not gotten a response.<//Review>

In my opinion you get what you pay for, and here, you pay a pretty low amount and get decent bbq. Why they serve it on top of shredded romaine lettuce I will never know. The whole hot lettuce thing is a bit strange. There is a not a lot of consistancy, some meats will taste waaaaaay different day to day. The cornbread is pretty awesome. For cheaper bbq, it's pretty decent.<//text>

Started using Public Storage in Pleasanton and my experience has been awesome. John especially has been very helpful in helping me getting the best unit for my needs. transitioned from a smaller unit to a drive in unit to keep my valuables in. John has been great and very helpful. Also Judy as well who is here a lot of the time as well. Cheers!< /Text>

I have had a large storage unit for almost 8 years with this Public Storage on Santa Rita St  in Pleasanton, Ca.  I have never had anything but courteous service and staff is efficient in keeping the grounds and restroom facilities clean and available.  I would definitely encourage using their facilities as I am a happy client!<//Review>

The reason I give this particular location 4 stars is because online it states you can bring your own lock, and they will refund you the 19.99 they charge for use of their lock. However, the way this particular location has updated their doors, they require you to pay the 19.99 for use of their lock. I can't speak for other locations as this is the only one I have been to, but they need to either update the website so that it is not misleading/dishonest to people, or change their policy to match the rest of the company.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Positive-   It's a great location and the customer service that the entire staff provided was outstanding. From the time of check-in Judy gave me a tour of the unit and was extremely efficient.

Negative- My only negative comment is that due to the configuration of the property you have to basically park in the driveway and get out of your vehicle to punch in the gate security code.  And you also have to exit your vehicle to enter the gate code as you leave. Probably not much could be done about entry due to space but it would be nice to punch in the gate code from your vehicle as you're leaving.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

I've recently vacated 10x15 storage unit at this facility after storing for 2 months in a row. I can proudly say that I felt this place as my second home all because of Judy. She is the sole reason for me to select this facility. She always had the smile, very professional, helpful and friendly, explained everything in detail even without asking. She also toured me to couple of units and helped me decide the right size unit. The facility is always clean and secured. Accessing the facility and the unit in the car/truck is much ease. I will strongly recommend this place to my friends. Again Thanks Judy for all the help.< /text>

<Text>Words cannot express how satisfied I am with my visit earlier today thanks to Janine. My sister and I were cleaning out my dads unit and we were having a really difficult time doing so but absolutely all of our questions and concerns were resolved upon stumbling across Janine when we caught her doing some maintenance on the doors. So many things were going wrong prior to that but she really made our visit extremely delightful. It was a very nice experience but I must highlight that I haven’t encountered such professionalism in a while. Thank
You so much Janine.<//Text></record>

This was my first time renting a storage unit, and I wanted to give a big thank you to Janine! She made my stressful situation easy and a positive experience. I appreciate not only the time she spent answering all of my questions about the process/contract, but also giving me helpful tips for storing my items.
Thank you!</Text>

After looking for a storage facility for my new motorcycle, I was finally put in contact with Judy and very pleased to find out she had the perfect unit. Her experience with this situation was invaluable. I've been here for two months and I feel that my property is in the best hands possible. And Judy's trainee, John, confirmed my thoughts on Judy's demeanor, (professional, honest and gracious).< /Text>

I’ve had my things at this Public Storage facility for over two years, and I dont worry about it at all. Safe and secure location, and well-maintained. I passed by recently and Debbie & John were very helpful. Although the price has increased over my two years renting storage space here, I would highly recommend it, as you get what you pay for.<//Text>

Judy was super helpful from the beginning of my lease up until my last day here. I never had any issues and the facility was consistently kept clean.
Definitely consider Public Storage on Santa Rita if you’re looking for storage!< /Text>

Recently cleared out my unit, just didn't need it anymore. Because of traffic, I didn't have much time before John left for the night. John was more than helpful, and even had to stay a few minutes late to let me get out with all my stuff, including my motorcycle. He even gave me a ride from the office to my unit. Friendly and excellent service!</review>

<Text>Today I signed up to rent a storage unit with Judy, the manager. She did a great job showing me the storage unit and guiding me through the paperwork. She outlined what I needed to know and explained some of the useful storage-related materials that were available for purchase on-site. I've used this same facility in the past and have had nothing but good experiences.</Text>< Pics>

Mike was a wonder to work with. This was my mother's first time buying a storage room and we weren't too sure of what we were looking for. Mike made the whole experience very pleasant, explaining each of our options clearly and giving friendly customer service. My mother was happy with her room and the prices she was quoted which made the decision an easy one! I will definitely be recommending Public Storage to my friends and family.<//Text>

My husband and I are consolidating a couple storages we have and we found just what we needed at the Public Storage on Santa Rita Rd in Pleasanton, CA. I reserved the unit online and we received a courtesy call the same day to setup a time to go in and complete the move-in process. The office manager was super friendly and answered all of our questions and made us feel very comfortable about choosing this location. We could tell she takes her duties as property manager seriously and wants to ensure all her renters feel good about keeping their valuables onsite. If you’re looking for a local place to store your belongings head over to Public Storage on Santa Rita. You won’t be disappointed 😁</Text>

Went in to look at units as my In laws will be moving here in a few months. Was not sure about the size of the units. Judy showed us around the property and explained all the ins and outs of storing. They also have all the packing supplies that you will need to start getting ready.  Thank you Judy for being so patient with us and answering all our questions.< /Text>

< Review>
I'm delighted with my experience at this Public Storage facility.  Shane was friendly, professional, and easy to work with.  He helped me get set up with the right unit for me.  I loved being able to drive right up to the unit (with other facilities I considered, I would have had to deal with elevators or stairs). Over the 7 months that I had my stuff stored there between moves, every time I came by and interacted with Shane or other team members, they were delightful and helpful, going above and beyond whenever possible.  And when it came time to leave because I had completed my move to the South Bay, Shane was just as friendly as that first day and helped me get checked out smoothly.  Thank you!< /Review>

<text>I bought some boxes and was given old-fashioned carry-the-boxes to your car, and a hand shake service. The guy helping us was pretty in the know about the stuff he had to offer. I had never heard of stretch wrap before my visit, or how easy it is compared to tape. This location, I give it 5 stars for the good service and I also wanted to compliment the person who found the staff because the new gal who had rang us up while the guy carried the boxes to our car was also very helpful. Cheers.</text>< Pictures>

From the moment we walked into her small office, Melody has been extremely supportive. She helped us to reserve the storage unit we wanted, followed up on the phone and answered all the questions we had. The place is clean, easy to access, looks safe and orderly. We highly recommend it for anyone to use.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Melody is a great manager and leader.  She is very professional, has excellent people skills, and she definitely has a heart to help the customer.  She is always very friendly and accommodating, and she does whatever she can to meet client needs.  She makes sure you have the right sized space, with not too much or too little, and she works to keep the price down.  The rest of the staff we had contact with also demonstrated the same care and concern for meeting customer needs in a timely way.  That's why we came back again, and we count it a privilege to give this review.  Keep up the good work. You're a super team.

The Best Always,

Jim<//Text>< date>

< Review>
I went to this Public Storage to help a friend move out of his storage today and couldn"t believe the chick working, it's my old storage lady Janine. She used to work at Lock it up off Stoneridge. I haven"t seen her in forever.she's hella cool and my girl and her used to act like they was Bff's that's what a cool storage lady she is. I'm glad she found a better place to work and yall so lucky to have her really. This storage place is pretty nice too, all ground floor and my buddy says he liked it here. I will definately come here next time we need a storage if Janine is still here even better. You rock< /Review>

I have had nothing but outstanding service from Melody! I have traveled up and down the west coast and have always used Public Storage but have not received better service than what I have experienced at the location off Santa Rita. Melody has been very nice, helpful, and always quick to return my calls or following up to see how my experience is going. Public Storage is lucky to have a hard working individual that represents the company so well and is a valuable asset. Thank you Melody!<//text>

<Time>1406253953096< /Time><rating>5< /rating><review>This is a GREAT self-storage facility!  I have rented self-storage facilities all over the Western United States, and this is about as good as it gets.  It is extremely rare to find a storage facility like this, where they get everything right.

The location is convenient,about a mile off the 580 freeway; and the facility is enormous so there are a range of different sized units (most all, are drive-up), and there are no bugs/critters.

Most importantly, Melody and Mark are the consummate professionals.  They run a tight ship but they are also very polite and a pleasure to work with.

Here's the review Shane asked from my husband yesterday... only today it is a much worse outlook for you guys today after my phone call with Shane!

So the stay with public storage was fine... actually had a great experience setting up the unit... no issues throughout minus the huge jump of $49 per month a couple months back (we were not on a promotion, so we were baffled by the huge price difference). That was fine, we paid it... my husband and I got a rental home and closed out our unit on 12/7, after making a payment on the 1st like we were supposed to... little did we know, we would not receive a refund for the remainder of the month! Seriously?!? So you can rent out the unit to another customer and take all of my money even though we have removed everything?!?

Sounds like double dipping public storage... thanks for making us aware of places we will never use again or recommend to ANYONE.

So sorry that we pay our bills on time and now we are being penalized for it! This is such bs that you take my money (+insurance) for an entire month, only to possibly rent to a new customer that same month and make more money!

This is only one of many reviews that I will be making today. Thank you for showing us how greedy of a company you are!< /text>

<text>I rented storage units from this location more than two years.  The move-in process was all made very simple, but the move-out was a bait and switch operation.  Was originally told I could move out at any time, per the month to month contract, and settle up a pro-rated amount once everything was removed from the unit.  On move-out, was informed this was a "courtesy" offered to renters in the past and now rescinded.  Pay up please!  What I call it is breach of a verbal contract.  Local manager (Shane) and district manager were nice, but offered no help.  Call to corporate was answered by a very rude and condescending individual who didn't take me seriously.  Public Storage has normalized this fraud and incorporates it into their business practice.  My advice, stay away!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>Just called Santa Rita Rd Public Storage, cause I'm gonna need storage soon and Melody answered, so glad shes still there. Last year when I called for info, she was so helpful! Just verified the price on the size I think I'm gonna need and will be heading in to do the rental next week or two, once I find out exact date of the move.

Thanks Melody for everything you do!

<username>Dusty Jean< /username><date>1395338195428<//date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I have been with Public Storage for several years and I have been very happy with the safety, security and peace of mind.  I needed to rebuild my home and my life and needed the space to do so.

When I went in (never having a storage unit before and not happy about the idea of it) I had first met with Melody and was very pleased at her knowledge of the property that she was caring for. I have even been so busy as to forget to lock my unit back correctly and within a VERY short time Melody contacted me. I know based on that they they do the rounds as claimed and they care for their customers.

This past week (now almost 2 years later) I decided that I needed to upgrade my unit and was lucky to meet Marc (covering for Melody so she could enjoy her day off) and he too was wonderful to work with. He was patient when I ran into a frustrating situation and was short on time. He ensured that I was getting what I needed and that in the future I knew that I would be met with a good customer service follow up.

Having to rebuild my home and life has been more than over whelming and the amazing staff at Public Storage on Santa Rita Rd. in Pleasanton have made my life so much easier.

Thank you!!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Cheryl in Dublin, CA who helped us immensely by sending us to another location in Pleasanton, CA  with a better deal and more available units. In Pleasanton, we were helped by Shane in a very friendly and professional way . He was alerted by Cheryl that we were on the way, new my name and proceeded to show us the available unit and clearly explained the fees and procedures.  Great job!</Text>< Pics>

So I guess I have to come move up here now. Public storage relocated the best manager ever. I rent in Palo Alto and Shane was the best part. I guess I'm moving haha. Every thing here is drive up so if I need in that neck of the woods o know where to go.</Review>

<review>Marc was very professional in signing me up and showing me my storage space.  However, I was charged $161 (rent [$109], insurance, lock, etc.) rather than the $1 advertised, for the first month's rent -- rather disappointing.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><Time>1409790736825< /Time><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x808fe9138cd50447:0xc8a2531f3b67cf51<//gmapID><user>116657858812620841055<//user>< Rate>

My brother Kirk moved to southern california a year ago after 20 years in the Bay Area, he had a ton of stuff to store and only a week to get it all into storage, Melody, who runs the Public Storage on Santa Rita Road in Pleasanton even remembered that somewhat rushed move after him being gone a year, and this time was no different, we had about 6 days to get it all repacked and cleaned out by May 1st.   Melody could not of been more helpful and smart about what she does...she focused us on a plan to empty one side of two units so we could downsize efficiently as well as isolate a selective portion of Kirks belonging to be picked up and trucked to Fullerton...she told us everything we needed to make that possible, quickly and most ecomical way to arrange it.  thanks to her what seemed like an impossible endeavor was accomplished in record time and she guided us so that it was the cheapest way too.   That gal is gold to the storage business..she knows her stuff and how to really help you with yours!!!   five stars,...she deserves ten.  Thankyou so much for all you did to help us do it quick and save us money doing it your way as well.  Julie (Kirks sister you told us just how to do it, we did it and couldn't be happier with public storage at 2500 Santa Rita Rd,  but most of all with you!  You were great!   We love you!!!  Kirk and Julie Patterson.</Text>

Humberto and team did an amazing job on my Civic! The entire process was incredibly easy and painless. I used the online appointment system and did not experience any issues, the online discount was a nice bonus! Humberto was friendly and a great communicator, I was able to text him and received responses surprisingly fast! I will absolutely be going back to Genesis Window Tint if we need to tint another car.<//review>

Umberto is the best! I had my car windows tinted in order to cut down on the desert heat, and he did a fantastic job! My car is a small hardtop convertible, and it’s not easy to get to the back and side windows, but he worked some magic, and got all the windows beautifully covered! The tint job is perfect!<//Review>

I called Genesis Window tinting first thing this morning when they opened. They scheduled me for the next morning which was awesome but I was hoping for same day service since I have an extremely busy week this week & today would be much more convenient for me.
They were able to accommodate my schedule which I’m sure probably wasn’t really to convenient for them.
They did an outstanding job at a very fair price! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to get they’re vehicle tinted as my wife & I are very happy with the job they did on my wife’s vehicle!< /text>

Umberto provided professional, personal service. The quality of the work was remarkable and he completed ahead of schedule.
My SL550 was expensive and I was apprehensive about the outcome.
I am very pleased. Anyone thinking of handing over their car to Umberto can rest assured he will take good care!< /Text>

His online appointment system with the added benefit of a favorable discount made the whole process pretty seamless.

< Review>
100% positive experience.  I had absolutely zero clue as far as window tinting went before I moved from the East coast but here in the desert it's way too hot to not tint your windows.  I looked up some basic info but Humberto did a great job on explaining the options, pricing and giving me some demos.  He helped me choose the right tint for me and didn't push anything on me.  They offer a great discount and after checking out a couple other local places, the price was right here plus they were very professional and kind.  They made me feel comfortable and confident in the choice.  The job was done in a couple hours and looks great.  I finally don't feel like I am sitting in a tanning bed while driving my car.<//Review>

<review>Awesome job, quick and professional service. Excellent value. Humberto and his team are pros and know what they’re doing. Window tint is a necessity in the desert. I’ve had many vehicles tinted and my recommendation is to always get the CERAMIC tint. It’s much more heat resistant and will save your interior and help your AC work better—you’ll notice it immediately.
Thanks Genesis!< /review>< time>

Great service! Great explanation of product and expectation. Walked in for estimate and received an appointment for the next day. Very clean and well managed shop. The truck was fully protected during the tint install, then washed and ready in < 4 hours, as promised. Straight forward pricing and just the right options. Thank you, Humberto!</Text>

Umberto provided professional, personal service. The quality of the work was remarkable and he completed ahead of schedule.
My SL550 was expensive and I was apprehensive about the outcome.
I am very pleased. Anyone thinking of handing over their car to Umberto can rest assured he will take good care!< /review>

<Review>100% positive experience.  I had absolutely zero clue as far as window tinting went before I moved from the East coast but here in the desert it's way too hot to not tint your windows.  I looked up some basic info but Humberto did a great job on explaining the options, pricing and giving me some demos.  He helped me choose the right tint for me and didn't push anything on me.  They offer a great discount and after checking out a couple other local places, the price was right here plus they were very professional and kind.  They made me feel comfortable and confident in the choice.  The job was done in a couple hours and looks great.  I finally don't feel like I am sitting in a tanning bed while driving my car.<//Review></record>

I cannot express  how pleased I am with how great my car n looks and feels great!. I went ahead and chose to do the 3M Ceramic film because of the the heat protection being that its so hot here in the desert 🏜  😩....I also had the windshield done with the clear it was definitely worth it❄ 👌 😌. As I noticed a huge difference when I got into my vehicle this in 120°  weather!! My car looks and feels Great 👍<//Review>

<text>I don not usually write reviews, but felt i had to here. Humberto and Genesis are the consummate professionals and the work they do is excellent. Humberto was great communicating, advising and the care they took was outstanding! If you are looking to get your car tinted or tint repaired, I highly suggest using Genesis. Humberto and Genesis get a 10 out of 10 in my book and should in yours as well! Thank you again Humberto!<//text><username>Dennis Coker< /username></record></dataset><record>

I got the ceramic tint on all windows including windshield on my Silverado 2500hd Crew Cab. Truck looks great, and he was done on time, plus it included a carwash with interior vacuum.
Coupled with their guarantee/warrantee, I wouldn't suggest any other place.
The owner is friendly and walked me and my wife through all our options during the quote, never pushing anything on us. I'm taking our daughters car in to be done in a couple days!<//review>

<text>I needed my windows tinted quickly as my schedule is very tight. I called these guys over here at Genesis Window Tint & was told to come in an hour later. These guys got all 5 of my windows done in an hour. The quality of their work is also fantastic. My car looks 100x better with window tint now. Also much cooler in the hot desert sun! Would highly recommend these guys. Quality, professional work with a lifetime warranty on the tint for an excellent price.< /text><Time>1595882022415</Time>< name>

Got my vehicle in the same day. I was shown the different kinds of tint, how they would look on my vehicle and how the tint would feel in the sun using a heat lamp. The tint looks flawless. Overall great experience, I couldn’t be happier. I’m having my girlfriend take her car in soon. Thanks guys!!</text>

Had a great experience with Humberto! The facility was clean, he was fast, took his time to explain different tints to me and most importantly, his work is great! He ended up doing two of my cars in one day because his service is exceptional! Will be going back in the future.< /Review>

Genesis Window Tint did such a great job on the tint for my first car that I decided to do my classic car with them too. The second time I did encounter problems with bubbles on the tint of 2 windows (due to it being a much older car), Genesis quickly addressed the issue and now my car looks great! Thank you so much for the professional work and great service. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get their windows tinted.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><Pics>None<//Pics><Review>Humberto is the best! Explained the options and demonstrated UV protection with a simple lamp box and samples of tinted glass and the differences between them was amazing in regards to heat transfer.

I never knew they had a clear film for your windshield that cuts out 50% of UV rays and Even though it is not “legal” as it is clear I doubt that a officer of the law would notice it. I’ll be back for that when I have more time.

Thanks Humberto!< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1593223731366, 'text': 'Thank you so much Mr Marty ! We ll see you soon ! Thank you for coming over Sr !'}<//Resp><Date>1593222877013< /Date><user_id>108591765861663609056</user_id>< GmapID>

Best bang for your buck for quality window tinting. Choose the ceramic tint, as it is the ideal tint here in the Desert, esp in the approaching Summer weather.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOckKPnvq3YiH-3ZUpFPsKQHtvJtOxf2RQU4iqL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWx5Su9YxrO63OCWmmpQwBWfr4iSSubxkmxXyJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< username>

Genesis is the best! We've done 3 cars so far and are now sending everybody we know. High quality, professional service! The car is so much cooler now with the ceramic tint. Humberto and his crew are the best. If your looking for window tint look no further.< /Text>

Great service and comparable prices. I showed up with no appointment and they were able to squeeze me in the same day. Humberto was very patient describing the different types of tint and had a heat box sample to personally feel the difference between tint % and types. I even got a complimentary car wash at the end.< /text>

Humberto is extremely knowledgeable can answer any and all questions you may have, trust me I am very very picky and to be honest as a picky person they're more picky than me with there attention to detail. If ANYONE and I mean anyone is looking for superior quality tint in the valley they need to visit Genesis Window Tint and leave with a big smile on your face !!!

Superior quality, proper price point and total professionalism. 👍<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dafd0c1d70f959:0x70cf656df7919089</gmap_id><time>1596675100024<//time></record></dataset><record>

They were on time and pretty much gave an EXACT time to when my car would be ready. They are very friendly as well. Not pushy in any way as other business sometimes are.

Ok let me tell you that getting your windows tinting in an area where the sun can blaze at over 130 degrees it is important to have someone that knows their business. Humberto is a top notch guy with an understanding of what is needed for you to be comfortable in your automobile during hots hot days. There is no one that provides a personable friendly service like the guys at Genesis Window Tint. Not only am I super happy with my decisions to get my windows done here but I am going to be the biggest advocate for his brand. Do yourself a favor if you need your home, auto, or office windows tinted the choice is simple, Genesis Window Tint is the place and only place to get your tint done.<//text>

Waited three years to get my windows tinted only wished I did it sooner. Genesis window tint has many options to choose from at different price points. I got the ceramic and was able to drive home with no ac on in the desert summer. Would recommend genesis to everyone.</review>

Humberto was very professional and finished my truck in less time than he had quoted. He did a fantastic job on the window tint and I would recommend him to anyone looking to have this done. Humberto showed me the benefit to upgrading to the ceramic tint and it was a no-brainer. If you’re looking to get your widows tinted, look no further! And a free car wash too!!<//Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>When I called Genesis window tint, I spoke with Humberto. Humberto was very professional and helpful. He gave me a quote price and was available to tint my truck, that day. I took my truck and they greeted me very respectfully. Showed me the samples of tints and and prices. I got the best service and deal. He was done with my truck in good time. Later that day Humberto send me a message, thanking me for choosing them. He also send me pictures of my truck , now and then. I thank them for their service. I am very satisfied with the service and my truck looks amazing.  Thank you Humberto. Awesome job. I will definitely recommend you guys to others.< /review>< pictures>

I had my tint done on my Toyota Camry 2014 this weekend and I have to say, the drive from Anaheim to Palm Springs was worth it!!! It was amazing service from the beginning and I felt comfortable with leaving my car in good hands!! After the tint was done, I was amazed with the quality of it!! I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a spot to have their cars tinted, to come here to get the service, you will not regret it! So so happy with my results!!</text>

Thank you, Humberto, and the team from Genesis Window Tint for your 5 Star ⭐️ Window Tinting Service.

I’m now ready for the summer heat and protected from UV light with the ceramic tint!

My Lincoln MKZ Hybrid looks great! Thank you for the FREE car wash too at Harv’s Palm Desert.

If you are looking to tint your windows, I highly recommend that book an appointment online and save with their summer special!</Review>< pictures>

Great job, the brothers tinted my windows 9 days ago. Everything was superb. Car is still hot when sitting in the sun, but it's a HUGE difference, and AC cools off so much faster. I spent about $400, but it's all ceramic all the way around. The two of them finished and car was washed in under two hours. I have a minor gripe about what appears to be some scratches on the lower part of the windshield tinting (clear ceramic on windshield) but I also have yet to attempt to wipe it down. Even if it isnt something that wipes off, it's not too noticeable. I would recommend, and I'll be back for a lighter tint on the front windows when I eventually get a fix-it ticket, lol.
Warning: "medium" appears to be almost as dark as the "dark" when its said and done, so if you're worried about getting pulled over, go with "light" on front windows.< /text>

Genesis Window tinting did a very nice job on my tininting of my new car. They got me in very quickly and were done when they said they would. I definitely recommend them for tinting. Seems to be very good quality tinting.<//Review>

Prompt professionals. Wonderful greetings upon arrival. The temperature  is currently  102 and I'm in outdoor seating and yet it's very comfortable. I strongly  reccomend  conducting business with Harv's Window Tint.< /Text>

<review>So pumped to be out the house. What better restaurant to eat than Rock & Brews. The atmosphere and music is always on point. Of course, the servers are very friendly. I always get the garlic fries. For a brief moment we felt normal. Thanks Rock & Brew crew! Highly recommended! ✊🏾👍🏾💯<//review><resp>None</resp><user_id>106123613232828118426< /user_id><pics>None< /pics><Name>Dwayne Sanders</Name>< Rating>

Love this place. It was pretty packed and was told the wait would be about 45. Surprisingly we were brought to our table in less than 20 minutes. Great food. Great service. Good drinks.</Text>

Ordering Take out from there is a hassle. Do you have to get your temperature checked go all the way through the whole entire restaurant, and wait by the bar. This could be done much more efficiently<//Review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>Rock and Brews is a great place in downtown El Segundo, CA.

It has a real open airy feel to it with their high peaked roof and wide open outdoor courtyard. They definitely have taken advantage of the Southern California Coastal climate with the design of the place.

Rock and Brews has a bunch of craft beers on tap. I mean, a bunch! A well represented variety of styles and brewers.

Their menu looked to be fairly typical. But they did have some surprises, for sure. They offered breakfast which I didn’t expect. Also had an interesting selection of “Artisan Burgers”.

Good service was offered even though the place was very busy.

If you have an appetite-or help-go for the steak nachos. They were tasty and plentiful!

Rock and Brews in El Segundo is a solid choice for an individual, group, or family.< /text>< pics>

My team celebrated my retirement after 36 years @Rock&Brew - El Segundo. Immediately seated a 9 person party at bench like table. All in the quasi outdoor patio seating common in R&Bs everywhere. Immediately the server was there for drink service( beer & wine only). Very nice selection of local and non local beer. Nice variety. Food menu scaled down but still a good variety. Appetizers were on point esp the egg rolls asian wings. I  had trip tip sandwich. A little too thick cuts of meat for a sandwich, stll good. The sweet potato fries were quite good and perfectly cooked. Everyone got served at the same time and food was hot! Very crowded but every table group separated by partitions. Great setting with rock roll posters and old rock videos & music.< /Review>

Nice and open place to have lunch in the area on a sunny day. There are lots of beer on tap.  The baby back ribs are amazingly good. Plays good classic rock.< /review>

Music videos and band flags surround the very roomy dine-in area. The tables are spread out and divided by plexiglass to keep safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is plenty of variety on the food and beer menu so everyone will find something they like. The servers are friendly and helpful with great suggestions.
If you like rock music and burgers, wings, pizza, and beer, this place is right for you.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It looks like a big red barn from a distance but upon further review, it’s a great open air concept. Big TVs for the games. I had some of the best fish and chips I’ve never had in my life at this place and my waitress suggested vinegar with it, which took my taste buds to the promised land! Came from Arizona and glad we found this place. Will be back Fosho!!!< /review>

I like coming to this outdoor bar in El Segundo. They usually have a good selection of beers on draught. The food is pretty decent - not my favorite place to eat, but good if you're there for the beer and the outdoor space. I appreciated the enormous pretzel with bier cheese. This place is also alright in the cold months because they have space heaters throughout the bar.</text>

Went for the Dodger game. First time since they re-opened. New staff is not as good as before. Every time they brought us a round of drinks at least one of us did not get what we requested. Should not be that difficult. There were only 3 of us. Food quality is also not as good as before.<//text>

<Text>This place is always clean, the staff always friendly (even when they're on break). Consistent with their Redondo Beach location too. I like their setup and ambience. Also they are pet friendly in their outside area with dog options. The food is pretty basic restaurant bar options but they are above average on quality and portions. They sometimes have some options that stand out like the Nashville wings I posted. Best dry run wings I've tasted. Also their beer selection is the best out there for chains.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNryxUjZdu0HcGrrZLWMerkB9SOBbr1A8bHU9XL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c2b141feea7911:0xdfcde038ad06b6a0< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Rock and brews, rcok and brews, cork and brews, oh how I love that name. How many times have I been there with Beatrice (the wife) kids and grandkids?! I cannot tell you. Oh, is it not such a fun and lively enrvironment for the young ones these days to listen to some real music for change instead of there “dojo cats” and “karly bs” singing in a monotone voice about they’re “witches and pickles”. Speaking of pickles this reminds me of when Jason (son) picked up a beer for a contest. Jasom took they stine of bear and held it till his eyes popped out and blood came out of his axillary artery (I’m sorry I had to share that Jadon, but I din’t know what else to put]. Apart from the pickle of a beer holding contest, I cannot for the Live of me describe theri food. There may have been a chicken??? I’m sorry for taking so much of your time to tell the tales of times before, but I hope you feel the need to cheque my other reviews of this beautiful town EL SEGUNDO. My best to all,

<GmapID>0x80c2b141feea7911:0xdfcde038ad06b6a0< /GmapID><text>What's not to like??? Great music, awesome food, and killer beers on tap. The staff have always been extremely helpful when I come here. Parking can be tricky at times since it's a main street location but they do offer parking in the back side of the restaurant. Prices are fair, usual for this type of place.

Beer - take your pick and give something new a try. I can't vouch for the cocktails but I'm sure they're good. They have a full bar here so might try it next time. I personally prefer the beers on tap. Having so many I like to try something different each time I come here. I recommend you doing a flight if you want to try anything particular.

Food - Great selection during lunch times for a quick bite. I like the wings and burgers here best. However the Pizza's are pretty solid as well. I recently ordered the devil chicken sandwich and man it was AMAZING! Just the heat you need served with friends. I just enjoy coming here with friends and family and enjoying good times. I will be back soon, keep the tunes, beer, and food flowing.<//text><user>113183529148414761215<//user>< Pictures>

Fun casual atmosphere in an outdoor setting. They serve up some great wings and appetizers and the fish tacos are great.  Nice selection of local craft beers including from El Segundo Brewing Company, which is just across the street.

Update: we decided to visit Rock & Brews again two days later after having a great experience the first time. I am sorry to say, that our second visit has caused me to lower my rating of Rock & Brews from 5 stars to 3 stars.  The food was still good, but the server, Rachel, did not return to to table to check on us after taking our orders.  According to the receipt, I was served an Expatriate IPA beer when I ordered a Space Dust IPA. We wanted to order more drinks and tried to catch her eye as she served adjacent tables. We ended up finishing our meals and paying without ordering anything else.</Text>

I went there for lunch. Had the Hawaiian Kobe steak and it was tasty but chewy! Let's just say US Kobe is NOT Japanese Kobe. The stuffed jalapenos were delicious and large (both the chilli size and portion size).  It was a bit muted and lunch, and I would imagine that dinner could be fun with music and drinks.  My friend had fish and chips which were also tasty and big. Next time I will try hot wings and skip the US Kobe.</review>

Food was good, customer service was good and the location was great!

I ordered wings for an appetizer which were delicious. I’ve never been a wing fan but these were yummy. I ordered one of their sandwiches and it was delicious.

I recommend going to try all of the brews. The fries were my favorite part of the meal.<//Text>

OK, think California.  Now think 60's/70's and Rock and Roll - and add in beach cities.  This place nails it!   Laid back, casual, warm, full of rock memorabilia and great rock music playing.

Long varnished wooden tables inside and out, the place must seat 250 comfortably.  A couple came in with 2 dogs and sat on the patio.  First move by the waiter - a bowl of water for each.  Nice!

Large selection of beers on tap and the food was just right.  High quality ingredients, prepared perfectly.  I had blackened sea bass tacos.  Fish crispy outside, juicy inside; topped with avocado, slaw and pickled onion slices.  Lime wedges, a ramekin of pico de gallo and a small bowl of killer black beans round out the plate.  This place checks all the boxes.< /review>

Yesterday was the first time in this good restaurant. But It is absolutely not the last. We had a good time with the good service, with the finest cooking and wine and with the comfortable payment. We will no doubt come back again.<//review>

<Text>This place Rock and Rolls literally. It's great for families, kids, groups, dates, and single people. It has a bit of a Hard Rock influence. It has posters, memorabilia, artwork, loud amazing music playing, delicious food, and tasty drinks. I had a bloody Mary that was spot on. The food is served in large portions so you can share if you prefer and highly recommended. It's in a great location and at this specific day the car show was happening. So it was a perfect day. Rock and Roll music,family, food, drinks, and cool cars. Go check it out if your in El Segundo. Highly recommended good times! 🤘🚘🎶🔊👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🎹🎤🚘🤘<//Text><name>Jeanette Rodriguez<//name><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

I'm not a big music fan, went there for a work lunch. The menu is awesome though and my food was great. I ordered the ham and cheese melt and it was exactly what I was hoping for, a grilled cheese sandwich with a piece of ham within. It was on toasted cheese bread, yum. Every other dish that my party ordered looked delicious and was told the same by the person. Will definitely be back.< /text>

<Review>It's one of the best places to go to for lunch. Food is great, if not perfect. I have tried a few items on their menu and I hhave liked them all. Only nitpick is that you gotta get there early for lunch as it gets filled pretty quick and there's very minimal parking.< /Review>< time>

<Text>This place is a tribute to the best bands in any rock format. Especially the Beatles. They're opening a new location in orange county rather soon and I can't wait. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and  efficient. I love the open area makes it feel like a very welcoming. A recommend for anyone getting to know La.< /Text>< rating>

The atmosphere is the best part. It's a nice open air restaurant with pretty decent food. Staff was super nice and the service was pretty quick even with a big group. If you are military, this is the place to go. A lot of the Airman from LAAFB go here, especially for promotion parties and farewells. There could have been more outdoor umbrellas for the sunnier times of days in my opinion, but overall a good experience.<//Text>

<Text>I've been here a few times. The food is actually much better than I expected. It just seemed like I was going to get typical bar food but it is actually flavorful and cooked well. I love the fact that they play music videos. It is very nostalgic. The rock n roll decorations are also very cool.<//Text>< pics>

<review>We were visiting LA from the eastern half of the country and needed a good ol American food place to eat due to a non adventurous eater in the group. We stumbled across this place and gave it a try. The atmosphere was very cool with all the rock and roll stuff. The food was good also though we thought it a bit pricey for hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza and the standard American faves. I would suggest eating here if you're visiting from out of town. If you live in the area I would also suggest it. I liked it enough to by a t-shirt so I guess that sums it up.</review><response>None<//response><username>Jared Rogers< /username><rate>4</rate><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I work nearby and this spot has been our go to for going away parties for co-workers. Service has been great overall and they do take separate tabs. Parking can be tough right next to it but there should be plenty within a block radius. There is no mixed drinks if you're new to Rock and Brews. Do note to call ahead for reservations for group of 10 or more as they can packed even on a weekday!</text>

Tacos were so good! The bartender was so nice and attentive ! They have an amazing selection of brews. Very accommodating if you want to change your meal around. Food came out at a reasonable pace. Atmosphere is modern and relaxed. Bouncer was very friendly and welcoming as well as GREAT with handling drunk people (Someone had a little to much to drink and the bouncer was an absolute gem in handling it- no scene whatsoever) prices are reasonable for El Segundo. I can’t get over how friendly the staff was and great the service was ! (bartenders name was Kyle)</review>

Parking is hard to find. Garlic fries were delicious! Because it is outdoors people smoking outside drifts in which is quite unpleasant. Would prefer it if it were fully enclosed.</Text>

Good food, great atmosphere. Open air seating with plenty of TVs to watch any sport you're interested in (NBA playoffs and NHL playoffs on the day I went --- enjoyed watching the Cavaliers get beat in game 5 against the Celtics).  Food tasted great and came out quick and hot. Beer selection was decent, I had the avery wheat beer which I would recommend. Service attentative; no complaints. Heated patio seating. Restrooms were clean, but I did have trouble getting the automatic hand towel thing to work. Certainly would come back to this location again. Several places in the vicinity looked good as well, but this place seemed to be the most lively.<//text>

Dog friendly and a great patio! The staff is very friendly and usually comes by to pet your dog. It is a great spot to go after work. They also have a decent wine selection and a pretty good food menu. I enjoy getting the pretzel as a starter.<//Text>

Once again we had an amazing time at Rock and Brews in El Segundo. My wife had the fish and chips, which were amazing - as I am still on a diet I had the Asian Chicken Salad - so so good.

Whatever we saw passing the table - it all looked so good!

Thanks also to Alexis, the wonderful host - and Caitlin who made sure we had an amazing time.

Would I go back? Absolutely, can't wait. Would I do a 30+ min detour just to go (mandatory with me to give stars). Of course I would. Highly recommended!</text>

<review>Good food, nice beer selection, cool location. I've been to other locations before, but this was easily the nicest and most interesting. 2/3s of the seating is outdoors, and it was night and a little brisk when we were there but they had plenty of heaters to keep it comfortable. As with all their locations lots of rock star pictures and logos abound, with music videos playing on multiple screens (with sound). My wife had a burger and salad, I had the fish and chips, along with beers off their rotating draft list. Everything was tasty and was worth recommending, prices were reasonable, and there was lots of parking in the area.< /review>< GmapID>

<Text>Fun, lively nighttime local hot spot to grab a bite to eat and listen to some great tunes. The Fish Tacos were excellent and a draft beer selection to die for. Food was quick and hot out of the kitchen and the atmosphere wasn't lacking visual stimulation. A bit on the loud side for someone wanting to relax but for a young or hip crowd, it won't disappoint.<//Text>< Pictures>

Good place with a great patio. Mostly good weather year round so you can almost always grab a table outside. Prices are a little inflated, but it is California. Food and staff are good.< /Text>

Great atmosphere. Especially around sundown. Catch the Dodger game or other sports event on the many TVs. Food is great and prices are as you'd expect. I Come here atleast once a month or so.</review>

The staff is courteous and fast. The atmosphere is very much rock and roll, but not over the top. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was made to perfection. I also had a side of sweet potato fries which were crispy and delicious. For desert I ordered there bread pudding and I'd say it's good. Probably not the best but really good. If you would like a drink and good food, stop by Rock & Brews.< /Text>

It's a good thing I wasn't driving because the various samples I had, and the final red I chose, were potent. I will be going back to try the food again and sample more brew.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The Rock & Brews restaurant in El Segundo is fantastic. They play rock n roll music. You have covered eating area and a non covered eating area. If you need an umbrella for shade they have them. The staff is hard working and the General Manager or a manager is always walking around making sure everything is good. The menu is the best. They have a shrimp salad that I have a hard time breaking away from. The burgers are out of control delicious and big. The wings are incredible. The pizzas are great. I have been numerous times and never had a bad meal.  This is a must try!!!< /Review>

<Text>Food is above average, but you need to go there a few times to know what to order. Get the pretzel w/cheese dip app, pizzas made to order, and the draft brews. And you'll be fine! Almost forgot, the dessert with the round ball things and fudge dip is also good but very rich.
If you want more noise and a happening scene, go to the Redondo Beach location. However, if you wanna be able to hold a conversation with your friends, then try the El Segundo location instead.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Laid back, casual, great food and pet friendly.
I brought my friends visiting from Brisbane, Australia.
I had a bowl of New England Clam Chowder... DELICIOUS. Then I had a Caesar Salad with grilled chicken... Excellent!
I brought Chester, my year and a half old Husky puppy. Chester sat underneath our table and ACTUALLY BEHAVED HIMSELF! Our waiter brought Chester a bowl of water. He drank the water and ATE THE BOWL!😨
Yes, you read that correctly.
My Australian guests thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Rock 'n Brews.</review>< gmap_id>

Good service and prompt. Not much of a wait time for the order. They have good music (not only Rock). Love their Asian zing wings and Blackened Fresh Salmon.  Been here in all seasons and they accommodate accordingly. They have open space with umbrellas for summer. Indoor place with heaters in winter. Placed in downtown El Segundo might be a little struggle to find parking space but it's free on the streets. Good place for team lunches or hanging out with friends.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Went for a drink to pick up a pizza to go. Great service, pretty basic and simple really. Cool dudes serving behind the bar. Friendly hostesses. A lot of GF options including some bottled beer. Mainly, great GF pizza!! Great music and was lively but not crazy on a Thursday evening about 5:30pm. I can imagine weekends are nuts though< /Review>

<text>The food is very good and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly and the service is fast.

The space is split into an indoor and outdoor portion. The outdoor space has picnic tables, umbrellas, and heat lamps. Family friendly. Dog friendly.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Open air beer garden type setup.   Food menu covers it all, and they have the most extensive beverage menu around.  TV's everywhere you look, so I'm sure it's great for sporting events. Food was good, beer was great, staff was awesome (Tara our waitress was fantastic)..... Overall great experience!<//review>

Food was delicous don't get me wrong, but they dont serve liqour only beer. Which is lame, because I dont drink beer I can drink Vodka though. Something about they dont have there liqour license yet. They dont have indoor room it's mostly outdoor so it does get a bit chilly.< /text>

This place was a blast! Open air seating, large bench tables, excellent drink and food selection, and well made food. Combine that with the ocean air and it is a great evening. I haven't had the chance to take my wife on a date in a while. My girl flew in for  another event and I picked this place for dinner and fun. I think I nailed it! Thanks  Rocks and Brews!< /text>

Closes early for what it is (10:30pm, kitchen well before that). It's a chain: If Applebee's and Hard Rock Cafe had offspring, it'd be Rock n Brews.< /review>

<text>The Tijuana salad left a little to be desired. It was mostly romaine with hardly any of the veggies listed in the menu
The kicker, however was the trip tip. It was in whole slices on top of the salad. Have you ever tried to cut a slice of steak on the top of a mound of romaine. Not an easy feat!</text>< user_name>

Great food, fun loud atmosphere, very kid friendly—they even got a kid play area! All seating is outdoors. Huge selection of beers, none have ever disappointed.

This is an outdoor beer garden with rock ‘n’ roll what’s not to love? They also serve Mrs. McCartney‘s Maharishi peach wine in their White Album sangria, a nod to the local 90-year-old winemaker  Dr Angie McCartney who lives in Playa Del Rey not far from this restaurant. I can recommend the barbecue ribs the sauce is outstanding, and once in a while you might find yourself in the middle of a Tesla or SpaceX party, and keep an eye out for Rockstars Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, co-owners who very occasionally pop in.<//Text>

Food was ok.  Service was so-so. Loved the atmosphere.  Being inside but still feeling like you are outside was great on a beautiful day.  Of course great music made that part perfect.  Ribs were not slow cooked.  The potatoes in the potato salad tasted as if they were not cooked completely. However, I will return to try other items on the menu (burgers, pizza & salads). Want to give this place a second chance!< /text>

If you're looking for great BBQ in the El Segundo area, this is it. The ribs were delicious, being just crispy enough to have a flavorful crunch, but moist enough that they melted in your mouth.

The burgers were pretty flavorful as well, if not a bit overcooked, but that could be more personal opinion.

The environment was perfect for the setting, playing some of my personal favorite classic rock hits, combined with several different types of beer on tap.

Overall, if you want a great place for that weekend vibe, and some pretty great BBQ, I would definitely recommend this place to you.</Text>

Pretty chill spot. They have an outdoor and indoor seating area. Seems like a place locals go. Bartender knew a lot of people. Very hipsterish. Pretty extensive beer selections on tap. Lots of TVs all around so you cam watch just about whatever game is on.  No sound though.</text>

<Review>Omg, the best burger of my life with a light cider. The servers are super sweet too! Will definitely be going again the next time in California. P.S. this is coming from a New Yorker and we are hard to please. #lit #quality</Review></record></dataset><record>

Would have given 5 stars but when I paid the bill the waitress came back and said to a table full people that my card didn't go through. I had plenty of money on it so I called the bank. They looked at the attempted charges and said the clerk put in the wrong 3 digit code. Come people how hard is it to get 3 numbers right.</Review>

Was a great time with company. The waiters were very responsive and food was good. Sports bar vibe with a bit better food than a sports bar.< /text>

My favorite restaurant. Simple. Love that they are dog friendly. Great food. If I had to pick a single restaurant to eat from for ever, it would be this place.</review>

Great looking menu. I came to try some local beer, but they were out of all the 3 I wanted to try.  Service was pretty slow for a Tuesday. The tritip taco's sounded better on the menu than they were for the price. I did enjoy the environment though.<//Text>

Great Bier Garten experience ! Friendly staff, great selection of food, great selection of Bier and staff did a great job pairing you to a beer you would like. It was a cool evening for LA so they had space heaters on making for a pleasant outdoor experience. As a vegetarian, they had plenty of choices. Parking was available on the premise. Made for a fantastic El Segundo experience !</Review>

Get the pretzel. Period.  Great beer selection as well.  It can be a little loud but it IS called "Rock & Brews"!  Great place to go for happy hour with friends.  I've also been to the location in Redondo Beach and had an enjoyable experience.<//Review>

Enjoyed the food (except for the sweet potato fries), environment was family friendly, and fun open environment. Although during our visit there were kids running between the seating area, and the play ground which was quite annoying. I would like to see the parents/ employees be more  responsible and keep the kids under control, a restaurant is not meant to be a place where you allow your kids to play cops and robbers...<//Review>

<Text>The beer selections are amazing. Tons of big screens for sports and music videos and a huge outdoor seating area with excellent heaters for colder days or nights. They also have a dog menu for your pet. My dog Bandit had the grilled chicken breast. They also have a hamburger patty and bacon!

Utterly generic for a chain beer and sports TV place. Food is a big part of why they're so generic, the beer selection is a good bit better...

And the outdoor/semi-outdoor feel mostly works, but it never feels all that unique to me. The character it tries to have might work in Columbus, Ohio, but here in El Segundo it just feels weird. Might have been hipster a decade ago, but today it doesn't do anything for me.</review>

<text>I had the LA street dog. It was hardly worth the $10 plus price, not even close to the price & flavor of a real bacon wrapped street dog. They only have beer & cider, no hard alcohol or cocktails. The beer we had came in a aluminium bottle, not on tap! Go to the R&B in Redondo, not as cold, and they have a full bar!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The menu is basic, but well prepared. Somehow Brussels sprouts replaced artichoke on the menu which was annoying, but that aside you are sure to find something you'd enjoy on the menu. Dog friendly, and a great place for those other little people some call kids. Great family restaurant, with great beer-should be busy on father's day.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Absolutely great, great beer selection and food was top quality. There aren't any rock bars similar to this one. The outdoors space is super convenient and carefully conditioned for any season.< /text>

Steak salad for lunch tasted great but an hour later, my insides said differently. Must have been the produce. Enjoyed the atmosphere, old music videos were a trip to see. Still able to hear my lunch companions. Their burgers and fish tacos looked amazing. Service was good for the late lunch hour. Will try eating here again to see if getting sick on the salad was a fluke.< /review>

Great local chain for after work happy hour. The food is good (try the Chicago Dog), and the beer selection is vast, including a good mix of local brews. The staff are knowledgeable, but not always super enthusiastic. There is both outdoor and indoor seating, and it is surprisingly kid friendly. They even have a small kids' play area. Parking can be tricky, but you can usually find a spot. If you are a rock fan, you will love it for the decor and the music. All in all, a very good joint and a local go-to.</text>

I'm not overly impressed with the food, this is my 4th time giving it a try before I knocked them for the food.  Also this location didn't serve liquor even though it was advertised in the menu (for over a year!).
I'd only hit this place up again to watch a game and drink beers, not date night with the lady.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Great beer selection and food. I had the pulled pork sandwich that was top notch.  Prices are fair, nothing great. Only negative was the service was bordering on "too good" as in they interrupted our dinner every 2 minutes to check if we needed anything.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Poor customer service here. I was elated to come yet now can't wait to leave. I came in with a group of friends and rather than split our checks up, she forced all of us to figure out how to split it up.

I had ZERO refills. None. I even saw a runner take a dish to a friend, my friend politely asked for a refill to which he responded that was the waitresses job.

Garbage. To think, two rock legends have their name associated with this poor service.

Good food though. The Portobello mushroom burger was exceptionally good.

Never coming back. Ever.< /review>

<review>I love this place. Really good food, good beer selection, great atmosphere. Of the three locations I have been to, El Segundo is easily my favorite! Great for one person  (always seats at the bar) or large group (large beer garten type tables). Kid and dog friendly (dogs welcome on the patio). Love the laid back beach city atmosphere. Wish I lived closer.< /review><user_id>104019415547654714623</user_id>< rating>

We love Rock & Brews.  I brought 46 people to our town, El Segundo for a tour of the sights.  We had lunch at the Rock & Brews.  I told them I was bring 22 people and we ended up with 46.  They took care of all of us with separate checks and the food was excellent.  The service was incredible.  Everyone loved going there and several have returned on their own.< /Text>

<review>Great open air concept with tables that accommodate large and small groups.  High quality gourmet burgers and bar food.  If you love pretzels then don't miss out on this pretzel and get it with the beer cheese<//review>< rating>

<Text>I first visited Rock & Brews for a work event. The atmosphere was so relaxed and friendly - perfect for hanging out with friends - that I returned the next day to grab dinner with another friend. The food was great, beer was cold, and service was friendly. Awesome place to chill, and perfect for a happy hour event!< /Text><name>Matthew Smith<//name>< Response>

This place is so awesome. The beer is awesome and the food is good. It's a family establishment which I forget sometimes but if you sit closer to the bar you'll forget children are playing on the side. Try the pretzel! It's awesome.< /text>

Great atmosphere, my girlfriend and I love bringing our dogs here. The fireball burger and Asian zing wings are my favorite things on the menu. Also, they make awesome garlic sweet potato fries. Also, good beer selection.<//Review>

It was easy to get a table here even on football Sunday. Our friend brought a dog so we grabbed a table outside. They also have a dog menu which we didn't order from but is a cute touch and they'll bring your dog a bowl of water upon request.

The Asian Zing Wings are outstanding, easily the best thing we ordered. The breading is perfectly fried and the sauce is a perfect combo of sweet and spicy. They are very filling. I ordered the Fireball Burger which was also good, I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was served on though and the salad was very boring. It was extremely filling.

The parking lot is small (especially on a Sunday with football) but we found street parking easily just across the street.< /Text>

<Text>Food is ok..

Great Veggie Burger. Fries were good and great atmosphere.
Parking is great. T

The Staff could be more friendly.

Ill share a little story about our visit. We were in a group of about 20 or so. Our Server gave us separate checks. My gf and another couple were the last ones to leave. The server made a big deal about one of the couples not paying. I thought this was bizarre so I said that I would pay for them. I paid and then texted my friend. My friend came back and showed us the receipt that they had already paid cash.

hmmmm.

Went there the other night and had a burger and some fries, a few beers, its Ok for a quick bite but yea. the service was a bit off<//Text>< Pics>

Visited a couple times on a recent trip. Great beer selections but didn't try the food. Bartenders helped point me towards a few very nice craft breweries in the area. Great outdoor area. Reminded me of a German beer hall a bit.<//Review>

The food was good.  I particularly liked the "strawberry fields" salad.  Our waitress was pushy and unpleasant before we ordered, and once we had our food we didn't see her until we had to find her to get our check.< /Review>

I had a couple of warm beers, fish and chips.  Everything was fine, about an hour later my stomach was on fire. I think the fish or the oil that they fried it in was bad. My stomach hurts so bad.</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Service was very poor. We were a party of 13. We requested separate checks. The server was very accommodating and assured us she would keep the tabs separate. Then the manager asked us to move to to a different table to accommodate a party with reservations. We obliged and moved our party to another table. At the new table we were informed we would have to close out our tabs since we were now in a different servers section. The bill came and it was not separated. I asked the manager to please separate the bill. He told me to go tell the server to separate the check. I requested the server to separate the bill several times. No response. So, I just paid the full bill because we were getting pressure from the new server to pay the check. The server at the second table never even asked if we wanted or order anything further. We were completely ignored. The irony, they conveniently added an 18% tip. We only had a few appetizers and some beverages. Yet we had to pay 18% for bad service. Not worth the bad treatment and mediocre food.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The original Rock and Brews. Open air feel with a good food and beer selection.  This location does not carry a hard liqueur license.< /Review>

Great place !  family friendly they have a great play area out on the patio for the kids. they also have inside tables with more of the rock and roll atomsphere. Everytime I come here I have excellent service from all angles of the restaurant  hostess, servers, bar, management, all so welcoming and accommodating. They have a wonderful beer and wine selection and they have yummy great quality food. They also have rock and brews merchandise t shirts, jackets, and shot glasses. Super rad spot if you haven't checked it out yet you should!<//review>

< Review>
The food was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I have the big soft pretzle to start with beer cheese. The pretzle was not to bad but I have had much better. I thought it was kind of crazy that they charge you $4 for beer cheese... that made the pretzle like $14!! I also had the fried chicken sandwhich. What I do like is that everything there is customizable, so I had my chicken sandwhich tossed in hot sauce, the sandwhich was delicious and the ranch that comes on it gives a nice cooling effect. The atmosphere was really cool, mostly outdoors and TV's everywhere to watch sports. Great place to watch a game! Overall good food and atmosphere, definitely recommend!<//Review>

check your bank statement after you pay here,  they like to add additional tips to the total after you leave without your consent,  then after calling and talking to the general manager they dismiss this as no big deal. I liked the place but afraid off there fraudulent act they did after leaving to go back.  Beware of them adding to the total after you sign the credit card receipt,  they added 30.00 to mine without my consent.< /Review>

I was second in line to a individual who was by himself. The hostess said she would be right back.. Once she seated the first patron the hostess came back towards the entrance and we made eye contact.. She spun around and ingored me.. Outside of that, Chris was a excellent server.. CSULB< /Review>

There can be a long wait when games are playing and the parking lot is small, but food and service was good. Also be aware that half of the seating is outdoors so it may be windy or cold while eating.< /review>

The original Rock & Brews is definitely the place to be in El Segundo! The place is basically a huge covered patio with plenty of heaters. Tons of TV's. The menu is huge so you will definitely find something you like.< /review>

Its busy on the weekends and most evenings.  The food is too greasy nothing special so I really don't understand why would all these people go there. Maybe for the beer!!. But guys really nothing special at all. I wish it was special so I would go there again.< /Text>

<Review>Great beer selection. Hard to find a place with such a great beer garden and perfect selection of bar bites. Yet it's a bit pricy and often gets taken over for private parties (tech companies, I'm looking at you). Go for a nice pour, stay for a small bite.<//Review></record>

<Review>By far the best thing about Rock & brews is the atmoshpere.  Great indoor / outdoor bar.  Large picnic tables.  Excellent for big groups.  Really cool rock music decor.  Little fenced in play area for the kids.  Very kid and dog friendly.  Food is ok, but nothing that is going to knock your socks off.  Great drink menu. Overall a good time.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great rock decor and great service. Food is tastey but a bit unhealthy in that it's buttered up and fried.< /review>

I'm not certain what others are seeing, but this place is far overrated. Been a few times to different ones and the experience has always been the same. Nothing special, and definitely nothing to write home about.<//text>

<text>The food and beverage selection is great. They have a full menu of food that goes beyond typical bar food with quality items for everybody weather you like salad, fish or have Ciliac. The Pizzas are great and apitisers are unique. Get the pretzels. They are shipped in from Munich.  They only have a beer and wine selection, no cocktails but the selection of beer is extensive. The cost can quickly add up so pay attention!  Dogs are welcome and kids have a place to play.<//text>< Pics>

Always busy, which is a good sign. Typical American fare with rock band banners all over the walls. Our server was very nice, and I'm sure quite busy, but she disappeared for too long between check ins. Good place to go for the first time, but it's busy and very loud and not worth going again.</review>

Nothing to do with R and B, BUT = Went to the Dodgers Game last night, and Gene Simmons sang the National Anthem.  It was fantastic.  He sounded great, along with his back up singers.

It was the only time during the national anthem at a sporting event that I did not want to jump out of the stands and strangle the dumb jerks that take two hours to get through a one minute song.

By the powers vested in me, I hereby decree that Gene Simmons shall be the only person to ever sing the National Anthem at any sporting event ever!!!<//text>

Dog friendly and kid friendly. Good food and local draught beers. Expensive. borderline not worth the high cost. Really great for the occasional outing with out of towners.</text>

I don't know if it was the fact that it was Sunday football or that they're regularly just very busy. Our service was slow and the food took a lifetime. I will say though that the staff were extremely friendly and once our issues were brought up to them our experience took a drastic turn for the better. The burgers were okay not too special, but the nachos were splendid.</Text>

Good (and occasionally adventurous) food, and the family-friendly atmosphere and activities for kids was a pleasant surprise. Festive DJ'd music at night can be loud, but lunch is a perfect time for a meet up for business casual  conversation.</Text>

Reasonable place for food and a drink. Poor breakfast / brunch options and it's only on Sundays from 10am - 2pm. Look elsewhere if you want a brunch.</Review>

For a bar and grill, it could definitely be a lot worse. I consistently find myself enjoying the food more that I think I would. I only wish they would expand their beer list a bit.</text>

<Review>Food was ok. A couple things should be more pronounced on the website; NO FULL BAR & CORRECT HOURS OF OPERATIONS. We arrived there at 8 and the staff started sweeping and cleaning up directly around us while we were eating. YOUR WEBSITE SAYS YOU CLOSE AT 10 ON SUNDAYS. Not our fault, shouldn't be made to feel guilty or rushed because of your error. Im sure this place is nice on a normal day but yea... this kinda sucked. Won't be back. Probably beacuse i don't know when you're actually open.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b141feea7911:0xdfcde038ad06b6a0</Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Can't say I was impressed, or even satisfied with this place...

I waited up front for a few minutes while the host carried on a conversation with a co-worker and was eventually seated by a waitress.  After browsing through the beer selection I came to find out they only had 1 out of 5 IPAs on their menu, of course they didn't have the one I wanted.  Ordered a burger (medium) and didn't taste anything but the bitterness of overly char-grilled meat.  Walked out dissatisfied and with about $30 less in my wallet...definitely not worth it!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Not sure if it still holds this title, but when it opened I was told this was the "largest year-round outdoor beer garden west of the Mississippi." Pretty specific, i know, but a fun place to enjoy with a group of friends/family.< /text>

Great selection of beers with a good athmosphere. Music isn't too loud so you can still hear your friends and there are large screens you can watch sport.</text>

Ive been coming here for a long time and ive had a great experience about 98% of the time. The food is great especially the asian wings and any of their pizzas. The manager is always around making sure everything is in tip top shape and the rest of the staff are friendly and professional. But this is Rock & Brews and both the brews here (Double Chocolate Stout) and the ambience is amazing. Its so in your face rock & roll with music videos on 24/7 of fun and lively music that keeps the crowd buzzing. Overall if youve never been you should definitely give it a try, its one of my favourite places to eat.</Text>

Good burgers and fries,  but somewhat expensive. Location is good in El Segundo. Service was good, not great. There's a nice outdoor seating area too.</review>

Honestly, I really enjoyed this place - but the signage for “Rock & Brew” is so cheesy. Why not change the name to something local - but keep everything else the same??? Asking for a friend.<//Review>

< Review>
Greatest wings in the Southbay. I have been trying to find a place other than Patrick Malloys that has great buffalo wings. Rock and Brews undoubtedly has the best wings. They have two different kinds which is great. They have an original buffalo style and a Chinese style wing that is amazing. The tough decision is which one to get so I always like to go in a group so we can order both. Their pizza (maui Wowie) is extremely good there too. It was my favorite pizza place until Grimaldi's opened up.

Rock and Brews is great for birthday partys and events because they have enough parking and seating for everyone. In October they have an epic octoberfest with a live polka band.<//Review>

Good food and beer, a bit over priced though. Lots of TVs and outdoor seating.

A couple big bonuses are they have WiFi and you can bring your dog.<//text>

Delicious food - you should go for the giant pretzel with beer cheese if you want an app! The whole atmosphere of the place is great. Would love to go again whenever I’m back in town.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Just awesome. The prices are really good, for the quality you get. The ambience is not comparable to a sports bar. The service is friendly, nice and in good shape. My recommendation.

(Translated by Google) There is no way not to give maximum rating to the most roquenrrou bar on the planet !!! The portions are giant, options to lose sight, gigantic mugs and clinking beer, insane drinks, sensational decoration !!!! Intense vibe, sonzera rooting to the stalk ... Worth every second !!!! Unmissable!!!!!!
