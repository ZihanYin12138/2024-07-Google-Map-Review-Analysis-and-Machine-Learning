I filed at the end of April. I have not received my return. It is now July. Where is my money? I have gotten no answers aside from a date will be provided. Funny thing is if we the people owed you money. You wouldn't have a problem attaching to our bank accounts. Why can't we do this to you as it looks like you guys owe alot of tax paying citizens. This is just nonsense. Where's my money????< /Review>

<review>absolutely terrible I JUST want a confirmation where the office is located but I keep getting tossed back and forth between robot calls recommending I call that number which that number says they don't do calls and appointments anymore. Disgusting, all I want to do is talk to a REAL representative to know where the office is at to make sure I'm going to the right one.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>It's April 2021, and they still haven't filed my 2019 return that I filed in March 2020, which has made us ineligible for stimulus checks.  I'm told that our return is probably lost, but also told not to file a 2nd return.  So basically, they're keeping over $8,000 from us due to their own incompetency.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Talked to one person transferred to another who verified my payment plan was indeed set up automatically then for some reason stopped he gave me a PIN number transferred me again after being on the phone almost two hrs to a lady who answered and hung up on me . I tried calling back and all lines were busy automated line telling to call back tomorrow . Now today is the last day to settle when I received this letter Thursday the weekend is closed .. praying the office will help I have two dr apts and this is extremely stressful.. to try and get done .. someone should have called me back .. after going through all my personal info and giving me a pin . When I’m clearly trying to settle the matter..< /review>

Waited on hold for 30 minutes, provided my information to the woman. She needed to transfer me to another department so I could verify my identity, which included another 40 minute hold time. The man comes on the line, asks for my information, then proceeds to tell me he can’t help me and then hangs up. What a waste of time!< /Text>

<text>I wish I could give them -10 million stars for their service. 15 counter with only 1-1/2 staff members serving 2 people in an hour. They need to be faster anybody else in the world coz people come to pay money, which is very hard. Over the phone also worst experience, no 1 answer for ages, never get to right person, can’t get a solution all together BS!!!!!!!!!</text>< Pictures>

Aside from a long wait (which I expected,) my experience was excellent.  I arrived at about 930am and waited for about two hours to get to see a rep.  I met with S.W. who was very friendly and knowledgeable.  She had my frozen refund unfrozen in about ten minutes.  I'd previously spent hours on the phone trying to resolve this.  The office seemed to operate in an organized manner and the security guard was also helping people.<//Text>

IRS made a mistake and did not credit our tax payments. We sent a copy of the canceled check along with a letter of explanation and they ignored it... sent another bill with penalties again.

So 1 hr on the phone later we finally get someone on the phone.. they said they couldn't help.. had to transfer us.. not another hr on hold.  The first person could not supply a direct number to this dept should be be cut off..  We would have to call back and do it all over again.

The IRS shows complete lack of respect for tax payers and refuses to take responsibility when they screw up.  They think we have nothing better to do that deal with them.<//text>

Why can't I talk to someone over the phone about the letter I was sent, says there's too many calls and I should call back later? Obviously not everyone can make it to your low staffed location, now their low staffed in customer service. HIRE more people if your so slow!! IRS needs new leadership, this is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>

Hello, I need your help guys. Can I get a non-driver's ID from the Sacramento revenue Office? I'm so confused. Your help or any suggestions will be of great help.

Horrible horrible.took forever there was one window open ten minutes after it was closed. One person working and he didn't know what to do. It would be faster to drive 3 hours away and drive 3 hours back rather then go 30 and wait 5 hours just to be told they couldn't do anything. Never go here. This place should not even be open. On top of everything you couldn't find the building.<//Review>

Many of the employees must be political appointees because they certainly are NOT qualified. Two days on the phone to get to someone to tell me to talk to someone else. That man I got could qualify as the most ignorant individual in the dept. He put me on hold but apparently was still listening. When I told my wife he acts like he's tired of working there he cut me off. Now I will try driving the 100 miles to get service.<//Review>

The office is there. But you have to call to speak to someone to get a few answers. Wasted 30 minutes in line. Called the IRS and had about 11 representatives give me 11 different answers to my 1 question. I spent 40 hours on the phone till I got to the bottom of things. 35 hours of these I was on hold.<//Review>

Stood in line for 2 hours to get the WRONG paper from one of the employees named LEWIS.
Had to come back stand back in the line again.
Would never ever come here if this was not the only branch they had. Horrible Management

Extremely dis-satisfied.< /text>

I tried to call to file a complaint against a past employer because they didn't send my W-2 but all I got was a recording and then the phone hung up without any instruction on where to go to next.</Review>

< review>
I brought my cat here to get neutered. His surgery went fine and the staff that helped me the day of his surgery was very helpful and nice. Unfortunately they forgot to give me his pain medication when I picked him up, they called me about 30 mins later to let me know that I could come back to pick up the following morning. I showed up the next morning at around 6:45am to pick up the medicine. There was a staff member walking in as I pulled up so I called to her. She first rudely rolled her eyes as she turned and when I asked her if I could simply just get the medicine they forgot to give me the day before she told me I had to wait until 7 am. I don’t see why she wanted me to wait another 10-15 longer for a mistake they had made on their part. Word of advice if you don’t like helping customers so early in the morning then find yourself another job we’re you won’t find yourself having to be rude to people you don’t know. It brings down the great customer service experience that other people in your establishment work so hard to achieve.< /review>

They tried keeping my dog. Told me she came in without a collar but posted a picture with her collar on and removed her tag with her ID number. They were very rude when I called and didn't believe the dog was mine . I even told her what collar she had on and they still proceeded to lie. They also shaved her without our consent even after we had already made an appointment to pick her up. They also are very very slow. They take forever just for a simple task.< /Text>

< Review>
Dogs abandoned at my home I been trying since  6 am to get them picked up by some one on call.Their tied to my mailbox crying scared prob hungry. Asked me are they aggressive? How would I know..not goin to find out and the growl they made towards my husband doesn’t mean their aggressive..their scared!! All three dispatchers 3 Riverside Sheriff 1 animal control all rude!!! How would they like to be abandoned and tied up their? I been up since 6 listening to them cry when I have to work shortly!! If after hours on call doesn’t exist then don’t have it as an option on your recording and don’t give me an attitude when I am tryin to be sure their safe as well as my family!!!< /Review>

< Review>
Google says they close at 6. I showed up at 5:35 with a feral cat in a trap who needed to be fixed and released - but had to load the trap (and the cat) back into my car and figure out what to do with her overnight. Turns out that the shelter closed at 5:30, and only the clinic is open until 6. To broadcast strictly that they're open until 6 is highly misleading, and the advertised hours should conservatively state the earlier of the two closing times.<//Review>

Beautiful little park! It’s a cute hidden gem that seems perfect for kids! There’s decent room to walk around with my dog too.< /review>

<Review>Aliso Viejo really knows how to love on their Children! This amazing park has a Pirate Play themed set that would make Sea World Blush. My children had an Awesome time here and we even went on a small walk after we were done. It could really use a restroom and drinking fountains being that our kids wanted to stay here longer. Have a Very Blessed Time!!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpT65U0lOJzNnekrs1DYRExTesRVeO1uucFE1P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>This is a beautiful park set back from the street. The playground equipment is new and kept my 4 year old entertained for about an hour. There are nice pathways winding around and up the hills in the park and plenty of grass. I rated this as 4 stars only because there isn't a bathroom.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Nice small park with a new playground that looks fun for younger and older kids. No restrooms, and people have been known to let their large dogs run loose here, otherwise it would get 5 stars.</text>

<Text>Thankfully they are helpful when ordering. First time here and no, it's not like reading Greek, it's Vietnamese!  Everything is made fresh as ordered and you can even watch. It's really not a place I would sit and hang out at, but rather just pickup and go. I ordered 3 different rolls and I LOVE the peanut sauce. Next to Roberto's Taco Shop and easy in easy out!</Text>< pictures>

Absolute powerhouse of a spring roll!  It was so good mater of fact that it inspired me to try and recreate at home... after I failed.. I came running back here to once again to see the right way to do the craft.</Review>

< Review>
I ordered the combo 3 vegan for take out. Upon picking up, I found the storefront to be very clean, bright and inviting. My meal was superb! Everything from the tasty sauces to the heart vegetable soup to the piping hot egg roll to the fresh spring roll... All deliciously fresh and scrumptious. A new regular lunch spot for me!<//Review>

<Review>They specialize in spring rolls my favorite! If I lived in San Diego this definitely would be my go to spot. Our first meal off the plan visiting from Phoenix my 'vegan veggie tofu' soup was delicious. We definitely will be revisiting this spot 👍 😋 and adding it to our 'great foodie' list.<//Review>< pictures>

Spring rolls are fresh and the sauce is amazing!. Whatever you get you won't be disappointed and the price you can't beat.< /Text>

I had a pho roll with beef and a spring roll with avocado and shrimp, and a Vietnamese coffee. The inside is also very clean and decorated cutely. I also appreciated the kind service. I’ll definitely be back and I recommend this place.< /Review>< Response>

I love this place. The Spring rolls and Egg Rolls are delicious. I recommend the Shrimp and the Beef Spring rolls. I recommend the Pork Egg roll. The Shrimp Noodle Salad Bowl is bomb and the Pork Banh Mi is bomb.<//Text>

<Review>This is my go to place for banh mi sandwiches. I always get a spot in their lot. It's conveniently located inn Hillcrest.
The sandwiches have a wonderful sauce that is mildly spiced. I would post a picture but we eat them too fast.
We also get the spring rolls, which are tasty.
They serve a full Vietnamese menu with all your favorites cooked to order.
Giver them a try, you won't be disappointed.</Review><rate>5<//rate>< userid>

<Text>The food is amazing here! Ordered this for the first time, and got the combo #1, combo #2, pork banh mi, and coconut coffee. Love that the combos come with a variety of little appetizers and incredibly delicious spring rolls, with different meats and crunchies inside. Their peanut sauce is the best thing you’ll ever taste. Loved everything. Will definitely be coming back again to support this local business!<//Text><time>1607811338284</time><UserId.>114722676182133333427</UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>I am from Arizona visting SeaWorld during Springbreak. First time visit this Goi Cuon after seeing good reviews. OMG...Bánh Mì (sandwiches) are so good as I, my wife and kids love them. The coffee is perfect and delicious too. I am going home tomorrow and will stop by again to grab some Bánh Mì and Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk on the way home.

<review>Excellent quality and variety of fresh and fried spring rolls! Service has always been fantastic. But it must also be noted that during the pandemic, Goi Cuon has remained at the top of my list of restaurants where I feel safe due to the precautions taken by the staff here. Get take-out today, tomorrow, and the next day! Fantastic!!<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I have been obsessing over spring rolls for the last couple of years and I seemed to be the only person I knew who would go out to dinner for spring rolls. Yes, just the spring rolls. I finally found my people within my niche at Goi Cuon. 🥳

The restaurant has an open floor plan, it has a calming atmosphere, and no one is in a rush. I was able to stand at the counter for a good 5 minutes reading everything on the menu with no one hurrying me along. Customers knew it was no big deal to go ahead of me and the cashier was attentive to the situation.

I really liked that the open floor plan allowed for a view of the kitchen! I am not a health & safety inspector, but what I saw, I liked. Extra extra bonus for the hair nets - thank you ladies!

My order:
* Non-sweet iced Jasmine tea: $1.99
* Sugar cane shrimp, crispy snack Fresh Spring Roll: $3.00
* Avocado Strawberry Fresh Spring Roll: $3.00
* Grilled Chicken Pho Roll: $3.00
* Shrimp Crepe Roll: $3.75
Total with tax: $15.88

Food grades:
* The Jasmine tea - I got what I ordered. 4 outta 5. Will order again.
* My favorite roll, surprisingly, was the wild card - “sugar cane, crispy snack fresh spring roll”. I bought it on a whim thinking ‘what does this even mean’ and I am glad I did. I will recommend to a friend. Just try it!
* Second favorite: grilled chicken pho roll. Never had a roll quite like it. It’s a must try.
* Least favorite: shrimp crepe roll. It didn’t taste bad, I just wasn’t fond of it.

Bonus points: homemade peanut sauce. Never had a peanut sauce quite like this. Amazing job!

Likes: friendly, detail oriented, great selection, cleanly, fresh & healthy food, reasonably priced

Will order next time: Spring roll salad. Yes, that exists!

Opportunity for improvement: once COVID regulations subside I would love to see how you improve the dining section of the restaurant! I would have enjoyed sitting down and staying a while. However, the bench is an aesthetic way to save space - very clever!< /Review>

Amazing, delicious, savory. I got the over-easy organic eggs bánh mì and the tofu avocado fresh rolls. So much better than any brunch I could've ordered nearby.</Review>

This place is AMAZING! The best fresh rolls I have ever had! There are some really good vegan options. They have this really tasty crunch snack that the pit I'm some of their rolls and it is reeeeally good. I go here every time I can, (I see a chiropractor nearby). They also have good Thai tea and coffee, you can either get it with condensed milk or condensed coconut milk.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I was going to Robertos Mexican food shop and saw a new Vietnamese Sandwich Shop next door. I ventured in and it was delicious.

They had tons of options for vegan / vegetarian / pork / chicken / beef. The spring rolls and sandwiches are so fresh and healthy. They also had INCREDIBLE pork egg rolls. Their red sweet and sour sauce as well as their peanut sauce were tasty and great for dipping. You can even watch the chefs prepare the food from outside.

I highly recommend stopping by if you're looking to try new food in the area. I know I was sad when the Indian Food moved down the street, and I'm glad some good food with healthy options is here to replace it. It's the one food place in Hillcrest that actually has parking.< /Text>< Pictures>

It was clear they hired a photographer for the menu, which I thought to be very professional.  The food was served neatly and, while I'm not a food critic, the sandwich I ordered tasted phenomenal, same with the egg rolls.  There was a wide but not overwhelming variety of food items, all neatly categorized and found on the menu.  I came on a Monday night, and the restaurant was mostly empty.  The choice in music was pleasant.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Very good Vietnamese food. Friendly service at this mom and pop. No desserts but good selection of sandwiches, bowls, drinks, and fried options. They used to be farmer's market only but now they are located in this plaza in Hillcrest. Worth a visit if you're in Hillcrest. Decent combo specials.<//Text>

Typically I judge the quality of these sorts of restaurants on their Thai Iced Tea, so when I tasted their excellent (strong, not too sweet, and deliciously milky) Thai tea, I knew I was in a good spot.
I love Vietnamese food, and this place was incredible. The food is top notch, and the staff is incredibly friendly. The woman working the front was incredibly accomadating to our many requests, and was so sweet.
There were also many vegetarian and vegan options which I was very excited to see! The spring roll was soft and fresh, and the Bahn Mi was perfect. Crispy bread, savory fillings, and plenty of mayonnaise. All the sauces served with the spring rolls and egg rolls were amazing too. Best peanut sauce I've had in a long time.
My only regret is that I don't live closer!! Definitely a great spot for lunch, or even a light dinner.<//Text>

Goi Cuon is run by Tham, who started in the Sunday Hillcrest Farmer's Market with a booth, which she still does, but last year finally opened a brick and mortar store. It's located next to Chase Bank on Robinson, across from where Pinkberry used to be and there is a small parking lot in front.<//text>

They do a great job of living up to their namesake, goi cuon, Vietnamese rice-paper wraps. The wraps are great and can include some ingredients not found in more traditional wraps like avocado, strawberry, and eggs (omelet style). They put fresh mint in their wraps which is a plus (which, along with many other traditional greens, is lacking in the majority of Vietnamese establishments' wraps). They have other offerings as well like "pho rolls" (rolls with thick rice noodle as the wrapper), banh mi (yes! baguette sandwiches), fried rolls, and salad bowls (yes! vermicelli rice noodles with leaf lettuce and various toppings). The pricing adds up fast so it's not as inexpensive as you might think. Three of us ate a small amount of food and a beverage each for $40. I would steer clear of the combos ($10) as the added egg roll (not great), dumpling (same), fried tofu (meh), soup (pale, thin broth with veggie bits) and jasmine tea, leave a lot to be desired (there's no value here). They don't have chopsticks (which would be helpful with the salad bowls) which is a shame. Also a shame is the sauces are individually packaged in tiny plastic cup/caps which makes for a lot of plastic waste.< /text>

I’ve taken two of my cars here and I get there at open and both times I’ve been able to just pull right in to get tested. Michael is always professional and friendly. Always prompt. Great price. If you live in the area I would highly recommend getting your vehicle smog testing done here.<//review>

I called around, and several of the closer Smog Check services were over twice the cost. I was pleased to receive excellent, polite and very quick service at a reasonable cost.
If you are in San Leandro, San Lorenzo or Castro Valley, this is the place to go.<//review>

The owner of KS Smog is honest and easy to work with.  The prices are reasonable.  It is my go-to place to get smog checked for all my vehicles.< /Text>

<Text>Michael has an "on-line special for 2000 and older cars/SUV's for $35.00 (with Star Certificate sent directly to DMV).  I was able to confirm the price (break down $26.75 for Smog check plus $8.25 for certificate) on the phone, drove to the shop in the Exxon  Station complex on Foothill, San Leandro, got in and out in less than 10 minuets!.  Michael was extremely professional and likable!  He was very gracious and offered me a few flyer's stating his very excellent deal for my family and friends.  I will return to KS Smog again!  Best deal with the best service!  Thank you Michael!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x808f918b61b991d7:0xc0105e25f514ba5<//Gmap_id></record>

The staff guy conducted himself VERY kind and professional. AND gave me a Yelp coupon discount ($26 for smog test) as a thank you gesture for me choosing his business at a beginning of a very slow day to get my DMV mandated smog completed. He did it in under 15 minutes. Now that's fast!!! He has a very humble waiting room, but I prefer that over some room with a tv show on that I don't care about. Will come again for sure for smog AND for my propane gas refill as well.</text>

KS Smog made it easy. A few cars in front of me when I dropped in, yet mike was able to get me in and out with 30 minutes. He was very friendly and happy to hook me up with the online discount.
Inside the Exxon gas station makes it easy to find.<//review>

Michael was extremely professional and resourceful. He took in my car on a Saturday, no appointment, and I got my smog done in about 15 minutes, with my completed certificate in hand.  I wish I had known about this place for my smog tests in the past.  I've been scammed before at a different place in the South Bay, where my smog check "failed" twice...but I drive a natural gas vehicle!  10/10 will be returning to KS Smog for my future smog checks and supporting this San Leandro business.< /Review>

They're OPEN SUNDAYS!!!! I work 6 days a week and could never find time to get my '03 4runner smogged unless I took time off. When I came across the ad for KS Smog stating their open Sundays I thought it was a misprint. I called and spoke with a Tech named Michale. Dude couldn't have been any nicer. He told me there was a few other folks there waiting but would add my name to the queue of people waiting and he'd be ready for me in 40-45 minutes. I go there 40 mins later and was the next person up. He had to explain to another customer that got there in between my call that I wasn't jumping the line but I called and made an appointment.
I was taken care of and was on my way. I will mos definitely be back to KS Smog when my other car is due for smog check. Service was excellent, professional and prompt.< /review>

i had to get a last minute smog since my dmv registration was coming up. Great location that’s right off the freeway. The guy that helped me was prompt and got me in and out within  10-15min. I’ll be coming back next time I need a smog.< /text>

Looking forward to serving you again.'}</Resp><Review>Long story, I drive a 1987 CRX HF..which in itself is a beautiful, yet complicated vehicle (has about 350k miles). As I was doing an errand for the wife, (picking up furniture for her off of craigslist, you know) It came to me, like a flash from a light bulb that I needed a smog for my vehicle. I asked the person whom I picked up said furniture from and he recommended The gentlemen at KS smog. I went in and the beautiful gentleman greeted me. He did an initial test run and car did not pass. Said beautiful gentleman thought I maybe in need of some sort repairs.....(usually this is code talk for go see my expensive neighbor next door). But this beautiful gentleman noticed a vacuum hose that was not connected, all the while I was quite famished. So I went down the street and got some Spanish food. As I was walking to the Spanish restaurant I noticed car starting to pile up, I was thinking “oh my word is this man gonna get a chance to eat?” So I got him a carne asada burrito, because that’s new friendship and where I’m from we take care of our friends. I finished and he finished and I asked him if I had owed him anything for the extra work he did. This beautiful gentleman decline to charge me extra. I would highly recommend this place to anyone reading this. It was as smooth as a baby bunny hopping upon the grass.<//Review><rate>5< /rate><Pics>None</Pics>< Gmap_id>

This is such a beautiful trail to go on a nice laid back walk! Come here for sunset and you will see the sun set right into the water. Also don't forget to take a couple nice deep breaths to inhale some fresh air from the ocean. I recommend this trail for older people and young kids since it's not bad of a terrain.</Text>

The Pacific Grove beach trail is beautiful at any time of year, but in springtime it's magical. Blooming ice plant and other flowering plants explode with color all along the coast. A must see.< /Review>

A beautiful place to watch the sunset and realize how fleeting life is. This is a beautiful trail, and there are several benches, pavilions,  and trails to ponder on. Enjoy the sound and smell of the ocean and also enjoy life.< /review>

If you can't get down to the beach wherever you first approach the edge of the trail, don't give up. Keep walking around. There are several different approaches to the water, and a few of them are MUCH easier than the ones which seem most obvious at first.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808de118442e7e91:0xea71fa4bec71ad6d</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

In addition, I recommend the city of Pacific groove, the beautiful sunset, the nearby 17-mile entrance, the Monterey Aquarium, the pier, the lover’s corner, etc., are all reasons to stay here. I have visited Highway 1 three times, every time Staying at Pacific groove, every time I am next to the coast, every time I am satisfied. Compared with Carmel, here is less hustle and bustle and looks more peaceful.

(Original)
这里是一号公路沿线绝佳的日落欣赏点，海岸线有碎石，有草地，有房子，给拍摄日落提供了很好的前景。

此外推荐Pacific groove这座城市，绝美的日落，附近17英里的入口，蒙特雷水族馆、码头、情人角等等，都是在这里住宿停留的理由，已经三次游览一号公路，每次都在Pacific groove住宿，每次都是在海岸旁边，每次都很满意。这里相比卡梅尔，少了喧嚣，显得更加宁静。< /text>< user_name>

(Translated by Google) There is a very nice path along the coast to go for a walk, which is much used, because there are also benches, pavilions and great trails. But just to see the sunset, many people come here and sit in their cars.
I was there in November and it blew a pretty breeze, so taking jackets with can be very fresh, maybe they sat in their cars because it was too cold for them.

Es gibt dort einen sehr schönen Weg der Küste entlang zum spazieren gehen, der viel genutzt wird, denn es gibt hier auch Bänke, Pavillons und toll angelegte Wege . Doch nur um den Sonnenuntergang zu sehen kommen hier viele Menschen und sitzen in ihren Autos.
Ich war im November dort und es blies eine ganz schöne Briese, also auch Jacken mit nehmen kann sehr frisch werden, vielleicht saßen sie auch deswegen in ihren Autos weil es ihnen zu kalt war.

So glad that the brewery had opened back up. We've ordered a few samplers to try first. My favorite being the Hazy IPA. The chicken sandwich available that day was excellent and well. The ladies up front were super friendly also. Will return for sure.</text>

Solid line up of beers. I only went to grab some cans to go but would love to stop by sometime soon to enjoy some pints when things get safer to do so. I think they have some restaurants on rotation - when we went, Poor House was dishing out some yummy treats!< /Text>

<Text>We went to zoom trivia the other night for the first time and had a blast. Big patio in the front and back and ample seating inside. We live nearby so we walked, but looks like there was plenty of parking in the front and back of the building. Fantastic beer. Well-run trivia (we connected to the wi-fi and used a phone). It was our first time here but we will definitely be back for more trivia nights.</Text>< pictures>

<review>In A  Nutshell:

-Narrative Fermentations is the only "narrative" I'll pay attention to these days.
-Now that the joke is out of the way, this location used to be Santa Clara Valley Brewing.
-The beer here is phenomenal!
-They are now one of my favorite local breweries in the South Bay.
-When fully operational, they have seating both in front, inside and the back.
-The back is nice & quiet & when it's a nice sunny day w/ Hazy IPA in hand, it's a wonderful thing like sitting in the backyard chillaxing.

Overall, you should definitely come by to check out Narrative Fermentations!</review>< pics>

Yet to have a beer that was mediocre. Everything they have is at the very least good. Just close your eyes and point. You won't be disappointed.</review>

<Review>Even tho we got there late and we only tried 2  beers and 3 items from the food  truck  we have to give it 4 stars.  The beers were very good especially the West Side IPA  which was made with mostly Citra Hops was Delicious!!!
The Asian Fusion trucks food was vary good 👍
Look forward to trying more.< /Review><Time>1601248482869<//Time><UserId.>112496957391401008746</UserId.>< rating>

<text>They've got about a half dozen beers +/- 3 depending on the week. Love their West Coast IPA's. They do a few good hazy's as well, but I'm not huge on them in general. They've also got a few beers on nitro that are always delicious. Used to love SCVB and we definitely are loving Narrative!<//text>< pictures>

Even amid a pandemic that is affecting everything we do, Narrative Fermentations provides an experience that helps you remember the way things used to be.  Tasty beers, friendly staff, and a chill vibe are just what I needed in these chaotic times.</Text>

The beers are phenomenal and they have something for everyone as iv tried their sours to their stouts and they are something you can't help but talk about. Lets not get started on their IPAs as they are truly remarkable. But great beer aside, how I like to judge a place is largely dependant on service and interactions had. These guys have never fallen short of excellent. The staff and owners make you feel as if you are apart of their craft beer family even though you just met. I couldn't feel more justified and excited to support this place and their vision.</Review><rating>5<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><GmapID>0x808e3399af6d3a05:0x977dc20d169f9e30<//GmapID></record>

Made a fabulous find today in discovering Native Fermentations. Great beers, friendly staff and a pleasant afternoon made for a relaxing afternoon tasting new beers under their tents.

I have a feeling we will be back!<//Review>

I have love hate relationship with Big 5. I like the selection, not the staffing. Seems like management does not understand how to hire, train, and staff the business for success. I honestly feel like this is another chain that once did well but has lost its mojo with online shopping.<//review>

Went to buy an air pistol and waited 20 minutes for anyone to help me, after getting the gun the magazine wasn't with it so I decided to go back and see if they have it. I decided I should tell the cashier to send somebody so I wouldn't wait another 20 minutes. Instead, they're all sitting near the front desk talking to each other ( probably about 4). This store is the biggest waste of time and money, they dont care about you or their jobs, DONT WAIST YOUR TIME.
Update, the only person there who could handle guns asked if I had been helped after 20 minutes... it's clear they dont know what there jobs are either.< /Text>

I had to return a pair of Colman steel towed working boots to Big5 because a piece of lumber and a hammer fell on them when my son was working on a school project. He had only had them for 1 day and the leather tore. I am glad he was wearing them when the wood and hammer hit the beginning of the steel toe section because they protected his toes from getting smashed. But I didn't like or think that the leather should have ripped at least 1 inch open. So with my son and husband doubting Big5 would do anything, I took them back for an exchange or refund. The man at the counter was very nice and helpful. He said that he had never seen this before and the boots were a damaged product and check the computer to find that they had 1 pair of side 12 Coleman steel towed boot left. Had another employee bring them to the register and did an exchange for me. So, my son has a new pair of boots to wear while doing the construction at his school. The employee at Big5 said that if it happened again or if their were any other problems with the boots to just bring them back for a refund and try a different manufacture of steel towed boots. I am extremely happy with the results and service I have received from Big5 here in Napa. I will definitely be making more purchases here. Deanna L. Napa, California</Review>

So much in this tiny store. Surprisingly well stoked with goods people need. S art buyers in there! We come for the Heekets, raquet ball, and knee/ elbow protection. Helmets too. I discovered the sport bathing suits and prefer them better because they are made well. Helpful staff too.<//Review>

Not pleased. 1st visit on Friday found the place understaffed. Waited for help in shoes for extended period while staff ignored me while helping another customer who arrived after me. 2 staff stocking shelves also didn't look up. Finally got stocker to find shoe. Told another customer looking for help to tackle guy who was returning to help his chosen customer repeatedly without saying a word to anyone else. Came back next day for exchange. A man did ask if help was needed after another long wait. Upon finally finding a better shoe, approached one side of counter. Salesman was busy on other side. Did say he would be with me but proceeded to help 2nd customer who arrived after. When he was about to help a third arrival, I spoke up, saying the staffing and service were poor but this was for management. He said he was a manager and I told him the problems. He was not that receptive, and somewhat defensive. I recommend Big 5 Napa improve the caliber of its management and increase staffing. An exchange turned into a return. I also won't return.</review>

Please don't put people at the gun counter that don't know the difference between a 22 rifle and a .22 pellet rifle. On the other hand, if you are looking for a great pair of running/walking shoes this place is probably right up your alley. If you hunt or fish go to Sweenys.</review>

Holy! I have to say this is the best bagel bakery I have ever known. My brother worked here at this location back in 1984. One of my best memories. Thank you for keeping us location open.</text>

Polite staff and great food. Only once did I have an order mix up, but it was an extremely busy day. Every other experience there is great. Also the best boba I've ever had.</review>

<Review>Stopped in this morning.  Ordered two vegetarian sandwiches.  They were well prepared.  Bagels were warm and fresh. Also ordered a dozen super seed bagels to go. As usual, they give you a bakers dozen.  Nice touch.< /Review><Time>1543277127155</Time></record>

<text>I used to go often before the name change. I went in today being on that side of the mall I figured I would get a bagel since it’s been a while but they have always been good. Well I go today and get the usual well once I get somewhere to sit the Hispanic women tells me I can’t sit. 🤔 so I get up and decide just wait for my order instead of sitting. Once I get my food and again tells me not to sit there again. So instead of making a big deal I just sit down and ignore her. 😒 Once I start eating I realize I didn’t get the right bagel. 😠 so i just asked for my money back and go get subway. I really want a California turkey. Last time I go there. Good thing there’s a few place in Salinas that have great bagels. Try the one on  constitution.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
Always love the Bagel Bakery.  The NEW makeover to Blazing Bagels looks great.  I would give them a 5 star but my last order was done wrong.  Not sure if it was the guy who took my order or the girls who made it but it wasn't the regular girls I normally get when I get there so they might have been new.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they might have still been in training, following the recipe rather than what the customer ordered or the cashier didn't get it right.  But they still have good food.<//Review>

I wanted them to put my bagel in the oven to melt cream cheese but instead I got a sarcastic remark and a bagel with the cream cheese not melted is it really that difficult to put it in the oven for 30 seconds. Not coming back again< /Review>

No word to describe their services. Pretty much always there for you. The family treat does not matter. You have one truck insurance Or health insurance. They are the best. My all insurance with them since 2014 and always thought of having insurance from them. Nothing no plan to go anywhere else.

Jagdeep. Arundeep and Ateet. Good team. Good people< /review>

I have all my businesses, home and auto policies done by this brokerage. Their staff always there for any concerns or questions. Recently one of my businesses was vandalized and left with a huge loss. Called them and Charu helped me filing my claim. Received my claim check today. It was a seamless processing of claim by Charu and their staff. Thanks for a great service always.< /Text>

They take care of all of our insurance needs including commercial home cars and they are very nice responsive and always try to find best value for whatever product your shopping for .Most of staff is nice but Charu is probably the best insurance service related employee west of New York.</text>

JS Insurance agency is my auto insurance agency for the past one year. The agents named Bedsaira and Priya always helps me with all my queries. They are very good and have a good knowledge on auto Insurance. I suggest all my friends to have them as their insurance agents...</Review>

<Text>Between our business and personal insurance needs we maintain over 50 separate insurance policies ranging from BOP, commercial auto, home, personal auto, worker’s compensation, Life etc and all with the good folks at Jagdeep Singh Insurance. They relentlessly work to find us the lowest premiums and the maximum coverage possible. My personal favorite insurance specialist within their team is Charu Sharma who is a very caring and hard-working individual and literally turns around our requests within minutes regardless of time of day or day of the week. I whole-heartedly recommend this insurance company and will continue to use them for all our insurance needs.

<Review>I always go here. But the last few times the meat was bad. I bought 10 pounds of chicken legs when they were on sale and they smelled so bad. Few days later bought some chicken feet for my dog and they were definitely bad. The smell made me want to vomit. I will no longer get my meat here.
I called and complained but nothing...</Review><gmapID>0x80c353760c37dbcd:0x4c04add0c5ebeb0c<//gmapID>< response>

This is the fifth time shopping here. So far the fruit and veggies look better than any other market in the area and the queso fresco and cakes are good too. Just bought some meat 👍👋</Text>

<Review>I don't do major shopping here, but in a pinch it's great and very near my home. The lines are long and slow at times but the produce usually makes up for it in quality and price. They also have a small kitchen and bakery and we enjoy that as well. The meat counter is also nice with butchers on site.< /Review>< Pics>

Pricing very high for the area that is depressed economically. Business is brisk and selection is okay. Pork chops seemed chewy in nature and rather pricey considering the strange almost frozen texture of the product.< /Text>

Its a nice hometown market. Prices are fair. Place is clean and well stocked. I will return. Most of the "Super" markets like Superior and El Supra are very poorly managed. Over 20 people in 3 lines--they never consider openning another line. I have no problem abandoning the cart and going elsewhere. Rio Rancho has never had that problem.<//Text>

Fresh fruit and vegetables always at low cost. Love their bakery, they make awesome desserts and cakes. Meat can be a little pricey but if you shop when you get there weekly flyers during their sales it’s pretty worth it.</review>

This is a small branch of the Rio rancho grocers chain.   It is a typical Mexican grocery store with great produce a  wide selection of central and South American foods and goods.... I have to say, the homeless problem in this area spills into the parking lot at night and, unfortunately the aroma of their lives is present walking into this store... I have a strong stomach, and even I whimpered and covered my nose when I was greeted by the smell of ammonia walking out of this store.... My hats off to those who brave the same on their way in and out of the place where they buy their food...</Text>

A friend of mine grilled some meat and I liked the way it was marinated, he told me about this place, I was surprised by the low price on meat here, I'm used to shopping at Staters. It was on sale but even the regular price seemed cheaper. Will definitely come back for more whenever I grilled, marinated chicken was $1 a pound, and it came out delicious.</Review>

In  this store which I  visit the Metropcs area to accomodate my phone business and have never gone without a smile from the handlers performing their jobs very professionally and informatively . I give a Mr. BAM , MR . DAOUD and a Ms Edith praise in performances. ! Do look them up if you visit also a wonderful and fresh environment  to shop there .I dance quite often the outside I am a performer ...< /text>

The prices here are pretty much similar to all markets and supermarkets you can however find bargains on occasion for meats and produce,  they have a pretty large variety of Mexican sweet breads that have been extremely fresh every time I have purchased them and are very tasty and enjoyable.</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Be careful!!!! When you get anything from the meat section be very careful to watch the people helping you. They tend not to change their gloves after handling chicken. Also good luck getting any help from them. Stood their trying to get help for at least 10 minutes. As usual i walk up and greet whoever is behind the counter... "buenas tardes" what you get back a blank stare. I thought hmmm maybe they are just busy. So i waited another 5 or so minutes. Looked like they didnt want to help anyone and did everything possible not to see you. Fk this place<//text>< gmapID>
