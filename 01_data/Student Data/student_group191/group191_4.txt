Typical Target store - all the stuff you would expect at this chain. I particularly like to grab stuff in their grocery section. You can get good deals on boxed foods, and there’s some decent produce. Love the furniture and some of the women’s clothes (I like A New Day and Xhilaration brands); baby clothes in here are so cute! There’s also a good selection of make-up and toiletries. There’s a CVS Pharmacy, Cafe and Starbucks inside as well. The employees seem a little rough around the edges lol but overall a clean well organized store. Driving to this complex can be a little tricky. Be safe when coming in and out as it’s right near the freeway. PS there’s a Tesla charging station in this complex.</Review>

Great to see young people jumping into action with lots of energy and smiling faces.  They were great. The line moved quickly for pick-up and everyone was moving happily!  Love to see all this at the holidays.  Thanks for making shopping easy and enjoyable!</review>

This store is so quiet, you can hear a pin drop. Where js the music? The one bright spot is the cheery woman cashier who sings while she works. I find the lack of music off putting.<//review>

Wow what I just experienced on the phone just asking to buy a product from target is beyond me. I talk to a girl Rebecca who should not have a job right now. I asked about football cards and if the vendor was there today. The girl was so rude and unprofessional. She said I'm not going to tell you anything about the cards and even if I wanted to I wouldn't. My boss told me to say it this way. When I asked to speak to her boss she hung up on me. A customer trying to buy something. I will make sure I come by just so I see if this girl still has a job and if she does maybe her boss is the problem.< /review>< Pics>

Yes I am giving the five stars not to the store but to a very helpful young lady named Hannah who answered the phone for me after trying to get a hold the store for 30 minutes she happily answered and helped me find what I needed she was very sweet polite and was telling me she was sorry because no one else answered the phone for 30 minutes and I told her it wasn't her fault she was doing her job it's the stores fault and that I was going to take care of ain't going to know that their customer service is terrible as far as answering any phones cuz not one phone was answered in 30 minutes at every Department I tried which is terrible for customer service just letting you know you need to up your game in answering phones in your store Hannah is a great employee she's a sweet girl who deserves some recommendation a pat on the back and told that she doing a great job I do not know the girl or I have not ever met her but she was very nice to me on the phone and helped me to succeed in my purchase thank you Michelle Luna</Text>

I wish this place had better service, the employees seem really disengaged and don't seem to care if you ask a question, or even if you steal anything. When you ask who's in charge, no one even knows if there's anyone in charge. Almost every contact I have with employees at this location is extremely unprofessional. For example, today I found out the front end manager have been with the company for a grand total of 9 days. it's like the target management don't even care if we get good service or not, there must be some giant culture problem with the employees and or the hiring at this location.< /Text>

Cashier was very nice.
Would be 5 stars except that the paint marking the 2 EV parking spots has nearly completely warn away and gas vehicles were parked in them. Conversely, the online pickup spaces are very clearly marked and no one parks in them, so if they could re-paint the EV spots so it’s clear they’re reserved for EVs that would allow us to shop here more often.< /review>

When I asked them to page the owner of a HOT car with 2 dogs locked inside, I was told that it was not their "policy" to page anyone.  Good thing that the dogs weren't children.  I am unlikely to return to Target. I would rather pay more and shop where the owner has a heart.< /Review>

Aisles were a little cluttered - those huge red basket end cap contraptions choking up some lands - also a lot of items just lying in the aisles.  Friendly staff and fair selection.< /Text>

Have tried to return stuff to the Petaluma target and every time I get nothing but grief from Nancy T.  She is extremely rude.  She makes me feel bad about returning something and not having the receipt.  She actually didn't even let me return a gift I got because it was over $70.  I asked if I could just get in store credit and she said no.  I did not need two jumpers for my baby.  They are so large.  She made me feel like I stole it.  She put me in  tears.  There is no need for this kind of customer service.  I ended up going to another target to return it with no problem.  DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING HERE IF YOU SEE NANCY T.  SHE IS OLDER WITH SHORT BLONDE HAIR<//text>

This was my first time going to a chiropractor and they all made sure I was comfortable. Dr. Anaya is who worked on my neck and back. I am very satisfied. I haven’t been able to turn my head like this in years. Very friendly staff and a lot of laughs. Will be going back!<//Text>

I was visiting the Brentwood area and needed a quick adjustment since I had been traveling and working a lot. I decided to stop in quickly and received excellent care and treatment. Dr. Anaya and Dr. Liz were amazing, fast, and effective team. My adjustment was effective and comfortable. I'm glad I purchased the package so I can stop into any Joint and get expert care.<//Review>

<Text>The dr here is awesome! Jessica takes her time and makes sure you're comfortable. She explains everything she's doing and leaves you with valuable information on the health of your back. My cousins turned me on to this place and ill be a customer for a long time. Price is very reasonable so is their scheduling. The assistant at the front desk is very kind and patient. I recommend this place to everyone.  I initially came in with a pulled muscle and everytime I leave here i can feel it getting better and better. Definitely worth the money!< /Text>< rate>

I wanted to give them more stars, but it has been a nightmare trying to discontinue service. I wrote a letter stating that I was moving back to an area where they do not have "The Joint.".i was talked down to when trying to disenroll.  I called and verified how to discontinue, yet there are charges on my CC for December. A month after discontinue notice. I did not have a steady job for 3 weeks, so the money you all fraudulantly charged my card is my food money. Please give me my food money back for December. I am hungry. Not being sarcastic , but truly in need of my money back. I don't live in the area folks. Do the right thing please.<//Review>

I could barely walk when I entered the Joint Chiropractor. i spent 4 hours on the floor at my house because I couldn't get up the day before...the staff is super nice and very informative. after the adjustment I felt instant relief. I didn't feel the constant pain in my lower back that I had been feeling for 3 days prior. thanks for fixing my back</review>

Dr. Anaya is AWESOME!! 13 car accidents, 4 natural births and the owner of a tax prep biz. That’s a lot of injuries to my neck, lower back, and my shoulder/shoulder blade. And a lot of stress and tension that I carry in my shoulders and neck.  I usually see another chiropractor, who, in his own way is excellent. But my experience with Dr. Anaya has been different. I saw her because I had a pinched nerve in neck and I couldn’t move my arm or my shoulder. Which occurs from stenosis in my neck and some seriously high stress. I had already been to the emergency room (a waste) and my current chiropractor was not available. I wasn’t rushed, although it felt odd that other people were in the same space while I described my myriad of injuries. She felt my neck and shoulder and upper back and whole spine first. She could feel the super tension. The knots. She rubbed them out and used a tool to loosen them up before I ever even laid on the bed. I told her that I didn’t want her to adjust my lower back. We talked about my experiences before. She gently adjusted my injured neck and shoulder and told me to ice ice ice and then had me return that evening to check the adjustment. She made more adjustments and warned me that ice would be my best friend and she was right. But the next day it was already showing signs of healing. I could move it but it hurt like the dickens! I kept the ice on with an ace bandage 24 hours a day!!  I saw her again in 2 days and then two times a week now for the last 4 weeks. Each time we discussed my progress. And each time the adjustment was easier. She suggested a tape (kinesiology tape) to provide relieve and to help strengthen and support my muscle for my neck and shoulder. It worked great too! Yesterday she was able to adjust my lower back. It was the first time any chiropractor got it to “move”.
I will never see another chiropractor again.</Review>

<Review>I was looking for cars in all the wrong places..now I found a truck that turn all the faces..think for many people the first thing that comes to mind regarding a tow yard is not good, it means you got your car impounded & it'll cost big bucks, lotsa time and the misery to get it out.
Not for me, not this time or my last time I was here at US Tow.  This is where I got my Chevy Express Cargo Van last summer & my Ford Econoline Cargo Van over the holidays. Both of these trucks looked nice not the cheap  used car look.  I honestly just turn the key and smooth running and drove them both home.  But I did my homework I know what to look for, what is expect and what price I should be bidding for and I did compare prices of the same make and model being sold on the streets and dealerships. On the average I paid about one-third to one-fourth the price of a used dealership and about half of somewhere on the streets.
The process it couldn't have been easier because you can bid at home online oh, you can see the pictures YouTube videos you go visit yard in person and see for yourself and then they come auction day you can bid with confidence. For me I use my truck for work it's my work survival lifestyle so I've been on truck that I seen running in videos. Those that have mechanical know-how can bid on trucks that are not running and Save Bookoo money or whatever your agenda is. I just know for me the I got one hell of a deal. Is a professionally-run tow yard well secured do they have that shady look to it and everything is on the up-and-up. Photos information VIN number why the car was towed excetera excetera. I tell you I trust you guys more than I trust and overpriced double talkin used car salesman. And of course you going to see the matter what it is a used vehicle so it's going to need the usual repair maintenance by any vehicle but instead of being stuck with a $400 car payment per month you can put $100 towards maintenance. So don't be the unfortunate guy who has to get a car out of the tow yard paying mucho dinero but be the one like me who got the kind ride and save money and drove that baby from U.S Tow all the way home. Feeling blessed and grateful.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Bad this place is thw nest of the los Angeles parking system. They collect your car and even when you deliver them the tittle and the keys they get you into a collection agency and all they say is that is an automated system and that you have to call the agency for them to get you out of the collection. All of this steal could be held by the stupid city council ask them if they know about these issues. Lot of people I met in this office complaint about the same matter.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1608401618997< /Date><username>Julio Martinez</username>< Resp>

<text>Dishonest driver and  staff. The usual tow company shenanigans. My car was returned without: New DeWalt sawzall, battery, charger, air compressor, socket set, my friends purse including money and jewelry, and both of our weed sacks  Its what I've come to expect from tow yards. ( One other thing was missing which will not be named but US tow should test their drivers.)</text>< pictures>

Ray with US Tow was very professional and reliable in delivering my car from West Hills to Rancho Cucamonga. He was very considerate with letting me know when he will arrive since it was a very long drive. He gave me updates of where he was during heavy traffic. When he arrived, he made sure that my car was delivered safely and parked where I wanted it. It was a pleasure meeting you Ray and I will not hesitate to use your services again. Thanks Ray and US Tow!</review>

It's part of the L. A. City ticket racket. If your car gets towed, they'll move it around to different locations, in the hopes that you can't pay the fees in time, and tgen, they can sell it in the police auction.< /Text>

<Text>WARNING! READ BEFORE RECOVERING AN IMPOUNDED VEHICLE!
AVISO! LEE ANTES DE RECUPERAR UN VEHICULO!

If you are going to recover an impounded vehicle and they say that it has parts stolen from it. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.

THIS IS A LIE, THEY SAY THAT SO YOU WILL LEAVE IT SO THEY CAN AUCTION IT OFF!

ASK TO SEE IT BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!
(That's if they let you.)

When our vehicle was stolen in Riverside it was found abandoned in LA and was later impounded. When we went to recover it they (US Tow) had told us that our van had vital mechanical parts stolen and it wouldn't run without them. We had asked to see the vehicle but they had told us that it would be a waste of our time and had suggested to leave it. We spent about an hour arguing so they could give us access to see it up to the point where they were pretty much chasing us out with a forklift. (I kid you not, they were threatening us with a forklift.) When they finally let us gain access there was nothing wrong with it, just a hole in the gas tank.

Overall they were rude, threatening, and treated us like criminals.

This was just my experience with these maniacs and I hope it makes you think before doing business with them.</Text>< pics>

<text>The best place for natural juices. The best staff and most that speak Spanish so I am able to introduce this healthy option to my mom so she can go on her own,thats so nice. There is a section of natural health products to look at;products to aid in weight loss, protein, muscle creams, etc.. They are very up to date with cleaning safety protocols during this season. Awesome place. Highly recommend!</text><user_name>Flavia Ibarra<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Wow! Thank you for the wonderful medicine. Raw vegan lifestyle is easier with you near by. If only you had Kangen Water. What a blessing your place would be for the community. Living water. For living people. Thanks Nevera!</Text>

<review>Wow!!! Yummm!!!! Ordered the Kale Salad and Acai Bowl for lunch thru Uber Eats and couldn’t be happier with the quality, size, presentation and taste

The acai bowl is creamy and sweet. Almost like ice cream. Definitely tied for best acai bowl I’ve had (other is in San Diego)

The salad was great — a little sweet, but fresh chicken that was slightly warm, which is how I like my chicken on my salads.

Quick, easy, delicious and cheap. Will definitely be trying out the whole menu! Thank you Nevera!</review>< user_id>

In the mood for a healthy juice or smoothie? I highly recomend Nevera. The service is fast and friendly and the menu is full of healthy choices. Pre or post workout, Nevera is a good choice. Not into working out? Have a healthy drink and feel better too🤩<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad the juices do not have flavor to what one asks, they do not wash the machines and it has flavor to other fruits that one did not ask apart they forget to put banana to the bionicos I do not recommend it.

Muy malo los jugos no tienen sabor a lo que pide uno, no lavan las máquinas y le queda sabor a otras frutas que uno no pidió aparte se les olvida ponerle plátano a los bionicos no lo recomiendo.👎👎< /text>

I am a customer of Kessler Alair Insurance Services for more than ten years. I can give more than five stars if possible!

With my previous insurer it was a pain to get in contact with them and make any policy changes. Working with David was a breath of fresh air. I loved that I had a direct line to call and didn't have to wait on hold for anything. I got near-instant responses to my emails and, to top it all off, I'm saving money on my insurance now. Really happy with this company!</review>

It's a pleasure to write this review.  David is a joy to work with.  My initial contact was a great, non-pushy call to let me know that he can tune the Mercury quote in my favor.  I decided to give it a go.  Throughout the process David was professional, patient, and always transparent.  I wish all of my professional encounters were as good.
He has earned my business and I am delighted that we connected.</Text>

Got insurance in less than 1 hour. Good prices they also respond really quick. If you don’t have time to talk on phone they can text you or email with quick responses.</Review>

I am glad having David as my agent for my home insurance and their quote is reasonable compared to what I had before. We spoke a few times to resolve the questions I had and the rest was handled through our email communication. It wasn’t too long before I got what I liked very much especially with how busy it is at this time of the year with the holidays. All in all, great work and good job well done. I will look for David again for other insurance matters.<//Text>

I've worked with David a few times and it is always a pleasure. He is very responsive and friendly, and is always available for questions. Very happy with the quote I received on my own vehicle as well. I would definitely recommend David to any and all of my friends and family!</text>

I was very happy with the quote received by David Kessler. My auto insurance was quite high due to my 20 year old son’s driving record and David gave me a rate hundreds of dollars less than my current policy. I am saving around $500/yr when bundled with my homeowners insurance. Thank You David Kessler!</text>

<Review>Very professional office staff with ability to get insurance issues taken care of same day, if needed.  They are always willing to answer any questions and provide assistance with which coverages make sense for our business.  A good solid partner in business, not just another broker selling you the latest hot trends to make a buck.  A trusted partner !< /Review>< user_name>

I'm a very happy new client
I was planning on changing my auto insurance and after 3 try to get a quote with my previous agent who didn't get back to me I contacted Mr Kessler.
I had directly to do with Mr Michael Kessler and he sent me all the info I requested and called me back on promised time, several time until I was happy with the coverage I got. I am very happy with his professionalism and the insurance I got and will recommend him to all my friends and family.< /Text>

KESSLER ALAIR is a great agency. Customer Service is very helpful and considerate. I Have had my policies with them for 15 years + and have never had a issue. Every time I call they are very helpful and thorough. If agents are not able to answer your call at the moment, they get back to you within the hour. Nothing but great things to say about the staff and service. Make the right choice and give them a call for all your insurance needs.< /text>

Kessler Alair has helped me with my home owners and car insurance for the last 10 years. They have always had the lowest rates and the best customer service. Nancy is awesome and answers any questions I may have and Lorraine is always so sweet and kind when greeting me at the Rancho office.<//review>

<review>We have had Kessler Alair as our broker for over 25 years. They have had our back through the many transformations our business operations have taken over those years.  Not only have they always been responsive but they have educated us so that we can make more informed decisions about the types of policies and coverage we need.  Business insurance is extremely costly, complex and something that self-employed individuals don't always want to face head-on. But "Kessler" has always taken the time to make certain we are not under-insured or over-insured.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1565742465163, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your positive words about our agency.

< Review>
Staff was very helpful and friendly. 1st time there was a great experience as I wasn't sure what i wanted and they were willing to go the extra mile to make sure I ended up with a drink id enjoy. Price is low considering the quality is high. Not used to seeing that concept much these days. Will definitely come back.</Review>

Great coffee, great service! Avocado toast is my favorite, but if you don't like red pepper flakes, ask for them to leave it off. And they do waffles!!</text>

Tasty locally roasted coffee, cozy seating area with plenty of tables and room.  Very reasonable prices.  Skip the chain stores and come here.  Worth the drive if you don’t live too locally.</text>

An indie coffee shop with ambiance is just what this area needs. There's a kid friendly area, plenty of electrical outlets and food options. All good things a coffee shop should have in addition to great coffee. Love my dirty chai spicy and this place did not disappoint. Lots of clove and not too sweet. Will definitely come back.<//text>

<Review>Hidden little gem of an independent coffee house. The coffee and teas are great. The baristas are friendly and efficient.  The avocado toast has fried onions on it and is BOMB.  Come check them out, you will not regret it.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The staff is exceptionally friendly and polite, and all the coffee and tea drinks I've tried are amazing. The quality of the beans and espresso is superb - definitely some of the best you'll find on this side of the Bay. Not to mention the GREAT food; I highly recommend the avocado toast, the waffle, chia seed pudding, cheese stuffed toast, and turkey pesto stuffed toast. You really can't go wrong.
They also have kombucha on tap, which very few places have. And it's so yummy!
We go to Big House very often and we've never been disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808ffec197c6443f:0xa773f3c888e3a92c< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>People were friendly but I am disappointed in the coffee. Latte was weak, barely any coffee flavor. So was the Lg Americano. Hard to believe they put 2 shots in, let alone the 3 for a large. I guess One House Bakery In Benicia really is the only place to find a good cup of coffee —and that’s not even it’s specialty!</Review><gmap_id>0x808ffec197c6443f:0xa773f3c888e3a92c</gmap_id></record>

When you need that pick me up you have to visit big house beans! The employees are very nice and welcoming. It’s so hot out I decided to go out my comfort zone and try the affagato ( espresso shot with ice cream) I couldn’t be more happy! Cooled me off and woke me up! They have delicious treats and the absolute best wraps always fresh and tasty.</Text>

I have been here a few times and I love it. The coffee is very good and much better than any other coffee shop I've tried in Brentwood. The avocado toast is very good along with the other foods. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this establishment.</Text>

Supporting the local businesses are easy when they're good. Ordered a Maple latte and Bobs Red Mill waffle, both were great.<//review>

This place is going to do very well here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The coffee and food are unique and delicious. You aren't going to find anything better than Big House Beans Cafe anywhere near here. I am already telling all of my friends about this place. Extra plus, there's a cozy corner with two chairs, a side table between them, a sofa, and a coffee table with a basket of toys for the parents and kids to enjoy! I can't wait to bring a friend and my daughter soon!<//text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>I love that this local coffee shop has a roasting plant right in Antioch.  They also had oat milk as an alt dairy.  I had never had it, and it was super creamy.  They also have almond milk.
Staff was very nice.
Kids toys under a table and out of the way which was a quirky cool thing since our town is very much a family community.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

<Text>Brentwood finally has a good coffee shop! Solid espresso offerings, café fare at reasonable prices, and very friendly staff (big plus!). My barista was Emma, and she recommended the drink I had, the honey latte with oat milk. Delicious and well-balanced, just a tiiiiny bit too sweet. This place could easily become part of your routine. Ask for Emma!<//Text>< pictures>

Worst service ever.  It is TMobil now but the reps must be from sprint cuz I have always had a good experience at TMobil. They were just argumentative and disrespectful,  Go to the one on the other side next to Ralphs. Three young insecure girls all teamed up and started claiming I my tone was aggressive when I questioned the quote I was given.</text>

<Review>My hotspot didn’t work. After 7 times calling sprint and it wasn’t successful. I came to this store. They told me the issue was my phone and they tried to sell phone to mw instead of helping me to resolve the problem. I have been in apple store recently and i know there is nothing wrong with my Phone.< /Review></record>

Me & my wife joined Sprint at the end of February. I checked my charges for the first time today, 7/20, & just found out we are getting overcharged between $40 & 50/ month. Contacted Sprint online chat, discussed the issue  & asked for credit & was told they will look into it. I checked some other Google reviews & noticed we were not the only customers that got charged for something we didn't subscribe for. I'm personally going to the store tomorrow, hopefully store manager who opened our accounts that evening on 2/20/2020 is there & can explain where extra charges came from. Shame on him! & no point that evening he would even ask "how are you?", no "thank you", nothing... Just a blank, serious face of somebody who doesn't want to be there... Writing report to BBB tomorrow.<//Review>

Thank you for wanting to know my experience at the Culver City store today, June 13, 2019. After spending more than two hours there (circumstances beyond their control) Christopher,  who was highly recommended by a Best Buy rep, and Julio who was very patient gave me the best customer service I've ever had in my 11 year history as a Sprint customer, went above and beyond to help me. Thank you guys for all you did today! Also a behind the scenes thank you to store managers Edwin Hernandez and Nestor.<//review>

<Review>Extremely poor customer service.  Went in to upgrade my phone.  They gave me incorrect info about my account.  They had very little knowledge on what items they had in stock.  They had even less knowledge on their new products, including the phone I purchased.  They had to give me the employee guide because they didn't know anything about the phone.  Also tried to make a return days later.  That was an entire other disaster.  DON'T GO TO THIS STORE!

Good luck cancelling Sprint too. Even if you own your phone and want to go to a new carrier they make it almost impossible. They will hold your phone hostage and not unlock it (to use for a new carrier) unless you jump through all kinds of hoops for them. Took me 5 days...Utterly ridiculous! DON'T USE SPRINT!</Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>There were some nice experience workers here. Until they quit and got inexperienced workers. They seem to NOT listen to my concerns and because of that, this sprint ended up costing me $$$. I called Sprint to take my roommate off my family plan since, he was leaving the country. They told me I needed to take him, and bring our IDs. We googled this store and went. When we asked about getting him off the plan, they told us we didn’t need our IDs to do that and that I didn’t need to bring him. The Sprint rep (She) did something on the computer. Then she said he was off. The next 2 month I was paying $7 extra for keeping a number I didn’t need anymore. I went back and told them I wanted my roommate and the number off my plan. Then the manager told me I need to bring him with his ID to get him off the plan. *eye rolls* but at that time, he was already out of the country. I had to do this whole back and forth with Sprint and complained with the manager about how his staff doesn’t listen. They did the same thing when I said I wanted to BUY a flip phone. They ended up leasing it to me. I ended up paying more than what the phone was worth.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Jordan helped me upgrade today and made the process so fast and so easy, she mirrored both my devices and I couldn't be more satisfied. Thank you Jordan haven't upgraded in 3 years because I wanted to avoid the hassle but I'll be going to her for future upgraded! I recommend everyone to go to Sprint on overland and Washington for any inquires and ask for Jordan. Thank you again!< /Text>

< Review>
At first, I was really happy with the friendliness of the staff at this store. I came in to transfer my phone number, upgrade my phone since the sound stopped working on my old one and I was eligible for an upgrade, and get a new contract. Jordan P. assisted me, along with some help from one of the managers, who left the store midway through the transaction. I was told that all of this was possible and that I'd have my new phone attached to the number I'd been using for the past 12 years within the hour and that Jordan would call me to make sure that this happened. After I left the store, I never heard from Jordan and never started receiving the calls/texts from the number that I'd been using and was told I could keep using. I called her after a few hours and she incorrectly told me that everything had been transferred over and that the call she received was from my correct phone number. I tried calling and texting friends and was told that they were not receiving texts from my regular number and that when they called my regular number, it didn't go through. I called Jordan back and she asked me to hold on for a moment. I waited on hold for 45 minutes and she never returned and in the meantime, the Sprint Store closed. I then got a call from a Sprint representative who informed me that my number had been claimed by a Verizon user. I have been on hold/on the phone with Sprint and Verizon for the past 4 hours, and it doesn't look like I'm getting my number back. This has taken up my whole day when I was told it would be something easy that would be done in less than an hour. I'm disappointed with the incompetence of the staff at this store and feel like I was flat-out lied to and then avoided.< /Review>

Amazing customer service!! As soon as I waked in Alfonso greeted me and made me feel welcomed. I came in just inquiring about the service and he got me to switch over to Sprint 😊 If you visit this store he's the guy to see. I've had a great customer experience so far with this carrier, love it this far! Thank you!< /review>

She also broke down my monthly savings. So you can say she is extremely knowledgeable, quick, and very professional. I would recommend her to my mother and grandmother to work with her.

I was in a real bind with my phone situation.  My phone was in pieces, no insurance, still owed for the phone, at the time I had been without a phone for 8 days.  I had been to a different Sprint store earlier in the week and also had talked with Customer Care on the phone and both basically had said that I was going to pay $400 + up front to get a new phone.
I walked in and to my surprise there was no wait, Dwayne was prompt to greet me and find out what I was in need of.  I explained my situation and was waiting for the bad news.  But this time I was given an option other than pay a lot out of pocket. He said I could add another line to my plan and get a brand new phone to use.  Although my bill would go up slightly more a month, it beat more than $400.
At this point Alfonso, the Assistant Manager overheard my situation and said he could help even more.  He went above and beyond to make things happen for me.  He got me upgraded to a better plan at not additional cost.  Alfonso got me all set up with a new phone and toys to go with it.

It took some time to get it all done because of my situation and it also required Alfonso to make some calls to Sprint Care in order to get everything in order.  He had no problem taking an hour to get everything perfect and in order.  I know some people walk in the stores and want the sales team to snap their fingers and you are out the door.  But it takes time. (Make an appointment to be safe)
When I fist walked in there was only 1 other guest being helped.  So I got helped right away, I considered myself lucky because I didn't have an appointment.  As guests came in they were promptly greeted and helped.  Caesar and Jordan were both conversing with me about my phone situation but were quick to help the guests as they came into the store.  I will be going back to see this crew whenever I need anything dealing with Sprint.< /Text>

Christianne was so friendly, helpful and professional. When my current phone was dying, i went to best buy, radio shack and the sprint store.  It was a horrible day.

silver lining:No one was able to help me as efficiently and pleasantly as Christianne.
First of all she was really fast, but she took the time to listen to my concerns and she really found the best plan for my family.

I was so impressed, I brought more people to her store to her.
Who wants to wait forever at a phone store or hear useless promotions?
She really respected my time and needs and addressed them.

I am really please with her service. I would not hesitate to go back if i needed anything else.

Thank you!<//Text>

I had the worst experience in this store. Costumer service is the worst. If the assistant manager Britney trying to help you, just walk out of the store or get someone else to help you.Otherwise she will keep saying clam down and not help you with your stuff, the worst part is she won’t even let you talk to her manager.</Review>

Horrendous, incompetent customer service. Not only did the five people "working" not know how to handle my issue (emails not pushing to my device), but they deleted my email account without informing me that, in doing so, they would be deleting all of my Notes as well. Unretrievable and not-backed-up, I lost 92 items that I needed and valued. When I called in to ask for assistance, I spoke to a man named Antonio who was extremely rude and apathetic. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he'd call me back and he never did. Not only is this store unhelpful, they're a liability. Do not trust your technology or important data to them!< /review>

(Translated by Google) I did win it because my husband bought a phone. I don't know how the purchase deal was. I think it went well because he was happy.

Mixed review.
New construction and amenities  are good things.
Sad part most of the amenities are closed and apartments are less spacious. Security is good.</Text>

<name>Marbella Price< /name><date>1580413240928<//date><rate>5</rate><Review>My family and I moved here last June and we are very happy with our experience here so far. This has been the best place we have ever lived. Move in can be tricky due to the fact the building are brand new you have to call to get certified gas technician out to turn it on. This depends solely on the Gas companies availability. So the stove heat and dryer took two weeks to get on in the meantime my family and I used the Showers I the Gym and make our meals in the microwave the grills and in my instapot. Now that we have been here for 7-8 months, we honestly enjoy all the amenities. Additionally the Management is exceptional!!! They are professional, kind and attentive. Even on the busiest days you can rest assured they are doing their best to keep the community clean and happy. Maintenance request are easily submitted through residents application where you can upload pictures and the urgency of your problem. Not that this place needs much maintenance due to the high quality of the apartments. Once submitted the maintenance only takes a day maybe two if you mark priority as low. Overall my family and I highly recommend making this your new home!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3tfF0j_f7k5PQPjft3YMuvYfncOJCCaBsrzbX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF-ZJrYU8e0AhRKarNYvsjNesrht_Pgmu-h4zz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlabxu6Rw5DPOMsVFvt3zmUprp6uMFgOe5CNoR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAaxZ5iAYTJAiL-iImWfKRexIMnEJl_m6jwoZq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPddJ7IroBH6axDuq6OTVKPemUvmZxHocW24DN4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipML1SQxh5ScNhe37AKhYySislKAg-w6tdmLLmRs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmv3rvIz4wxb4UeY6X7Xf2prB4ishyN9J3uct3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv009ZZ_M1Mdop2Zapy11ZgLk7GeVS2RTLeioo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMv-nu6CfyFSSFal1Hg_Y3yIn9mZN2gmTF1-8C6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c335acd0931fb3:0xe634ee3350ec441f</Gmap_id></record>

I see a lot of reviews that are negative. I had such a nice time living at this apartment. The building I lived in was clean for the most part and semi quiet except for the dog upstairs.. but that is unavoidable. No bug problems. No robberies or break ins. The gyms and pools recently opened and there is wipes to clean the machines. Living here is decent.<//review>

This is an expensive place for what you get unless you like paying for dirty common areas and cockroaches. Entertainment includes fights in the parking lots and security guards laughing as they video tape.  If any apartment complex took advantage of taking away amenities due to a virus, this is one of them.< /Review>

I’ve lived in one of the newer buildings for 3 months now and have been really lucky with barely any neighbors. I love living on the first floor where we have plants guarding our balcony and can conveniently sit out on the furniture outside if there are guests. Also, most everyone that lives here is really friendly and greets each other, which I’ve never experienced before.<//Text>

I really thought I would be the only one with a negative review on this place considering how nice the complex is on the outside. Unfortunately, I have also had a bad experience with my stay like others in this review section. The office staff is very hard to reach; called numerous times and never got a call back even after voicemails. The central air in my unit has been out for nearly two weeks. Several technicians have "come" by to fix the issue, but seems like they are just checking it off as good because it still is not fixed. I really wish the staff was as fast/helpful to help with these issues as they are in getting new people to sign a lease. Had to make several trips to the leasing office just to get some sort of assistance. In conclusion, if you care about service and not just the looks of the apartment, look elsewhere. I don't like having to do this, but it's been a pretty frustrating experience so far. Hopefully they can up their staff!</Review>

Don’t be fooled once they get your money and you sign the contract they absolutely don’t care about you whatever. The cleaning staff and front guards are the only nice ones everyone else in the office staff ignoring your calls can stick it.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The apartments are said to be luxurious and they look very pretty on the outside, but when you step inside you realize how much money they spent hand painting the walls buying cheap furniture etc. The worst thing here has to be the leasing office, they never know what they are doing, and the people who do know are never there. I wouldn't live here especially if its temporary, because they treat you like a complete joke.

<text>I was recommended through a coworker who was at the time a new tenant and was told that both them and I would receive a special for referrals. Initially the leasing staff was very friendly and welcoming. The apartment at the time was still new and the amenities were open and almost always clean. After 4 months of living there my eyes were opened to the harsh reality that the management wasn’t as angelic as they seemed beforehand. One time after a long graveyard shift I returned to my apartment only to find my keys were missing so I called the property manager for assistance and was immediately ridiculed, disrespected and disregarded. I was told that it was not his problem even though he had the keys to open up my apartment so I had to call a locksmith, all while my dog was alone and frightened. The locksmith took over 2 hours to get there and open the door when the property manager could of easily opened the door for me on top of that I was charged extra fees for late night services. When it came to time to refund me for my security deposit they gave me the run around then sent the check to the wrong address, so I had to wait for another check which took weeks to arrive. Overall they left a bad taste in my mouth, I do not recommend moving here if I could leave zero stars I would. The leasing office never returns calls or emails so you need go to in person to handle any issues. Don’t fall for the 14 months lease either. Due to the first month incident where they undercharged the first months rent and then raised it the following month they charged me a late fee for no real reason and raised rent fee without notice so after that I’d pay $35-$50 over Incase that problem reoccured and I’m still waiting for my return on all the overpayment they received from me.</text><Date>1601693798693< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x80c335acd0931fb3:0xe634ee3350ec441f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Although these are considered “luxury” apartments there’s not much luxury about them. The apartment itself was horrible. When you turned on the A.C it was super loud you couldn’t have a decent conversation. Lived on the second floor so the residents who lived on the third floor were always loud. Day and night they were always stomping on the floor so when I called the front office they didn’t do much to handle the situation. This machine in the lobby was always going off and beeping it literally lasted two months like that. The residents had no respect for the building. They would leave their trash and the janitors didn’t do anything. I’d rarely see them. The first come first serve parking was now being added to your lease so they were charging fees on the free parking sites. The only thing that was convenient about these apartments was the gym and the pool. Better off paying rent for a house than paying rent here that’s way too high and not worth it.< /review>

< review>
After living here for a year I have a lot of mixed feelings about my time spent at the Paseos. I chose not to renew my lease after the 1 year term in spite of my initial excitement due to the beautiful location, the great amenities and the brand new apartments. 3 stars for that. Unfortunately some of the tenants at this locations don't feel any pride in ownership. There's often trash in the hallways, people who let their animals go wherever they please, and many who just refuse to clean up after themselves or their pets. Although the staff is personable, many times I have been left in the dark in spite of repeated phone calls or emails. Left to wonder if my question or concern will be addressed. It was only through my repeated efforts that the issues were resolved. Someone once said, "Actions express priorities".

Although I recommended a few friends in the beginning, I can't recommend the Paseos further. If what you want is what you see on the surface, then perhaps it'll suit you better.</review>

Management does not intervene with loud upstairs neighbors even if the neighbors are consistently loud everyday for hours at a time. Moved out earlier this year and informed the leasing office they charged me for another apartment (had proof of the charge on the documents they gave me) but they still haven’t corrected the error after countless calls for the past 7 months. In addition, I called again this morning and they lady keeps hanging up the phone before I can say hello. Thought it was a mistake the first time but she did it again 2 more times! Look elsewhere to spend your money. Save yourself the headache.<//review>< pictures>

Let’s just say - most, if not all of the low reviews and complaints mentioned so far are accurate by our accounts.  The staff are only interested in you if you are ready to sign a lease at that very moment.  If you are not, don’t expect any follow up, I’m convinced they have absolutely no idea what “customer care” means, or “customer retention” !  We stayed 6 weeks, lived in a sub standard poorly constructed apartment, multiple faults consistently, and the staff would not give you the time of day, once you had signed the lease.  The management at their local head office are responsible for such diabolical and disgraceful service and after care at this facility, as the staff on site are only doing as they are trained to do.  Stay away, stay far away.< /text>< Pictures>

They have 4 different numbers to call to reach someone in the office but with those 4 numbers nobody knows how to pick up a damn phone call. When they say they’ll call back they never do as well. They don’t know how to answer a phone call. Very unprofessional service.<//Review>< Time>

It is not safe, there are break ins and robberies. The staff is terribly rude once you rent. They are one way until you have signed the lease and then they change. They claim to be pet friendly and they absolutely aren’t! If your dog barks then they will evict you if someone complains. The air vents in every unit are so loud you can’t hear the person next to you. These are very cheap apartments and can only be claimed as luxury because they are next to the airport. Move on and spend your money somewhere else. You can get a nice 3-4 bedroom house for what you spend here.< /review><GmapID>0x80c335acd0931fb3:0xe634ee3350ec441f</GmapID>< Rate>

<date>1576646218566</date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I haven’t even lived here a month yet! My first week I had NO heat for about 4days I HAD TO ASK them to give me heaters. Outlets in the unit were not working. My dishes IS STILL NOT WORKING. On two different occasions I had to rest the fuse box because a wall in the living room will go out and a wall in my sons room will go out. Someone else mentioned on here how friendly staff is during leasing but YES after signing they are RUDE, NOT helpful and make you feel like a bother when NOTHING works in these “new luxury” apartments. And YEA someone else also mentioned cheaply made. TOTALLY agree, along with all my issues here the walls are SUPER thin, floor feels cheap and also there is hardly any storage room in the units. This place is all about numbers, it’s HUGE they just care about filling up the units there is not enough staff to maintain the units here. Luckily I’m not paying too much because I got a deal but I WISH I would of stayed at “The Grove” in Ontario. I cannot wait till my lease is up. Hate the unit and I hate the staffs attitude and they NEVER respond I have to be like their mother and keep on their butts to get anything done around here. Don’t rent here!
**UPDATE,NOT SURE WHY ITS NOT LETTING ME RESPOND**
Thank you for your quick response. That’s the fastest response I got since moving here. The ONLY reason I’ve been in the “loop” is because of ME in the one consistently calling the office and emailing trying to figure out what is going on. Also after the vendor came to fix the heater. The other heaters brought in sat here because your staff didn’t take them. I had to call to get them removed. Also been waiting for the dishwasher to be fixed since the 11th when the vendor himself said he would be out with the part. Also I am not the first person in this residence I was told there was someone before me for 6months. Guess they didn’t use all the outlets or heater or dishwasher.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c335acd0931fb3:0xe634ee3350ec441f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The fact they they had me place a holding deposit then provide me with the lack of response is not professional and it’s disppointing.  What i thought would be a great experience has turned into horrible one. Based on the professionalism of the team I would not recommend to anyone.</review>< Pics>

I just moved in about 2 weeks ago and I must say I'm so glad I did,It has everything you need that you dont even have to leave home! The game room with a 80inch tv is awesome! The gym is so cool and the pool feels like I'm in Vegas! The staff who works there are very friendly and really make you feel at home.Anna who helped us personally is so nice and so professional at what she does. If you are moving to Ontario or the IE I highly recommend Paseos at Ontario!</Review>

<Review>My oil change was done as quick as the man working could do it.

But when we got there the front door was locked so we had to go through the garage (which seemed strange). Then the credit card machine wasn't working. Also, there was only one man working there who didn’t really know how to use the computer stuff.

I had made an online reservation for a couple things but then since it was only him and I was already an hour later than my appointment time, I didn’t bother.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I brought my 25 year old Jeep Grand Cherokee to Meineke.  My long Time mechanic can not solve squeaking sound.  Tom (store manager) and AJ (top mechanic) were determined and resourceful in finding the source of the problem and even more resourceful in finding 25 year old barley existing parts.  After a few days of hard work, I came home with my Jeep that drove like it is new.  They having amazing  service and have super smart staff.</Text>

<text>After changing out my spare tire I stopped by this place to ensure the lug nuts were tight before hoping on the freeway. Of course I was planning on tipping for the service. However, the man asked if I was going to tip him, he said at least 5 dollars. The fact he demanded a tip and his demeanor was horrible customer service. Good luck earning more business, maybe that's why the place looked empty.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rate>1<//Rate>< resp>

<Review>Thanks Sid.
I have been here twice already and from now on this will be my permanent place to get an oil change. Sid is honest and knowledgeable an puts effort in solving any car problems and so was the service. He did a free inspection so worth my time here. Totally will come back again.<//Review>< Pics>

QUALITY ?.. We'll SEE within there  warranty period. I was here twice already & known them already.. should I complain? Nope.. I'm Ok. Just wondering why there business usually slow, you'll be attended easily.. well.. find it out.

<text>LAZY LAZY LAZY. Especially the "manager". I've gone to them twice. The last time I walked out. 1.5hr for an oil change? Instead of him telling my his mechanics went to lunch, he went on telling my how complicated my car (2010 Camry) is they're looking for a "part". I guess trying to... buy time. Finally 30mins later I asked about "the part"  And when I asked about the part, he totally blew me off and walked and sat in his car. Maybe I would have been treated differently if I was a man, but give me a break!</text><Resp>{'time': 1536180258450, 'text': "We're disappointed to hear that your experience was anything less than positive, as providing our customers with efficient and honest care is of the utmost importance to us.

The workers were pretty nice. Fumbled a bit on the computer but won't hold that against them.
Gave me a discount for being a first time customer.

The synthetic oil change came out to about $68. Not too bad a price, but a little expensive considering that is including the discount.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Name>Mary Luteran<//Name><review>I recently relocated to the area and chose Pacific Pet Hospital because of proximity to my house and the reviews.  I have 2 cats; both of them have one issue or another and one of the cats requires sedation just to be examined. I was nervous because it was important to me that their new doctor understood their medical histories and I know that the office is quite busy.  Both Terry and Dr. Humphrey listened to my concerns without making me feel as if I was taking up too much of their time.  Terry explained a lot about their practice and what was happening during their exams, and Dr. Humphrey spoke to me about each cat and answered all of my questions.  I had a similar experience on my second visit to this practice.  While waiting in the car (Covid precautions), I watched the staff deliver pets to their owners and it was evident that the staff have built relationships with other clients.</review>< Time>

I was looking for a veterinarian ever since moving and happen to give this business a chance.

I was pleased how freindly and kind they were while offering their services. Due to the Covid-19 rules they have, they take pets from your car at curbside, and talk to you over phone. I made an appointment on app and brought my cats for routine check ups with no worry.

Overall, it was a good experience, and I recommend going here!</review>

Great customer service at a decent price. Vet services are much more expensive than what I was used to living abroad, but I didn’t feel like I was being taken advantage of. I brought both my senior dogs here for annuals. My oldest ended up needing a tumor and some teeth removed. My final bill was broken down to where I understood what I was being charged. The Vet techs were very friendly and communicative, as was the doctor. I do have to wait in the parking lot (which can get busy) for a tech to pickup and drop off my pet, but the wait times don’t feel exorbitant. Will be making this place my primary vet care.<//text>

<text>I just adopted a dog and brought her in for her first vet visit. I decided to come in after reading all of the positive reviews and they deserve every single one of them. I did not feel rushed or like I was an inconvenience. They took the time to explain procedures and answer all of my questions, did not push services I was uncertain about, and everyone from reception to vet techs to the Vet Dr. Humphrey, were all extremely friendly, attentive and reassuring. Thank you!</text>< gmapID>

I LOVE Terry the nurse, but honestly it feels the last couple times they have gotten too busy to give good service.  i had to call 3 times to get lab results and then the fill in dr. said they would follow up.  nothin.  not impressed in the last year out of 9 years going.</text>

<review>I have been taking my dogs here for a couple of years and the staff is always so friendly and informative. I especially like their on-line booking where the visit is half the price than not booking it on-line. Their website is very user friendly and I can also order medications through there and get it mailed to my house. I would highly recommend Pacific Pet Hospital , they are awesome !!!<//review>< user>

After more than 10 years this facility . I had highly recommended Pacific Pet Hospital but not anymore. His vet that takes over didn’t give me much of a choice on helping my dog. I pretty much said goodbye seeing her still full of life and you would think I would deserve a call from her (Dr. Humphrey) after numerous messages to call me to answer my doubts so I could understand the decision was the best. I was just told numerous times he was too busy. Honestly I am heartbroken for my loss but more so because after so many years I though a call was the least I deserved  💔<//text>

Everyone is super friendly and nice! They always answer all my questions. When I first got my puppy a little over a year ago, I hopped around different vets until I found this one. A year later.. I'm still here and happy with their services! They have an app, which makes it really easy to schedule appointments and it gives you reminders about your doggy.< /text>

<text>I have had experience with a lot of vets for a lot of animals and I have to see that Pacfic Pet Hospital is the BEST. They have been caring and helpful answering all  my questions and concerns. They were right there during emergencies when I needed them.  The staff and Dr. H have all been VERY good with even my oldest and grumpyist cat. The clinic is spotless ( the first thing I notice in a Vet's office is what it smells like) and their fees are  well within reason. If you need  pet care this is the place to go.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

Dr. Doug Humphrey and his staff take pride in their expertise. I love how Dr. Humphrey takes his time with his patients and is very thorough with everything. He’s preformed surgery on my dog Selma, and has recently treated my new kitten Toulouse. I recommend Pacific Pet Hospital to my family and friends because I trust in Dr. Humphrey and a staff<//text>

<review>I have been taking my dog Koko to Pacific Pet Hospital since I rescued her. The staff is friendly and work great with Koko.
The Dr. Was gentile with her and made her feel at ease from the first touch. I want the best for Koko and I'm very happy that I found this wonderful care for my fur baby.
I whole heartedly recommend,  to anyone seeking great care for their pet. Go visit Pacific Pet Hospital.
The pet desk app is easy to use foe appointments, shot records, and medications.
I thank the Dr's and staff for their caring attitude and love for the job they do.</review></record></dataset><record>

Made an appointment for a bath, exam and flea care for my pet. About 7 minutes passed from when I dropped him off when I got a call from the vet informing me that their scheduling was off and would not be able to complete my service.
This is the second negative incident I've had with PPH. I should not have given them a second chance to screw me over.< /text>

I have brought my kitties to a few different vets in the Eastlake area and have never truly felt comfortable at any of them. I decided to bring my sick cat to Pacific Pet Hospital after reading several reviews. One of the things that swayed me to come here was the fact that they had a dedicated exam room for cats. From the moment we walked inside, I felt welcomed.  Terry saw us first and she was AWESOME!  I could tell how much she loved cats and it really put me at ease.  She explained everything that was going to happen very thoroughly, so by the time Dr. Humphrey saw us, I knew what to expect.  Dr. Humphrey was also very caring and through.  I couldn't be happier! I'm so glad I found them!</text>

< Review>
Wish I can give 10 stars because this place by far the best. Took my chihuahua here because she had an ingrowing hernia and Dr. Humphrey and Terry were absolutely amazing. Very patient and very professional Terry loving and caring with my chihuahua when we visited the first time and the second time when it was time for my dog analyzation if she was going to need the surgery or not. Dr. Humphrey nothing but respects for him he not only analyzed what my Chihuahua had, but also taught me and explained to me what she had so I could be on the same page with him. Explained to me what they were going to do first before they moved on the next step and once they examined my dog well enough, he told me they had to do surgery immediately and he was going to call back after the surgery. Im thankful that he everything went great when he gave me the news that surgery was a success. Definitely recommend this place for those looking for a good vet.<//Review>

I brought my little one here for a post emergency exam after leaving the emergency clinic since she had been hit by a car the night before and one of her eyes was bulging out (Hit and run on a pet IS a crime fyi). The staff treated us like family and my pet almost as their own. You can't teach or train the level of empathy and compassion the doctor and techs show here. I am so moved by that. They are BEYOND forthcoming with information and options you wouldn't even think to ask about and they take care credit. My girl is in surgery getting her eye removed as I type this review and I am free of concern for her well- being because I know she is finally in good hands. I have to mention that my baby wasn't the cleanest given that she was tussled all over the road when she was hit and then laying in dirt when we got her off the street. The DVM and techs didn't seem to even notice her lack of hygiene and held her and pet her like they would any other pet. Although I am heartbroken by what happened to my little one I am equally or even more comforted and grateful for finding this vet clinic. We finally found our home vet!<//text>

This is a fantastic veterinary clinic! . Dr. Humphrues is a very caring and competent. The staff is always very friendly. We have taken several pets there over the past 10 years and have been very pleased with the level of care delivered and received. We like this vet clinic so much we followed them from their Palm Ave location. We highly recommend Pacific Pet Hospital< /text>

Pacific Pet Hospital has the friendliest and most helpful staff; I'm always so pleased with the service they give my pup. Dr. Humphrey is always so patient with my 100 pound, very energetic and playful Pitbull. I'm so grateful they are in my area and I can come to them whenever needed.< /Text>

<Review>I love Pacific Pet Hospital!!  I have been taking my two Puggs there since they were 8 weeks old in 2008.  Dr. Humphrey is our regular veterinarian and he is fantastic!  In fact, the entire staff is wonderful and very caring.  Whenever I have an issue with one of my dogs, I can almost always get an appointment with Dr. Humphrey the same day that I call.  I REALLY like that.  And, I also really like the Pet Discount Program offered by Pacific Pet Hospital.  It helps spread the cost of the annual stuff (exam, blood and fecal tests, vaccinations, etc.) over the course of a year.  I highly recommend Pacific Pet Hospital to anyone who loves their pet and wants quality health care for that pet.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80d94ee4bfaf2d1b:0x7ca866a22da04ee0< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<review>I have taken my animals to Dr. Upton and Staff for almost 30 years which says it all.  They are a very professional staff whose knowledge is second to none.  One of the best things about them is you can call out of the blue with any old question and they immediately help you!</review><Time>1554421771626</Time><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

<text>The best vet experience i have ever had.i have a  rescue  who is terrified  of men and yet  within 10 minutes  Dr. Humphry won her over.
Their care is centered  around the dogs.
He performed  an exam on her while staying on the  floor for her comfort.  and every visit  he makes sure thg at she is completely  comfortable  before  he starts his exams.
The support  staff is nothing short of amazing.
my dogs looks forward  to going to the vet  which i have never said before.
we love this place
and the prices cant be beat.
i have never felt forced to  drop unnecessary money!</text>< Pics>

<Text>I've been going to a vet in San Diego for more than 40 years.  It was a long distance to drive, but I thought it was worth it.  A neighbor gave me a 5-day-old pup to raise and said Pacific Pet was the hospital she recommended.  I was surprised to find that their prices here were about half of what I had been paying and I absolutely could not find any fault with their service.  Each person there seemed caring and efficient.  While waiting there, I met two women, each of whom ran a dog rescue service.  One woman drives about 20 miles to come here because of the level of service to her rescued dogs.  Both women were expansive in their praise of this facility.  I have actually transferred the care of my older dog to this facility, and so far, am very happy with their service.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d94ee4bfaf2d1b:0x7ca866a22da04ee0</gmap_id></record>

My only complaint at all is that they will take my dog in the back to administer his shots, and I would rather stay with him while this is going on.  He tends to stress when separated from me, and as most pet owners know...he is not a big fan of going to the vet.  I would recommend them for annual exams and routine visits, and will return.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I have two pets, Grace and Jackson. They are small dogs, Terrier mix and Poodle mix. Pacific Pet Hospital has always taken good care of my pets and reminds me in a timely manner when shots and other pet maintenance is required.
We travel quite a bit throughout the United States and Pacific Pet hospital is only a telephone away if we have any problems and need advice.</Review>

<Text>These guys are life savers. Literally. One morning we found a cat in the middle of the road. He adopted us immediately, but he was in bad shape. Basically everything was wrong with him. Upper respiratory infection, worms, eye infection, fleas, lice, etc. He was underweight and lethargic.

If we wouldn't have taken him for treatment, he would have died. Pacific Pet Hospital was able to help him immediately. They put him on an IV with antibiotics and gave us antibiotics to take home. They also took care of the worms, fleas and lice.

We have now had our kitty for 7 years and hope for many more to come. Throughout the years we have trusted Pacific Pet Hospital (formerly Olympic Pet Hospital) with the care of four different animals and we have always been happy with their service and their fair prices.</Text>< Time>

With that being said, Dr. Shexneider is a very professional no stress cat handler. I am thoroughly pleased with the quality of care and compassion she had for my cat, who had an injured eyeball. I received multiple follow-up calls to insure my cat was comfortable considering the extent of her injury. As a mom, this would've have added more stress to my hectic life, but listening to her and seeing the bond form between the two of them, reassured me that I picked a phenomenal animal doctor.<//review><UserId.>108842091812557940211<//UserId.>< response>

Hello, my name is COOKIE, and I am a 12 year old Cocker Spaniel who has been going here since I was one!!  I love this place and they have ALWAYS treated me with love, common sense and a great deal of EXPERTISE!! I've had routine check-ups and surgery. I have always come home a happier, healthier dog. Also, it hasn't caused my family an arm and a leg. The doctors have called my mom and dad several times in the EVENING, just to check on how they and I are both doing!! I'm so glad they show such consideration for my parents, they are so sweet to me!!!< /review>

From the second I walked through the door I felt so welcome and believed that they were doing everything in their power to find out what was wrong with my kitten. They were very open with me the whole time about what they were doing and why and I felt like she was getting the best care. My bill racked up pretty fast but I don't believe I was overcharger or charged more compared to anywhere else I would have gone and they didn't try to sell me on things she didnt need. The nurses and doctors were there for me the whole time and even when delivering bad news they were respectful of my feelings. I doubt I'll ever go anywhere else after a visit like this.

Ok this review is only on my call that I made just moments ago. I called to get a price on putting  my very loved 12 year old pitbull to sleep. I was informed  that there is a 24 dollar examination  fee. I was told couldn't  just walk in and have my dog put down.  Why the hell not? If I wanted to be present  for the procedure  it would be more expensive. Right there I told them that they seem to be in the  business  for making money. Not very compassionate. Seem very greedy. Again  never been there, and I'll never go there. Would you pay  for a tune up on a car that was not driveable? My dog cant walk and is in pain.< /text>

I have been coming here over 25 years. They have taken excellent care of my pets from birth, puppy litters and death. Recently they even took care of my Guinea Pig. I have complete faith in the providers and staff here. Some may say its pricey, but the prices are relative to the problem, so we find it more than reasonable. I will never even consider another office. Jeff and Sue Swett< /Text>

We took our dog to Pacific pet hospital because he had a seizure. Dr. Humphrey suggested blood work and we went ahead and got all the necessary blood work done. It came back that he was anemic and  Dr. Humphrey prescribed medication and told us to come back for another visit and some more blood work. I brought my dog back to do the bloodwork and the Doctor told us to keep him on medication and we did. A few weeks later our dog had trouble breathing and we decided to take him to another animal hospital (Bodhi animal hospital) they requested the medical records from Pacific pet hospital right away and they didn't send them, in the mean time they asked us what medication he was on and what Pacific pet hospital had said. We told them Dr. Humphrey had said he was anemic and something wrong with his heart. The vet was very concerned as to why he had prescribed him that medication knowing something was wrong with his heart. Our baby ended up passing that night in my partners arms. We are so heartbroken about how this all went down. The next day is when Pacific pet hospital decided to finally send his records! I'm so upset with Dr. Humphrey and the staff for being negligent. When visiting Dr. Humphrey he pretty much said sorry it happens. When my partner wrote a review on the Facebook page she was harassed by the receptionist who didn't seem to like the bad review.   They handled this entire situation horribly and I would always get a second opinion and do your own research before trusting the Doctors. I hope this never happens to anyone else!< /Text>

We've taken our cats to this location for over 20 years.  Doctors and assistants have come and gone, but the service and professional courtesy has always been topnotch.  We recommend this facility without reservation.<//Review>

<text>We take all three of our dogs....Sasha Rose, Blondie and Max to Pacific Pet Hospital.  The staff is absolutely the best there is.  I've taken my dogs in for regular visits, shots, micro-chipping, and emergencies and I always know that my dogs are getting the very best expert care from people who truly love and care about animals.

I can't thank them enough for how well they treat our "kids"!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I have been going to Pacific Pet for over 13 years. Finding a great vet is difficult and once you have one you do not want to change. When I moved 20 miles away I still kept them as my vet. Like I said finding a great vet is difficult.<//Text>

This is the first veterinary facility that I took my three dogs to when I moved to Chula Vista recently. I am so glad I chose them! They take great care of your pets and it's obvious that they genuinely care about their wellbeing. The front desk staff are also very friendly and professional, always.<//Review>

I visited them a few weeks ago because my dogs needed their rabies vaccine for dog tags.  No mention or pressure to purchase more services or things like my previous vet - I love that they just did what I wanted.  I also love the location, parking, and prompt friendly service.<//text>

<Text>Pacific Pet Hospital has been a blessing to our family! We saw them for the first time due to an emergency the day after moving to the area.  They treated us with no complaint even though we got there 30 minutes before closing time on a Friday.  The Vet even called the next day to check on our sweet furdaughter to see how she was recovering.  We now bring both our furkids here and could not be happier!! All the staff is great. They truly get to know you and your pets and explain anything and everything you need to know! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

This is a great veterinary clinic! Dr. Upton is a brilliant diagnostician. Dr. Schexneider is a very caring and competent vet. The staff are always very friendly. We have taken several pets there over the years and have been very pleased with the level of care delivered and received. We like this vet clinic so much we drive all the way from La Mesa to Chula Vista for visits. We cannot recommend Drs. Upton and Schexneider and staff highly enough.</Review>

My story is kind of a long one. Keep reading if your interested. But if you want a quick summary, dr Humphrey and dr upton are the best, their staff at pacific pet hospital are amazing, reliable, they are the only ones I trust with my dogs.  I had a boxer about 25 years ago that I used as a jogging partner/security dog. One day he wasn’t able to walk on his leg....I was fortunate to find dr upton that fixed his leg surgically and we had many many more years of jogging together. Fast forward 25 years later and my large litter of pups had a nasty tail infection. I was so impressed with how quickly they were able to squeeze all of the pups into surgery. I also had one pup,that I thought might be blind.....at my appointment with dr Humphrey he mentioned I might want to observe for hearing loss as well. After we went home I observed this pup more and it turns out she was deaf. The pup found a great home with this knowledge. Dr Humphrey and dr upton have proved time and time again they are the best. I just can’t believe I was so lucky to find dr upton after all these years and now have found dr Humphrey. Their staff is outstanding. I’ve read other reviews that complained about long wait times....I haven’t experienced this. For me, a little wait time is no problem knowing my pets are being seen by the best vets out there. They are not a “drive through” vet office. They take their time with you and your pet.<//review>

<review>A few months ago my roomie & I brought in my PARALYZED 16yr old cat.  I asked the clerk how much it would cost to euthanize him. I can't remember if she said $49 or $64.  We said the cat was 16, & as of that morning, he WOKE UP PARALYZED & in FEAR.  We wanted him to go to KITTY HEAVEN ASAP.  We said he'd had an ongoing disorder that, over a few yrs had gradually diminished his coordination & motor skills, & on that morning, he WOKE UP PARALYZED & SCARED.  We then waited OVER AN HR & A HALF to see the vet. My roomie wanted to be with Kitty Boy when he was put to sleep.  I did not.  I sat in the waiting rm while my roomie went into the exam rm with Kitty Boy to see the vet. I waited & waited. I went to the desk & was told the bill would be OVER $160. When my roomie came out, he said the vet was ADAMANT that he HAD TO do a physical on Kitty Boy before euthanizing him.  Why didn't the clerk honestly state that when I first spoke to her??  Kitty Boy was OBVIOUSLY PARALYZED, & we just wanted him to QUICKLY go to Kitty Heaven. I still remember the FEAR IN HIS EYES.  It was a horrendous, sad day, & our experience at Pacific Pet Hosp. made it a million times worse. To have to wait that long, while we were beside ourselves sitting with our paralyzed, scared, beloved cat... there was no compassion, caring, or sensitivity shown to us by the staff.  It was HELL. And to be charged more than the original quote... that is just WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The city's best restaurant! Good food and a great place to dine, whether you're with family members or friends. Their service is really quick and worth sharing. And also, for the quality and variety of fresh seafood served, this place is very well known. It is an open-air spot, with nearby parking available. Highly advised!</review>

< Review>
This place is such a gym! Their pita bread and all of their sauces are made fresh daily. We loved their appetizers wraps and falafel and steak and chicken. And I love that they have Stubborn brand natural sodas which are delicious flavors. We will definitely be back when in the area - highly recommend it!< /Review>

Not like other places they buy it from kronos. I ordered the pita sandwich with beef in it. They are very far from where I live but if I’ve ever back this place I’d definitely stop by there. And the sauces that they give won’t be enough so ask for more they are vey generous.< /review>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><text>We eat lunch here close to 3 times a week, which says a lot for me. I'm a picky eater that looks to eat 80% of the time healthy. Needless to say, Tahini has great options for someone looking for anything between healthy, hearty, and homely. Prices are super fair and you always feel great afterwards. 10/10</text>< pictures>

Great food and an extremely warm staff. And they're closed on holidays, which I'm a huge fan of.
What's not to like?
(PS--I definitely recommend a chicken pita)</Text>

I can see why this was on the 100 best restaurants in the US. Highly recommend it! Great for the price. Try the chicken shawarma in pita. The pita that they make was delicious, not too doughy or too crisp. The cheese sticks were alright, I don't think I would get them again but that's just a personal opinion. Try the fries!! I will definitely be going back 👌👌</review>

Tahini did not disappoint. I had the chicken bowl with garlic sauce others had steak and chicken Pita. Everyone enjoyed their meal.

The food came out quickly and the restaurant was clean with friendly staff. Can't ask for more. thanks!<//review>

Delicious food! Great service! Good Prices. You can make a pita bread burrito or a rice bowl with your choice of chicken or beef and toppings. We are traveling from out of town and have tried many different middle eastern restaurants in San Diego and this is one of the top-best we’ve tried.<//review>

The place is very clean, friendly staff. I tried the falafel sandwich , the pita bread is freshly baked and very tasty but unfortunately the falafel has no taste and it seems like burned or over fried. The chicken shawarma has no relation to shawarma and even the chicken tastes weird.< /text>

i am in search for the best falafel sandwich in san diego. This is the only thing so far that can even touch the kebab shop (i've seriously tried so many restaurant) The almonds in the sandwich are such a plus. Garlic sauce is a need . 5 stars for a friendly staff and an amazing sandwich! great falafel, and the sandwich doesn't leave my mouth with a garlicky taste which usually happens with this kind of sauce!

Can't get enough of this place.  I typically go for chicken shawarma or falafel, today I tried the chicken shawarma bowl. Tender chicken in a flavorful sriracha tahini and garlic sauce.  A must try,  best middle eastern food in town.  Not to forget,  welcoming environment<//text>

The food here is made pretty quick and you get a decent amount of food for your money. The main entrees are priced pretty good, all around $8-$10. The appetizers are a little pricey for what they are and a fountain drink is $2.50 which is also a little high, but the soft drink selection is really nice with the Stubborn branded natural sodas.<//Text>

<username>Emiliano Rodríguez< /username><Date>1608141359628< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>A fast/casual place that gets pretty crowded at mealtimes. A few tables inside and another few outside, plus a long bar inside. Order at a counter and food is brought to you. The steak and felafel were outstanding, and they give you a choice of one or more types of tahini (e.g., siracha, barbecue). You can have your protein on pita, on a salad, or in a rice bowl. Portions at lunch were good and the prices and staff were terrific! Wish they would open one in Scripps/Mira Mesa!</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>New Update: i came back today just to try again. Bought almost the same order!
The portion was totally different even the chicken shawarma was better than yesterday 👍
For this reason I changed my review to 5 and hopping they will continue providing their customers with the same quality of food 🌟 🌟 🌟🌟🌟

........................................................................

Old review: Delicious food, the reason why i put 3 stars for the portion. It seems very little "less than half bowel".. the attached picture even before start eating.</text>< pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1582305869512, 'text': "Hi Essa. My name is Osama and I am one of the owners at Tahini. Thank you for your review and feedback. We are constantly working to improve our food and hearing back from customers helps us do so. First, I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your food. I do apologize that you felt the portion wasn't enough. We do our best to make sure every rice bowl, salad, and pita sandwich receive the same amount of meat. We do use a larger bowl because we do add your choice of veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickled cucumbers, regular cucumbers, pickled turnips, parsley mix, olives, bell peppers, and pepperoncinis) and sauces on top of the meat for no extra charge. If you don't get any veggies on the bowl we don't add any extra meat or rice. As a result, the bowl can be filled halfway when no veggies are ordered.\n\nThat being said, mistakes do happen with portions, and we accept full responsibility for it. As crazy as it sounds we did not start Tahini with the goal of making money. Instead we started it with the goal of serving the food we grew up loving. I would be happy to make this up to you. If you could email me at Osama@tahinistreetfood.com I will take care of the rest!\n\nBest,\nOsama"}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffb6aa4567f7:0xbb9ba0a1dea9a29a<//Gmap_id></record>

Great food. Use to go all the time. After asking multiple times to put extra sauce on my falafel bowls and ending up stuck eating a dry bowl I stopped. Today I gave them another shot and specified again for extra sauce. Currently I'm struggling to eat another dry one. It's good.. just don't leave without a few extra sauce in hand. May need to stick to only walk in. May its a personal preference. Just my two cents.< /text>

The restaurant is okay. Nothing much about it. Customer service is good. Food portion is not enough. Restaurant is clean, food quality is alright, and menu options are limited. Will probably give them another shot later. But maybe when I'm not too hungry. Little expensive compared to the other restaurants around there</text>

< review>
Amazing shwarma!! We had the chicken shwarma pita sandwich (rice or salad bowls also available) with french fries on the side. You can customize your sandwich with anything you want. The are several sauces to select from, we got the Garlic Sauce with Sriracha Tahini (slightly spicy) which added an amazing flavor to the chicken. The falafel was also popular among other guests. The bread was outstanding.
For drinks we got the stubborn soda which is one of our favorite. All for a very reasonable price.
Staff was super friendly , seating is limited  during busy days. Overall it was a great restuarant, next time we visit we will the bowls 😋< /review>

<review>I lived in Chicago and ate at a couple of Mediterranean fast casual concepts. Tahini is the best by far. All the meats are the perfect texture and the combination of rice, veggies, and sauce is perfect. I've been here a bunch of times and they still are able to deliciously surprise me every time.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The staff is extremely friendly, and the flavors are excellent. They will also let you do half/half on anything (protein&/or style) Highly recommend ALL the house-made sauces, although the cucumber yogurt is my favorite.

Their soft drinks are all stubborn soda flavors, and they recently extended their hours to include dinner!<//Review></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>The hours of this place make it difficult to try on weekends.  But we finally had the opportunity to try this gem of a restaurant today!

We were hesitant to try the falafel since they can be hit or miss in many San Diego restaurants.  This blew me away.  They're not fried until ordered and they tasted amazing, a hint of dill as the base made it fresh.  They use a healthy portion of a house garlic sauce for their bowls and shwarmas that really made the meal shine.

The chicken shwarma was one of the best I've ever tried, while not extremely traditional it was amazing.  The pita bread was freshly made and fluffy.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPanOmtVC51EOXE75EzoWipSaNWSKkG9wTq-gas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJvNVE2SqXJXD9nQ77KZ1aim4CKjt1TWFEgI11=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7aV_ZyA4jUVzy7cqOXBPUzi6LLOuhobqWj4uY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDtwJ0CxHDCQYUasFMTw9PtFaw4rnmKsxqeyQK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT76Yn8pgiMq8Hi7LOkdisu4neFFthCulrs5gI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObftaygZjFpNNfEAwODePa1zJP-sCmlmqkNqpa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

This place doesn’t require you wear a mask.  😡🤷🏻‍♂️. We were ordering at the kiosk and there was a man in a work out shirt and a girl who were ordering with the person behind the plexiglass.  The guy kept leaning around the plexiglass to talk to her (breathing all over the food) and she never said anything to him.  The food is good here but we just left. No thanks.

They need to in force the mandate. It even says in their front door but why if they’re not going to enforce it.< /Text>

We have instituted many additional safety protocols to make sure you and our staff are kept safe when ordering from us. From introducing the self ordering kiosk, checking staff temperatures and more. I do apologize for this latest interaction. Wearing a mask is something we take seriously and our staff is aware that customers must wear a face covering upon entering. Unfortunately, many people still do not take the need to wear a mask seriously in our society and have put staff in confrontational situations. In the past, we have asked customers who were not wearing a mask to leave. However, mistakes do happen and we dropped the ball on this incident. I’ve already reached out to our management team about this. I would appreciate learning more about this situation and also finding a way to make this up to you.

< Review>
I was on a trip from NJ to San Diego and one of my friends suggested this place. I was very hesitant to go because NJ has some of the best Shawarma places in the US. After fighting with him, I ended up going there and maaaaaan, I am so glad I went. This is hands down the top Shawarma spot for me. The crew is super friendly and awesome, the store is ridiculously clean, and it has a very modern look with a Middle Eastern touch which makes it a great atmosphere to eat in. And most importantly, the quality of the food was superb; fresh, tasty, and perfect portions of sauces and veggies with the meat and rice. I had a mixed (chicken & steak) bowl with BBQ Tahini sauce, rice and veggies and it was super scrumptious. Their freshly made pita bread is incredible. I highly recommend that place to anyone who never tried Shawarma before and those who think they've had good Shawarma before. And I was a very surprised by the price which as very affordable for this quality of the food.

I would give this place a 7 Star rating.</Review>

<review>3.5 stars. So I'm not sure why people are raving about this place. The food was good but not out of the world.

My friend and I came here on a weekday night. Cute place with decent sized seating available. You can choose a bowl or pita pocket and then add whatever else you want. She ordered the chicken shawarma pita pocket, I ordered the bowl with veggies. I don't remember which tahini sauce she took but I asked for all, which I then mixed and matched into the rice bowl. Don't get me wrong - I liked the food. But I just don't know why they have 4.5 stars on Yelp and 4.7 on Google. The bowl and pita were filling and after mixing all the sauces flavorful enough for me. And surprisingly filling considering it didn't look like a lot when we started eating.

Now the falafel was a completely different story. It's the best I've ever had! The outside was crusty and crunchy, the inside soft and tasty. With the hummus, it was a delight to have and I will come back here for it again and again.< /review>< date>

Hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. And thats saying a lot considering there are so many different types of sandwiches. Incredible and explosive flavors and so many different ingredients put into a freshly made pita (pita made in house!) that makes this the best sandwich I've ever had. As I was walking out I saw that most people were eating bowls that looked incredible, I started to regret my decision until I took the first bite lol. Which reminds me.... you know the chef has something i like to call "tastations"
Its when he/she considers every bite of the sandwich from beginning to end. And they've got it. The thing was stuffed to the rim with all the ingredients in every bite. Unlike MOST places where the first 1 0r 2 bites are all bread, the first bite was just like the middle! And the bottom of this pita pocket from heaven, ohhh the bottom! The juices the meat the pickles parsley, garlic sauce, onions, cucumbers, 🍅,  and spices all marnenade at the bottom.... ooooweee! I had a mouthgasam. I've been to a lot of places all over the world. This places is a gem in an unlikely location. This is one of those places you'd drive an hour for.</text>

<time>1569636954557<//time><rate>4<//rate><text>This place is quite popular. We wanted a change from tacos and italian food on our trip and this place had raving reviews. We went on a Monday afternoon and we couldn't get a table they were already packed. I can see why its so popular specially for lunch, its an option which is quick, somewhat healthy and quite tasty!

We got their chicken shawarma bowl and falafels on the side. The staff is really well trained and they are super nice. When we told them its our first time there they took the time to explain the whole menu to us! I love the fact that you can choose from sauces and toppings. I got my bowl with the standard garlic sauce and my husband got his with the Sriracha one(btw if you like your food spicy, highly recommend this sauce). The food was really fresh and tasty. They make their meat, breads in house and they taste super fresh. The chicken was flavorful, rice was perfectly fluffy. I really like the texture of their falafels but did not love the flavor.

I nice quick option if you are in the area. Its one of the better shawarma bowls I have had!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Lovely spot for fresh Mediterranean food. Offers salads, rice bowls, or pitas paired with falafel, chicken or steak shawarma. Salad depicted here. Lots of fresh toppings available, feta and almonds extra. Variety of tahini, garlic and yogurt sauces available, staff very friendly and included as many as I wanted. Steak shawarma a little on the lean side, probably healthier rather than tender so I'll forgive it. Falafel here is really where it's at. Fresh, green, bursting with earthy flavor and made from scratch (vegan). Side dishes available include loaded fries, cucumber salad and halloumi. Gourmet soda bar if you're feeling a treat. Would definitely go again.<//Review>< pics>

After trying about 5 different Mediterranean restaurants here in San Diego Tahini HANDS DOWN has the best quality food BY FAR! The owners and staff are super friendly and yes.. this is my second review on them. It’s just THAT good.</text>

Great Mediterranean food. Good portions on the bowls. Pita's looked a little small but the bowl was great.</review>

Incredible shawarma. Certainly the best I've had in the US - if not ever.
The fresh baked bread is perfect. The french fries in the sandwich are a great touch. The service was friendly and the shop is clearly well run. If I lived in San Diego I'd eat here every day.</review>

Tucked into a strip mall, this restaurant has an amazing selection of incredibly fresh food.  Exceptional falafel and hummus. The pita bread is made fresh and delicious.  Great selection of sauces to top off a salad or a pita sandwich.  Gets busy during lunch hour.  Best part of all the very reasonable price for a meal which is made to order.< /Review>

Wow, what an excellent idea for Mediterranean food!  My wife and I came here, and I got a steak bowl with a mix of different items, that tasted so wonderfully together.  We will definitely come back here, again and again.</Text>

The best middle eastern restaurant in San Diego. Every time we come to San Diego from Phoenix we have to stop here. The flavor profiles are mind blowing. My favorite is the shawarma sandwich. I love those French fries they put in there. Of course the halloumi fries with the fig jam are a must. Also the guys that own this place are so nice!!! You can't beat their customer service!<//review>

<text>Fantastic place for authentic Mediterranean street food. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for something tasty, healthy, and quick. The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, and the ambiance was welcoming. It's a fun place to come and just kick it. The steak shawarma was juicy and delicious, and the vegetables were all fresh and crisp. The tahini sauce is nice and thick. You can tell they put love and effort into their sauce as the tahini you find in prepackaged bottles is much thinner and oily. Not here. Some of the best tahini sauce I've ever had. I came all the way from Claremont to try this place out because of all the good things I've heard. I was not disappointed. Will definitely be coming back here again. It earns my highest recommendation!< /text>< Pictures>

Tahini is a fast casual, healthy mediterranean restaurant full of friendly faces. The falafel sandwich is really good here. I don't usually order falafel, but they make their own. Wow, was it yummy. I will go out of my way to come here again and try other tasty treats! The fine print: the lines can be long, and the food (including the pita) is made fresh, so it may take some extra time for your order to come up. While you're waiting, you'll have time to make a new friend.<//text>

<Review>I do love the food here and the staff is always very friendly. 5 stars on that front. But the wait is typically horrible. 20-25 minutes for a simple falafel bowl when it wasn’t even that busy. It’s happened a few times but maybe I have just been unlucky. I’ll try again and hope they have streamlined the service.< /Review>< pics>

We fry our falafel fresh upon order so it does take a few extra minutes for those orders, but a 20-25 minute wait after ordering is simply unacceptable on our part. Mistakes do happen at times, and we hope you'll stop by again so we can make it up to you with a Falafel rice bowl on the house!"}</Resp>< gmapID>

After eating at many Mediterranean places, Tahini has got to be the best in San Diego for amazing food! Their plates are large and will fill you pretty well. Not to mention that their food has so much flavor and you can taste the many years experience. Anytime I’m in Clairemont, i make sure to stop by and get a Falafel bowl and my husband loves getting the Shawarma bowl. Needless to say, we absolutely love this places and hope it stay in San Diego for year to come. Thanks to the Tahini team for proving such incredibly delicious food.</text>

< review>
From my first visit right after they opened to now, I have been in love with this restaurant.  I have tried many items, bowls, pita's, salads, hummus, and the amazing fried cheese with fig jam.

My favorite item is the homemade warm, soft, fluffy, pita bread with the amazing garlic sauce.  Honestly I could eat that as a meal by itself (and I have).  I also love the steak shawarma salad.  I appreciate that I can add and subtract any of their fresh ingredients to make a custom salad the way I like.  I can even opt for no dressing and get a couple of their sauces to use as my dressing.  Of all the items I've tried, nothing has disappointed.  I continually crave this amazing food.

The service has never been anything but impeccable.  The employees are extremely friendly and inviting.  My order is always made perfectly, even will all of my modifications.    I have brought multiple co-workers here and it's now some of their favorite spots.  If you are looking for a wonderful, fresh, tasty meal, look no further.< /review>

*Updating with an extra star since the owner reached out with a positive attitude to make it right and really values the customer experience. Looking forward to trying this place out when I'm back in San Diego again!

Upon entering, we were greeted by the friendly staff who explained our food options which were also posted up on the wall. The menu was easy to read and they offer rice bowls with salad and meat or in a freshly baked pita bread. We decided to order the Shawarma bowls since I'm not a huge steak or falafel fan. We also got a half order of the Tahini fries and Halloumi cheese sticks. For our sauces we got the garlic sauce, siracha sauce, and cilantro tahini on the side. Our food came out pretty fast within 10mins but our bowls were barely full with a handful of basmati rice hiding at the bottom with a few slices of shredded chicken added in and covered up by lots of lettuce on the top with a drizzle of sauce. There was no flavor and I found the food to be quite bland overall. Also the garlic sauce had more of a mayonnaise paste consistency rather then being saucy so just beware. The cilantro Tahini offered the most flavor out of all the sauces. The half order of fries also came out with less fries and more toppings of the olives, feta cheese and pepperonicins which was surprising since fries are usually cheaper so they should offer more instead of the toppings. My friend enjoyed the Halloumi sticks which came out with some pita bread and jam. I tried the pita bread which was freshly baked but again didn't have the tasty bread flavor to want you to keep on eating it.

I came here based on a friends recommendation and was honestly a bit disappointed. This place reminded me of the many lunch spots in NY offering mediocre Shawarma bowls. The concept is cool for a lunch spot but the flavors are just not there for me to want to come back.

Parking:
Plenty of parking available out front in the plaza and outdoor seating is available as well.</Review>

So, I generally end up going to little places like this to avoid that issue. I found tahinis on a Google search and it looked like it has some good reviews so I decided to give it a try. The location is a little small and it was crowded when I went in That's generally considered a good sign by me. I had the chicken shawarma in a pita, they had really great flavors. I wasn't all that hungry so I didn't try anything else but they had some great sodas as well.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Awesome  taste experience.  Best Middle Eastern food I have had in ages.  Freshly made,  had a large and delicious Shawarma on Pita sandwich, fast and friendly service and nice décor and nice ambiance.  If you are in the Clairemont Mesa area this is definitely an outstanding choice for a memorable meal.<//review>

< Review>
Went in there at 11 am,  placed an order.  People that ordered their food after  me got it  really quick (like in  5 mins). Asked what was going on they told me that my fries wasn't ready....... 30 mins on fries. I got my food at 11:30 . Both of what I ordered  was cold when I ate it. They told me they would compensate me , never did.  Not going back.</Review>

{'time': 1560290424358, 'text': 'Hi, we really apologize about this morning, unfortunately we had a issue with the fryers and management weren’t aware of the fryer situation until we opened. I personally compensated the orders today who had fried items on their order. Sometimes it takes a day or two to show on your online banking. However, if you didn’t get compensated please let me know. Anyone who got their food before you must have had nothing fried on their order. We normally staff a minimum of 12 employees during lunch in order to have a seamless experience which I know didn’t happen today but we really do care about our customer experience. If youre willing to give us another shot I would be really happy to make things right, otherwise we really do appreciate your feedback about your experience as we try hard to give everyone the best experience.

All the recipes are well thought out and it's evident that the owners are dedicated to ensuring the flavors are authentically Middle Eastern.

Although the food is very enjoyable, the aspect that I feel most happy supporting is their mission of quality service and sustainability. I appreciate that the beef is free range and the owners actively seek to minimize waste. I recommend having a chat with any of Tahini's employees as they will proudly state that Tahini is involved in a number of programs dedicated to give back to the community. Therefore, I believe it's a vegan friendly place not only for its food, but for its willingness and commitment to supporting the community and environment.</Text>< pictures>

The meat is alpastor style and is very juicy, pita is baked right out the oven and veggies were fresh as can be. This place is delicious. Well deserved 5 stars.<//text>

Awesome fast casual Mediterranean spot with fantastic service and tasty fresh ingredients. The pita is baked fresh and the guys behind the counter were so friendly, welcome and accommodating. On top of that the space is clean and pleasantly designed. Parking is difficult during peak hours though.<//text>

<Text>Love the concept of their menu. Pick a bowl, salad or pita the type of protein you want and then the toppings. I had a basic beef pita (kebab) with Sriracha  tahini and feta. The pita’s are fresh made in house, meat is tender and delicious and they don’t skimp on loading up the pita. Also ordered halumi cheese sticks. They came with fig jam cilantro tahini and we’re delicious! Staff was also very polite and restaurant was spotless!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Well, that was a short lived romance...our building is around the corner from Tahini and so I told everyone I work with about this place from the second they opened. Many of us would come here 3 or 4 days a week for lunch.
The food is great and we love the concept.
But recently they had gotten busier and so they are unaccomodating with phone orders now, a bit rushed and rude on the phone, portion sizes decreased yet prices increased. I heard about this from my manager, and saw it myself today on the 3 orders before me that had bowls.

The food quality hasnt changed, its still delicious...but when I have to now pay $14 for the exact same order that I used to pay $11, and the portion is smaller, its time to say goodbye.

Coworkers are feeling the same. Thats a bummer!

My suggestion is to either to get those bowls filled up again, or bring down your prices to what they were. You have plenty of business going. But most people dont pay $14 for lunch with all the other options around the area. Being there 3 days a week for lunch was costing me $50. Maybe offer some kind of frequent customer discount or something at least, and we will return</text>

{'time': 1561158217561, 'text': 'Hi Melissa,\n\nThanks for your review. We take customer feedback very seriously.\n\nFirst and foremost, I do apologize that you feel that the portion sizes have gotten smaller. Since opening our doors back in 2017 we have kept the same portion sizes. For all of our pitas, rice bowls, and salads we use roughly 5oz of cooked chicken or steak shawarma. For the veggie toppings we try to keep an even balance on the ratio of protein to veggies, and if you ever want extra veggies we’d be happy to accommodate! That being said, mistakes do happen and I apologize that you felt you got shorted on food.\n\nAs for the price increase, it was a necessary move on our part for three reasons. The first was to take care of the staff that makes your food. As we have gotten busier and hired more staff we knew they had to be taken care of with a living wage. Secondly, we have worked to improve the quality of our ingredients. We have switched to an organic spring mix, we use Angus Choice or higher Tri-Tip beef, make all of our sauces in house and bake our own pita bread. Additionally all of our chicken and steak is certified Halal, meaning it was slaughtered in accordance with stricter guidelines and regulations. Third, we are working to be a completely plastic free facility. All of our plates, lids, utensils, and soda cups are fully biodegradable. We recently also switched our water cups away from plastic. All of this necessitated an increase in price. It was a difficult decision but one that we felt was worth it in the end.\n\nAs for ordering over the phone, I do apologize that you felt rushed or treated rudely. We really do want every one who we interact with to get the best service possible. Since our phone lines get pretty backed up during lunch time we do advise folks to use our online ordering system on www.tahinistreetfood.com. It helps save a ton of time from having to wait in line to pay.\n\nLastly, as crazy as it may sound we aren’t in the business of just making money. We really are committed to making the best possible Middle Eastern street food in the most welcoming environment possible.\n\nFor that reason I’d appreciate you reaching out to me at info@tahinistreetfood.com so that I can make this right for you!\n\nThanks!\nOsama'}<//Resp>

Delicious food and helpful staff. I called in an order from the hospital, and since it was not crazy busy they did their best to separate sauces and have it out right on time to maintain maximum freshness. 5/5. Would come to again and again if I lived close.
We got the chicken and steak shawarma and shawarma fries with steak.<//text>

Amazing. When will this place be a chain?! Send it to the IE (Riverside) or somewhere close to there. Great food. Excellent service. Highly recommend the chicken shawarma bowl or the tahini fries!!! Love the presentation of the food in a bowl!!! Ask for extra garlic sauce on the side (you'll thank me later). Even the falafels are great! (And I'm picky about my falafels) We will definitely be back next time we are in SD. Only bummer is the fountain soda selection. I'm not a big soda fan (I prefer non carbonated beverages)  but if u are into cream sodas this is the place to get them!</review>

I ate Chicken Shawarma with Tahini Sauce(Signature sesame seed based sauce)

It was tasty because of marinated chicken, garlic and sesame sauce.

Good pita, good haloumi. Didn't love it over rice, but that was our fault for picking something that would be easier to share with the kids. Falafel and steak were both tasty and the service was very friendly too.<//Review>

$7.50 for a large falafel pita with numerous sauces and also veggies in it. I plan on ordering the falafel rice dish following time I go in, with a side of pita and hummus. Falafel is most definitely hit or miss depending on the place but the falafel here was homemade as well as fried to get ... sooo delicious!! In my pita pocket I additionally got onion, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, pickles, cilantro tahini sauce as well as garlic sauce.< /Text>

Someone called this chipotle style, and while it really is the way you order is a bit different, however the staff is very friendly in helping you understand the menu. The food itself is amazing. Like the TKS while they were still good!</text>

Really enjoyed the tahini sauces, the option of making wrap, bowl or in pita and all the topics that you can add. The meat are ok, kinda dry, the other stuff made up for it so I would definitely come back. Good portion too. They food Tahini fries!!! And bowls!

Food is by far the best Mediterranean I had since living in San diego. Staff is friendly and attentive and helps if you don't know how to decide. Try the chicken salad, it's amazing! Always stop there for food when close by, absolutely my favorite place to go to for falafel, hummus and shawarma.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

If you are a fan of tahini sauces, then this is the place for you. They have a variety of sauces you can choose from. The food was fresh and sauces were all distinct. We ordered the chicken wrap (doner kebab style), and gyro rice bowl along with their fries bowl. The meats were tender and flavorful, but they only have options of pickled or raw onions. Definitely should have gone with raw. The fries bowl, had a little too much going on so couldn't really enjoy it as much. Make sure to try the bbq, and sriracha tahinis. Inside the place was clean and modern looking. Definitely worth a visit.< /text>

<review>Very friendly owners!  They used to have a food stall in Pacific Beach and graduated to a nice restaurant in clairmont.  Their bread (pita) is baked fresh and is very yummy.  Their felafel is cooked well and tasty, with a big hint of dill.  The loaded fries are good and filling (and don't make you feel too bad about yourself because it does have veggies).  The bowls are nice and healthy as well.  Overall a great little start!!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Food was good and fresh and service was good too but quite disappointed with the quantity of meat in the dishes.  Both chicken shwarema bowl and steak shwarema wrap had so little meat that we were fishing for the meat pieces and kept thinking where is the meat.  I would highly recommend they increase quantity of meat as shwarema is all about the meat.< /text><time>1552787508784< /time><user_id>113585642241239632610< /user_id>< name>

<text>Place never fails to amaze. The falafel is so creamy compared to other places and has that Mediterranean zest that any true fans needs in there life. Don't forget the free addons my favorite is the pickled radish. I just wish that I wasn't always having a work lunch there so I could bring a camera and do them justice. I have yet to have the meat but if the falafel is good the meat should not be far off.  Tip of a hat to the service there and the best music in town.< /text>< Pics>

Tahini is great, the place is clean, the lines usually move quick, the service is friendly, and they have healthy shawerma salads that are filling and taste amazing.  Lastly the prices are comparable to other places that Two thumbs for Tahini!<//Text>

This is my new go-to restaurant.  The food is out of this world and the staff are over the moon in ensuring you are more than satisfied with their food and service. You have to try this place if you like Mediterranean-Middle Eastern cuisine!!! I wish I could give them more stars.  Try the take on carne asada fries with their Mediterranean fries.  OMG!< /Review>

We’ve tried shawarma in different parts of US. This is by far the best shawarma we had. The beef and chicken is so tender, that it melts in the mouth. Fresh ingredients and excellent customer service!!<//review>

Finally, real green Egyptian style falafel! Not those yellow hockey pucks that other places serve. The Sahwerma meat quality was almost too good to serve as shawerma. Tasted like I was eating filet mignon! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. How do I invest? :-)</Text>

<Review>It's clear they take pride in the quality of their food! We had the falafel bowl and tried quiet a few of the sauces, all amazing! One surprising standout is the BBQ tahini sauce, I wasn't convinced when it was suggested and it became my favorite. The falafel was delicious, made to order, and made with Fava beans - so tasty! And the pita bread was so soft, warm, and had great flavor! Not to mention everyone there was welcoming and helpful. Easily brought me back to flavors of Turkey and Greece when I visited, definitely will be back!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<review>A new local favorite for me. If they delivered I'd probably have this multiple times a week. Love the simplicity, yet still have such variety with all the add ons. Siracha and bbq tahini are amazing. The garlic is potent and delicious, and it's hard to pass up fresh pita.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Great spot for Middle Eastern comfort food! I have been to spots all around the Middle East and their falafol and swarma are the BOMB!  The cumato salad is awesome as well as the hummus! Both myself and my wife found a definate new place to revisit!<//Review>

<Response>{'time': 1552507846340, 'text': "Hey Marwan. Thanks for your review. We really do value customer feedback. I'm sorry to hear that your sandwich didn't feel full with meat. We do use portion spoons to make sure each meal, whether a pita, rice bowl, or salad has roughly 5 ounces of cooked Chicken or Steak Shawarma. That being said, mistakes do happen. We would love the opportunity to make it up to you with a sandwich on the house. Feel free to reach out to us at info@tahinistreetfood.com if you have any questions. Otherwise we hope to see you again soon!"}<//Response>< pics>

We do our best to make sure all of our meals have a good portion size, and more importantly that all of our meals, whether a pita, rice bowl, or salad have the same portion sizes. Our customers have been giving us feedback that the size of our meals are filling. As for our prices, we use the highest quality ingredients we can find, including grass-fed halal beef and antibiotic free halal chicken. All of that being said, mistakes do happen and it might have been you didn't get the proper portion sizes. We hope you'll come back in again and would love to make you another meal on the house!"}< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dbffb6aa4567f7:0xbb9ba0a1dea9a29a</gmap_id></record>

< review>
Hi everyone! Loved this place so much I had to tell you! ( and everyone I've had even minor contact with for the last 2 days😅) I went vegan a while ago so I found them using the happy cow app and they did not disappoint! They also have plenty of vegeterian options and good ol' fashioned chicken and steak dishes. I would say it's elevated middle eastern street food, and it's seriously delicious! They make the best falafel I have probably EVAH had! (seriously, break one open and smell it!) My husband tried their steak and is also in love, high quality beef, very well prepared. Their tahini is amazing and has a bunch of different flavors: reg, sriracha, bbq and more! And, most importantly, the food quality is on point; basically EVERYTHING is made from fresh ingredients in house, you name it: the falafel is made from fresh beans, no cans, powders or fillers (eggs or dairy!😃); they make their own bread from scratch, and OMG can your mouth tell the difference! Their soda (both fountain and bottled) is delish, made with real sugar and comes in a lot of super tasty, interesting flavors! (Try the cherry with tarragon, you'll thank me) I have been there 3 times since finding them 2 days ago, twice on the first day! ( yeah, don't judge me until you go there!😉) The staff is super sweet, accommodating and helpful and you can tell how much they love their place! It is really affordable and for T- town pretty close by, soooo happy to have a great option for V food, and just plain awesome food, down the street a bit. Go there people, I need this place to stay open forever, ( tho I dont think they'll have ANY trouble) make your taste buds happy and be sure to tip the hands that feed ya 🙄.</review>

We are constantly working to improve our food and hearing back from customers helps us do so. I do apologize that your visit to Tahini didn't live up to expectations. As crazy as it sounds we did not start Tahini with the goal of making money. Instead we started it with the goal of serving the food we grew up loving. When we fail to live up to that mission, we find it necessary to make it up to you.\n\nI'd love to hear from you and find a way to make this up to you. If you could reach out to me at Osama@tahinistreetfood.com I will take care of the rest!\n\nBest,\nOsama"}< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dbffb6aa4567f7:0xbb9ba0a1dea9a29a</gmapID></record>
