<rating>1<//rating><Text>This place is good, for only oil changes. I don’t understand how an experienced knowledgeable owner of an auto shop wouldn’t know what is wrong with my vehicle and this loud noise it was constantly making. It’s embarrassing on his part for not knowing or taking the time out to look for the problem since that’s what auto shops do.. But I took my car to another shop, 400$ got my problem fixed. They did not mind spending time to let me know what is really wrong with my truck and got me good quality parts. Now the noise is completely gone. Better luck next time guys :)

Update: and the noise was not caused by the break pads, the break pads are in great condition. It was the back 2 rotors that needed to be resurfaced or changed. Which I got them changed, brand new no sound thank you :)<//Text>< pics>

Beware of scams and what they do to your vehicle. I took my car in for a/c service and they charged me $100 for labor but couldn't even find the cause so they wanted me to pay another $160 to find out what's wrong with it. I said no and when I took the car back the plugs weren't even plugged in for the radiator fans. I took my car to do ac service at Mobile 1 and they're the most honest and cool shop showed me what was the problem and they didnt even charge me extra for what was wrong with my ac. Got it fixed faster than this place in 1hr and they're able to do it on the same day i called, while this place will take 1-2 days to try to fix on top of that 1 week schedule to take your car in.< /review>

Took in my 14 Accord for a couple things and we’re able to get all of them address! Luis did a great job explaining the check engine light code diagnostic process every step of the way. They were able to clear the 2 codes present and get rid of the light. They were also able to pin point a popping noise from the suspension and repair it! Straight forward honest work and great technicians in the back as well.< /review>

<Review>I dont want to bash this company too hard but I didnt have a great experience. The receptionist was helpful, professional, and kind. Staff generally were kind and tried to be helpful but the cost caught me off guard. Went in with a honda element that had an Eva leak and I had already replaced the gas cap, checked the fuel filler neck, and checked into the fuel hoses. I know it leaked gas if I filled the tank too far so assumed it was something I couldnt find in the lines or the tank itself. $160 to look at it and initially I was plenty okay with that. Thats a fair enough price for how quick they got me in. But then I got a text saying they thought it may have been an issue with the fuel tank along with a photo. They said they would call but half an hour later..no call. I called and got a message that the mobile user couldnt be reached at that time. I called again a few min later and was told it would be $200 for "teir 2 diagnostics" because they needed to take the tank out and check it sepwrately. $200 to look at a part? Seems a bit much for me. I came to get my car and paid the $160 and will be taking it to A&A auto repair where they assured me that for $95 they would pinpoint the issue and discuss repair options with me before moving forward. And just to clarify, the $200 was to look at the part. Not fix or replace it. That would cost more. So $360 to figure out the problem all together. Very frustrating. Maybe I just dont understand something about my car or how expensive mechanics can be but to me it seems like a lot and they didnt really reassure me that it was necessary or make me feel very comfortable about it.  I know its a long read but I hope it helps someone sometime.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I called in to see if I could take in my car for new brakes and they were able to accommodate me the same afternoon! I called various shops for estimates and Romita Auto Serv. was able to get me the best deal. Upon arrival, Luis explained to me what exactly was getting done to my Lexus and he was able to get it to me before they closed. He was very professional and I’m so glad I went with his recommendation because my car drives better than it did before I took it in!< /review>

I had been trying to get my car fixed at numerous shops across town. Other shops wanted $300+ just to run simple diagnostics. I ended up getting my issue solved today for less than $400 total. My wait wasn’t long, the work was quick and everyone was friendly. I will definitely be coming back again for future car services. Thank you! :)< /Review>

I can now say I have found an auto repair company I can trust. I found this company of Yelp and decided to give it a try after all the great reviews I read. Before coming I chatted with Nestor on Yelp for a quote and once arriving he greeted me promptly with great professionalism. They really do make you feel welcome and give you assurance that your car is in good hands. I was kept updated with any repairs my car needed and their team proceeded to fix them only with my approval and after giving me an exact cost. They started the work on my car super quick and had me out in no time. I also appreciate them showing me pictures of everything that was done to my car. A very honest and genuine company who truly cares to provide the best service to their customers! I never knew what my car was suppose to feel while driving before coming here! I feel extremely safe in my car now! Thank you again Nestor and all the staff!< /Review>

This place is AMAZING from prices to employees, they truly know how to take care of their customers like family. They took my car in and gave me an ASTOUNDING UNBEATABLE offer and ever since I haven't put my car in any other shop. Trust worthy and helpful to the fullest they always leave me 100% satisfied from leaving it there to when I receive my car back.
They keep me at ease by showing me updates on my car with pictures and a full detailed description on whats wrong with the insides. They help me better understand what they are doing, instead of confusing me like other places might do.
I LOVE the employees welcoming energy, the girls at the front are always a joy to talk to and they always treat me like family.! Romita is the PLACE TO GO.!

I dont have any issue with the alternator atm but I do get 5 year warranty for the part.

After they replaced the alternator my car start to have rattle noise when I start the car and it will stop once it warm up.  At first I thought that it probably normal cause I just got my car fix but it still doing it everyday that I will have to take it to somewhere else n get it fix.

Took my car in to get the air-conditioning serviced.  Unfortunately something was still wrong. Janeth worked with the warranty company in order to resolve the issue my car was having. They are always friendly and work on your car until  they fix the problem.</text>

<review>Excellent service at an affordable price and always friendly staff! I have been taking my vehicles to Romita since 2000 when the shop was located on East Belmont Ave. Even though the size and level of technology of the shop has changed, the quality of service and the compassionate nature of Nestor, Francisco and all the other employees remain the top reason why I go to the shop. Thanks!< /review>< pictures>

Awesome experience! Great price! Everyone was friendly and i was even given a lift home. Messaged when repair was done, which was way faster than i had anticipated. Definitely recommend.<//Review>

I drop off my Toyota for a wheel bearing replacement for both sides, and it was ready the next day.  It runs like new again.  The receptionist who checked me in was very friendly and the young girl who checked me out was even better. She had a wonderful smile and made me feel welcome. The mechanics were also very friendly and knowledgeable.  Definitely Will return as needed. This was my first 1st time here and I highly recommend it.</review>

Romita Auto Service has excellent technicians, they have done plenty repairs on my vehicle from doing electrical repairs, mechanical work to diagnosing the check engine light and pin pointing the problem. I am satisfied with the work they have done with my vehicle and I have not had any issues with the previous repairs. If you guys are looking for trust worthy technicians, I highly recommend this place.< /review>

Fixed leaks on my car, and found out what the issue was that was causing my car to overheat. With a lower price then what Midas charged me (426$)  that did nothing for my car and didn't even need to be replaced, if you don't want a guessing game i suggest go here, they will let you know what's wrong. I would reccomend this place, and take any future cars here first< /text>

Honest mechanics, they always do a great job on our vehicles. Have been going to them for over 10years. Have taken them cars from Toyota to BMW. We've saved thousands especially with BMW. Won't go anywhere else.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>The lady was nice at the front desk and wasn't rude. I asked before hand if they were going to be open New Years Eve. She asked the mechanic he said yes therefore I made an appt at 8 am. They dont even deserve a star. I made an appt.  And they didn't even show up.  Why make appts for your customers if you cant keep them. I was actually recommended to this place. I will never recommend them to anyone! Some people may have had a good experience and gave it a good rating. But as for myself I was not happy. I waited in hopes they were running a little late, but nothing. Dont make appts you cant keep!</review>< pictures>

Hotel was very loud being next to the CA25 highway.  Room wasn't horrible but does need some TLC and maintenance. Beds are very stiff.  There was a lot of people outside drinking and being loud.  This being in a farm town area with a lot of contractors and construction workers this makes sense. The hot breakfast was garbage and smelled/looked weird. Property is well lit, has a lot of cameras and I didn't feel unsafe in the area.  If you are going to Pinnacles NP there are not many option on the east side of the park unfortunately... Staff was friendly and helpful.</review>

There were not complete toiletries when we arrived. Asked reception for shampoo and conditioner and was told to go to reception to pick it up.  At reception Manager said he would bring it to the room. He never brought it.
The second day our room didn’t get clean, when I called reception at 6:00 PM, was told that we probably left the “do not disturb sign”.  I said we didn’t and ask them to clean it. Their response was the housekeepers were gone for the day.
When checking out I asked for a discount, the manager said we probably left the “do not disturb sign on.  Again I said we didn’t and explained that a couple from our group checked in and requested a second floor bedroom. They were told that there were no second floor rooms clean.  Manager said the best he could do was to give me some reward points.  Instead of blaming us implying that the “don’t disturb sign”, was left.  He should have apologized and offer a discount.  Our group of 8 doesn’t feel we were treated fairly. We paid for a clean room and were not offered and apology or discount. Our group of 10 doesn’t feel we should go back to the Best Western San Benito Inn. The staff at the dining room and some at reception were friendly.<//Text>

My wife and I played in the beaches around Monterey Bay and booked this place for just one night stay. We arrived the inn late of the night. The mam in the counter was very helpful. The bed was soft and cozy. The room was just a little bit out of date but the sanitary condition was pretty good. We had a sound sleep in the quiet countryside environment. The self-service breakfast was also good. We made some waffles for ourselves. I'd like to advice my friends to experience this place.< /review>

<Review>Really friendly staff and decently modern rooms. Could have used a little more furniture (no sofa or seat), but otherwise nicely set up. Breakfast had more offerings than I expected! Continental normally suggest to me just muffins and pastries and the like, but they had waffles, bacon, sausage, eggs.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>We booked on line once seeing what was available in town knowing what to expect at a Best Western...not this time!  We booked the room on their website so I really don't know how this mixup happened.  Paid for a nonsmoking king room.  When checking in the girl couldn't find our reservation and proceeded to tell us she didn't have a nonsmoking King room, only a smoking King room.  I showed her the conformation email I was sent.  We like the type of room where we can pull our car in front of the room, only a single queen was available.  We wanted to cancel our reservation since it was 3 in the afternoon of the day we made the reservation and no cancellations.  We took the queen bed downstairs where we could park.  Went inside and it reeked of chemicals from cleaning the carpet (or just spraying, not sure).  We go back to the front desk to move upstairs to a room with two queen beds.  This room was no jewel either.  First thing I wanted to do was wash my hands since the front desk girl had a cold.  I wash my hands and grab a hand towel and notice a big yellow spot.  Did I dare smell the towel, I did, then smelled the other hand towel...GROSS the yellow hand towel was dirty!!  I gave my husband the sniff test after asking him to close his eyes.  The towel failed again. Later when we undressed I put on my slippers, walked over to the sink and my slippers stuck to the floor.  My husband didn't bring his so we laid towels on the floor.  That is just nasty!   We wanted to stay in one spot for a few days to check out the area although we are so out of here.  Next place we stay I'm looking at the room before we actually pay.  We paid for a King room on the first floor and received a dirty room on the second floor with only queen bed and no refund for the inconvenience.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>3 stars due to excessive number of flies in the room.  Some of this might not be the hotel's fault due to surrounding farm country, but during 2 night stay, we must have killed a dozen flies.  The room itself seemed very clean, but when you have that many flies, it's hard to overlook.  Other members of our party staying in a different room mentioned excessive road noise, so beware if you are travelling with small children who need to sleep or you are sensitive to road noise.  Staff seemed friendly and accommodating, but the flies . . .<//Text>< Pics>

The service was just excellent at this hotel I would have liked this hotel even better but the noisy environment, it's too close to the highway & roadway. I am a traveling nurse who works night and would have love it more if the surrounding area is quiet!< /Review>

Shortly after that we discovered a pincher bug in the bedding near the pillow. We found a total of two pincher bugs during our one day stay. We also had 2 flys in our room. There were also a number of flies in the breakfast area dining room. The dining area was also small and cramped, there was very little space to accommodate the number of guests seeking breakfast. They also did not refill the foods at the breakfast bar.
One last area of disappointment was the shower. The water did not drain well in the shower in our room.< /Review><name>kenneth thomas</name>< rating>

The bed is comfortable but our supposedly "nonsmoking" room reeked of cigarettes. I opened the door and it was like someone was blowing cigarette smoke right in my face. Also, I went to take a shower and there was a bar of soap woth crusted-on soap and hair all over it. Yuck.</Text>

Best Western in Hollister did a marvelous job for me and 5 employees to facilitate a project in the area. Nicely done to Cindy and Sophie at the front desk.< /text>

Nice hotel it's the Fairmont of Hollister.  No frills, except for the pool and great breakfast!  There's also a grill by the pool which is inviting.  It's supposed to be a no smoking hotel, but the first room we walked into reeked 🙁.  Had to wait a couple hours to get a room cleaned that didn't smell, but this one had a cracked tv screen, it took another 45 minutes to have it replaced 🙁.  After that though the rest of th stay was pleasant.< /review>

<Text>The hotel is dirty. Stayed there 1-10-16 and 1-11-16. Found earwigs  in the room both nights. The upkeep of the rooms is also poor. The website says they have a hot breakfast, but when you show up they say they are remodeling. They have been saying this forever, and there is no sign of remodeling. I would stay somewhere else if there were other options in Hollister.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

On september 2nd my husband in I drove to Hollister for my cousin's wedding. After a long drive that afternoon we decided to go to the hotel and check in, rest a little and change, before going to the reception. When we got to the hotel office the lady told us we couldn't check in yet because the room had not been cleaned so my husband said it was fine that we just needed to change really quick then she ended up saying we couldn't because there was still people in the room we had booked. When I had called a few weeks prior to that date they had told me I could check in at anytime and they weren't letting us do it 😠. They told us we could use the restroom to change and come back later to check in. The next day the cleaning lady knocked on our door, when there was a sign that said do not disturb, and opened the door with no hesitation while I was changing. She didn't seem to care that I was only on my bottom wear and told me us that it was time to check out. Never did she apoligize or look away. That made me so angry and embarrass. I had paid for a day and it hadn't even been 24 hours yet from the time we had checked in to the time they wanted us out. I will never rent a room from them again.</review>

I wish I could have given ZERO STARS! We stay at several Best Westerns as my husband travels for work. They have all been very accomodating and helpful but NOT the Hollister location. We called to book a room and were told they did have rooms available. Upon booking my husband told the clerk we would be using our rewards points and she quickly said "you need to call the 800 #".... Ummm, this is a first. Every other hotel processes it no problem. He hangs up and calls the 800 # who quickly calls the hotel and all of a sudden "We are booked for the night". It was literally not even 2 minutes. This is the last time we will attempt to give Hollister our service, and the worst part.... This is our hometown! You suck! We will continue taking our points and money elsewhere.< /Text>

Stayed here 12/2015. Poorly maintained rooms and property, they could not honor my reservation for a non-smoking room, sent me to two rooms that would not open, none of the climate controls in the room worked and every room smelled like chemicals. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!< /review>

Why say open to the public? It says 10am they show up late, plus all the appointments is b.s. 1 barber shows up and their already 10 people waiting. We waited 2hrs nothing. Can't make appointment with only one barber and 15 people waiting. Very unprofessional.... Do not go there...</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) My husband came there at 9am and he says that there were those who got out there for about 20 minutes and they did not open, I asked what time they would open and one of them answered that he did not know he also said that everyone was drinking beer. Well they say that the first impression is what counts.

(Original)

Bueno dicen que la primera impresión es lo que cuenta.<//text>< Date>

Today February  27,2020, there was a different  cook, plate came out delicious  and looked fresh, from the chicken to the vegetables, rice and orange. I had stop coming to this place bc it's always dried and vegetables  lookes old. Hopefully this place finds more cooks like the one from today.< /review>

Be carful , The cook wasn’t wearing Gloves, she was short with tattoos.
She was cutting up vegetables without gloves and then made some bowls with no gloves , I watched !
She also had a some sort of bandage on her finger 🤮.
Come on guys. Not coming here again.< /Review>

No burnts at all but the amount of soy sauce still ruins everything. Please stick with your corporate taste. This is just pure torture for my blood pressure.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Do not shop here!!!  They have no standards on how to treat their customers!!!

I have worked retail for 11 years in my teens to mid twenties 40 hours a week and being a full time student in a low income family so I understand the hardship of working a minimum job and frustration.  But the way I was treated here is the reason people have such a low respect for people with jobs like this.  The cashier ignored me when I walked in and to her register,  when I said hello, and for 3-5 minutes (no joke)  of me standing in front of her as she talked to the cooks in the kitchen she just kept ignoring my existance.  After that she still did not return my greetings and just asked: "what do you want?" like I'm wasting her time or something...
I don't think she was having a bad day either,  considering she was joking around with the cooks as I stood in front of her for 5 MINUTES!!!

I will never shop here and neither should anyone else until they expect much more from their workers.

Also the chicken was an over-cooked rubber. What kind of cook over cooked a simple chicken...</Text></record></dataset><record>

Giving a good rating to counter all the obviously retarded people making reviews. I come here regularly and have never had a bad experience. Don't expect a healthier eating option to be as cheap as MacDonald's.<//review>

This place is terrible. I ordered a regular chicken bowl, brown rice, veggies... no joke, about 3/4's of the bowl was soggy brown rice. The little chicken I did get was terrible, felt like I was eating rubber! I should have read the reviews for this place before I went. Terrible! Stay away! Trust me.<//review>

I've been to many flame broiler before. This one smelled funny. I have my meal I always order the same thing .  So asked for no veggies instead could I more rice. She said yes. I got my food half the bowl of rice and no veggies.  I went to ask the worker she said we can't do that.  I'm like okay. Thanks for ripping me off. Never going back to that flame broiler again. Also I felt like she was rushing me like was a inconvenience for her. Terrible customer service.</review>

I called ahead for 20 minutes and they ignored my call. When I got there I ordered my bowl and called from the line and watched them ignore the phone. Then they told me there would be a wait for white meat. Took the cook 10 minutes to start my bowl and there was no one else (zero people) in the place while this all took place.</Review>

<text>I have always had good service here. Employees are attentive and answer any questions you may have. Never had an issue and have been going to this particular T-Mobile for years now.
The area does get crowded at times since it is located next to a Starbucks. I recommend going to this store in the early morning for the best experience.</text>< Rate>

Before I went to this Tmobile store I went to a tmobile store in Irvine they were not helpful and plain lazy. Then I went to This Tmobile store, great customer service answered all my question and had the phone I wanted. The employee took his time to see if he can find a product at other store I don't remember his name but I'm bad with name. Thanks for all your  help. 👍</Review>

Looks nice out and in. Too bad its always packed and takes forever to get to talk to sum1. Then when u do they tell u exact opposite of wut their customer care line says to, every time. And this is a corporate store its sad. Go to one on MacArthur and Bristol m7ch better service.</review>

They don't explain nothing to you at all. They tell you 5% of how everything will workout with the monthly bills on a family plan. When I switched from another company  to here they told me in 3 hours the numbers will transfer to the new phones they never told me I had to get the account number and pin from my old account  until I went back to see them. They never told me they would be adding taxes either. Their plan is to rob you from your money and give you bullshit ass excuses for not explaining anything at the begging. Also their so called no contract saying is bullshit they said the free phones aren't actually free until 2 years later. I'm switching to another company these people are bullshit same as at&t and Verizon they all want to rob you from your money. I don't recommend you getting a plan from here unless you want to get scammed.< /Text>

The representatives are so rude, by always looking at their phone while they are helping you or talking to their co-workers about what they are doing after work. I have been with T-Mobile for 7 years and I have never experienced such bad service like this store. Drive to another store, you will spend more gas but it will be worth it</Review>< rating>

(Translated by Google) I do not recommend you go to that store, they have a very bad service, they do not know how to avoid customers when you buy for the first time they serve you well, but when you return for some damage to the phone, they are no longer interested if you are satisfied anyway, you already bought them. I recommend

< review>
It's widely known that Toll Brothers builds absolutely beautiful homes, and the Sierra & Victoria communities are no exception. However, despite this, the sales experience has been by far the worst we have experienced so far.

We wish we could go into full detail, but because of Google's character limit, here's as much of a summary we could provide:
* Coordination between TBI and Toll Brothers was terrible. Prior to the Sierra & Victoria communities, we filed a pre-application for the Porter Ranch communities and still never heard back to this day. When we decided to pursue Sierra & Victoria a month later instead, we still had to physically visit the office to escalate after yet another week and a half of silence.
* Nearly impossible to get a hold of the sales team. Our agent only managed to reach the sales office over the phone twice (1 of which was only because they said they'd call after finally responding to 1 of the e-mail threads that finally got a response). The rest he had to physically visit. While all of this was happening, all of the other communities we visited were keeping us updated bi-weekly and sometimes even weekly, but we only got 2 phone calls over 4 months with Toll Brothers.
* The crux of this entire negative experience: the buyers list is a joke and shady sales communications. We could never even get an answer about our status/position on the list and was always told "we're still making our way down the list and we will call when it's your turn", which would've been fine had they actually followed their ordered list process. However, when they finally did call, they didn't disclose that it was an "interest-only call" and explicitly said "it's your turn!", noted down our preferences telling us we were second in line for some lots or even first for others, and then told us we would get a call when the actual release happens within the next 2 weeks. Fast forward a month to now, Toll Brothers still never ended up calling. We've been tracking the online site status like hawks every single day and eventually saw the lots taken in those 2 weeks even though we were noted as first on one of them. Our agent had to physically visit the office to ask what happened, and they ended up saying "sorry, that call was never for the actual reservation but only to gather interest" and - you guessed it - "we are still making our way down the list and will call you when it's your turn". Since they've been keeping us in the dark for months at a time now, we could only imagine this is a shady practice to gauge demand and screw other folks with higher prices since the prices went up another $13k online from the number we were given over the phone despite having a "list" process.

Keep in mind that while all of this was happening, all of the other communities were completely transparent with us, even sometimes sharing full price spreadsheets or site plans of upcoming phases despite them selling out just as rapidly as Toll Brothers at every new phase release. The only thing that kept us going for the past 4 months was because how beautiful the homes were, but if the "list" process continues the way it is, we'd like to warn you that the community is already halfway sold and we haven't even had our turn yet since August. Also, the price has gone up about 50k in those 3 months, so the value that they had before will most likely not be there by the time it gets to your turn.

With all of that in mind, we highly recommend others to stay away from Toll Brothers (as we already are with our friends who are also in the market) if you want to spare yourself the trouble and focus on the positive relationships that'll make your homebuying experience more enjoyable. We ended up going into contract with Landsea Homes who treated us well from day 1 despite us waiting a month longer than Toll Brothers since July and us also offering more to secure the lot. If you want to still take the chance, then best of luck, heed all of the similar warnings from everyone else on BBB, ConsumerAffairs, etc., and be prepared to be frustrated for months.<//review>

<review>I am buying a home from Toll Brothers. I have asked about the price of the single light at bedrooms and I was told the price is around $150. Even during my meeting on Feb, 11th, 2021 with the electrician the quoted price was below $170. He said the price has gone up from $150. He sent me the quote on Feb. 12th 2021, and I see an additional $230 for each switch of the lights. so the actual cost for each light is $400. None of bedrooms have any lights so you will end up paying an additional $400 for each room, loft, and  even your great room is not covered. @Toll Brothers, respect your customer and avoid doing scams like this. It hurts you in the long-run.<//review>< UserId.>

<text>Okay, the model houses are beautiful; tastefully accented, adorned, built out... You will not be buying those.The model houses are literally impossible at the price-point you see when you walk in the door. I feel like a goober that when I saw those prices and toured those houses, I was ready to just move in, that I thought the Zillow price would get me the model house.  I think perhaps everyone just knows this is the way and I was just the goofball that didn't. IDK. I was so naive then. Watch me as I play my tiny violin. World's tiniest.

I have looked at a lot of houses.  This review is not for people who have bought in. If you're all in, you need to read a review about the customer service experience. If you're on the fence about this process, I think my words have substance. I did see more than one home that was built within the last 5 years. If you're buying a new house in SCV, it's likely Toll Bros, KB, 5 Knolls, or Pardee. It's a crazy market so I toured over 30 houses before finding mine. (It wasn't a toll bros home and this is why I walked away.) the model house I saw looked nothing like the houses built in the last 5 years.

The houses built in the last 5 years from these vendors that are already on the market had some hardwood/laminate/vinyl on the first floor and tastefully cheap carpet on the second floor, and nothing in the back yard. (At least the ones I remember seeing) The model houses I toured had built-in BBQs, square pools, step-down fire pits, glass cases in the closets... The model houses are literally impossible at the price-point you see when you walk in the door. I know, I wrote that above. I'm repeating because... Even if you pick the most expensive brand of everything... You can't get a square pool from Toll. You likely cant even get the faux brick facade that goes all the way to the top of the 20 ft ceiling.

I mean, let's be fair, there's a 20 ft ceiling. That's cool. There's a lot that's cool, but, if you're just now thinking about getting on that wait list, ask them... "How do I get that square pool? How do I get the funky cool geometric wall paneling? How do I get that step down fire pit? How do I get that [insert cool thing]?" If the answer to any of your "how-cool-is-that's" is, "Not from us, but you could probably do it," then it may not be for you.

I'm not saying this is bait and switch because I'm no lawyer. But when I worked at Sears as a teenager, once a month I had to check all the prices to make sure they were accurate. Because, if someone reports you to Weights and Measures and the price you promised with the pictures you listed isn't the same, you get fined.  Now, what is eerily familiar is that the pictures you see on Zillow and the model homes you tour will likely not represent the house you live in at the price quoted to you.

If I am incorrect, when supplied with photos of price v product depicting better accuracy than what I experienced, I will attempt to list/add/update them to this review pursuant to my own timeline of personal importance.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Toll brother definitely one of the few quality builders that still around. Their models are alot similar to what the housing market trending now days. Small backyard more house space. Master bedroom are not large but I like the balcony size over the patio and the glass doors. Everything seems to be modern style with nice finishing< /Review>< Pictures>

We've been pretty happy with our new home. Construction manager and assistant are beyond amazing but customer service SUCKS! There are a few issues with our house that we need addressed. The customer service guy was supposed to be here at 9am...its now 4pm and he still has not showed up!! I've been sitting at home all day waiting for him and have had to cancel some plans I had for this afternoon. First, he called at 9 and said it was going to be closer to 10...ok, fine. 1:00 rolls around and he calls and says he will be here at 2:00. Haven't heard from him since and we cant call him because he said he isn't allowed to give out his phone number! TOLL BROTHERS HAS PLENTY OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO BUY WORK CELL PHONES FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES!!!! This is totally unacceptable.<//review>

<review>I should be giving this place two and a half star's rating, took my car to get it washed I asked one of the main worker not to vacuum the inside of my car because I've already done it, also asked if he can give me a discount he said regular wash is $26 I'll charge you $23 said ok still expensive but I've heard great things about this place so got my car washed and believe it or not they did a terrible job car wasn't even cleaned they just put saop rinse it dryed it and that's it, I expected them to do a good job for the price that they charge but that wasn't the case, next time I'll take it to the 76 gas station car wash which costs only $6.99 forces car wash.</review><Name>Danlucas Garstrada<//Name>< pics>

< Review>
This place is great and very reasonable and prompt service. The only thing i would complain is that the guy who does vacuum throw away my belongings. He thought it was trash but it’s legit tumbler. You should hide if there anything if he doesn’t want to throw it away< /Review>

<Text>I haven't had a bad experience here yet. Just got my seats cleaned because my baby vomited in it a couple weeks ago. Haven't had the time to get it taken care of because I've been working 60hr weeks. So imagine it's been sitting for a while. When I called the dude told me $75 bucks i thought to myself maybe he doesn't know what he's dealing with lol. I expected the prices to change once they seen the seats. But to my surprise they didn't,  and they took their time and hand washed the seats which i was leary about at first but after seeing the results.... needless to say I was impressed! This place is AWESOME!</Text><username>Rudy Drayton< /username><time>1610846939444< /time>< UserId.>

<Review>I saw they had great ratings, but I wasn’t expecting them to be this good. I honestly couldn’t be more impressed. Im definitely coming back. Like I’m sitting here watching them with my car and others’ cars and they pay attention to details that I would if I were doing the work on my own car. Seriously awesome and respectable, and they were all friendly. Highly recommend</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Pretty nice spot to wash your car, prices are different for truck and cars, I believe for trucks its 5 dollars more from original price. Sitting areas are available if you decide to wait, if not there is a subway across the street and other goodies to grab a quick bite.</review>< Pics>

<time>1458359965073< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Highly recommended this car wash ! I'm a long-time customer and have found Gustavo and his team to be very hardworking and meticulous. Of course, there will always be times when there's a new employee learning on-the-job, but you can always ask that person to re-do something if he happens to miss a spot while in training. The whole crew really strives to go above-and-beyond to please their customers, which is why they're always super busy at that location...needless to say their reasonable prices are hard to beat as well!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I will always get my car washed here.  The prices are extremely reasonable. In addition,  whatever level of wash you get,  you can expect to get your car back looking brand new.  The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.</review>

<text>They washed the car good, but they stare to much when u ask who's the owner they'll turn and laugh and in case the people are wondering who wrote this is was the black 10 year own girl wearing blue and red slippers. So I know I'll never go there again!

Hope this is helpful to yall!😜<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Had my car washed there they did a bad job I paid for a Diamond level clean and there was a lot of dirt still on the car like they sprayed it and didn't wash it with there hands, and I have a convertible and there was lint all over the cloth top where it meets the body of the car, (like it was the first time washing a rag top) With the Diamond level you get Armor-all in the interior, and it was streaky and missing in other places. I was really mad and I don't think I will return. I wasn't expecting a perfect job at all, but I a paid for the 3rd level of cleaning and had expectations of car being cleaned.< /Text>

Horrible gas station
If I could I would give it zero starts
First of all the fuel pump that I got said that I could only pay inside
So I went inside and this girl with NO CUSTOMER service skills whatsoever was inside and had a horrible attitude
After trying to figure out how to put my fuel rewards in the machine before swiping my credit card (I usually swipe it outside and it does it automatically. And she didn’t even offer to help me) I finally am able to figure it out and swipe my card to put gas.
Then I go outside to the station where my car is, just to realize that the machine is saying that I haven't paid and cant put gas yet.
Confused, I try and go back inside to tell the unhelpful girl, just to find out that the door to the store is locked and theres this sign on the door saying that they will be back like in 40 minutes. So now I’m stuck out here having to wait, and hope, that she will be back on time and can actually help me out and not try and rip me off or something.
And to finish it, I tried calling the number on the window for the store just to not have anyone pick up and have a SPANISH voicemail go through at the end of the call. I left a voicemail. Haven’t hear back fro  them obviously.
I don’t know how people in Mexico handle their businesses, and frankly I don’t care. But if they are gonna be this unprofessional, then they better just stay in their country and not bring their bad habita to the U.S. ...<//Text>

Near the border but very crowdy with many cars and it's sometimes hard to line in.  Restroom is outside.  There are a lot of money exchange location across the street.<//text>

<text>Visited this location yesterday afternoon & the witch older Latina cashier had a terrible attitude: she said, "One second" & raised her finger when I asked for the restroom key. I waited for a minute, then a man approached her asked for the restroom key & she said, "It's there," while pointing to it. Wow! Crude unhappy woman. Franchise management: inside the restroom, the soap dispenser needs to be replaced/paper towels need to be replenished more often.</text>< pics>

A-1 Self Storage in Belmont is so great! Tim and Daniel were extremely helpful over the phone and in person regarding all of my questions. The setup process was seamless and quick. If you're looking for Self Storage in the Bay Area - highly recommend A-1 in Belmont!! Thanks Tim and Daniel :)<//review>

This has to be my favorite facility from all the different storage facilities I’ve visited. Upon entering I was kindly greeted by Tim and Daniel who introduced themselves immediately. The price is great in comparison to others. They also did a great job explaining what sets them apart from all the competitors. I made a great decision coming here.</review>

The space I got was a little too small, with no inside light in my unit, but other than that, the Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The restroom always clean. The place is well maintained and the inside hallways are well illuminated by natural lighting, large windows.< /review>

Tim was absolutely fantastic! I called super last minute (about 5 mins before arriving) frantic because the storage unit I reserved down the street had no one in the office or answering my calls, while I had movers on the property with my stuff ready to move in. I told him I was in a rush to not keep the movers waiting any longer. He totally understood and helped me go through the process super quickly. I would highly recommend renting here, especially because of Tim’s service, but it also seems really secure!< /text>

Amazing experience.   Everything was done quick and easy even though I had to get the storage last minute because UHaul storage was a huge fail. Will def use A-1 Self Storage again for any future storage needs.< /review>

< Review>
We just re-rented at at A-1 Self Storage in Belmont with JP. We keep coming back for all our storage needs because the facility is spotless, the office is well supplied and JP is pleasant, courteous, and professional!  He takes a personal interest in the cleanliness of the facility and the satisfaction of his customers. It is because of JP and the way he runs the facility that we come back to A-1. The facility is temperature controlled clean in 10 years we’ve never seen a rat or a mouse. If he sees a piece of trash he immediately sweeps it up the units are clean upon move-in and the facility is secured I don’t believe they’ve ever had a break in, so if you’re looking for a clean safe place to store your belongings I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend A-1 Self Storage in Belmont!</Review>

There are two large elevators for easy access.

Really nice and friendly guy. Tim was very helpful. Better than the two others that I went to,
that are close by. Price was $50 more a month for 10 extra feet, that I had down the street. They raised my monthly rate to almost $50 a month at the place down the street. So I came to A-1 and got a 10x25 for a place inside very close to the door for $399. He said they raise the price after 6 months and then once a year.
The place down the street raises their price every months. The other place they raise at least 2. Times a year or more. She said since it was a 10x30 for a $100 more a month. You get the second month free. Which is nice.

A-1 Storage in Belmont, Ca was my first storage experience and a great one at that!  The folks who work in the office are so helpful.  They answered so many questions when I was looking for a unit and showed me around their facility.  They let me know the ins & outs of everything from security, renting, auto-payments and I even had my own online account to make changes if need be.  They are very responsive over email as well as phone too.  After a year and a half of renting a unit I was ready to move my belongings out and even the check-out process was a piece of cake!  I emailed them to notify them of my unit termination and they emailed me back the same day to confirm receipt and let me know how the process of check-out would happen.
Secure & clean facility, lovely helpful people working there.  Highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>I wanted to make sure you knew how wonderful the Belmont facility is and how pleased I was to store my things there for the year.  I am a teacher and was making a job transition so I needed a storage unit to store my classroom for a year.

If I didn't want to save money I would have kept my storage unit just because I loved this facility and their customer service!! From the time I called them on the phone to registering in person, using the facility,  and finally closing out my unit,  the people and place were top notch!  I highly recommend this place if you need a storage unit.  JP and Antonio were so helpful,  friendly,  and professional.  Prices are reasonable and the facility is clean,  well-lit  and safe. I was sad to leave!</Review>< pictures>

Excellent experience, I cannot recommend A-1 highly enough.  I looked at many storage facilities around the peninsula before going with A-1, and I'm very glad I did.  Antonio and JP are both very professional and always accessible to answer any questions.  They also keep the very large facility immaculate.  I had to change spaces at one point, and then vacate the facility mid-month, and they made each procedure go very smoothly. If I ever need storage space again, they will be the facility I use.  Five stars!<//Review>

I had to make arrangements long distance and found the staff at this facility, helpful, accommodating and friendly.  When I arrived in town,  they showed me the unit I had reserved, which was clean and ready for occupancy.  They also showed me how to use the lock and access the unit, using the elevator keypad. They have hand trucks available for use and parking next to the elevator, which made unloading and transport easy and efficient. A big thank you to the staff for your excellent customer service!

A year and a half later:  I am adding this later post since I have now ended my stay at A-1 Storage in Belmont California.

Antonio and JP have both been the most helpful, customer service oriented staff that I have ever encountered. They have gone above and beyond the call of duty to coordinate with a professional organizer I hired, to move things out of storage on my behalf when I needed to be out of town.

They are polite, patient courteous and have performed well beyond my expectations.  I truly felt as if the contents are well protected and safe in this facility.  I wish every interaction I have could be so easy and accommodating.  My heartfelt gratitude goes to Antonio and JP.  I will recommend this storage facility to friends and use them again without hesitation, if needed.</text>

Great experience with A-1 Self Storage.  Everyone was incredibly professional, courteous and helpful.  The facility is very modern and clean.  And when you reserve a unit, they tell you the unit number and guarantee that it's yours.  Such a wonderful contrast from the clowns/crooks at Public Storage, where you reserve online and then you show up and they tell you that they don't have that unit anymore, but they have a different unit at a worse price.   I will definitely use A-1 again if I need storage space.</review>

This place is great. Antonio was SO helpful in getting me set up with a storage unit. He explained all the details, walked me around the place and made me feel very comfortable with storing my belongings with A-1. The place itself is very clean, smells great, and is brightly lit. I couldn't recommend this place highly enough!< /review>

I have used this storage facility for ~5 years. I recently vacated because of a move. The staff was always friendly, courteous and helpful. The building is always neat and clean and extremely well lit. No matter what time I went in, whether the office was opened or closed, I always felt comfortable. Overall, a terrific experience. I highly recommend this facility.<//Review>

The highest recommendation!  There is the best customer service I have ever met! The storage is clean and has a conditioner. They has some units for 1st month free special! It really works without any additional fee. Easy commute from 101.  I simply love it! Thank you very much!<//Text>

<Review>Utilized A-1 Storage in Belmont for the past couple of years until recently relocating. Antonio and JP were always professional,  accommodating  and pleasant to interact with. They both consistently went out of their way to meet the customer's need . Excellent customer service. Hope the higher-ups at A-1 realize what great assets they both are .

These guys were great! Was in a rush to get my things moved out of storage one weekend, and was only able to do it while office hours were close, so I wasn't able to close my account. The following week was extremely busy as well, so I didn't get around to calling them to cancel. But, to my surprise, I received an email saying they had found my unit unlocked and empty during their routine walk through, so they closed my account for me so I wouldn't be build for extra time that I wasn't using the unit. But also said they can open my account right back up if closing was not my intention.
This is a great, clean, and well kept place!<//Text>

A-1 Self Storage in Belmont is by far the best storage facility I've ever used.  The staff here was always friendly and professional.  My unit in Belmont was safe, clean and dry; and kept my belongings in great condition.  Their key-less entry into the building made accessing my unit very convenient especially early in the mornings or late evenings .  Thank you A-1!<//Review>

I recently rented a unit from JP at A1 Self Storage in Belmont, CA and JP was extremely helpful! He explained everything so clearly for me. JP had such great customer skills! The units are actually larger than I expected and the whole facility was very clean. I highly recommend renting from here!!< /Review>

I chose A-1 because it was competitive and near my home. A-1 has met my every need since I checked in on Monday Dec 14, 2015. Service has been excellent and storage area sparkling clean. I really appreciate the push carts provided on site. Only praises for A-1.</Review>

<review>I've been renting a unit at A-1 in Belmont for several years.  In all this time, I've never been anything but completely satisfied by the quality of service, availability, and professional, friendly attention of the employees.  They've always been extremely helpful when I've had a question or problem, and always ready with a smile or a friendly word.  Furthermore, JP and James do an outstanding job of maintaining a clean and well-run facility, as exemplified by their consistent efforts to keep the place clean and safe (despite the unfortunate sloth/laziness of others who seem to feel it is their right to leave their trash or unwanted belongings behind!).  JP and James are always on the move with upkeep and ever ready to lend a helping hand!  And the results are obvious to see:  the cleanest, best-kept storage unit rental facility on the Peninsula!  Thank you guys!! You're awesome!<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
Back in July, I(Cynthia Behrend) had the good fortune to have JP & James at the front desk.  They were courteous & patient while answering my many questions and very helpful in finding the correct size & location for our storage needs…now fast forward to 10/2 @ 5:15pm.That's when I arrived @ A-1 Storage with my movers to unload my storage unit. While the movers were unloading my unit I went to the office to do the paper work. JP explained that the A-1 Storage in Oakland would  be closed by the time we arrived. He confirmed my reservation in Oakland. He explained how the kiosk worked. He gave us detailed directions to the location of the storage unit AND he gave me his phone# just in case I had difficulty with the kiosk. When the kiosk didn't respond, I called JP(it was 8pm) & he was able to help me find my reservation. Because of JP's extraordinary customer service I was able to complete the move before 10pm. I am very grateful, thank you.</Review>

After I talk to JP and Antonio the costumer service at the desk, they give me the reason why:
Trust, cainest, security and great experience on explaining everything,  they found me the right size when I really struggle, besides the paper work was  1,2,3 smooth.

I recommend them please talk to them before you run into another storage.
Thx JP and Antonio.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This is one of the samples not to base on reviews.

Its amazing! I've had the pizza, chicken, fingers, 2 pastas and nuggets. I loved it !!!

I absolutely love everything and it was so fast. The pizza was delicious, pasta absolutely mouth watering, everything delicious. The plus is everything for only $7 each in CA!!!! As mentioned on website.

I do not always review,  but this one really worth the experience.

Great Job guys!</text>

Called to place an order and while receiving and sending information was proceeded to get screamed at by the employee taking the order as he was confused and frustrated at me for no reason. Do your job sir and wait for me to place my order. You are an embarrassment to your franchise. I will never order from here again. Call was placed at 10:15pm on a Friday night.<//text>

< Review>
They keep changing their prices. First I was told I couldn't get my usual-  triple pepperoni. I was told they don't do that. I informed the guy that's what I've always order & I just got 1 last week. The latest letdown was they don't honor the tv advertisement for 3 toppings for $7.99. The guy tried to charge me $ 16 for the same pizza that i paid $7.99 last week. I walked away & they lost the sale & my business. I'd advise staying away from this business. It's pure BS. This has happened a couple of times. STAY AWAY - it's a matter of principle<//Review>

Terrible customer service to say the least. Waited 30 minutes after the screen show my order ready. They couldn’t find my pizza. Wanted me to wait more to make another one without even saying sorry for the delay. One star is more than they deserve. Going to another store next time< /Text>

Very unprofessional and rude. I talked to someone named Sean, he certainly doesn’t have an idea about customer service and was very rude on phone. Whoever owns this place should make sure people they hire understand the importance of customer service. No matter how good you are in any other areas, if you are rude to your customers, it’s worthless.
I generally don’t do reviews, but this person’s attitude and behavior forced me to.< /text>

Placed an order for pickup at 5 PM via their app. The app says it was done at arrive 4:52. I arrived at 4:56 and they said it'll take another 15 minutes. By the time they completed the order it was 5:16. This is the third time in a row that they've been late on the order while their app said it was ready for pickup.</text>

<text>Follow up from the last review from a few years back.

Yay, they have turned around, the service has improved, delivery is quicker, thin crust and handmade pan is just amazing and yes we love pineapple on our pizza :)..good turn around, a regular now.

Leaving the old below to show the improvements over the years....

Horrible is not enough for this place...if there was a negative star option that would still be less.

Totally mismanaged for takeouts. Delivery takes forever so I decided to do a takeout, it turned out to be even worse. All the guys were on phone and there was a big line to even talk to the guys behind the counter.

It takes an army to make a pizza but it takes twice the manpower for just one of them to talk to ppl. Standing in line.< /text>< Pics>

What's to complain about? You can order via their frustration free website or phone app and in less than 40 minutes have HOT, decent quality pizza at your doorstep.

I order delivery from these guys 4-6 times a year and I'm always impressed. Never gotten a pizza that wasn't hot, and I can't remember ever waiting more than 45 minutes.

You've got to give it to these guys. For what they are - a chain restaurant that specializes in delivering hot pizza, fast - they really get the job done.  It's refreshing to see a well run business. Five stars.< /Text>

<review>I ordered online and was happy to find a coupon too.  Excellent to see and be notified of each step toward dinner tonight and I didn't even have to cook.  What's better is that they were out of my salad dressing I wanted and called to explain to me instead of just showing up with the news at my door.   Branoon showed up on time and with a smile.  Then was amazed to find out that he had found my dressing after all.  Not only did he give it to me but extra too.  Now that's awesome service!  The food is delicious and we are very happy with our order!!!</review>< gmapID>

It took 25 mins for them to deliver to medium pizzas. I waiting a whole hour for them to make it as well. My food was super cold, when my house is just 3 mins away from dominos. Extremely disappointed because when I called to complain they ended the phone on me multiple times. HORRIBLE! DONT GO HERE! THEY DONT DO THEIR JOB!!!!<//Text>

Since this is a closer pizza place near my home, I used to order several times recently. Normal wait time would be 15-20 minutes for carry out and most of the times, I have gotten the order ready within promised time. Quality of the pizza has been good too so far.< /Text>

Has been over a year since we ordered from here.  This will likely be our last time ever.  Tipped on the order, and got a dry, burned pizza.  We trashed it.< /Review>

An absolutely terrible experience. Ordered for carry out. Once it was ready online, I went to go pick it up, but they burnt one pizza. They were also behind on everyone in there so it took an extra 35 minutes to get my pizza. Will not be coming to this dominos ever again.</Text>

<review>First let me start with the first incident I had with these guys . I am a vegetarian and I order a veggie pasta. After a 45 minute wait I finally get my pasta ! I check for the label just in case to avoid mistakes and it shows my order. I open the order and I find chicken pasta. I call the store and I receive no refund , no store credit and get a very cold reply . I ignore the incident and let it be. Next time I order a pasta and pizza ...when i receive a call from the store..asking us to change the order since they are out of pasta... okay ......i calm myself down...tell myself...its the weekend and end of the day so they really must be out of pasta...... Now i am waiting in total hunger for my food...I keep the food tracker open in a hope to see when the guy leaves the store and I might get my pasta..... 10 minutes since the driver left the store with my pizza... no one at the door... since I was very sure how far the store was from where I live.... I knew there would be a knock at the door very soon... 20 minutes ...nope no food !!!! 30 minutes ...NOPE ! Now i call the store....and a very nice...soft spoken ("Sarcasm") gentleman answers my call and literally shouts at me for asking him where my food was !!! " then i cut the call and wait for my pizza...I finally get my pizza and bread sticks since there was no pasta...and wait... No Dip !!!!! but i clearly mentioned I needed one...I run down ask the driver for the dip and I get the usual cold reply saying he has no clue...since only bringing the food was his job..... I call the manager again...ask him where my dip was and get spoken to very rudely...so rude that I had to cut the call... then I start having my pizza...okay thank god...after all this I have a tasty pizza to enjoy....Now what do i find?/??? Hair !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are u serious?? Now whom do I call ? the manager who does not even have the minimum courtesy to be polite to your angry customer  and hell yeah !! angry for a reason ! Bad service....poor food quality... Please I request you not to have food ordered from this store unless and until you want to have hair as your pizza topping !< /review></record></dataset><record>

Good deals, yummy pizza and parmesan bites! However, if you purchase sauces, you can almost guarantee they will forget to give them to you unless you specifically ask. We've called them on it multiple times and it's always the same problem. There has been no effort made to apologize or offer anything in recompense.<//Text>

It took over 40 minutes for just delivery. I live less than 2 miles away. Got hung up on when I called to complain. I called back and was placed on hold and no one ever came back on the line. Pretty sure I got over charged when I ordered 2 med two topping pizza's that are advertised for 5.99 and was charged 7.99 each.<//review>

<text>This store is totally unorganized.  I called for delivery and paid for my pizza. I was told there was a minimum purchase for delivery to my area, which I met.  I later got a call that I would have to pick it up, which I did.  When I got there I was asked to pay for it (again).  I explained I had paid over the phone and they told me it had been voided.  I paid for it again, and today I have 5 charges on my card for the same amount, which triggered a fraud alert.  I got it cleared up with my bank, but this store is mismanaged.  I'll never go there again.</text>< gmap_id>

<Text>First thing: Don't order over the phone. Never. Order online. The interface is awesome and there are tons of coupons to choose from.

The one place where this store struggles is delivery and takeout times. It doesn't matter what time of day, these guys are always slammed. But they do future orders so this makes it obsolete. Just don't expect to order a pizza saturday night and expect it to get there before 8.

Overall, it's a good store. Idk why I'm writing this review it's late and... idk</Text>< response>

Worst Domino's experience I've ever had. Placed the order at 5:30 and waited 2 and half hours for the food to arrive. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE. Their line also never works so you can't even call in to complain or get an update on the status of your order.< /Review>

I worked at this location for awhile, now i work at the one in danville. Their management is so care-free its insane! When we would get orders, they would say it doesnt matter how long it takes to make it, or how long it takes to deliver. And they hated taking orders at night, sometimes they wouldnt answer or just make up stories to not make the pizza. At my location in davnille its like night and day, sadly we dont deliver to the san ramon area :/< /Review>

They hung up on me twice even asking to speak to the manager. This was the worst experience I’ve had over the phone I’m not ordering from them ever! Not good costumer service at all< /Text>

Standard dominos. This place does has sub par customer service, but order online and you dont have to deal with people. Because its dominos food, wont go above 3 stars. Is cheap though<//Text>

<text>Ordered two pizzas one with only olives and one with four veggies... the pizza had barely any veggies and i was told by the manager that when you order with more veggies it will be like that... shame I have ordered from this very Dominos pizzas in the past and it was never like this ... also the customer service at pick up was very poor and not friendly at all.. .. a simple smile while transacting will go a long distance..never used to be like this about 1 year back when i used to frequent it more often.< /text><UserId.>117944982049714172536<//UserId.><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>All Fraud. I select chicken and olives, it charges me more than $5.99, whereas they advertise 2-topping pizza is $5.99. When I call them, they say "Chicken costs extra". All Fraud. Never order Dominos again.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Wondering why the deal is two medium pizzas for $5.99 each.
But every time I order, the first pizza is $5.99 and the second is always $6.49.

Week days are not always full, we came here one time on a Saturday, it was too crowded! Hint: better come here on weekdays, but weekdays are always busy for school and work, but if you have the chance better come here on weekdays. Sure it doesn’t get crowded. Parking is available for free. Best value and experience for kids to enjoy.  Parties for kids are available, good idea! No fuss preparing at home. Just bring the celebrant and guests here and everything is worth it! Food is great, pizza is always made fresh!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpO8FSKXYldxsRhOTSypVov3PrlIfdV7PXgsV9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt_KOeUYnhjrEZuBOybu3gIGXrJXfJk0y_UPpP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODF9GJnfjOrn1DZHflS-tEOkryuT0DHPit71H6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfCgS3NFBxK9HPRTM6LyxXs_0Up0lF5U-4oIwE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE3QfvJr86u4izLDwdYzirwlzpSdzrvtIzl8yo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvy6vDJuQV2BT3HjUO1Gu9ds2dT2ifxzoPoFcE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOT0AA34ma7lcbH-BPpSsq2k2ZotpTG2UhfZHO5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0ROWj6QPyHqDjH6r7EfN3xhRlfQ2hhJ5O0Q1P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuc1cKTgGE6lTpmDfW4SBnHDnU9VIVQO0vPV1w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJgcB3tD-Sps4Gn9mwcp0-7gD4_lYGLB99Crgq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>My son loves Chuck E Cheese. He will hog the toddler basketball game for as long as you let him. I love most that you can get a card for games based on time rather than games played. I always get like 90 minutes and it's good enough for a small outing away. Every other month or so I take him and spend the entire day but our little 90 minutes is a regular thing. He loves it; My 12 year old did too but grew out of it and he loves Dave and Busters now.</review><name>Shannon Johnson</name>< Date>

Clean, fun and safe - children can't escape outside which makes this place more relaxing for parents. Loved their photo booths, they usually cost around $5 in amusement parks, much more affordable at Chuck E cheese.</text>

I arrived 15 minutes before the party like I was asked I didn’t get anyone to help us check in until 10 minutes AFTER the party was supposed to start. While I was checking in the table still wasn’t set up for the party! When I asked what was going on and why it hasn’t been set the guy kept saying he doesn’t know that he was stepping in as a manager there from another location. Which is annoying because even as acting manage you still have things how they are supposed to be! You’re a manager from another location you should still know how to run one that isn’t yours. So now 20 minutes after the paid time I requested the table is just getting set! Gianni “the manager” was our host which was horrible he came to the table maybe TWO times! So sad we couldn’t find him anywhere. We kept having to ask the lady who was a host to two other tables to help us because she couldn’t find him either. Mind you the lady had about two or three tables that she was handling wonderful and he had just the one that he wasn’t paying attention to at all!! When he brought the pizza out he had the wrong pizzas! So of course I was upset because I place the booking online with the pizzas and the day before they called me to confirm the pizza. Oh and when I checked in they confirmed as well! Very annoying he said he was going to replace the wrong pizza and he would be back. He never came back with the right pizza! (First time he came to the table since we checked in) now it’s time to do cakes and I see all the other kids with their cakes they get ready to sing and I have to tell someone WAIT! My girls don’t have their cakes and here the comes (the manager) with my girls cake still in the box that still need the toppers all on it. I was so upset because all the other people got their cakes in enough time to put candles and set it up, here I am trying to rush putting everything because he was doing god knows what! (Second time to the table) at that point I was beyond over him and that location! I was mad because my guest could see how bad he was handling the party as well. It was just a overall horrible experience! His name was Gianni. It was so bad that I had guest tell me at the party and after to report how horrible he was the fact that he was late doing everything he had nerve to give us attitude every time he came to the table, especially when we asked questions! Like how can you be mad at me that you brought out the WRONG pizza?!<//Text>< Pictures>

Depending on your age group please adjust your expectations. For a 40 old dad I need to mentally return to the age of 5. In this case it is amazing! Soooo much fun. Can't wait to go back. As a 41 year old, it's dirty, employees look unhealthy, chuck E Cheese needs a vacation badly and the food looked positively unsafe. But then again, this place isn't for adults. Kids had a blast and we ate elsewhere. Apparently we will be back..... FML< /Text>

Normally, not a fan of Chuck-E-Cheese, for all the obvious reasons (loud, busy, expensive). HOWEVER, I booked a party online and when the day came, my husband and I went in to talk about what exactly we should order pizza wise for our group size. THANK GOD we went in, cause had we shown up for our party at 5pm, nothing would have been set up. I BOOKED THE PARTY ONLINE FOR THE WRONG DAY! I had accidently booked it for the following Monday. The store manager and manager of operations were absolutely amazing and made us feel like it was no big deal. They dealt with getting everything switched over, helped us figure out how much pizza we would need (we had exactly what we needed!), and when I was so embarrassed, were kind. When we walked in a few hours later, it was like it was planned weeks ago. They didn't skip a beat. Our server for the evening was amazing. She went on break towards the end of the party, but came back to look me in the eyes and thank me for her tip.

I'm not a fan of Chuck-e-cheese on the weekends, but on a Monday night (we are not amateurs at party planning lol) it was perfect! Not busy, not as loud and we were able to keep track of all the kids in our party without stress.

100% would go back and support this business and the people in it.< /text>

<review>We like Chuck E. Cheese, especially the concord location. Many of the games here were not working or giving out tickets. The photo rides were out of paper and so many of them were scattered on the floor. It seemed to be under staffed since it took me about 7min to have someone come take my food order and the staff did not seem happy. Just disappointed, will be going back to another location.< /review>< Pictures>

We came here for a birthday party for a 5 yr old. The pizza's were good and the Chuck e cheese show was great, judging by how captivated the kids were towards the characters. The kids (toddlers to early teens) all had a great time playing the variety of games. The game cards that allowed them to play as many games as they would like for 2 hours is a great idea. They get tickets for how well they do after a game. The little prizes they can buy with the tickets is just icing on the cake! I gave it 4 stars and the kids a 5 so I gave the review a 5. Who cares what I think!</Review>

As I walked into the Chuck E. Cheese, I expected to have a grand time. My daughter ran off with her little card and was having the time of her life, and I ordered a pizza and sat down. The little floor show was about to start and I wanted to watch, as it had been many years since I had last entered a Chuck E. Cheese, but as the demon rat stared into my soul and judged me for my sins, I knew that God was angry with me. So long story short, we had a great time and we’ll be back soon!<//text>

I'm used to run down CC with only 1/4 of the games working and horrible staff but this location is exactly what I remember CC is supposed to be. It's clean, good pizza, all the games worked and the one that didn't was fixed within 5 minutes of mentioning it. The staff was great and they had plenty of team members to deal with 3 seperate birthday parties and still managed to make our group feel special. Best CC we've been to in decades.< /Review>

Pretty good place. We went on a Thursday at 11am. Not very busy. We arrived right when they opened but they were still cleaning up from the day before. There was a mop bucket and towel around which they did not remove. For a kid's casino 😀, it was pretty good. Pizza buffet was good.<//text>

This isn't a bad place to take your kids for a little fun, but that's also because there's not many options in Dublin. I was disappointed in the games they had, as they were different from other Chuck e cheese locations I've been to before. Much of the floor is taken up by the stage and the tables in front of it, which is a waste in my opinion. The salad bar didn't look too appetizing, but they do have cheap pizza that looks decent. My two year old had a good time, but they need more stuff for the smaller kids like her.</Text>

<Review>A great place to bring the kids on a weekend.  There were some machines which were not dispensing tickets or not giving out tokens, but the service attendant quickly resolved the issue and giving us extra tokens and tickets.  Food is just ok, but service is great.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Gmap_id>

Went here for my little brothers birthday. We asked for endless salad bar and pizza.
The manager comes up to us as we are eating our salad and rudely accuses us of stealing salad. Turns out the cashier didn’t ring us up for the salad.
But the manager was soooo RUDE.<//text>

Horrible food .....Just a place to spend money and get nothing....... But if you want to sit down and do nothing let your kids run around and not worry about them, it's probably a good place to go... Sometimes you need a time out for yourself... Then yes it's at least a little bit of a breather...</text>

Everyone else keeps saying it's too small and too overcrowded on the weekends but no one forced you to go there on a weekend. Also what do you expect? That is when most parents are off of work and can take there children somewhere. As for it being too small, if you have a problem with its size then why don't you donate some money to expand it. If you have a problem with that, then stop complaining about menial things. And the "feet smell" comment? Tell your fellow patrons to not allow their children to run rampant without footwear.

The staff here is hard-working, friendly and patient. The restaurant is adequate size and this is a great place to play some games and eat some pizza. If you are expecting anything more go someplace else.< /review>

The good: the arcade games are great for toddlers and young kids. I like how the have many smaller versions of traditional arcade games. The bad: prizes/toys are given for the exchange of tickets which are won att each game however, the games aren't always stocked with tickets which then becomes frustrating to explain to your child and almost impossible to get help for. Add to that the tickets equivalent prices and it makes you wonder why they even offer tickets and prizes.<//Text>

<Text>My daughter loves this place, so I do my best  to tolerate it.  She has fun playing the games and redeeming her tickets. The major issue is that they are always severely understaffed.  One person is often taking orders, passing out plates/cups AND working the prize redemtion counter. Hire a few more people and it might make tolerable into fun< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fec6a31907d7d:0x1d43cd4f69a6ebc2<//gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

Recently changed management. They have improved overall cleanliness throughout the dining area and games. Recently switched to card base games instead of tokens, which makes it much more convenient.</Text>

<Review>Who doesn't love Chuck E. Cheese?? I usually love Chuck E. Cheese but this particular visit there was a game machine stuck making a really annoying loud noise that didn't do a thing for my migraine. They said they were trying to fix it. Unplug it or something pppllleeaasse
Anyways, the salad bar was good, the pizza was good. The employees could have been a little more fun, after all its Chuck E. Cheese!  It could have been a little cleaner but one employee was stocking the salad bar on her break so they are probably understaffed. Chuck and his band only played once which was  dissapointing. I'm sure I will return again.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Waaaaayyy to long of lines and the food orders as well. 30 minutes the first time and almost an hour for the second. Not to mention they're a pricey. And to add...most of the games were either broken or out of tickets. To make things worse... The ticket counting machine was a fraud. Put in tickets and no count... Poorly managed and staffed.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Great place for kids birthday party. Arcade games, small playing cars/trains for kids to hop in. Chucky  (cartoon costume) comes during the cake cutting and every kid on the floor was super excited !!
Nice options for kids to buy with ticketed points.

Food was ok, some games are not working.<//text>

<Review>I am absolutely appalled and disappointed in this place. We just got home after having my son's 4th birthday here. There was literally not a thing more they could have done to make this night worse. Our party was supposed to be from 4-6pm. We got there at 3:45pm like we were supposed to and they didn't even know which table would be ours. They didn't have a dedicated hosting for us, but we had to share with other parties for a host. They didn't even have a table ready till nearly 5pm. I had ordered the food with our host around 4:15pm and we were not served any food till almost 5:40pm. We only got two pizzas at this time even though I'd ordered 4. Took another 15-20mins for the adult pizzas. They had to keep asking me what my son's name was because the hosts were switching. One of them had to nerve to tell me that the party would still run smoothly and that we'd still get out on time because she wanted to leave for home right after the party. I'm sorry, but I'm paying for two hours,  so I'd like my two hours. The bathrooms weren't even use able. Even single stall was absolutely filthy. (I have pics of every single one if upper management would like to see the deplorable condition this place is in.) The party stage was littered with supplies and looked terrible. It was 6:30pm before they even asked my son to do the ticket blaster. He didn't get a cape like the other four parties because they ran out... so my son who was talking about being a super hero at this place all week got a 'medallion' instead. They never gave us any silverware for cake and we had to rummage through the boxes on the front stage for forks for the cake and salad bars. They never even brought the cups for the adults at the party and we all had to share with the kids. After all this I spoke to the manager several times and she refused to even discount the party because she was allowing us to stay as long as we wanted... like we wanted to be there was long as we were because of that service. The 'hostess' that wanted to get out on time so badly only gave me a $4 discount because that's all she could do and she couldn't find a manager. We paid $200 for some of the worst service I've ever had and I honestly don't even think that should have been paid. I'm so livid beyond belief. My son's birthday was absolutely ruined. The stress free night of doing his party at this establishment was anything but.</Review>< Pictures>

Haven't been here in over 10 years and after being invited to a pizza party we were happy that the place was clean, pizza was good and the kids had a good time. Service was a tad slow and some employees look dead inside but otherwise would return.<//text>

Do not patronize the Dublin Chuck E Cheese. Take your kids to Concord if you want to be treated with respect.

I took my 3 year old son and Mother to the Dublin location and we were treated with an extremely negative atttiude by Ajaya. Her comments were as follows when I asked her for help:

“I’m busy right now”
“We are closed anyway”

I told her that I was sorry for the inconvenience.
She then proceeded to tear up our ticket receipt and refused to help us. I then mentioned to Ajaya that I would be reporting the way she was treating us.

I then asked for help from another employee and as I was speaking to her, Ajaya walks over and says “he said he was going to report me” in a sarcastic tone of voice, she chuckles and walks away.

We were helped by a different employee and left. I told Ajaya that she does not belong working with the public as we left.

Attitude is the number predictor of success. The team members working directly with your customers, have the ability to make or break the business. When you have team members that have negative attitudes serving your customers, this shows a lack of leadership and care for the brand. I will not be returning to Chuck E Cheese in Dublin and will be reposting this on every social media site I have to ensure that everyone I know, friends, family, and connections don’t spend their money at the Dublin Chuck E Cheese.</review>

Staff were very inattentive, with people working at the main order counter simply ignoring customers who were trying to get their attention. The soda area was gross, floors covered in sticky soda goo. Most of the machines were working, surprisingly. Too few announcements were made for the various parties going on, making it impossible to make sure attendees were present for blowing out birthday candles and singing.<//Review>

The kids tend to have fun here but this place is al.ost ALWAYS crowded. And then once in side all the games and food are on the expensive side and when you win tickets, you end up spending about 10x what would be needed to by the prizes outright<//text>

Overall experience was good and kids enjoyed the "Super Mega Star" unlimited games package. But beware, the online package offers may vary from store package. I had booked it online on 6th Jan and upgraded to Super Mega Star on 25th Jan - both done online. When upgrading it showed me that the package includes 9 helium baloons but manager denied saying the parties booked after 8th Jan will get the baloons. I felt cheated because when I upgraded it online on 25th, it showed me the helium baloons listed in it. Manager could have simply honored it to keep things simple but she politely denied since the party was booked on 6th Jan. I would suggest to go to the store and ask them to give it written about their offerings as email doesn't contain any details. Hope it helps!< /Review>< Time>

Went here for a birthday party. Tons of problems to report. 1. They ran out of Pizza dough, so guests went hungry 2. Only 2 out of 8 redeem machines worked 3. Rude staff and a horrible customer service, including their manager. When other hosts complaint​, they said complaint anywhere you want, we don't care! 4. My friend's kid had 74 points left to redeem, he asked for an item with 75 points and the lady said that you run short with one!!!!! So they got another ticket luckily for that point/penny to get that stuff for the kid!!! That lady on the counter kept on making grumpy sounds and faces like Ahhh grr ... And what not.. in front of her manager. Seems they weren't getting paid and forced to work. 5. The guy at the exit, was calling us to move out as it was closed, very rude, as if we were Happy figuring out that single cent with the lady at the counter!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. GOOGLE SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED GIVING THEM 0 POINTS UNFORTUNATELY ONE STAR IS THE LEAST OPTION<//text>

I don't want to leave even one star i was very disappointed in the service given at the party i attended one of the worker's  screamed to the top of her lungs at my 2 year old son to " GET OUT" when the young lady who hosted the party went to the costume room to get chucky  and the other worker thought it was hilarious until they noticed I was standing right there no apologies was given by either girl only from the one who facilitated the party that i was at because she knew that i was bad and ut could have been a ugly situation if i was i more hostile type of parent they complained about the kids spilling dipping dots on the floor that is  sold there I've never experienced such behavior in an establishment that cater to children im definitely not done with this situation</Review>
