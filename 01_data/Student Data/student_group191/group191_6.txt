<user_name>A'sHat SelfieStick<//user_name><text>Compared to other sushi places I have been to priorly, I will say the lighting is rather brighter (therefore less to my liking).  The other sushi places have larger vegetarian menus (the idea of raw meat and fish grosses me out).  I did like the garlic tofu.  Not the best, but I appreciate the provisions of a sushi meal which is quite often just the right amount of food at not too high of a price.</text>< date>

In Marin, this is my place! If I could give them six stars I would! She's always so personable and remembers me. I'll always love those types of businesses over Corporate Faceless Machines. The food is consistently delicious, and the portions are so generous. Great prices for Marin.<//Review>

We ordered ahead and were told there would be a 30 minute wait.  It ended up being an hour.  The cashier was working frantically to keep up.  When we got home with our food we were very happy to find we had 3 large complete meals.  Everything was delicious.  Our family agreed we'd definitely go back there, but we would not have ice cream waiting in the car.<//Text>

Matsuyama a tiny piece of food heaven lives here in this Japanese restaurant!
The owner recognized my husband after years of working in the Novato area & dinning there regularly. We ordered to-go as that is the new normal. We ordered vegetable tempura, (which comes with rice & a house salad) a lunch special bento box which came with two entrées. We chose teriyaki chicken and vegetable tempura.  Hands down the best! So fresh, so yummy. Exactly what we needed. After our order was complete we headed to a park to enjoy our lunch! Oh how I cannot explain how great their tempura is. Can't wait to visit again! Until then, stay well! What a beautiful gem in Novato that has been around for as long as we can both remember! If your thinking 🤔 where should I go? Go here!!!<//text>

Matsuyama is a really unassuming place. It's quiet, and just enough out of the way that you might go by it without realizing. It's not big and fancy, sleek and stylish. It's quite homely, but also very cozy. But in a town that has several Japanese restaurants, Matsuyama has everything going for it.

The menu selection is pretty substantial, a great mix of classic items and their own creations. Their gyoza, in particular, are spot on. They have the special prices at lunchtime, which is a great reason for locals to visit during work, and the portions are always enough that you are getting two meals worth. Even when it comes to the sushi.

Now, one of my great shortcomings in life is that I can't eat sushi. But I can tell a story. I recently visited Matsuyama with a group of people who had never been there before, and many of whom enjoy sushi a lot. Every single one of them was impressed with the quantity and quality of sushi for the price.

Matsuyama's notoriety in town is firmly grounded in its delicious food. Which, you know...for a restaurant is probably a good thing. I say the next time you're feeling like treating yourself to something special, definitely give this a try.< /Text>

All of the food is priced fairly and the portions are generous, without lowering the quality of the food at all.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to families that want to enjoy Japanese food that is not overly expensive but still has the taste of an authentic Japanese restaurant.</text>< pictures>

Great sushi,  great prices.  Limited menu but not tooooo limited. Slow if you're in a hurry but fine otherwise.  There's usually a small staff there and they perhaps get overwhelmed.  But a really decent price for sushi.  I'll be back for sure.<//Text>

Take out service is extremely slow IF you can manage to reach them on the phone. They are using and old cordless phone and the batteries run out frequently...so sometimes hours go by before they realize the phone is off the charger... Regardless, we find this place charming.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Love it. Tastes really good, nice place to go in town. All their specialty rolls all really good, I don't really order anything else so I don't know about the rest but I'd assume it's great!<//Review>

<Review>Might be one of the cheapest Japanese food places in Marin, but so is the taste. Had ramen and udon and kind of flavorless. They were working on some big pick up order and made us wait for 1 hr. The waiter was excellent though. The two stars were for him.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Okay, I used to like this place as it was pretty cheap and the food was decent (usually a little on the greasy side - and I don't recommend the sushi). But lately their prices went up, but I think the quality went down. Too bad.<//text>

This place lost one star due to the spotty service the last couple times we went.  The food is good and the price is very reasonable and the people are very nice but the food is coming out in odd intervals and the wait just to order is way too long. Not sure what's happening there ...</review>

Worst "Japanese" restaurant ive ever been to.... we were scared to eat the food so we left it .... absolutely disgusting! ive had better sushi off a taco truck.  Huge waste of money.... people in Novato must not have any taste buds.<//text>

Usually when I go to a Japanese restaurant, I try out their katsudon. This place had some of the best and cheapest katsudon I've had in North Bay. They interestingly added a few pickles, which I had never seen before in katsudon, but they added a nice touch to the dish. The waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. None of my other friends seemed to think the place was all that special, so maybe I just happened to order the right thing?<//Text>

Waited 10 minutes outside for them to open. Jokingly said wow didn't think you would open Waited 25 minutes for my take out order. They were rude unkind to keep me waiting and the food was very bad Cannot compare to my favorites in San Francisco. Will never go back.Was in.< /Text>

I celebrated my graduation yesterday in this gorgeous place. happy to tell that we passed a sensational evening and the restaurant was clearly the reason for that happy gathering. The stuff  helped in a lovely way, the food was extremely good and my guests were extremely  glad. We shall definitely visit again for more celebrations. thanks very much.</text>

My husband and I have learned in our travels... that the best places to eat are not always the most popular. Last night we had one of the best meals ever... at a small local Aptos restaurant called the Sparrow Cafe... My husband had (melt in your mouth)Venison with a cherry reduction sauce. (It was one of the dinner specials) and I had scallops with capellini with a pink pepper corn sauce... the food was cooked to perfection...  it's a small quaint restaurant a bit pricey, but well worth it... the dessert menu was terrific also... they even had petite desserts...   so if you are in Aptos check it out, you won't be sorry.<//Review>

< Review>
I've been coming here for years (my parents live right down the street), and have always experienced high-quality food and service. About 10 years ago I hosted a dinner to celebrate my parents' 25-year anniversary. My last visit this May was no different. Unfailingly kind and professional staff. Delicious food: We had 3 appetizers, 5 entrees and 2 desserts, all wonderful. Notable is the fettuccine with filet tips and the venison special. My elderly mom's original pasta dish had too much garlic for her taste and the server graciously insisted on bringing another of the same dish. Then the chef came out to make sure it was to her liking. Very much appreciated. I've always loved the location and interior of this restaurant. Highly recommend!<//Review>

<Review>Cafe Sparrow has an unassuming store front, but the atmosphere inside is elegant and welcoming.  It has a long record of dedication to quality dishes and fresh food.  The menu changes daily and they always offer a variety that includes something for everyone. They are renowned for their pork chops, but the fish and beef prep is on par. Sparrow also offers an interesting variety of wines. The French influence is present in every aspect. This is my go to for special occasions and one of the best restaurants in the bay area.< /Review>< user>

<review>The sauce with my wife's salmon was incredible and I had a perfectly cooked duck breast. We had the pork belly appetizer, and it was amazing- the right amount of meatiness, with great balance of sweet and touch of balsamic- even with how seemingly overused pork belly is these days, it was a delight. The atmosphere is nice but comfortable, great for a special occasion without being uptight.< /review></record>

Me, my wife and two close friends went to Cafe Sparrow for Sunday brunch after a round of golf.  We have eaten here several times for dinner and it's never disappointed us; until now.  We all ordered different dishes, and the other three ordered the bottomless mimosas and I had coffee.  Drinks came out immediately, but the food took just about an hour.  Not sure what happened, but nevertheless, when it arrived, it was one order short; mine.  This stuff  happens, I get it, but how professional this issue is handled, speaks to the establishments customer service, or the lack there of.  Our server said my order was coming, but didn't make it out for another 15-20 minutes.  Everyone around the table tried to wait, but when their food started to get cold, they ate.  After my food did arrive, the server said, "well, I guess maybe I never placed your order".  It's too bad that the poor service we received overshadowed how good my meal was.  Pretty disappointed brunch.</text>

<text>Very nice atmosphere, women's restaurant. Salads variety large enough for sharing. The view sadly of the ocean growing in. Many variety of dishes, I had a Reuben sandwich I suppose something for a man , but cheesy for two women to share. Beautiful crowd and service.< /text>< rating>

I hate to admit it, but I'm a foodie. And this place is off the charts good. I sometimes don't like rating great places, because I don't want the place to get too popular. But the owners are such great people, I don't want to deny them their praise. On top of great food, the service is equally good. I've eaten at all the good places in the Santa Cruz area, and this is the best without question.</review>

Charming cafe, casual, welcoming, ... prices a bit upscale, but you get what you pay for.  Delicious food.  Reviews said French, but I've found a good variety of food, including many favorites.  Excellent service.  Every now and then, give yourself a treat.< /Review>

Now that the traditional tourist season is over, we were able to drive right up in front and walk right to a lovely table! The wait staff is so attentive and helpful! And then comes the delicious food! I opted for crab cake benedict and yes, it was real crab , with homemade  delicious Hollandaise sauce! We opted for the endless mimosas and were not hurried through our meal at all! I love this place! I have been there several times for dinner, but this was the first time for Sunday brunch! I will return!</Text>

The ambiance was friendly, quiet, and warm. The decor was eclectic and fun. I recommend the crab Benedict on a croissant. It was delicious! The potatoes however, were overcooked and had way too much paprika. The service was average.<//review>

Very cute place.  Some dishes were fantastic, some good enough but not memorable.  They have a little dessert menu, and I thought that was adorable.  I got creme brulee, which was perfect.  Just the right amount and classic.</review>

Their pancakes are gluten free and definitely worth the stop, especially as there are multiple flavors to choose from daily. They also feature a chicken saugage of the day and many daily specials.

< Review>
Went for breakfast and found that the place has a nice decor, however it is way over priced! Way way over priced! Also I ordered eggs, potatoes and toast. Eggs were great, all two of them, potatoes were burnt to the point that they were not recognizable. I never received toast, just a piece of sourdough roll. This is a little my fault in that I should have sent it back. I did not as my kids were embarrassed.</Review>

I wish I could make a Review with out having to put a star. Never have I even been treated so badly at the restaurant!! I Went with my mother for her birthday dinner. It comes once a year and I thought that I would take my mom to a nice place. First we got our drinks and the lady taking our orders demanded that i wasn't over the age of 21, Even after seeing my Drivers License!!! Then we got our food!!!! The second I cut into my felt witch was supposed to be medium well it just oozed blood. The waitress came over to check on the food and when I told her it wasn't cook how i asked she automatically told me that I must of not told her how I wanted the meat cooked. When my whole party I was with told her I did she finally took it back to the kitchen. When it came back out it wasn't fixed it was just burnt on the top so bad it was hard to eat but yet the meat was still as red and if the cow was breathing!!!! My party had finished there when I was still waiting for mine to come back from the kitchen. After a few mine the head cook came out and asked how everything was After telling him what had happened he reached over the table and ripped the dish out of my hands!!! The next thing that happened is why I am writing this review! He told me " Sorry it's not your liking ". sir I paid $340.69 for dinner that night sorry I wanted to eat dinner but wasn't able to!!! I went home hungry on my mothers birthday after I paid for dinner. I will not make the mistake again. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!<//Review>

Excellent food--at least the salad I had was. Fresh greens and tomatoes with polenta that was slightly crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, all with a tasty vinaigrette. Decor is charming with lots of light. Will definitely go back. The food in many restaurants is so bland and mediocre. Cafe Sparrow is a welcome change.<//Review>

<Review>We stopped in Cafe Sparrow on a weekday afternoon after my wife found it on the net while driving from San Diego to San Francisco.  It turned out to be a fantastic experience.  Starting with the wine, then I have to mention the great service and last to mention but not least was the food.  Oh, the atmosphere, and the friendly feeling given off by other diners was great too.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed in anything at Cafe Sparrow.  We would be regulars if we didn't live in Hollywood, Florida.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808e1678641b0bd7:0xd6a89c2295285f6< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Lovely food. Service was very slow which isn't a problem unless you are in a hurry. The decorations aren't very contemporary: lots of dried flowers, woven baskets and draped fabric. Great apps and desserts. Specials are a must.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Some of the greatest country French I've ever had. Aubry is an extraordinary chef.  Wine list is adequate, I bring my family here often.  I've always totally enjoyed the atmosphere, the simple relaxing decor, the cleanliness, freshness of the food and it's perfect preparation.  My whole family loves this place.  Cost is beyond reasonable.
I highly recommend Cafe Sparrow.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

So amazing! Everything is made in house. Brunch on Sunday is a must and definitely upgrade to a homemade croissant.</Text>

The food here was amazing! The decor was reminiscent of a grandmother's house, with pastels and lace - not my favorite - but the meal we had was extraordinary. I particularly liked the butternut squash soup as a starter. Everything on the menu sounded tasty.<//Review>

Lovely restaurant for lunch and dinner. It's a "special night" kind of place, with excellent food and wine, pleasant atmosphere, and great customer service attitude. We would dine here a lot more often if we lived closer -- it's about 45 minutes each way for us.<//Review>

<text>A special occasion made better

My wife and I returned to Cafe Sparrow in celebration of our wedding anniversary. It turned out to be a candlelight dinner via mother nature. The electrical power went out while we were enjoying out starters. The staff didn’t miss a beat, as extra candles were brought to the tables. The full house of patrons were at ease and all appeared to enjoy the experience.

This is probably our 6th visit to Cafe Sparrow in the past 4 years, and we have not been disappointed. I had the Chicken livers, which were prepared with apples, bacon, and garlic, without any of the condiments being overwhelming, and mixing nicely with the chicken liver. My wife had the special risotto with beef dish. We paired these with a Zinfandel from their wine list, and sat back and enjoyed a wonderful evening.
Even under the handicap of no power, the kitchen was able to provide their wonderful desserts.

This will be an evening that we will remember for quite some time.....</text>< Name>

Great ambiance and awesome food!  The regular menu has some favorites like the pepper steak or the Ahi salad.  Then they also have daily specials to choose from.  Very good wine selection as well.  They can get busy so I reccomend reservations.</text>

The food isn't that amazing (sausage and eggs were undercooked and the potatoes were cold) but it's a good environment. A small glass of orange juice is about the size of a thimble ($3.50) and the large ($4.75) is maybe a square inch more.< /text>

<Review>Cafe sparrow is now my favorite restaurant in the Santa Cruz area. The service is amazing: the busser is super attentive, the servers and chef who walk around are very friendly and helpful with choosing what to eat/drink. Overall, the food speaks for itself. I’m usually unenthusiastic about going to hyped-up restaurants because I feel like they rely heavily on ambience and their reputation alone. This isn’t the case here. The food is high quality, delicious, and reasonably priced. The salmon here is the best I’ve ever had. We also enjoyed the ahi tuna appetizer, scallops, and filet mignon (you can cut it with a butter knife). The desserts and wine list are also unreal. Thanks for a killer dinner!</Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Always consistent tastey. Filet Mignon, cooked beets, butternut squash and small salad has been my go to years. A glass of Fence Post Cab completes the meal. Never a bad experience, top-quality servers and an owner that walks the floor nightly. Wonderful place, the single bad review is an anomaly.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Without a rez, they still seated us quickly in the middle of Friday dinner rush. Service was great and the food was mostly amazing. Ahi was very good. The scallops and polenta were a little blah but all in all this was a very positive dinner experience!</Review>

We absolutely love this place - the appetizers, meals, wine are all terrific. The kitchen is small, and they not only beautifully prepare food, they accommodate small modifications with pleasure.< /Text>

<username>Tuco's Child</username><time>1405234873517<//time><rate>2<//rate><review>Arrogant and incredibly rude owner. Overpriced, overrated, slow service, good food..... Take your hard earned money somewhere else.

Here is the story, almost unbelievable, sad but true:

Made 5:30 reservation. Arrived promptly. Appetizers and drinks arrived in a timely manner. Appetizer was roasted garlic which was good. My Caesar salad was drenched in dressing, but still tasty.

50 minutes into the meal, became concerned about the entrees arrival. Expressed my concern to waitress, and I was told " oh, you should have told me you needed to leave so soon" (Evidently, I incorrectly thought that 1 hr and 15 minutes was enough time for a meal with a very early reservation and only 3 other tables seated!)

My immediate thought was "she forgot to put in our ticket, or the kitchen is backed up"

1 hr and 5 minutes after prompt arrival, still no entree, so, we had to leave because I was taking my 10 year daughter to a movie on our special night out. No way to enjoy entrée at this late juncture.

Interestingly, and surprising to me, I was told by wait person later "we usually allow 1 hr 45 minutes per couple." If this was Le Cirque, Le Bernardin, or the French Laundry, I guess that would be the norm, but this is a casual venue in sleepy Aptos. Really!

Here is the interesting part: I did share with owner Bob M. over the phone that I was very displeased, I was edgy, but not rude or vicious, - his response, literally: "we are not a fast food restaurant, for that go to Jack in the Box." I was almost speechless, but pressed on. Bob the owner's parting shots were "you are wrong" and "Enjoy your meal tonight at Jack in the Box" All this witnessed by my 10 year old daughter! Pathetic really. Thanks for the lesson in customer service, Bob. We appreciate it.

The good news: we made it to the movie on time and ate popcorn for our entree and enjoyed the flick. Never made it to Jack in the Box, but, I can guarantee you; we would rather have a taco there than ever eat again at Café Sparrow .< /review>< Pics>

Nice owner was a big help with getting my Tahoe smogged!  There were 2 people in line before me but it went very quick and I moved into line in less than 30 minutes. I recommend this place and you can get a coupon online for a discount for an added bonus.< /text>

I live right next door and figured I come here since I usually get gas too. After actually talking to the guy he seemed to be bothered to help, and then asked me to hurry cause he had another guy waiting. Sorry if my business was such an inconvenience. Go else where, they just lost a loyal customer since I’ve lived in azusa all my life.<//Review>< userid>

Yummy food,  but service is so so. I like this plaza’s outside seating. After we ordered, we sit comfortably outdoors and enjoy our delicious goodies!! It’s next to Bakery 101, so we also got their awesome cheesecakes and tres leches cakes to complete a great afternoon😋<//Text>

This place is horrible .  It doesn't even worth 1 star. -0 best rate . I just wasted my money on a ice cream that is  very guey. My daughter had stomach  sick after enjoyed it. The ice cream taste like one made week before. Not right</Review>

Its real small in there and extremely crowded. Services is good and polite but when I ordered my usual I noticed they were being skimpy and using cheap products plus fillers. Corona's location has the right concept going and i truly dislike that City.<//Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Seriously, delicious!! I picked up 3 ice cream sandwiches: cookies & cream, banana dulce de leche almond (which I was afraid of trying being that the guy said it has a strong banana taste but choose anyway due to the long line), and mint crunch. THEY ALL WERE GREAT!!! The macaroons taste like brownies, they are chewy and soft. I usually hate macaroons due to them being over sweetened or having a floral taste but La Michoacana Ice Cream has given me hope! The one that I was most afraid of surprisingly is my fav, the banana dulce de leche almond. The almond adds a nice palette cleanse element and switches up the flavor so that there isn't so much banana. So good!!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>104776770210289043963< /UserId.>< Response>

(Translated by Google) If you intend to buy a two-flavored ice cream for young children, you should know that in this place you have to buy a giant waffle with two diabetes balls because they cannot sell you a simple one. Put batteries and have a small presentation they sell us giant scoop ice cream that does not allow you to taste two or three different flavors.
An ice cream like this is like for two people 😂🍦 I couldn't finish it and in the trash I finished half 😝

(Original)
Si pretendes comprarle un helado de dos sabores a los niños pequeños debes saber que en este lugar tienes que comprar a la de a huevo un barquillo gigante con dos bolotas marca diabetes porque no te pueden vender uno sencillo. Pónganse pilas y tengan presentación pequeña nos venden helado de bola gigantes que no te permiten probar dos o tres sabores distintos.
Uno helado como este es como para dos personas 😂🍦yo no pude terminarmelo y en la basura terminó la mitad 😝<//text>

(Translated by Google) The truth does not deserve any star this place, the atmosphere that is felt in this place is very unpleasant with the lady who has treated me. I asked him for an esquite with cheetos, but then they change my opion because my daughter can not eat chile, she gets angry and I feel a bad face. I served the esquite thus with what I asked him and he gave it to me in half! Everything they sell here is very delicious but with the attitude and bad charisma that reflects the lord lost another consumer more. Even if it's a smile on your face, it would change everything but nothing. If I recommend the place but have to dismiss the lady with her bad attitude, bad charisma, and the unmotivated to be to continue in this beautiful company!

(Original)
La verdad no se merese ninguna estrella este lugar, el ambiente que se siente en este lugar es muy desagradable con la señora que me a  atendido. Le pedi un esquite con cheetos, pero luego cambien mi opion porque mi hija no puede comer chile, se enojo y me iso una mala cara. Me sirvio el esquite asi nomas con lo que le pedi y me lo dio a la mitad! Todo lo que venden aqui es muy delicioso pero con la actitud y el mal carisma que refleja la señor perdio otro consumidor mas. Aunque sea una sonrisa en su cara cambiaria todo pero nada. Si les recomiendo el lugar pero deveran despedir a la señora con por su mala actitud, mal carisma, y la unmotivada que estar para seguir en esta hermosa compania!< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I really had heard many good comments from that paleteria but in reality very bad service and very little for what you pay I think I would never recommend this place and much less regress, very bad customer service I think they should change the staff with that character I should not be attending, send them to sleep at your house or be on the phone, which I think is the only thing that that person serves, where really if I recommend it is exquisite

(Original)
De verdad abia escuchado muchos buenos comentarios de esa paleteria pero en realidad pesimo servicio y muy poco por lo que uno paga creo que yo jamas rrecomendaria este lugar y mucho menos rregresaria, muy mal servicio al cliente creo que deberían cambiar el personal jente con ese caracter no debería estar atendiendo mandenlos a dormir a su casa o a estar en el telefono que creo que es para lo unico que sirve esa jente, donde deverdad si recomiendo es exquisitos< /text>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) What he sells in this place is a little unpleasant, I don't know if he belongs to the chain that really is La Michocana Premium, because they don't sell things with the same consistency and flavor compared to those in Warner, 1st, and tustin's . I was entrusted to look for the snows that I buy in the other stores very when the girl who attended me told me that she did not have the types of flavors that I asked for. So if they are not going to have what the others have, take the name off and stop cheating on the people, and stop discrediting the royal Michocana Premium.

(Original)
Lo que vende en este lugar es un poco desagradable,no se si pertenezca ala cadena que realmente es La Michocana Premium, porque no venden las cosas con la misma consistencia y sabor a comparación de las que están en Warner,1st, y la de tustin. Fui confiado a buscar las nieves de que compro en las demás tiendas muy cuando llegó la chava que me atendía me desia que no tenía los tipos de sabores que yo le pedía. Soo  si no van a tener lo que las demás tiene quitense  el nombre y dejen de handar engañando ala jente, y dejar de desprestigiar ala real Michocana Premium.</text>

I was helped by two guys, both named Noah. They were absolutely awesome! They saved me a bunch of money by telling me the truth of some things that a different mechanic told me was wrong with my car but actually weren’t. They saved me a bunch of money and gave me a lot of extra useful information that they didn’t have to give me. They also made me have a relaxed, fun experience that genuinely made my day better. I will definitely be coming back for these guys and will be recommending them to my roommates and friends. They did an amazing job for me today!</Review>

Fastest, friendliest and most affordable place in town! I’ll never go to another oil change company after the great service I had today!! Was in and out fast, they fixed an overfilled tire (ugh, thanks Les Schwab) that was unsafe and even gave me a free car wash. :)</Review>

I use to come here all the time. Great service great job. Whelp NOT anymore! Time to find a new lube place. Ugh they tried to trick me into buying high mileage oil like literally trick me after I said no they even charged me for high mile oil and they didn't offer me a stinking car wash.</review>

Very Poor quality service, skid plate fell off half way home after getting my oil changed. When I took it back to them, they blamed it on me saying my skid plate was missing bolts and clips, even though my car is brand new and this was its first oil change. Highly do not recommend< /text>

<Text>28 June 2020: John and Josh were great. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. I don’t understand how they don’t have a higher rating, because they should. I have got my oil changed at a few other places around chico (who have higher ratings), but this is the best place I’ve been to yet. I called to make sure the internet posting was correct and they were actually open, and yes- they were the only oil change location open on a Sunday. They said they were short staffed but would get me in. As soon as I arrived, and before I could park, they directed me into an open bay to get me started. I asked for an oil change. Josh immediately showed me that my oil was still good and did not need to be changed yet. I had got it changed 5,000 miles earlier with synthetic. He said I can easily go another 1,000 miles since most synthetics are made to be changed out every 6,000 miles. I thanked them for not trying to up-sell me. They said they would rather be honest now and have me come back as repeat business later. I’ll definitely come back. Although I didn’t get the oil changed, they still checked all my fluids, topped them off where necessary... and then even gave me a free car wash. Talk about your local place being honest and taking care of their patrons. I’ve never written a review before, but I had to after what happened today. Thanks again to John and Josh!< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x80832896419bdf4d:0xe0837ef53944b440<//gmapID>< response>

<text>Had the oil changed in my 2007 Prius. Immediately after the oil change, the car refused to run. Got the "red triangle of death" on the display. I had one of the pro-lube staff help me check the oil level and he verified that the oil had been overfilled. He removed some oil to bring the level down to the full line. The car still refused to start. I had the car towed to my mechanic who found that the problem was likely because of the overfilled oil. Apparently, this is a common problem on the generation II Prius. I returned to pro lube with my invoice for $122 from my mechanic and suggested that they take some responsibility for the mistake. The employee said he would contact his "big guy" and that his "big guy" would get back to me. Four days later and no word.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>These men are so honest. I got the best synthetic oil and I kept coming back to get my oil changed again after quite some time but they wouldn't do it because they said I didn't need it, checked it check my tires gave me free car washes then finally on my third time back in they changed it because it was finally needed.

A joke. Guys here are rude, extremely slow, and will try and sell you plenty you don't need. Usually use Lube Express but was on that side of town so I figured I would give them a try. SUPER DISAPPOINTED in both customer service and quality of work. I def will not be back.< /Review>

They are fast, but don't expect to leave with the quoted price.  I had a coupon that quoted an oil change for $29.95.  When I was finished, my charge was $42.65 and that was after they took off $7.00 for my coupon.  I was charged $5.00 for my oil filter and $5.59 for additional oil, plus tax of $2.07.  I was not advised of these charges until after the service was completed.
I just don't believe I was treated ethically.</review>

These guys took and look at it, filled up my fluid levels and sent me on my way for the grand total of 0 dollars. All of this was done while treating me with respect and a great attitude. It was the best demonstration of good business I have seen in a long time and I felt compelled to write this review. If and when I'm in the area again, Pro Lube is the only place I would consider taking my car. Side note. When I arrived my oil cap had not been put back on since the last time oil was added. I blamed my wife, but it was actually my fault. I'm a dumb ass.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Could've been a bit faster, but fair price, be sure to be ask them to reset your oil change warning light because they generally will space it otherwise..< /Review>

< review>
When I drove out to CA two years I was told that the air conditioner pulley was going bad... but it was not an immediate issue or anything to worry about.. would cost $400 to fix.. So I waited.

While getting an oil change here in CA I was told the same thing again.

I waited.

We take off yesterday and get down the hill, as we say, and all of a sudden I lost my power steering and the car is over heating, just before we reached the edge of Chico

The place that I had my oil changed was just up the road by about three blocks.

We have less then 30 min to get an appointment

We pull into Pro-Lube and the tech comes out and I tell him what happened and also say we have to get to an appointment..

He pops the hood and sure enough the pulley is gone and the serpentine belt is off of all the other pulleys that cool the engine and do what ever they are suppose to do...

He goes right to work.. In the mean time we call a taxi to pick us up.... the tech calls ORiely's orders the pulley, he meets the delivery girl in the parking lot puts the pulley on and the belt and has us done in 10 mins!!

Never have I seen a repair job go so fast...

He charges me the whole total of ...

$24.99 just the cost of the part!!!

As we are getting in the car the taxi pulls up and he goes over and takes care of that for us.

And we made it to the DR's office with 10 min. to spare!

And he told us as an extra bonus that whenever they do any service work they always include a free car wash. He says come back any time and he will remember us

Guess where we will always be getting our oil changed from now on??

It was a complete blessing from God that that was the perfect location for it to happen, that I actual knew where to go, that I had used them in the past and this tech was there...</review>

As a family we all get our oil changes here. As well before a road trip we stop in and they check fluid levels and tire pressure at no charge. Friendly and professional every time.< /review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>While I am sure that Dr. Leo Yang is not the cheapest dentist in the area, they do accept Delta Dental and Delta's pricing structure.

More importantly is the quality of work performed by Dr. Yang and the professionalism, yet very friendly service of the staff.

I had to have a molar removed and in less than an hour it was removed, the pocket cleaned out and a bone graft inserted.  Dr. Yang explained in detail exactly what he was going to do beforehand.  Upon completion, he explained exactly what he did.  The fact that both explanations were the same lends me to believe he did his homework before going in.  I like that.

I would highly recommend Dr. Yang.<//text>< Pictures>

You are lucky if this is your dentist! When I am “in the chair” having dental work done, I have total confidence in Dr. Yang’s knowledge and skill. He has the latest dental equipment for the fastest and best possible treatment, and his certificates indicate he takes continuing education seriously. You won’t find a more pleasant office, set among bay and redwood trees for the patient to enjoy while having work done. Free parking in the building is a plus. The staff is efficient and welcoming, including the hygienist. I like that Dr. Yang fully explains treatment options to me and then gives me a written treatment plan and cost summary in advance of having the work done. I no longer live in Marin County but travel back when I need dental care, because I am lucky to have found this dentist.</text>

I might be the only person who likes to go to the dentist. Dr Yang always has the most friendly and professional staff. His cleaning hygienist, Susan, is absolutely fantastic. She’s thorough, she’s gentle and she always lets me know how I can do a little bit better job of taking care of my teeth without blame. I feel very lucky to have this team.</Text>

Ever since switching dentists to Dr. Yang I finally look forward to going to the dentist. He's professional, personable, and his staff is lovely. He's also thorough, yet quick. You're in and out.. with a smile (that's cleaner/better than when you arrived). He just fixed an old filling and it was painless, fast, and really well done. Dr. Yang goes above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable, informed (will answer any question + showed me pictures of the filling before, during, and after), and happy with the results. I also love his office...it's so nice to look up into the big windows and watch the clouds float by while you're getting your teeth cleaned or a procedure done. They also always have good music playing, adding to the unparalleled ambiance (for a dental office). Big thanks to Dr. Yang and his amazing team! I would recommend them to anyone and everyone!</Review>

<review>I came to Dr. Yang’s office referred by a very close friend who has been a patient there for over 3 years now. She would always speak highly of Dr. Yang and his staff. I came in for a consultation regarding some potential cosmetic work I want to accomplish in the near future. When I came in, I was greeted by the 2 front desk ladies who were very friendly. Dr. Yang and his assistants were very kind as well and made me feel welcomed. Dr. Yang was very detailed in explaining my treatment options based on my dental needs and concerns. Dr. Yang has state of the art technology in his office. He explained he can do veneers on the same day as well. I highly recommend Dr. Yang and his staff if you are looking for great dental care from start to finish. Thank you everyone I will definitely be back in the future.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1619078586154, 'text': 'Always nice to see you, Rosa and thank you for the recommendation!'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x8085900b7e93f463:0xcff2d6630367e49c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Drs. Yang and his team were amazing. First visit as I just relocated from Europe. I have a lot of anxiety going to the Dentist and Drs. Yang was patient and extremely thorough in his examination and in explaining my options based on what I want to achieve and he made me feel relaxed. He also did not make me feel bad or ashamed for neglecting my dental care due to anxiety. On the contrary her reassured me and let me know what steps to take to get back on track over time. They have the latest technology so that you can visualize expected results and did I mention the staff... they are all wonderful. Gloria and the DA (forgot her name sorry), were very kind and helpful.  I highly recommend!< /Text>< UserId.>

<user_name>Brigette Thomas<//user_name><text>If you need veneers, get ‘em here!
I had been waiting for years to get my front teeth fixed that were chipped and ground down. I had even started smiling differently to compensate for the fact that I didn’t like my smile. I finally decided to jump in and asked Dr. Yang to help me!

I didn’t really know what to expect. I knew that at least my smile would be whiter and the teeth elongated. Boy was I surprised! The results are AMAZING. I honestly can’t believe it every time I see them. They are beautifully long, white, natural and translucent like real teeth (porcelain). It has completely changed my face.

The process was easy and made me very comfortable. We started with a consultation, where Dr. Yang gave me his opinion on what I could have done and an estimate of costs. He recommended I get veneers on the four front teeth when other dentists tried to sell me on redoing my entire upper row of teeth for an exorbitant price! When I decided to move forward, scans of my teeth were taken and sent off to create a model of the recommended augmentation. In the meantime, I was whitening the rest of my teeth so we could get them as white as possible when matching the veneer color at the end. When the digital model was ready, I went in to see it and we made some adjustments so it was to my liking. Then it was sent off to make an actual physical model that would help them to fit the veneers.

Now for the big day! Dr. Yang sets it up so you can have the veneers done in one day when other dentists have you come in once for temporaries and then again for the permanent ones. In the morning, my gums were lasered to help further elongate the teeth and even up my gum line. Wow did that make a difference. Then my teeth were prepped for the veneers. Temporary teeth were popped in and I was free to leave for a few hours and have lunch and get some work done. Then back in the afternoon for the final veneers to be added. Dr. Yang had flown in the specialist who makes the veneers so he was on site. The two of them worked together to perfect the teeth. So much attention to detail!! And then just like that, I was done! Easy peasy!

As I said, the results are amazing. I opted to not tell my friends to see if anyone noticed. I could see they were looking at my face to figure out what had changed. The teeth look so natural that no one was able to tell until I told them! I’ve gotten loads of compliments from them. I noticed that I smile bigger and have even more confidence in my appearance. I had been waiting for years to get the veneers done because they aren’t generally covered by insurance. But of course as soon as I had them done, I wished I had done it years ago!!!

If you’re thinking of doing it, bite the bullet and contact Dr. Yang. You will thank me for it!!</text>< time>

<review>Dr. Yang and his staff are wonderful!  I was referred by my boyfriend who has been a patient for over 16 years; and I have been a patient for the last four (4) years.  Gloria and Sierra are so accommodating and knowledgeable, whenever I have questions about my insurance Gloria is on top of it.  I always have confidence in the billing process.  Sierra is always available for questions on anything, I always ask for something and she is always there to help me out.  Taren is so personable and takes care of my pearly whites, always helping me with my sensitive areas.   Dr. Yang is top notch.  He has come in on the weekend to help me with my snaggle tooth.  I had a botched root canal done a long time ago and Dr. Yang fixed it.  It took a few tries to get the right fit, but he was patient and worked with me.  I truly love going in to see everyone. Thank you for all you do :) !</review><name>Jaime Fisher</name><resp>{'time': 1619078657298, 'text': 'Thanks Jaime, I am glad the whole team took care of you.

I read great reviews saying Dr Yang was good working with patients who are nervous and they were completely right. With my cleaning, he knew when I was starting to get really anxious. I think he reads body language really well because at those moments he would stop and ask me questions about my school and career. I later came back to get my filling replaced on two teeth. I was super nervous but they provided laughing gas for me. Yes, I cried a few times during the procedure when my anxiety got overwhelming but no one made me feel like I was overreacting or dramatic. They just kept reassuring me and telling me to to take deep breaths. They even put a blanket over my legs so I wouldn’t be chilly. I have nothing but good things to say. I need have another filling done but I feel loads better knowing I’ll be coming back to Dr. Yang. Thank you!!<//Text>< date>

I didn't take the best care of my teeth as a child and Dr. Yang has helped me to maintain healthy teeth and gums. I recommend them to anyone looking for a dentist!<//text>< username>

Life changing... that is the only way I would describe my experience with Dr. Yang and his amazing Team.

The decision to get a smile makeover was not something that I approached lightly, from my first appointment with Dr. Yang I knew that my extensive research had paid off.

In talking to Dr. Yang it is very apparent that not only is he a perfectionist when it comes to his work, but perhaps just as importantly, creating these transformative moments for his patients is truly his passion. And due to his adoption of the latest technology in dental care, he’s able to deliver a smile makeover in a single day! There’s a ton of work that goes into it, but as a patient you aren’t aware of all of the magic happening behind the scenes.

And his team, his incredible team!! I really can’t say enough about how amazing they are, Amily was so kind and helpful while walking me through the insurance process. She’s just a really nice person! Sierra was so knowledgeable about the smile makeover process and an invaluable resource (ty again for your advice Sierra!). Gloria, always welcomed me like a friend when I arrived! Everyone else is amazing too! The overall vibe of the office is so friendly and caring. I realize it sounds kind of weird to say you’d like to hang out at your dentists office, but that’s how I feel lol

Ok, now back to the same day smile! I was slightly nervous ahead of the big day, but as soon as the process started my anxiety faded away. Dr Yang was amazing! I literally didn’t feel a thing!! He and Sean are such perfectionists, in my mind they truly are artists. Sierra is as well. I still cannot believe the amazing transformation that occurred- and that it all occurred in a single day? Mind blowing. I feel so grateful Dr. Yang and team, they truly changed my life.< /text>

I love Dr. Yang and his office. I went to them on a recommendation and I knew I made the right choice as soon as I met Dr. Yang.  I went to him for a specific tooth problem and he gave me all of the options to fix it. I don't like dentists and have always avoided them - but they took care of me and were thorough and professional and I have never been happier. My teeth and mouth feel great and look great.</Text>

I’ve been avoiding the dentist since I was a kid unless absolutely necessary. I hate the dentist, most of the time they don’t care to explain what they are doing or what their next steps are, they just shove the needle in to numb you and get upset when you ask them to stop pushing or prodding because you think you feel pain.  Dr. Yang explained everything step by step even took a picture of the tooth to show me exactly what he was seeing so I could get a better understanding of what was happening to my tooth and what he was going to do. The numbing shots are why I hated needles for half of my life. But Dr. Yang has figured out a way to make it the least painful process I have ever had! He was patient and perfect! Thank you! 100% will recommend!< /Review>

I recently found Dr. Yang & Lee through a web search, after moving to Marin County a few weeks ago. I had a filling fall out during my move and needed to get in asap to have it repaired. My experience with the office was wonderful and super friendly from first point of contact, and I was in for an appt with Dr. Yang promptly. Dr. Yang was impressive with his demeanor, warmth, and clear and thorough communication. He gave me my options and let me decide how I wanted to move forward with my procedure. This was a first for me with a dentist!! I felt 100% safe and comfortable, in good hands. My filling procedure was pain free and fast and I felt a part of and included the whole time. I am so happy with the results, and plan on returning to Dr’s. Yang & Lee for all of my dental needs. Thank you!< /Review>

So I was in need of a new dentist after not having been in a quite a while, and needing some work done. After reading the the reviews on Dr. yang and his staff I made the decision to set up an appointment. Gloria was amazing and got back to me very quickly and made everything very accommodating with my work schedule. The staff is all beyond wonderful and kind.

<Name>Terrace Wong</Name><text>Dr. Leo Yang is a great dentist and has earned my trust. Before visiting Dr. Yang, I was in pain for over a year, visited a few dentists, but only Dr. Yang has spent the most time to preform a detail diagnostic and advised me that my tooth had a fine crack on it. Then he presented me with a few scenarios and courses of action; after all, he fixed my tooth.

Dr. Yang is detail, genuine, and very intelligent. He treat me with respect by always talking to me and making sure that I understand his message, nicely. His ability to diagnose dental issue and presentation of solution are superb.

Every visit to Dr. Yang's dental clinic is like visiting friends. Gloria, at the front desk would greet me like her friend, so would Josh, Sierra, and Dr. Yang himself would all greet me by my first name  and with a happy smile.

Maybe looking forward to visit a dentist isn't normal, but I do look forward to visit to Dr. Yang's dental clinic.<//text><rating>5</rating></record></dataset><record>

I have been seeing Dr. Yang for the past 8 years for all my dental afflictions. About 6 years ago, we moved to Sonoma County but after trying another dentist locally, we decided that it was worth it in every aspect to continue seeing Dr. Yang even it meant a sometimes 90 minute drive each way. He is extremely professional, on the cutting edge in terms of dental technology and is always smiling and in a great mood. His staff are very friendly and know what they are doing.  His investment in 3D X-ray technology takes the guesswork out of dentistry as he is able to see what is at the root of the problem and can therefore, provide a logical path to correct it.  I can't recommend him and the rest of the team highly enough!<//Review>

<text>This review is long overdue. Sorry... :) Drs Yang & Lee have been my dentists for a long time. I have had my share of dental work - fillings, root canals, implant and crowns.

Dr Yang is a "wizard" of a dentist. He is highly professional, more of a perfectionist I must say. He is very dedicated to his job and the level of service he provides to his patients is superb ! He is always up to date with all the latest technology/equipment and thoroughly explain the steps and procedures in details. He will also explain different options for your dental care and provide the best not being 'pushy' at all.

I have great confidence in his team/staff. They are very welcoming and very professional, efficient and friendly. The office has a calm and relaxing environment which will take away the fear and anxiety in you.

Drs Yang & Lee will be my dentists forever and I highly, highly recommend to everyone. A definite 5 ***** !< /text>< GmapID>

I am so grateful to Dr. Yang and his entire team for the recent professional and incredibly efficient work to replace an old crown (he makes the new crowns there on the spot so its all taken care of in one visit!) as well as all the care my family and I have received over the years. They have been especially wonderful in accommodating both emergency calls, and my son's college schedule, as needed. I could not recommend Dr. Yang and his practice more highly.<//text>

Looking for a new dentist is always overwhelming but believe me when I say that Dr. Yang’s office is the best I’ve ever been to. The office is very relaxing with views from every room of the trees and creek below. Sierra, the dental assistant, is so helpful in making sure you are comfortable and at ease. The hygienists have always been so gentle and thorough with each cleaning. Dr. Yang has attention to detail that is always excellent and precise. He is very current on the latest technology to be able to provide his patients with the very best care. Definitely check them out if you are in need of a new dentist.<//Review>

The Best in Marin!

First of all, I really appreciate their CV-19 protocols. This was my first visit since the pandemic hit, I felt comfortable everything was being done to keep me safe.

Time for my bi-annual teeth cleaning with Taren. Dr Yang first did an oral exam; he's the consummate professional at work. Dr Yangs office has a large bank of windows that overlook Old Mill Creek with it's trees, birds and squirrels; quite soothing for a dental visit.

Taren does a fabulous job cleaning your teeth. Calming voice explains whats being done (she knows if you haven't been brushing, flossing or using your waterpik). Taren will always give you reminders on how to improve your dental care.

Thanks to the staff for always making "going to the dentist" a pleasurable experience.< /Review>

My front tooth completely broke off and I needed emergency dental repair. I searched on google and I found Dr. Leo Yang's dental service which specialized in same day work. I did my research on his practice and also read up on his office reviews and was convinced to make an appointment for consultation. Once he analyzed my situation, he offered several fix options. I opted for a temp fix. He offered to squeeze me in between appointments and went to work. He worked fast but it was good work. I was impressed with the technology and his expertise in creating my replacement tooth. In the end I was very happy and I can smile again. Thank you to Dr. Yang and his staff!</Review>

A revolution in dentistry. Very clear and concise analysis of my dental
needs. With the advanced image
technology, I was able to follow
the steps in crown replacement
that Dr Yang performed on me.
Every step in the process was
pain free...well explained...and
enjoyable! I cannot recall such
a delightful and professional
experience in my dental history.
Five stars!< /text>

I’m so happy with the one she picked. They are not only accommodating to my needs, but feel they feel like family. They are honest with every visit I’ve been to and recommend and educate what I need to maintain healthy oral hygiene. They are kind hearted and the type of place where you don’t dread going to. If you are the type of person who has held off on going to the dentist or get a little anxious just thinking about it, give this place a try.

I have put off repairing a tooth, because of the fear and pain usually associated with dental work.  When I met Dr. Yang, I knew he was the right dentist for the job.

Dr. Yang's Staff were helpful, and very thorough, regarding my benefits.  Dr. Yang has a wonderful bed side manner, explaining everything fully.  He was honest and answered all my questions patiently.

My filling needed to be taken out,  and fitted with a crown. I  was impressed with how fast and comfortable  the procedure was. Dr. Yang used a device which provides a "painless" injection.  He was also very meticulous when it came to designing my new crown.

With all the technology and expertise he possesses, I was able to walk out the same day (less than 2 hours, really) with a new and improved tooth!
My new crown looks amazing!

Truth be told, it was unexpectedly pleasant.<//Text>< Resp>

I was travelling California for 3 months and within the last two weeks my wisdom tooth decided to come out to play with an almighty infection. Luckily I came across Mr Yang's dental practice on Google, and they kindly squeezed me in the same day for an emergency appointment.  As a UK resident, our dental care is fantastic, but Mr Yang’s practice is a million times better.  With state of the art technology and exceptionally friendly and informative staff, they made a dreaded visit to the dentist a pleasure.

Each member of staff made an effort to come round, introduce themselves and converse with me to make the service a lot more personal and relaxing.  Mr Yang explained clearly each alternative for my treatment, the pros and cons of each, and what option he thought was best suited.  He performed a painless surgery and I left feeling instantly better.  I will always remember everyone at the surgery for saving my last 2 weeks of travelling and getting me to Burning Man pain free!!

I would recommend their service to anyone,

Thank you to everyone there! X</Text>

Dr. Yang's office is nothing short of spectacular. Him and his staff are extremely welcoming and helpful as they are always eager to help and make sure I am comfortable throughout my entire visit. I came into Dr. Yang's office wanting to whiten my teeth and replace a front tooth veneer that I was self-conscious about for years. He made me a full treatment plan on my first visit and explained step by step the process. I felt extremely confident as Dr. Yang was thorough. He made my veneer in just one office visit using his Cerec machine and made multiple to ensure it was a perfect match - he wanted to make sure we were both happy before I left his office. His attention to detail is truly admirable and I will continue visiting Dr. Yang's office for general routine visits because I know I can trust him and his staff. I would highly recommend Dr. Yang to a friend.< /review>

In for a routine dental hygiene check. Have to say:  one of the best visits ever to a dentist's office!   Taren is a pro, careful, meticulous and engaging.   A nice hello from Dr Yang.  Linda, a new receptionist, appears to be a great addition to Dr Yang's office.  What more can i say?

The state of the art equipment there is amazing! Dr.Yang used a 3D cone beam scan to better assess the repairs needed in my mouth. It was extremely helpful for me to see exactly what was happening with my teeth. I thought I would have to wait a few weeks to get my new crowns but I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that they use a CAD/CAM crown milling machine to make the crowns while I waited. Dr Yang also removed all of my silver fillings and milled small pieces of porcelain along with white composite to make my teeth stronger and more natural looking.
I'm slowly getting my smile back thanks to Dr Yang.</Text>< pics>

The experience I've had with Dr. Yang and his team has been phenomenal.  From day one I was treated so kindly and professionally. My first appointment was a consultation, everything was discussed at length. With follow up appointments, and some preliminary work on my teeth, I had no doubts  walking in for my procedure, and was absolutely confident. To further enhance my experience and ensure that everything was done perfectly and on the same day, Dr. Yang had his in lab technician, Sean, there who used expert technology to perfect the shape, color and fit of my veneers.
My smile was costomized just right, where some of my adjacent teeth were also filed and fixed so that everything blended and my smile was beautiful again.
If I had known that this would be the end result, I would have done this procedure sooner, and I would do it again if I had to. I am so grateful for all the hard work Dr. Yang and his team have done to give me the smile that gives me a reason to smile.<//Text>

I have always been afraid to go to the Dentist for various reasons but now I look forward to my visits with Dr. Yang. His entire staff is incredibly friendly and they make you feel like they have known you for years. Dr. Yang goes above and beyond to ensure that your teeth are and remain healthy. He is always looking out for future dental health which I appreciate. Hands down the best Dental office I have ever been to. I will continue to refer my friends to this amazing place.< /Text>

I've been going to this office for around 30 years. First with Dr. Wong, then with the brilliant Dr Yang. He knows more about teeth than any other dentist I've ever seen. He's kept my teeth in great condition for years. Everyone in this office is super-competent, caring and friendly. I used to hate going to dentists, even for cleaning. Now - is this weird or what? - I actually look forward to my visits. Taren, who cleans my teeth has a wonderfully gentle touch and understands everything about dental hygiene! Even though we no longer live in Mill Valley, I would not think of going elsewhere for my dental care. Dr. Yang's crowns are works of art! A few months ago he had to remove two old crowns (not his work) because there was some decay underneath. Since he fabricates his own crowns, he was able to do both teeth in one visit. It was NOT an ordeal.<//Text>

It's hard to get care any better than this. Dr. Yang's precision and creativity in approaching my dental issues are quite remarkable. He has a way of making difficult problems easier and a manner that is friendly and informative. His staff mirrors his own excellence. If you want to go to the best see Dr. Yang.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Yang is an excellent dentist! My family has been seeing him for many years now. Dr. Yang has always been thorough and efficient, but I was really amazed at how quick and easy it was to get Invisaligns for my daughter. The technology that he uses is really advanced. He used a special camera to take photos of her mouth for our first appointment. Then for the second appointment he checked the fit, and it was perfect! The whole experience was so easy and fast. Dr. Yang really understands the needs of his patients and uses the best technology available to provide the best treatment for those needs. I recommend him to all my friends and family.</Review>< rate>

Dr. Yang has been my dentist for many years. I am very happy with the care and attention he has given to keeping my teeth in good shape. I really appreciated his ability to replace my crown in one visit. No need to wear a temporary and return later. His office staff is efficient and friendly. A very good experience!<//text>

Dr. Leo Yang is one of the most knowledgeable doctors I know. He is not only very up to date on the newest technology but also very good at applying it with the highest quality of work. Dr. Leo Yang is not one of those that attempts to be high tech, he teaches the newest technology. He appears very professional, explains things clearly and is very efficient at everything he does. I am also a dentist and I choose him for my treatments. Great work Leo.< /review>

<Text>I cannot recommend Dr. Yang's practice enough. I needed a fair amount of work done on several teeth that took nearly a year to complete. Each time I sat in his chair, Dr. Yang was incredibly thorough in explaining my options, the advantages and disadvantages of my options, and always took extra measures to make sure I understood everything and could ask questions at anytime. I never once felt rushed or not supported. In addition, I was always impressed that Dr. Yang is constantly educating himself and others in his field to make sure he is competent in the latest technologies and procedures.  His staff is equally kind and professional. One can tell that the entire office works together to make sure the patient receives the best care and services possible.<//Text><gmap_id>0x8085900b7e93f463:0xcff2d6630367e49c</gmap_id>< rating>

I have been a patient at Dr. yang and Dr. Lee for over 15 years. The office is lovely and has a calming effect to those of us who stress about dental work. The staff is super attentive and it is a pleasure to go every time.

At this time I am having implant work done. Dr. Yang has given me a thorough explanation of my options and has explained what the process is like and what to expect. He is very patient and thorough with his work.

It is clear to me that Dr. Yang has expanded his skills and equipment over the years. He used a CONE BEAM 3D SCAN to determine how to place the implant and made my implant crown with his IN-HOUSE MILLING MACHINE.

Going to the dentist is still no fun for me, but this practice makes it as pleasant as humanly possible. :)</review>

I recently starting going to Dr. Yang because my last dentist was practicing with 1980 technology. When I went in for my first appointment yesterday I was really impressed with Dr. Yang, his office and Staff. He had 2 CEREC machines to make same day crowns, digital x-rays, and a 3D imaging machine.

Dr. Yang spent over an hour doing a very thorough examination of my mouth. He showed me areas of my mouth that had some issues. He did this to educate me and never felt like he was trying to sell or pressure me on doing work.

I would highly recommend Dr. Yang to anyone who wants a truly caring & thorough dentist using the latest technology available to preform the best dental care possible.</review>

I absolutely love Mill Valley Smiles. I have had many dentists in my life and have always dreaded going to appointments but from the moment I walked into Mill Valley Smiles I felt comfortable and at ease. The receptionists are friendly and attentive and I have never had to wait more than a few minutes to be seen. Dr. Yang is warm and friendly and the work I have had done with him has been fantastic. He made a crown for me at the office while I waited so I didn't have to come back weeks later as I have had to do in the past with other dentists!!! I really feel like this is the best quality care available. I drive an hour to come see Mill Valley Smiles and couldn't imagine going anywhere else anymore. I can't recommend this place highly enough!</Text>

<date>1563387039715<//date><rating>5<//rating><Text>Hello everybody who wants good teeth. Doctor Yang & Lee's practice is the ultimate in modern dentistry. With up to date technology combined with skillful professional ability Doctor Yang and the staff are responsible for the excellent condition of my teeth. I recently called the office with a throbbing pain in a left rear molar. The office got me in that day on my way to a performance. Doctor Yang appraised the situation and determined to do a deep cleaning of the tooth. The procedure completely resolved the issue. The tooth itself has a unique history and is not decayed but has a weak bone structure supporting it in one place causing the discomfort. We will monitor the tooth as we go. Doctor Yang did the work on short notice, that day, and got me on my way in comfort. After twenty or more years with Doctor Yang I'm confident that he and the staff will be able to facilitate my dental needs for a long time. I would not consider another dentist. Why should I? I get in, get good to go, and get going, better than before. Thank you Doctor Yang, Doctor Lee, Taren, Gloria, and Amily.< /Text>< Pics>

I had been considering veneers for quite some time to correct some imperfections in my smile, but was nervous to pull the trigger on such a permanent procedure.  I am so glad that I did, and couldn't be more thrilled that I chose Dr. Yang and his team to give me my new smile.

I met with Dr. Yang a couple of times before deciding to move forward.  He was extremely thorough and patient, happy to spend time with me and answer all of my questions.  I never felt rushed or pressured at all.  He was happy to show me photos of past clients he had worked with who approved their stories to be shared, and I was more than impressed with the results.  His style is very natural.

Perhaps the most exciting thing about the office is Dr. Yang's advanced technology.  This innovation allows you to get same-day veneers, meaning you don't have to spend weeks wearing temporaries while the veneers are made. This is a tremendous advantage, as I have heard some horror stories about the durability of temporary veneers.

The actual procedure was very comfortable.  The entire staff went out of their way to make me feel at ease, offering me a blanket, water, and checking in on me throughout the day.  I brought headphones and spent most of my visit listening to an audiobook.  It was a long procedure - several hours - but by the end of it, I had a brand new smile.  I was off to Tahoe with friends the next day with very minimal side effects.

The final results have more than exceeded my expectations.  Many people have noticed a positive change, but can't quite pinpoint it, which was exactly what I hoped.  More importantly, I feel more confident when I look in the mirror, and am quicker with a smile than ever before.

I highly recommend Dr. Yang and his wonderful staff, and look forward to years ahead as his client.

Thank you Dr. Yang and team!< /review>< resp>

Going to the office is like going to see old friends.
Today I went over there just for the cleaning and as usual Tamer was great.
Nice people and make it always a great experience and a lot of fun.
Stop pulling your teeth and go to see them.

<Time>1429825042091< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><review>Dr. Yang has been my dentist for some years now.  I have what I call a "complicated mouth"--i.e., some years ago, I had mandible surgery (for a bad bite), and, since then, I've had all kinds of dental procedures (too many to list here).  Though I inherited a bad set of teeth, I've managed with a great deal of care and good dental care to retain my teeth--and they actually look good!.

I've been to several dentists through the years, and can easily separate out the merely very good dentists from the excellent.  Dr. Yang is excellent--as good as they get!  He is thoroughly professional:  he will not recommend unnecessary dental procedures and doesn't overcharge. Plus, he's "up" on the latest, and he finds the most direct way to solve one's dental problems.  His office staff are just great. I wouldn't go elsewhere, and I do commute from Oakland to Marin to see Dr. Yang.  It's worth the drive to excellent dental care.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I recently visited Dr. Yang with a problem tooth thatI knew would have to be extracted. Had all the concerns
that go with that problem, what to do about the gap (it was a front tooth) and of course all the accompanying
“mild” discomfort.Fortunately I have been going to Dr. Yang ever since he expanded an existing practice in Mill Valley many
years ago and by this time, even though originally a dental coward I have gained significant comfort and
confidence in his deft hands. His approach is that the better informed the patient the more comfortable they are with the process,
He first helped by outlining in some detail the various scenarios,solutions and results from doing nothing to the gap, to an
appliance (flipper) or the ultimate but scary dental implant.  After significant thought I picked the implant and it proved to be as
easy and effective as Dr. Yang described. No regrets!< /Text>

I really like Leo's enthusiasm for his business_his love of dentistry, and taking care of his patients, both in the office, and in following up after work has been done. Drs Yang and Lee are really up on technology, everything from the latest software to fit and manufacture crowns in the office, to keeping track of appointments, kids appointments etc _also comforting to know that if there is a new and better way to do things, Leo will be all over it! The staff is really helpful, very nice, and willing to work with you to ensure that you get exactly what you need_an all around great experience.< /review>

Some years earlier, I had had my upper teeth veneered necessitating multiple office visits, and having temporary veneers applied (several of which fell off in the weeks I was waiting for my next appointment). It is quite startling how, in only a few years, dentistry has changed. If it's new technology, this office has it. Working hand-in-glove with his in-house laboratory technician, Dr. Yang prepares the teeth, fabricates the veneers, and applies them all in one visit. Your entire smile happens in only one day. It's really like you are an art project, and your new smile is the finished result.<//Text></record>

Look no one wants to be at the dentist.  I'll be honest, I have the worst teeth from way back.  Only wish I had taken better care years ago.   I have always put off the work from the treatment plans provided by Dr. Yang only to find that the work got more expensive to fix the longer I waited.  I should have done the work at the first sign of trouble.  Something that could have been a simple crown worked its way into a root canal on one occasion.
I've been going to Dr. Yang for over 15 years.  Never once has he pushed extra unneeded work on me.  I particularly like that he is current on the newest equipment and techniques available.  He uses digital x-rays(instant pictures) and has a machine that makes the crowns right in the office as you wait.  He is fast and gentle.  I still have dental work from when I first came in that is in great shape.
I would highly recommend this office.  My teenage daughter also goes here but she has great teeth, I made sure of that.</text>

< Review>
Dentistry is not an easy profession, I always have great respect for all my dentists and hygienists over the years.  Before relocating to Mill Valley, I continued to go to the same dentist after he recommended a thousand-dollar device that ended up doing nothing for a problem I had.  For I know he had good intentions and cares about his patients.  But I just had such a bad experience at Dr. Yang’s office being accused of not wanting to pay for a procedure that I clearly didn’t receive.  The back and forth conversation was so frustrating and insulting that it prompted me to write this review and hope to warn other people.

I am fairly new to the area, and just had my third visit at Dr. Yang’s in early February.  When I received the bill, I noticed there’s a $65 charge for the fluoride that I didn’t get. so I called the office to tell them to correct it.  The receptionist told me she would discuss with Dr. Yang and my hygienist, Taren.  After waiting for a week and not hearing any follow up, I called again.  This time the receptionist told me “the hygienist says the fluoride was applied, but as a one time courtesy, they will take the charge off.”

I couldn’t believe what I just heard.  I explained to her that it’s not possible to NOT notice there’s fluoride on my gum. That’s precisely why I declined it this time after cleaning. I don’t normally like the fluoride when I used to get it,  and it will be too uncomfortable with my Invisagn.  That’s exactly what I said to Taren, the hygienist at the time, if she needs to be reminded how it happened.  The receptionist put the manager on the phone to talk to me.  So I explained the situation again, and told her that, during the visit, I also told the doctor I will come for an extra cleaning every year even though insurance won’t cover it, to help with my invisalign treatment.  And I will need to replace a few crowns after the treatment completes.  So I am committing to thousands of dollars of future procedures, why would I lie to cheat $65 out of you.  The manger apologized for how upsetting this’s making me, but she would have to talk to Taren again, and said: “maybe she didn’t do it”, then went on to insinuate that maybe I took the fluoride with me instead.  I was just flabbergasted by now.  How tone deaf are you to say that it’s just a “maybe” which means I could still be lying about it,  or that I could have pocketed it but trying not to pay for it.  And how stupid is this business to accuse a customer with thousands of dollars of work in the near term to try to rob you $65?!

Honestly, the dollar amount is not even that big a deal, but this whole experience with them besides being upsetting and infuriating, it made me question their business practices and how they really treat their patients and customers.

A word of caution, make sure to check your bills every time, especially if you bring your kids there, know exactly what has been done since they might not know themselves.

Re: owner response on 3/18/2019

My other doctors would offer "cash price" quote on services when insurance doesn't cover it without me asking. But I guess those are doctors who care about their patients.

Your response revealed your continue failure to grasp the nature of the situation.  I am not happy because you wrongfully charged me a service that I didn't receive. And canceling it after me calling multiple times as a "one time courtesy" is scant solace.  Still don't see the problem? Let me spell it out for you.  First, you took your hygienist's words without listening to reasoning.  Second, even if I could put my feelings aside, how can I be sure this won't happen again?  And what do I do then?  Ask for a second courtesy?  A normal business would have just said:" Sorry we make a mistake, it won't happen again, see you again soon."  End of story.

If my first review was to tell you not to wrongfully accuse your customer of cheating, here's lesson number two, don't act defiant when you are in the wrong, it's very petty, especially for a business.< /Review>

<text>Dr. Yang was referred to me by a close friend.  As he came highly recommended,  I decided to see him even though I live 2 hours away.  An area of teeth had been chronically bothering me for few months.  He was kind enough to see me over a weekend, as it is hard for me to get to Marin during the week.   He gave me a very detailed explanation of the issue. Also recommended treatment options to help rule out all possibilities that might be causing the pain.

It was a gum issue and his hygienist Taren did an extremely thorough deep cleaning that was absolutely painless.  She gave me home care tips, how to angle the Waterpik and flush the area to keep it clean.  The issue resolved and I have had no pain ever for one year.  Thus, Dr. Yang and Taren became dental providers for life.

Highly recommend them!!< /text>< Date>

NONE BETTER! Best in class, offers latest technology and expert artistry.  Flawless every time I have been here.  CEREC crown work is so much better than other dentists I had seen.  And special thanks for "saving me" over the weekend after an ancient  veneer cracked and fell out of my front tooth...Dr. Yang responded immediately to my request for an urgent appointment; he took 2+ hrs over his weekend to provide a fix the tooth with world class results. NONE BETTER! TOP MARKS!< /review>

This review is for the work that I receive from Dr. Yang's dental hygienist, Samira Snaif. The whole office is highly trained, professional and friendly. Dr. Yang does the big work that I sometimes require and he is tops. However, my most frequent contact is with my hygienist, Samira, Not only is she so nice to work with, but she explains what is happening and, after many years of ignoring the advise of the hygienist, has gently convinced me that good technique will pay off. I brush & floss as an old guy more than i have in years. The results prove that her gentle urging works. BTW, she rocks.!</Text>

Very friendly staff, calm and comfortable atmosphere,  Dr. Yang always handles my dental needs with care. I used to stress out before going to my old dentist, but I no longer feel anxious or stressed out when I'm going to see Dr. Yang. Keep up the good work!<//text>

<Review>If you want the best, go to Dr. Yang. I’ve been to several dentists in Marin county, and Dr.Yang is far superior to all of them. Dr. Yang, Sierra, Gloria and the whole staff were so accommodating and sincere when I had an implant on my front tooth. At first I was a bit nervous about the whole procedure, since it sounded like a grueling process. But yesterday I finished the implant with the crown, and I’m beyond happy with the result as I write this! It was smooth sailing from begining to end. I was blown away how fast and efficient they were on every single step. An implant is no walk in the park to my knowledge, but they absolutely nailed it with zero error or hiccups along the way. Do they secretly practice every possible dental procedure at home every night?! Incredible!

Oh and the their tools are at the cutting edge of technology. I can tell they’re passionate and meticulous when it comes to devices and creating crowns, veneers, etc. I won’t be surprised if my crown has internet too! Lastly, Gloria the receptionist is too nice and is always working with your schedule and insurance. Sierra is the same and will even go out of her way to comtact you should anything important come up. All in all, I dont know why you would go anywhere else, Dr. Yang and Co. is simply the best!< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1530028933110, 'text': 'We strive for personalized care, team work and try to be the best.

Great staff, superb Doctors of dentistry and more.  Top professionals - Loyal customer - patient since they opened practice in MV.  Drs. Lee and Yang are truly a cut above. Very personalized, very cutting edge in latest treatment options.   They make anyone that is a patient feel very important.  They explain all aspects of treatment, options, pros and cons, and take the time..........Rare.<//review>

I'm so grateful for Dr leo Yang and everyone in the office..I know when I go there that I will be taking cared, listened and they have the best technology...I'm the kind of person who is scared of the dentist and I have been there for 13 years and they are so sensitive of my needs...I'm so grateful and recommend everyone to go to them..I'm so grateful I found my special dentist....Warmly and love...Sabine< /Review>

<text>It was my second time coming to this bakery  and first time since the pandemic. It was a terrible experience the cashier was rushing me to what I wanted plus when I was giving her the money to pay, she did not have her mask completely covering her nose.  Cashier even when I was giving her the money was very impatient and I was the only customer in the bakery and to make it worst once she gave me my change she did not handed me my bags I have to get it through the glass and walk away without saying have a great day . I will definitely not ever set my feet in this place terrible customer service.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Love this place.  Great baked goods and the tamales are tasty.  The cakes and sweets are to die for.   I can't just go there and have a few items, I have to get alot for me and my family.  Perfect place to get your birthday cake.< /review>

<text>I went this Friday to order a 3 leches cake. It took the lady 30 minutes to take my order because she kept giving me wrong information. Until the owner corrected her and he didn't apologize for my time wasted. When I picked up the cake on Sunday to my surprise it was not 3 leches. These people stole my time my money and my family was so upset because they were expecting 3 leches. I specifically ordered 2 days in advanced.  This Baker let me down. Please learn from my experience.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><username>Maria Jaimes< /username><user>105070049776814228572< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Came in on a Saturday morning to check it out. So glad I did because the sweet bread was amazing. Flavorful and soft I will be coming back for sure based off of that. We got half dozen pork tamales and 1 bean cheese and jalepeno tamale. I personally liked the pork tamales but my husband said for him needs for sauce and he wasn't a fan of the paper wrap instead of corn husk. He did however really love the bean cheese jalapeno he will be going back for that. The staff was nice and super helpful. Great atmosphere and clean.</Text></record>

Great service and food. Delivery was on time and very professional. I ordered to delivery at a local hotel. The creamy pesto chicken and a greek salad were absolutely good. It came with all condiments, plenty of them. I’m recommend this place.< /Review>

<review>This Restaurant Is The Worst' the pizza pie is Tasteless with no flavor ' there's no Taste in the Tomato Sauce' the bread is Tasteless' blend. The chesse looks disgusting.  The wings no Taste no flavor. For 30 buck's i could have done better .. Even little ceasers across the corner would had been a better lunch.. So if you want tasteless no flavor pizza this is your spot.. Oh for a pizza parlor and they don't have parmesan" they handme  little packages of  parmesan...<//review><date>1581305294298<//date>< UserId.>

To start off I will say they make some top notch hot wings... They were cooked perfectly and had the right amount of sauce on them... I followed up with a 3 topping pizza... The crest with a perfect thickness and the toppings were plentiful so they will definitely get my business again 🥰</text>

<review>Wow!!! It was very very good! Def exceeded my expectations!! I searched for chicken sttips on google and they popped up. Well after looking at the menu i decided to go with the chicken dinner which came with fries, a salad,garlic bread and ribs. O my!!! Big Thank you to the chef. The meat was not dry, it had lots of flavor and it fell off the bone when i took a bit. The portion was good for the price also........I will def be visiting them again.....<//review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I was craving pizza and I was tried of the regular franchise variety (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Domino, etc..) and decided to give Bravo a chance... I'm glad I did. The pizza was very good, had a regular pepperoni w/ mushroom. I also ordered some buffalo-wings... loved them. Nice and spicy. I ordered for delivery, the girl that took my order was nice a friendly... got my order right the first time. The delivery kid was a young and clueless... but so darn nice I just didn't mind his inexperience. I got my new pizza joint... I will sure be ordering here again.</review>< Pics>

I ordered dinner to be delivered to my brother in Burbank--I live in Massachusetts. He said the food was delicious, but that the fries were just awesome--real potatoes and well-seasoned. He said they reminded him of McDonald's fries from 20 years ago. Thank you so much Bravo Pizza and Chicken! I have no idea what the decor since this was a delivery order.<//Review>

First time there based on other reviews. I found the food to be decent, but unspectacular. Chicken was cooked nicely, but unexciting, and fries were pretty average. They forgot my garlic bread too which I noticed too late. Nothing worth going out of my way to experience.<//Text>

< Review>
Should be ZERO stars. This place went from being a mediocre alternative to Ceasars 2 doors down to being ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Food has devolved to being now INEDIBLE.  Been going there since they opened. Tried to support local small business. Over Tipped drivers to make up for weak start. etc. Result? Now, all you get is zero customer service over 1/2 or longer for walk in, dismissive treatment, to be served food UNDERCOOKED & RAW, Pizza not sliced overgreased. When you call back you a "I So Solly" SERIOUSLY, and a hang up. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.< /Review>

Pizza was okay. It's the kind of pizza that has the bread made before hand and the toppings baked on after. So it's a bit disconnected when you eat it. The chicken was good.<//Review>

<Text>Broasted goodness. 40 years ago broasted chicken was commonbin L.A. not as much as Pioneer Chicken but you could easily find it. Now it's a rarity.

This place does a decent job. I should know, I manned a broaster at Amber's Chicken 40 years ago...Now I'm dating myself.

The salads are big and very fresh. Owner is friendly and seems very glad to see you. Much better than KFC. Ranch dressing is outstanding. It's the little things that matter. Aren't they?<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<name>JONATHAN A< /name><time>1609140866674<//time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>30 years ago this was the best dumpling & noodle place in southern California; there are now 100 other great dumpling & noodle houses in SoCal, but this one is just as great as ever and still competitive with newer top San Gabriel Valley places. Our favorites are the cold tofu salad (best anywhere), spicy pork chili soup noodle, of course the dumplings & scallion pancakes, excellent hot & sour, country style tofu, pungent shrimp. Handmade noodles are a great option, but the regular noodles are also surprisingly good. Beef noodle soup is legendary. Even Fried Rice is excellent.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMVKc5lTu6t2KoupgF3W_XZ1alh-kwJ4SRCa0u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfln8UsG1OjPdWqP6aj358WutKiQkhb5NCqcwC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3uAqjdif3J2_z_aaWeqg9JpBoRzc9MswfL5sl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHjEIvrKVbAMbLSAiW6XcDQIBoBME3s-TqOph6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObkOOQQxFAmdZphwfM_3XAxUBT-ZjND4g0d8Z-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4HRPvVitAxQLXbqDRFHo8zX9F0vyjYgT-Dh9C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU39T1HoNaxj6a_ltWYM-9HZZsp_k-O0i05gmC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMue9qx3HFKx8YACTQm3PutTHdCTvUWxzDv4P67=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN67xiIxBJUTMY2GgsdRFK5fZpIWassESlAHyY5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

We've been going here for 10+ years. This is the place to get beef noodle soup, dumplings, stir fried rice cakes, and so much more. Our kids have grown up asking for food from here. Went in today to pick up togo and found out THEY ARE CLOSING AT THE END OF THE YEAR . A new noodle place will be there and they say it's also good but still! We are going to miss this place! They are going to be here until the end of the year so, I'll be back at least twice by then.< /Text>

Food is really good!  Quality and friendly service.  I always get the beef noodle soup.  They use prime cuts of beef and cook it until super tender.  I highly recommend this place.</Text>

You won't find food this tasty anywhere in the valley. If you eat their beef noodle soup, you will be hooked. Very nice staff, family owned. I'll never leave this place without giving a decent tip. Been trying many different Chinese restaurants and none come close to the authenticity. If the prices were doubled, I'd still eat here.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>It was my first time today at this locally family-owned restaurant. The food was excellent. Plenty of seating. I love the parking. I could eat here at least once a week or several times a week. Food prices are very reasonable. And it was nice seeing lots of families eating together with their parents and the children. Also saw some younger people maybe they were dating. It's just a good wholesome restaurant to have some good Chinese food<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1usTC6UnpT1bIzStrpypxMRxaf1EcKcfNsQYf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvsv8P7yW6x_Q_VE5kSnog0iLpbdB79Vfek2HY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRw7ukJ1jzbb3z8rshjwVAJgiWLFdYBYvbic-L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c29baa633991a3:0x743a5c126a5a14bc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I’m giving a 4 star because the food is really good, but the speed in which it comes out is not so great. It took 50 minutes for our first hot dish to come out (after asking if they forgot about our dishes) and that was slightly warm at best, but not hot. It’s unfortunate because I see so much potential if they did some basic updating to the place and revisited their service.<//Review>< pics>

This restaurant is the best in the area for simple, tasty Chinese food. Some dishes I always order are the scallion pancakes, cold cuts, pickled cucumber, and combination fried rice. I also usually order one of their noodle dishes (beef noodle soup, bean and pork, or sesame with chicken), all of which are pretty good and come in huge portions.

This spot has been around for years so it looks a bit run down. But it never gets too crowded so the food comes out pretty quick.< /review>

Great dumplings! Really like no other in the valley. You have to try the beef soup noodles, it's fantastic. Great food made fresh from scratch so it sometimes takes a little while but service is excellent. You can't go wrong here</review>

The beef noodle soup with handmade noodles is beefy and delicious. The handmade noodles are a little thicker but soft. Definitely get a green onion pancake. They have the thickest ones around and are tasty.<//Review>

<Text>This restaurant serves delicious, memorable Chinese cuisine, and I never would have guessed it judging by the outside. The Beef noodle soup is incredibly tasty.

When I was there, they immediately served us hot tea. If you want water, you have to request it which I found odd. The workers-- who might be just be the couple that owns the spot -- were charming and very friendly. They didn't keep going up to us, though, to ask us if we needed anything like napkins or more water. But I think for what it is, I would definitely go back. Overall, it was a great experience<//Text>< Pictures>

It is suppose to be a casual finger food served by street vendors in their place of origin (and sold for much less).  At least increase the quantity served because, honestly, the quality simply does not justify it. Having to order just so there is enough for our party meant it was more expensive than our most expensuve dish!  After eating this over priced finger food appetizer, everything else just wasn't as tasty.  The stuffing in the dumplings taste slightly sour and skin easily broken.  All signs of not the freshes inventory.  I remember the food quality bring much better years ago.  Unfortunately, all good things come to an end.  There are many superior alternatives now that stand out after this most recent visit.  Too bad.</Review>< Time>

Randomly stopped here because the sign said "best potstickers in LA" and I thought that was a bold claim to make so I had to try it. Not only were the pot stickers absolute fire, the service was incredible and so was the tea. You win the title, Madarin Deli. Bravo.</Review>

I love this place.  In Northridge close to CSUN and surrounded to other restaurants. There's a small kitchen and a handful of wait staff.  It looks to be family owned and run.  Staff is friendly and helpful.

The menu is small.  I've eaten more than half of it and haven't been disappointed.  The beef noodle soup is a standout.  I get an order almost every time I stop in regardless of what else I order.

Highly recommend.

Two items define this place for me: the beef soup with handmade noodles and the scallion pancakes. I've tried their other soups and they're OK-to-good, and their normal dishes look good when somebody else orders them, but the beef soup is pretty consistently awesome and makes it hard to give it up to try something else.</review>

Best pan fried meat dumplings and scallion pancake I've ever had.
You have to dump spoonfuls of their homemade chili oil on both items to further perfect these beautiful dishes 😊<//Review>

The food was very good. When we were there, it seemed there was only one waitress, with the cashier occasionally jumping in to help her. So the service was a bit slow (took us 4 times of asking for water to actually get it—-and it finally came about 20 minutes into our meal). BUT the food was very good and so I’d still highly recommend this place. The Kung Pao chicken and scallion pancakes are two of my favorite foods here.</text>

Friendly service, authentic scallion pancake is a must have! My daughter loves their boiled dumpling made with homemade dough and super juicy stuffing that's cooked to perfection, best to consume when the steam is still rising from your plate!! Chicken fried rice is yummy without being greasy.  Beef noodle soup is too salty but you can always ask the kitchen to put less salt ;)  Side dishes like bean curd and seaweed are delicious!  There's a reason why this restaurant is a staple in Northridge's Chinese food scene.</Review>

<text>Love the food, hate the price.....ok so your wondering why I gave 5 stars.....the answer is simple the food is very authentic I really liked the homemade noodles and the giant pot stickers. Overall I thought I paid what was expected because this is not a cuisine that I can mimick or make on my own. I thought it was very good and the server was nice and attentive. I would definitely go again.<//text><Response>None< /Response><userid>104069399122276041345<//userid>< Date>

Love this place. A Japanese friend of mine brought me there once and i fell  in love with it. The foods good and way more filling than places like Panda express. Most of their portions are pretty big so i usually have left overs.  They're very attentive and prices arn't bad either.  two people can eat for about $30 depending on how much/little you get and what you get. I've also never seen them get so crowded like some big chains get. so there is usually no wait to be seated.< /Text>

<text>Great service, great food.

The staff are friendly and prompt, with a pot of hot tea delivered almost as soon as you sit down, refilled before you can empty it. The staff seem genuinely happy and friendly. When you eat the food, you understand why- who wouldn't be happy to serve such wonderful food?

The food is absolutely delicious. The portions are generous and reasonably priced. The sign outside says "best dumplings and noodles in LA" and it just might be right. The dumplings are fresh, and I suspect they're hand-made in the restaurant- they've got that irregular look you don't find in the store-bought variety.

Eating at Mandarin Deli reminds me of when I was a child, 20+ years ago, and my Gung-Gung and Po-Po would take us out to eat at these wonderful Chinese restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco. The atmosphere is calming, the food is fare worth getting emotional over, and the service is top-notch.</text>< user_name>

Yes, one of the rare ones in LA country that serves authentic Mandarin China style food. It's nothing too spectacular, since it's sorta like villager style food, but it's a treat worth mentioning because it's really the only one in LA.

The specialty item here is the BEEF NOODLE SOUP. It's beef stew cooked in broth soy sauce soup with noodles (hand made or regular) and cilantros. Not too many Chinese restaurants serve this, so definitely try this one. It's pretty delicious and filling. The other notable dishes here are the scallion pancakes and pan fried dumplings.

I gave the restaurant a 4 instead of 5 because the Mandarin Deli location in Monterrey Park is a little better than this one in terms of taste. Chinese neighborhood, it's pretty understandable, eh? Anyways, even this Northridge location's food beats the hell out of the majority of Americanized, tasteless Chinese restaurants out in LA country right now.

So if you're in Northridge, and happen to see this place, give it a try. You won't be disappointed. And this is coming from a Chinese dude<//Text><name>Steve Cha<//name>< GmapID>

<Review>Ordered $46.00 on take out.  It was too far and too late to take it all back.  It was left over 'lunch' food; the chicken was dry and tough, the fried rice was clumped and the pot stickers were soggy. None of the food was fresh.  We called and explained what we found and they just said goodbye.  Okay, goodbye . . . We'll go to the Chinese diner directly across the street<//Review><name>Malibu West<//name><userid>100771961905164968694< /userid>< Time>

I ordered spicy seafood chile soup... they gave me beef noodle soup... waited another 30 mins for vegatable spicy soup since they said they now only have spicy shrimp soup (not seafood soup) and the gave me a soup full of onions (a little spinach),  ughhhhhhhhh. Annoying.<//Text>

This is an okay restaurant for some mandarin cuisine. I know some other great places with really good prices. But if you don't want to drive an extra 15 minutes, so be it. This place is an okay place for some potstickers and noodles. The main thing here is to eat is potstickers and beef stew noodle soup. Both which makes this place famous for. Other things that are served here are not that popular. This place hardly ever gets busy. Yet, I have been coming here since I was a kid. At the time, this place was the only place selling dumplings and noodles with beef stew in soup. Towards the late 90s, this place has grown, so has the furniture, the bathrooms, the ambience..it has grown very dull. The music that seldomly plays does put a nice touch when it DOES play. But other than that, it's really dead here. Same owner, same waitresses from when I was a child. The prices may have risen, but the food quality is not that great anymore. It's still a treat for those who live around the area and who don't have modes of transportation. You should come here. Like I said.. dumplings are a good treat. Just I have grown away from this place.<//review>

This place makes me sick they do not pay the people minimum wage  Juan the owner make he's people work 10 hours a day for  $60.00 a day. So you people out there if you guys want to support this place keep coming to eat on this location that means that you guys are just like the owner Juan. ...<//Text>

(Translated by Google) J s lin is poor to die. It’s no big deal, just go to Vegas, Yellowstone Park. I haven’t dared to speak for so many years. It was not a silent call when the year was over. I will mention your ex every day. I don’t respect people at all and I lose my temper. Break up. Your mom is more locomotive. Obviously your son loves to do it, and everything blames other girls. I wish you all three years of family unhappiness. Do you know her about the woman, not greedy money, greed. Will there be anything else? Have you understood it for 10 years? No one can really know who. You are stupid. Both Chinese and English are broken. Look at all the shops to pour light. Really retribution. It is the worst condition I have ever handed over. That ex she wants to be really beautiful, just look for you better than you. I wish your parents and daughters to die soon. Die faster. Bankruptcy went bankrupt. That one Taiwanese child. A certain woman with poor genetics in the province. The one you grab is really fierce. Do you count the days of marriage by pregnancy? But after the breakup, he called him later. You are pregnant. Some of the home is strictly inconvenient to talk on the phone. You are going to be disappointed. Anyway, the old lady did not see each other after breaking up.

J s lin 窮的要死。結了也沒什麼了不起，只去的起Vegas,黃石公園。結那麼多年也不敢講。當年結了還不是打無聲電話來。一天到晚提了再提你的ex。一點也不尊重人還發脾氣。鬧分手。你老媽更機車。明明是你兒子自己愛搞，什麼事都怪別人女生。祝你們全家族三輩子不幸福。那女的你又了解她嗎，還不是貪錢結，貪身分。還會有別的嗎。10年了你了解牠嗎？沒有誰可以真正了解誰的。你蠢的很。中英文都破。看吧全部的店倒光光。真是報應。是我交過所有的條件最差的。那位ex她要真的很美，隨便找都比你好。祝你父母女兒早點死。死快一點。破產倒閉。那一位台吧子女。本省基因差的某女。你搶的還真兇。算算日子是靠懷孕嫁進去的吧？不過分手後遲了點打給他。你就懷了啊。家裡有些嚴不方便講電話而已。你是要失望了。反正老娘分手後沒再見過面。< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Your family, James Lin, has no choice but to call someone to make trouble at home. He said that someone else is not talking on the phone, and he is not paying attention to him. Why don't you call his wife's family to serve it. I have been looking for my parents' troubles and have not talked about the marriage breakup soon after I handed in the poor and ugly education in Taipei. It’s not that my son-in-law doesn’t know what to say. I have been hitting the house all the time. I didn’t have my email all the time and I was hit by my relatives. Also help Taipei ugly women to have children to take identity. As a result, she is not waiting for 21 years.

(Original)
你家James Lin不要臉還打電話到人家家裡鬧，說什麼別人打電話不講話，跟本是他不理人。怎麼不叫他老婆娘家伺候牠。一直找我父母麻煩又未論及婚嫁分手不久就交台北窮低下女又醜學歷又低。又不是我家女婿不曉ˇ得在騷什麼。一直打到家裡來不要臉。當年也不是沒有我的email一直打到我親戚家有病。還幫台北丑女人生小孩拿身份。結果她還不是要等21年。<//review>

(Translated by Google) The noodles are great. The beef patties were good. Tried the Songhua Egg Tofu, which was not very tasty.

面条很棒。牛肉饼很好。试过松花蛋豆腐，不是很好吃。< /text>

Love my stylist Chi. She does what I ask and is a master at color.  I also come to the salon twice a month for nails and pedicure with Julie. I have been with her for over 15 years. By now she is a member of my family.  Over all everyone at this salon seems happy and glad to be there.</Review>

<date>1566591845256</date><rating>1<//rating><text>I went there because I decided to donate my hair. Ann was the lady who cut my hair, and before she started I explained her many times that my hair had to be completely dry and clean, I asked if she could wash it before without any conditioner ONLY shampoo.
When she was washing my hair she told me “the conditioner that I’m putting on your hair is a very good one and it’s one of the most expensive in the market” as soon as she told me that, I told her that I said since I got in there that my hair couldn’t be wash with conditioner and I asked if she did it, she said that she didn’t but by that time I wasn’t sure if she was following the only 2 things that I told here it was very important, and it wasn’t just because I wanted that way, it was because to donate it those were the requirements, and on the website of the organization clearly says that if the hair is wet or it was washed with conditioner they would throw it away.
My hair was over my but, very healthy and I asked to cut it until my shoulders, she cut it very short (over my shoulders like 5 fingers), and when she gave me the braid, it looked like she cut it with her teeth because it was not straight at all. Before she started I told her that my hair was wet and she didn’t let me even say anything because she was telling me all the time that she did the same thing before many times.
I tried to dry my hair leaving it under the son and I sent it but I never received any certificate of them so I called and they told me that my hair did not meet the requirements to make a wig. It made me very sad!!<//text>< pics>

<review>If you are looking for a fresh look for the summer or if you are tired of your nasty brassy looking hair... Go see Toan! He did an amazing job on my hair. First I was very sceptical and scared that my color won't turn out the way I wanted BUT I LOVE my new hair and I am beyond happy with it. I have received a tons of compliments today.

I was told my hair would be $145-$150 depending on length and thickness. After the stylist commented on my fine hair he told me the price would me $210. Not ok, and the manager looked at me like I should have known the price. I had half a mind to just walk out and pay the $150 but I coughed up the rest since this is how salons scam people out of money.<//Text>

Honduran food. Yum!! Suggestion of the seafood soup (sopas de mixta $18ish) was really good...like a curry soup. Friends loved the pupusas and baleada! Located by MacArthur park. Staff was really sweet and spoke English.< /review>

It's out in LA next to MacArthur Park in Westlake. This places is run by an amazing family. They are Honduran and bring that authentic, traditional recipe to the foods. I had the baleadas (which are their Honduran style tortillas), which was pretty good. I also ate their sopa mixta, the conch meat soup with coconut milk, which was also very tasty, especially if you love seafood. The Honduran style fried chicken was also great here, loved the sauce that was over it. And I got to try many of their appetizers on their sampler plate which had everything from the pastelitos (fried empanadas) to tacos dorados (kind of like a taquito).

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant. The food was fresh, it had great taste, and the service was wonderful. This restaurant will give you a great first impression of Honduran food if you've never had it before. I shot a YouTube video of Dona Bibi's which you can find on my channel, Rockstar Eater</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had been coming to this restaurant since the day they opened but sadly today will be my last day. I received the worst service by THE OWNER!! I placed my order over the phone and when I got there, the owner started screaming at me because I hadn't ordered my drinks over the phone. He was beyond rude, disrespectful and unprofessional!! The food was tasteless and the flour tortilla was not cooked well. I demanded my money back since I had not started to eat and ge just laughed in my face!</Text>< response>

I came to this place and they wouldn't even serve me. The waitress walked by me a total of 8 times. Never offered me menu or hello or anything. Had I know this place was only for Hispanic people, I wouldn't have embarrassed myself by sitting there for 15min waiting to be served.<//Review>

Server was very friendly!  The pastelitos are my favorite!  The vegetarian burrito is the best one I've ever had!  Their homemade hot sauce is EXCELLENT!  Platanos Maduros con todo is really good.  Jamaica is good.  Papusas are okay.  Hot chocolate was from a mix.< /Text>

Excellent. First time in this restaurant first time actually having proper Honduran food. I ordered a pupusas with beans and cheese it came with amazing delicious spicy coleslaw.  It was so good I ordered myself a second one. And then the Baja Fish Tacos that I had for my entree where flaky light crisp and the soft corn tortilla was cooked to perfection.
I will definitely be back<//review>

Unfortunately we've spend so much time going to this place even when we never liked their bad customer service. I'm one to always read others' reviews, and by the looks I haven't been the only one to experience bad customer service from this place. I recommend everyone to rather go to Rincon Hondureño, which is not so far from this place. Ladies there sure take good care of everyone and are so attentive to giving you the best service you'll need. These people are just so rude and seem to treat you like they wa t you out of there Asap. Wouldn't return to this place again.< /review>

<text>The food here is amazing. We go all the way from Ventura to eat there. Honduran food is boss. We have been to other Honduran restaurants and not one comparable to this one. Plus the owner is very friendly and always with a smile. Their agua de tamarindo,  Maracuya and this other one that is yellow is best. Amazing food once again.</text>< Pictures>

Honduran food that is delicious. Go and order the fried chicken with Platano maduro a side of cream with an order of HAND MADE FLOUR TORTILLAS. You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.  You should also try a Baleada. Hand made flour tortilla with your choice of eggs, avocado, refried beans, cream, cheese or all of the above...repeat after me Scrumchilideeumptious in other words quite yummy. Enjoy. PS they are closed on MondaysI believe<//Review>

It is one of my favourites... I would give it 5 stars but unfortunately the service and over priced menu spoils it every time...

Recently spent $30 on a breakfast for 2.. The food might be worth it but the establishment isnt booshy enough... Sticky tables, short staffed..wait time etc... I kinda expect more for my money.

Love these guys but please stop ripping people off it is Macaurther park theres food like this everywhere for cheap...

Absolute worst service ever. The cashier didn't take our order and didn't even help us out. We waited by the register for 15 minutes until we found an empty table and when we sat down no one came to take our order. Worst 40 minutes wasted waiting and we didn't even had our order taken.</review>

You must try the 'baleadas'! The fresh juices (tamarind, passion fruit, etc) - refreshing!< /Text>

< Review>
I ordered tajadas and they didn't put sauce on it, and it didn't have any flavor! I called to make the complain and the lady who answered the phone was so rude and she didn't even try to help me!   Horrible customer service!!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) What bad attention they have in this restaurant, they believe they are the eighth wonder of the planet ... I went to eat and they had people sitting and they did not want to give me a table, I asked why and they said that only Hondurans live they are very radical

Q mala atencion tienen en este restaurante se creen la octava maravilla del planeta...fui a comer y tenían gente sentada y no quisieron darme una Mesa pregunte porq y dijieron q solo hondureños resivian son bien razistas</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) We are in the time of the pandemic and when you look for it in Google it says that you can eat in the place, today that I went if I could eat in the place but in some ugly tents that were falling down, the tables dirty and next to a trash can with flies ... The uncooked rice and the sunrise beans .... I didn't like the taste of the food

(Original)
Estamos en tiempo de la pandemia y cuándo lo buscas en Google dice que puedes comer en el lugar, hoy que fui sii podia comer en el lugar pero en unas carpas feas que se caían, las mesas sucias y al lado un bote de basura con moscas... El arroz crudo y los frijoles amanecidos.... No me gustó  el sabor de la comida<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Worst place I have ever visited
I ordered some slices with chicken and the slices were like hard toast and the man tells me that I have to tell him that I want them watered down and in my life I had never heard such a thing and he wanted me to pay something that I did not even try in the end I paid 10 dollars for 2 shot and an orchata after the anger that made me go, I left the shot since I never had to have or discussion of any kind if this gentleman was professional if he could give him negative 2 would give them if his palate is demanding or lean here but it goes dislike

(Original)
Peor lugar al que e visitado
Ordene unas tajadas con pollo y las tajadas estaban como tostadas de duras y me dice el señor que le tengo que decir que las quiero aguadas ni en mi vida había escuchado tal cosa y quería que pagara algo que ni probé al final pagué 10 dólares por 2 baleadas y una orchata después del enojo que me hizo pasar le dejé la baleada puesto que nunca tubo que haber ni discusión de ningún índole si fuese profesional este señor si pudiera darle negativo 2 se los daria si su paladar es exigente ni se asome aquí sino va pasar un desagrado<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It was my first time to go to this place, and the service is awful, and the worst food, I ordered two roasts of roast beef, and they gave me two bales of ground beef, they said that those are the roasts of roast beef, and I I know the difference between ground beef and roast beef, it is in the first Honduran restaurant that I get a shot like that! 👎

(Original)
Era mi primera vez de ir a este lugar,  y el servicio es horrible,  y la comida peor,  ordene dos baleadas de carne asada,  y me dieron dos baleadas de carne molida,  ellos dicieron que esas son las baliadas de carne asada,  y yo se la diferencia de carne molida y de carne asada,  es en el primer restaurante hondureño que me dan una baleada asi!! 👎</Review>
