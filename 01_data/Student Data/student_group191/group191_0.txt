I start with you can't do better.  Very good product.  Well  Come on, it's a product.  You can't do better.  One thing I want to shout out - is the customer service.  When I bought my 2 pairs of glasses, The lady fixed a pair of my bent glasses from earlier.  They have a machine that can fix your bent glasses!  That is worth being a customer.</text>

Been going for many years, this time they seem to have the same styles over and over, only the name of the vendors were changed. Service is ALWAYS great, part of why I go back year after year. Timeframe of when my frames arrive is excellent.!  Definitely give them a look.<//Text>

Great service.  Very aware with the COVID-19 procedures at the entrance.  From the eye exam to the eye wear fitting.  Amber was very professional and assist me in getting the right frame.  She was also able to expedite my prescription glasses so that I would able to get it in couple days. Great job Amber and Eyeglass World.< /review>

I recently visited this place for the first time, but it for sure will not be my last time! The staff is super pleasant and caring and I received an outstanding service! Yalda was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and most importantly professional! She is an amazing listener who patiently spent time with me, showing me a variety of eye glasses and helping me to find the best eye glasses I have ever owned! I would definitely recommend this place (and Yalda) to anyone!

Thank you Eyeglass World!<//text>

I was put on hold for 14 minutes to be told my glasses were still not ready. The offer says same day glasses but it’s day 2 and my glasses are still not ready. Their designer frames are way overpriced. The frames used for the  2 for $79 deal are poor quality. I will not be coming back.<//text>

You can't get your prescription information unless you come physically into the store, have it mailed or have it faxed to you. This is incredibly inconvenient for someone who's traveling and needs a couple new contacts. Why should I be unable to access information that I paid for if I'm able to verify all of my information?

Aside from that they offer good service in store.< /Review>

I have to call them constantly to see if my glasses are ready.
They never contact me.
Have been waiting for over a month for a pair glasses didn't notify me my 1st shipment was stolen or missing then had to re order over a month now and still waiting.
Staff is nice but I feel like I'm being taken advantage of financially for I've made 2 payments already and still have no product.< /Review>

I went in to look for frames, and expressed that I thought the place I had gotten my eye exam done may have not gotten my prescription right. They offered to put my prescription into test glasses for me to try and when it wasn't right, they ended up offering me a free eye exam on the spot to work out what was wrong with it. The optometrist who did my exam was awesome, and really took the time to make sure my prescription was dialed in exactly correct, and spent time explaining to me what went wrong with my other prescription and how she was changing it. I can absolutely recommend both the optical shop and the optometrists office, and I will be getting all my exams and frames from here in the future.< /Text>< Response>

<review>BEWARE. The employees at this location will try to upsell you and will give you misleading information about their prices and the lens materials. I went in to help my mother buy glasses and was shocked by the general misinformation and efforts to get her to spend more. Having worked in optical before I was surprised how they made it seem like her only option was one of the most expensive. I wouldn't be shocked if this place takes advantage of their other customers who might not be educated about what they are ordering.

Their prices are also not as low as they advertise. Both pairs we ordered from here were the same price as pairs ordered from Lens Crafters.</review><rate>2< /rate><pics>None<//pics><username>Mike C< /username><gmap_id>0x80dc0058c15f553b:0x828012d9e1868cc0<//gmap_id><date>1603186573522<//date><Response>{'time': 1603302753050, 'text': "I’m very sorry you and your mother had an unpleasant experience with us.

Then it was time for my eye exam. Dr. Monck was literally the best! I am a first timer going to the eye doctor so I was a little (LOT) anxious. The thought of my eyes being messed with is terrifying! She put me at ease and was so knowledgeable, 10/10 WOULD recommend.

First of all they said they work with VSP insurance, before taking appointment, after all I had to pay out of my pocket...

Miscommunication had costed me.. later I asked to send prescription on 09/21/2020. I called them at 2:06 and given fAc number after multiple calls they sent me at 2 :45 made to wait for 40 minutes...

Service is too bad.. I suggest not visit to this center anymore... bad staff attitude<//text>

I had a brief but pleasant experience with this location. I had a pair of frames that I purchased online and wanted to have prescription lenses put in. I called into this location and they invited me to come in so they could look at the frames and see if it was possible.  I did not catch the name of the gentleman that helped me but he was very friendly and helpful and we were able to add my prescription to the frames. The process was seamless and they had my glasses ready in less than 2 hrs. I have no complaints.< /Text>

Update. Wow wow wow. I came back to Return my Glasses because I did not like them. The manager helped me. Some lady named Fuqua or something like that. She was extremely rude and not helpful AT ALL. ONCE AGAIN. I PICKED OUT MY FRAMES AND LENSES ALONE. AND SPENT 300$ more dollars. So 500$ and they still treat you like you do not matter at all!!  I was upset and dropped my card on the desk. The manager accused me of THROWING IT AT HER!!  She taised her voice at me and Scolded me like I was her child. They are extremely wound Tight here!  I don’t know if they are stressed or what.  They have 0 Customer Service skill here. The only reason I spent 600$ here is because I NEED GLASSES TO SEE!!!  Otherwise I would have Walked out. Only here can you come back and decide to exchange and spend more money will they treat you like you don’t matter. .
I come here for my prescriptions because the girls are always really nice and friendly. The doctor was great and the girl in doc tech was great!  No complaints there whatsoever. The issue I had was with my optician John. I could tell he was new and I was patient with him. He took FOREVER to give me a price. When I was trying on glasses he would Not let me use the key to open any myself and he wauus following me around silently.  Completely Silent. He didn’t make any small talk. Didn’t try to see what style I liked. NOTHING. THE WHOLE TIME HE IS ON THE COMPUTER SILENCE. I’m telling you it was truly bizarre it was like he was scared of me or suspicious. I really did not get a good vibe at all and he made me really uncomfortable by the way he was 2 feet away from me but not talking.  I have been to eyeglass world every year for 5 years. I know how their frame deal works and I know the lens options in depth. He got lost and tried to blame it on me. He actually said “ are we done playing Monty shuffle with the frames?”  Like are you serious bro?? You got lost and can’t keep up and u want to try and blame the customer?  Now I got my lenses and I hate them. I wanted Xtraactive but he couldn’t give me a price on just one pair. I bought the glasses because I really needed them. I paid 300$ for 1 pair of plastic lenses with transitions. I hate them without the Non Glare coating. He couldn’t give me a price so I just finally paid to get out of there.The only reason I’m giving 2 Stars is because the Manager Jesse.  He was a really cool Knowledgeable person. He should have came and helped John.  He probably didn’t hear me but I know more than John at this point. If you see someone like me. Don’t put them with the newbie alone. I knew the answers before I asked I just wanted to make sure it was still the same. Every time I asked a question John had to leave the desk to talk to Jesse. This made it take even longer!!  My appointment was 10:30am. I didn’t get out of there until 12:30pm. I had my 6 year old daughter with me too. Store was completely empty .  No customers waiting or being helped. I was shocked at how bad John was.</review>< Date>

< Review>
I work in customer service too, but on my recent visit to the Clairemont location I noticed this man helping a customer I believe his name tag said Jeff, I noticed because he was very rude to the customer he was helping just his facial expressions said it all. I almost wanted to say something to him because as apart of my job in customer service we want to always make sure the customer leaves happy even though I know sometimes it can be impossible! Needless to say I did not purchase anything because his demeanor did not make me feel that he is confident in his job or maybe its not just the place for him. I will not shop at that location nor would I recommend anyone else not with someone who obiviously doesn't make a customer feel welcomed or cares. Maybe he needs better training on his job and customer service.<//Review>

Dr. Tammy Monck is very professional and extremely well knowledgeable with a great, wonderful attitude and made me feel very comfortable.

On the retail side, Mr. Lucas is very knowledgeable about the glasses with a lot of patience and a great, wonderful attitude which makes me bring more referrals to Mr. Lucas. Thanks.</text>

< Review>
I have been to the Point Loma location, but came to Clairemont because Rebecca is now the Manager of this store.  (Well deserved promotion, by the way.)  Rebecca is the most knowledgeable Optician I have ever worked with, and I have been wearing glasses for my whole life (59 years).  She REALLY knows her stuff!!!  She found me the best looking pair of glasses I have ever had,  last time I was in.  I have a really weird Rx, and she figured out a new type of progressive lens that works MUCH better than my old bifocals.  I am sooooo happy that Rebecca is back with EyeGlass World!!!  If you want GREAT service and a winning smile...Go see Rebecca!!!</Review>

I walked in with a prescription and within an hour had picked out a pair of glasses that I liked and were in my budget range.  The two ladies working were helpful without being pushy which I liked. When it was time for the lens selection they explained all the options and checked my insurance for coverage. It only took an hour and they were ready for pick up. It turns out the lens were not correct, and they needed to be special ordered which was not upsetting at all.  Danae apologized and quickly ordered the correct ones which would take a few days.  They just came in and she personally called to inform me.  I just picked them up and they are perfect.

Lesson learned: not everything is perfect the first time out, but they went out of their way to make a satisfied customer.  They were helpful, honest and professional.  I will tell anyone looking for great service to go see Danae...she is great!<//review>

Went in about 6 months ago, service was very good.  I ordered a pair of glasses I forgot to pick up for 6 months; walked in the other day and got them quickly with no delay.  Then I had to call and ask for receipts for healthcare reimbursement, Amelia Petersen was fantastic - she had to use her own phone to send the receipts to me but did so in about 2 minutes.  That is exceedingly rare service.< /text>

<Review>I had an appointment which they called to confirm twice the day before. During one of the confirmation calls they asked me to come in 10 minutes early to fill out paperwork etc so I would be able to be seen on time. I explicitly asked if I would be seen on time as I was on my lunch break. Fast forward to my appointment and I show up 15 minutes early and get started with paperwork. I finish just before my appointment and then wait another 15 minutes, the guy at the front desk is busy. After 15 minutes I ask him if it will be a while before I will be seen and he tells me it will be at least another half hour. At this point there is no way I am waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time. I ask him why they schedule appointments in the first place and he gives me some answer about how they get walk-ins and that I should call before to see if there will be a wait.

It is ridiculous that I had to wait at all but then for them to expect me to call to check the wait times when I have an appointment is worse. Just because you are a doctors office doesn't mean you get to overbook and waste other peoples time. Next time I will be scheduling fake appointments before my actual appointment just to make sure I get seen when I was scheduled to be seen.</Review><time>1526072181372</time><user>117425629299271407120<//user>< pics>

Very helpful Dr and staff. It was my first eye exam that I could even remember as an adult and they answered any questions that I had. Never realized how bad my vision was until they had set up the machine to where I could see clearly and then put it back to my current vision. Wow what an eye opener. I also was able to make a same day appointment. I called around 2:15 and by 3 I was already sitting in the exam room after doing some paper work as a first time patient .<//review>

< review>
I just want to start this off by saying, I have worked in customer service for several years and having experience as a patient care coordinator at a surgeons office, I understand there can be “off days” or “difficult” patients, however my experience today left me feeling absolutely uncared for. I came to the clairemont location for a contact lense exam. I have glasses but have never had contacts therefore I do not know anything about them. The man at the front desk and who did my pre-exam was friendly so no complaints there. The woman doctor who did my exam was fine. It wasn’t until she walked me out of the exam room and had me follow another girl to do the “contact lenses training” This young woman sits me down, doesn’t introduce herself, proceeds to set everything up. Once all is said and done she sits there in front of me and doesn’t direct me on any steps or what to do?! I have never worn contacts before so of course I’m lost. I ask her what to do and the whole time she had an attitude and seemed as if she had better things to do. It took me a good 30 min to get the contacts in and once I did she says “well it’s up to you if you want to take them out...” This training left me appalled. No instructions. No helpful information on what I’m even putting in my eye?? Or how to take care of the lenses. Every time I did ask a question she seemed very uninformed or maybe not properly trained. I was supposed to be scheduled a follow up but no one offered me one. They just checked me out and had me pay for my exam and sent me off...When I got home (literally 30 min. Ago) I called and scheduled my follow up appointment at the santee location instead of this one. I will not be going back to this location. Very unprofessional and rude employees. Maybe it was because it was a Monday but coming in there as a new patient and not knowing a single thing about contact lenses, I expected a bit of a better first time experience...<//review>

<date>1621304575123< /date><rating>4</rating><review>I think my experience at this place Is great  learning how to help people help myself at the same time. I pretty much love this job just dealing with people at a whole. Bing of service to the community is a great thing to do to help others. Being at nature and cleaning the environment put me at one with my community. I like to thank the people in charge  for giving me the opportunity to prove myself and responsibility to do so. I believe it begins with teamwork in my responsibility to do my part as a team member.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Park is clean and well maintained. Great watching the skateboarders doing their art. Lovely spot for lunch in an area of SF with very few parks.</Review>

<review>I met some amazing people at this park who helped me to learn how to skate. There are some great picnic spots and plenty of places to sit and lounge or socialize in the sun. There are murals and scribe in abundance. It is a pleasure to live so close to such an amazing park.<//review>< pics>

I understand it's an skate park but no one is helping other people well yes the people that are there to support is helping but everyone shouldn't have to do that there should be supervision!!! Kids are there they are also able to get hurt. There was an black lady that fell and started bleeding horribly!! They should have someone that can help/take care of the people that get hurt</Review>

Great skatepark!!! Nice bowls with pool style coping.  Plenty of street stuff for alot of fun, I always find something new to try here.  Clean  grass to lay in the sun to relax and watch people skate!!  Definitely worth it!!<//Review>

<user_name>Boris Moroz<//user_name><Text>My experience:
New in the area...My son wanted to check out this park. 5 minutes in the park and we see - 2 black guys around 23 - 25 attacking a white guy punching him and taking away his phone from a backpack. The white guy runs away and his girlfriend takes his skate board and follows him. Everyone else continue skateboarding  and having fun after a bit of a shock ...<//Text><rating>1</rating>< pics>

<Text>Surprisingly big park, with rolling grassy hills, skateboard park, community garden, and a play structure. Not the cleanest place - you can tell teens come at night to hangout and smoke. Had restrooms, but they were locked in the Sunday we were there. A bit noisy from the freeway.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f7e4c4d07e923:0x849003868e95955d<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
California's overlooked museum and underrated as well.
This place of historical significance was amazing.
Our tour guide is George and he was a wealth of information from each and every door, stairway, and room.
No pets allowed but fantastic job  by the friendly and well trained staff!!
If I could give more than five stars I would.
Thanks again George!!!!<//Review>

They have regular tours as well. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable and seem to enjoy working there.

Very interesting place i highly recommend it because it is the last civil war post in CA, but the guide we had was really condescending to my 9 year old that didn't know much about the civil war yet and she was OCD about making us move in a certain direction through the tour, and not touching anything at all except for the stair banister. She seemed like over the top about it. I thought she could have been a little more friendly towards my daughter she was obviously knowledgeable but no personality whatsoever and made my daughter feel like an idiot.</text>

The Last time I went was years ago, and I just want to say that this place has a lot of history behind it and if you want to know more about the history of Wilmington Ca. and know more about Phineas Banning and all this indeed is the place to come to for a plenty of history about Wilmington as well as the Drum Barracks Museum. It is really a neat museum as well as you can really learn a lot about this place and how Wilmington was founded and about this wonderful Museum. So if you would like some history about Wilmington Ca. and all Please come here to the Drum Barracks Museum you will get a lot of history as well as learn more about how Wilmington was founded. Please come here it is great. I also got to sing here for the founding of this place years ago and I was glad that I got to sing when this place was refounded. Thank you so much.</review>

It is a fascinating since we so often think very little of the Civil War in LA because, as a state, we where new to the nation.

We really enjoyed our Mother's Day Tea in the library at the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum.. The food, the music, the tea cups and staff made it a very special day. Looking forward to next years tea.< /Review>

<review>I had a beyond great experience with Travis. He hooked me up with tint all around on my Ram 1500 rebel, including the sun roof and the front windshield, all in the nano tint, and it came out fantastic. I would def recommend this place to anyone looking to get their vehicle tinted in Southern California. Call Travis and he will take great care of you the way he did with me.< /review>< Pics>

OC Tint is very professional on car window tint. My two cars get the tint in this location. My first installation works very well for about 3 years already and the temperature control still work as expected. The owner is very patient when help me pick the darkness of the tint, and he will recommend the right products but not only the expensive ones. Definitely will recommend this store to my friends.< /review>

I had my 2017 Mazda 6 car tinted over a year ago. The car originally bought the car with tint installed and they had no problem removing the old tint without damaging the rear defroster. A year later the film is holding up well with no signs of peeling. You can definitely tell the advanced nano ceramic film blocks quite a bit of the heat. I would recommend.</review>

<Text>If you want to know who does good work.....find a place that has a long wait line! Thats normally a good sign! I waited a few weeks (I was in no rush) to get my vehicle in for Ceramic - the process was as smooth and fresh as my truck looked when I picked it up!

Thank you Travis for the great experience - if my wife decides to get her SUV wrapped, i'm coming your way!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>OC Tint Shop is the best in the business.....hands down! Took my brand new 2021 Audi RS6 Avant in for recommendations and they did the rest.

<Review>OC Tint shop is the only place I bring my trucks. Guys are fair and fast! Dropped my 2017 Tacoma off at 9am and had it back before 1pm. They did a fantastic job. Travis also handled the tint on my 2004 Tacoma and busted out the camper shell.

<Text>OC Tint Shop is the best tinting service around. I've had plenty of tint jobs over the years and have been disappointed with the quality of the work and product. But these guys are excellent. I had a tint job completed on a 2020 mustang a year ago and the tint is still PERFECT. Not one single defect. Go see these guys and you won't be disappointed.<//Text><response>{'time': 1611076847257, 'text': 'Lindsay,\n\nThank you for your business and for taking the time to leave this review.

<GmapID>0x80dce902b2b4b7e9:0xfa9052322b547122<//GmapID>< Review>
Shopping for and comparing tint shops can be an overwhelming task. With an endless variety of films and shades, finding the perfect tint for my Model 3 was a big research project. Luckily, I found OC Tint Shop and had Travis to guide me through all of the details. Travis was great at explaining the different types of film (IR, crystalline, Nano, etc) and the benefits of each.

Their reputation is definitely earned. Browse through the photos here or their social media and you will see an endless catalogue of beautiful work and happy customers. If you are a Tesla owner, you know that our cars have tons of glass and delicate electronics, so it was important to me to find a shop that is experienced in dealing with the giant rear windows and windshield.

If you're looking for a shop that not only produces excellent quality work, but will treat you with honesty, fairness, and friendliness, then book your window tint with Travis and the team at OC Tint Shop. I'm already planning to go back for a PPF and chrome delete!< /Review>

Great service and quality work.  I went with the mid range product all the way around. I've always had tinted windows but this is the first time I've done the windshield and I'm happy I did. The car is so much cooler on hot days and no difference with visibility day or night driving.  Highly recommend OC Tint!!<//text>

<Text>The guys at OC Tint Shop do great work! The tint on my durango came out phenomenal and mirrorlike.  I got the advanced nanocermac IR and the difference is like night and day, literally.  It changed the look of my car for better and it blocks out the sun to a T. Travis was quick and responsive,  the job came out same day and ahead of schedule. Will definitely come back for future tints and wraps from these guys.

This company does an amazing job. I've had them tint my windows, put a clear bra on the front of the car and put a ceramic coating on the paint. Travis never tries to pressure sell. He simply discusses your needs and recommends what he believes is the best course of action and then he leaves it to you to decide.</Review>

OC Tint Shop, Travis and the entire staff  who work  here that I interacted with and performed the actual install of the tint on my daughters FJ were nothing but PROFESSIONALS.  They treat you and your vehicle with respect and results are perfect. I'm so satisfied with the experience that I'm bringing my FJ soon to get its'  windows tinted as well. Thank you and keep up the great job!<//review>

Great warranty. They guarantee they will take off replace them for free if you get a ticket. They will go as dark as you want and price and service was great deal. Highly recommend.< /text>

If you want the best to place in California to tint your vehicle go to OC tint shop for all your tint and wrap need. Hands down the best shop around. I did the 50% crystalline windshield and 5% tint all around. Couldn’t be happier with the results< /Review>

Not only do they carry the best material on the market, they were able to accommodate me the same day I inquired. My tint has been a LIFESAVER when traveling to and from the desert in a black car. I decided to go with an upgraded film to help reduce the amount of heat that comes into my car.

OC Tint shop is amazing. The speed they were awake to finish my car with was amazing. They are clearly perfectionist because the quality of work and service I received was hands down the best in Orange County.</Review>

I've done a mix of 5 and 35 percent of the satandard high performance tint on my civic 2018 here, three days ago. Travis took time to explain everthing to me. Their work is spotless and they did the job quick enough. Clear specification about their materials . They do offer free removal and redoing tints depending on what package you choose. Travis was helpful and perfossional. I was not quite happy with the pricing at the end but he accommodated my request to make me happy about the overall experience. Definitely Recommended!< /review>

Took my new car and they said I would be in 3hrs and after 4 hours I got there and they barely started, they bro mistreated the car because they where in a rush, broke some plastic parts, the tiny look good after a couple of days a looked at it closely and had some air bubbles on the back windows, for the price they charge seems worse than a 99 dollar tint shop<//review>

<Text>AVOID! Worst smoke shop anywhere (on either side of the country). The slow-witted mongrel stoners that that giggle in the backroom are useless, lazy, and lack basic communication skills. This shop has higher prices than any other store I've been to in the Bay Area. They won't allow you to return*defective* equipment that they sell and are happy to rip off their customers. Take your business literally ANYWHERE else.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

They're located in the back corner of the shopping center so easy to miss. Nice stage with various bands (awesome Jazz & Rock), good bar, and simple Mexican food menu. Lots of bigscreens for games when no live events. Food prices a bit high, and there is a 2-drink min. with an additional 20% gratuity on all tabs instead of cover charge. Took off a star because it can have that sticky/stale beer vibe on occasion.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB_sYHpFMk7MEPT_zHNQRm5qCV5bGc9iRmy_eG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>This is by far a hidden gem in Woodland Hills.  Tucked in the corner of a shopping center, this speak easy-esk establishment is small, welcoming, and provides top notch comedy talent on Mondays and Saturday nights.  Sit towards the front, there's tables for 2, 4 and more.  4-5 comedians visit the stage providing a plethora of humor.  No cover charge, 2 drink minimum, and plenty of FREE parking at the shopping center.  Don't think twice about it, just go!  You will have a wonderful evening of laughs.  It's next to the Thai restaurant in the corner of the shopping center.< /Review>< pictures>

It's the kind of place that when you wander in and wonder out loud why it took you so long to find it that the regulars around you put a finger to their lips and tell you to keep your find of this lovely place to yourself.  That is quite literally what happened to me on the first evening I took in a show at the Write Off.  Simply enchanting.< /text>

<date>1512870242537<//date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>WACO Theater Center....BY FAR, THE MOST OUTSTANDING ACTING SCHOOL I'VE BEEN TO.  Sorry for the CAPS, but with the training I've previously had in this business, Richard's "positive" approach & philosophies in building on one's strengths and discovering what sets you apart from others is truly an eye-opening experience within every class. In today's world with the advancements in technology that keep evolving and the accessibility to nearly anyone, I've seen first-hand how someone's life can change in a moment.  The ability to tap into every aspect of being an artist, whether that be as an actor, singer, musician, comedian, director, writer, producer, editor, public speaker, host, you name it, at "RLS" the possibilities are endless.  I'm honored to be a part of a truly wonderful community where everyone matters. The environment at Richard Lawson Studios is unequivocally a place "W.A.C.O." (Where Art Can Occur). My daughter is enrolled in The Young Artist's Program.  I cannot tell you how her confidence has grown. For instance, after only two classes she signed with an agent.  Thank you Richard and staff.  We've found my home. :-)</review>< Pics>

<Text>It was so awesome to just be in this beautiful theater.  Although Richard/Tina Lawson didn't make an appearance, it was nice to be in the theater to a sold out audience for 2 shows.  Thanks Chad Lawson Cooper.  Catch the play, Justice on Trial: Black Lives Matter Too!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I've always been impressed with the offerings of WACO & am sad I've only been once but I plan to become a regular. The place is beautiful from the art gallery lobby to the lavatory. I LOVE WACO!< /Review>

Intimate setting, comfortable seating.  You feel like you are part of the play. Close to eatery.  Street metered parking but free after 6 p.m.  Limited parking lot parking in the rear of the theater for $10.00< /Review>

This is the new home of Richard Lawson Studios where I take Acting and Producing classes. I study directly with veteran actor Richard Lawson. He teaches us how to ACT and also how to be "content creators". I have been with Richard Lawson for almost five years and in that time my career has expanded incredibly. This year I had a recurring role on Criminal Minds (Cassie Campbell) where I worked opposite Jane Lynch. Also I directed a feature length documentary "Curtsy, Mister" that just had it's North American Premier at the Harlem International Film Festival - we won the "Audience Award". Run, don't walk! - to study with Richard at the WACO (Where Art Can Occur) Theater Center.</review>

I hiked up Mount Baldy with two friends yesterday, this time I picked up Old Baldy Trail instead of two others options to climb up the summit. This trail is very hard which is 14.6 miles round trip with around 5800 ft elevation gain, especially the terrain is rocky and loose, some of the sections are so steep. But the reward was we were be able to see cloud sea like what we could see from a airplane, it was so beautiful and spectacular.</text>

What great place. This whole area is a dream come true for anyone who wants to get out and adventure. Any outdoor activity can be had. Please be kind: pack it in, pack it out. Smokey and Woodsie appreciate.<//Text>

Thomas and your installers, for both carpet and the vertical blinds couldn't of been nicer and professional. Thomas is very friendly and easy to talk to.He has kept my wife and I completely informed with when the installation was going to take place, which was very important to us so the joint meet could take place. Thank you Thomas, greatly appreciated! Will always recommend Alpine Carpet One to others for their future installs and let them know your reputation. Thanks again!<//Review>

<text>Thomas provided us with prompt and expert service in carpeting our new home.  The new carpet is gorgeous and luxurious.   The installation of carpet and padding was seamless.  We are very pleased with the results and will be back to Alpine the next time we need new carpeting.  We recommend the business highly.<//text>< Pics>

They took great care of us. Submitted a request online and was called the next business morning. Mike was awesome. He listened to my needs and had someone out at the perfect time for us, and they installed next day! Seriously just use them, no need to shop around any longer!< /review>

<Review>We have worked with Alpine on several occasions.  They are always very professional and easy to work with.  They installed new carpet for us in 2019.  We got a small burn mark in front of the fireplace last winter.  Carlos came out and did such an amazing job on the repair that I could not even find the spot when he was done.  Highly recommend!!</Review>< rating>

<review>Incredibly satisfied with this carpet transaction and installation!  Their staff was very easy  to work with on the front end, selecting a carpet type and color.  Their onsite measurements guaranteed an economic purchase with very little overage. (A bonus at the end was their willingness, for free,  to bind a 2’x3’ “scrap” into a floor mat next to our deck. )

The trustworthy installers arrived on time, communicated well with us and did incredible work, assisting us with furniture moving, working around bi-fold doors and such.  They did a great job working into the evening to guarantee that we were satisfied with their installation and clean up. I’d recommend Alpine Carpets without reservation.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Thomas helped us with new LVP flooring for our condo in Kirkwood.  He directed us through Carpet One's on-line sample program and we had six styles to choose from.  Thomas handled all the measurements, the ordering, the delivery and the installation.  It was great..we have also recommended Thomas and Alpine Carpet to several friends in the Tahoe area.< /Text>

It is my pleasure to give Alpine Carpet One a FIVE STAR review.  We walked into the store on a Saturday to browse new flooring for our SLT home. Caitlyn gave us excellent options. And we really loved a commercial luxury vinyl product - 2002V TITAN HD PLUS in 05037 MODERN OAK. After doing a price check in our local bay area Carpet One store, we called Caitlyn to see if they could do a price match on the product (since our preference is always to shop local). Caitlyn's boss, Paul, got back to us - and not only price matched, but went 1cent less! We placed the order. Paul contacted the manufacturer to see if the flooring would be ok if we opted to put extra padding. (Manufacturer's recommendation was not to put it.) Paul let us know about the delivery schedule (during these trying SIP times, shortages are normal) - a week out for the flooring and another week out for the stairs. Paul got our order delivered to us on time. Other than our initial visit, our transaction and follow up was done via the phone and electronically.
You cannot go wrong with choosing Alpine Carpet One for your flooring needs. Great options. Fabulous customer service. Knowledgeable - with research with manufacturer for finer details. Excellent communication. Pleasure to do business with.<//text>

<review>After a HORRIBLE experience with Romanoff Renovations I spoke with Michael Meyers from Alpine Carpet One. From beginning to end I had a great experience. Michael was very professional and eager to help with my installation. Chad, the installer, was amazing! Chad showed up on time and did a great job! Chad is honest, trustworthy, professional, and very knowledgeable. These are traits not common of contractors in this area. I strongly recommend Alpine One to anyone! I would also recommend that you ask for Chad to do your installation.</review>< pictures>

A wonderful experience- again. Thomas and his crew jumped in and did several smaller jobs in record time. Then gave me great advice when picking out the carpet for the entire upstairs. The installers could not have been more impressive. I am not the easiest to please and I was thrilled with their service & the results. Most impressive!!</Text>

<Text>Last year we used Alpine to install some luxury vinyl and carpet. This month we had a flood in two bedrooms from a burst pipe and Mike Boles came out to evaluate the situation for us. He was very honest and compassionate and rather than upselling, he told us we would be able to salvage the carpet!!
Mike even loaned us a high-powered fan so that we could dry the carpeting out really good before the reinstall process.Very promptly, technicians came out to glue the backing and install a new pad and reinstall the carpeting. They were very professional and we recommend this company absolutely!<//Text>< pictures>

Amending my prior review: After a “not ideal” experience, I was reached out to by the owner of Alpine Carpet and amazingly he went above and beyond to correct all of the issues, explain the unusual circumstances that lead to our issues, and repair the prior work that we were unsatisfied with.

As a result, I have nothing but positive things to say. The attention to detail, clear communication, and willingness to come back to ensure the work was corrected months after the job was completed has ensured that when we are ready to do the next phase of our flooring/carpet home improvement project, we will be contacting Alpine right away.

Thank you again for the beautiful work.<//review>

I desperately needed the floor of an entire apartment replaced immediately. I called and explained the situation to Thomas (the kindest man ever) he got in his truck and came over to get measurements and to give me an affordable quote. He then immediately began the job, completed above and beyond expectations, by end of business next day. I could not be more grateful for there assistance. What a pleasure from beginning to end. THANK YOU.< /review>

I've had State Farm Ins for a good long while. I'm reminded why I value their service every time either my wife or I call in for service Last week I needed to insure a new property. I worked with Stephanie Guzman to figure out what all I needed to insure - in this case less than everything I might have insured. She also coordinated the Insurance start date with the purchase date that turned out to be a moving target. Thank you, Stephanie.

6/24/2021 Update: I just purchased a new car to replace an older one but I haven't sold the older one yet.  Just found out that when you insure the new car, State Farm will still insure the older car for 30 days at no cost while you are trying to sell it!  That's a pretty good deal. Thanks Sarah for letting me in on this little secret!  Also thanks Dave for the education on insuring a salvaged vehicle.<//text>

We've been with State Farm (Dave Nugent office) for years now and it's mainly Thanks to Amanda Strickland and her expertise. Amanda has always managed to find us the best savings that fit our families needs & budget. Her professionalism and quick response to our questions are some of the main reasons we currently have our Home, vehicles, & Life insured with State Farm.<//text>

Sarah at State Farm is fantastic! She goes above and beyond to help my needs as well as multiple friends and family that I’ve referred to her. she is 100% completely an asset to the Dave Nugent team and I would hope big things are on her horizon. If her hard work is being noticed by me just a basic customer then I can’t imagine how much her coworkers love her. if I can give 10 stars I would!<//Review>

<review>Dave came to my home and took pictures of everything back to the office to work up some quotes. He sent those to me via e-mail.
My oldest son went with me to their office where we met with Sam Rodriguez (Agent)and went over those quotes. Sam re-worked them for me and added an Earthquake policy.
He took care of canceling my old policies and notifying my mortgage company.
I left there feeling great. I now had the proper Home Insurance with a Company I felt good about, Agent I liked, and in my neighborhood.<//review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1616005701708, 'text': 'Sharrn thank you VERY MUCH for this terrific review and for your business.

< review>
Let's be honest...no one likes paying for insurance.  However, if you are going to pay it, at least work with a group of awesome professionals who are great at their job, nice to talk with and super helpful.  Today I called Sarah to pay my premiums, and ask some additional questions.  From my questions, she suggested making some changes which would increase my coverage and maybe even save some money at the same time.  Sarah and Dave's whole team are top notch, A++, 5-Star!</review>

<text>I called Dave's office, again today.  And again, come away thankful for their kind understanding of whatever issue I have, and their response to my stated needs.  Today Stephanie G. was supportive, suggested a plan of action, researched options, and got back to me with positive resolution from the home office as well as reassurance that I'm not the only one out there with the problem I encountered.  It felt like I was in good hands with a good neighbor who was really there.  This past few years I have had direct support and timely responses from Sam, Christine, Maggie, and of course Dave.

I found Dave Nugent's office when I moved to Lodi some years ago. They were so responsive and helpful, completely opposite to the service I had (not) received at my previous agency. I was so happy with their service I stayed with them when I moved out of the area later. In my latest move, Stephanie Guzman was so helpful and attentive it reaffirmed my decision to stay with this office, despite now being located more than 400 miles away. They are simply the best. Unbeatable. Thank you Stephanie!<//Review>

We have been with State Farm for several years now. Our agent Amanda has been so amazing. She is super responsive, always helpful, and supports all of our family's insurance needs! I recommend them to anyone I get the chance to! Thanks, Amanda!< /review>

I have been with this State Farm office for many years, and always receive
prompt responses, courteous service, answers to any questions or concerns, and great follow-up.  Most recently, Sarah Hamlin has been working with me on my renewal, which involved a physical inspection update this year.  This happened to coincide with the Covid-19 pandemic and need for social distancing, etc., as well as the time of year I do clearance for defensible space.  Sarah worked with me to time the visit without adding an extra burden to an already difficult year.  If she needed to follow-up, she did, and always got back to me in a reasonable time frame.  Working together,  we were able to successfully complete a thorough update, that assured State Farm I had met all safety issues and codes since their last physical visit.  I would highly recommend this office.  I also appreciate the  discount for years of loyalty.<//Text>

Shopping around for car and rental insurance has always been a hassle but Stephanie Guzman made it easy and convenient. She was very informative about my options and was quick at giving me same day quote. She explained what options were convenient and affordable for my family and I. The best customer service hands down.<//text>

I have been with this particular State Farm office for 10+ years all together with State Farm a member for 30+years.  Staff have always been kind and understanding while attending to my needs such as resolving claims or issues in a timely manner.  Staff are season and very familiar with policies and procedures and if they don't know the answer, they will find it.  I rely on sound guidance from Amanda, Sarah, Sam and of course Dave the owner.  All are there to help and support you in time of crisis or expanding on your insurance needs.</review>

Very well ran insurance office. You can expect a professional attitude and to always be treated as a valued customer. My highest recommendation goes out to Sarah Hamlin. Any time I call with a question or problem she has an expert solution along with a very friendly attitude. She has saved me money on countless occasions and always remains available and diligent with all my customer needs. As long as Sarah works for Dave I will remain a loyal customer. Thank you</Review>

Quit wasting your time and go see the best, Dave and his team will treat you like family. Sam at the office will set you up with a nice life insurance policy you can afford and make sure your loved ones are taken care of when your long gone.<//review>

<text>Switched to Dave and Amanda some months back. Very happy and saving a lot....maybe as high as 25-30% LESS for the same coverage levels for home and auto.

Most importantly when I call someone gets back to me quickly!

Definite 5 stars!<//text>< Pictures>

First off I want to say how awesome it's been having Mr. Nugents office as my state farm insurance provider. But I really want to give a huge!!! And i mean absolutely huge shout out to Sarah Rhoads( Hamlin). Shes always super professional and on top of it. No hassle whatsoever and does her job with tremendous grace and integrity. I wont ever go anywhere solely because of her in that office. Not to say that the rest of them their aren't good either, but she makes my life super easy when it comes to my insurance. 😁. I highly recommend that office for your State Farm Insurance</review>

< Review>
Samuel Rodriguez @ Dave Nugent’s State Farm Office    Deserves to be recognized as one of the most helpful and efficient Insurance account representatives I’ve ever delt with. He makes the experience enjoyable.
His customer service is #1. Sam has helped me with home owners policy’s and business insurance. He definitely has my business. When Samuel Rodriguez helps he makes you feel like family. Thank You Sammy.< /Review>

Samuel gave me some valuable information on life insurance and by the end of the visit, I purchased life insurance. Very great group of people in that office. Very friendly and very professional.

State farm really is the best, they recently helped me out of a problem when my car broke down. AAA wouldnt tow my car because my tags were out of date by 2 months so they just left me stranded but State farm came through no questions asked. I'm grateful to be with such a good company who actually care about people. Every time I call Sara answers the phone and she's always so sweet and helpful. Dave, Sara and team are the best!< /Review>

<review>Amzng customer service from Samuel Rodriguez! Whenever I have questions about my auto policy or about rate increases I just give him a call and he always provides me with an answer right away. He is always trying to find me discounts that have greatly decreased my monthly bill and he's helped me better understand my coverage. He takes the time to help me out and make sure I'm properly covered. I highly recommend calling him for a quote!</review>< Response>

<Text>Great staff at this office! I have bugged one young lady for weeks now with different questions and not once has she been annoyed or not answered emails. They are always friendly and prompt whenever I need anything, and again, I can't say enough about the service level - it's important to me when doing business with others that the level of service received is top notch, and they've hit the mark every time.< /Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< gmap_id>

When we got in our accident last year, they helped us through the claim process and all of the stress and paper work that came with it. It’s nice to know that in stressful times, this office is here for us. I couldn’t be more thankful to Dave and this team! If you are looking for a welcoming place to get some of the products that matter most, do yourself a favor and go see them. You won’t regret it!<//Text>< pics>

Excellent costumer service! I worked with Maggie and she was able to answer all my questions and helped me with everything I needed. She is very nice and I would recommend her or State Farm to anyone who is looking for a new insurance agency.< /text>

We moved our car and home insurance policies to Dave's office after being absurdly neglected by our previous agent (did not input our change of address, lost our multi-policy discount, lots of other issues). Dave responded immediately to my first phone call, and quickly got us back on track. As a State Farm customer for over 60 years I can say with great conviction, Dave and his entire office are the best! Thank you Dave!</Text>

< Review>
Although I’m not a customer I would like to leave a review for this office, a few days ago i was stranded with a flat tire and late for an appointment, luckily Sammy an employee of this office was nearby and offered to assist, within a few minutes he had my flat off and replaced. He did tell me all about the benefits of being a StateFarm customer and I am definitely going to look into it especially when StateFarm employs people like him.< /Review>

So far, I haven't had any issues there, I love my storage unit, I wish I could live in it! It's always clean and quiet there; well, not always quiet if people are moving into their units but for the most part it is quiet. The office manager usually comes around if he hasn't seen your vehicle in a while just to check and make sure it's you. They spray for bugs and keep the place tiny.<//Text>

<review>Received amazing customer from Bob. We went in looking for small storage unit which are currently all occupied. He quickly helped us set up at another location nearby. Helped us with the paperwork and the payment, explained everything and made sure we understood everything before signing. All we needed to do is go to the other location and check out our unit. Made the process so much easier. Thank you Bob!< /review>< Pics>

Today started out very stressful. I previously rent a storage unit but did not realize I had to climb a ladder (ugh!). I had to let that go. As I sat by the road upset, I saw Extra Storage on Acacia. I walked in and was immediately greeted (very rare nowadays). I told the gentleman what I needed and he went above and beyond to assist me. Bob Shultz, walked me to my unit and we completed the paperwork. He explained everything step by step. I left with no questions. I felt my items were safe and he was a person I could contact in the future. Thanks, Bob!< /Text>

Facility is always clean and safe. Staff is always friendly. Rex the facility manager is amazing! He is incredibly helpful, accommodating, and attentive. The man definitely understands his job and is exceptional at doing it. If anyone is in need of a storage unit, I highly recommend using this facility.<//review>

<Text>Nicest storage In hemet by a Longshot. Very clean, super safe, easy to get in and out with any size vehicle,  would use them again if we need storage, You can rent online and right now they're throwing a new lock in an unopened package  in the deal just to make it even more convenient.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I went here looking for a extra large storage space and they were very accommodating to me and within 10 minutes I was ready to go, had a new lock, which I really like it was a combination lock not a key lock and then when I was leaving they gave me a shield to wear over my face mask. It was definitely a fast process and painless just what I was looking for</text>< pictures>

I reserved my space prior to my interaction. I greet the man inside who introduced himself as Rex. He then explained what they had available and what best fitted my needs. All along being kind charismatic and realistic I then went to finalize the deal and my card declined due to a chip malfunction I then explained I would return and he did not rush me or urge me to do another payment I returned an hour later with my wife we seen him picking up around the property. He greeted and treated exactly the same as myself. Excellent Service!! And By Rex’s Work I Would Say Great Employees.< /Text>

I found Extra Space storage here on Acacia to be an excellent place with a good variety of spaces at reasonable prices. There are great online specials too that vary upon availability.
The staff are friendly and hospitable...Rex and Braden are always so welcoming with a big smile. They are both very accommodating and helpful. Rex always helps me find the best space for my family’s needs. I am so happy with the unit I have here. I feel truly grateful and blessed with a storage space that is in a great location, easy drive up access, secure and overall a very clean facility. Thank you for your service.<//review>

<review>I appreciate all the help that Rex gave me as a new customer. He made me aware of the specials that were going on and was polite and kind. I downsized my unit and he brought cold water because it was hot outside. I would recommend this Extra storage to all my friends and family. the units are clean and easy to get in and out of. Five stars to Rex, he's amazing and Extra Storage.< /review>< Pictures>

Wow a man I barely know asked me to write a review on his performance so I sit here and ponder what to write about a man I barely even though so I'll simply tell you the exactly how I felt leaving this extra space storage.

my life has many difficulties at the moment and in the very darkest of moments when times are most difficult you must seek the light and my light happened to be a man named Rex that works for the storage facility as my days became more and more confusing one thing is for sure some people still care as I walked into the storage facility the very first thing I noticed in this facility is the exceptionally immaculate facility I was greeted with the warmest of smiles from the manager which his name is Rex and his employee.

I was treated like family when I was there which is remarkable in these times in short I just want to say that this man brightened up my day and every time I see him he's always got a warm smile and something beautiful to say I appreciate him very much as he's become special to me even though he may not know that I guess in essence I'm trying to say that good people still exist thank you for your diligent work there at the facility Rex I appreciate you more than words could say

Sincerely yours current tenant</Review>

<review>Extra Space is the Best Place!!!  Extended gate entry hours make it easier to beat the summer heat. Units are clean and the staff knows how to adjust the roll-up doors to work properly. The office has a variety of quality moving supplies at reasonable prices...boxes, plastic covers, tape, locks, etc. When I needed a second unit, they were able to get me into one next to my first unit, which really simplified my visits. Security cameras provided additional safety to me and my belongings and staff always checked on me when I was there. They know who is coming and going. When I forgot to lock one unit, nothing was missing or damaged. Staff secured the unit ASAP and made numerous attempts to notify me. Greatly appreciated! All the staff are kind, courteous, and honest. Rex provided awesome customer service. Thanks guys!!!< /review>< Pictures>

I knew it was the exact facility for me! Rex quickly gave me an overview of the procedures Extra uses and showed me several units one of which was perfect! The unit and the entire faculty was very clean and maintained! I received first class service and very professional service and will recommend the Acacia Ave Extra  Storage to all my Hemet friends!!!

<Text>Rex did a great job setting up my account,
First time here at self storage. Painless & easy- I recommend self storage to anyone looking to get a unit let it be for 1 month or more.

The facility on Acacia Ave is very clean and well maintained. The Store Manager Rex Hofelter is very efficient. He explained everything thoroughly and quickly and made us feel confident about our items being secure. Definitely one of the best storage facilities in Hemet and we will recommend it to our friends and family..<//Review>

It was hot as you know what and Dustin was still willing to show me 4 different spaces to make sure I was getting the one that beat met my needs and price range. Thanks for the personalized service. When I arrived he had other people in the office and he was the only person working in the office but this polite young man still gave me a big friendly hello, offered me some cold water and invited me to have a seat in the waiting area until he was finished. A+service<//Review>

Rex is great! He helped me set up my storage unit in no time and was not only friendly, but efficient. On the grounds during our tour of the units, I was amazed at the cleanliness of the place! Rex got me the best deal possible and saved me money which at this point in time during a stressful move was completely invaluable!< /review>

Honestly I would recommend coming to this extra space storage and ask for a nic guy named Rex. He walks and explains you every well he is kind and always has a smile on his face when he is talking. I do recommend extra space and if you want good service just ask for Rex the store manager.< /text>

<Text>I buy and sell storage units so I have been to a lot of facilities and met a lot of management but the customer service I received from Rex and Bob caught me off guard. Never have I come across a facility and staff of this caliber. Bob was the first interaction we encountered and even being new he did is job spot on and if he didn't know the answer to a question he went and found out unlike a lot of new employees who might just give you an answer to satisfy. (I was a manager 10 years one of biggest problems I had with new employees.) Then we met the manager the following morning and for once it seemed like a member of management was happy to be at the job. He has a great personality very accommodating and even has a sense of humor which is hard to keep about you in that line of work with all the colorful people you encounter. But most of all the facility itself is beautifully maintained. No random debree in isles or bent crappy latches on doors which we are all to familiar with. Overall I highly recommend this location and staff to anyone who wants an eased mind when storing their belongings keepsakes or inventory and a professional staff that's par to none. Kudos guys.<//Text>< response>

<Review>Robert and Rex have great customer service. If more employees were that way business would prosper more in meny ways. They made me feel like my belongings were protected not just stuff to lose. I'm glad I was able to deal with human beings who care about there well being as much as someone else's, but still stay company men</Review>< response>

Came in today to do a remote lease for a unit in Arizona. I was privileged to have Rex walk me through the process. He did a walk thru of the same size unit i would be leaseing to give me an idea of the space size. He was and was very informative and knowledgable. Would hands down recommend their service. Come in and ask for Rex!< /Text>

<review>Robert and Rex have great customer service. If more employees were that way business would prosper more in meny ways. They made me feel like my belongings were protected not just stuff to lose.

Rex went above and beyond to help me back in my trailer to my parking spot and making sure the area around my trailer was free of garbage. This property is very clean and the parking spots are prefect a great size for what you might need to park.  Thank you again rex,  and extra space great customer service.</review>

<user>106043474165004288028<//user><review>Before extra space storage took over the facility was always clean and the staff was so nice. Since then the facility is a mess and the staff is far more concerned with sending emails and  making harassing phone calls in the middle of the work day, dispite being asked numerous times to stop calling.< /review>< Rating>

Most cold hearted and uncaring manager (Shelley) I have EVER had the misfortune of dealing with! Get your stuff out and/or NEVER rent from this place! She doesn't have a compassionate bone in her body. Cold, vile,  disgusting so called human being!</review>
