<Time>1621574874562<//Time><rate>5<//rate><Review>The best things in life always survive, including Atami Sushi.  We have been going to Atami since 1999, and this family run business continues to maintain high quality delicious sushi with a friendly comfortable atmosphere.  Michelle and Wiley always make you feel welcome when you arrive and they remember your favorite selections.  The sushi is always fresh, the service is quick, and Michelle always keeps the restaurant extremely clean.  They have had a tough time fighting through the Covid shutdowns, so if you are in the neighborhood and want some great sushi in a cozy and friendly restaurant, you should stop on by and pay them a visit.  Also, this is a rarity in SF, but they have several parking spots for those coming from farther away.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeI05jg43UhuIA0T6t1u1REjx0FQNGUzJzm-r2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmQGXXeYHkR1Hdl11p1ONRPzHJ3GSpkpTHJOAJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvA5zCkqCtbzwnF3tU30DiyZYfrRZvkY6wfO0r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNM47pXt6TOAF0-zWW98yYkNAch-K8WvoWxwPAM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlZPSzpYLfIRKCDB11asJr-j9ATqgE6hMLUt8w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4HSEU23YcZ8xFCY21ovGxGAUumhXPC1rr5WJ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMajpKvF2HkowDqC3NRH55yQjYyojL4NKdSvijy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<text>I love it! Fresh, fresh, fresh! Quiet and flavorful. So far... every time, everything it's been delicious!
Just adding a couple pictures.
I've been here probably 20+ times over the past 5 years and the quality is 10 out of 10 every single time.
Perhaps they have some days when food takes longer to reach your table but that's because it's a little owners run restaurant.
There aren't many places left where food is prepared and served by its owners.
This place delivers quality every.single.time.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjL72knPqR0GA7TCKAOrcQXxE8FRrcb0HQ8mGH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxIhBrPia9O4l4SdiU8hqw2amM1zsAQMk2yNdG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

<review>This is a great experience, a bar type setting you can stand in line for a few minutes and be seated for freshly rolled sushi. The pre-selected menu offers 5 rolls at $17.50 which is extremely worth it. I had yellowtail, salmon, blue crab, lobster and scallop. I would go back in a heart beat. Great service and the best sushi I've ever had.< /review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My favorite restaurant on the planet. I have eaten here with friends and family at least 50 times and always had an excellent experience. This is a small family owned restaurant with amazing and authentic Japanese sushi. Yes, the portions are on the smaller site but the quality of the ingredients and the love of the owners for their customers more than makes up for this.
On some nights the service can be slow but just bring time and you won't be disappointed. This restaurant is all about taste and flavor, unlike so many Bay Area restaurants that sell mediocre food in a hipster ambiance for the same price.<//Review>

< Review>
The best nigiri in SF! The chef really has an eye for picking out great fish. It’s a family run spot, and Michelle the waitress is the sweetest. I’ve been coming here forever and bring everyone that visits. Try the Blue Hawaii roll, Stripe Jack nigiri, and of course Sake nigiri that goes down like butter.
For those saying it’s slow, it’s made to order, don’t rush perfection.<//Review>

Great local place that’s quiet and with excellent service. Best sushi I’ve had in the US. Fish is of excellent quality. Only thing I’d ding them on is that the spider roll I had was only average, but nigri was all excellent. Also note that at least when I went there they didn’t open the door until 5:05 and didn’t serve food until 530, but I had no where to go so it worked for me. If you’re in a rush I’d order for take out instead< /Text>

We ran all the way to find this restaurant and only until we then realize it’s closed. It’s Tuesday, 2 day from Thanksgiving, and both Google Maps and Yelp says it’s open. And no close notice on the wall.

The owner should really do a good job to notice users!!!< /Text>

<Review>Absolutely incredible meal. The portions were a little small and it wasn’t a cheap dinner but it was also some of the best sushi I’ve ever had - and we lived in Vancouver. The server was also an absolute sweetheart. What a gem of a place - DEFINITELY worth it!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808580dc6e49ad11:0x60e45ffb6f3910a1</gmap_id></record>

Food excellent. Service leaves something to be desired. Edamame well salted. Shrimp tempura roll was warm from the fryer. Delicious ratio of ingredients. Sashimi was fresh tasting. Soft shell crab was delightful.< /review>

Great sushi.  Comfortable atmosphere with a cozy and friendly seating area.  Very satisfactory quality sushi and fairly priced.  I had a rainbow roll, and eel and red snapper nigiri.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x808580dc6e49ad11:0x60e45ffb6f3910a1</GmapID><text>I agree with Ian H: great sushi without the obnoxious scene.  The restaurant is set back from Lombard Street, behind a little stone garden and, while not ornately  decorated, is quiet and clean.  Service can be a little leisurely (usually because Michelle, an owner, is the only one serving tables) but the food is great.  The fish is quite fresh: sashimi pieces are smaller than you see at most restaurants but it's good stuff.  I don't usually order rolls when eating sushi but Atami's rolls use interesting fish (say no to Alaskan Rolls of salmon and cream cheese!) and are presented nicely.  Great sushi restaurant in a neighborhood of hits and (mostly) misses.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Exceptional sushi and sashimi. We talked to the waitress for a long time. Exquisite person. From the outside it is not as beautiful and extraordinary as it seems. Miso soup to try.

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>The showers were nice, clean and spacious. Someone stole my shoes there and the staff / guests were extremely rude entirely due to being transgender. I experience discrimination everywhere I go. Community resources for homeless are not a place where it should take place because it is meant to be a last resort for help. You guys should be ashamed. How would you feel if people were rude and/or threatened/stole from you based on your outward appearance? Sound familiar?</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>I haven't been to this location yet but I heard it's very helpness in people need due to homeless like shower public laundry washing and charing outlets to charge your things. I'm gonna go today for the first so I hope it's a smooth calm inviroment. And not so getto. Just because they offer this free service some people can be ungrateful for there free help and be disrespectful and I think that is very unexceptionable especially cause and they don't have help the like this.<//review>< gmapID>

I dropped my friend off at this place so that she could do her laundry for free. They also have free bathrooms, showers 24 hours a day.

And if you go between 7AM and 7PM they allow you to do 1 load of your laundry and let you use their charging stations for your electronics.

Its amazing places like this exist.  I only used the bathroom and charged my phone while I waited for her to do her laundry.

They also take donations, I gave them a couple bags of clothes and hygiene items and they were very grateful.

While I waited, I watched this amazing artist freehand draw the most incredible piece of art, just breath taking work!

This place is located in skid row and the area looks intimidating but the people that go there and the employees are good people.< /Text>

<text>For the most part the staff there are very much so respectful and attentive to the job at hand. But today on a more relaxed day a staff member was putting people into the showers before others who've been there for hours. People have more important things to do than wait 2 and a half hours for a ten minute shower</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1559793394428, 'text': "We're extremely sorry that this has happened to you we will do our best to ensure that this matter is addressed."}</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c76490991507:0xa97a4c361de72659<//gmap_id></record>

Okay place to do laundry. Clean. Some workers are needlessly rude.. I asked one for the time, and she couldn't be bothered.. she has stuff on her face and yellow specks in the soles of her sneakers.. she keeps giving me really dirty looks for no reason too..  it is a business.. i get the customer base is less than desirable but they knew that going in.. be nicer to your customers.. 5 for cleanliness given the place and situation..< /review>

Everything that is said about it; it is true for people can take showers 24 hours a day and wash their clothes during the day. The staff also offers tours and information for those who are new to or who do not feel safe in the forbidden land- skid row.<//review></record>

<Text>I've called twice to donate boxes of hygiene products and the phone number listed is to a Google Voice phone number. I'm not sure if the information listed online is correct, but if others are calling and are getting the same response, then sadly there are a lot of donations being missed out on.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c76490991507:0xa97a4c361de72659<//gmapID></record>

I was about to drink water when the staff asked what i was about to do lol i had just showered and have had attitude from this staff member before i will follow up with his name.

One of Los Angeles worse places. I'm personally embarrassed that people visit our lovely city and have to witness such filth. Crime-ridden, drugs sold right in the open. Aggressive panhandlers everywhere. The potential of becoming a victim of violence is extremely high. I would recommend staying away from this area.< /text>

< Review>
The women that work there are very rude to me for no reason. Especially  the older lady who does the laundry. They make it hard for the homeless to get the essential  services that the spot try to provide. I don't know what there problem with me was because I never really  spoke to anyone I just sat there and waited for my turn to recipe shower laundry or restroom service but the young women that work there are just horrible. And I never really even said much to them i hope i never hAve to use the refresh spot again.... da13< /Review>

First and foremost I do not review quality of food with quick service and fast food restaurants, unless absolutely terrible. The food here was fine. The lack of customer service got me. No greeting, no thank you, just bare-minimum customer service, especially on digital order pick-up.< /review>

<rating>3</rating><review>I can only do 3 Stars because the quesadillas went from 5 star to way less because is now folded into a square  before they heat it up,placing the cheese and meat only in the middle (more like a burrito) so when you open it there's no cheese or meat on the sides of the quesadilla so in reality you're having 2 pieces as a quesadilla when before you could have 4 so the two outside corners is just the flat tortilla no cheese or nothing and you're supposed the name what sides you want with it can't have it by itself, the flavor is there sides are great and taste is great but is no longer a quesadilla shaped item is more like a burrito.I hope they shape it back to a quesadilla .<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<name>Osiris Elias<//name><Text>Ordered at 230 and chose the quickest option which was 245. (Maybe that was my mistake) I got there at 250 and they did not have it ready which is fine by me. Waited about 10 minutes and got it warm so that made me happy. Once I bite into it i remembered why I stopped eating chipotle. The rice was undercooked..it was as if they just threw in rice without cooking it. The black beans were semi cooked. I didn't finish it.

Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere even if you're in a rush. Theres a good taco spot down the street.< /Text>< Pictures>

This Chipotle is a surprise everytime I come here. Who ever it is that prepared the might must love a lot of salt.  I come here more then a handful of times throughout this year.  More then half those times 6 - 8 times me and aswell as other people have complained that the chicken was over salted. I will not be going here ever again. Do yourself a favor and don't spend your dollar here unless you want a mouth full of salt.<//Review>

<review>This chipotle made me feel very welcome. Carlos and Jennifer went out of their way to ensure I was satisfied. I dined in, and they even went so far as to come out to me and ask how everything was and what they can do to enhance my time here. Incredible, really. The food was fresh and whoever made those chips did a phenomenal job. Came just for the food, left happy from the service. Well done.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This is the best Chipotle I've been to in ages. Everything was made well, burritos were rolled tight, and they even cut me a lime when I asked for one on the side. Go here, not to any other local chipotle.< /Text>

<Review>I came to pick up my food at 5; 10pm in the evening. The lady at the front desk told me to wait after reading my mobile phone order. I waited until 5:40pm. I urged again. Then she went to help me verify it. Then told me that my meal was be  taken by another people.   Let me solve the remaining problems by myself. Does your restaurant not verify guest information when taking meals? Does your staff even have the least sense of responsibility. Just wait and wait. I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know  . It's terrible. Even if it's starving to death. I won't come again. Too irresponsible staff.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

Chipotle needs to invest in better food containers. This is the 2nd time the container leaks liquid and rips the bag causing my food to spill out all over, including all over me.< /Review>

On 02/20 the steak was overcooked and the rice was crunchy. Not at all enjoyable espcially when you end up vomiting with stomach pain. First time I thought it was a fluke but after the second time I'm done with this nonsense.<//text>< UserId.>

I was pleasantly surprised at the service I received while visiting. It does take a lot to keep a business like this afloat and while making customer service your top priority, some may see this as challenging. I would definitely return as they rank high marks with me on the appearance and maintenance side.<//Review>

<Review>Personally for me, if I order on the app, or I order through a delivery service, nothing’s correct. There are always things missing, and it’s frustrating. The store in general, some women who work there hella judge you. And the meat there is not that great of quality because they don’t trim the fat. I ordered a burrito bowl yesterday, and half the meat was just fatty chunks that made me gag. Stick to the one in orange or Fullerton.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Went in about 9:20pm in my civilian clothes, I ordered my food to go, and asked for  the law enforcement discount. The lady on the counter stared at me for a second with a pretty judgemental look on her face and told me that I had to be in uniform like the 2 officers that had just walked in. I showed her my badge and everything. Pretty dissapointing since I never got that treatment before. Other chipotle locations never did this to me. Just because in my civilian clothes I don't look like a first responder I shouldn't be getting judged like that. She did give me the discount, I just didn't like the treatment.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcd65ad94b0e97:0x974324192de09478< /GmapID></record>

I am beyond speechless Leaving this  restaurant. I had came in a couple times before and got good and great service but when I came in with my 5 year old son and got the kids meal and a chicken barito they probably notice that I wasn't really paying attention to the questions they were asking me and I apoligize for holding up the line. I told them I had a headache and long day. They probably notice that my son was acting up a little but still  listening and telling the lady's that he wanted  chocolate milk and an orange with his meal. When it was time to pay they told me it was on the house... $14.30 may have not been much but really made my day and want to do something nice for someone else.

Thank you chipotle and there staff <3</text>

I am what the couponing world would say a newbie. These little shopping trips are my  "me time" and its hard to enjoy when your constantly being looked at suspiciously and  followed. I shopped several times at this Walgreens but never felt comfortable. Its a bummer too because its the closest to my home.< /Review>

You spend about 45 to an Hour very understaffed. They will notify you that it is ready. Get here and then still have to wait for them to fill it. Poorly understaffed not there fault-blame Corporate Wallgreens and Manager / Pharmacist.<//review>

<Review>I'd say the staff are quite helpful and courteous. I've only had one pharmacy cashier be a bit curt to someone in front of me. I usually visit the pharmacy and flash my receipt to the checker in the front as I leave. I'm always greeted with a smile.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
The only pharmacy in town that could figure out how to run my insurance - I went to half a dozen locations, it was a nightmare because the medication was quite expensive. Special thank you to Marian T. She really went the extra mile, from finding my prescription plan and trying very hard to find any kind of way to help me. I'm very grateful, thank you.< /Review>

Normally I always listen to the ratings so I wasn’t expecting great service. I’ve had a lot of trouble getting my medications but the pharmacy staff have been wonderful at working with me through the difficulties getting things authorized by the insurance. I felt very cared about there and I noticed they do the same for many others. I feel like rather than telling me there was nothing they could do and was not their problem (disconnected like so many are today), they actually took the time to call my doctor, talk to my insurance, and try to get everything all sorted out. Even if the rules were blocking me from getting me the medication I needed, they allowed me a few until everything got sorted through so I didn’t have to miss a dose. They are human and in a world full of beurocracy, this was a welcome surprise.<//review>

< Review>
I have been here multiple times, over several years. The store is as expected. However, when it comes to the pharmacy it seems very few, including the pharmacist, know what they are doing, along with a very poor attitude. It seems they always have an excuse as to why they cannot fill a prescription, at best for hours at worst days. Typically, when you bring in a prescription, you need it then not days later.</Review>

The store is ok but my experience with the pharmacy is by far the worst. Poor customer service, long lines, staff is extremely unprofessional! The one on landless is so much better. The staff here definitely needs proper corporate training.< /Text>

Took 3 days to tell that we can not provide specific compounding oinment. We submitted our prescription on 6th June and doctor said that it will be ready by tomorrow. When we called next day on June 7th, they said our computers are not working, we will contact you. On June 8th we got a call to tell that we dont provide this oinment. Wow !!< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Got a text about  11:00 saying RX was ready .About 5pm I went to pickup antibiotics for my granddaughter who had been discharged just that morning from emergency room.Many customers ahead of me and  after waiting in line for 15 -20 min. I was told by a pharmacist assistant that Doctor had made a mistake on RX and she needed to call him. I told her we needed the RX filled because Granddaughter  was in pain and she stated that she couldn't be in pain because she had been given pain meds that morning. (Implying that Granddaughter should be popping pain pills)
We asked for RX back so we could go elsewhere which is when she realized that
Doctor had faxed over a revised RX but that one had been filed away without being filled.
After waiting another 10 min I was given the the pills but not before being told that if that ever happened again I would have to wait the usual waiting time (which could be hours.) Seems mistakes happen often at this pharmacy!
I told her this was their mistake not mine and she proceeded to tell me to next time go to another store.
Mind you not once did she ever make eye contact with me . The whole time she proceeded to talk at me not with me.
She was not only unprofessional and rude but you could tell she was frazzled
by how busy it gets.
She definitely needs to get another job where she has no customer contact because after reading the other reviews I can see this behavior is being tolerated by the store.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The service is ran by hurrying children and refills placed in the morning still consistently take 30 mins after you get there and check in. That's if YOU realize the time. They don't say nothing,  even when they say they will.
All this has happened over and over.
As I'm texting this another lady is complaining about the same thing and that it happens all the time. I found a CVS right around the corner (or many in the area)< /Review>

Would have been better if the bartenders showed some sorta acknowledge when you walk up to the bar. Instead of walking back and forth taking care of what looked like regulars/favorites. A simple I will be with you in a few minutes when we walked up to the bar would have changed our whole night.< /text>

Is it kind of a dive? Yes. Is it my favorite place to go if I want to have a few suds and make a friend? Also yes. Though I avoid the weekend crowds after 10:30.</review>

I was twice falsely convicted in Merced County.  The Merced Sheriff’s department kidnapped me, had me beaten, and extorted money from my family.  Todd Mclean, Travis Colby, and Judge Harry Jacobs, made up their own rules in order to excessively order psychological evaluations and lie about the results.  I was forced into a plea for crimes I did not commit and then they made illegal terms and conditions of probation in order to send me to prison.  I confronted Todd about this only to have his girlfriend Stephanie Jamieson stalk and intimidate me.  Then, Cherie Mendenhall, Laura Parmenter, and Robin Baptista made up some part of their testimony in order to have me falsely convicted on a threat to blow up the Merced Court house in order to imprison me.  Vincent Andrade is the lead public defender.
Recall Warnke!
The Sheriff purposely allowed 6 criminals, some of them murders to escape in order to create a rouse in order to fund money for a new jail.< /review>

<user_name>Ciara John<//user_name><text>I used to really love the environment here, however things are not what they used to be. The environment is very judgmental and not what a church should be at all. I am sad to say this as many friends and family attend this church, but I will not be going back. While I am sure this is not what the entirety of the church represents,  a few employees are judgmental, hypocritical, and act as though only the most pure souls should be there. So sad.</text><time>1572633986164</time><UserId.>115504475426057713571<//UserId.><Rate>1<//Rate><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Great church. Very family friendly. If you like more of a family feel, this might be a good fit for you. Also, solid theology.</Review>

Gateway Community Church is a special family of believers comprised of many of my friends and dear siblings in Christ.  I can honestly encourage seekers and followers of Jesus to gather together her and call this family of believers THEIR VERY OWN family of believers.  The local church is a gift God gives each of us, and it's our opportunity to either accept this gift or reject it.  As a pastor of a very small church in Merced, I deeply appreciate knowing where I can point people looking for a larger church family and context to worship our Risen Lord, Jesus Christ.  Gateway is one of those families of believers I can encourage folks on toward seeking out and joining.  Al and I have build some friendship as well as Mark and several others.  Some of my closest friends including Charles P are also a part of this family.  May there be more and more unity among believers in Merced as we TOGETHER follow the Lord Jesus Christ in His mission to rescue sinners from themselves and draw them into His eternal embrace in the true and life-changing story of Jesus' death in our place!</review>

I first started coming to Gateway Community Church in March of 2013 when I started a work site at LifeLine CDC. I felt very comfortable and welcomed the first time that I came to Sunday service. Through the help of Pastor Al and my boss, Monika Grasley, I was baptized for my first time out at Yosemite Lake during Gateway's Lake service on September 8, 2013 and have enjoyed coming to service ever since.

Thank you to Gateway's Pastor, Staff, and the many volunteers!

My mom and I dread going to the AT&T store, it can be so confusing and we often feel like we’re trying to be sold things we don’t need. However, we lucked out today and met Luis who made the whole process quick and easy. He was knowledgeable and got us some great deals and an overall lower phone bill!! We appreciate Luis’ friendliness and professionalism and will be coming back!</text>

He showed excellent customer service 10/10 satisfied walking out the store. Sean answered all of my questions without any problems or required service; he knows what he’s doing. Juan was also working at the time, it appeared as if the other customers he was helping indeed had the same level of satisfaction and assistance. They both showed professionalism and patience I am grateful, will 100% recommend this place 5 stars!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1618591447882, 'text': 'Hello Jeremy Porter We sincerely appreciate you and all our customers!'}<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808435f65ca634a1:0xd804a5b576457b6e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very helpful and knowledgeable staff that excels at customer service and resourcefulness. Greeted me as soon as I walked in and were very helpful in explaining in detail what my current plan offered and what their newer plans consists of. Highly recommend this store to anyone looking to either switch or upgrade their current provider/service. 👌👍<//Text>

Our Sales Agent, Sean, was my favorite person today. I came with with my 75 year old father who’s never had a smart phone and was very nervous about the process, hence why he put it off for so long. Sean listened to his needs, was patient and helpful in explaining things, and even made the process fun and enjoyable. It meant so much to have him understand his perspective, and in turn see my father have this turn out to be a positive experience.< /text>

Great customer service. Went in for a new phone and walked out with not only a new IPhone but was able to trade in my old phone and got a crazy savings on the new one. Really impressed with the service we received today :)< /Review>

<Review>Thanks ATT Rohnert Park team for helping me with a complicated trade in issue. The manager Ivo was super patient and thorough  - I walked out with a new phone, fully backed up and no additional follow up. I’ll definitely come back here next time I need to purchase a new phone or accessories.< /Review>< Rating>

I would like to express my opinion for Silas a young man that assisted me with professionalism as a employee at the ATT store in Rohnert Park. I was looking for a phone and his knowledge was excellent as to answer all my questions. Silas was patient with explaining about the product and showing all the features that was available with the phone. I explained to him that I was looking for a phone and my decision in the future that I would be coming back  and asking for your sales person Silas to purchase a phone. Excellent and experience employee Silas.<//text>

I had the best service one could ever ask for!! I was greeted and explained the store’s policy and procedure due to COVID by Ernesto. The best thing was not only was Ernesto polite, professional, knowledgeable, and patient. Ernesto was assertive by being able to explain the importance of social distancing and limiting the number of customers in the store. I was seriously blown away to find out this young man is not a manager. If you guys want someone who can connect with the customers, sale merchandise and problem solve, then Ernesto should be a a manager. Just to tell you a little more my mom was in on Saturday and Ernesto told her to have me come in and he would assist me with phone upgrade. I got my new phone and I couldn’t be happy with the service I was provided.< /review>

My phone was stolen so I went to AT&T in Rohnert Park to get it shut down and find out if it was insured.

Ernesto helped me. He quickly verified the stolen phone was dead, and then looked to see if it was insured.

Yes!!! It was covered, though I had a deductable 🙁.

Ernesto called the insurance company and got my claim filed.

A new and better phone was on it's way to me in 1-2 dzys....sweet.

While he was doing all this, he was also correcting the dmage I did to my personal S10+, as well as answering all my questions 🙂

When the new phone arrived, I had a problem with the SIM. Iwent back to AT&T and IVO the manager helped me virtually as soon as I  stepped in the door.

So I had two phone problems taken care of, I was treated with respect and left very happy with the results.

Remember Covid-19  slows things down, it's not the stores fault and it is something we all must endure together. I will still suggest for your AT&T needs, visit the Rohnert Park store.<//text>

IVO deserves 1O or more stars as he is the most brilliant store manager who solved my phone challenge in a snap of a second.  You have no idea how fortunate you and your team are to have such a fine tuned, kind, compassionate manager.

With gratitude and a million thanks for the amazing IVO.   A very lucky customer.< /Review>

Picked up a sim card for my kids watch. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They were able to get me setup quickly. Only reason for the 4 star rating is they were a bit pushy on trying to get me to move the whole family over to them even after saying i was not interested. Overall a good experience though.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I went here for my wife. She was dealing with pain issues. I had never been to a dispensary before so this was my first experience.  Everyone was super friendly. The security guy at the door, the lady who took my information. All friendly!! Finally I talked with a wonderful young lady named Shanice.(hope I spelled it right). After giving her details about my wife she made great suggestions.  Shortly after getting home my wife was able to get comfortable.  I can't write how helpful these people were. It was a great experience!! Thank you!!</Text>< Pictures>

Ive only been a customer a few times but each time I have been treated with respect and courtesy... Always professional and knowledgeable! I was directed to a small array of products from which I found a great one. My daughter is a member a well... Her recommendation was spot on!<//Review>

<text>Not bad. Update: So I actually went inside this time, because I wanted to see for myself how the staff treated us. I updated to 5 stars. From start to finish all staff were very pleasant to deal with. The young lady with the braids (I didn't get her name) was awesome. She made a suggestion so we checked it out and bought some. It's called MAC (miracle alien cookies) and I posted a picture. It's amazing! She was very helpful and happily answered all my questions. Definitely recommend.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMJrQg29ftprpxc9ACQnVOz-47KXCtna1HvXPu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1598403336261, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving your review!

love this dispensary, it's cute, customer service is always great and the staff is knowledgeable & very well educated on product. Only thing I don't like is online ordering doesn't include taxes on weedmapa so it's always a little more on pick up, just a heads up. Worth the drive & I'll never go anywhere else 💕</text>

<review>I drove up from South Bay to pick up my order. After a 2.5 hour drive in holiday traffic, after calling to confirm my order I left my ID on my desk as I had to take a photo to process my online order. I forgot my ID, they wouldn't talk to me about options, and after trying to speak with a manager no call back no effort at all for a customer who just drove hours to spend hundreds of dollars. I had the scan of my ID and rest of my wallet. I get that you need an ID- that’s not the negative review. The review is for the total lack of giving 1 iota of care for one of your patients.

I was upset by the fact I forgot my ID,  but I have ADHD and forgetting is part of the condition. I’m used to that. It’s also an ADA disability FYI - what I’m not used to no - is zero effort to talk to a customer who went out of their way to visit your collective. I was given a sorry our policy is you need an ID and then looking to the next customer with a fake “sorry” as I friend to explain I called and drove 2.5 hours.  I couldn’t even talk to a manager after calling and requesting to speak with or receive a call back to see if they would hold my order until the next day.

Hold it forever for all I care  I will never again visit such a rude place whit no compassion or care. It’s truly a joke you call yourselves a “wellness”  Get real. YOU ARE A PROFIT CENTER WHO CARES ZERO FOR PATIENTS. Find another place to shop people.< /review>< pictures>

We understand that it must have been incredibly frustrating to drive 2.5 hours to pick up an order.  By no means do we want you to feel though we do not care.  Unfortunately, we are held to different standards from the government regulatory system put in place.  We of course would have loved to help you but there is not much we can do if the member does not have their ID (especially if it is their first time with our store).   I will be talking with our staff about approaching the situation with more compassion and understanding for someone who is going through a tough situation and needs their cannabis.\n\nThank you for your review and we will improve with our compassion for a customer that was in a situation like yourself.\n\nHave a great day.\n\nDWC'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x8085250b36e4a1b7:0x6f98083368ef939d</Gmap_id></record>

Been here a few times and I have to say they are nice, friendly, knowledgeable, and awesome people. I do sadly have to agree that the pricing is a bit steep, but it's some top quality product, so worth the price and worth the 5 stars.

Also they don't mention this on their website, but you MUST have a medical card to buy over an ounce! Caught me off guard the first time but been fine since.< /text>

This is place has great medicine..But when I order online the product says $60. Before tax.i get there to pick up meds and it's $67. Before tax. I talk to staff about this price change. I was told it's a tax thats already included before city and state tax.my receipt doesn't state this tax. They are a ripoff..Scheming customers out of money with this hidden fee on top of taxes...i wouldn't recommend this place based on bad business practice...<//Review>

< review>
I'm from Vacaville and have been in numerous times. Cute, quaint little place with friendly staff. Prices are a little steep and there's no sense of urgency so be prepared to wait. Even when I have called orders in or placed them online I have had to wait. They will not fill a pre-placed order 2 minutes after they close, even if you were just evacuated from your home due to wildfire.< /review>

I'm reading these 5 star reviews that talk about customer service, and I'm puzzled. Great customer service was not the experience from the young lady who helped my husband and I. I don't know the name of the young lady, but she but  has long hair and bangs. Looks to be of Asian ethnicity. she was rude and had major attitude and was extremely passive aggressive and sarcastic. Literally every interaction from giving her our identification, to handing us the form, to returning the form, to letting us through the door was awful. I cant even optimistically hope she misunderstood something I said because it started at first contact before I said anything. I know that customer service at this place is of low priority because people are going to come for their purchases anyway,  but to have chosen this place out of others was a mistake. With all the attitude enhancing products at her disposal, it's a wonder why she isn't nicer. At the very least, her bipolar medication should be taken before her shifts.</text>

Always knowledgeable staff. Reasonable prices. Stock depletes fast though so you can't depend on them having your same supply each time you go. Friendly service.</text>

Moved here 2 months ago and this is my one stop shop, great flower and awesome prices,  the city tax is a little much but good service is not cheap and that's what I get here great service and friendly environment, thanks again to everyone here! :).....p.s. they have plenty of different products to choose from all of them fire..........

Just got home and took The pic, this is one of the many promos they have in store, I follow them on Instagram and they let you know what's going on and the promo they have, which is great because you get cool deals like the pic,< /Text>

The wait has gotten pretty long but they seemed to be adding staff to compensate.  Changed the review mainly over the actual costs being decently larger than advertised on menu.  35 bucks is charged at 39 bucks THEN they add all the taxes.<//Review><GmapID>0x8085250b36e4a1b7:0x6f98083368ef939d<//GmapID>< Date>

Got served by Jeff, he was knowledgeable, patient and polite.  I explained that I was new to the scene and what I was looking for as far as pain and anxiety relief and he helped me choose what products to try.  I ultimately decided on some CBD drops and a vaping set up.  I really appreciate all of the help.</review>

You may have been to a dispensary before, but never to "THE" dispensary!!! Knowledgeable staff, they will discuss what works best for you and they have a huge variety to choose from. There is no going wrong giving this place a look if you haven't been before. Just voted BEST in Northern California!!!</Review>

Just bought an 1/8th from here.. it’s not sealed.. and no ones called me back for almost an hour now.. 😑 second time I’ve bought from them, second time I’ve had an issue..  We have a pandemic going on and who knows what wondering fingers have been in this jar. I don’t know your employees. I didn’t even want to come here but I’m legally blind and it’s close enough for me to access. I’m grossed out and so disappointed 🤮</text>

I came prepared with a lot of questions as I was sort of new to the "Cannabis world" and they answered all of my questions clearly and they were extremely helpful!

I didn't know the difference between CBD and THC and I wanted to try both and they recommended me Pete's brand and it was great. They gave me exactly what I wanted and this is definitely going to be my go-to place in the future. Great staff, very friendly. If you are looking for a good place to go and you are new to trying cannabis I would highly recommend this place!

Thanks Dixon Wellness!

I was staying in Vacaville at my in-laws and needed to re-up, I live in San Francisco. I googled dispensary's in the area and this had the best review. I'm glad I tried it. This club made me feel like I was at home in sf. Besides the Dixon city tax, which you can't blame the club for I was pleasantly surprised by the prices and helpful staff. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area and forgot to bring my stash.< /review>

Throughout the store and our menu we post stating that the prices do not include the taxes.  We understand that this amount can be shocking but we want our customers to know what is being charged by the government entities and what is being charged by our store.  We are working with our local municipality to hopefully get our taxes lowered from the current extra 10% charge that is on every cannabis item.

<Review>The place is nice, and so is the staff. I'm just confused as to why there was an additional sticker on the pre rolls... Its kind of sketchy, in my opinion. I bought a kiskanu green crack pre roll, and there was an additional sticker on the label, covering up the cbd% and thc%. The label and the sticker that was placed over it, had different values than the label that was already on the packaging. The label had higher levels, and the sticker they placed over it had lower. I have never seen this on prepackaged cannabis.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLMsfXmwEa_LcfQcrbXroQKoLM9sn69JBN685z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>{'time': 1545079234072, 'text': 'Hello Erica!  Thank you for your review and letting us explain.  California cannabis regulation has had many changes and challenges over the past year.  Each time a new phase of the regulations were rolled out many distributors and manufactures had to change their products to be complaint.  One of these items was how the product is tested and it had to be tested from a state approved and licensed lab.  Many companies had to send out the product the be retested in order to have complaint testing results.  This company had testing that came back lower than what their original testing showed and so they had to relabel the item.\n\nWe hope that this answers your question and that having the item relabeled is a good option for the consumer.  This testing was more accurate than the previous testing and was complaint with the current regulation.\n\nThank you,\nDWC'}</Response>< GmapID>

This is by far the nicest shop for a 75 mile radius. Everyone is super nice. The bud tenders are very knowledgeable. It’s a really nice shop where you feel like you’re all friends just hanging out. I highly 😁 recommend this shop. It’s also very clean and organized.< /Review>

<Text>This dispensary opening up in Dixon is awesome.. This is the only place I go to now...Davis is priced way to high. Fortunately I have never had anything disappointing from here! Everything has been great. It doesn't matter what u get, Everything will give you that experience your after. Having been a long time medical patient of cannabis I definitely recommend this place.< /Text>< GmapID>

Very small place but it has quite a variety of products. Loved the smokies. They are gummies and taste just like normal candy ❤️</text>

My absolute favorite dispensary in the area. I actually go out of my way to come here. The staff all around is an overwhelming joy. No matter who is working, they are so friendly and welcoming. I've been going there since they opened, and they have grown so much,and just continue to get better and better (even though they are already fantastic). I bring friends here for the first time and they always love it as well. Well worth the visit every time! Thank you for being so wonderful!<//text>

Very knowledgeable and friendly employees. The place is in a good neighborhood, it's clean inside. The prices are about the same as other cannabis stores. They only accept cash and they only let a few customers in the actual selling room, but its all good.< /Review>

<review>Prices inaccurate. Quoted $33 raw garden and $25 dime bag concentrate to have rang up as $36.84 and $27.99 on top of the $4.77 and $6.46 taxes. I’d keep driving to a store that actually has the prices correct.

Apparently the owners can’t read what I posted. I already addressed that the prices came from the items you were selling out of your booklet. Please go to where you have guests pick the products and you will see that you are quoting $33 not 36.84 before tax for raw garden. I also did ask your so called bud tender about my prices and he told me that it was $33 and $25. Which I will post the picture showing this is false.</review>< Pictures>

The employees here have been nothing but super kind and helpful. Very professional. They will listen to exactly what you’re asking for and make recommendations if you’re unsure of anything. I’m new to this so I had a lot of questions and uncertainties that they were more than happy to clear up for me. You guys are awesome. The shop is also very well maintained and clean!<//Text>

<review>Staff is cool, but i found actual garbage in one of the pre rolls from "the weed brand". Here's another kicker. Two different strains of pre roll. But it's the same stuff. Neither company would admit that they are at fault. No longer getting anything from either company anymore.<//review>< Response>

I've been here a couple of times now and I buy the same product every time, I usually get the Smokiez edibles sour apple gummies and I take them to help me with crushing panic disorder. Usually I take 1 gummy, and within 30-45 minutes I start to feel it in my system with the maximum effect hitting me in about 2 hours (as suggested on the package) and I'm usually very satisfied with how I feel after 1 dose. The last time I went here, a few days ago, they were out of the sour apple so I bought the regular apple. I've been taking them over the last few days and I have not felt like anything is happening at all. I called the store a few minutes ago and spoke to the manager, he kept insisting I try without eating beforehand, eating beforehand, try multiples of them at one time and says my tolerance may be going up, I repeatedly told him I've tried everything he is suggesting and I doubt that my tolerance is going up as I haven't been taking them for very long, maybe a few weeks to a month. But instead of offering a solution, we just kept going around and around him telling me to try different things and me saying I've already tried them and it's not helping me. He told me he hasn't had anyone else call about problems with the Smokiez edibles so I just have to keep trying what he suggested and hope it works out. I don't care if no one else has called about problems with a dud package, I JUST DID and my concerns were ignored. Another dispensary I've been to has flat out told me "If for any reason you aren't completely satisfied with your purchase, call us or come in and we will replace the product for you", yet I was not offered this at Dixon Wellness Collective. Very disappointing that instead of just offering to replace the product I purchased, I feel like I was being told it is MY fault the product I bought from them isn't working. I'm very disappointed and having worked in retail I can 100% tell you, if you offer to replace a product your customer says isnt working, it let's your customer know you're really listening to them and their concerns and letting them know that you take it seriously and want to bring them the best product possible, I feel like I was completely ignored by who I spoke to.
EDIT: I was looking at other reviews and I can see other customers notifying the store about problems with their product and the store offering to replace it for them. Now I'm more upset that I feel ignored and not taken seriously.<//Text>

They were so kind and helpful, and didn't mind walking me through all the tiny baby step questions and teaching me about how CBD is different from THC (like I said, I know nothing lol). Very glad this was my first experience, I really hope this balm helps with my rheumatoid arthritis since modern medicine has failed me. Excellent service, I plan to return for future needs.</review>< rating>

The staff is friendly. I told the woman serving me that although I liked CBD or a balanced tincture, I did not want to get high.  I was looking for CBD for my arthritis. She offered a 1/1 CBD/THC tincture which I liked. When asked if there was anything else I wanted,  I bought two bags of cookies.  When I got home I realized that although I told the staff person that I did not want to  get high- both bags of cookies were only THC!  I tried one cookie and used 15 drops of a CBD only tincture I had on hand and had COUCH LOCK.  I called the Dixon Dispensary to return the unopened bag of cookies. (“Big Pete’s” brand). They said no and offered to sell me CBD only cookies which I assumed was what I had originally bought.  Be careful if you shop at this dispensary.  Don’t rely on the staff to listen very closely to what you are looking for.  (They do have signs saying no returns, and now I know why.)</Review>

< review>
Out of towners beware, they will lie to you. I called ahead of time to make sure they had the correct item and got confirmation that they did. Drove for an hour only to be given the wrong item being told it would work. Guess what? It didnt work. In fact the "manager" on duty said they didnt even carry what I wanted. Drove another hour to get my money back. When I got there I offered a solution where I wouldn't leave empty handed and the location still got their sale. The "manager" on duty refused and didnt even try to make it right. Completely disappointed and still left empty handed. Will not be returning and I highly suggest nobody else does.</review>

<review>Been working out here since they opened. I like the assortment of potential workouts that can be done. Would like a little more options for calisthenics, but besides that it's pretty much perfect. It's a good day when I'm able to use the massage chair.<//review><name>Jacki Moya<//name>< rating>

<review>I have come here for over a year now after leaving 24 hour fitness.
I have had great results since joining. The team here is very polite and demonstrates excellent fitness knowledge. Matt, Hailey David and Alyssa's team are top notch. I also highly recommend this gym if you are also seriously interested in getting involved with MMA. Coach Anthony Renteria  private coaching and conditioning classes is top notch that bring elite results.<//review>< date>

<Text>Best gym I’ve enrolled in. Staff and coaches are very approachable and non-judgmental. Their Brazilian Jiu Jitsu program has been the difference maker in maintaining a healthy lifestyle for me. Before joining this gym I knew nothing nor had any interest in anything mma related. They really make you feel like family here.< /Text>< Pics>

I cancelled my wife and my memberships in writing in person in July of 2020.  UFC started doing unauthorized debits from our bank account April 2nd this year.  I immediately called and spoke to manager Matt who promised to fix it and issue a credit.

Our account was debited again April 29th and May 2nd.  I called again today and spoke to manager Chris. He's looking into it.

Funny how fast a company can take you to collections for non-payment and have no trouble automatically taking money from a former member to bolster their ailing cashflow.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dd2b661344a20b:0x8e159f5de53b8e66</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Coach Crill went out of his way to offer me this complimentary session, because he wished to correct some errors in my posture while I was lifting on my own. While I still need some time to decide whether to purchase more trainer sessions with him, coach Crill was polite and understanding, never pushy. I highly recommend Jeremy Crill if you're thinking about getting personal trainer sessions--he's the best trainer I've had at fitness SF.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Staff is always friendly and ready to help. Very spacious and not as crowded as other gyms I go to (24hr fitness / Crunch). Relatively speaking, everything is kept nice and clean which is definitely a plus for me. Don was the one that helped me get my membership here and I was very pleased with his service.</Review>

If you sell a service you should probably highlight where it says they expire and also make it clear that if certain time goes but you have to buy more for them to grant you the ones you already bought and paid for. Management sucks, you reach corporate and they don’t even have the decency to get back to you! But i will get and call where I have to, to get this straight, not just because I pod my money for those sessions but because they need to straight out when they sell the products. As consumers we also have rights and should have better customer service< /Review></record>

<Review>UFC Gym LM is so unique. It offers classes that other gyms do not. Wrestling, Jiu Jitsu. Boxing all combat sports for the entire family, even women and children should know this life skill of self defense. This gym is a lifestyle! Has something for everyone, if you are a single lady looking for a date. This would be the spot. Something for everyone!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Beware. The facility is great, the program is great, and I met great trainers and good staffs here. However, there are salespeople in the house that will ruin every single good part of this gym experience. They will roam around you to prey on you to sign up for additional membership, personal training, etc. It's a constant pressure. I had an experience with General Manager who is a salesperson here (I won't name who). He was acting  nice and genuine at first. And he constantly pushes his limit to increase his monthly sales report. The general manager in this gym overlapped my pre-existing membership and reduced 1 month of membership without telling.  I asked him to please fix this issue and he said he will do so continuously and pushed back and never did for months. Also promised that he will do full refund of 3 year membership because I may have the chance of moving away, and when moving-out actually happened, they charged me $250 for cancelling the membership. The sales people here are liars and con artists. Horrible customer service. Trust me, I met great trainers who are genuinely nice people, and it has a great facility, but some con artists salespeople who have no integrity ruins the entire experience. Stay away!< /review>

The manager here James white is a scam artist at large here BEWARE!! They overlapped my membership and they were double dipping on my cc. I told James white about the issue and he bold faced lied to me saying they were going to fix the issue and refund my money.  That never happened. This had been going on for 3 months. Finally after pestering James white about what he was doing he handed the account off to another member of management . He took care of it and we finally got out money back after 4 months. Now this upset James white and he had it out for me once he found out he made a mistake and could not own up to it. Today they dipped into my account again without authorization and tried to get a so called "cleaning fee" which was 40 dollars. I approached James about it and he could not be professional and cried like a child and had my account cancelled because he was tired of hearing me telling him about dipping into my account without authorization. A cleaning fee? Unheard of and isn't that what the member ship fee pays for. For the cleaning people . Come on James white get it together you shady character. Every member now I advise you to keep an eye on your accounts because you make have been having unknown hidden charges.</text>

The gym is nice, it's spacious, and there are plenty of machines. Even at 5 PM after work, there's still enough machines or enough space in the free weight area to work out. However, the management is money hungry. They make it extremely difficult to cancel your personal training or gym membership (I bought a package so it was my sister and her friends who had this problem). For me, I bought a 3 year membership because I was guaranteed that I would get a refund if I move away and could not transfer my membership to another gym. It has been over 3 months with over 30 calls speaking to "managers" assuring me I would get my money back and they would contact me. I've been ghosted by the guy in charge of refunds for 3 months now. Finally talked to the manager of the whole gym but now I'll just have to visit in person weekly until I get my money back.</Text>

<Text>Cancelling membership is a nightmare. I cancelled mine on may 27 and was told that I won't be charged anymore after that and I can use the gym til July because of the last month which they charged upon signing up. Then I got charged Jun 23 the membership fee. I got a hold of the Jueun who "takes care" of my account and he emailed Chris who to check into it. Chris never got back to us. The next week Jun 30 I got charged again 49 for the yearly thing. At this point I went to the club showed them the proof of cancellation but alas Chris is nowhere to be found. I left a message with the girl on the front desk who said that she will personally give it to Jueun and to Chris. Now it's July 6 and I still haven't heard from anyone. My money hasn't been refunded yet and I bet my account is still active. I did all the right steps. I cancelled way ahead of time in person. I can't keep driving back to the club just to check. No one is helping! It's a nightmare.</Text>< gmapID>

Horrible customer service - My CC was compromised with clear evidence that it occurred at this location. They have yet to refund my $165 and it has been 2 months - Be careful providing any information to this gym .... Who knows what security measures are in place to protect your information. I'm very displeased with their customer service!!!<//text>

<Review>The staff at the front desk is very friendly and helpful , but the training management is terrible. All they want is your money and what is beneficial to them. You'll pay a ton of money, expecting to get all they sell you, but instead you get the bare minimum.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I'm in the process of cancelling the 2 memberships under my name.  Administratively I've requested to speak to managers on multiple occasions, left messages, etc.  No response.  I left the country and placed 2 accounts on hold.  I came back and they still charged me.  Unsatisfactory for the money I pay.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Horrible prices.. Just get a fitness gym nearby or try going to a nearby Martial Artist for a cheaper price if you want to learn martial Arts. Don't come here for martial arts because it's mostly a gym not a MMA center. Owner is rude and unemphatic. Save yourself some time, money and effort by going to another gym instead with so much less. They charge you really high prices and the services they provide doesn't justify for it.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd2b661344a20b:0x8e159f5de53b8e66</Gmap_id><review>Great gym(equipment wise) but they charged me twice the amount I was paying for one month after I froze my account which was very irritating. They keep pestering me about personal training sessions and I finally agreed to do one free session which was included in my membership because thye were starting to annoy me with their relentless calls and texts. I came in thinking it would be a workout but it ended up being them interviewing me and giving me a tour of the gym even though I made it clear I'd been there for a year already. An hour and a half later I was still there and they were in the process of signing me up to start personal training after which I declined. What a waste of two hours that was. They didn't communicate clearly what they wanted to use this "free training session" for. I came in thinking it was a workout but instead it was them just trying to sign me up. Additionally, I've known many who have had two accounts opened under their name, charging them double of what was supposed to be charged. Very sketchy and unethical stuff going on at this gym.< /review></record>

<Text>I think this has been the best gym experience i have ever had, i have had many gym memberships in the past but this one is unique. First of all it's spacious and the equipment is state of the art and well maintained, with one request if management would assign someone to do restroom checks every 2 hours it would be greatly appreciated, the young lady that usually cleans them does an amazing job, but she is not working all day and i have noticed in the daytime hours they need to be maintained. That being said the staff are excellent, that place is busy and the staff are about their bussiness as they should be, but there is one gentleman that stands out to me his name is Phillip he changes the whole atmosphere. As i said earlier it can be busy but he brings something very special to this experience, he has the perfect balance between professionalism and knowing how to be personable, which is not always easy i don't know him well, but he always makes that extra effort to make me feel welcomed, and is so aware of what is going on in that gym. If i have ever had an issue that needed to be dealt with regarding gym membership dues, joining a challenge, or just updating my UFC phone application, he is the man that  notices i need assistance before I even ask he is so perceptive, he always makes me feel like he has my best interest in mind and i feel completely confident in his direction. He goes out of his way to say hello or offer assistance and is always looking for an opportunity to deal with problems that arise you just don't get that anywhere so keep up the outstanding work!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Very Bad Experience.  My son bought a membership. Decided the next day he did not want the membership.  I called and spoke to sales manager Jeremy and he assured me he would refund my sons membership.  My son went to see Jeremy on the 3rd day to cancel and Jeremy told him to not cancel and to think about it for several more days.  Every time my son texted him or showed up Jeremy was not there and the cancelation needed to be done by Jeremy.   He did not help my son for 2 weeks.  Finally filled out paperwork with him.  My son never saw a refund.  Jeremy will not return my sons calls.  I called corporate today and they stated my son needed to cancel within 5 days or no refund.  This is a very dishonest sales organization.  They support their sales people playing games to enforce the contracts.  Thankfully my son has all the conversations on text.  See you in court UFC.....<//Text>

Cant even enjoy the ufc events. While listening to the event the staff gets on the PA System to make a call. Even before the end of the event the staff immediately get on the PA forcing everybody to pick up the chairs. Holy cow someone is impatient. A lot of people were complaining.

Stop pushing people about training sessions. I stress so much because im being pushed on getting a personal trainer. ITS EXPENSIVE AND MORE THAN WHAT I PAY AND I DONT WANT IT!!!!

Its coming to the point of cancelling my membership. I wanted to enjoy a huge gym yet only to be pushed around to pay something I dont want.</review>

<review>Not impressed and wont be going back. Spoke to a salesman named rickey I believe. He was very pushy and didn't seem knowledgeable at all about mma. The gym is kinda nice but filled with ego bloated steroid using "tough"guys... and the instructors there for such arts as Brazilian Jiu-jitsu are kinda of a joke. There are much better and cheaper places right around the corner. Just sayin.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Didn't even know they existed until very recently when scrolling through Door Dash.  Ordered dinner to be delivered and it was SO GOOD.  The lasagna was delicious and the bread they included was amazing.  Will definitely order from them again.<//review>

It is a very nice place and the food very good and the staff very friendly I recommend them to go with family or friends I have even because you do your order of food or pizza online or on the phone have delivery at home and take it to you on time and the food always arrives hot thanks friends for their great work in these bad times that we are going through< /review>

Amazing. After almost 2 weeks of eating not very well in Cali, we found this place. The service was impeccable, the food cooked to perfection. My wife had chicken with veg, my son had a well done steak and veg and I had a rare steak with veg. All 3 were cooked perfectly.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><text>First time trying this place and must say I’m very impressed!  Service was exceptional and food was phenomenal.  They have an extensive Italian menu selection along with made to order pizza.

The penne pasta in spice cream sauce with shrimp was excellent!  Nice wine selections too!

Although tucked in a shopping center doesn’t seem ideal but you won’t be disappointed coming here!

Definitely recommend!!!</text>< pics>

<Text>Truly exceptional every time. I had the homemade lobster raviolis w tiger prawns in a sauce I'll describe as liquid gold. The bread, salad and wine list are amazing too!< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Much more than a “pizza” restaurant...best described as an “Italian” restaurant.  Lovely white table cloth dining.  Excellent service.  Entrees top out at about $25, but pizza and calzone can be had for as little as $15.  Good selection of wines.  Walking distance from the Marriott!<//Review>

This restaurant in Spumoni Pizza One is a good place to get a quick bite btwn flights
I had the BBQ chicken chopped salad, it was a nice portion and had lots of fresh lettuce jicama, corn,black beans and corn chips. It was a bit light on the BBQ chicken seems they could add a bit more chicken for the price. The salad was tossed w dressing and not too much which was good. The service was super fast--seriously less than 5 mins for my salad to come out. The pizzas looked really tasty many were eating them also.< /text>

I had the pesto chicken sandwich and my girlfriend had the Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken on their lunch menu and they were fantastic. finally finished off with some spumoni ice cream, our new favorite. The service was spectacular and the ambiance was on point. Will definitely make this our regular spot👍🏾.</Text>

<username>SirPugslyYT</username><Review>Ordered the gnocchi alfredo with chicken, the gnocchi was soft like pillows and melted in your mouth, I will order again.  My mom ordered their special salmon on a bed of spinach and red peppers in a light lemon cream sauce, broccoli and carrots, and a light lemon pasta, and a caesar salad. Add that to their homemade bread and olive oil, you get alot for a great price. Did I mention, everything is homemade from scratch. Food was so good. Service was great. They kept the place clean, and customers spaced to keep with the covid guidelines. I will definitely be back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

< Review>
First off I would like to say that I have heard nothing but great reviews from friends of mine, I don’t know if I just had a bad experience but I am very disappointed. My meal was ok, I’m vegan and it’s a bit difficult to find dishes at most places but my food was ok. My mother who lived in Italy for years got Gnocchi. We grubhubbed it because our cars are in the shop. Her gnocchi looked vile and she couldn’t even finish it. It was super undercooked and had the consistency of melted cheese. It was like dough and her garlic bread was stale. The gnocchi even caused her stomach to ache. I hesitated to write this review because all our friends talk about how great the gnocchi and garlic bread is, but our experience truly was disappointing.< /Review>

Something changed.. my wife and I have been ordering from here for years. Everything we ordered tonight was completely bland. From the Fettuccine Alfredo, Capellini Alla Checca, and the garlic bread. Every pasta dish had more pasta than usual but was met with a void of flavor. The garlic bread has changed from little rounds of bread to pizza dough cut in half with olive oil and some garlic sprinkles. I hope this was a bad night versus a change of ingredients for the menu. Don't want to lose another Italian option in NP.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>THIS IS A VERY NICE COZY ITALIAN RESTAURANT. NOT A PIZZA JOINT. THE VEAL OSSO BUCO WAS THE BEST THING I HAVE EATEN IN 20 YEARS. THEIR CHICKEN MARSALA ALSO EXCELLENT. THE ONLY VERY MINOR CRITICISM WOULD BE THE SALAD DRESSING. ADD SOME OLIVE OIL AND BALSAMIC.   THE TAPENADE WAS INDULGENT.  SO FAR THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN THE AREA.< /Text>< Pictures>

Honestly the food wasn’t great I had the risotto and it wasn’t cooked all the way. It also was like slop and the portion was so big. My friend had
Fettuccine Gamberi Porcini e Carciof it was distasteful. The service was not good, it felt like we were a bother I think it was the manager who helped he didn’t even give us the whole specials menu and was rushing our service and there wasn’t other people he had to help. The service and the food were just bad. Don’t recommend going to this place you pay as much as other much better restaurants.</text>

Great place..........you look on line at their own website and then call in an order and the manager wants to argue with you about the prices saying that the web page is wrong not by a bit but a lot! Never mind the customer who just wants to eat there. I would never give them my business because of the attitude of the manager / owner. Sad.<//Review>

The theater is clean but the staff is usually a little grumpy. Due to COVID the concessions are very limited to nachos no jalapeños, butter popcorn and hot dogs. The drinks are even limited so if you want the full experience wait until after the COVID restrictions.< /text>

My mom & I decided to purchase our movie tickets 7 hours early, just to get good seats & it worked. We visited the concession stands to purchase our tickets. Breanne, employee, told us that you must reserve your seats & that people must be spread out in the theatre. My mom & I came back at 7pm to purchase our popcorn & drinks. I want to thank the employee, Sarah, for helping us save money on popcorn & drinks by explaining their good deals!!! The movie that we went to see was the 7:30 showing of "Nobody". When entering Theatre #12, there was two other people sitting in their seats. I was in shock of how the seats were & how much space in between the aisles. The seats are labeled in ABC order. So, my seats were G - 10 & G - 9. Our seats were 2 rows from the back wall of the theatre right in the middle. We sat down in our seats & they were so comfortable. They were recliner seats, so you can position the level of your legs and position your head too. There is a small desk that holds your drink and your snacks. A couple came and sat anywhere for a bit of time. Another couple came into the same row that the other couple was sitting in & told them that they were in their seats. The couple that sat in the wrong seats came sitting next to us. Another couple that came at a later time sat next to us also in the same row. They left one space between us. My mom was a bit confused on how come they're allowing reserved seating when people aren't sitting in the seats that they paid for? Ushers should come in and check customers' movie tickets before the movie starts to make sure they're in the correct seats.
Other than that, the movie was really really good. I reccomend watching it. Such a long review, but I just want people to know my full experience :)< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>Very comfortable reclining seating and viewing experience, Grade A popcorn (I'm looking at you AMC), the free refills on large food items is an often overlooked bonus. The pricing of the food is a bit ridiculous, but I think that's just what you get at theaters these days. Overall, better than AMC.</review>< response>

Super thankful they're open and showing good movies, but tonight it was too warm in theater. No AC... due to cutbacks? Or maybe couldn't afford the bill? We dressed for a cold theater, so it was a bit miserable.
Movie and popcorn were great!</review>

Their seats are super comfortable and recline. I would recommend going early for the best seats or reserving them before. I don't recommend the front row as it's too close and will hurt your neck. Also, it's right next to the mall which is perfect!< /Text>< pics>

This is the best of the regal theaters which says a lot about the chain. They are always understaffed and it can take 40+ minutes to get a food order. Guaranteed 20-30 for a simple popcorn and candy. Mind you, you're paying outrageous theater prices for the bad service. These times have gotten worse since they closed the box office and made you buy tickets at concessions. Location is great at the mall and the recliners are nice though. Just plan to be there extremely early or don't get concessions and buy tickets through the app.< /Text>

The hot dogs we ordered were not good. Staile bread and old,dry and cold winnies. The soda was flat and warm. Pizza was okay but I don't think it was cooked all the way. Besides that,  customer service was good and the theater was clean.< /Review>

As home theater equipment gets better and better, movie theaters are making the movie experience more home like with reclining chairs and menu items far beyond the popcorn and Coke of my youth. The Regal in Carlsbad does this as well as anyone in the area. The seats are comfortable and the snack bar is well stocked with a variety of junk food. To be sure, they have actual meals, but clearly on the junk food side - hey, it's a movie theater. Food is acceptable, but if you're coming to the Regal to eat, then you should be reading a review of mental hospitals and not movie theaters.</review>

No more refills on large popcorn or drinks. No signs that I saw mentioned this and the cashier didn't bother to tell me either. I wouldn't have gotten it had I known. Also, they switched to Pepsi. Yuck. Honestly, for my family, not much reason to go to the movies with these changes.</Text>

<review>My favorite.  First affordable reclining theater.  Am a member and earn free tickets, popcorn, soda, and reduced rate items too.  Bring a blanket and curl up.  Every holiday, I ask for gift cards for this place.  Surrounded by a wide variety of restaurants from high end to fast food, of which there's is fresh to go!< /review>< Pictures>

Big and open lobby.  Cool layout. Centrally located customer service area. Nicely decorated.  Comfortable seating.  Average friendly service, nothing special.
Example, if the projectors goes down you will be moved to another showing or get your money back. No coupons or extra reimbursements for the inconvenience.<//Text>

Order your tickets and pick your seats before coming.  This theater is at the mall so shows gets fill often.  They have very comfortable reclining leather seats, but you will be paying the premium for that comfort.<//text>

The seats are disgusting.  It's a fairly new theater but the inside really looks run down. Some of the recliner seats are even broken.<//text>

Probably the most incompetent personnel working. Went with family to by tickets, girl behind glass window rings me up, then hands my card back to me and says sorry it doesn’t work. Calls manager and he walks in the booth then walks out. After standing in line for 20 minutes! You have to be kidding me! I walk over and stood in line another 10 minutes to use the self serve kiosk. Kiosk worked just fine. Took my input, credit card, and money without a hitch. It was probably more personable than the person behind the glass. Only bummer now is the only seats available were so close to the screen, it’s blurry! Literally laying in your back to see anything. Sorry, but customer service is number 1 in my book and this place sucks! Not one interaction from the people that worked here except “sorry it doesn’t work”. At least the kiosk said thanks!<//text>

<Review>The mall location is convenient and the lobby and concession stand is clean and modern. However, this is supposed to be an upscale theatre with luxury recliner type theatre seating and the tickets are higher priced than a regular movie theatre so you would expect the theatre itself to be nice. The seats and side table tops were old, very worn and many had tears in the seats.

Not what we would consider justification for the higher priced tickets. Their theatre is definitely in need of a facelift.</Review>< Pictures>

This Regal Cinema is kept very clean, is ADA accessible and the leather seats recline.  I purchased my seat ticket using their app and when I arrived they scanned my ticket and my seat was waiting. It is so nice to be able to reserve your seat before getting to the theater.<//review>

Still a fairly good place for the movies and the recliners have been changed out, so you don't have worn leather or ones that crumble in you hair but the bathroom and concessions areas are still bad. Bathrooms are never clean and the concessions take forever. The lines aren't crazy long because please give up and leave. It's like they put the newbie trainees there to cashier. They all have "deer in the headlights" looks in their eyes and don't really know how to hustle.<//text>

Great place to see a movie. The seats are comfortable and have the ability to recline to your comfort. There is ample space in each aisle and between each seat to make sure you are always in comfort. The lower amount of seats in each theater help the environment from seeming too stuffy or crowded, even in a full house. Each seat has it's own tray so you have the perfect place to keep all of your movie snacks. And speaking of movie snacks, they have quite a few options to satisfy your hunger during your show. Prices are a little high for the tickets but food is reasonable for a movie theater.< /Review>

I had to contact lost and found at this dump... and I stress that.... very dirty.  After being transferred several times,  the last electronic transfer hung up on me.  No person to talk to... not even a message machine.  Tried several times over the next few days hoping it was a glitch and they would fix it, but no. I had to return in person.  Was told to wait at Guest Services, then waited 11 minutes. The lost item was not a big deal,  but I could use my two hours back.  Management here does not respect its customers.<//Review>

Brand-new seats in the auditoriums!  They are very well cushioned although a bit narrower than the previous ones.  The Regal 12 is now even .ore convenient than before, since now there are doors that lead directly between there and The Shoppes at Carlsbad.< /review>

It's an OK theater. Not very handicap accessible through. No nearby handicap parking, extremely long walks into the theater and down the long hall, We went through 7 headphone sets for the hard of hearing, trying to find even one that actually worked in theater 8. This caused me to walk back and forth from the customer service booth to one of the farthest theaters, completely missing the first part of the movie. Staff did not offer to come down and assist. I took 2 gentlemen in their upper 80s to see the Ford  verses Ferrari movie. We noticed that all of the handicap seating  was taken up with young people with small children and strollers, not appearing to  be disabled. This caused these gentlemen to struggle up the stairs to the lowest upper seats that were available, even though we purchased our tickets 4 days in advance. This is an ok theater to go if you are in good health with no disability, otherwise I would not recommend this theater for the elderly or disabled< /review>

Love the stadium seating. It’s Good to get your tickets early. Some theatre’s are smaller than others thus there are more seats closer to screen than higher up , unless your good with getting a sore neck.</text>

<review>Man so much to say about this movie theater. The employees are always there to welcome you with a smile and the managers are the exact same way if not better. Also they have recliner seats which is nice. Also located in a mall so it's much easier to do stuff</review><rate>5< /rate><UserId.>101944900082123277080</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

West Field Mall has been getting better. It started with Regal 12. What I like about the theater are the assigned seatings, full range recliners through out, wide isles between rows. I'm talking about even with recliners fully extended, people can still walk in the isle without bothering people sitting even a little bit.<//review>

Really nice theater. Reclining assigned seats, so I suggest picking them out online in advance. You can get the usual food, drink, booze, or snacks. Price wise... it's a movie theater, your gonna over pay for snacks always.</Review>

Ordered tickets online to avoid a wait. Lines for concession were long but moved quickly. Seats were very comfortable... Reclining seats with tray table and cup holder. Recommend getting snacks before going to theater. Parking can get challenging so go early. Staff was friendly and helpful. Nice theater. Bathrooms were very clean.<//review>

I’ve only had to purchase tickets in person here once, and it was a quick and easy process. The lobby is big and open. It doesn’t feel cluttered and overwhelming from so many displays and tables. I can’t say much about the staff because we’ve only had encounters with the younger staff, and I know in first jobs they’re so worried about doing everything correctly that they forget to smile. But no big, they’ve all been courteous and none have made us feel rushed. Love the small theaters, and the seats are so comfy! There are 2-3 rows at the very front and most of the theaters are about 3-4 more rows after that. There is plenty of walkway room, and the lights on the stairs make it easy to see where you’re going. Restrooms are clean and well kept. And there are enough stalls that I’ve never had to wait in line - before, during or after any movie I’ve watched here. Overall, I’d say this is one of my favorite places to relax every once in a while.<//Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This is such a nice theater. Stadium seating and recliners with foot rests. Bonus that there is tons of parking at the mall and nice restaurants nearby. Pro tip, use the kiosk for tickets instead of waiting in line. Movie pass can be used at the kiosk as well as gift cards and credit cards. Also, there is assigned seating which I always like so you can get your tickets early and not have to wait forever in the theater for a good spot< /review>< Pictures>

12-theaters. Front of the Carlsbad mall with Ample free parking. Fairly good refreshment service and selection, including beer for Adult customers. All theatres have reclining seats, very clean. Plenty of restaurants near-by and mall shopping. Vons shopping better and banking across the the street from the mall off El Camino Real.</Text>

Staff are cheerful and the place is spacious. The seats are by reservation and are the kind which recline and have a surface for your concessions.

Very cushy and comfy - I feel sometimes like I melt into their chairs.

My one complaint is that it's not easy to find the entrance. It's tucked close to the mall entrance with a small sign; there's a much larger sign visible from the street, but it'll lead you to the back of the building, and the only way around is by climbing over hedges or going through the whole mall.

Parking can be a bit tight if you go at peak hours due to sharing with the shops.</Review>

Seats are fine. I don't like the way they changed the lines for the concession stand. I like one single line. It seems to go quicker. Plus, I always go in the line that takes forever.  The woman's restroom down the hall near the theatres was closed down.</review>

This is our closest theater and is very reliable for being clean and friendly. Some of the big chairs are starting to show signs of serious wear, though. Today we saw Lego Movie 2 and the whole family had a great time. I appreciate that in this theater I never hear what's happening next door and the sound system is always on point.</Review>

Concession stand is horrible. We waited over 30 minutes for a drink. At first there was only two registers open at opposite ends of the counter and the lines kept getting longer. They than opened two more registers but all at the opposite end from our side. So you than had 3 registers for one line and 1 register for the other line. When people kept complaining because we were on the side with the one register, the manager just said sorry but didn’t try to fix it and every time someone in the line we were in tried to go to the other lane, they told them they couldn’t change. The managers didn’t care that the lines were angry and complaining. In fact I think they purposefully tried to ignore everyone and not make eye contact. One manager was a large man with a beard and the other was a small girl with blonde hair and glasses. Don’t ask either of these people for help because they won’t.< /review><response>{'time': 1556659812888, 'text': 'Carey  we strive to give you the best experience and would like the opportunity to give you a great experience, next time.

I went to watch a special screening of a movie tonight and the movie was great. The theater was not. The projector was not on for the first ten minutes of the film. Everyone was sitting in a dark theater only being able to hear the movie, not see it. Some people got up to tell the workers about it and finally the movie was projected on to the screen, but we had already missed out on the beginning and asked the projectionist, whose head stuck out the small window above the theater, if they could start the movie from the beginning. They looked around for a few seconds, then stuck they're head back in without saying a word and the movie continued like normal for a good couple of minutes until suddenly, without warning, it completely stopped. We then proceeded to wait another good couple of minutes staring at a blank screen until finally the movie began again, this time from the beginning. The whole thing took about half an hour. I don't like to complain, but through this whole ordeal NOBODY from the theater came in to tell us what was happening. They didn't explain or apologize for the lateness of the film and I just found that so odd and rude. I have had something similar happen to me at a different Regal location and the manager quickly came into the theater and explained what was happening and even offered to give us free vouchers for a future movie. At this theater though we were all left completely in the dark. I don't think I'll be coming back to this particular theater.< /text>

Nothing like Cinepolis that I'm used to but t times, it doesn't play all the movies. The place was clean and the staff was nice. Concessions representative asked for my regal information and ticket person did his part. The popcorn was made good with the right amount of butter. The stadium has reclining seats and surround sound for the movie was great. Also, outside the area was great.<//Review>

Many organizations sell discounted tickets so that will help with the rising cost of going to the movies. If you want to get a good seat, you need to reserve your seats sometimes days in advance!

<review>Wow, they did an excellent job at this one.  It's definitely my favorite Regal.  Lots of unique food options, super comfortable power reclining seats, convenient swivel tables for setting your snacks on, and stadium seating.  Good employees, and everything is always clean - no sticky floors, clean bathrooms (even the men's room!) and spotless lobby.  Excellent viewing experience.  Can't think of what I'd do to improve anything.</review>< pictures>

Conveniently located at the Westfield mall in Carlsbad.  You select assigned seats which is a major plus.   They have a decent selection of snacks and beer.  There is a long wait time for ordering food even if the line is small.  Also the head rests on most of the seats are worn down significantly.  They should consider redoing  them with more durable materials.<//Review>

I'd never been to this theater before. Seating was assigned, chairs were motorized recliners, and there were swivel trays for food and drink. Relatively clean and quiet. The quiet may or may not have been due to being there in early afternoon. I would definitely visit if in the area again.<//Review>

I really appreciate the leather chairs that are able to prop up your feet and lay your upper body back in the movie theater. It makes the movie experience that much more comfortable and enjoyable.  Sale of beer and wine can make the experience better (3 drink limit, but honestly the price is as cheap as going to a dive bar.  Say that in a good light).  Downside, it's can be an expensive movie ticket.<//review>

Only negative is you usually need to go several hours before your movie time and buy your tickets if you want a decent seat further back from the screen. Many times its sold out or only seats in the front couple rows are available and that's too close to the screen.<//Text>< gmapID>

We were denied entry into our movie, after we had waited in line to purchase tickets, waited in line to purchase snacks, waited in line to enter the movie. Reason being is understandable, our 5 month daughter is under age for a R movie, Equalizer 2. Getting to the point, after asking questions and getting rude, cold, unprofessional answers we were refunded everything. I guess my time is worth nothing to this manager who is representing Regal Theaters. This is the last time we will return here. As much money as this theater charges for extra amenities you would think that money would go to hiring professional managers. Person in question is in the attached photo. He didn't even have the balls to look at me and my family, when he said sorry, very quietly.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8ckEZDDF1Kowfy41GFExrypXspIYz_XeZT_-b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

Very clean. Comfy seats. Great experience overall. The seats are so great because they recline, my daughter (age2) fell asleep within 5 minutes of the movie and slept the whole way through. We had to wake her up because the movie was over.< /Text>

This is a very nice theater the seating is very comfortable.  The bathrooms are clean the staff is polite.
The price is reasonable considering the comfort of the seats.  The one negative is that you need to select your seating early as the front two rows are not the greatest for viewing. I have visited this theater on three occasions and would go again.  I think the experience in all is pretty good.<//text>

<review>If you order food that must be cooked (pizza, tenders, etc.), be SURE the counter help puts the order in to the kitchen way in the back! Tonight they did not so I missed the critical beginning of a movie cuz when I finally got someone to ck on it 15 min later. It was obvious that they had NOT started my order until I asked!!! They were however, kind enough to comp me a ticket when I let them know there was a big problem! They were apparently way too short staffed for the evening as I waited 10 more min to talk to Guest Services about my problems after the movie. Hope they get help soon & can be more customer conscious.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I’ve reviewed this place at a five star when it first opened but now it’s been here a couple years and the wear and tear in the center seats, the ones most used is getting really bad. The staff is still friendly, albeit a little slow when lines get long, seems more of an understaffing problem though. Those center seats really need replacing. I’ve sat in a few so worn that their uncomfortable against the skin and another one that the leg recliner mechanism was bent so when it reclined you felt the metal inside press up against the seat and when it settled into its final position felt loose/wobbly. Still a great theater though. I just hope they update the seats.< /Text>

Love this place! The recliner chairs are awesome. Food is good, but yes, prices are high because of all the amenities. I like going here because it's a nice experience and if you are in the mood for having a beer with your popcorn and movie, you can do that here.

The staff is nice and they do their best to keep the place as clean as possible... It's just hard to do sometimes when it's super busy.</Review>

<name>Jennifer Arntsen< /name><Time>1510433907284</Time><rate>1</rate><text>Completely understaffed on a Saturday. Literally 2 people working concessions and the line only gets longer and longer. Not even half way to the front of it after waiting 15minutes. Guest service guy was just sitting on his ass in his suit with a perfect view of the back up. The manager(?) eventually stepped up to help, though took about 5minutes for him to actually jump in and start assisting customers.
Such a crappy experience. Everyone in the lunch was complaining. Not the faults of the staff working, they were busting their butts.

Also only one person selling tickets at the window, so concession line was already after waiting to even buy the tickets.
I do not plan on returning here.< /text>< Pics>

I had a family situation pop up and could not attend. I went to the theater with the hope of getting a fund but wasnt too optomistic. That is until I met Assistant Manager Ryan Simpson. He was extremely helpful and swapped my digital ticket for a paper ticket for a show the next day. He would have gladly given me a full fund too. He made this the most painless process that anyone could hope for. He genuinly cared. Thank You Ryan</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Much nicer than most Regal Cinemas I've watched movies at. There's plenty of parking, easy location to find, several enjoyable restaurants nearby if you'd like to have a bite before or after.

My favorite part is the seating.  You can choose ahead of time your seat location and they have several spots for wheelchair access. The seats are recliners, which was quite comfortable... especially as I am disabled.

As for the staff, I encountered several and they were all very polite.

The only drawbacks I saw during my visit was the crazy long, long lines at the concession counter which moved very slowly.  My server seemed as if I were talking to a robot and annoyed by the couple of questions I had about their items. But when she went to get my order, she and another employee seemed to have acquired a happier personality until she returned with my order. Once I'd paid for my items, I felt rushed to leave. Unfortunately, I am disabled and can only carry my items in one hand and use my pockets for smaller items. She was young and maybe this is her first job; I can understand that. But maybe a different change of positions (i.e. ticket taker) may suit her personality better.

Overall, I had a great experience with the one exception, which I will overlook because almost all other visits there were spot on.

< Review>
Best Movie theater in San Diego area, period!

The staff was great as we were getting our popcorn. we didn't have to go through line to get our tickets,  wanna know why? Because we ordered our tickets online as they have reserved seats!  its perfect!. The building looks great and everything is brand spanking new.

The best part, RECLINING SEATS WITH A FOOD TRAY!. I was enjoying my time watching a movie, reclining and eating my popcorn, I felt like I was home or even better. The space between rows is so big that when people have to get up to the bathroom up you don't have to move a single inch. even while reclining :) .

I will be going to this theater more often, thank you Regal for not messing this one up!< /Review>

The movie theater is well maintained and clean, I usually always buy my tickets via an app and then show up and scan said tickets from my phone which is very convenient.

The concessions can take a while though, so I advise you arrive 30-40min prior to your movie starting if you're looking to get snacks.

The seats are nice and comfortable but in some theaters they are starting to show their age due to wear and tear, loose trays, etc. But nothing major.

It's located in the Carlsbad mall space close to lots of shopping and dining, making parking a bit of a pain if you don't arrive with plenty of time to spare.

Overall solid movie theater with an enjoyable atmosphere for the whole family.</Review>

The theater is nice. The seats are comfy. However, I depend heavily on closed captioning to watch movies and your devices are awful. They're uncomfortable and make me go cross eyed just from trying to read the captions. Either that or I have hold on to/adjust the glasses every few minutes so they're not squeezing my head. Imagine having to do this for Avengers Endgame of all things? I missed a big chunk of the beginning because I realized it didnt work. Then I had to leave the theater to go to the service desk and it was another several minutes until I finally got one that worked. That's unacceptable!<//Review>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Awesome theater! Super clean and very nice staff! The chairs are so nice! They have a sliding tray you can move in front of you, or move it to the side. The chair has leg rest you can raise up, so you can sit back and relax! The lobby is also very nice and clean! Employees are always making sure your taking care of and not worrying about something or anything. The reserved seating is very nice and handy, saves the headache.

****The only problem I have is I think after 10pm, they must turn the AC off. The theater's can get very hot and uncomfortable.</Text>< resp>

Good variety of new releases. Book early matinee and online to get preferred seats. Inquire about discounts (senior, student, deals, etc). athrooms and theater rooms are clean; great sound effects and large screen. Seats recline at this Regal.<//review>

<Response>None<//Response><user>114931807713317095853< /user><Text>Best Movie theater in San Diego area, period!

The staff was great as we were getting our popcorn. we didn't have to go through line to get our tickets,  wanna know why? Because we ordered our tickets online as they have reserved seats!  its perfect!. The building looks great and everything is brand spanking new.

The best part, RECLINING SEATS WITH A FOOD TRAY!. I was enjoying my time watching a movie, reclining and eating my popcorn, I felt like I was home or even better. The space between rows is so big that when people have to get up to the bathroom up you don't have to move a single inch. even while reclining :) .

I will be going to this theater more often, thank you Regal for not messing this one up!< /Text>< rate>

Did is the biggest sleeper here. You can get a great meal while your watch your movie which is a huge plus. Place is very clean and the seats are comfortable. No video games. Make sure you use an app to get your ticket beforehand. When there is a movie premiere, the lines can be a nightmare. Great service as well and experience of your from out of town.</text>

Was a great theater. Loved that they had adult beverages too. The seats were comfortable but slightly close together considering the size of them. The only real downside was there only being one person at the box office so it took forever.</Review>

<review>This cinema complex looked so nice when it opened a few years ago. Now it is extremely dirty! We went Saturday and it looked like no one had swept the rugs in ages. The trash was everywhere. The floors that were uncarpeted (tile, actual theater floor, bathroom floor) was so sticky that my shoes were still sticky when I got home. The women's bathroom was dirty and half the stalls were out of toilet paper. I hope this is not their new normal. Yuck!<//review>< pics>

<text>I really like this theater. I have the ability to not only pay for my tickets online, but also choose my seats. And the only bad seats in the house are probably the ones right up front, just like most theaters. The seats themselves aren't as new as they once were but they recline and are extra wide and comfy. I would rather drive the extra miles and be comfortable than go to a regular theater these days. Plus, the cost of the tickets are not any more expensive than other Regal Cinemas that have no reclining chairs. Also, every time I've been here, the theater has been clean and the employees friendly and helpful. Can't wait to come back again!<//text><date>1524804289704</date><Rating>5<//Rating>< username>

Love this movie theater! Tickets are on the expensive side, but if you learn how to save up points you can get the cost down a bit. Same with drinks and food. Seats are 10/10! They've ruined our seating experience at other theaters, forever!</Text>

Great new theater with the super comfortable seats and foot rests. It's expensive but worth it especially for a top movie that's important to you. It's nice to order on-line in advance and have a reserved seat. Also they are renovating the mall and once that's done, there will be nice shopping right there. They charge an extra $1.50 per ticket for free tickets and this is unusual. They need to change that.< /Review>

<Review>The reclining seats are awesome! They are so comfortable and just make the movie experience so much better. Also, the tray with cup holder makes everything more convenient. Overall, it's probably the nicest movie theatre I've ever been to.< /Review>< userid>

Nice theater, nice seats but concession service is absolutely ridiculous. The first 3 times I came here when it took 20 minutes to get through a line of 15 people I figured they were new and training people. Now after visit 9 and I stand in line missing my movie for still 20 minutes while 1 guy seemingly attempts to move as slow as possible I realize it's an accepted norm here. Several times I've seen 3 people at once stare at the popcorn machine for several minutes. Inevitably at least 2 of the 4 staff behind the counter just watch their coworkers over their shoulder while a line of 20 or more customers stare at them wondering why they are just standing there. Also a fun time when every single staff is under 21 and cant serve alcohol. Need major staff work and this theater could be great.</Text>

Wished people showed to their reserved seats.  Had to sit at the very front with plenty of seats behind me. Still great surround sound, cool reclining seats, and pretty good variety of stuff to eat.</Review>

<Review>This has become our favorite theater.  Reserved seating, reasonable prices, and the staff is extremely well-trained and friendly.  The snack bar has beer and wine, and the seats are very comfortable.  It's comparable to  a Cinepolis, but less expensive, and without the in-seat food service (which I find extremely distracting anyways).  My only complaint - and its a small one - is sometimes the hot dogs (Nathan's) are very good, and other times they are just okay.< /Review>< userid>

Typical movie theatre in a shopping mall. Good place for a date as there's lots of dinner options in the same complex. Friendly people working the concession...has food options beyond the usual fare. Seats recline with ample aisle room so you don't have to squish your legs up when someone in your row needs to go pee.<//Text>

We love the new theater at the Carlsbad mall. Fancy enough to be fun and comfortable, but not overpriced. The perfect place for a monthly dinner and movie date night.</review>

This has become our favorite theater.  Reserved seating, reasonable prices, and the staff is extremely well-trained and friendly.  The snack bar has beer and wine, and the seats are very comfortable.  It's comparable to  a Cinepolis, but less expensive, and without the in-seat food service (which I find extremely distracting anyways).  My only complaint - and its a small one - is sometimes the hot dogs (Nathan's) are very good, and other times they are just okay.</Review>

AC DOES NOT WORK IN THEATER #1!!!!!

I went and saw a special screening of My Neighbor Totoro in theater #1 and it was hot and humid in there. I asked the worker who scanned in our tickets and he said it has never worked for as long as he has worked there!!!! That has been over two years.

By the end of the movie, our backs stucked to the leather seats and I sweaty. In the future, I will ask for a refund if any other movies are assigned to this theater. You won't want to feel uncomfortable for the duration of the movie.<//Review>< Pics>

I really do like this theater. However, they are understaffed at the ticket window and the concession stand. They need to hire at least 10 more people to work during the busy times. I always get fandango tickets, but I usually end up waiting another 20 minutes just to get through concessions. And now they are checking purses, which takes even longer. The management is not very good.

I do love coming here for the seats, the convenience of location, and to enjoy a movie. But they need to figure out how to have enough people working to make things run smoother. There are about 6 ticket windows, they should all be open on a weekend or other busy times.<//Text>

<Review>I would not go to any other theater. The reclining seats make going to the theater smart again. It's a very clean theater every single time I've been here. It's just comfy. They serve beer and wine at the concessions. Pricy but worth it. Try to place a reservation a few hours ahead and you'll get better seating. I've sat in the front row, and while it's not the best experience at any theater- it's doable here.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This is a really nice, modern theater once you're seated. The main downfall, and reasons I didn't rate it 5 stars, is the slow service at both the concession and ticketing booths. Definitely plan on arriving 15 minutes early if you want to buy popcorns, drinks, etc.< /text>

If you're cursed enough to be put in the -front row- of the theater, you will be forced to lean your seat back and undergo ocular damage trying to watch a screen too big to be seen up close; and that's -if- your seat isn't busted and incapable of leaning back in the first place.

Add the overpriced food and the fact that this is attached to a mall that has literally -no- food court (just crowded sit-down restaurants), and you've got a crummy experience coming your way. If this is your -only- option for watching movies- wait for the Blu-ray and don't give this business your money.<//Text>< pics>

Very nice location. Weekend staff regularly seem unmotivated and unaffected by long lines whether at concessions or just to enter the cinemas. Great seats, though the front few rows can be a serious neck strain.

Update: show up at least 30m early if you want to purchase any concessions. The last two times I have seen something here I've shown up 15m early and still missed the first 30m of my showing jus to get a coke.</Review>

There is no lighting so it's really hard to see your assigned seat and people have to get right in front of the screen to find their seats. If you don't buy your tickets ahead of time, you may miss the movie all together and ruin the night. The cost of the tickets is so high that it makes you stick to Netflix or other rental alternatives, unless the movie is absolutely worthy of the high priced big screen. All that said, the seats are very comfortable and your not exactly elbowing the person seating next to you.<//text>< pictures>

This is by far the best theater for comfort and big screens in the area. We probably see at least 3 movies each month here. However, I was disheartened recently, when I was compelled to watch the preview of Al Gore's upcoming climate change movie. The science behind climate change is hardly settled, yet the fear mongering and blatant distortions apparent in this propagandist movie are not on my list of what I would consider to be an enjoyable experience at the theater.
One more thing. I really wish people would pick up after themselves. Have you ever stayed until the lights come back up after the ending credits? It's disgusting how much trash people leave. They would never do that at home or if the lights were up. Quite sad.<//Text>

We love this theater ever since it opened up. What we found tonight was disappointing to see.  A lot of the seats are worn out and had holes the cushions and cracks in the material.  Many of the seats numbers are worn out and unreadable and there were a few chairs that the recline function we're not in working order.</Review>

<text>Great sound and comfortable reserved seating make this theater a winner in my book. The only reason it's not 5 stars is mostly the employees. They didn't seem happy at all and didn't really care about the patrons. Just overall lack of good customer service. This was during a matinee showing so maybe they just weren't awake yet... At 1pm on a Monday. 🤔 Whatever the reason, nothing about the employee attitudes made me want to come back again. Not that they were rude. They just seemed apathetic. Reminded me of Fry's electronics employees (nothing to aspire to). I can only hope this was just the summer crew and customer service will be better again once Fall hits.

My only other observation is their nice recliners are starting to look a bit run down. There are patches of missing leather/pleather coating missing from the headrests, an obvious sign of normal wear and tear.i had some of it rub off on my shirt. Didn't even notice it until someone else pointed it out. Might wanna brush your shoulders off after your movie ends, just to be safe!

Overall it's a nice theater with a little room for improvement. Hopefully they can do better next time, but if not that still won't knock it off my list of favorite places to catch a flick. It just won't ever be #1 again like it used to be.</text><user_name>Mike Long</user_name><date>1532393246158<//date>< Rate>

I'm gonna nitpic on this otherwise great theater, and that's on the way-too-bright EXIT signs inside each theater.  They CAN and SHOULD reduce the light on those after the movie starts.  It's too distracting.  Otherwise, great seats, great service.</review>

I can't believe there are people on here complaining about the movie theater! Don't go back then! leave it for people like me who LOVE THE SEATING AND THEATER! Take it from someone who has been going to movies for 50+ years---this theater, its seats and size and sound system ROCK! The first time I went--I was sooooo happy to have it all---a comfy recliner, tray for my popcorn, drink holder in the tray and roomy seats so you aren't sharing arm rests etc...! It's total bliss for serious movie goers. Complainers need to stay home or go to other theaters!<//text>

This theater is great. My only 'complaint' is too many snack bar options. I wanted half the menu. I am very pleased every visit. The restrooms are close to the theaters and sparkling and spotless. I pre purchase seats online because I am very particular about where I sit.</Text>

<Review>This was my first experience with reserved and reclining seats and I don't think I ever want to go back! It's worth the additional cost.
During my visit the seat next to me with another guest wasn't working, but the employees helping were so discrete I forgot they were there fixing it during previews. And the gentleman was simply moved to a neighboring seat with no issues.<//Review><user>112118685506274995338</user>< Pics>

<review>This poor rating is due to horrible customer service that I received today at the service desk. Me and my husband go to movies to this theater very often. So I had over 30K in Crown Club Regal points, that qualified me to 2 free tickets. I asked service desk a few month ago there,  how to redeem and they instructed to do it online. So I went online and did what they instructed to do, but never got tickets. So I came today, inquiring about that, and Veronica Bayne told me that she could see that I redeemed but it was expired, and there is nothing she could do about it. She was completely not helpful, and couldn't wait to finish the encounter. She had 2 other employees just hanging around, not seems to care about guests at all. You would think that they would treat someone that comes to see movies there weekly with more understanding and respect. When I asked whom I can submit a complain, she just wrote some phone number for me, didn't seems to care at all.<//review>< pictures>

<review>Place is great. As things move along they'll upgrade to Atmos, etc. Perfect picture and sound in my movie--and huge screen, great seats. Barely anyone said a word on a Friday night.

They use the bait and switch at the snack bar.  One price is advertised all over the place but when you get to the front (after a 20 minute wait) they are out of that deal and can give you something similar for triple the price.   Very sneaky and unprofesssional.</text>

I love this spot. Pick your seating from your phone while still at work from your cell phone through their app.  Grab a great tasting Burger or just the classic hot dog or pop corn. Heck, grab a glass of wine or a cold beer if that's your thing. Then lay waaayy back in the theatre recliners. Simply put,...awesome.....< /Text>

One of those fancy theaters where you choose your seating beforehand (like an airplane) and the seats have electronic adjustment and lean back, foot rest extends. The most liesurely way to watch "Welcome to my Neighborhood" on the big screen. The downside is the cost. $27 for me and the wife to go here, no snacks, matinee hours. The theater is great but I wouldn't go back for the cost alone. I don't know whether this theater accepts Moviepass.<//review>

The big disappointment came when we walked into the lobby area... what a MESS popcorn all over the floor and the hallways were just as bad.  We both used the ladies room and experienced the same thing- toilet paper all over the  floor in the stalls and water all over the sink area.  knowing Sundays are usually busy they need more janitorial help we certainly pay a premium and expect a great experience.</Text><user_name>ginarae Clasen</user_name>< pics>

<text>We were told by the box office cashier that the movie we wanted to see "was almost sold out". We hesitantly bought tickets at the front row and $32 worth of snacks (!). It was impossible for us to enjoy the movie so close. When the movie was over I looked up and almost HALF of the theater was empty! Either we were lied to or there is incredible ineptness at that theater. This is the 2nd time this has happened! I'm not going back.....< /text>< pictures>

< review>
Went to see the special TCM Fathom Events showing of Ben Hur. I was shocked to see the movie was too dimly illuminated and all the colors were murky. Their projection equipment isn't up to the task of showing classic epic movies of the past in their original widescreen Technicolor glory. The colors and illumination are much better watching my DVD of Ben Hur at home on my big screen TV! TCM and Fathom Events, don't use this theater for your future events!</review>

<Review>My daughter and I went to see Kong on Sunday, March 26/2017.  We love this theater because it is so close to our home..  The big disappointment came when we walked into the lobby area... what a MESS popcorn all over the floor and the hallways were just as bad.  We both used the ladies room and experienced the same thing- toilet paper all over the  floor in the stalls and water all over the sink area.  knowing Sundays are usually busy they need more janitorial help we certainly pay a premium and expect a great experience.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1491256698989, 'text': 'ginarae Clasen, thank you for visiting Regal Cinemas Carlsbad 12, and leaving a review.

< Review>
This movie theater is pretty dank but pretty expensive. They offer nice seats and of course everyone wants the middle seats so get them early. It sucks that tickets cost $15 but that's where MoviePass comes in. You have to show ID for MoviePass so have it. I've been here plenty of times and never had a bad experience just comfy seats with a limited seating theater, so movies can fill up quick.< /Review>

The seating is wonderful, we don't go anywhere else anymore but the popcorn service completely sucks because the last four times that I have bought popcorn there I have asked for buttered, layered popcorn, you have to ask for this if you want butter in the middle of your popcorn and just not on top, and I have only have had butter put on the top making it necessary to go get butter for the middle on down during the movie. I really appreciate this counter manager even after I have complained about this it still happens so I can only assume your counter people have been trained to do this deceptive method or they don't know what I mean by layered but they have never asked me what I mean and have told me they do know what layered means.</text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Warning: Do not buy tickets for the front row. They are closer to the screen than any theater I've ever seen. It's like putting the bottom of a book to your nose and trying to read both pages. People on the screen are distorted beyond recognition (shaped like pears with tiny heads). The upper third of the frame is dark. And you have to move your head back and forth to see the whole image.

Other than that, I love this theater with their spacious, reclining seats.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

A comparable much more reasonable alternative to Cineopolis. No seat service but still comfortable reclining leather seats. No lobster salad 😉 but fun ballpark food.< /Text>

<review>Please....terrible

Kids were literally fighting in the theater and neither their guardian or the theater staff would do anything.

Went to see Antman and Wasp. I complained about the children to the theater staff but they didn’t do anything.

At the end the kids were fist fighting and almost punched my son. The manager gave us a set of free tickets. BS. How about kicking people out who can’t follow rules.

<review>It was O.K. Who could possibly sit in the first four rows, without their head exploding? I was really depressed I had to actually walk. That I wasn't picked up from my home, driven to the theater, and had my fat, lazy, bloated North County a@@, carried to my seat. Then, given a foot massage while I stuffed my face with steak, and where was the place to smoke my medical marijuana? And how about seat /toilets combined. Save me from getting up during the show! It's dark and loud. The two good things were the comfortable lounge seat and the great sound but, why were there other people there? It should be only for me, and maybe a few people I know.  MAYBE.  Also, WHERE WAS the waiter to take my order? I just want to be a fat selfish Carlsbadian. Forget everyone else! And if you live somewhere else don't even come here! Now I have to drive my Lexus (which I just has detailed) through the coastal mist to my my 25,000 square foot house on the beach, and cry because someone else has more stuff than me,  and it sprinkled this morning..........Waaaaaa...........</review>< pictures>

These seats are worn down, and the screen is all jacked up, causing a very noticeable effect that takes you out of the movie. They really let this place fall into shambles.<//Text>

We have a short pleasant conversation. I joke around, purchased 2 tixs and left, .but I came back 5mins later to get one more ticket for a friend who's on the way. Adriana made sure we sit together. Customer service to it's finest. Place and staff are excellent, but the movie we picked totally ruin the whole movie going experienced. I left the house to go to a movie, .not to a political rally. I just want to see a movie, . not to pick political side. Before this, we watched 'the 1st purge', same thing, also a disappointment. Me and friends choose this place to meet. But Hollywood looney and anti-Trump cannot put their hatred aside, that even on the movie, their ugliness are showing. It must be all those drugs their taking. We feel trick to go to that movie, so their sorry 'A' can make money.<//text>< Pics>

Horrible customer service. Was the only person in line with one person in front of us already at the sales window. Stood in line for almost 10 minutes as the person in front of us bought multiple gift cards. During this time, the manager and one other employee entered the sales booth and stood there, as approximately 8-10 other people entered the sales line behind me. At no point did the manager or the other employee call for someone else to come and assist with sales, or make any effort to help those waiting in line. This caused several people to use the automated ticket kiosk, because the line was not moving. Maybe this is their goal, to make people use the automated ticket kiosks, but that level of avoidance in completely ignoring the people standung right in front of her by the nanager is ridiculous and completely unacceptable.</text>

<Review>Went in Tuesday night after work. Had everything plan out with my girlfriend that we were going to watch "Friends" which is rated R17. The manager Deana who was getting my ticket ask for my ID, but I did not had it with me and I am 28 years old and I came here on Tuesday night every now and then and they never ask for my ID. Never thought that they would ask me for my ID to watch movie R17. So she did not sell me the ticket even though I show her my photo ID from my phone. She also said they its a company policy that I have to show ID to her. I wonder if I am 50 years of age, would she still card me because of the policy? I really feel offended by her judgement, and it really ruin my night. My level of satisfaction of this place below average and I hope that they are aware that the business is still running because of customers. I really hope that they pay more attention on customer satisfaction.</Review><user_name>Vacharit pliensupab<//user_name>< pictures>

Their front 3 rows are unreasonably close to the screen making it obvious that they are more interested in sucking every penny they can out of a customer than offering a great experience for all. Those rows should be 1/2 price for the distorted screen view and ensuing headache from being 2 feet from the screen.< /Text>

100% love this as my first choice to go to the movies, it's comfy with the recining seats, and a great value compared to Cineopolis, which is great but expensive and not really.... better. Give it a try, also it's on the bus line so I appreciate that as a parent of teens, I can just pop then on the bus here in Encinitas and I know it's safe, clean, nice, and they can kill time at the mall afterward, so what's not to like? There's a Peet's next door which for me seals the deal.< /text>

Love the comfortable recliner seating.  We come out from Murrieta whenever it's a movie we are really excited to see.  Love being able to select my seats ahead of time and not have to worry if my family will all get seats together.  Wish we had a theater like this in Murrieta.<//Review>

Best movie theater I've been to and I've been to a lot all over San Diego! It's just as comfy as cinapolis and arclight but without the super high prices. Do yourself a favor and book your tickets online before you show up.<//Text>

We were there for BFG's Premier June 30, 2016. Having arrived 50 minutes prior to listed showtime. We waited to get concession's forever!!! Ended up not getting popcorn for fear of missing out on previews, etc.. Just have a runner standing by. Person who listens while customer is ordering, get's items while the other takes money, finishes transaction. This person may help others as well. Or get the manager out on the floor. People were talking about the LONGEST wait ever that night!!!< /Review>< Pics>

Went to see Deadpool double feature so i actually ordered real food.  Chicken tenders and fries (if u consider that real food)...but it was actually good.  The make it frehs, so it takes few minutes but was actually good.  Seats very comfortable (recliner style) and clean bathrooms.  Popcorn was jsut average...kind of bland, needs salt<//review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Don't sit in the front row! The seats are very comfortable and the theater is very nice. What I didn't like was that we were seated in the first row and it was giving all 5 of us a headache trying to watch the action in the previews. Our ages ranged from 27 to 83. No way was I going to pay full price for such a poor viewing experience! They gave us a refund but it's been 2 weeks and it still had not been processed. I can't locate a number to call the theater directly anywhere so I will have to go there to inquire about my refund. Good thing I'm still in town since I was here for the holidays.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc7188fc169e45:0x797a65e5bea73f59<//gmap_id></record>

This theatre would have gotten a zero if that was a choice. My first time at this location in March, I bought my tickets online. When I got to the theatre they could not find my purchase or  the seats I choose. I pulled up my receipt on my phone to show proof of purchase. They finally could confirm that I indeed paid for my tickets. I was then told I had to choose different seats because the seats I choose show that they are taken, " of course they are by me". I just want to watch the movie with my son so I choose  different seats. The purchase of my ticket was in the morning but by 7pm there were no good seats, just the ones at the front.. which I hate. I decided to just go watch the movie and let it go. I was given no opology this was no fault of mine. We went to our seats the recliner didn't work , being so close to the screen hurt my eyes and the original seats I choose were empty the entire showing.
Forward to today, learning my lesson from my first experience, I choose to purchase my ticket at the booth "there will be no mistake this time it  is my son's birthday". I was wrong, I choose section F and read the seat numbers I prefer, 3 seats to the guy in the booth. My mistake was not double checking the ticket. We got our popcorn and drink and was so excited to watch the movie. We were early
and were watching previews.  We got to the F row seats I choose 18, 19, and 20. I was face to face and this person got it wrong. I didn't know until a couple said one of our 3 seats were theirs. I took my ticket out to check but they said it's ok there were empty seats in front. About 20 minutes into the movie a older gentleman came and ask if my seat was #1 I replied no this is # 20 a husher came and ask for our ticket studs . I couldn't find it right away and she said don't worry about it. About 30 minutes in the movie another husher came in by this time I locate the ticket. He told us our seats are in the D section. I said I asked for the F section because the last time I was there thats all the seats they had and i did not enjoy the movie from that section. I decide to deal with a real person and they still messed up my seating, we had to move after sitting for 35 minutes and being disrupted muliple times for a mistake that was not my fault. I didn't want to ruin my son's birthday, so I let him and his friend watch the movie, while I get a refund for mine. I will never come back to this theatre ever again.< /text>

Very dissaponted! I recently visited regle cinema 12 i came to purchase a ticket for a showing that was on the website for 11:45 pm and when I came to the ticket booth to purchase my ticket (keep in mind that I am coming from Poway) the lady told me that they took off the showing of the movie when on the website it clearly stated there was a showtime for 11:45. And I checked the website prior to coming.  This experience has never happened to me! I don’t understand how the theater of Carlsbad would update from there end but not their website. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to call before showing up!< /text>

100% love this as my first choice to go to the movies, it's comfy with the recining seats, and a great value compared to Cineopolis, which is great but expensive and not really.... better. Give it a try, also it's on the bus line so I appreciate that as a parent of teens, I can just pop then on the bus here in Encinitas and I know it's safe, clean, nice, and they can kill time at the mall afterward, so what's not to like? There's a Peet's next door which for me seals the deal.< /Review>

<Text>The seats are great, and that's it. The theaters are tiny and everything is overpriced. I had the worst experience I've ever had at a movie theatre 2 days ago. We went out to celebrate my fiancé's birthday(with our 1 year old),and waited through their ridiculous lines, bought their expensive concession items, and found our assigned seats. Right as the movie starts, an usher comes in and starts shining his light in people's faces. He then walked up to us and asked to see our ticket, so we showed it to him, and he left. He then came back and said we have the wrong tickets (to a later movie, that our son couldn't watch). We told him they must have sold us the wrong ticket because we wouldn't take our son to an R rated movie, and he left again, leaving us to think we were okay to stay.
We were wrong. Next a manager came in, shining her light in our eyes.   Right away the manager blamed us and said we needed to leave the seats, because another family had the correct tickets for the seat. My fiancé and I were furious,needless to say. The manager made us leave and return to the lobby.  We told her we wanted a refund for our tickets and concessions. So she told us to pick a different date and time to come see the movie. We told her "We are parents of a young child, we can't just pick an exact date and time, spur of the moment, obviously. So we would rather have two tickets for whenever.  " she acted like it was impossible for her to do, and we argued a bit. Then she said she'd go speak to the GM. She came back and suddenly was able pull out a roll of free tickets and hand us two  -.-
So, in short, the manager's not a people person(and obviously a liar), the workers sell the wrong tickets to assigned seats, and everything is expensive. If I were you, I'd go somewhere else and save your money.<//Text>< gmapID>

So theater is nice, not quite cinalopis but reserved, reclining seats are a plus. The issue is that fandango ( which is the only way to buy tickets besides walking into the location) continuously messes up or is unable to process ticket orders. When contacting their customer service there is up to an hour of wait time and even then they are unhelpful and I was informed they can not support apple devices. I would recommend regal 12 use another ticket service. Like I said like the theater the issues with ticket purchasing means ill be spending my time at the cinalopis... hello drinks in theater :)< /Text>

Big, comfortable recliner seats; You can reserve your tickets in advance; Also, if you use the Atom App, you can pre-purchase your snacks/drinks, and skip the concession line!</Review>

The seats are great, and that's it. The theaters are tiny and everything is overpriced. I had the worst experience I've ever had at a movie theatre 2 days ago. We went out to celebrate my fiancé's birthday(with our 1 year old),and waited through their ridiculous lines, bought their expensive concession items, and found our assigned seats. Right as the movie starts, an usher comes in and starts shining his light in people's faces. He then walked up to us and asked to see our ticket, so we showed it to him, and he left. He then came back and said we have the wrong tickets (to a later movie, that our son couldn't watch). We told him they must have sold us the wrong ticket because we wouldn't take our son to an R rated movie, and he left again, leaving us to think we were okay to stay.
We were wrong. Next a manager came in, shining her light in our eyes.   Right away the manager blamed us and said we needed to leave the seats, because another family had the correct tickets for the seat. My fiancé and I were furious,needless to say. The manager made us leave and return to the lobby.  We told her we wanted a refund for our tickets and concessions. So she told us to pick a different date and time to come see the movie. We told her "We are parents of a young child, we can't just pick an exact date and time, spur of the moment, obviously. So we would rather have two tickets for whenever.  " she acted like it was impossible for her to do, and we argued a bit. Then she said she'd go speak to the GM. She came back and suddenly was able pull out a roll of free tickets and hand us two  -.-
So, in short, the manager's not a people person(and obviously a liar), the workers sell the wrong tickets to assigned seats, and everything is expensive. If I were you, I'd go somewhere else and save your money.<//Review>

even if the movie sucks (most do these days) at least the leather recliner seats are great for a 2 hour nap.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I've never had a decent experience at this theater. Having assigned seats instead of standard open seating makes it incredibly difficult get a halfway decent seat for yourself, unless you arrive hours before the movie starts, let alone get seats together when you go with family or friends.  The matinee tickets aren't terribly expensive but the senior and student discounts only apply after 4 pm which seems like a little bit of a copout.

I may have some bias as this new theater put my favorite small theater across the street out of business which had incredibly cheap tickets, food, and plenty of excess seating (people could show up right as the trailers were starting and still get a great seat), but I personally have never enjoyed a movie going experience at this theater. Try somewhere else or stick with Netflix.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

BEWARE!  I went there on a Saturday, so it wasn't unusually crowded, and had to wait in line 20 minutes for popcorn/drinks.  Then, we had to wait in another line to get into the theaters, because they were checking everyone's purses.  They had a sign there by the podium (but NOT before you buy the tickets or wait in line for popcorn), that they were checking for security reasons.  But they weren't patting down the men, when 100% of theater shootings have been men, but just looking in women's purses.  That is a gross violation of privacy.  If they had really been concerned with security, they should focus on the men.  They were obviously using the shootings as an excuse to look for snacks being brought in the purses from outside.  Shame on you!  We missed the start of the movie because of this nonsense.< /text>

Everyone elses negative reviews hits it the nail on the head. I have seen a few of the staff just being rude. I don't know what people honestly think but this is their job. You wake up get dress and serve popcorn or print correct tickets. Ive had friends meet me then be kicked out later for a wrong ticket the front printed out. Heaven forbid you have to talk to them, because they will only make it sound like your fault. My main gripe is the the reserved seating bullshit (pardon my language). Countless times I've used fandango and ordered tickets (decent seating due to ordering a few days in advance). I'll check fandango and the computer out front of seat avalibility when the times comes because that's the person I am always checking random stuff like that. Fandango and the computer out front will show a fully booked theater only to end up being 1/5 full. The theater doesn't care because they already got their money from someone but if you wanted to walk in from the street like most people your "SOL". Ive broken the Taboo rule a few times and moved seats to a better area because they remained empty and i didn't want to crane my neck. FYI just pick the back 2 rows for movies the theater is so small they are almost perfect seats. Don't let the Fandango seating chart confuse you.< /Review>

Go here to see every movie, look people welcome to the future! If you don't like the reserved seating than you are just doing it wrong! I love it, buy my ticket hours before the showing and have basically empty theater to choose from usually, than show up right as the showing starts and no hassle just print your ticket at the machines by the customer service desk and enjoy! The food is 200% over charged but that's any movie theater so no whining at least they give you a refill on Large orders unlike Cinepolis! Have never once had a problem with fandango besides once which was user error cuz I didn't press confirm purchase. But ya really I am so glad movie theaters are catching up with the times because for someone who is an avid movie goer this makes life easy! now just make your food cheaper please!<//Review>

<review>Same morons better seats. Idiots talking and bring their babies ruin the whole thing. The first row is a complete joke and should not be sold at all. You can NOT watch a movie from their first row and barley from the 2nd row. Cinepolis blows this place in the weeds as far as class. Much more grown up people that have manners. Well worth the extra 8 bucks. and the ticket line? BAWAHAHAHAHA, takes 15 minutes to stand in line for a ticket. The ONLY time this place good to go in on Monday mornings when the morons are not there.

<Text>Regal Carlsbad is the love child of Cinepolis La Costa and Regal Oceanside. It’s got the lounging chairs, reserved seating and space of Cinepolis, but is more affordable with the more normal amenities of what people are more used to of a theater more than 3 years old.

Don’t get me wrong, when I go to Cinepolis it’s for cocktails, maybe some gastropub type food and a solid movie experience that is all you get what you pay for, but sometimes I don’t want to spend so much and don’t mind seeing a less than sold out matinee show, alone or whatever.

It’s actually smaller than I expected and in a good way I didn’t realize the expansion was really more for 24 as Luna and Regal could have easily been renovated without expansion.

I like the indoor ticketing, I like the auto kiosks. I like ordering via mobile since I have VIP rewards and I think there is better quality food. I’m glad they went with thinner more paper tickets. Probably saving a ton of money off just that little change. Plenty of parking.

I don’t like the bathrooms since they are basic, the hand dryers are super loud, I really wish places would have concessions closer to the theaters, maybe even behind the security portion. I don’t even use my tickets, I just show my phone now. Call me weird, but I like the seasoning powder and wish more places would carry it. They got me sneaking in my own seasoning here.

All in all it’s a great addition that has brought something back to the area. Lets face it when Mann and other theater left everyone went with them. I also think La Costa can service all of NCounty looking for full luxury. Prices are higher, service is better, it’s a new facility, but it’s still at “the mall”.</Text></record>

This place can get really busy, and if it wasn't for movie pass, I would think this place is really expensive ( cause it is), but it's worth it cause they have a large selection of movies and really nice reclining seats. The prices for the food is fine, but I don't really get anything beyond soda and popcorn. Ample parking (unless it's a Friday or Saturday night)</review>

The theater itself if ok. No HFR, not Atmos, but my god, the audience in every showing is on their cell phones and talking through the whole film. Also the crosstalk on 3d showings is absolutely horrendous.</Text>

They need to fix their seats. Row A,B, and C are way to close to the screen and on top of that, alot of the seats that are supposed to recline don't work.</review>

Online reservations using Premiere Movie Tickets (gift tickets) stinks!  Could not use them because they are not a "card" and have no "pin number."  System needs to be updated to allow for gift tickets as well as cards.  Also, when calling the number of the theatre to explore a resolution to this situation, I could not reach a human being; only the endlessly annoying automated attendant.  VERY frustrating.< /Text>

They mistakenly booked for the wrong showtime and by the time I realized it they had barely any seats left for the showtime I had asked for. Service was also horrible from the cashier to the service desk.< /text>

They have Wyndham timeshares sales people in the lobby. On the way out of the theater I'm walking with my wife and 3 year old kid and friends. The Wyndham sales guys are trying to get us to spin the wheel to get a prize. We're in the middle of a conversation and we aren't paying attention. As we're walking buy the 2 sales guys literally just start talking trash about me saying "Yeah. That's really funny, just keep on walking and laughing" and other really rude comments about my wife and me. I was so mad I was going to turn around and confront them but my wife said just let it go and keep walking. Shame on you Regal for allowing these people in your theater. I was offended. You ruined my night out with my family. I will not be going back to this theater again. I am disappointed I spent $60 on a night out with my family to be offended. I know ultimately it was the Wyndham sales guys, but you let these predators and dirt bags into your theater. This is your responsibility. Never again.<//Text>< Pics>
