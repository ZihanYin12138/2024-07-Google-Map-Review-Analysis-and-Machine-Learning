<Review>My girlfriend and I stopped by here today since we were in the Burbank area enjoying the nice sunny weather after the rain. She loves Coffee Bean and its so hard to find now near our place due to covid and the mall limitation. But the location in Burbank is always the saver for her. When we got to the place, we were able to just walk up to the counter and put in her order. She loves their Mocha Latte, we actually had our first date at a Coffee Bean but the one in Northridge. It didn't take long for her drink to be ready since there was no other orders pending. Finding parking here would probably be the most difficult part. Due to covid, more spots are available than before but we usually park at the police station down the street since it's easier to get out and is not compact. It also gives you the opportunity to get some steps in and explore Burbank. The customer service we received was also spectacular.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1R-x5LORUiLIboclNcJQdq8WPN6lOaZiC-wLK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnbi34cMZ5bVJel4PDEe0H3pjp8p15itkV15uc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlD69vRxoe0xyANiG567ijY-SY9DeArB3Bh3fN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ4QsuZp1r-p1MwxZcCvr58NHhTkhsL3G-eYCp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDOHx7PWQX-GeiS4jX54_lq3akHG6d-qj5JNhv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqDia-7zMsNSq5nv9tbl9oouK5LBWG7ocF1s8j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8SOUu7e_2xetfgLbye7dlAtMK2eUWAQe_sI9W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ7iraYNUn_o3ga_GY5xoAAJvLPK4LI800kJUe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxOA64AKNQN3ljVCFhhDzvzYlZh3NlAXZH25Gx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Date>

It was packed on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered the iced mocha. It was the best iced mocha I have ever had. Soooo much better than Starbucks. They use real small pieces of chocolate and mix it with the coffee. None of the syrup stuff. Delicious! I can't wait to come back and have another cup of iced mocha.</Text>

The kids really enjoyed their cinnamon roll and chocolate shake, which of course they're not going to complain when they get that for breakfast. The Mommy and me really enjoyed our coffee, she had the maple ice latte and that was really yummy, I had a sip. I had the Vietnamese cold brew, first I've had that, and nice and strong.

Also as you can see, a good amount of Pokemon Go stops :-)</text>

<Review>This coffee shop has quickly become one of my favorite spots, and even though it's quite far from my place,  it was worth it.  For me, they had the most delicious coffee in the area.  The coffee shop itself was indeed wonderful. The barista was indeed an expert making a great coffee.  I can't wait to visit this shop again.< /Review><UserId.>113436946078978832784< /UserId.><Name>Fraser Crouch<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Coffee at least as good as Starmegabuks. And almost $1 cheaper for large. Good toilet, but they got rid of "occupied " lock. And they have PAPER TOWELS. But no newspapers either. So walk an extra 600 feet from the Theaters,  you'll  be pleased.< /text>

<Review>Great service!  Was turned away at Starbucks because all I had was a $100 dollar bill to pay, despite wanting to spend almost $30 on coffee and pastries.  This Coffee Bean happily helped me.  The service was friendly and fast.  Pretty much converted now.  Thanks Coffee Bean staff!!!< /Review>< pics>

I have always received great service at this location. But not today. Today I went in for my usual drink. The cashier was great and friendly. The Batista on the other hand was less than satisfactory. I understand that her job requires her to be friendly and have conversations with customers, however when those conversations interfere with her job performance then that becomes a problem. I'll be very blunt about it. She got my order wrong and when I told her, I received a little attitude because I was interfering with her conversation.
Other then this I would of gave this place 5 stars.< /review>

The latte was good, but the almond croissant was a bit stale.  Tha barista forgot she was heating it for me, so I had to remind them to give it to me.  The bathroom was out of TP. And their solution was paper towels - not impressed, and they blamed it on their service and took zero responsibility.  All-in-all, not an impressive experience.<//text>

Thank you for the excellent bean choices for the Java-to-go! Everyone loves it!!!!

Ordered two boxes of Java-to-go for meeting, one light roast and one dark roast. I think it's Mexican Organic and Bright future (perfect for our meeting!! Haha). Called ahead and they are ready when arrive (called before 7 for a pick up at 9:30). The barista helps me carry them to my car.

I would definitely look for these two beans (yes it's that good!). :)</text>

The Mango tea was to die for. It was not just good but also cheap. If you need a place to work (good wifi and clean bathroom), I highly recommend it. I had some time to kill and time just flew at this place.</Text>

Right around the corner from the AMC Theater, there’s a nice little coffee joint called the Coffee Bean. I like it cause the service is fast mostly friendly (though not always) and affordable for what you get. Which is to say, delicious coffee/tea and other drinks. I got myself a White Chocolate Frap and my gf got an Arizona Sunrise tea. They were both delicious and refreshing drinks on a perfectly sunny day.<//text>

The other was nice but if I come in with a smile and leave aggravated that's not a pleasant experience. Step up your customer service game.<//Review>< user_id>

<review>We often come here when we are in LA because the hotel we (used to) stay at is nearby. I was not happy at our most recent visit, because they forgot to make the coffee I ordered and then when I brought this to their attention they had to confer with each other to decide whether or not I was trying to scam them, or if I had actually paid for something I didn't receive.< /review>< name>

Nothing impressive. Cochinita Pibil was really salty. Portions are ok. Aguas frescas are expensive. Service is good, though.</Review>

<date>1567459215281<//date><Review>Went there today and the ladies in the store ripped us off. We purchased 6 golden plates, receipt says, “Charger CHPGN” for $4.99 each with a 25% discount...wow sounds great! We get home, and ALL OF THEM were priced $3.99. The sticker above said $4.99. We went back and they said they could refund us the money and then charge us the 3.99 plus the 25% discount because of Labor Day. The Lady who helped us said she couldn’t because the computer wouldn’t let her. Why not respect the original price and not rip people off? Check the stickers before you buy them. This place will rip you off. ALL of their plates had a sticker on top with a higher price.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is an updated post. I did post a 2 star originally. I did because I was a bit frustrated with the website telling me items I wanted were available at store. They weren't. Three different times. Nonetheless, I still enjoy my Pelendale store. Mostly it's the people who work there. Great people. If you've been there you'll know. If not go see.</review>

< review>
The cashier insisted on copying my I'd information and number on a peice of paper because I used a visa gift card to pay for gas.  The transaction was already approved.  He wanted my phone number as well. I requested this establishments number and the number he gave me was the City of Davis police department.  I found this out when I tried calling that number to make a complaint.  I of course easily found the correct number, called to speak to manager and he answered the phone  and stated he was the manager. This was the second lie he's told and and for what reason other than he obviously doesn't want it known that something just isn't right about business that goes on there< /review>

<text>Consistently one of the best prices gas stations in Davis.  Pumps have RFID (Tap capable) readers on them which makes the transaction safer.  Shop has lots of alcohol and is hardly ever that busy.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
The bathrooms tend to be clean enough, but not so welcoming.
Be careful when you are driving away. The driveway isn't very clear when leaving, so it's quite common to watch vehicles bottom out driving over the curb when exiting.</review>

<review>Have tried using a Valero card, BOA debit, and BOA credit card inside and outside. They never worked and the staff seemed suspicious of me. Was able to get gas at any other Valero or gas station. Thought it was a bad day but it happened again.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>One gas pump says credit card doesn't work at the pump.  So I had to go in to the cashier.  He needs me to tell him exactly how much to fuel.  I just wanted to fill up the tank and he refused.  Very bizarre.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Nope, not good pepo!

If this is my opportunity to complain to the Kooks, make it to the owner, then I'll take it.

I was supposed to get a mini super quesadilla, but all I'm in case super quesadilla is is a quesadilla with meat. Nothing really super about it so I call it super. When I got three pieces, I had already eaten too and I realized there was no meat. I went back to talk to the Kooks and this is what they gave me. A pile of me on top of the last piece of quesadilla. I went back to talk to the person who took our order and he Shrugged his shoulders and said well it's the cooks fault.

Personally, I don't care whose fault it is but if nobody wanted to take initiative and make things better, then oh well here we go.

Enjoy your food everybody, and you probably will, someplace else. :-)</text>

< Review>
Food was not good at all ordered a el pastor burrito had a rice burrito with a little meat what little bit of meat there was had no flavor. Tacos were a good size but again flavorless and the crane asada fries were not good at all either fries were extremely under cooked.  Bread for the torta was hard as a rock could have knocked someone out with it, the meat inside was full of grissel and overloaded with mayonnaise lettuce we definitely won't be eating here again and definitely not recommended.</Review>

I got a 3 cheese enchilada combo plate, a carne asada burrito, and a 12 oz can of Budweiser, it came out to $20.25.  The food was good but the portions are sure getting small.  Hopefully they realize that higher prices and smaller portions are not a good business model 🙄</text>

Solid! Took the kids in for tacos on Sunday night. Was not disappointed at all.
I also took home some chicharones from the meet counter.
Absolutely delicious 😋!!!
There is a special every day of the week.<//text>

I love this place. I treat myself and visit at least twice a month. Authentic not Americanized food. Any true lover of Mexican food will tell you the food is only half of what counts, the salsa or sauce is the other half and their red sauce is the best anywhere. We use to have a few places like this in the High Desert years gone by. I think this might be the last authentic Mexican food place left.<//Review>

The best fish tacos I have found. El pastor is bomb. They have cleaned it up & Employees are nice. Would good them a 5 excerpt I don't  like the smell of the Raw Meat counter as you walk in the door. Have been coming here since the "90's"</Review>

<Text>You're at first captivated by quaint little spot and you can see the food being made. But don't let it fool you this place Royally sucks. The price is over-rated for what they give. I asked for a hot-sauce per burrito I purchased and they seriously huddled together for some mini meeting before it was "approved" and I was okayed to get some hot sauce. I'll NEVER waste my money there ever again.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Cant tell you how many years my family and i have been enjoying the food here. The meat market has the best Asada for grilling.  Good to see mom and pop shops still thriving in the HD.  Recommend the hand made tortilla tacos!<//text>

I use to come to El Torito Restaurant years ago, today i decided to go for lunch. I see they haven't lost there touch on their delicious tacos, today is taco Tuesday. I had 2 beef, 1 pork tacos and small drink that's all it took to fill me up. Thanks El Torito!</Review>

Owner was rude to me when I asked her for Pico de gallo for my “machaca” burrito, which by the way is most definitely not machaca at all...It’s ground carne asada. This is false advertisement to say the least. And when I walked up to the register to pay for my Pico de Gallo, the guy was like,” we don’t charge for salsa.” Go figure lady making my food was just being a greedy...

El burrito de machaca no es de machaca, es de carne molida. Y también me cobraron por picó de gallo aunque no cobran normalmente.< /Text>

This was the 2nd time that I have been here. I love this meat market.

I've never tried their take out so I can't comment on that but everything is always so fresh. The salsa is incredible and they have 3 different types. Highly recommend if you want authentic.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) On December 4 I visited this place for the first time, I asked for a pozole, the service is good, the food is delicious, a really good pozole and in regards to the services. Additional you have to have how napkins very well. But when using the bathroom. There was no toilet paper which is annoying that due service is not available. The only thing I can say is that you have to be careful with that .. Why any place that provides restaurant service is essential that you have all the service for the community ... Thank you.

El pasado 4 de diciembre visité este lugar por primera vez un pedí un pozole   el servicio es bueno la comida es deliciosa un pozole realmente  bueno y en lo que respecta a los servicios. Adicionales que se tienen que tener cómo servilletas muy bien. Pero al usar  el baño. No había papel higiénico lo cual es molesto que no se cuente con el debido servicio.. Lo único que puedo decir es que se tiene que tener cuidado con eso.. Por qué cualquier lugar que preste servicio de restaurante es indispensable que cuente con todo servicio para la comunidad... Gracias.

(Translated by Google) The truth is that the cook leaves a lot to be desired with her attitude when preparing the client's food

The food is amazing I am traveling for work and stop by very lucky to find such good home cooked food! The El Grande asada burrito is the bomb. Always scared to see return customers and have a friendly relationship with the owner here. A multiple people coming through picking up phone orders.<//Review>

<Review>This is a small place with a couple tables. Order at the counter from the overhead menu. Counter person was efficient and friendly. Service was timely with the fresh cooked order. Our tacos and burritos were  just right. Beer is available along with sodas etc. Outside table for Covid. You can also order ahead for quick pickup and Doordash delivery.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Had the El Ranchero burrito with steak. I little heavy on beans/sour cream/salsa that made it a little messy, but overall very good. With a drink it was under $10 so it's a pretty good deal too.

Bumping this to 5 stars. The fresh burrito without sour cream was even better somehow. Great homemade taste and friendly service. My only complaint is charging for soda refills when dining in and no chips/salsa bar but I'm sure that's what keeps the prices so low. Definitely worth trying.</Text>

The service was great and friendly with a quite atmosphere. The food (enchiladas breakfast) was not to spicy and the hash browns was just  right. I'll be back to treat myself again☆< /review>

The gentleman who took my order offered many other items that weren't on the menu.  I ordered Chile Verde, which is not on the menu, and it was great.  The place itself is small with only a few tables to sit at, but I'd highly recommend it for take-out.  Probably the best burrito I've had in Ventura.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Delicious, authentic Mexican food for a reasonable price.  Everyone was very friendly behind the counter.  The gentleman who took my order offered many other items that weren't on the menu.  I ordered Chile Verde, which is not on the menu, and it was great.  The place itself is small with only a few tables to sit at, but I'd highly recommend it for take-out.  Probably the best burrito I've had in Ventura.<//Review>

The tacos are very small. But the salsas are pretty good. Then he had to kick us out because he had to make a delivery and didn't have any other staff to keep the place open.
Pricey for cheap food, bland, poor customer service, no free refills. Not going ever again.< /review>< pics>

Friendly dude at front, took our order and brought us our food. No misunderstanding in the order (one does not like onions). Nice typical Mexican ambience nothing too American. No beer girl cardboards which is a plus and had some TVs. Ordered 2 El Ranchero burritos and they were bomb. Even came with guacamole and sour cream inside. Came with chips and side of salsa (customer choice on type I believe). Chips are great and Verde salsa was amazing. Made a great first impression. Will be back for tacos next time.< /Review>

A Co-worker and I decided to give this place a try on our lunch break, I ordered a Ranchero Burrito with no meat- the lady at the register asked if I wanted no beans? Not sure where she got that, I corrected her and assumed she got my order in the way I explained it.
About 30 minutes had gone by and we still hadn't gotten our food, though other people who had come in long after had. I had to approach the counter and ask if they had forgotten about us- they had. The lady behind the counter didn't seem to care and didn't offer an apology or even some chips for us to munch on while we waited for more than 45 minutes now.
When my burrito finally came, it was just rice- nothing else?! Not what I had ordered AT ALL, plus the TO GO item I had ordered was wrong as well. My friends burrito was missing guac and cheese, so her order was wrong too.
I ended up getting back to work late because it took so long and spent the rest of the afternoon hungry because I only took a few bites of the "rice" burrito I was charged $10.00 for.</text>

1. Pork Burrito : It was freshly made in front of me so it took a couple of minutes to get ready.  The burrito was bland and nothing special.  The owner was very friendly, also the chicken here is the dark leg meat.<//text>

<Review>Probably my favorite bar on the planet. This bar is cash only, lots of fun, good service, and a killer view of the ocean just outside. Also, it’s dog friendly which is awesome. Every time I’m in Mendocino, I come here for some drinks and music. I love it here.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB7p9O0OzRSkKK0xeOG2rbZDhTL3bUjB7D5r-N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTFWiCSBSbOaOybYi6_3c_SCXq0jKQFHKANI7Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP30Nwj41yMAOQPNNUe-KGjALahWUteVV8cRKGd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJL96hY83a3AcBEItbOhjx76QaOiNpXJRw-Cm7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuzUVVMN6srHSYz5f0Z5zBQSMKOexWGmjxAZyh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Awesome local bar, not fair to call a Dive...but close. Good darts, and a small outside patio.
Don't miss this spot!!< /Text>

< Review>
My wife found this on some list as the Dive Bar wth the best view in the US, so naturally we had to grab a drink here while in Mendocino.  Definitely lives up to that reputation, great view facing south over the bluffs.  Friendly staff with fairly stiff drinks.  Pretty cool local vibe here, definitely not many tourists like us ventured in.  They have an awesome miniature model of the bar that is stunningly accurate.  Lots of great historical photos on the walls. Definitely the best place in town to grab a drink.<//Review>

This is a small unique bar with fun decor by the sea in Mendocino. It's a hangout spot for the locals. For your entertainment they have darts in the back room, an old fashioned jukebox, and large screen TV playing sports channels. The beer selection is decent and the staff is friendly.</Review>

<Review>Usually golden valleys are so frustrating but this location has been great. They’re super understanding, work to accommodate your needs and really care about your health and well being.

It was my first time at the Tenaya location. Everything was clean. They had implemented safe Covid protocols. Staff was pleasant and compassionate. And the doctor was my favorite part of it all. He took the time to sit with us and discuss things with us. I did not feel that he was rushed. And I felt that my daughter was seen! he truly acknowledged her and we both felt like he cared.</Text>

Make you wake till you are the last one even though you were there before other patients. It is better to do phone visits than in person.<//Text>

From the staff up front that gets you registered with kindness tied in with speediness and efficiency. Same goes with the nurses and doctors in the back. I was asked if I was thirsty. Next thing I know Im brought bags of crackers, bottles of water and Gatorade. Thinking to myself "Oh Boy, this could mean i may be here for hours". Nope 20 minutes later im out the door.

Very friendly staff and doctor- clinic very clean as well! Overall appt took about 2 hrs for a well baby check- which is on the long side. My only complaint is that the staff and doctor used hand sanitizer on their gloves , rather than removing and getting new ones! That is a big No no since you can’t sanitize exam gloves. Other than that I was impressed with the clinic on Tenaya in Modesto.< /text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I LOVE my doctor! But these phone appointments are a BIG disappointment to me 😞... I don't see how I can be properly diagnosed over the phone. Especially when I'm thinking I have either a bladder infection or a kidney infection. You don't treat them with the same medication and I'm allergic to so many different medications it's not even funny. SMH... plus I've had various ailments that has gone untreated because of the time limit allowed on a phone appointment and plus you're just so impersonal<//Text>< pics>

<user_name>Micaela Quintero< /user_name><Date>1583775718474< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>I made an appointment on a Saturday because I work during the week. My appointment was at 3:30, I arrived early in order to fill out paperwork since it was her first visit with this doctor. We went back and the MA checked her in and did her vision and hearing test and vitals. We then went in the room and she kept coming back asking more questions that I had already answered on all the papers I filled out. Then we wait and wait, it’s over an hour at this point. My 4 year old is getting antsy. And I step out into the hallway to ask if the doctor is coming, she informs me that we’re next but he had emergency patients that had to be looked at. I understand some emergencies happen, but what was the point of me booking an appointment if I had to wait over an hour? When the doctor came in it took 5 minutes, he signed her physical and that was it. It was almost 5 pm at that point. Maybe schedule things better so patients aren’t waiting that long!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>Hands down this is the best Golden Valley I’ve ever been to. Everything from the support staff, the nurse practitioner and the facility were great - attentive, detail oriented and clean and comfortable. My nurse practitioner actually took the time to review my records and was knowledgeable about my past medical issues. I was very impressed because most Golden Valley centers - especially the one I transverse from - barely give you the time of day. Not the Tenaya location. I was referred, scheduled for other various tests and screenings and out of there in less than an hour. And I left feeling that they really care about my health.
Thank you!< /Text>< pictures>

The Tenaya location has great customer service and always assists me well with concerns or questions I have.  The office appears to be well organized and my wait time is always low. The staff is friendly and makes going to that location comfortable.

Golden valleys phone system definitely needs some improvement though.  I can't contact my office directly it's a 1 800 number you call which makes getting in contact with your specific office a problem.  Getting my medicines filled also takes a while.<//review>

<review>This was our first time at this office and it was horrible. My appointment was at 8 am., Because I couldn't find the place I was 5 min late, so when I checked in they literally moved my appointment behind the 8:30 appointments. My appointment as I said before was at 8 am. We were seen at 9:45. I told the medical assistant my daughter had a speech for secretary at 8:45, she didn't acknowledge this. My daughter missed her speech at school. Very unprofessional..</review><userid>111105333096980491686< /userid>< gmap_id>

<rating>1</rating><review>I came in to get one of my sibling's tests checked  at the Tenaya location in Modesto, and it was not a pleasant experience. The clerk in the front acted as if she did not want to help us at all. Her name was Connie. She assumed that I was underage and asked if there was a parent present. When I told her that I was watching my siblings because my parents were out of town, she sighed and acted as if it was a burden to help us. I don't know if it was a racial thing because we are Indian and she's Hispanic or if she thought we were just there to give her (Connie) a hard time. I work in health care also, and I would not be treating anyone as if they were lower than me, especially when it comes to Medical services. There was also a trainee there, I don't know if she was supposed to show him "how it's handled," but it was not at all professional. I will not be coming back here. I was shown that racial discrimination is present, and I was shown what not to do while working in a medical facility.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>I don't know how GVH use to be but from my own personal experience, there awesome. The last couple of years I have bounced from doctor to doctor each shuffling patients like cattle without a glimpse of looking like they care. I've been going to GVH for 5 months now and it's a welcoming change. It took a little longer than I expected to get my first appt. but since then my appointment time have been perfect for my schedule. I was in there the other day for one thing and ask if they had an opening in the next week and sure enough just days later I'm going to the doctor. They answered everyone of my concerns and did multiple test for my symptoms. Referred me out to an RA that no other doctor would do. They listened to me. I couldn't be happier. Well we will see how long that last since now my doctor is no longer with GVH and I will be seeing a P.A. It's a guy and I can't stand male doctors. UGH!

I was hesitant to go here because we had a very rude doctor at the 6th street office who had the nerve to ask me to go into the room next door while my daughter stayed where she was and asked  "Are you even her mother?" referring to my daughter because I did not want to give her the flu shot at that time but informed him I would on the next visit scheduled two weeks later. He completely ridiculed me. I got my daughter and walked out.  Then they kept trying to bill me direct when they had all my insurance information and called them several times to clear it. 6 months later they did. DONT GO TO 6th Street!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The truth is that lately with that phone appointments they are losing interest in the health of the patients I understand that it is for safety but there are appointments that have to be seen in person, my daughter is very bad from the pressure I took my appointment and they gave it to me later from driving 30 min they told me your appointment will be by phone and they returned me 😡 as a daughter to the doctor to realize 👨‍⚕️ that I had high blood pressure also they are with yesterday it was my third time that the same thing happens to me I think they must differences between an appointment in person and one by phone I hope you take my comment into account

La verdad últimamente con eso de las citas por teléfono están perdiendo interés en la salud de los pacientes entiendo que es por seguridad pero hay citas que tienen que ser vistas en persona,yo hija muy mal de la presión saque mi cita u me la dieron después de manejar 30 min me dijeron tu cita va a ser por teléfono y me regresaron 😡 como hija a darse cuenta el doctor 👨‍⚕️ que llevaba la presión alta además son con ayer fue mi tercera vez que me pasa lo mismo creo que deben deferencias entre una cita en persona y una por teléfono espero que tomen en cuenta mi comentario</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>I had my order set for a later time to be picked up. unfortunately the time requested to pick up was no longer in my favor so I had called to see if I can have the cake done sooner and was very pleased that they were able to help me. The cake came out delicious And had no problem picking up my order.</review>< GmapID>

<text>This place has very photogenic desserts. Love taking pictures here. The desserts itself is quite  good. My favorite was the tiramisu, both of the tiramisu is really great. The place is self-service, I see a lot of Koreans at this place as it takes place in K-town. The place is pretty tight, but it seems okay.< /text><gmap_id>0x80c34d636101129d:0x7ae063d0a61356bf< /gmap_id><user_name>Andrew Dover</user_name></record>

< Review>
I hadn't been to this Baskin-Robbins in years, I used to go here quite a bit to order ice cream cakes and get ice cream, there have been a few different owners. At one time, I was told I couldn't park in front of the store in the empty parking lot, which I have heard has now changed. Although friendly staff is there, I think their policy about ice cream cake orders, in particular flavor changes is ridiculous. If you are paying for an ice cream cake, you should be able to pick the ice cream flavor since it has to be made. I was told I had to pay an additional fee for getting strawberry ice cream. How can you insist a person select from three different flavors only for Mother's Day cakes if they all have to be made?!<//Review>

Too pricey. $22 for a basic car wash? Clerk did not know what a wet vac was when I inquired over the phone. Won’t be going here!</Review>

I left this car wash for along time but decided to go back ( wrong choice ) last week I asked for the cheapest gas and the attendant , won’t mention names put in the higher price gas then gave me a dollar to make up the difference ( seriously know ) then charge me separately for each items as 4 dollar for tire dressing on wheels .  So today after church ( I tried to stay calm ) I pumped my own gas then went to the wash and asked for the 24.99 which is already outrageous as I had to vacuum the back seat of car , then I paid for my Honda as usual ( not a big car ) and looked at my receipt and they charge me a extra 2 dollars for oversize vehicle!! OMG seriously, I refused to pay that extra 2 dollars as they don’t do a great job anyway and will be calling corporate.
There very tricky at adding things on and the manager has no Customer service skills . I apologise for writing this as I don’t do reviews but this was the final straw

< review>
I have been going to this car wash location for many years, and this morning I thought I would take my truck to get washed rather than me doing it myself. When I arrived at the car wash the salesman convinced me to get my truck hand waxed with a car wash that included the inside and outside. Well to my disgust, the work was completed faster than normal which made me question the service rendered. To my surprise the car was washed very superficially with road grime still on the hood, grill, head lights and all over the truck. Inside the truck it was even worse, it was left with dust on most surfaces and the floor mats where left dirty. When they delivered the truck to me I started to point out the areas they had missed and the workers and their supervisor stated that they had done what the service required. I had them call over the salesman and they proceeded to clean a little more (still left sub-par). There was no apology for the sub-par work, in fact I got the feeling they had no regrets how they had treated me.  Also to my regret, I noticed some of the workers bad mouthing me in Spanish. To say the least, I am very disappointed with the service I was rendered.

I will not be using this place to clean my truck or cars any longer!</review>

<Review>They did a terrible job... $17.99 for a basic wash... They wrap it up in 10 min. Inside was still dirty and outside was nor much better... Don't waste your money, a gas station  automatic car wash would be the same...</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Got the detailing service and the backseat still had sticky spots. Other than that, great work.</Review>

<text>My first experience was decent. My second trip they talked me into upgrading to a hand wax and express detail service. $50 later the car was not clean inside or out. The inside wasn't even wiped down. I had to ask them to at least wipe down the dash. I live around the corner but I'll never go there again.<//text>< Rating>

I have been going to this car wash for several years and have been please with their job most of the time. However, when I went last weekend I was surprised to find out that they had raised their prices. At this point I think the price outweighs the service and I doubt I will be going there again future. I am very disappointed. 😩< /review>

Paid $40 for the special, but apparently that didn't include any sort of wiping down of the interior. They said it did, but I still have dust all over the dash and interior of my car.

The door panels are still dirty where shoes have left marks from getting in and out, so besides that and the layer of dust on the dash, radio and cluster, what I really got was a vacuum and exterior wash. The $12 hand wash, basically for $40.

The car's outside looks great, so I'll go back for the hand wash, but forget paying for any sort of interior wipe down. Should have stuck to the reviews, but of course I tried to give it a chance. So disappointed!!< /text>

This experience was bad. Do not go to this establishment. I went in for a car wash. The guy talked me into a mini detail with many promises they did not keep. They did not touch the inside, only vaccuumed and not very well. They left the car dirty with streaks and dirt on sides and inside truck bed. When I spoke with Wess, the owner or manager, he argued with me. I said do not offer a service if you cannot do what you promise. This is no way to run a business. All I wanted was a car wash. I did not ask to be lied to and taken advantage of.<//Text>

<Review>This place is delicious. I really enjoyed how you can customize your sushi burrito and add as many sauces as you want. They have friendly workers and good drinks. Highly recommend to anyone that likes Japanese fusion.</Review></record>

The staff were extremely friendly.  The food was unique and good.  It is a small business but everyone working there seems enthusiastic about the future.  Overall,  I enjoyed it.</Text>

Delicious spot for modern sushi dishes! Sushi wraps, bowls, and even fries with fish eggs. Everything we have tried has been really good. Recommend if you're a sushi lover.< /review>

I'm not sure what everyone was raving about. I didn't even eat my overly priced crap wrap. Service was weak and my boyfriend and I were greeted as hey ladies . Uhhhhh okay obviously they were super unconscious to who they were serving and what they were even serving. The lady couldn't describe to me nicely that they have two wasabi and even what the difference was. My boyfriend literally struggled finishing his food. Can't say we will ever come back. Came here for sushi and they don't have sushi only crap wraps and other crap in bowls .< /text>

Bigger space, many more tables.  Love those Ponzu fries, roasted steak cut fries with three great dipping sauces--their garlic aoli can't be beat. Sadly this location doesn't have a parking lot, on street parking on Canon Perdido is 15 minutes, but nearby streets are 75 minutes. They are now a very short walk from State Street.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80e91524529a31ed:0x256c11d02ea4cd6e< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Highly-rated restaurants in the area! I came here just a week ago to check out your bestselling recipes. With their food and service, I was so happy. I thanked the waiter for quickly serving my order. The place was so classy and romantic, and it impressed me. Five stars, people, for you! Highly suggested to everyone!</review>< time>

<Review>I enjoyed a pastrami sandwich and fries from the beloved aged establishment. The staff is friendly, quick and efficient. I give Langer’s 3 stars due to the bread not being toasted, something I believe every classic pastrami sandwich should have. The fries weren’t seasoned and perhaps steak fries could be a better fit for a deli setting. They were out of ice cream, so I couldn’t try a malt. I can tell this place was a hit back in the day. It’s not a favorite but added to my list due to the lack of deli culture in Los Angeles. Still worth a try 😉< /Review></record>

We ordered the top 2 sandwiches, I think 19 and 88? It’s definitely pricey, but the pastrami sandwich with the cole slaw was delicious. The sauerkraut one was a bit too salty for my taste.  $25 per sandwich is a bit steep, but you pay for quality.  Both sandwiches had good weight to them, though. Staff were friendly. I think we waited around 15mins. I’d come back.< /review>

<text>One of the finest restaurants I've had here in my city
No long wait to see the arrival of the ordered food. Everything that I ordered tasted perfect and great compared to other restaurants I've been to before.
I really enjoy dining in this kind of restaurant over and over again.< /text>< Pics>

I love the diner feel of the booths in the restaurant. The sandwich arrives and the smells that come from it are heavenly. It’s the best combination of bread, meat and cheese.<//text>

Admirable restaurant food quality. I ordered chicken and fried beef. In mere minutes, the waiter immediately responded to my orders. It was completely stunning and breathtaking. It made my heart melt! Profoundly recommended an excellent lunch for meetings with friends as well as supplying. The most splendid restaurant to visit. '5' stars all the way!< /text>

I've only ever ordered takeout from Langer's three times, and it has been fabulous every time! I've always ordered the #19 on rye which is DREAMY!!! Truly an American Classic! I can't wait to sit down and eat in the restaurant!< /review>

The food was delicious even though it’s a bit expensive, but it’s worth it with the view of the place while eating. I greatly loved the ambiance here. It was quiet, clean, and refreshing. Besides, I loved the staff so much. It was truly nice to be here at your restaurant. Honestly, it was satisfying and worth it. Good place, Good food!<//Review>

<Review>Best pastrami in LA, 100%

I have a small thing: every time when I need to cheer myself up I'll order something in Langer's.

Yesterday we grabbed Pastrami Sandwiches and Pastrami on Rye. As usual, it was amazing and tasty. All products are totally fresh and organic.

Definitely you'd try it yourself.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The hype is real, I've been to those places in New York., this place is awesome.  Comparing langer's to the ones in NYC is like comparing apples to oranges and you love them both.  Got the #19 and it deserves all the hype.  Dine in isn't open yet but they said it's opening June 15th.  Can't wait to go back and dine inside.</text>

<review>They run a tight ship. Maximum anti-covid protocol keeping everyone safe. The food is delicious, best pastrami in town. However; it's very pricey, but you get what you pay for. Once we're all back in the restaurant the price won't be painless but the ambiance will be worth it.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Another comfortable and relaxed weekend dinner in this restaurant! The food was delicious, and we ordered the spicy garlic shrimp again, love it! I can tell that the staff here are very kind, accommodating, and knowledgeable. I will recommend this restaurant to all of my friends, and we will see you again soon.< /text>

We went here while on vacation and honestly I was just kind of disappointed. The fries were alright, but had almost no seasoning. My boyfriend got the pastrami which was really good, but the crust on the bread was so hard, that part was inedible. I also got a grilled chicken sandwich which was horrible. No seasoning, extremely tough, and super messy. Not to mention we paid around $60 for all of that.... I know they are well known for pastrami, but if you’re going to sell other things in the menu, make sure they taste good. The chicken sandwich literally made me gag...</Text>

I HAD ORDERED THE NUMBER 88, WHICH IS A CORNED BEEF REUBEN AND WHEN I GOT HOME AND OPENED IT UP I SAW A SOGGY MESS. CURIOUSLY I OPEN THE SANDWICH TO FIND NO MORE THAN 9 PIECES OF CORNED BEEF ON MY $24 AND CHANGE SANDWICH. IT WAS A PILE OF SLOP THAT I WOULD NOT EVEN FEED TO MY CAT! I LIVE CLOSE BY TO LANGER'S AND I WILL NOT BE RETURNING THERE THIS IS MY SECOND BAD EXPERIENCE IN THE YEAR THAT I'VE LIVED IN THIS VICINITY! THEY OFFERED ME NOT A REFUND, WHICH I DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE OFFERED THEY OFFERED TO GIVE ME A SANDWICH AT HALF PRICE THE NEXT TIME I CAME IN FOR ANOTHER REUBEN, A NUMBER 88, THAT BEING SAID I SPOKE WITH A MANAGER WHO HAD TOLD ME THAT AND I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE OWNER WHO WAS THERE AND HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE DONE, HE COULD NOT SPEAK TO ME HE WAS BUSY WITH SOMEONE ELSE THAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY THE MANAGER, I SAID NO THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH! AGAIN,  NOT ONLY WILL I NOT BE RETURNING I WILL MAKE SURE PEOPLE I KNOW AND PEOPLE WHO WORK DOWNTOWN WHO GO THERE FOR DELI ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I WILL POST THIS ON YELP AND FINALLY I WILL BE CALLING CHANNEL 7 BE ON YOUR SIDE TEAM AND CHANNEL 2 NEWS INVESTIGATORS, THAT'S A VERY BAD WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS AND I DON'T CARE THAT HE'S OWNED IT FOR 60 PLUS YEARS, YOU TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND THAT THEY FAILED TO DO MISERABLY!<//Text>

Unfortunately, the quality of my sandwich was not what I have been accustomed to. The normally lean Delicious pastrami meat had a lot of fat. I ended up only eating half of my sandwich. The fries were awesome though!< /Review>

Dang was this place good. At the time of this review my pastrami sandwich with Swiss cheese was ~22$ which was more expensive then other places. My bread didn’t come toasted so make sure you ask if you want it toasted.</Review>

Unfortunately we had to stand outside and order, due to the pandemic. I learned they have curbside service as well. I decided to try the specialty, a hot pastrami sandwich. It was delicious! It was different from anything I've ever had as the pastrami was thick. Mustard and rye bread accentuated it. Highly recommend.</text>

A fine restaurant in every Department. One can expect to be  treated special by a great, upbeat attentive staff. I had experienced some very fine customer service and i complimented the Manager. He replied to  me that he never wants any customer  to leave unhappy and i myself adapted that as my mantra. The quality and freshness of the food and bakery are awesome  and i am very happy that you are providing a great service for that area. Thank you</review>

<Text>This place has a dynamic pastrami sandwich with more expensive cuts of meat. Very delicious and filling. Very crowded and parking is not easy in this neck of the woods but the pastrami sandwich is worth the hassle. Thick cuts of pastrami, fat marbled on the edges...it is something out of this world.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I understand this place is famous.. For me it's just alright.. The service was very good.. But the prices are on the upscale for just an old diner. Although the food was pretty good..would i go again? Not if i was paying..cause it's pricy.< /Text>

I’ve been here a couple of times and it never disappoints. The pastrami sandwich is so delicious! Best pastrami I’ve ever had. The staff is friendly and it’s pretty busy most of the time! But definitely worth it.< /text>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Unfortunately we had to stand outside and order, due to the pandemic. I learned they have curbside service as well. I decided to try the specialty, a hot pastrami sandwich. It was delicious! It was different from anything I've ever had as the pastrami was thick. Mustard and rye bread accentuated it. Highly recommend.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>This is by far the best deli in LA. The pastrami and corned beef sandwiches are to die for. Lots of delicious meat cut by hand on double baked rye bread. Heaven! Huge portions, great, quick service. Reasonable prices.

Pastrami hot sandwich is bomb. Their roast beef with the auju sauce is so so good. The meat has great flavor, the bread and sauce complement it 😋 Try it!< /Text>

Each time I travel to LA, I arrange portions of my trip around ordering the #19 from Langer’s. The sandwich has received so much press but it is not overhyped, it is worthy of all the accolades. I love the diner feel of the booths in the restaurant. The sandwich arrives and the smells that come from it are heavenly. It’s the best combination of bread, meat and cheese. Of course they sell lots of sandwiches, but the #19 is iconic.</text>

Also, the curb-side service is uncoordinated most days. So, you're better off hoppin out & going inside to pay for your food< /Text>< pictures>

Awesome hot pastrami sandwich. They are known for the famous #19 and it did not disappoint. Waitresses and waiters were all very helpful and attentive.<//review>

<text>I would recommend this place! They have super friendly and professional barbers! My husband got a hair cut and a beard trim here. It was all well done by John the best barber we chose. He felt so handsome after the cut. We would definitely choose this barbershop again in the future due to their excellent service.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Old-school Deli with wide variety and huge portion size. Valued meal and good services. We ordered Ruben, Tuna Sandwich and knish. Apparently we over did it. The food was good. Personally I like Katz's Deli style better.<//review>

You are the best among the rest! I like your restaurant because of the dishes and staves. The place is so perfect for those who love the elegant and classy ambiance. I thanked the waitress for serving my order immediately. I couldn't ask for more from you, guys! You are strongly recommended to everyone!<//Text>

Item number 44 the hand-cut hot pastrami, nippy cheese and sauerkraut grilled on double baked rye is essentially a Reuben. It is big enough to share. The only disappointment was the pickles have very little flavor.</text>

<username>Stephen Valentino</username><Time>1550880482381< /Time><rate>5<//rate><Text>An excellent Jewish delicatessen in the downtown area of Los Angeles. The food is simply wonderful. It is indeed a little on the pricey side but they are renowned for their house made corned beef and pastrami. There is usually a wait but the food is well worth the wait. The service is pretty good and overall I would certainly recommend this Delicatessen.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLDxx0g81b-3RTlCV012UBx4cuPCeT9VFnnR5i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Today was my first time trying Langer's. We shared a hot pastrami with sauerkraut and chili cheese fries. The fries arrived incredibly hot and stayed that way till the last one. The pastrami is so tasty and superb in quality. The service was great and food arrived quickly. The prices are steep, but come and share something, because the taste is worth it!< /review>

I  wont lie... the food is delicious but pricey... but i believe in paying for quality- so its all good. 4 & not 5 bcuz twice i had 2 different girls get impatient & get attitudes when i was making my phone orders.

Also, the curb-side service is uncoordinated most days. So, you're better off hoppin out & going inside to pay for your food<//Text>

I visited this place because I saw it on California's Gold. It was DELICIOUS! Just super pricey, but goodness, it was worth it! I got a pastrami with coleslaw on it & pepper jack in lieu of Swiss. Parking situation wasnt ideal, but there is a lot of 7th & Westlake & parking gets validated.<//text>

<Text>Langer's Deli is a culinary icon of Los Angeles, and they serve one of the best hot pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. The #19 comes with hand-cut thick slices of pastrami, a perfect ratio of cooling coleslaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese, all sandwiched between rye bread. It's a perfect balance of flavors, textures, and temperatures in your mouth all at the same time. Must-eat for any food lover in or visiting LA.< /Text><response>None<//response><UserId.>110950550742251900040< /UserId.><rating>5<//rating>< Pics>

<Review>This restaurant offers not only good and best-tasting food but also the best ambiance than any other restaurant in the area. They had a dining area outside where you can eat and dine under the trees. We ordered a lamb and vegetable platter, and it was undeniably delicious! We had so much fun! The best Ethiopian restaurant in the city!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Pretty decent for pastrami sandwiches. Claims for being better than Katz deli NY definitely not and I'm from San Francisco so there's no bias. The bread is soggy. They definitely need better bread. The meat was good, but definitely missing something.< /Review>< pics>

Cannot fault folks for pandemic and lack of dine in service but awful curb side business customer service is lacking. However, my real issue is the food. The quality gets worse with each visit. These $20 plus sandwiches are filled with kraut and toppings, lack of meat. Corned beef and pastrami tender but no ones pays this money for bread and condiment sandwiches. I spoke with manager prior to Covid but servings have gotten worse since. I will admit people come from every direction for authentic deli food. But it is such a disappointment to drive 45 minutes and pay over $50 for 2 sandwiches and 1 order of fries for basically bread!  Where is the meat? Have to give customers what they are paying for not condiments and fluff. Way too expensive for quality and quantity!!< /Review></record>

<Text>Food and pricing here are great. The waiters are nice and try their best to give you a nice experience. The place seems to be popular for local family gatherings. I mean food servings are just enough. Everything is really good. It was kind of a large area and mellow music. I hope they will offer unlimited rice too. Thank you very much!<//Text>< rating>

<rating>4<//rating><text>The establishment itself is well maintained and clean, but it is located in a ungentrified part of LA. It reminded me of Mexico, where there are a lot of street vendors selling drinks and food on about every street corner.  I'm not usually in this part of town so I can't speak about how it really is on the day to day. I came with my boyfriend to get their famous pastrami sandwich and that was well worth the trip. Only thing to look out for is that the Langer's parking lot is for employees only. We came when they opened so no one was in the booth in the parking lot. There is metered parking on the street which is free on Sundays.</text>< pics>

<Text>Where do I begin. This place has a great chill vibe, and it is nice and clean. I ordered the #19 and boy did it knock my socks off! The pastrami was super flavorful and thick, it looks and taste absolutely delicious. It is a bit pricy, hovering around the $23 mark after tip but worth it. Treat yourself to one of their #19. You will not regret it. Highly recommended.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKJ4PFX9olnJc_POhxFOX3-fFwDHmQDJhWd6Ky=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrI7aYIH01rr-EEuTyKCIha4tYosrEw4GcGWU1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><GmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501<//GmapID>< UserId.>

I brought my family to this place many times a year! This is the best place to have a good dinner. The cooking is of high quality, you could really have many orders instead of having a limited order. The food is really yummy! The team is friendly and the payment is affordable. I enjoyed being in this restaurant over a decent lunch. I will be recommending this place to everyone.< /Text>

Tl;dr : Go early (or order for curbside) & go hungry.

I can only compare this LA institution to others such as Katz' NYC and Harold's in New Jersey... Langer's punches its weight.
Sandwiches are smaller than the monsters served at the east coast meccas (but still generous). Pickles and mustard are milder.
Crowds are better-managed and the rye bread is surprisingly superior.
We had the #19 (pastrami with slaw and Russian dressing on rye) and shared some fries. No one left hungry.< /review>

This was my first time coming to Langers. I came early with a friend to miss the the lines that form outside, but even when we left there was still not a line on the Friday we ate there.  I got a club sandwich that came with turkey and tongue and beef, but I substituted bacon for the beef. It was excellent.  So big I had to take half of it home.  Definitely not inexpensive - $22 for sandwich. But I don't think there is anywhere else in Los Angeles that you can get a club sandwich with tongue! 😀 My friend and I split an order of fries, which were very good. She had a pastrami sandwich with a cheese called nippy.  She was very happy with her sandwich. I will definitely try to make it across town again to have lunch there.</review>

Way overpriced for a sandwhich.$23.00 for a sandwhich that has half of the meat other deli's offer. Paid additional $3.50 for extra lean corn beef, there was visable fat in the sandwiches. Better off with Brent's, Canters, or anywhere else.This place is overrated. I don't understand why people frequent this place, when there are far superior delis in L.A<//Review>

The pastrami is flavourful and rye bread is nice as well. The crust is crunchy, giving the sandwich a nice texture. The inside is soft, warm, and packed with goodies. It is not filled up like Katz (if that's what you are looking to compare) but I did not feel the lack of meatiness.

I got number 19 and coselaw was good, not sure if I would get it cheese again. The Russian dressing made it different and I got what was looking for (slightly sweet and rich sauce vs. just mustard).

Overall I would recommend it, the size is good to share. I will definitely be back for their other dishes.

PS. I tried their chopped liver. The flavor was intense and tasted too rich for me (very heavy seasoning of garlic and onions). You can definitely taste the liver though, but other spicing overwhelmed it.<//Review>

Two words....corned beef and pastrami.  Here is one of LA few remaining institutions that should be on your bucket list.  If you like either of the two then this establishment is 5 stars for any sandwich made with any one of those meats. They still do it the old way with hand cut meats and real rye bread.  The only reason why it's 4 stars is due to the NY pricing often which this establishment is compared to, but even with the high cost of a sandwich I still go back once a month.  Pro tip....call in your order for curbside pickup.<//Text>

Langer's Deli is a culinary icon of Los Angeles, and they serve one of the best hot pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. The #19 comes with hand-cut thick slices of pastrami, a perfect ratio of cooling coleslaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese, all sandwiched between rye bread. It's a perfect balance of flavors, textures, and temperatures in your mouth all at the same time. Must-eat for any food lover in or visiting LA.< /review>

The pickles came on the side a whole one, cut in half, in a lil bag, that was not ideal, for eating in a car. There was no dine in. Over priced.

The pasta here is so different and delicious. You can choose your own pasta, meat and sauce so there are countless options to select from. Being a vegetarian I opted for the Gnocchi with Funghi Mushroom sauce. It was super super heavy but it was heaven.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501<//gmapID>< Time>

Personal preferences..I switched the cheese to Pepperjack cheese and ordered it toasted..came out completely delicious. Juicy coleslaw, well toasted and tasty Rye (I never liked the taste of Rye but this one is great!) And adding a bit of brown mustard to the Pastrami just makes this Huge sandwich hit the spot nicely. I came with an empty stomach but only had half the sandwich, will enjoy second half later. Also comes with a side of pickle.

Was also able to enjoy Pastrami Chili cheese fries with a table of 5. It was a great portion and fries are crinkled with the right balance of chili cheese that doesnt make it to sloppy or heavy. Extra pastrami never hurts, some of the best I tasted in LA.

Parking is a bit hard around this area so I lyfted over with a couple friends and line goes by quickly, very organized and structured with their seating system. Great and friendly service who always kept my water   refilled to the top of the glass despite being busy lunchtime. Would recommend and return!< /Text>< userid>

<review>First time here, life long LA resident. I hate when a place gets hyped up on how good it is just because it's been there since the beginning of time. That being said, I can tell you this place did not let me down!  This has been by far the best pastrami I've had so far and I can't even remember what would be second to this.  It's tender, flavorful and the sweet tang from the Russian Dressing is fantastic.  I came in at 9am on a Tuesday, so it wasn't jam packed like it usually is so I got seated right away. Our server, Sheila, was such a sweet lady and made my daughter smile. Their hours are 8-4pm, so unless you work in the area, you'll have to take the day off to go here.... which is very worth the time.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQb7YDcRaVw4Zq2RqfeqRMr0WWupkfifQg32RK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDtY6qhWBa6wB46pUYBIUUSCzIyTY-_6KFXDDF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZNhTjYg0zHf6rUvvAuLYrGMKeGddI3U1EV8p_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

If you want Pastrami in Los Angeles and a taste of heaven.. Go to Langer's. Also awesome 90 min parking free with validation. The area is busy and no parking.  Don't believe me.

OMG I never knew pastrami could taste this good! LoL. I love the old feel of this place. We ordered the #19 I think (it's one of their more popular sandwiches) It comes with pastrami, coleslaw, cheese, and , Russian dressing and we also ordered the pastrami fries. The pastrami is literally melt on your mouth good and the fries were great as well the only thing was that I felt like the chili was the brick chili and I dont really like that. Definately go on a cheat day! There is metered parking out front but it's best to just park in their lot and it's literally like a block down and a short walk back.</text>

Expensive but they serve big portions. You'll probably need a to go box. The Number 19 - Pastrami Sandwich was the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. The pastrami fries was delicious. 👍<//Text>

If you are coming for breakfast to Langer's I highly recommend the eggs and pastrami scramble. You also have a great selections of soups and other dishes. If you come on the weekend you will be waiting for a while. For a person who never likes waiting in lines for food. Langer's is the only place I will ever wait to eat.< /review>

<Text>Unbelievable menu, though I normally go for the No. 19 with corned beef rather than pastrami, Iove how they cut their meats thicker than most delis so you get the moist taste of the meats and of course their twice baked rye bread is phenomenal though I normally don't like rye bread. Great service, amazing food and Norm Langer has a magnificent legacy from his Dad.<//Text>< Pictures>

I think this restaurant has the best recovery foods after a tiring workout in the gym last year. They all have that I needed, especially for some grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. I really enjoyed it and kudos to the server that was able to attend to all of my requests cordially. A truly wonderful experience! Two-thumbs up!< /Text>

<Text>The food was delicious and the pastrami itself was the best pastrami meat I've ever had. I was quite shocked by the price though, $18.95 for just the sandwich and half pickle. I'm glad I went, but I will probably think twice about going back just because of the price.<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp><user>102137484390248054153<//user><name>Jeff Kermath< /name>< rating>

This restaurant is located on the shore with a beautiful view of the sea. The staff is friendly and very attentive. They offer a large variety of seafood, veggies, and some meat.  As a seafood lover, I was never disappointed with this restaurant has to offer. Beautiful atmosphere and a peaceful place to view. Highly recommended!</review>

It was very delicious, I took number 19.
It’s 4 stars as it did cost $22 for a sandwich. It was really good but I think it’s overpriced.< /review>

Pastrami is really good.  Number 19 with Swiss cheese is my favorite. Parking is a little complicated,  if you can take the red line do that instead. Chili cheese fries are really good too.<//Text>

The food is off the chain.  The best pastrami ever.  Tbe deaeet was great.  The fries and chili were just okay.  So why 4 stars , it is hella expensive.  It was 100$ for lunch before tip.  My advice go but share and be aware of the cost.  There is frew parking with validation up.the street.  My other advise, be prepared to.wait in line.  Other than that go and enjoy</Text>

My favorite is the # 19 - Pastrami on Rye. The 🍞 is soft on the inside & the outside crust is crunchy. It's piled high with meat & just enough Cole slaw to get the perfect mixture of both.<//Review>

<Review>The food was delicious. But the sandwiches almost twenty bucks. 18.75 18.95 something like that. I have to say this was a really small sandwich.REALLY SMALL.

I understand Norm. You run a union shop and there sure were a lot of people working there during this covid-19 lock down and I applaud you for that. Oh he responded back

Come on Norm. That Cheapskate Terry Bloomgarden puts more meat on a sandwich than this.</Review></record>

One of the only LA-area delis where a vegan could only eat pickles 💔 None of the usual veg-friendly stuff - bean salads, cucumber salads, nothing. All side salads are mayo-based. Pictured is what I got for ordering pickles. Staff at counter were nice, server couldn't be more annoyed. 😔</review>

The food was great! We enjoyed the chili garlic shrimp, which was served hot. Our servers Sofia and Alex, were excellent always there when we needed anything. There were plenty of chocolates, which I loved the most, and I was surprised about the room of cheese they had. We will come back and recommend the restaurant to my friends and family.< /Review>

<name>Shaun “KAMIKAZE” Kimura</name><Text>OMG! #19 and #54 19 style! So good and everything on these compliments each other. But you can still discern the the flavors from each other. You get the salty from the pastrami, the sweet and tangy from the coleslaw then the Russia sauce and a creamy kick to the rye bread. All this meld together to form a wonderful eat.</Text>< date>

This restaurant is a tiny place which could easily be missed but it serves one of the best pastas I have had in my life. The pasta here is so different and delicious. You can choose your own pasta, meat and sauce so there are countless options to select from. Being a vegetarian I opted for the Gnocchi with Funghi Mushroom sauce. It was super super heavy but it was heaven.< /review>

I think this restaurant has the best recovery foods after a tiring workout in the gym last year. They all have that I needed, especially for some grilled chicken with roasted vegetables. I really enjoyed it and kudos to the server that was able to attend to all of my requests cordially. A truly wonderful experience! Two-thumbs up!<//Text>

The rib-eye steaks here are the best! I was greatly satisfied with the taste of it, and even the services are really exceptional. I highly appreciate the waiter that attended to my orders because he was so polite and attentive. Indeed, the best place to eat out for romantic dates, family gatherings, and any other occasions.

One of the world’s great delis

I grew up in the New York metro area, and this reminds me of the great Brooklyn delis near my Nana

The pastrami and tongue were both spectacular.  The biggest standout is the rye bread - the best I’ve ever had

Wide selection of other Jewish classics like kasha, latkes, and blintzes</Review>

Their pastrami changes lives! 🤤

Literally can't go back to the more commonly found pastrami found at your run of the mill "Greasy Spoon" joints. Even for the price (practically a $20 sando) you will want to return to Langer's time and time again!< /Text>

Excellent Italian food in the Los Feliz neighborhood! This place is really really good, especially their gnocchi.... practically every review on yelp raves about their gnocchi so of course I had to try it. We had the gnocchi with mushroom sauce (best combination EVER). The moment you put the gnocchi in your mouth, you could feel the pillowly soft savory goodness! This place serves up the best gnocchi I have ever ever had! So if you come here, you have to at least try that.<//Review>

<Review>Pastrami is really good.  Number 19 with Swiss cheese is my favorite. Parking is a little complicated,  if you can take the red line do that instead. Chili cheese fries are really good too.<//Review>< Name>

Everything tastes good here. I've tried every single pasta dish they have here. Fresh ingredients. Very casual atmosphere. Desserts are also amazing.

The only problem I had here over the years is that one of the owners brother was very rude about something. But that doesn't change my rating for the restaurant. The food is good here.</review>

<review>It's a good spot if you're in the mood for some Korean barbecue. The meat options are good, and the sides, though limited in variety, are delicious! Also, the staff is very attentive once they know you are looking for, they won't hesitate to assist you even they are doing something. One of the best Korean restaurants that I've tried! I highly recommend this place!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I’m often tempted to order other items but I just go with the classic. The menu is extensive. The service is cheerful and fast. Everyone dining here is in a good mood because they know about and are eating great food. There is validated parking a block away but I’ve never bothered to find it. Maybe I will next time. But on this visit was able to get street parking with the meters. Bill for two for two sandwiches, malt shake and coffee was $60 all in.</review><Time>1582474610152< /Time>< rate>

<text>Terrific food and a cool atmosphere. I had the patty melt on sourdough (the best sourdough bread I've ever had) and my girl friend got the world famous #19. Both sandwiches were absolutely delicious. Potato pancakes and the fries were perfect also. The atmosphere is very homey, very comforting.<//text>< date>

I ate the world famous #19 pastrami sandwich. It was small and not delicious as recommended. And the price is over $18 and one soda is around $4. Comparing of a little bit high price, the whole quality of the sandwich is medium. Not go anymore.</Text>

< Review>
My NYC friend was in town again recently and could have knocked me over with a feather when he suggested going to Langer's: an LA institution!!
Why knock me over? because this is a dyed in the wool New Yorker who would usually make the ugly face when i suggested going to an LA deli. This dude was raised on Katz's and the Carnegie Deli food and whose parents spoon fed him rice pudding at those venerable joints.
In any event after i picked myself up off the floor we made the short trek to Alvarado very early one morning recently and ordered 2 of the famous number 19: Pastrami on Rye with Swiss and Slaw, side of Potato salad.
I have been going to Langer's for what seems like 100 years but in reality since the 1970's though i haven't been for about 10 years.
This is the type of place in which there are least a couple of veteran employees that will recognize you and one who asked me about my Pops who kicked the proverbial bucket 20 years ago!
I remember going with Pops on Saturday morning to eat fried eggs and toast and once in a while he would let me drink coffee. (this was a more innocent time when teens did not drink coffee for fear of "stunting" their growth!)
We stared, mouths agape when the 19's arrived at our counter space: this was a beautiful thing to behold. And ultimately a beautiful thing to eat:
super fresh, pillowy rye bread with a slightly crispy edge. Note: this is real old style rye made with a good percentage of rye flour and seeds.
The Pastrami here is supremely tender, slightly pickley, peppery, smoky with the appropriate amount of fat that tasted so fresh that i bet it had just come out of the smoker being that it was very early in the AM.
The Slaw added crunch and a piquant vinegar astringency to the sammy. The Swiss and their famous Russian dressing were along for the ride to smooth out the overall taste. There are a lot of things pulling at your taste buds screaming: Eat Me! Love Me! But it all comes together at the conclusion of every bite.
The Langer people are quick, super efficient and sassy and most have been here for many years. These are professional people who take their jobs seriously. And it shows.< /Review>

The chopped liver and herring in cream sauce was thrown in the garbage. I paid $43 today for crappie food and a bad attitude. They get two stars because their pastrami is still one of the best. Along with a pastrami sandwich I took home half pints of chopped liver, herring in cream sauce, cole slaw and a loaf of rye. The chopped liver has a mealy consistency, an odd flavor and probably full of filler. The herring is in a thin milky sauce, lacking the traditional thicker cream sauce and the fish is too fishy tasting. Its off on taste and texture. The deli man seemed  Inconvenienced by my order. My bad review won't make a dent in this businesses traffic flow, but as a lifelong deli consumer I hate to see one of the last great delis serve lousy food.< /review>

<review>Delicious. It's a small and intimate restaurant. Their food is good. I loved their  salads and squid ink  pasta with shrimp. They have a very nice selection of Italian wines and you can polish it with grappa at the end. Place is small so expect to be seating very close to other guests. They also have a nice outdoor seating which is nice during summer.</review><Response>None< /Response>< userid>

<rate>5</rate><review>Great restaurant in Los Angeles! Varied menu with great options for all palates and preferences, with a strong Hawaiian influence.  Nice ambiance inside as well, clean & simple interior, friendly and knowledgeable staff with great efficiency.  Good cocktails and wines by the glass, too. Really enjoyed it, definitely recommend.< /review></record>

The food is off the chain.  The best pastrami ever.  Tbe deaeet was great.  The fries and chili were just okay.  So why 4 stars , it is hella expensive.  It was 100$ for lunch before tip.  My advice go but share and be aware of the cost.  There is frew parking with validation up.the street.  My other advise, be prepared to.wait in line.  Other than that go and enjoy</review>

Folks, this is the real deal Jewish deli. If you love pastrami or corned beef or dozens of other related delicacies then here’s your spot. I had a hot pastrami with kraut and Swiss cheese. WOW delicious and what a huge sandwich. It was more than I could eat. Super friendly staff and quick service make this place a classic. Park in their lot (1 bloc o away) but don’t forget to get your ticket validated when you pay after dining.

Langers has been on my restaurant hit list for a  while. I had the opportunity to savor, perhaps  the best  French Dip pastramy and roast beef sandwiches in town. My family and I arrived on Sunday, an hour before closing. There was no waiting. my wife and daughter, being fans of cafe counters, quickly took our spot front center of the kitchen. Our waiter was friendly and very patient with us. Our dishes were served on a timely manner and  hot. We also had the opportunity to meet the owner who was very friendly and even gave my daughter free fries, because he said I was being greedy with my chili cheese fries 😁, I'll admitted, just a little. Then again, who wouldn't, they're so good! Overall, it was great experience that's defenitely worth repeating. Update, we have returned twice since my review, the hot pastrami sandwhich, accompany with sauerkraut on rye, is a must.</text>

<Review>So i heard this place was pretty good compared to howlin Ray's so I decided to try this place out since I didn't want to wait the ferocious line for howlin Ray's this time around.

I ordered half tender half slider and my bf got 2 sliders. I think I liked the slider better but dang it was so much fries and food next time I might get 1 combo with my bf and add an extra slider.

The fries were good I just wished they were a bit more hot (temperature). It came out kinda cold like it's been sitting out.</Review>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>My wife and I absolutely loved our experience at Langer's. Our server Gwen(pictured) was such a sweetheart!! Service was patient yet thorough. We were here because of Phil Rosenthal and his food shows on Netflix. It totally exceeded our expectations guys. The #19 sandwich was brilliant as advertised, the matzo ball soup was so savory, and the whip cream cake....OMG are you serious??? The cake alone was worth price of visit. Be smart and judiciously split items with family or friends to try more of menu. When you visit L.A. ; you must stop here. Gwen thanks for answering all of our questions. Amazing service.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUdx4ejZIA1cYBNUaoxitmFlkFteOzLF-hS6x3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy3iWgwQ7GdFcAEgfFAXuO6RkR4qAEoeec0sYk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn3xAiUSEXFeGzadclhHz-Kz8m-emjPqLCUHvh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnzMbph-tgl2kygHplk90gjfmG6nhXChaxQTup=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_4Rnweh8mKgaLofEpTvpyqCJ6f8ZzWb8S2exk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOePWJTfy1XW_tI5CT7nKu8-ieYITDxVzgrpuwF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2FMknqHvA2v9bHti9LWIKy5wZkqneTYsZ0Uov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9n2M1l8YEnGxnnRJPWK3yH_INaqhB247nLhxu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Nothing on the exterior tips you off to what you are about to experience. Years ago, this was Saint Germaine, but much has changed. The decor is subtler, emphasizing great ceiling height. Tables are decently apart. During the week, two private rooms are in use, but open on the weekends for more public traffic. Essentially, during the week, this is a small place.<//Review>

I visited this place because I saw it on California's Gold. It was DELICIOUS! Just super pricey, but goodness, it was worth it! I got a pastrami with coleslaw on it & pepper jack in lieu of Swiss. Parking situation wasnt ideal, but there is a lot of 7th & Westlake & parking gets validated.</review>

Look it’s all too often these days that the words world’s best gets bandied about. In this case however these words when applied to the #44 Pastrami Sandwich might actually be accurate. See photo for a realistic representation of the actual sandwich. Bottom line it was really good.<//text>

Nice small area, I love the outdoor seating. Service was great. I ordered the short rib. It was really rich and delicious, but hard to finish without some sort of starch. Had to knock one star off for that. Otherwise, great ambiance for a date or catching up with friends.< /review>

Every Los Angeles old timer loves and swears by this place. Still the best pastrami in town; thick and meaty.  An old school Jewish deli experience right over in Westlake; near Mac Arthur Park. The owners and staff are the nicest people.< /Review>

First visit on a Friday after one o'clock. Coffee was great, with a lot of options. Staff was friendly and efficient. Food was good. Service was a little slow, I think because the drive through was busy.< /Review>

Have to try this place in LA of you're a fan of cured meat like corned beef and pastrami. One or the best still after all these years? Though it's not cheap and it's located in a party of town that's not well kept.

The pastrami at LA farmers market was slightly better in my opinion.< /review>

<text>Best beef pastrimi sandwich I've ever had, period. The beef pastrami was cooked perfectly tender and goes extremely well with the bread, cheese and sauce. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and service was excellent as well, though more expensive than your typical diner.<//text>< Date>

Pastrami is the yummiest.  The meat is so tender and juicy with the right amount of fat.  Tried their pastrami chili cheese fries.   So good!  The #19 is the way to go if you're there for the pastrami sandwich.<//text>

As we choose carefully who we spend our money with these days it is important that companies treat their guest with respect. That wasn’t the case here. Restaurant is also located in sketchy neighborhood. Mostly like will not return.  Hostess was rude.< /Review>< username>

Always got the #19 to go but this this went inside and got table service.  Best pastrami and this place has been open  72 years.   I've been to Katz deli in New York too.  If you want Pastrami in Los Angeles and a taste of heaven.. Go to Langer's. Also awesome 90 min parking free with validation. The area is busy and no parking.  Don't believe me. Just eat and believe..<//review>

<review>Usually enjoyed dining in, but 2nd time I order curb side and disappointed again. Items missing/wrong.  Over half of corned beef was fat and potato pancakes drenched in oil and over seasoned with onion powder. One of the meals was also inedible. It was contaminated with pieces of plastic that looked like fish bones. expected higher quality service & food.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</Gmap_id>< response>

Update: In LOVE with their tongue sandwich!! $18ish. Of course this place is famous for pastrami

Any to go orders can park on 7th street. Someone will run out to you. They sell per lb.

Parking is on Westlake and 7th for minutes, validated by Langers.< /Text>

My favorite is the # 19 - Pastrami on Rye. The 🍞 is soft on the inside & the outside crust is crunchy. It's piled high with meat & just enough Cole slaw to get the perfect mixture of both.< /Review>

<Review>I think this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever eaten! I was seriously considering ordering another sandwich after I had my first one.
I like mine with just mustard and mayo, sliced red onion on rye bread. Their rye bread here is so good!<//Review>< Name>

<text>OMG! #19 and #54 19 style! So good and everything on these compliments each other. But you can still discern the the flavors from each other. You get the salty from the pastrami, the sweet and tangy from the coleslaw then the Russia sauce and a creamy kick to the rye bread. All this meld together to form a wonderful eat.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Wow! Love this place. I went to New York and on intentionally went to Katz and Carnegie's because I do love pastrami. But I have to tell you neither one of them holds a candle to Langer's. If you're in the area you have to try their sandwich. I personally don't like rye bread but they're famous for their number 19 which is a traditional pastrami sandwich on rye with coleslaw. I actually get the pastrami dip which I understand to some people may seem odd but it is the bee's knees. I love their au jus sauce so much I just drink it. Have fun.</text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

<Text>One of the best pastrami sandwiches i had so far! I tried the #19 which is their most popular, comes in rye bread and with cole slaw. I as well had the fries with chilli, cheese and pastrami and it was absolutely delicious. They have a great varierty of cold cuts and assorted menu. Cant wait to go back and try bagel with lox, capers, onions and cream cheese. Its pricey but very worth it and you get big quantity meals.<//Text>< pics>

We came here during DineLA week and the options they had for the special menu were excellent. We all got something different and I went with anything that had short rib. I'm a short rib fiend so I was excited there were so many options for it. Everything was tasty and service was wonderful. I'd be back for sure.</Text>

I spent 90 minutes on the road and spent $20.75 to buy 1 sandwich here - custom made pastrami, Mayo, and Muenster on a soft toasted French roll. Holy crud it was worth every penny and every minute. I planned on eating half and saving the other half, but one bite in, I realized that wasn't going to happen. The pastrami was rich, fatty, salty and just all around delicious. Curbside pickup was the right way to go. I just wished I was richer and they were closer to me. Treat yourself to quality.<//review>

This place has really gone down hill. Ordered the #54 sandwich - combo, corned beef and Pastrami. The pastrami was so fatty, it was almost inedible. I have been told before that "the fat is where the flavor is," but there is a fine line between flavorful fatty and so fatty that I'd rather eat something else. This crossed that line. Given the challenging hours, rough neighborhood, and difficulty finding parking, this may have been my last stop here.<//Text>

<text>I'm from Orange County and have a difficult time finding good Indian food in my area. I was passing through Beverly Hills and found this restaurant on Yelp. I'm glad that I stopped here because the food and service was outstanding and much better than I've found in OC. We had the saag panner, garlic basil naan, butter chicken, veggie korma, and basmati rice. All the dishes were delicious and the portions were just the right size. I particularly enjoyed the saag panner and vegetable korma. The service staff was very attentive and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant and we'll be back!< /text>< Pictures>

Delicious! Menu is small but that's what makes it great! Simple and tasty. We ordered the slider and chicken tenders both in hot and xtra hot. Next time we will try the reaper since the xtra hot was definitely tolerable. Not too hot at all. Clean place and great variety of music playing. It's not too big and some of the tables are tightly spaced. Walk-in and order and your food is literally ready within minutes! It's pretty fast-paced but again, delicious! We'll definitely be back!</Text>

The World's best Pastrami sandwich, hands down! Over 10 years ago I had this sandwich in my early 20's, way back when my food palette and appreciation for good quality food was non existent. I remember thinking that this pastrami was different from Tam's Pastrami, or the local burger joints Pastrami, mind you that was the only food I'd ever really known. Unfortunately at that time I thought "man Langers isn't much, it was ok but it wasn't all that". Oh if I could go back in time and slap myself for thinking that, oh what blasphemy lol.

Well im happy to say that these days im in a much better place with a completely different understanding, palette, appreciation, and hunger for food. Langers Pastrami is head and shoulders above the rest, this sandwich is often imitated but never duplicated. The Pastrami is cooked to a juicy tender perfection. The rye bread is the perfect complement to absorb and hold all the juicyness of that delicious pastrami. Layered in perfect harmony with their dressing and coleslaw, along with a crisp pickle on the side, the famous #19 delivers on every level to deliver a satisfaction unlike any other.<//Review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Old school dinner style. Food was good but overpriced for all the hype. $16.95 for the #19. good thing is that it's a descent size to share if you get a side. chilli cheese fries were good but needed more cheese.
We wanted to try after we saw them on the food network but will not make the effort to go back next time we are in LA.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3hFbfJ3-N24lHT_HDi0f79m4cEENl-lEUS1r5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD3duhZsQkXAyUZGZ0GjOUynQP1sggjeHQx1_n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

I came here specifically for the pastrami sandwhich and it was certainly good. I wouldn't say it's the best because I've had better Pastrami in New York and Italy. However, the customer service is beyond stellar and I would come back due to the friendliness of all staff.</Review>

I have been coming to this place since they opened basically. I moved here about a year ago and have always had a diverse pallet. I wanted some Indian food and was coincidentally passing by. Stopped in and had some lamb curry with nan. Not only is the food amazing, The staff is so friendly and down to earth. When you go in, make sure to ask for the waiter Rahman!! He always has the best recommendations and is so efficient man!! Very knowledgable staff and the atmosphere is great!!<//text>

<Review>Good News Silverlake Echo Park and DTLA folks...La Pergoletta has opened their 2nd family run place on Sunset Bl in Silverlake...just up from Wood.Now it's easier to enjoy authentic Italian dishes more often.The dining room has a cozy atmosphere that envelops you the moment you step inside.There is also an 8 seat bar so perfect for a solo bite and vino after work.Same great home made pasta at neighborhood prices.Open for lunch and dinner.Service as always personable and professional.<//Review>< pics>

Everything about this place was off the charts the customer service, the ambiance, and the food!!! You can not go wrong here, the price was more than fair for the quality and delicious food. The service was exceptionally friendly.<//Review>

<Review>So good, not even a little over rated. Food was delicious and staff was friendly. #19 was great but split it with someone and also get the brisket french dip. Parking was a bit of a hassle, their lot was full and the city does street cleaning on both sides every Friday afternoon; so plan accordingly.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501< /gmap_id></record>

Love getting the dip and of course the 19. I typically went before a Dodgers game and eat half a 19 and take and eat the other half at the ballgame. How do you go wrong with a 19 and Dodgers baseball, let me tell you, you don’t. Goes together like lamb and tuna fish.</Review>

An essential part of the Los Angeles dining experience. Prices are decent, service is good, and food is above average... With that said, the history of this restaurant makes it a "must stop" even if only for a quick bite. Beware, lines are often out the door and you may end up going from "a little peckish" to "STARVING!!!" while waiting...<//review>

< Review>
I went to meet a good friend of mine from Chicago who is in LA. So I didn't really have any food although the food looked amazing, I had a few beers. I will definitely go back to eat because it did look and smell really good. The reason for only having four stars is because the service was a little bit off so you order to your waiter and someone else comes and brings it and they don't know who gets wet because the server took the order so everyone's always getting mixed up about their drinks< /Review>

So, for my birthday my daughter sent me a Langer's pastrami package complete with rye bread, cole slaw and THE BEST PASTRAMI IN THE WORLD..and I am from NYC and know my pastrami..the meat was soooo flavorful and tasty AND lean..really cannot possibly get any better....My wife says the same, also an ex NYer...

Always amazing. Consistently some of the best pastrami I've ever had. Incredibly juicy and flavorful. They use less meat in the sandwiches than they used to, but the price hasn't changed for many years. This is in some ways a good thing; inflation aside, the sandwiches 20 years ago were larger than anyone other than the biggest eaters could handle in one sitting. Now they're manageable by someone like me who has a big appetite. The delicious rye bread is a big part of the equation, made in huge long loaves by a process I can't fathom. I recently discovered a pastrami scramble which is killer. Free parking across the street. I was amazed that there was no waiting on a Saturday late morning- prime brunch time.<//text>

Restaurant is almost half full, quite busy during lunch hour.
Parked across the street in their destinated parking lot, don't forget to get validation after your meal for free parking.

Get seated right away. Old style seating booth type of sofas, not too comfy and there's always someone needed to use bathroom among your group, in and out, making you get up and down from your seat. Some tables are very close to each other, that's a little too close with your neighbor lunch mate.

Waiter is somewhat patience to explain different types of sandwiches and meats and give you recommendations. Tried out a few new stuff because some of us are newbies to Langer's.

Food is great but you have to know what to order. Someone order turkey burger at our table and that's not the place for turkey burger, right?!

** Con - no split check. All in one check and you have to figure how you want to pay at the register in the front. Bathroom is tight, use it at the end.<//review>< gmapID>

<Review>Loved all  aspects of your business and service. However, at the Time of paying the bill the cashier said we don't take American Express . There is no sign that you do not accept such a card. Thank God my sister had a visa. As a good business practice you should post a sign. Lastly, it would be nice to see a BLACK face working in your business. thanks once again for your great service.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Had the #19 pastrami sandwich.  Pastrami was perfect, complemented by coleslaw that was not too sweet.  Bread was soft but had a crust that was amazing.  Sandwich was $18.95 and ice tea was 3.95. So don't get sticker shock.  Worth the splurge.< /text><Time>1539201012524</Time>< user_id>

<Review>The pastrami and rye bread were world class. The French fries were really good. The pickle so-so. The club and chicken sandwhich were good not great and overpriced. The carrot cake is a generous portion but was just meh, we were told it was the last piece and you could tell.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

No dessert counter. The pickles are alright. The sandwich was good. Nothing that shook me out of my boots for how well known the place is. Obviously people love it but I've yet to find the best pastrami or corned beef sandwich in LA. Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

I felt like I was transported back in time when I entered this place.  Real old school deli. I ordered their number 44. It's a hot pastrami sandwich with sauerkraut and nippy cheese. Huge portions. I struggled to finish the whole. It is a bit over priced in my opinion but it the sandwich was good.<//Review>

I mean when you ask the question what does the best tasting pastrami cost, the answers is $20, when you ask why it costs $20, the answer is because that's what Langer's charge. Corned beef on the other hand was really just okay, not even good, definitely not great, it wasn't horrible, just okay.</review>< Pictures>

Until I retired 13 years ago, working downtown LA,  I would eat at Langers several times a year and ALWAYS loved it...their rye bread is to die for as is the pastrami and sweet/sour cabbage soup. Retiring and living in Riverside I rarely get to go there anymore and miss it very much. So, for my birthday my daughter sent me a Langer's pastrami package complete with rye bread, cole slaw and THE BEST PASTRAMI IN THE WORLD..and I am from NYC and know my pastrami..the meat was soooo flavorful and tasty AND lean..really cannot possibly get any better....My wife says the same, also an ex NYer... I sure miss not being able to eat there as I used to. OMG THEY ARE THE GREATEST!< /Text>

Big two thumbs up! Would definitely recommend. The food is absolutely astounding and the service is fast and friendly. Me and my family of six came during the middle of rush hour and we were seated and had our food within 30 minutes. Definitely deserves that World's Best Hot Pastrami title!<//text>

Went here because of all of the recommendations and because of its historic importance. The food was nice and service was good, but it’s extremely expensive for what it is. I definitely could not be a regular with how expensive the sandwiches are.</review>

<text>Wow! Love this place. I went to New York and on intentionally went to Katz and Carnegie's because I do love pastrami. But I have to tell you neither one of them holds a candle to Langer's. If you're in the area you have to try their sandwich. I personally don't like rye bread but they're famous for their number 19 which is a traditional pastrami sandwich on rye with coleslaw. I actually get the pastrami dip which I understand to some people may seem odd but it is the bee's knees. I love their au jus sauce so much I just drink it. Have fun.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</GmapID>< pics>

it's in a bit of a rough area and while it does have some parking that parking gets filled up and so you have to find street parking. I had seen which number 19 which is their best seller. It's a bit pricey it's a good portion but it has no side. The bread is some of the best I've ever had. The pastrami is not the best I've ever had or the second-best it's very good but it comes in so highly rated you set very high expectations. staff are very friendly and I was served very quickly. Eating at the countertop saves you wait time. not quite worth the hassle getting there but it is a good one time experience.<//Text>

When we go to redbird we ten to order a few items and share. It's always delicious.  And the service is second to none.<//Review>

Sandwich was good, but $20 for it (even if it’s a world’s most famous one) is still too much! It’s one of those places where you pay mostly for the brand name, not for the food 🤷🏼‍♀️

Also, no soap or towels in the restroom???< /text>

<Review>To me, it’s very over priced - $17.99 for a sandwich? Granted, they’re pretty huge, but I eat like a bird so I was happy they had 1/2 sandwich and soup for $12.99 - but a cup of soup cost $4 + and the cup is the size of a teacup and VERY simple - like the matzo ball soup was plain broth and one matzo ball - I guess I’ve had it before with at least some carrots and celery, but then again maybe that’s not the classic way of preparing it. It was just kinda bland. Im all for spending $ if the food is great and the portions are large but I guess I’m not much for deli sandwiches. I went there for someone else because they like pastrami sandwiches lol. I think maybe it’s because of Langer’s being ‘famous’ for their sandwiches, they can charge a lot for them.< /Review>< rate>

Langers is the best deli food any of us have had, in LA or NYC! The #19 pastrami is A1, chicken salad sandwich, coleslaw and potato salad are tops...<//review>

No course was so-so to me, those two were just outstanding. Out of the 3 desserts given, the Vanilla Mousse Cake was my definite favorite - that mousse was so yummy, and the caramel inside was an unexpected surprise.</review>

Sorry New York. The pastrami is the best around, and the #19 may be close to sandwich perfection. The double baked rye is really what puts it over the top.</text>

Horrible service, forgot entire order. Yes, langers is busy on a Saturday night,  but no excuses.  We had 5 people, 1 drink each. Took a half hour for drinks to arrive.  Forgot 2 appetizers we had ordered.  Drinks had to " be made downstairs" even though a full bar was 5 feet from where we were sitting.  Horrible experience,  very pricey.</text>

<Review>Absolutely the best Jewish deli in Los Angeles.  There is no close second.   The pastrami sandwiches were beyond great.   We washed them down with perfectly prepared  New York eggcreams.  The service was excellent.   It was well worth the long drive.   We had a great time.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Famous for their pastrami, but my wife and I come here for the fries and the vibe!
It's the kind of place that's been there forever, and people still like it!
Most everything on the menu is decent to good, so you really can't miss. And the staff is rather pleasant! I'm deducting a star for their high prices, and the limited operating hours (they close @ 4 PM, and are closed on Sundays).</text>

Top 10 Best Sandwiches in L.A.
There is convenient curbside pickup for those that fear the park.  That said...put the fear aside!
The first time I took my wife here we had to park a ways away (busy mid week lunch hour). She child me the this better be great...or else!  I want even nervous and she quickly became a HUGE Langer's fan.
I bring out of town guest here and everyone...Same response.
Great food, great prices and that satisfying classic deli feel.
So hey, try it Mickey...you'll LOVE IT

<text>I visited to fulfill a Door Dash... the staff was courteous and prompt.   The atmosphere is bustling and family-like, and the restaurant is big.   The customers looked happy to get their food, so I think they've ordered there before and liked it.< /text>< pictures>

Best pastrami sandwich I have ever had! The pastrami is so soft. It may sound weird, but get the one with coleslaw, it's amazing and massive. The prices are a little high, but well worth it.</review>

<review>I have been wanting to come here for awhile now. With my work schedule, it just doesn't work out and Saturdays get too crazy. When I took a day off of work on a random Monday, I figured this was going to be the only time I can try it. I came there around 12:30/1PM on a Monday afternoon. There was no wait, hallelujah!

The atmosphere and decor really surprised me when I walked in-- in a good way! It was huge inside and the refreshing to see part of the place still had a deli and bakery with an old school bar seating area. The staff greeted us with a friendly and welcoming attitude.

Per our waiter's recommendation, we went with the #19 and the #88 and some fries. Our waiter was extremely welcoming and came to check in on us a couple times to refill water and ice tea. The corned beef Reuben was great. It was warm and soft, but since it's grilled, very crunchy on the outside. The sauerkraut was a good balance to the cheese and saltiness of the beef. You take a bite of the pickle and it's a bit sour-- so you wash it down with some fries. However, as soon as I took my first bite of the #19, I was in love. I knew that if I ever came here again, it would be for the #19. You have to acidity, creaminess, and crunch of the slaw to balance with the pickle, and the cheese, pastrami, and the soft bread. I was never a fan of rye bread, or anything multigrain because I like my bread to have a soft texture, but I did not mind this rye bread!

Definitely worth the hype if you are ever to wait the lines or take a random day off to come here!!</review><userid>103158147270027752547<//userid><Date>1569604805234</Date>< Resp>

This is probably the best pastrami sandwich I've ever eaten EVER! I thought in New York the one deli was the spot but NOPE, handsdown! When you look at the menu, the price seems steep but it's totally worth it! You can share one sandwich no problem as well be sure to try the pastrami chilli cheese fries and the matzo ball soup!! The meat is succulent and the crispy cold coleslaw has the perfect texture and not too sloppy! But the pickle was the grand finale for me!!! Will be back again!!! Free parking validation as well!!!!< /Review>

<name>Mara K</name><Review>It’s really expensive for a deli, but they make better latkes/potato pancakes than my grandma does(which is a feat) so it’s worth it. They give you a big portion and they don’t skimp on the sour cream and apple sauce either, which is key.
The blintzes weren’t great—can’t quite put my finger on what’s off about them but I wouldn’t order them again.
Overall, definitely worth a stop!</Review><response>None<//response>< Rating>

Absolutely the best Jewish deli in Los Angeles.  There is no close second.   The pastrami sandwiches were beyond great.   We washed them down with perfectly prepared  New York eggcreams.  The service was excellent.   It was well worth the long drive.   We had a great time.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit.</Text>

The food is just out of this world. So delicious, lovely people. The chilli fries portions were so generous.  Odd neighborhood for this place but it works, there's good in the middle of the insanity.  We'll be back for more :)< /text>

<text>Highly recommend coming here for breakfast but make sure you arrive early because it gets really packed! I came here with my girlfriends on a Saturday morning for brunch for the first time and had such a great time. The food and service was excellent! I ordered 3 eggs pastrami with hash-browns and hot coffee, it was so delicious and perfect breakfast food. It really hit the spot and made my Saturday! I'm so glad I check out the famous Langer's it was so worth it!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>I've been to Din Tai Fung several times. My boyfriend is Taiwanese and we always go there when he's craving food from home. This last time, though, seems to have been one of the best meals we've had there so far. We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken wonton dumplings (SO GOOD), chicken bun, pork dumplings, cucumbers (my all time favorite), spicy noodle with beef, and a bunch of other stuff (lost track of it). One of the best parts was dessert, of course: chocolate mochi. Couldn't go to Din Tai Fung and not order it! Overall it was a great meal and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in trying Taiwanese/Chinese food.<//review>< date>

Just as good as everyone says it is. Classic joint that one must eat at while living or vacationing in Los Angeles. Found curbside parking pretty easily. Service was great. The pastrami sandwiches are the best. I’ve never had better. This place definitely deserves a 5 star rating.<//review>

Excellent food. The pastrami is excellent is cut with a knife instead of machine. Chili cheese fries are outstanding. When you bite into sandwich it is so tender. Live it and recommend highly.< /Review>

Giving 3 Stars because it's a bit pricey, and parking situation is tough, if you can't get parking on the metered curb, they have a lot a short to moderate walk away. Area is a bit rough and crowded.
The Food and Service are excellent!</text>

We have visited Langer's for many times so I think this is the right time to leave this restaurant a review.

If you want a place with a wide variety of sandwiches, then this is the place you have to visit. They have incredible and original sandwiches. I am a huge fan of their pastrami sandwiches. They have the perfect bread for a sandwich. Well flavored and really creative sandwiches. They also have a wide variety of dressings. Their dressings are what bring a fun twist to their sandwiches. Although a bit pricey but I think it is just fair enough. For me, they have the best pastrami in Los Angeles area. If you are in the area and you want a good and deli sandwich, you should give them a try. I am sure they won't let you down.

By the way, this place has a lot of customers so expect it to be a little crowded.<//review>

Haven't been in years, but it's still the same. Literally, "Too good for words!" Sadly, I can't say the same for the neighborhood. LA has to find a way to deal with the homeless population. Living on the streets is not a solution.</text>

I went to Langer's today and the pastrami sandwich, well, I've never had its equal.
Yes, we waited in line, but not too long, and they brought water out several times, perhaps to keep from losing a customer from a faint on the sidewalk. The service was excellent, as well. WOW!
Bring your wallet, though. Worth every penny.<//Text>< pictures>

Did not disappoint and lived up to its fame. Met the owner and he was a gentleman and appreciative. Worth the wait in line. The area around it is super sketchy but once inside you'll be glad you went.< /Review>

We went for it all! Had the corned beef, pastrami, cheese blintzes, potato pancakes, matzo ball soup, creme soda, and a slice of cheesecake for good measure. Everything was absolutely delicious. The whole family left stuffed and happy.< /Text>

I went to Langer's today and the pastrami sandwich, well, I've never had its equal.
Yes, we waited in line, but not too long, and they brought water out several times, perhaps to keep from losing a customer from a faint on the sidewalk. The service was excellent, as well. WOW!
Bring your wallet, though. Worth every penny.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501< /Gmap_id></record>

Choice of French dipped beef, of course, and lamb (yum), or pork. All the sides and dessert.

<Review>Let me start by saying that Langer's has the BEST pastrami sandwich on the planet. Food is nothing short of tasty. The downside...I went in and ordered to go it was towards the end of the day but regardless, they shouldve been more pleasant. So while the food was great, I didn't feel welcomed.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501<//gmap_id></record>

Having eaten pastrami from the famous Katz's deli and Carnegie deli in NYC, this place doesn't hold a candle to those holy shrines of sandwichdom.   It's just an ok experience.  Way smaller portions.  It is old school in feel and vibe.   Cool if you like some place authentic and historical.</review>

Enjoy the food and the service! Came in for lunch with some friends and everybody had good time here. It doesn’t look impressive from outside but it is a nice and clean place.</Text>

Fresh & tasty sandwich. Had the pastrami special. We were two & asked waitress to split check & was told cashier will handle it. When there, it was a hassle.< /Review>

Probably the best deli & pastrami sandwich in the entire LA area, but the area around it isn't that great and parking can be a struggle. Great food though.< /text>

< Review>
I've been a Canter's girl all my 27 years, and still love it. But, when my boyfriend finally introduced me to Langer's Pastrami-etc? Oh my.

PERFECT meat to fat ratio, awesome pickles, lovely dressings.

The ONLY reason for lacking that starry-eyed 5th star every restaurant seeks, slightly steep "normal" prices aside, is the hours. You guys could do business 24-hours, easily, and still bank more than a profit. And get to see the more "interesting" late night LA people as icing on the cake. (Or mustard on the pastrami, more appropriately. :) )</Review>

Every single ingredient works together magically. From the juicy pastrami to the double baked rye bread. It's like heaven in my mouth.

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Food was great (thus the 5 stars) however as I was waiting for my To Go order, the guy behind the cash register moved an order from the front counter where I was standing, to the back counter (as if I was going to steal it) and the order belonged to me all the time. It felt discriminatory. Left a bad feeling in my gut. I won't forget how Langer's made me feel.<//review>< pictures>

In the four way contest of Langers, Philippe’s, Cole’s, and Canter’s, this is actually the best Sandwiches of the bunch. I don’t think it’s he best ambiance out of all of them, although it does have a cool old school and comfortable feel to it.<//review>

This place has the best pastrami. Period. Anyone who says otherwise doesnt know good pastrami. I have tried every place I know of for pastrami and no one comes close to Langer's. I just wish they would open another location, cause its in a horrible area. Just close your nose on your way from their parking lot if you dont like the smell of urine.< /Text>

My go to sandwich - a Chicken Liver with Turkey - was very good (and easier to get to than Katz's in NYC).  The Matzoh Ball Soup is awesome!  My dining partner was not crazy about his Liver & Onions, unfortunately.  He's a L&O fan, but it was overcooked and rather dry.

<Text>If I am in downtown area and looking to have a great deli lunch, there is no place better than Langer's.  It's a very old world, classic style deli that has been in the area for decades and is famous for their world class Pastrami sandwiches!  The neighborhood is very sketchy but it's like a different world inside the shop.  You do have to park in a lot down the street but it's definitely worth whatever hassle you have to go through.  It's a classic LA experience.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

#19 is sweet-sliced tender pastrami covered in coleslaw with thousand Isla d dressing on twice-baked rye. It is so big you have to start eating from the sides. The crust on the rye compares favorably to the suede e of the#1 lane of the 405 but the center is as soft as your girlfriend's navel. None better on either coast or un between.< /review>

<Text>God like pastrami. I repeat GOD LIKE PASTRAMI! You will never be able to consume pastrami unless it's from Langer's after you go there. It will ruin you for all time. Which is what you want. You want this. You know you want this. If you didn't want this, why are you reading about it? Why would you put yourself through that kind of pain? Just surrender to the pastrami and go to Langer's right now! Be advised they won't seat you until your whole party arrives, which is great but make sure you got your peeps with you so you can get some of that meat gold.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I've been a Canter's girl all my 27 years, and still love it. But, when my boyfriend finally introduced me to Langer's Pastrami-etc? Oh my.

PERFECT meat to fat ratio, awesome pickles, lovely dressings.

The ONLY reason for lacking that starry-eyed 5th star every restaurant seeks, slightly steep "normal" prices aside, is the hours. You guys could do business 24-hours, easily, and still bank more than a profit. And get to see the more "interesting" late night LA people as icing on the cake. (Or mustard on the pastrami, more appropriately. :) )</Review>< Pics>

best pastrami not only in Los Angeles but the world too. Langer's Deli has been written up in magazines and newspapers all over the world as the worlds best pastrami. If you don't drive or don't like to drive take metro red or purple line subway and get off at MacArthur Park station then walk across West 7th street to Langer's Deli.< /text>

The food was great here -- I had a little trouble with the atmosphere.  It felt like a middle school cafeteria. I am used to comfortable deli's I want to sit in for hours and read the paper -- unfortunately, though the matzo ball soup and pastrami was very good -- this restaurant felt cold.  I wanted to eat and get out.  However check it out for yourself. In today's world, deli's are becoming few and far between!<//text>

<pics>None<//pics><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Langer's really is all that!

Cons: Not the best of neighborhoods. Parking is one block up on the opposite side of 7th Street (free with validation). Frequently there is rope line outside to get in. Not open for dinner. Seating and aisles are a bit snug. The prices are a bit high.

Pros: The quality of the food and service more than surpasses the cons. We're talking about one of the finest Jewish deli & diners in the country. First rate ingredients & preparation. Many are made in house. The staff is friendly, courteous, and professional.

Pro tips: Drop your fellow guests at the door side passenger unloading/loading zone, then go park up the block at the Langer's parking lot on the opposite side of 7th Street. Get a parking lot ticket, they validate at the cashier. Ask what the flavor is of the in-house soda, it changes. Leave a worthy tip. Leave with your leftovers, they will hold up.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>What can I say. Well, I can say this: while you will hear the #19 (Pastrami on rye with Russian dressing) ordered a lot here, (and I have had a few myself), lately I have been opting for the "Western Omelette" which is eggs (obviously) pastrami, corned beef, comes with what looks like potato pancakes but it's meant to be like hash browns. Barbara always does an excellent job of taking care of me but on the few occasions that she was not there, other severs did an awesome job as well.

If you do opt for a sandwich, you should also try their ChiliFries! I also hear they have some great pies... So save room for desert.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Typical deli. But with amazing service and long lines on Saturdays (closed on Sundays)

I recommend the brisket sandwich and the home potatoes (in the pic attached)

The neighborhood is “interesting”, and you will see some “interesting” characters around either homeless or asking for money.<//Text>

This is the place. I met the owner. but, he was kinda old school . He liked meeting and greeting new and old customers alike.They had an unbelievable pastrami that brought a tear to my eye. It reminded of Katz delicatessen in New York. You don’t have to be Jewish to enjoy this food. The corn beef was so tender and tasty. The pics say it all! Sorry to the Hat; your pastrami just can’t compare!< /review>

Had the famous #19 sandwich.  Called the #19 because it is $19.  Pricey, but worth it.  Sandwich was near perfect.  I'm not a fan of pastrami too.  Only thing that wasn't good was the crust on the bread which was tough/stale.  Restaurant is old but very clean.   Also the area where the restaurant is located is loaded with crackheads.  Even so, would definitely go back.< /review>

<text>Been coming here for over 15 years, their pastrami is always perfect. Potato pancakes, pastrami chili cheese fries, and grilled cheese sandwiches are always good as well.

<review>Went there with my wife after Women's March. She loves pastrami, I am so-so about it. We split a #19, only on an onion bun instead of rye. Add potato salad and cream soda and it was great. So good we ordered another to take home. She says best ever, I say really, really good. Great service.< /review>< Pics>

<user_name>Eric Bono</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures><rate>3</rate><text>Everything is about twice as expensive as it ought to be. There are no extras to offset the overpricing. A bagel with lox and cream cheese and mealy tomatoes didn't include capers or cucumbers. Sure, it came with half a decent homemade pickle and  four pitted black olives from a can on the side but, was it worth $18 before tax? No, of course not. The servers are sweet at times. They can be amazingly slow to get to the table though. You can't get them to settle your bill from the table. You HAVE to go stand in line and deal with the slow, detached service of the cashiers. People are in lines around the corner for this on the weekends?

Do yourself a favor and avoid lines by dropping in during the week.

I have been to Langer's in a pinch, feeling sick, desperate for chicken soup, and glad to have at least something resembling a deli in the area.</text><Date>1485461144347</Date><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501< /GmapID>< userid>

I LOVE Langer's pastrami sandwich. It's SO tasty and the best I've had ever. I haven't found a place that even comes close to the delicious pastrami at Langer's. Getting to Langer's and parking is a pain, and their prices for a sandwich are a bit expensive, but since I don't get the chance to come here often, I just deal with it. The food makes up for the sacrifices. The chocolate egg cream wasn't really my thing and I tried the pastrami fries, which were good, but I still prefer just getting the sandwich. Can't wait to go back again!<//review>

Langer's is on the pricey, but it's well worth it. I came here for lunch, the service was quick and their French Dip brisket sandwich was one of the best I've had! I was able to share my other half of the sandwich and I left feeling satisfied. Their #19 sandwich with coleslaw looked delicious, and is next on my list to try here at Langer's on my next visit.</text>

Everything is about twice as expensive as it ought to be. There are no extras to offset the overpricing. A bagel with lox and cream cheese and mealy tomatoes didn't include capers or cucumbers. Sure, it came with half a decent homemade pickle and  four pitted black olives from a can on the side but, was it worth $18 before tax? No, of course not. The servers are sweet at times. They can be amazingly slow to get to the table though. You can't get them to settle your bill from the table. You HAVE to go stand in line and deal with the slow, detached service of the cashiers. People are in lines around the corner for this on the weekends?

Do yourself a favor and avoid lines by dropping in during the week.

The #19 was amazingly well prepared, balanced, and tasty. Pastrami cuts were thick, juicy, lean (not thin and greasy), and very, very tender. Rye bread has a crispy crust and fluffy light interior. The slaw, dressing, and cheese are perfectly proportioned and complement the whole sandwich wonderfully. I've had pastrami in New York and would take Langer's over NY any day. Nice staff (sometimes rushed) and cool atmosphere (feels like a Mafia diner). A bit pricey but its worth it, at least once.< /Review>

Sooo mushigina i am - just ordered a 300 $pastrami sandwich  from langers to surprise my husband for bday this was cost of taxi to go and pick up and bring to malibu. We are native new Yorkers and swear by katz deli and had to have my Jewish food expert husband ,who keeps hearing all about langers , try while here on vacation. The verdict is in and he said " hands down best deli and pastrami and soup and food he ever had ! Fyi he's flat emoition guy who is on cheap side and said well worth it and best gift Eva and eating langers is life changing.  Need I say more as his best wife award was just given to me thanks to langers !< /Text>

SO GOOD. I loved my pastrami with sauerkraut. The bread also has a great quality, making an overall fantastic sandwich. I've also had Katz in NYC, and Langer's is definitely comparable, if not better in certain ways. Be warned that this is not located in a "nice area," so be alert around the restaurant.</review>

Most old time restaurants in LA aren't very good.  That's a fact I finally figured out.  This restaurant, however, deserves the reputation.  And even though I have read too much about this restaurant, I still love their pastrami sandwich.<//review>

I heard about the #19 pastrami sandwich and I thought I'd give it a try. OMG...hands down, this is the BEST PASTRAMI SANDWICH IN THE WORLD! Seriously, you MUST try it! We also ordered two ice cold Coronas in frosted mugs; which paired perfectly with the sandwiches.  The service was suberb as well.< /review>

Everything was perfect. Frito misto of calamari & eggplant was delicious, fresh made pasta with shrimp had a lovely light sauce & the sole was perfectly cooked. Deserts did not disappoint either. Italian wine recommended by our waiter was great with all courses. Highly recommend!< /text>

<text>As we all know, #19 is where it's at.

But did you know that their Matzo Ball soup is OFF THE CHAIN??

Not to mention those cheese blintzes. Three pieces of heaven on a plate. Spread some jam on those babies and you are good to go.

I'd recommend splitting the #19 with a friend, getting a cup of soup and sharing the blintzes as a sweet/savory dessert.</text>< Resp>

<text>This is the best pastrami sandwich I've ever had. Hands down, best pastrami ever.

It's not in the best neighborhood, but it's SO GOOD. The deli is open at finicky hours, and the nearby swap meets attract an unsavory crowd of folks, but this little gem of a deli is totally worth the trip.

These guys do curbside delivery, but I highly encourage anyone to come in, have a pastrami, and look at the nostalgia of Los Angeles inside the restaurant. There's a story behind this place, and one of those stories begins with the legendary pastrami sandwich. The other food? It's just as good. Don't forget dessert.<//text>< UserId.>

<text>Best Pastrami Sandwiches EVER!
The Corned Beef had some pickles on it, not sure if it was cabbage or something else. But it smells like feet. Tastes similar to that as well.
Order it on the side so that if you turn out to not like that, you'd have saved the sandwich.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

By far my favorite Jewish style deli in the LA area, if not the country.  The winner here is pastrami - well-seasoned, moist, with the just the right amount of fat. Head in before 11am to avoid the lines - the corned beef hash is an excellent option if you would like something more for breakfast.</Review>

Well, this place is an icon! It was well worth the drive to DTLA for it, too. All I have to say is pastrami pastrami pastrami!!! They are famous for their pastrami sandwiches and rightfully so. There is parking across the street in a monitored lot which makes things easier. Langer's rests on the middle of downtown across the street from MacArthur Park. Not the safest area in Los Angeles, but the walk from the parking lot to the restaurant should be fine. Langer's usually sports a line out the door. That's what kind of place this is. At the time of day we went, it was still packed and no line to get in. We sat down and each ordered a pastrami sandwich and an order of pastrami chili fries. Needless to say, half of it came home with us. I find myself craving this sandwich. Must try if you have guests from out of town. A lot to see down there and the patrons are the Untied Colors of Benetton. Very diverse.<//Review>

Pastrami non pareil. Scrumptious matzo ball soup. Four of us sat at the counter and received better service than one typically gets a a modestly upscale LA restaurant.<//Text>

<review>I love having lunch here.  Even the things that I normally don't like (rye and coleslaw) are good here.  I've only had the 19 and always finish every last bite.  The only thing about the bread i could do without is the crust.  It was harder than i would've liked.  The Pastrami was so tasty.  so many other things on the menu i want to try but the pastrami is just too good

Service: good

Parking:  parking lot on the side.<//review>< Pictures>

We came here for a birthday lunch and what a festive restaurant. We had a restaurant so there was no wait! We had complimentary champagne and then a great lunch with magnificent roses on the table. The service was over the top! We had calamari, crab salad, lobster tacos and other items. As we had a birthday that we had<//review>

<review>First time at Langers, I had the #19. It was the most amazing sandwich that I had ever had. The rye bread is incredible, the pastrami melts in your mouth, and their pickles are to die for. If you're in the LA area stop here you will not be disappointed. It does get busy around lunch time!<//review>< Rate>

<Review>I LOVE Langer's pastrami sandwich. It's SO tasty and the best I've had ever. I haven't found a place that even comes close to the delicious pastrami at Langer's. Getting to Langer's and parking is a pain, and their prices for a sandwich are a bit expensive, but since I don't get the chance to come here often, I just deal with it. The food makes up for the sacrifices. The chocolate egg cream wasn't really my thing and I tried the pastrami fries, which were good, but I still prefer just getting the sandwich. Can't wait to go back again!< /Review>< Name>

<review>Great food and great view, oh, and great service-needless to say this place is great. Well thought out inner space that makes for a comfortable ambiance-this place has everything going for it. The rooftop bar can get crowded but it is a must, the restaurant-well, it's great.< /review>< pictures>

What a cool place to check-out!  The inside is retro diner style and looks like it hasn't changed in decades.  This is a good thing for the food since it was delicious; obviously why this place has been around so long.  Try the #44 if you like Ruebens!< /Review>

<Review>A Jewish deli in MacArthur park.

Holy moly! They have an extensive menu that can take you 20 minutes to decide what you want.  I ended up ordering Half Pastrami Sandwich with Matzo Ball Soup.  Perfection.  What makes Langer's different is the rye bread.  It's soft in the middle and crispy on the crust.  I want to come back here and try the chili cheese fries.

Parking is in the back.  The lunch line can get long so beware.<//Review>< user_name>

When in Downtown Los Angeles, Langer's is a treat, an old style deli with the best pastrami sandwich, crunchy garlic pickles,  and blintzes. An iconic Los Angeles diner of high standards. Be prepared to wait to be seated. It is worth it.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>This place is the biggest scam in LA.  Overrated, overpriced and the staff are arrogant and not very helpful.  $20 for a pastrami sandwich?  $20 for potato pancakes - you are out of your mind.  The food is just ok and lately they reduced the portion sizes.  The owners are greedy and ridiculous.
The immediate area outside the establishment is dirty, filthy and disgusting.  It is also dangerous, you will find homeless, meth addicts , drug dealers, hookers and cocaine everywhere.  Not a place for tourists or families.  If you still wanna go - bring a gun.  Be safe.<//Review>< pics>

Pastrami.  What can I say? It's probably the best pastrami in LA.  The portion was just too big and made me fat.  The cole slaw was so yummy.  The location and the price are the reason I gave four stars instead of five.< /Text>

I expected much more for a $16 sandwich. Better than Subway, but I've certainly had better pastrami sandwiches elsewhere. The location is very dagerous, especially at night. I will likely never return here, just not a good value. They also screwed up my order. Friendly staff though.< /Text>

< Review>
The menu at Langer's is huge, but the only sandwich that anyone ever raves about is the #19 pastrami sandwich. While the sandwich was full of meaty pastrami, and the rye bread delicious, I thought the Russian dressing was a little overwhelming. I can't help but think that Langer's is a little overrated. I still prefer the options at Bay Cities and Apple Pan on the Westside way more. The chicken sandwich and fries were pretty standard as well. I liked Langer's, but wouldn't really go out of my way to visit again.<//Review>

We got the Pastrami chili cheese fries to share, I got the roast beef French dip and my girlfriend got the # 19 pastrami and swiss with slaw and russian dressing on rye. Both were amazing and with the fries, we both took home half of our sandwiches they were that big. Not cheap, but worth it. Only negative is how our food arrived separately,  the 19 was ready fast but had to wait for the rest,  need to do better on that.</review><Name>The Dude<//Name>< Gmap_id>

Has some of the best pastrami I've ever had. One of my problems with it is that it tends to be on the saltier side but not here. I'm also not a fan of Cole slaw but the #19 is simply a must have.<//Text>

Used their Goldbelly delivery service - a complete failure, the delivery showied up a day late.  Goldbelly said it was on the Langers end for the cause of the problem.  Whichever,  I created the order a week early to arrive on my Mom's birthday.  The morning of her birthday I recieve an email from Goldbelly stating their has been a problem and the delivery won't happen until the follwoing day.  Langer's did not even call me to apologize and Goldbelly thought an email notice would suffice.  Well, I disagree, very disappointed in both parties, especially Langer's.<//review>

<Text>Was there around for lunch bought two sandwiches and it up being $40 overpriced delicatessen food not really paying for atmosphere or vibe let alone the view don't understand why this place is so hyped up . Overpriced the reason I say this  is that when you order a sandwich all you're getting is the sandwich and a pickle does not come with a drink nor some fries , you got to get that separate so you're already pretty much $15-$18 into a sandwich and nothing more ...Los Angeles classic ???! Who the hell decides these things? So confused by this place ...🤔<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Is Nirvana just a theological state of being, or is it something you can taste?  Langer's Deli has the answer to this riddle in sandwich form.

Don't get me wrong; I still love Johnny's Pastrami in Culver City and Canter's Deli in Fairfax District, but Langer's has them beat if for only one reason: Langer's pastrami is not too lean; Johnny's and Canters' is.  Trimming all the fat from pastrami kills the flavor, so if you care more about your cholesterol intake than you do about flavor (in other words, you're one of those damn metrosexuals that always make me want to punch something, preferably them and ruin their ultra-styled hair and makeup), go eat a tofu burger and pretend you like it, bozo.

If I have one complaint about Langer's, it's the price.  I wouldn't pay $14 for one sandwich (a satisfying sandwich, but hardly enormous) unless it was one hell of a sandwich.  And as this was my first time eating at Langer's--and I can't WAIT to go again--this qualifies as such.  Sure, Johnny's is a better deal at eight or nine bucks (and they ARE huge), but as much as I like them, they just can't compare.  And Canter's sandwiches may contain more meat and cost about the same as Langer's, but when the meat is that lean, it simply lacks flavor, so I'll stick to the roast beef when I go to Canter's.

So if you're not a stinking metrosexual or dim-witted member of PETA and are able to exercise a modicum of moderation (meaning try not to have more than five pastrami sandwiches a week), you will adore Langer's sandwiches as much as I do.  Just be sure to ask them to be sure NOT to put coleslaw on your sandwich, because sometimes they just can't help themselves.< /text><time>1504468665657< /time>< Name>

Incredible Rye bread and arguably the best Pastrami in the country, definitely in LA. I was however disappointed at the portions (I would prefer more Pastrami and overall bigger sandwiches) and also in the prices. Who wants to pay more than $15 for a Pastrami Sandwich with russian dressing and coleslaw? Its a joke really but they do it because they can, they know they have a great product and people line up all day for it.
Also, the location blows.
Great review because I always base reviews off food, its one of the best corned beef sandwiches anywhere, period. Portion size and experience of eating the sandwich brings it down to 4 stars.< /Review>

ost of the sandwiches run between 17 and $18. The sandwiches are excellent, but  they only come with a half pickle spear, no potato chips, no french fries, no nothing... just a pickle.🙄< /Text>

<text>Pretty good pastrami sandwiches. Good service. You can request your meat to be cut from the more fatty parts for a juicier sandwich. If you go alone, you can skip the lines and head straight for the bar.< /text>< Rate>

Still love this place after decades. Also great for breakfast. Eggs and kippers is my favorite. Get them to make a vegetarian Reuben on their rye.</Review>

Some Asian friends took me here telling me how great the food was and I needed to try it. As a Polish Jewish girl with a New Jersey Polish Jewish family I think I can safely say I know our own food - and a 100 year old place seems trustworthy.

The food sucked though. We got pastrami sandwiches and latkes. No sauerkraut, only cole slaw, which I know is done sometimes but still disappointing, and otherwise all of the food was REALLY under par. I’m happy my friends like my culture’s food enough to try to unwittingly recommend it to me, but now I feel like I have to make some better Jewish food for them.<//review>

You will probably be seated by Greg who by the way loves his job. Please do not get creative.... Just order the #19 already and see why its everyone's favorite.

Best Deli in LA! best known for their #19.  Slow cooked pastrami is hand cut to order, with tangy cole slaw on top. The twice baked rye is made on the premises. Light crispy crust with soft rye center. Also old school Briney and sour pickles. These are tye type that they had in old pickle barrels back in the day.If you live in LA , make the schlep.</text>

This is the best pastrami in America. Better than Katz's in NYC, better than any of it. They hand carve their amazing sandwiches and serve them on freshly baked rye that is only 30 minutes or less out of the oven every time. This place is so damn good it ruins pastrami everywhere else. I'd put it up against NYC delis any day of the week.<//text>

I don't know how some idiots put less than 4 stars for Langer's. If you want Pastrami, there is no better place. The 1&2 star ratings must be competitors or ones that want $3 burgers. There is no other reason.

I've taken at least 14 different people there and they've all fallen in love with the Pastrami. I order just Pastrami on lightly toasted rye. I put my own mustard and mmmmmmm! The best.

It is a 4.5 star rating for me only because they close at 4:00pm; Otherwise a solid 5...<//text>

I would rate this place 6 stars if I could.  It is pricey but definately something you should try at least once in your life.  Get the world famous #19 pastrami with coleslaw, swiss, and Russian dressing.  The pastrami chili cheese fries were also really good. Pro tip: They have their own parking with validation. "Langer’s maintains its own, monitored parking lot at the northeast corner of 7th Street and Westlake, one block east of our restaurant location. Parking is validated for 90 minutes; please get the ticket from the attendant and have it stamped by the cashier when you leave."</text>

<text>This is an historic Los Angeles deli (albeit NOT a la NYC caliber!) Located L.A. historic MacArthur Park, in the Westlake neighborhood; however, pricing, menu & clientele feature mainstream culture-WASP business regulars.

Saw the reviews and expected an awesome place for lunch. The service was average, the food was not special and the environment outside smells funny although inside was clean.</Review>

Legendary Pastrami sandwiches that I think everyone should try at least once in their life if they like Pastrami. They make their own rye bread and cut the Pastrami in a thick steak cut style.< /text>

There is nothing to say about thie place but that it still serves the same quality of food as the day it opened. Besides Katzes in New York this is the last remaining place that hand slices its pastrami. Everything on the menu is delicious</Text>

Yes, the area is a bit seedy, and you'd better keep your hand on your wallet as you walk there, but there is no better pastrami sandwich in the country.  I personally like the sandwich with the cole slaw and dressing, but my family mostly gets the plain sandwich with a slice of cheese. Also try the chili covered fries for additional coronary artery coating yummy flavour. We have always had good service with a smile there, and I look forward to going there today!</Text>

<Review>I don't like coleslaw. But when you put coleslaw ontop of a fresh house made and cured pastrami omg. Heaven! Get the potato pancakes and be sure they are served with apple sauce and sour cream! They should come like that but just make sure, don't miss out. This place is a must-stop eatery while in LA.< /Review>< response>

You can not beat the pastrami sandwiches here! If you are in the area I highly suggest you eat here. The service and people are great and the food is unbeatable. It is a bit expensive but trust me it is worth it!<//Review>

<text>It's definitely an experience going here.  Their entire menu is worth salivating over, and the food is for sure good, but having hit this up not long after visiting New York and Katz's I wouldn't say it's the best.  The parking is pretty bad so expect to pay and walk a bit.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</GmapID>< user_id>

Better than the best! Thankfully they are right down the street! The only frustration is with their hours (only open till 4) but the food is worth it. Amazing.< /Review>

<review>Came here by chance, looking for a place for lunch. Remembered Langer's from "I'll Have What Phil's Having" with Norman Lear and Paul Reiser to have a deli sandwich. Had the #19-pastrami, Swiss, coleslaw, but on toasted sourdough as per significant other (preferred the rye but eh, no biggie). Sandwich is pretty perfect, balancing the hot pastrami (can really taste the seasonings of the meat) with the crunch of a well-prepared coleslaw that complements the flavors of the Swiss and sourdough (still think rye woulda been better but now I'm being whiney...). Don't forget to order fries-crinkle cut crunchy outside with a soft inside, not over-salted, cut just the right size, and a small order feeds two easily.
The service was very, very cordial even after a busy lunch service (we were in a line of 15 outside the door at about 1:15 but the line moves). Our waiter was helpful with suggestions, even dessert. Got the apples pie with brandy sauce and a slice of chocolate cake. The pie came out piping hot, would have liked more apples but still pretty tasty. The chocolate cake was heavenly-three layers of moist not-too-sweet chocolate cake, whipped cream, and a dusting of chocolate. Hey, this isn't a fancy-pants place so don't expect fancy-pants food, but Langer's has been around longer than I have and they still pack'em in for lunch well after lunchtime.
The area isn't the best but the food makes up for any paranoia you may have.

Historic restaurant, been here since the 50's. Kosher food and probably the best pastrami sandwich in town.  If your not use to urban Los Angeles you might find the area a bit sketchy but I worked in this area for years and never had a safety issue.  Parking is difficult but they offer parking a block away on the corner of 7th and Westlake.< /Text>

Delicious!  About $16 per pastrami sandwich, fries not included.
The parking in the surrounding area is terrible but there's a small lot with a Langer's sign, you can park there, walk west one short block to the restaurant and get your ticket validated at Langer's when you pay the check at the cashier. I believe they said up to 90 minutes free with validation. About a 15 minute wait, during lunch hour. I had the pastrami on rye w/swiss,  my friend had the classic pastrami on rye but it comes with coleslaw. It looked really good too definitely not the average slaw. He paid $40 for sandwiches and my lemonade. Other half was lunch the next day.<//review>

My son had raved about Langers for years and said they had the best pastrami sandwich in LA. So I went, my mouth watering with anticipation. I was soooo disappointed! I had the PASTRAMI and SWISS CHEESE Russian Style Dressing, and it was, at best, meh. It was also a ripoff of the Nate n' Al sandwich at Nate n' Al's which is a far better deli, has a much better atmosphere, and you don't have to risk your life going there. I wish I could be more positive, but, meh.< /Text>

On this day I took advantage of Curb - Side - pickup which was very prompt. The food was great when I got back to my destination to eat it. This will be in the books as one of my top 25 picks of all time.

The best pastrami in the world. Most people order the #19 which comes laden with cole-slaw and Russian dressing. I go old school on rye toast with a bunch of mustard.<//Review>

Yummy!  Super busy, and parking isn't the easiest, but if the parking lot isn't full, then first 1 and a half is free with validation.  If you don't plan on eating in, you can call and order ahead and park right next to the building and they'll bring the food right out to you!  Everyone was super friendly!< /text>

Best pastrami sandwich in the world. And when I say in the world I really mean it. This place is amazing but the parking can be annoying.</review>

Great food. Awful customer service. Had 2 minutes to peruse their lengthy, busy menu that had no functionality whatsoever. Whenever we needed to ask the waitress for something like water she just kept asking if we want the check. Very rushed so the experience wasn't that great.< /review>

<Review>The food is good, but definitely too expensive for what you get in my opinion. I decided to try the #19 based on all the reviews. It tasted great, but it didn't have as much pastrami as I expected for a sandwich that cost more than $15.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501< /GmapID><Time>1499530987652</Time><userid>106916074781553100971< /userid><rating>4<//rating>< Pics>

<text>Langer's Deli has mouthwateringly delicious pastrami, the best in L.A. without a doubt! Their potato salad is amazing as well and I have yet to taste the plethora of other amazing eats they have at this grand landmark. Norm, owner and son of Al Langer, the originator of Langer's Deli is a great and friendly guy and everyone else is great as well which contributes to and completes the wonderful atmosphere that this place has. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! If you live in L.A. and haven't had Langer's yet then what's your excuse?? Get over here to this awesome landmark of Los Angeles and try the pastrami sandwiches they offer. Either the #19 or #44 or whatever your heart desires, it's all superb and the customer service is top notch! Spoke with Jeanette Langer, Norm's wife after my meal and she's very sweet, friendly and kind like her husband and everyone else at Langer's Deli. Alright, now that that's done stop reading this and head over to Langer's Deli, you won't regret it!< /text><rate>5<//rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
The only thing wrong with this place is that it closes too damn early. sometimes i be craving the steak from here for dinner. and dinner for me is later than 4pm. this place closes at 4pm. so all i can tell you in all honesty is this is the best restraunt in los angeles. they have the best food. the cooks are perfect. they treat you good. but u gotta get there before 4pm or you can't eat there... I'm more of a night owl than i am an early bird so i eat here on off days. and i feel like i am in heaven when i do. amazing taste and food quality is an understatement yet all i can say to describe all of several experiences at this delicatessen/restraunt.
if u havent been here and u can make it before 4pm. u gotta go. u will not be sorry.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I had a bad experience at  this restaurant today.  I took one picture of the deli counter while sitting at a table waiting for my order to arrive.  I used a 35mm camera.  My order arrived and 30 minutes later the owner approached me.  In an aggressive tone and in front of other customers he told me not to take any pictures because of privacy issues.  He said many lawyers  etc..expect privacy.  I told him I did not take any photos of people and he said take only pictures of the food.  I asked him what is he telling customers who use cell phones?  He did not have an answer.  I wished he would have expressed his concerns before my meal arrived.  Perhaps I would have left but now that I have eaten the meal I had to pay.  This was an annoying experience and I may never go there again.  The owner's behavior reminded me of a bouncer in a nightclub.< /review>< Pictures>

The service from the manager this morning it was horrible! I told her the the order something wrong. And I ask her if the possible to change my order and she was very rude and say. You order this and I cannot changed so we have to pay extra for a simple order!! So rude is something the she can help with it! My last time at this place!!</Text>

< review>
Over crowded, over priced, horrible parking. I Was disappointed from the moment I walked in, the menu prices were extremely overpriced & for a sandwich that much my expectations for quality taste wasn't satisfied. Nothing impressive with the food. I was impressed with how long they've been in business ripping off Angelinos with their prices. Never again.</review>

#eaterfact ™ Langer’s Delicatessen hand slices all their Pastrami, so that it’s served cut perfectly against the grain on each slice.
.
Norm Langer won’t ever slice his Pastrami  on a machine. One reasons is he doesn’t want any cold fat coating the blade from the last cut of meat, as it could harm the quality of the next cut.

<Text>I had heard the Langer's commercials on the radio so I went to try it.  The #17 Pastrami lived up to the billing.  A bit pricey at $16 for the sandwich, but very tasty.<//Text></record>

Beat damn pastrami (#19!) in the country. Beats Wexlers, Katz and more. As expensive as all the others ($18 for the classic) but worth every penny and each sandwich could easily be 2 meals.</Review>

Resisted common urge to either get hot pastrami or the #19 sandwiches. Mixed delicatessen platter unveiled finer details and differences between the pickled tongue, pastrami, and corned beef. Tongue might be my favorite of the three, though.< /review>

I want to try other stuff, but I always get the Pastram. I wish it were in a better neighborhood, but it's part of the charm. The waitresses can be a little short with you sometimes.</Text>

<name>Diana Lin<//name><Text>So this is stop #3 of my self-inflicted L.A. pastrami tour...and I'm proud that I'm still alive.  While other restaurants have been anti-climactic after a multitude of accolades, this deli does not disappoint.

I am proud to say, that I now UNDERSTAND the accolades from The New Yorker, David Sax, Garrett Snyder, and the James Beard Foundation.   I took Snyder's advice & ordered the "plain pastrami sandwich" in true minimalist fashion for take-out for lunch at the office.

The bread was divine: crunchy on the outside & soft upon the 2nd phase of my bite.  The pastrami was complex, marbled, & full of surprises (just how I like it).  My nightmares of ending up in a hospital for high cholesterol...or damned to a bootcamp for the overweight are well worth it ; )< /Text><rating>4</rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1354692985446<//time><gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><user>115697281398825437441< /user></record></dataset><record>

<text>I never liked pastrami until I had the #19.

Thanks to my brother who stops by here every so often for lunch, he brought me back a half sandwich to try.

Oh my goodness, after one bite I fell in love. Like all other pastramis that are piled with just meat, I like the fact that the #19 has coleslaw with the Russian dressing to cut the saltiness and meaty-ness of the sandwich. I always ask for extra coleslaw and Russian dressing because I just LOVE how creamy and delicious it is.The rye bread is nice and soft.

To complement my sandwich, I always get a side of fries, which are nicely fried and golden.

When you walk-in, you feel a sense on nostalgia, like you just walked into some diner in a Goodfellas movie. The hospitality is also wonderful here.</text>< Rating>

We visited Langers last weekend and it has really changed.  I won't go back.  They used to pile tons of delicious pastrami on their $16 ala carte sandwiches.  That's why I remembered the place.  Now, they put about half the meat on the sandwich that they used to, not enough to really appreciate the quality of the pastrami and corned beef.  Forget this place, not worth it anymore.<//review>

<review>Parking is a block away. Food is extremely over priced. Forget about private conversation, always crowded and tables are glued to each other. You'll wait 30-45mins, if you are lucky. If are ok with this and want to pay $20 for a lonely pastrami sandwich, you'll enjoy this outdated place.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Every journey has a beginning and an end.  What is now known, bifurcatively, as the Red and Purple Lines, depending on where you want to go, was not so long ago called the Pastrami Express, and now is Metro Rail's trunk line, which initially was  a mere 5  rail stations, in TOTAL length for traveler's embarking from Union Station,and, then, office workers escaping City Hall, who needed to be gently encouraged to utilize the entire new system. One could just imagine the curt brainstorming session in some smoke filled room, where a pearl of  gastronomic wisdom encountering  bureaucratic need quickly coalesced, and in jest, emanated truth, and the truth simply is... Langers.  Talk about justifiable government intervention. The East Coast (read New York City) might have the much venerated Katz's Deli(been there - what do you think the K. stands for!!!), but we Angelenos have... Langers. Almost enough said.  Pastrami on Rye, Deli mustard, a little horseradish, a dill pickle, and some seltzer water, and you're in business.   Maybe some chicken soup with a matzo ball.  An egg cream, possibly?     Langer's is one of those holdouts that has defied demographic change, and with good reason.  If you come from a cultural experience were something like paprika can massively impact the taste buds you'll understand, if not then there are some wonderful dining alternatives just steps away, and available countywide. Langer's is for meat lovers, not condiment lovers. Not that there is anything wrong with their condiments, but I am kvetching here.    Pastrami aficionados/aficionadas take heed, whatever you've tried many believe this is the gold standard for pastrami and to a lesser extent standard Americanized Central European style fare.  Several well off East Coast transplants send their gofers here, I could name names, but would probably be sued for alienation of affection due to open representation of their hidden guilty pleasures.  Go. Sit. Order. Engage in friendly kibitz/conversation.   Enjoy< /text>

Langer's has been a favorite breakfast place for over three decades. If you want to be impressed by an expeditious, warm, and friendly service, sit at the counter and experience Barbara's service. The matza ball soup is great with Tabasco; challah is sold here. This place is truly a representation of Angelinos; it is aslo a pleasure to see waitresses who refuse to go gently into the dying of the light. This place provides 90 minutes of free parking.<//text>

Hands down the best pastrami on the planet. I have had Katz's, Stage, Carnegie and Junior's in NY and Langer's is the best. Katz's is really good though too. I am not sure I have ever had anything besides the #44, which is a pastrami reuben. I know reuben purists will probably be critical of it not having swiss, but instead their nippy cheese. It is my favorite sandwich on the planet. I told my wife if I had to choose anything for my last meal it would be this sandwich. The location is not great and from what I have heard isn't the most safe at night, but I have only went there for lunch, which is perfectly safe during the day. Free validated parking too. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!<//Text>

MY 2015 REVIEW: BEST corned beef sandwich I've ever had. I'm 50 and Jewish, so I have had my share.  The bread had a wonderfully crunchy crust.  At $15, I was expecting a colossus, but it was average size…if there is anything average about perfection.  Free parking in the Langer's lot one block away.  Next time I'm in LA, I'm heading straight to Langer's. [I did...in 2017]

MY 2018 REVIEW: To assure that Langers is the best corned beef sandwich, I visited the famous Katz's Deli in NYC. Langers reigns supreme. MEAT: Langers is very moist...what I think of as classic. Katz's seems very thick cut and is drier...I consider this unusual. RYE BREAD: Langers by a mile...crunchy crust...best rye ever. Bread stays together for the duration. Katz's fell part before I could finish the sandwich...a pain in the tuchus.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Ok...shut up and take my money!

Rye bread and coleslaw had never tasted so good until they met the pastrami at Langer's. Normally I would not get the Rye bread, and I don't like coleslaw. But the juice, greasy, thick slices of pastrami at Langer's just brings the family all together into a unbelievably yummy sandwich. URGH, just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

Sure, it's like $15 bucks for a sandwich, and subway has $5 footlongs all day, and after tax and stuff, its like almost $17 for that famous #19. Here's a little trick to make yourself feel slightly better about spending that dough. It's the BEST IN LA. ITS THE BEST IN LA. I always have to tell myself that. No joke.

Best Pastrami sandwich in LA. Hands down. Hope they never change. Except for maybe their hours of operations. They close super early on weekdays, and closed on Sundays. Every time I'm here, It's always on a Saturday. So if I am ever in DTLA on a weekday looking for lunch, you'll know where I'll be at.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c79f65c05a3f:0x36ae812febfdc501<//Gmap_id>< Response>

Had it not been for some good friends who got me down here I might still be a Langer's virgin, and what a shame that would be! I must confess, I'm not a big pastrami person. I think it's delicious, sure, but I usually don't seek it out. But since this is supposed to be Ground Zero for pastrami in LA, I had to try it. I opted for the #10, so I could get the cole slaw on the side. Took a little while for the sammy to come out, but wow, when it did was it good. The pastrami itself was quite lean, which I guess it always isn't the case, and to tell you the truth I could've used a little more fat in there, but it was still quite delish. What really made the sandwich for me though was their rye bread with the wonderful crunchy crust! And the Russian dressing was a tangy creamy treat as well. It was so good I ended up eating the whole thing, even though just a half would've been quite enough to satisfy. Dan H and I were saying later we should've just split a sandwich between us--oh well! Their cole slaw was quite good as well, fresh, crisp and sweet with just the right amount of mayo. I think I prefer slaw that has cabbage sliced a bit more substantially with more celery seeds, though, so I can't say this was the best slaw I've had. Next time I want to try their tongue sandwich and the chopped liver, as those are usually the items I go for at a Jewish deli.

Getting here and finding parking's no picnic, so prepare yourself. It's a SUPER-busy intersection teeming with more pedestrians than you've ever seen in LA, probably. I thought I was on Avenida Revolucion for a sec (that's Tijuana, folks). Even though their parking lot was full I was able to find free street parking a couple of blocks away, which is probably a good thing, considering how much I pigged out. The decor and ambiance is nothing to write home about, although it's clean and comfortable. The prices are kind of steep too, but those are all small matters considering their awesome food. It was definitely worth it and will have me coming back for more!</Text>

< review>
the food was excellent and the curbside service is really convenient, very pricey (but worth it) I got a pastrami sandwich on rye and paid 15$ I feel if they throw in a can soda and a bag of chips or a small fry they would kill it even more so< /review>

no automatic pickles
no automatic rye bread
disappointingly small sandwiches
bland matzoh-ball soup
high prices.

Sorry, don't get what all the fuss (and the line) is about. I was expecting the heavens to open when my  pastrami (the vaunted No. 19) arrived, but alas there was nothing special about it -- except its monster price tag. May be worth a stop if you're already in the area, but its certainly not worth going out of your way to visit.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Famous restaurant of Pastrami sandwich

There are more locals than tourists.

$ 42 coffee with sandwich on pancakes

It's hearty and it's also kind to serve customers✌️

When I asked for a sandwich, I chose a side-by-side salad and the restaurant salad was delicious and I was impressed. It is delicious because it has no sweet taste in Japan.

Because sandwiches alone are hearty, sharing should be better if they are women!

And the pancake here is a masterpiece that is hidden
A slightly sweet dough with a sticky texture
I think Japanese people have a favorite taste 🤤

The district with shops is one of Los Angeles's best Dangerous Zones⚠︎

Be sure not to take a walk around the store!
Let's go by a court or a lift
Please pick up a taxi in the shop before going out and go outside 🚕

(Original)
パストラミサンドウィッチの名店🥪

観光客より地元の方が多いお店です。

パンケーキにサンドウィッチにコーヒーで42ドル

ボリュームたっぷりだし接客も親切です✌️

サンドウィッチを頼むと付け合わせのサラダが選べてお店の方イチオシのポテトサラダが美味しくて感動しました。 日本にはない甘めの味付けで美味です😋♡

サンドウィッチだけでもボリュームたっぷりなので女性の方同士だとシェアがいいでしょう！

そしてここのパンケーキは隠れた名品🥞
もちもち食感でほんのり甘みがある生地
日本人の方は好きな味だと思います🤤

お店のある地区はロサンゼルスの中でも指折りのデンジャラスゾーンにあります⚠︎

必ずお店の付近をお散歩したりしないで！
ウーバやリフトなどで向かいましょう
帰りもお店の中でタクシーをピックアップしてから外に出てください🚕<//Review>

The area has become marginal, but there is no place, people come here from all over the city to eat hot pastrami. And they are definitely worth it. Good in every sense. The portions are huge. See opening hours, as they do not chase money and work very shortly, at 16 they are already closed .. there is a parking lot nearby, free for visitors, which is important

Историческое место 1947 года. Район стал маргинальным, а вот место нет, сюда едут со всего города поесть горячие пастрами. И они того точно стоят. Хороши во всех смыслах. Порции огромные. Смотрите часы работы,  так как они не гонятся за деньгами и работают весьма коротко, в 16 уже закрыты..рядом есть парковка, для посетителей бесплатна, что немаловажно</Review>< Date>

(Translated by Google) It was a sandwich and Fries with a lot of juicy meat that was incomparably thicker than pastrami I knew so far. The large pickles that are attached to the sandwich are also worth eating.
A veteran clerk waits for her to be called "honey" and feels a little uncomfortable, but I'm happy that she enjoyed local food in Los Angeles. I would recommend it.

(Original)
今まで知っていたパストラミとは比べ物にならないほど肉厚でジューシーなお肉がたっぷり入ったサンドイッチとFriesでした。サンドイッチに添えてある大きなピクルスも食べ応えがあります。
ベテラン店員らしきおばさまの接客では「ハニー」と呼ばれ続け若干の違和感はありますが、それも含めてロサンゼルスの地元グルメを楽しめたかなと満足しています。おススメです。</review>

(Translated by Google) After reading about the pastrami sandwich at countless restaurants, I had to try it! So we drove to the langer's and could park directly in front of it. The typical looking ami restaurant and the many waiters who looked after you made a good impression. We didn't have to wait long before we were assigned a table and could place our order. The portions, as everywhere, were huge and very tasty. We can only recommend this restaurant to everyone!

(Original)
Nachdem ich bei unzähligen Restaurants über das pastrami sandwich gelesen hatte musste ich es probieren! Wir fuhren also zum langer's und konnten direkt davor parken. Das typisch aussehende ami Restaurant und die vielen Bedienungen die sich um einen kümmerten machten einen guten Eindruck. Nicht lange mussten wir warten bevor wir einen Tisch zugewiesen wurden und unsere Bestellung tätigen könnten. Die Portionen waren, wie überall, riesig und sehr lecker. Wir können dieses Restaurant natürlich nur jedem weiterempfehlen!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) A traditional restaurant in Los Angeles, with the best sandwiches of Pastrami. It has parking a block away and you are valid for 1 hour. The area where it is located is half ugly, but you enter the premises and everything changes to a calm and comfortable environment. The impeccable service. Highly recommended

Un restaurant tradicional de Los Ángeles, con los mejores sandwiches de Pastrami. Tiene estacionamiento a una cuadra y te válidan 1 hora. La zona donde se ubica está medio fea, pero entras al local y todo cambia a un ambiente tranquilo y confortable. El servicio impecable. Muy recomendable.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The pastrami is really good, what happens is that I found it excessively expensive to be a fast food place.

<Text>(Translated by Google) When we come back, we have to go to Mediterraneo's once or twice. The best deal on pastrami sandwiches on Rye to get anywhere. The home made cream soda is a must for us. Delicious. The service is fast. Rather than waiting to sit down is nearby. We will definitely stay there again if I return to the area.
