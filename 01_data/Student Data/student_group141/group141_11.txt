< review>
Ricardo responded immediately when I reached out for help with my laptop. I easily set up an appointment.  Even thought I was very late for our appointment he  made time to see me anyway. He went right to work and was able to fix the problem I was having. He is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. The nature of the issue with my laptop and how the laptop was made limited his ability to dig deeper into the issue. He also explained the limitations and possible negative repercussions should he try to take the screen off. I was grateful he knew that it could potentially make the problem worse. The computer is working great now and he has very reasonable rates.< /review>

Ricardo saved the day! Unable to find anyone who would come to the home since I simply can't problem solve over the phone, he was able to solve complicated problems with ease and professionalism and in a super timely manner so I was up and running in no time.  Very cost conscious as well. Highly recommend!< /Review>

<text>I called today with a simple question about being locked out by BitLocker (didn't know how or why was just trying to delete files on an used laptop I had bought online that I never setup myself)and was met with a rude attitude by Ricardo. I did not feel like I was being helped at all nor welcomed (almost like my call annoyed him). He assumed the problem was just unsolvable with little to no information given or offered. Most other PC stores are super helpful and patient, which is sad this one wasn't. Definitely will be my last attempt dealing with this owner. From the looks of other reviews he has had a history of unprofessionalism and acting condescending...<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

There is nothing I can do for you and that is exactly what I said. If I could have helped  you I would have. If I sounded annoyed in anyway it is with the thought that someone sold you a machine like that and did not give you the pass keys.  Anyway this review is completely out of line since I did not do any work for you at all, in fact I have never met you. You called me to see if I could help you and I can not. Would you rather I lied to you and taken your time up and money?'}</resp>

Ricardo was very helpful - my PC died and he was able to take it in the same day, and had a diagnosis the next day (which was on the weekend).   Took some time to repair, but that's mostly because he had to order new parts.  Ricardo answered the phone right away and we communicated by text regularly for updates on my repair.  Very convenient!<//Text>

<Review>Ricardo is a genius!!  Our computer crashed at the end of the year (worst possible time) and he had us up and running in just 2 days!!!  He even provided us with a working PC for a cheap price so we could close our books!!  He helped us install our software and even brought the computer  to our office to make sure it was set up for us to use immediately!  We contacted another tech before we found SBPCTECH who told us our computer files were lost.  Luckily we decided to get a second opinion and found Ricardo!!  Your files are not lost unless Ricardo cannot find them!! I would highly recommend SBPCTECH for your computer needs.  We will be using them from now on!!  Thank you, Ricardo!!

I needed help with a slow computer and found Ricardo.  Withing a day my computer was examined, parts ordered and repaired.  Ricardo went over the issues with me and his proposed resolutions before doing anything.  He was very professional and informative.  I feel like I'm using a high speed, new machine for the price of a repair.  Couldn't be happier!!< /Review>

Ricardo repaired a broken screen on my laptop.  Nothing special there, except he had the best available price for an off warranty repair.  Perhaps half what Best Buy Geeks or Dell Service would charge.  But the best part is he did the repair on the spot, AND, because I am medically compromised, he came downstairs and carried it up, brought it back within maybe 10 minutes, and tested it out with me on the street!  Perfect!<//Review>

<review>Ricardo instantly knew what I needed (whereas his well known competition had no idea what I was talking about), he called a company where I purchased the appropriate ports and connections that Ricardo installed to have 3 desktops and one laptop connected to two monitors, where I flip a switch to display each computer individually. He worked quickly and efficiently. I work for companies who all want their own computer, so this situation will help in saving space instead of having multiple workstations.<//review><user>100517022252299744849< /user></record></dataset><record>

Ricardo answered the phone and told me to stop by. Two hours later, he called me and texted me a photo of the interior of my laptop, whose motherboard had burnt out, the result of vents clogged by dust. He gave me options and pricing. I ordered a new motherboard, and had it back at the price he quoted in four days. My experience at the Genius Bar at the Apple Store in Santa Barbara has been mixed.

If I could have give 10 stars I would! Because of the pandemic I had to go back to my home country and left my computer (ruined by hot tea) in the hands of Ricardo who did everything he could to send it back to me after repair. After 2 months of USPS and international postal services being shutdown I received my computer in a highly protected package and freshly repaired!

Very Satisfied Customer!  Ricardo is an outstanding PC technician; knowledgeable, fast, and reliable!  He explained the problems he found on my ailing HP laptop, and what he did to fix them. He helped me set up a PC backup program, and took the time to answer my questions and explain how to use my video and malware search programs. He went out of his way to help me get my HP laptop back into working condition. Best PC repair service ever!!</Review>

About three months ago, I had PC Tech replace the screen of my macbook pro. Paid over $600 at the time. The screen died in 3 months and I contacted PC Tech for warranty, he said, I have to pay another 600 for replacement again. I do not know how many of these Google reviews are real!! Maybe he pays others to write him positive reviews. Find somewhere that give you real warranty, not PC Tech scam!!!</review>

<review>This guy is the real deal! My husband and I took our computers to him and he ended up saving us hundreds of dollars! I spilled water on my computer and he ended up being able to save it for me and quoted me half the amount that they would have at the Apple store. He was also honest and told us we could do some of the things we needed done on our own and showed us how to instead of taking our money.

It is unfortunate that I have to write this review on a highly rated place. I am a college student who had recently tried to call them multiple times and didn’t get an answer. I understood they would have appreciated a voice mail but every time I had called it was during my break so I didn’t want to get a call back knowing I would be in class. So I gave it one last shot and they finally called back what a miracle! They began to speak VERY rude with me as I was staying calm because I needed their services. Unfortunately I don’t know who I was speaking to because the call had failed before I could even make my appointment and get his name. I took it as a sign that I shouldn't even bother with them and I took my service else wear.< /Text>

Recently moved to SB and needed emergency PC help. Ricardo was quick, responsive and understanding of my need to be able to get back to work. He fixed the problem at a reasonable price, and on top of that was a pleasure to work with. Will definitely use Santa Barbara PC Tech for all my future IT needs. His place is easy to find and has public parking right next door which also helps.</review>

48 HOUR TURNAROUND TIME! That's how long it took Ricardo to fix my Lenovo laptop in which the hard drive had failed - the laptop would not load the operating system at all and was stuck on the logo screen. He diagnosed the issue and was able to order, install the original operating system, update all drivers necessary, and also install free programs that are used in daily computing activities. Ricardo provided updates while fixing the laptop easily via text message, and now within 48 hours from dropping my laptop off, I'm writing this review from my fixed laptop. His service is fast, reliable, and most importantly well priced! Thanks for the great work!< /text>

I had my hard drive replaced after a hard drive failure by Ricardo two months ago. My hard drive crashed again and I was very upset, I paid several hundreds for the service! So I called him two times and I stop by his office but no one was there and no response to this date, maybe he will call now when he sees this review. He charged a lot of money for the service and extremely poor customer service, I wanted my money back honestly or at least a warranty service! Do not waste you money with this business! Now I am not sure how many of his reviews are real. Will go elsewhere! Stay away from this business.  If I could give him a zero star I would have so!!< /review>

SB PC Tech and Ricardo were extremely helpful and an all round great and easy experience.

The communication between myself and Ricardo was quick, he would never leave me waiting for a reply and would be of great assistance with anything I asked which hasn't always been the case with similar services.

When I went in to get the new screen fixed he did it there and then, I wasn't put into a waiting line as he knew I wasn't going to be in California too much longer which was a great help and extremely good customer service!

Most importantly, the laptop is back to normal, having good customer service is all well and good if they don't do a good job fixing the laptops but luckily Ricardo is good at what he does!

Great experience, I'd recommend it to anyone, 10/10!<//text>

Santa Barbara PC Tech did an amazing job of rescuing my laptop from a near death experience. The service I received was attentive and straight forward. Ricardo was knowledgeable and professional, and I was impressed by how quickly he resolved the issue with my laptop. Despite my coming in being the result of a laptop disaster, the whole experience with Santa Barbara PC Tech was completely drama-free, reassuring, and at the risk of sounding repetitive, extremely timely. And the cost was spot on. I will definitely go back to see Ricardo for any future hardware or software issues. I highly recommend this business!< /Text>

Of course, my laptop keyboard decided to break in the most inconvenient way possible, but when I brought it in to Ricardo, he immediately knew the fix for it.  While we waited for the repair part to come in, he gave me an extra external keyboard to use in the meantime so I wasn't totally in the lurch, and once the part came in, he repaired it to excellent condition in a matter of hours!  Really impressed by the promptness, thoroughness, and efficiency of the repair.  Price was well within my budget too.  Excellent- the go-to guy for SB area tech repairs for sure.<//Review>

So there is Santa Barbara computer repair “pc mechanic” and Santa Barbara computer repair “pc tech” which I was not aware of on the way to my 9am appointment. When I called and let the tech know I was outside he immediately took to me with a serious attitude. I informed him that for some reason I was directed to 309 Micheltorena instead of 903 state and instead of simply re directing me (which I’m SURE this mix up has happened before being that the names and addresses are both very similar) he begins to just repeat himself yelling almost like a child “903 state 903 state 903 state” I work with people for a living and this is NOT how you treat potential customers. I refuse to let people speak to me in this aggravated manor so I immediately told him he lost a client before abruptly hanging up on me.  Plus side, is if his business reflects the way he speaks to other people I just missed a close call on what would have probably been a complete and total scam and waste of money.  VERY sketchy interaction from the get go. DO not roll the dice on this business.</Text>

I was having trouble with my MacBook, so I took it to SBPCTech. Ricardo was able to quickly determine what the issue was. He ordered a new solid state hard drive and in less than 1 week had me on my way. I was only without my computer for no more than a few hours. This guy is quick and very professional. I recommend him to anyone with a computer issues.<//text>

Ricardo has been a vital source of assistance with more than one of my technical emergencies! He is knowledgeable in every aspect of his job. He is trustworthy, reliable, and has gone above and beyond by picking up my PC from my home. I was recommended to him by my mother who also uses his services and relies on him for software advice and troubleshooting.
I highly recommend SB PC Tech for any of your needs!

Excellent services! Had a laptop with broken hinges, and Ricardo was super efficient at helping to find the right parts for the lowest price and the highest quality. I loved the support and his ability to find exactly what was right and ideal for my situation--a very genuine guy and a great service.

He is also no-nonsense and reasonably priced. he replaced the hard drive in my Mac, something I have never had done before, and did it same day, by the close of business. I recommend.

Friendly, approachable, and honest. Ramsin was upfront about what he would and would not repair, but was willing to take a look. One glance and he knew that my computer’s problems fell under what he would not do, but he recommended another repair shop and sent me on my way free of charge. The bonus was to recognize him as a respected junior high school teacher. (Now repairing computers instead.)<//Review>

I have now taken 2 computers to Ricardo with absolutely great results. First he cleaned and restored my Vista Toshiba to factory after finding out the restoration disk was damaged. He also copied the disk and gave me one for future use. He then cleaned a multitude of viruses from my Windows 7 Toshiba computer which is now running great. Thanks so much for all the quality work and service and the price was excellent. If you live anywhere in this area he is the only one I would take my computer to. Quality work and service and the price is right!</text>

<text>I have been travelling abroad on my boat for 4 years and the laptops that had  been with us for that journey were having troubles - very slow to start up and close as well as other oddities.  Ricardo removed many many viruses and malware items (despite the fact that I was running an antivirus software and continually updated it).  He suggested a more robust protection product, which was not super expensive.  He is very competent and his customer service is excellent - calling me with updates on progress, spending time with me when I picked them up to explain situation and help with installation of new antivirus software.  I highly recommend him and will use him again - maybe even just for a maintenance check each time I return from abroad.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1420581723215, 'text': 'Thank you Virginia for the kind review, I am glad to be of service to our local Santa Barbara community as-well as to travelers such you.

Ricardo has helped me with transferring information from one home computer to another. He did a good job transferring the material and he was both quick and efficient. He is also very easy to work with and reliable. Most recently he picked up my home hard drive and took it to his office to get rid of viruses and install a free word processing program. His prices are very reasonable and I completely trust him with accessing the material on my home computer. I would recommend him to anyone who needs his services. He gives exceptional customer service.<//review>

Ricardo is the best. He helped me with my problem in minutes right over the phone. I thought my computer was hopelessly  possessed by a demon. Turns out he knew exactly what the problem was as it was a new virus going around that was just discovered THAT VERY DAY! He was on top of the latest problems in the digital world and knew exactly how to fix it and it was fixed in minutes.  I know you need to stay on top of the latest threats to computers these days but the very same day? That was impressive. I highly recommend this guy Ricardo and his Santa Barbara Repair services.</Review>

I am 84 years old and a late comer to the computer world; a babe lost in the woods so to speak. Finding a trustworthy guide to keep me in the computer world is important to my well being. PC Tech is the place. You will be cared for and treated fairly.</review>

Very quickly fixed our problems with viruses.  Before Ricardo came, we had a low confidence with our computers. Now that he's been here, we are sailing again and no worries anymore.  He developed a protocol to maintain a virus free environment for us and we couldn't be happier.  we will use Ricardo from now on for all of our installations and maintenance.  We found him to be very honest and reasonable in cost.<//Text>

Ricardo is fantastic! He has helped diagnose and repair my laptop on more than one occasion and has helped resolve other hardware issues as well. His work is always solid and is done swiftly with a true sense of urgency and importance. He is the only person I will go to for my tech/computer needs.<//review>

My elderly Dad had connectivity and printing issues and Richard figured them out in about 5 minutes as well as recommending a router upgrade. I highly recommend.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rate>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Santa Barbara Computer Repair was recommended to me by someone who raved about their quality of work.
I am grateful for their recommendation, and I believe in Paying it Forward.
Plain and simple this company has INTEGRITY!!!!!
I had a shattered laptop screen and I called to have it replaced.
To say I was surprised after speaking with the owner Ricardo, is an understatement.
Not only did he let me know how and where to order a replacement at a great price. He also instructed me on where to learn how to install it.
He could have taken my laptop and fixed it, and charged me three times the amount I paid to do it myself.
How many company's do that???  Very few. That gesture alone has brought me back to them time and time again. A smart business move on their part? Heck yes!!!! I'll never go anywhere else. No one should.
They guarantee their work. There's no run around. Just a company who wants the same thing you do. Quality work, honest people,  great price.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I've used many computer repair people over the years, both personally and for my companies.  Hands down Ricardo has the most expertise I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  He shared with me ideas of what I could do next with my grim computer situation and did not charge me for the time he gave me.  That is SERVICE at it's finest.  He did also fix my issues.  Thanks Ricardo.</Review>

I had a laptop with a screen that was blank.  I talked to three different places and they all told me to buy a new one! I took it to PC Tech where Ricardo took less than a minutes to tell me he could fix it for a very low expernse, and it could be ready in 5 or so days.  I was surprised to receive a call from him that same day that he had found a loose connection and that the laptop problem was solved!  He is easy to reach by text and phone and since this is not a large firm, you deal directly with him with no bothersome transfers between different people.  Call Ricardo, and you get Ricardo and in m y case, he solved the problem the same say I brought my laptop in</text>

Fast turn around and very friendly service. Ricardo was welcoming from the first minute of my phone call with him and was great when I dropped my business laptop off. He explained the service options clearly. He also phoned/texted periodically to give me updates on the repair. After all of that the cost for the repairs was a bargain!
While I certainly don't hope that my computers crash again, its good to know that great help is around the corner with Ricardo.</Text>

Ricardo was very helpful and patient when the wifi in my computer stopped working. I took it to the Apple Genius Bar the week prior that and the technicians there could not figure out what the problem was–they thought it was a software issue and told me to create a different user for my computer and a bunch of other things that never worked out. Ricardo sent me some helpful articles about cheaper options to fix my problem right away and once I took it to his office, he found the problem really easily.< /review>

<text>Fast, friendly, personal service.  Ricardo searched suppliers for the least expensive part, and had my HP laptop fixed in a couple days.  Did a free tune-up while he multi-tasked on another customer's computer and engaged in friendly banter.

Contrast with HP who I called, spent 45 minutes listening to underwater music, transferred 5 times (yes, count them, FIVE!) and had to reiterate the same information each time.  Finally informed the two year warranty I purchased started from the purchase date of the computer, one year prior, and was no longer valid!  HP is a dying company, being run into the ground by hyper aggressive marketing jackals who don't know a screwdriver from a voltmeter.<//text>< pics>

< review>
My laptop screen broke right in the middle of an extremely hectic week.
Ricardo accommodated me on short notice and replaced my very finicky screen.
He also took the time to speed up my computer and showed me some new and easy tricks so that I can keep it running fast (and healthy). Also, the office is in a very convenient location.

I HIGHLY recommend.< /review>

Santa Barbara PC Tech helped me out of a big bind with a small job today.  Ricardo was able to fix a keyboard on a very old laptop I still need to get on a network at work.  He was prompt, responsive and respectful.  Pricing is fair.
The whole operation is straightforward and honest, and I recommend it highly without reservation.</Text>

Two of my hard drives died on me, with over 1 TB of data. These files were extremely important to me and consisted of music, videos and family photos accumalted over the past 15 years. Ricardo was able to retrieve all my files in a quick and timely manner. I have used him in the past and will continue to use him in the future. Highly recommended and always trusted...thanks Ricardo!</text>

Ricardo seriously saved me! I cracked my entire laptop screen rendering it utterly useless right before a weekend I had 2 DJing gigs - needless to say, I panicked. I was able to text my issue and received a prompt response. Dropped my laptop off the next day and picked it back up before end of day, looking good as new. Cost was more than reasonable and far less than online estimates. Crisis averted - thank you SB PC Tech!<//Review>

Went to see Ricardo at SBPCTECH regarding an ailing older Mac desktop computer tower.  He diagnosed the problem quickly and ordered an out-of-production card from eBay and got the computer up and running.
I’d recommend him for quality, speedy, economical and friendly service.<//Review>

PC Tech was able to meet with me immediately and had fixed my laptop in the same day.  I appreciated how open he was about the different options, his plan for how to fix the hinge, how much it was going to cost and why, as well as that the repair was faster and less expensive than it would have been elsewhere.  I highly recommend this business..< /text>< Pictures>

I appreciate the prompt and personal attention I get every time I have a PC worked on.  Unlike when I have brought a problem to the "bigbox" staff for repair,  here the problem gets resolved in a timely manner and at a fair price. I strongly recommend you try them out.</Review>

I recently arrived into SB via Kabul, Afghanistan. I am "technically challenged," and my MacAir wasn't logging onto the internet. By word of mouth I had heard of the great IT service available from Santa Barbara PC Tech. Upon arrival, Ricardo took no more than a few minutes to diagnose and repair the issues with my Mac. Ricardo's professionalism, IT knowledge, and customer service were great! On top of everything else, he took care of my problem with no charge. I would recommend SB PC Tech to anyone looking for a reputable and professional IT outfit.
Thanks Ricardo,
Victor</text>

<Text>I went to Best Buy with a failing hard drive, and they were rude, tried to get me to pay $1000 for recovery without even looking at the machine, and then tried to charge me 35$ just to use their internet to pull a file off my own machine.  They _really_ upset me, so I left, without letting them touch my computer.

I went to SB PC Tech instead, where I got excellent service, great price, and zero data loss.  Ricardo replaced my hard drive and cloned all the data, all the files, like a boss.  My machine works great now--he even helped me optimize some of the running processes so I get better system performance.  Turn around was fast and I left happy.  I will definitely go back to SB PC Tech.  I don't think I'll ever bother with Best Buy again.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I came here after my hard drive broke. Pretty much all of my data was retrieved and also got my hard drive replaced, all at a reasonable price and in a short period of time.  The technician, Ricardo is fairly flexible on time and will get back to your messages quickly.  Overall I had no problems with my experience at Sbpctech and recommend coming here with any of your problems with your computers.< /Text>

<Review>I highly recommend SB computer repair.  I needed my computer fixed fast since I use it for work everyday.  I called Ricardo and took it in the same day.  Not only was it repaired quickly but the price was very reasonable.  Ricardo explained all that was wrong and explained how he repaired it, even giving me tips on how to prevent problems in the future.
Thanks SB Computer repair!</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

<Review>My MacBook Pro's Retina display was destroyed, and the cost to fix it was crazy. Luckily I found Ricardo... He found a replacement screen for a great price and charged very little for the actual labor. The screen replacement took less than an hour, and he let me watch the entire time. He cleaned out my laptop, which was FULL of dust, and replaced screws and other things for free. Ricardo is really nice, he has a cool office, and parking is free. Great deal.</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Name>Martin Wolfenbarger</Name>< GmapID>

<Text>I brought my inoperable laptop to SB PCTech after a very unpleasant experience with a local big box store PC maintenance service. The contrast was striking: the diagnosis was accurate, prompt and honest, two options for resolution were proposed with a clear price estimate, and the actual repair was conducted efficiently in one fifth of the time and $90 less than the competitor's quote.

The whole experience revealed a professionalism and integrity I was no longer expecting in electronics repairs...

I highly recommend SB PCTech.<//Text>< pictures>

Ricardo rocks! My 8 year-old Vaio was shutting off from over-heating and I brought it in to have the dust removed. Ricardo took out his stethoscope (dare I say computer doctor?) and diagnosed that my fan was failing. He installed the new fan and cleaned out my laptop while I had my favorite cappuccino at Handlebars. He gave me very useful tips regarding computer maintenance that only a veteran knows. Thanks Ricardo!</text>

Ricardo was completely transparent and honest with me when I was having issues with my video card. I dropped of the PC, he booted it up, quickly diagnosed the issue, and gave me some honest advice without asking me to pay for this consultation. He earned my business and the next time I have a PC issue, he will be my first stop.< /Text>

Ricardo is a computer doctor.  He diagnosed my Toshiba laptop and my Mac which were both working extremely slow.  He found and exterminated 100's of viruses on my laptop and knew just the remedy to fix my Mac.  He was fair in price and quick to get my computers back to me.  I highly recommend this company and trust them with my valuable information on my computers.<//Text>

Really great experience with the guys from Santa Barbara PC Tech. Extremely fair pricing and 100 per cent honest with whatever the problem may be, for example, my tablet I believed to be broken and in need of a new battery etc. Ricardo originally told me it would be 40 dollars to diagnose it, however it turned out all I needed was a charger and battery. The guys at SB PC tech ordered me in the new parts and only charged me based on that. 5 stars from me.</Review>

<text>I'm visiting Santa Barbara from Florida, for what was supposed to be a month, but due to Irma my flight was canceled. I'd purchased a cheap new laptop Acer Aspire R15 upon arrival here. Wednesday Last week I spilled water on it, due to the nature of this laptop and the various positions in which it can be used; the water spilled on the backside of the keyboard (into the vents of the computer) I've never seen anything die so fast in my life!

I let it air out a couple days, reset the battery and plugged it in... nothing happened...

Because I didn't think I'd have time to send it back to Acer for repair; using my phone I googled laptop repair and after seeing the reviews, I chose this one. Brought it in on Friday had it back Monday.

Sooo glad I did! Fast courteous and thorough! Very reasonable price and works good as new!

Thank You very much!!!<//text>< pictures>

I struck gold in Santa Barbara.  I have traveled the world, burned through dozens of computers and never could find a really competent computer repair service when you needed one most, the moment it was no longer working.  Ricardo was right there, with help and options.

I am extremely pleased and will sing the praises.  In tune I hope.</text>

Very quick, trustworthy, and inexpensive. I searched around a lot before deciding which computer repair place to choose, and I'm very glad I decided to go with PC Tech. He even went beyond the problem I brought to him and cleaned up some other hardware issues I was having at no additional cost.</review>

Sunday morning went into work to get ahead of the game; pushed send on e-mail and screen went black and smelled smoke – OMG!
Within 30 minutes on a SUNDAY - Ricardo showed up at my office, checked it out, took out power source and off we both go computer and power source in hand to Goleta for BB store.
Bought new power source - installed at register not the problem but when turned on and there is the smoke, mother board fried. Refund on power source, new computer purchased and back to the office.
Bottom line:  Within 2.5 hours he had my new computer going, data transferred from old hard drive (thank you God) software reinstalled and my system was restored.
I highly recommend Richardo and Santa Barbara PC Tech:  Dependable, honest, knowledgeable and they complete the job.   THANK YOU!<//Review>

<Text>SB PC Tech saved my computer and thus my academic life. I stupidly stepped on my laptop and cracked the screen one night. I was still able to use it but the pixelation and damage was getting worse so I contacted ricardo and he explained what he would do. He's very loyal to his customers and I am happy with the results!<//Text><username>Raven Chambers</username>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1418402828120, 'text': 'Thank you Sha Sha for the kind review.  While no one likes to have computer problems., the simplest solutions are often the best ones. Broken earphones is a prefect example of this. Why replace the motherboard when with a little ingenuity we can fix the problem for less then a quarter of that cost of replacing the board. Have fun on your trip back home and if you ever need our service again please call.'}</response><text>(Translated by Google) Owner: Mr.Racardo is a very skilled, responsible, and helpful person! My Mac laptop accidentally pulled out the headset (the headset for the iphone) while listening to the song with one earphone, leaving the other half in the computer, resulting in the notebook not being able to be inserted or inserted. headset. . . Once I found the Apple Store, they had to charge 500 knives to replace the parts. In desperation, I found Mr.Racardo through an enthusiastic student of UCSB. For the first time, because I stayed for a short time, I could not take out the residual headphones. The second time I finally succeeded in taking out! And throughout the process, he is so patient, serious, meticulous, and after listening to help me repeatedly, the charges are super reasonable, I am sincerely grateful to Mr.Racardo! In addition, I would be grateful that he also helped me repair the glasses frame for free while waiting for the glue to dry. It was really moving. . .
I wish Mr.Racardo's business is booming! all the best! And I also strongly recommend that friends with computer problems can find him with confidence, I believe he can help you solve the problem!

(Original)
店主：Mr.Racardo 是个极其技术精湛，认真负责，热心助人的大好人！我的Mac笔记本电脑在一次用耳机听歌的过程中不小心拔出耳机（用于iphone的那款耳机）的时候，把另一半留在了电脑里，结果造成从此笔记本不能外放也不能插耳机。。。曾经找到Apple Store结果他们要收费500刀左右更换零件，无奈中通过UCSB的一个热心学生找到Mr.Racardo ，第一次因为我停留的时间短没能取出残余耳机，第二次终于成功取出！而且在整个过程中，他是那么的有耐心，认真，细致，取出后还帮我反复试听，收费也超级合理，我是发自内心的感谢Mr.Racardo ！另外还要不胜感激的是，他在等待胶干的过程中还帮我免费修理了眼镜架，真的是太感动了。。。
在此祝愿Mr.Racardo 的业务蒸蒸日上！一切顺利！并也强烈推荐电脑有问题的朋友放心找他，相信他一定能帮助你解决问题！< /text>< UserId.>

{'time': 1567099694782, 'text': 'Hi Stephanie Rodriguez, you must be friends with Stephanie Fonseca,\nI have never even spoke to you so this is a fake review and you have been reported to google. This review I can only imagine is because of a couple of friends think they are clever.  Anyone who has worked with me knows I am completely professional and polite.  Here is the review and the reply I left to the other Stephanie an hour ago\n\nStephanie fonseca\n1 review\nan hour ago\nIt is unfortunate that I have to write this review on a highly rated place. I am a college student who had recently tried to call them multiple times and didn’t get an answer. I understood they would have appreciated a voice mail but every time I had called it was during my break so I didn’t want to get a call back knowing I would be in class. So I gave it one last shot and they finally called back what a miracle! They began to speak VERY rude with me as I was staying calm because I needed their services. Unfortunately I don’t know who I was speaking to because the call had failed before I could even make my appointment and get his name. I took it as a sign that I shouldn\'t even bother with them and I took my service else wear.\n\n" Stephanie Fonseca you spoke with me the owner, I announce my name when I answer the phone. You called me over and over again, when I did not pick up you would not leave a voicemail message. When I with clients I do not answer my phone as courtesy to those I am currently working with. I called you back twice and on the third try you picked up. The call failing is beyond my control. Sorry you are going through computer troubles, no body likes that. I asked you about setting up an appointment and you started talking about your class schedule at which point I suggested you call me back when you figured out what works for you. Maybe you might want to take a communication class while you are in school. Be aware you just signed your name on the highest rated computer service company in Santa Barbara because of your impatience and troubles. I have nothing to do with you other then taking your call. Future employees will see your name here as I rank at the top of the charts on Google. Leaving me a negative review because you are having a bad day is completely uncalled for. Good luck to both of you "'}< /Resp>

<Review>This is a review of leasing experience:
I am very happy with the service and communication during the self guided tour, application and signing the lease. My leasing agent is Jayme Non and she is very nice, answering to all my questions in a timely manner, few times she replied to my emails at 9 or 10 PM, which I really appreciated her prompt reply. I will update my review after moving in and living here for few months.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Staying for four weeks and it's a home away from home as the rooms are equipped with all you would need to be comfortable, the kitchen has all you need to make a great meal, the guy equipped with state of the act equipment and the pool shallow but standard length. The machine learned lift gives you access to your floor. Great view from the high floors the building is over 40 floors.<//Text>

The team is rockstar status. I signed. Got to see the unit. Multiple times. Jayme was the wind beneath my wings - ask for her! So excited to call this place home. The units are stunning. The building makes yah 😍. 18+ month lease? No prob. I’d be crazy not to call this place home. Super fast email response - the best way to connect with them!< /text>

Be prepared to climb the stairs or wait at least 20 minutes for the elevator to come! That happens every weekends and during dinner hours of everyday.
And wait for a week on replacing the light bulbs!</Text>

I love living here. The service team is great and speedy. The front desk is always friendly and willing to help. Alanna helps if there is any issues with my lease. Plus it’s very clean, the cleaning crew is amazing. There’s a good vibe about living at 399 Fremont. My neighbors are also respectful and good natured.<//review>

Disorganized management of offices. I
Moved out 12 months ago, changed jobs. I handed over (at no cost to 399 Fremont) $1,500 of furniture I had Purchased for my apartment so they could stage the apartment when I moved out. Paid my last months rent and left. 12 months later had debt collectors chasing me for an unpaid cleaning bill. Apparently, for some strange reason 399 Fremont staff could not contact me via email at my old job because I was no longer there. Not once did they consider picking up a phone and calling me instead they brought a debt collection agency in and I got Demanding calls for a debt I did Not know I had. Poor management, don’t recommend. Apartment was ok, lots of dogs in the building though, so if you want peace and quiet look elsewhere.< /Review>

5 stars for Ksenia for helping me with my lease! She was incredibly helpful in planning my move and get the best valued offer, with detailed cost breakdown. She answered all my questions promptly, patiently and honestly. Leasing at 399 Fremont was a smooth and pleasant experience! Thanks Ksenia!

The apartment and the building are beautiful!<//Text>

<review>The building is nice with good amenities but covid obviously took that away and they are now on a reservation basis.  Management is not the best - when covid hit and prices dropped they couldn’t care less. In fact, they raised the fees on moving within the building to cheaper options - we feel it is not the way to retain your tenants and we are moving as a result (ironically enough this made us look for places to buy in the city as prices dropped and we found an amazing home). Front desk staff is wonderful, especially Jessica. The worst thing about this building are the elevators that go to units above the 9th floor (there are 2 sets of elevators , only one of them reach floors above 8th). Expect to wait 5-10 min and if there are a few people in the elevator then you need to wait for the next one because of covid. Out of the 3 elevators 1 is always reserved for move-in move-outs which is also the only elevator that will take you to -1 (package room). We felt with better management this building could be perfect.< /review>< pics>

The building is nice but the management company is a mess. They ignored tenant complaints about broken elevators and running water until the city inspectors got involved and when it comes to renewals, they will increase your rent by hundreds of dollars despite having quite a few of the same units available at a price lower than your current rent. They also act like they are doing you a favor with this rent increase. I would not recommend renting from any UDR property.</Review>

After a year of dealing with water pouring down stairwells and into lower level apartments and common areas, constant elevator outages, no hot water, maintenance intrusions with no notice, and threatening to tow guests cars you paid to overnight park - I just received my renewal offer which was 10% higher than my current rate and $300 higher than my same unit on a higher floor with a better view.  ?????  Seriously??? You take advantage of your residents after putting us through a year of hell?? I’m out. Don’t stay here. It looks pretty on the outside- but is horribly mismanaged. It’s not worth it.< /Text>

The 399 Fremont living experience is exceptional and all of the concierge/maintenance team are wonderful.  The location is perfect and the units are new and well appointed.  I couldn't rate this community any better.</Text>

Just moved in so this is an early experience rating.  Facility is good.  Four stars.  Early experience was two stars.  No one returns calls,  no welcome I information, no mail key, late to meet us to move in, top floor which is advertised on website is only available to apartments above 33 floor.  Generally unhelpful attitude.</review>

<review>Nothing works in this building. We've been residents for almost three years. The elevators are almost always broken, the ventilation system distributes odors from everyone's apartments so whenever anyone cooks, the whole floor can smell it, packages are always misplaced or lost. UDR just don't know what they are doing. The only redeeming thing about this building is the view and Krystal who runs the front desk - she is awesome.</review>< Pictures>

For the first 18 months the appeal of the downtown location and illusion of luxury living was enough to satisfy me, but after a string of maintenance issues and lack of clear communication from management the frustration is significant.

The website advertises: "The ultimate in the metropolitan lifestyle is all yours at 399 Fremont, San Francisco's most coveted new address. Experience high-rise, luxury living complete with exceptional design, sophisticated finishes, and world-class services."

World-class service? I'm sorry, but when the water is constantly being shut-off and the elevators are out of service (on a 42 floor building), I don't think it is appropriate to classify that as world-class service. I understand issues happen that are sometimes out of our control, but the response (repairs to rectify the issues and communication with residents) has to be better.</Text>

We currently have had only 1 elevator serving 34 of the 42 floors for 5 days. An apartment above me flooded in last November and I was effectively homeless for 4 weeks, now when I tell them that the new floor that was installed is cheap plastic compared to the engineered hardwood that I did have, they claim it's the same floor effectively calling me a liar.< /Review>< pictures>

We love living in this building (we have for 2 years now). Some things I would like to highlight though:

Improvement points:
- Elevators maintenance: no secret this is a big pain point
- BBQ grills maintenance: they are often dirty and not all grillers work, this needs immediate attention
- TVs: similar as above, when we arrived to the building they all worked perfectly (including the one in the Veranda) now sometimes they don't and you cannot longer use the hdmi to connect an external source like a PS4 or a computer
- Turnaround on staff: a lot of new staff that often don't know what to do when something is asked. Some of them (the new ones mostly) don't even say hi when one enters the building

Keep doing:
- Classes: yoga, core, bootcamp, these new guys are great
- SPA temperature: hot tub temperature is now great, pool could be a bit warmer
- Pool area: always in great condition, love the addition of the ping pong table
- Treats: it's always nice to get a muffin or a cookie
- Management response: normally pretty timely and friendly same with maintenance requests< /Text>

Have lived at 399 for more than two years. While this is advertised as a “luxury” building, it could not be less true!  Here are the ways it is not a luxury building:
1. As every other review states the elevators are continuously down / out of service. And there is only one elevator that goes to the basement from the tower. When that is not working it is a huge hassle to pick up packages. Staff normally does not know why elevators are down or when they will be back in service.
2. The Luxor Locker system could not be more difficult and inconvenient to use.  True luxury building would have actual package delivery personnel. In addition a true luxury building would have refrigerated package storage for grocery and meal subscription deliveries. Nope! They left mine in a Luxor Locker for a week while I was traveling.
3.  Luxury buildings have staff who continuously maintain and service and clean the building. Not at 399. There are three large black stains on the carpet on my floor. They have been reported by several tenants. Attempts were made to remove them but they persist. The carpet needs to be replaced. In addition the floors of the elevator lobbies on each floor are filthy with skid marks, hairs, pet dander, dust balls, grime and a few times dead bugs. The building has severely cut back on maintenance so there is very little cleaning being done.
4.  Two of the steps in the main lobby have the tile cracked off of the edge of the step. This is a physical hazard and someone is going to trip or fall on them. So it is a danger and a gross liability. Further a luxury building would not let cracked off flooring tiles remain for months. A true luxury building would have repaired that within a couple of weeks of it happening.
5.  The building is so poorly run that several times a week the staff sends emails trying to locate the luggage trolleys which residents use to porter their own packages from the basement up to their unit. A true luxury building has porters who deliver packages as requested. It’s symptomatic that management has not put any system in place to secure and track the whereabouts of the luggage trolleys.
6.  The trash rooms are no longer being cleaned.  So there is an odor when you step off the elevator and leave your apartment and when you need to dispose of your trash be prepared to gag. There is a mountain of boxes and garbage in open paper bags on my floor. The buildings solution:  a policy that all tenants are responsible to take their boxes and any trash that will not go into the chute down to the basement and to the trash dumpsters. Oh and what a joy that is when the “C” elevator is not working. The building has a “fee” in place which they will charge for violators. And a recent communication said that repeat violators would be in jeopardy of having their lease terminated. Luxury buildings have service staff who make the rounds of all the trash rooms and remove the boxes and rubbish and mop the floors to keep things looking nice and smelling clean.
7 The physical amenities are good but again because the building is being run on a shoestring budget, the amenities are not maintained.
8 So if you hail from any world class city like LDN or NYC, and you have lived in an authentic “white glove, doorman” luxury building,  you should eliminate any of those expectations if you are moving here because you will be sorely and continuously disappointed.</text>

<review>I lived in 399 for 2 years and I must say it is a beautiful building. BUT, the leasing office is EXTREMELY IRRESPONSIBLE once you are their residence.

I booked the guest suite with the leasing office for 4 nights for my parents, but upon checkin they told me they only have 3 nights. I don't know how could this even happen, really unprofessional. We ended up paying 1 night extra because they want a bank check and I already got that. And they promised to deduct the extra night to our next month rent, which NEVER happened!

Later, they said they will refund it with our deposit, which also NEVER happened!

It's now been over 2 months, after so many calls, there is NOBODY called me back or provide me any feedback!<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Tried to have a birthday party for my cousin at the common area on the 6th floor, but the front desk didn’t like us for some reason and threatened to charge us $150 per hour if we continued our party. People use it all the time for barbecues and parties and I don’t see anyone getting charged. This apartment has a good reputation for finding creative ways for getting “unwanted guests” out.<//text>

Good apartment building until something goes wrong and you need their help. After 2 years, I moved out and still have phone calls and emails that have not been answered. Also, the move out procedure is awful and puts a bad taste in the overall renting experience. They will charge excessively for anything-during my walkthrough we jointly identified damage on the walls. I agreed to pay. Weeks later I get charges for damages on the floor that were never mentioned on the walkthrough; that's the whole point of a walkthrough. The process and subsequent convos were very cold and transactional. For this alone, I wouldn't recommend the building unfortunately.<//text>

<Review>Not worth your money. This advertise as a luxury building, however the problems with the management team make it lower than common living in SF.  We only lived here for 3 months, but the experience has been definitely the worst I have had in the city. From elevators not working or being operated at unsafe capacities to poorly maintained apartments and common areas. When we moved in the apartment was in terrible conditions (not even regular clean), the walls had cracks and terrible paint. This speaks to a bad property management team. The service folks at the concierge and Dave from the maintenance team are mazing, they do their jobs the best they can with the terrible management they have.

I will recommend you look at other options.<//Review>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><review>My husband and I were very excited to live in this downtown luxury high rise that offers spectacular views of the Bay Bridge and promises top notch amenities. However this is such a poorly run operation that they have no right to advertise as a luxury amenities building until they get their act together.

The initial tour that is given to prospective tenants is impressive - the building offers an outdoor pool with fire pits, lounge space where you can work from home or entertain guests, a package room, an indoor gym with towels and granola bars and a tap providing still and sparkling water.

After I moved in though I came to learn it was all for show. The fire pit was broken for most of the time I lived there (7 months). The towels and bars were available maybe about 10% of the time.  The tap was either out of water or out of drinking cups. The lounge bathrooms which we used frequently since my husband worked from home didn't have soap in the soap dispensers - talk about a health concern! After months of asking for the soap to be restocked we were told that the dispensers were broken and it will be taken care of, but it never was.

Our apartment happened to be located around the corner from the garbage room and boy was that a mistake! The hallway absolutely reeked of garbage. I complained about this problem from the very first day we moved in and countless times there after. I was promised this would be looked into, that the carpets would be cleaned to hep get rid of the smell, but of course nothing was ever done. I was forced to inhale a whiff of garbage every time I entered and left my home.

I can't even begin to explain the frustration with the package room - it was constantly so overpacked with packages that you could hardly walk through let alone find your package. I spent countless hours going back and fourth between the front desk and the package room trying to locate my packages, sometimes I never did. It was an absolute disaster. The current building where I live now has a package coordinator that organizes the packages and is there to help if you  have trouble locating your package. Just another example of how truly poorly run this building is.

On to the fancy lounge space - We reserved the private room with an adjacent kitchen months in advance to host my family for a holiday gathering. When we arrived the day of, the kitchen was so dirty and sticky that we didn't want to touch or use anything so we reheated our food upstairs and carried everything back and fourth from our apartment - which kind of defeated the main purpose we even reserved this space in the first place. Also the space was not marked as reserved and we had to uncomfortably ask our neighbors to leave repeatedly through out the night. Even though we were ultimately not charged for using this lounge it still didn't change the fact that we were paying an exuberant amount in rent money every month with the promise of a luxury amenity building but weren't actually getting that experience at all.

Perhaps the main problem were the elevators which broke down a few times a week which either left you waiting in the elevator bank for 20 minutes and made you late for work in the mornings or just left you stranded with no choice but to walk downstairs from the 23rd floor.

We voiced our concerns many times over email and in person. Although the staff was very nice and courteous and always listened patiently to all of the problems the building was experiencing, no one ever actually did anything to fix them.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

UPDATE: OCTOBER 2018

TL;DR: Not worth the cost!

Since my original review, I did not have a good experience at 399 Fremont and ultimately decided NOT to renew my lease.

Here's why, in order of issue for me:

1) Maintenance of public areas is awful. Always dirty, almost never cleaned.

I was forced to put in multiple service requests just to have spilt coffee cleaned up from the elevator landing area on my floor. It sat for over a week and I had to submit MULTIPLE requests because the maintenance team would mark it as completed without cleaning it up. One time I even mopped up the area myself because I was embarrassed to have people over.

The same goes for other public areas. After complaining to building staff and managers for months, nothing changed.

2) The little things were always broken. The outdoor fireplace by the pool was broken for the ENTIRE year I lived there. The building manager told me that the parts were on order. For a year?! Really?

Same with the coffee machine in the lobby and other equipment throughout the building. It's insane for such a new and expensive building.

Every 3 months they sent me a survey. I'd fill it out and then receive a reply from their staff with half-answers to everything. Nothing changed.

3) The Luxor Package service they make you pay an additional fee for when you move-in is a complete joke. DO NOT PAY FOR IT.
The idea is that packages would be placed into lockers and an access code would be sent to me.

Unfortunately, that almost never happened. My packages were always thrown into the package room where I was forced to spend 20-30 min looking for them. Sometimes I didn't find my packages at all. Other times, I found my packages in a literal plastic (trash) bag in the corner of the room. Even more often, I would not get notified of the delivery at all and would find the package at the front desk the next day.

4) The front desk staff are awful. I'm not sure why, but over the last two months the desk staff were always temporary workers. Every time I asked a question, they would say "I don't know I'm just a temp."

Just a few weeks ago, the hot water was turned off for the entire building. No one contacted residents to let us know what was happening. I called the front desk and the most unprofessional person answered "What?" When I asked if the building had someone working on it he told me, "How am I supposed to know?"

Other times they gave me flat out wrong information.

5) The building had a fire in the 34th floor trash room in late August 2018. The sprinkler system knocked out power to the entire building for a day. While they got the power back on inside the apartments within 24 hours, the hallways and public areas remained pitch black for several more days. Why are there no emergency lights? We also had large dryers in the hallways which were so loud I couldn't sleep.

Afterward, the entire building became a construction zone for over a month. Hallways, the lobby, gym, etc had holes in the walls because they had to replace anything that got wet. After a few weeks, it became an incredible nuisance. Dust everywhere, paint dropping on the floors, ripped up carpet, etc. Plus, workers in the hallways banging holes in the walls at 7AM.

We still had to pay full rent through all of this chaos.

6) The elevator issues are true! They were fine for the first few months, but quickly became an issue. While it was common for 1 or 2 of the 3 elevators to break down, it was even more common for the maintenance team to lock Elevator C for hours and hours at a time for their own use - not just move-in's as they claim. Elevator C is the only elevator that can access the basement level, where the package room is located.

The issues only became worse after the August 2018 fire. There were many times when I couldn't even call an elevator, so I'd have to stand for a half hour trying constantly for an elevator to be called.

7) Quality of cabinetry in the bathrooms is low. They use cheap chipboard and cheap gym looking tile.

Overall not worth the cost. Look elsewhere!<//text>

<userid>102701797082604269535<//userid><username>Nick Zahner</username><Date>1488933445081<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I moved into 399 Fremont last September, thinking that I had found my dream apartment.  Unfortunately, it’s been one nightmare after another.  Shortly after move- in, for example, two of the three elevators that service the more than 40 floors in the building were taken out of service, leaving just one elevator to accommodate more than 440 units.  At times, people would wait more than 30 minutes just to get into the elevator!  It took approximately three weeks for the building to repair the elevators completely.  There was very little communication to the residents through this difficult period.  It was only after multiple requests of management that we finally received periodic updates on such a life-impacting issue.  Traffic in San Francisco is already tough; but when you need to plan an extra 30 to 45 minutes just to leave your home in the morning, it’s an issue that deserves routine communication.  Even now, one year after the building opened, the elevators are riddled with problems and frequently go out of service for days on end due to the need for certain special order parts.

The response to the elevators is reflective of a system wide issue at this community. There simply aren't enough competent people on the team to manage a building of this size and complexity.  For example, since, move-in I have had a persistent metallic, whining noise emanate from my ceiling. In its best version, it sounds something like a loud buzzing bee or fly; in its angrier version, it sounds more like a circular saw.  In spite of dozens of communications to the management team, providing recorded samples and detailed timing information when the issue arises, the problem has not been solved nearly four months later.  The irony of the issue is that when I first moved in last September, the noise was present.  After two weeks of back and forth communications and maintenance requests, the building’s maintenance supervisor determined through consultation with the original construction contractor that it was a valve defect causing the noise.  The remedy he applied then was a replacement of the valves.  Unfortunately, the issue returned on November 9.  When I communicated to 399 Fremont management that the valve problem had returned, the responses were dismissive (e.g., “What we hear is normal air handler noise,” “Everything’s operating as it should”).  It took until February 15 and perhaps 50+ emails, multiple phone calls and meetings, before the building finally acknowledged that it was a valve defect that needed to be addressed.  I suffered with a known issue for 3.5 months due to stubbornness and/or incompetence on the part of this building’s management and maintenance team.

It's unfortunate that 399 Fremont cannot get the fundamentals right. It detracts from the exceptional service that a number of folks on the team provide day in and day out. In a building without ongoing maintenance and service issues that cannot be solved, these folks would truly set the community apart. But with so many flaws (and I just identified two here; there are more), their efforts get diluted. There are many new apartments in this area. I strongly encourage you to look somewhere besides 399 Fremont. Choosing this place may just end up to be your worse nightmare!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I was here on the last Saturday before Christmas to ship a package. Was dreading the wait, given the long line of people in front of me. To my surprise, the line moved quickly. Impressive, given there were only two clerks working. Really appreciate the USPS stepping up, dealing with Covid & the huge volume of holiday shipments!< /Text>

I respect what the USPS does.
But this branch is just abysmal.
Waited 45 minutes in line, no exaggeration. 20 minutes in, 2 of the 3 counter workers went to lunch/on break.
Tried to get a PO Box. Elaine did not know what an insurance card was, which is one the acceptable forms of ID listed. She could not find my last name on my drivers license - my name is so long it's on 2 lines. She then argued with me about my name.
Ultimately, no PO Box for me here. I'll find another location, which is probably healthier for me anyway at this point.</Text>< Gmap_id>

I love my local post office.  I mail things via certified mail a lot and have nodding acquaintances with the postal clerks here.  I have never had anythng but professional and pleasant service from any of them.  And their jobs have got to be as difficult as the ones at the DMV. (Where I have gotten the worst customer service EVER)< /review>

Then I asked them to let my new contract run concurrent since they didn’t sell the 3 month product.  They outright refused me the same box number though it’s not a policy. I wanted to pay for the month and then run my new contract concurrent, bu my they refused my payment and Attempted to deny me my old same number back. After multiple calls and discussion with an upper level supervisor and two incredibly frustrating visits I have the same box number.  It’s not a written policy the USPS won’t allow a customer to run contracts back to back with the same  PO Box.  It’s not okay to create policy on a whim.< /text>< pictures>

<text>Fast service no problems

Read some of the earlier reviews about the staff. Old Asian lady who regularly serves me is a nice person. She helped locate a missing parcel to another address by checking her internal system. Sender incorrectly wrote house number. She then advised to try calling on the door rather than wait for it to turn around. Good tip and got parcel right away! Agree she speaks rather loud but what’s wrong with that? Don’t we all have flaws in ourselves? Have dealt with other staff and they were equally nice. Not sure where the poor comments are coming from.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>The worst worst worst station ever. If I could send a audio or video review I would be screaming the whole time. This one delivery guy always is late and then lies about him coming to  your house.  He doesn't show up and he doesn't leave pink slips and then lies about it by putting on the tracking system that he comes right before final collection (5pm). He always does this. People like this destroy trust. And not to mention he talks like a complete idiot. I'm going to find out his name and talk to his supervisor to advise them to FIRE him and permanently ban him from delivery services across the world.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Old lady, Elaine, is incredibly rude. Couldn’t find my letter, told me I wasted her time. Her voice was loud and tone was unprofessional and rude. Then she made me call to carrier to check where my mail is, since as she told me it never arrived to their office.

The carrier trucked the package to that post office, and even told me the day and time it was scanned there.

20min later another post office employee found my letter. Thanks God!< /review><gmap_id>0x8085871023c45d25:0xee6ecfd82a84d46c< /gmap_id><Resp>None< /Resp><Name>Veronika Kotckovich<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

USPS needs to just go away!
They have absolutely no accountability for being abusive to your delivery.  If they "lose" your package they don't care in the slightest.  Our mail walker intentionally smashes letters into our boxes and knows full well there isn't anything anyone can do about it.  Doesn't deliver packages because he just doesn't want to and says nobody was home, causing packages that were paid to be same day to be over paid week long fights.

We have these guys on camera doing this.  I'm not just some hater, the overwhelming proof on VIDEO should be enough to make them change their ways... but they live in a country that makes their company invincible to consequences.

I'm not asking for improvement anymore, usps needs to just go away.  They need to hand in our key and just wither away like any other company would do if they displayed half of the malice towards their source of income.< /review>

One was a Christmas present for me that was apparently stolen by employees or thrown away; it wasn't returned to sender. The second was expensive medication refilled online through Walgreens; after calling to set up redelivery, the package now has said "Out For Delivery" for a week, but no delivery attempts are made; this one seems to be lost too.

Why is re-delivery apparently broken at this USPS branch? This needs to be fixed.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Worst customer service I've ever had. They should fire all the staff and replace them with people who actually appreciate having that job. If I bring my business there, I'm helping with their paycheck. The people there are very difficult to work with, speak little english, try to rush you out the door, and cant seem to explain anything clearly. I loath this particular post office.<//Review>< Time>

I'm not sure what the problem with this PO is. Speed is problematic,  but that's part for all of them. Same for UPS and Fedex, and they can cost more. I sell on ebay, and they've always handled my packages fine. What I don't like are the affiliate usps, like those at Staples. If it's complicated, they don't seem to do as well< /Review>

Woman who is working there has no idea what she is doing. Her name is Corlata or Carlotta (not sure how it's spelled because she had no name tag). I filed the complaint on this post office as horrible people are working there.</text>

<text>Avoid avoid avoid. Prime example why USPS is going under/cant break even.
Called a dozen times, and it rang and rang and rang. I was not going away since they lost my package yet marked it delivered. Finally, someone picked up.

I started to talk and had not yet explained ANY of my question when she said "what? hold on let me transfer you." I said "wait wait wait! dont transfer me!" desperate to talk to the person I had gotten on the phone. Instead, she ignored my comments and put me on hold, where I've been holding for half an hour now.

Hope they get laid off. Waste of tax payer money.< /text>< Pictures>

My experience here sucks!  lady mess up and send my package to Gabon-Africa instead of the place I wrote on the paper and box. Of course, its been over a month and the box is missing. I found out because in the receipt that she print says Gabon-firstclass. When I went to ask her she told me I should have check right away where she was issuing my package! So I should have check the receipt she print for me? I didnt know its my responsability to check for their mistakes.  LOST my money LOST my package because their mistake and they dont want to be responsable for anything.< /Review>

Came to watch a football game. They ran out off all food before halftime. It was colder at night. They didn't offer any coffee or hot chocolate even though it was in the menu. They were out. Have a very rude staff. Game was good. Stadium needs a lot of help though.<//Review>

The stadium is in a transitioning state so half the stadium is not in use. This also causes the food lines to be long< /Text>

Attended a soccer game. Nice pitch. Team is good and plays hard. Well coached. Student fans super rude and obnoxious. About half didn’t stand for national anthem, just played on their phones during National Anthem. Unbelievable disrespect and reflects very poorly on the university.< /Text>

<review>Parking and associated traffic for football game was horrendous. Disorganized, not enough cops directing traffic... An unpleasant situation and the crowd wasn't even that big. The stadium itself was a little cleaner. Looks like they power washed the walkways, stairs and maybe stands. Maybe it'll be better once they redo the east side, which right now has no stands while the prep to build the new structure. Which I hope will happen soon.<//review>< rate>

<text>I go to the stadium to watch SJSU football. It's a fine stadium for college football. The seats are bench and mostly comfortable. The consestion are reasonably priced. Parking adds to the cost sure so bring some cash. It's an older stadium but money has been spent well to keep it up to date. The large screen in the southern end zone is really nice.<//text>< Pics>

While I attended SJSU, Billy Graham held a week of revival meeting at CEFCU Stadium, aka Spartan Stadium. This is the only time I saw Billy Graham in person, but I am very grateful God allowed this. Every knew he was a charismatic but hearing his sermons and George Beverly Shea sing were the high light of my time at SJSU.< /text>

<review>This place is sad. Went to see a lacrosse game and the stadium look like something that was stuck in the 50"s "Go Rydell High".  It is Silicon Valley"s SJSU with all the money around this area and you have a high school tier stadium, like I said before it lloks like the 50"s.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Very dated stadium, old cramped seating - basically could not sit for the entire game.  However, the game was a lot of fun and the fans were very hospitable which made up for the substandard facilities.< /text>< user>

Decent.  The stairs are a beast to get inside  (really steep). It is better to walk around the sides.</text>

Small, but relaxing B&B located in central LA in an historic private home.  Not fancy, but well run by an engaging owner and lovely staff.
Wonderful cooked to order breakfast served daily.  Feels more like staying with family and friends.< /Text>

<text>Found this little gem on our first stay in Hollywood. We got the cozy guest cottage that was very homey and clean with comfy pillows. It is nothing extravagant or fancy but it was just what we were looking for. The owner is very nice and helpful. Best of all parking is included in price. It is also within walking distance to food and other businesses. Perfect location. If your looking for something affordable, unique with a good location give this place a try. We will be back. Thank you!<//text>< Resp>

< Review>
Absolutely my wife and I had a fantastic time staying here. The building is an old mansion which gives a quaint atmosphere that you're walking do somebody's well-designed house. We stayed the Hollywood room which was spacious and tucked away at the top of the stairs. The chef makes fresh breakfast in the morning at a communal table. Great coffee great company great prices. This is one of those hidden gems in LA. Stay here if you were going to be visiting one of the many consulates in the area since they are literally a 10 to 20 minute walk away. I would stay here again and again and again.</Review>

<text>The perfect bad and breakfast. For almost 150 usd per night you get to stay at this beautify decorated home in a great location in Beverly Hills.you really feel at home. Diana (owner) is the most friendly person. Very open and welcoming. Rooms are just what you need, comfortable bed, clean bathroom  (private or shared) WiFi, Cable and an amazingly well served breakfast.
Please say hi to the Chef! If you are nice to her she will treat you like a Mom.<//text><username>Omar Esnaurrizar< /username>< gmap_id>

Wonderful accommodating host, super comfy bed, and a delicious breakfast cooked to order by their in-house chef.

<review>We arrived at Cinema Suites B&B warmly greeted by Michael! He escorted us to our rooms, very comfortable! I slept really well, and only 10 miles for LAX.
The breakfast was so delicious. The chef made my special request. Did I mention, the fresh squeezed OJ?  If you get the opportunity, stay here and leave refreshed!</review>< Name>

Very nice rooms, loved the premium movie channels. Close to downtown and the pacific coast, everything you need is less than 15 minutes away. Convenient parking. Friendly and talkative staff. Highly recommended and I will stay here again when I come back.</review>

<Review>I stayed at this place because it was cheap and close to where I needed to go. It's a mom and pop place and run like one. They give you the kitchen and most of the ground floor to work with. It's not beautiful but it is relatively clean and well maintained. The major downsides were that the WiFi doesn't work well, the room is tiny (8x9ft,the bed takes up most of the room space), the fruit in the basket was somewhat old and rotten, and the people in charge were not always accessible except during daylight hours. Not bad but you get what you pay for.</Review>< Rating>

Really excellent place. Incredible breakfast, the help was super nice, and the mattress was actually comfortable. The place feels well cared for as well. They were super accomodating and allowed us to alter our reservation to add a rollaway when a friend wanted to stay with us overnight so she wouldn't have to drive home exhausted. Would definitely stay again!<//Review>

What a disappointment. Very hard to find, Not what I expected from a B&B, I left immediately, didn't stay overnight. The bed linens are old, the kitchen smelled of vinegar and I was turned off from the gentleman who was friendly tho not wearing shoes, just thought it would be a pristine place with professionalism.  Not worth the money and pictures are deceiving.<//Review>

Drove up with a flat tire.  The tire didn't need to be replaced, just a cap. The guy waved me in, so I pulled in. But when I told him I just needed a cap to be replaced, he told me he didn't have the time and told me to drive to.a shop down the street with my flat.

Fair enough, I thought. But then I thought, why did he wave me in in the first place then? I realized that when he found out that it would just be a quick, low cost fix, it wasn't worth his time, so he told me to get lost.<//Text>

< Review>
Only mechanics who have worked on my car since I bought it 3 years ago. I dropped $600 on a new shifting cable. It’s been 7 months. Check engine light back on and temperature gauge not working. These are the wires to my temp sensor. Looks like a perfect snip to me that finally broke apart. Pink looks like it’s about to break next.</Review>

This place is a rare find! They are honest and a pleasure to work with. I asked for advice on what is and isn't worth fixing on an old car, and appreciated the thorough and responsible explanations provided. This will be my go to highland park service center!< /Review>

Always the best service. Owner Jeff still runnings things. Manager Alex is working out great. Love these guys. The mechanics were listening to carnival music one day, and then later on, classical guitar. They are very eclectic to say least, but ANYONE who listens to music like that while working cars, I call that magical. ...Legendary.</text>

This is my second time coming in for a flat tire over the past few years, and both experiences were great! This time, I came in on a Monday morning, expecting a long wait, but instead I was in and out in no time. The service guys were super friendly and helpful, didn't try to upsell me on anything, and their prices were cheaper than Costco. I really appreciated the friendly and quick service and this will always be my go-to tire place!</Text>

<Review>I had not had any issues with my car up until a week ago, so I was starting from scratch with automotive care in LA. I am so relieved to have found Affordable Care of Hollywood. I knew I was in the right place after sitting in the waiting room for a half hour and overheard Stacey fielding multiple calls from prospective clients inquiring about estimates from other shops. He walked them through how they were being overcharged, possible reasons for why and what his shop generally charges for the same services. One customer, in particular, he urged her to not drive her car or have it towed to him from the desert but he would help her find a trustworthy mechanic near her. I mean who does that!? Keep in mind they are busy so get in there early but are worth the wait because they care, they are trustworthy, honest, and they get the job done.< /Review>< user>

Very helpful been here twice now. Even when it was busy, they still managed to help me out on time. That's huge because not a lot shops do that. This place is very close to where I live so that's a plus. I went to a tire shop that's in cypress/glassel park and  well, didn't do it for me. Anyway this guys will really help you out right out the gate.<//text>

<review>Jeff is super nice, funny, and honest, and he seems to always jump on helping everyone all the time yet still manages to make sure things are done quickly. I’ve gotten oil changes, new tires, and some other part replacements done here. I will keep going here for as long as I live in the area.</review>< Pictures>

The owner is very ADD and sometimes you don’t know which car he is working on but if you wait 10-15 minutes he will check in with you. Also if you’re confused just ask him questions. Anyways I’ve had wonderful experiences hear each time. He’s always so fair and helps you save money.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c4120a5c0ca9:0x1b43b74c87a6134c<//gmap_id></record>

I like the owner Jeff. He cracks jokes but not because he is mean. He is happy and has been working on cars forever and he knows his stuff. Shop is always pretty busy so best to come in early morning.

Great work at great prices.</Text>

I check in at 8 am and in ~15 mins fixed my flat tire. They cleaned the punctured hole with the rasp tool put a sealant and plugged and re-aired the four tires. They did a good job and price is affordable $.<//Text>

<username>A Smith<//username><time>1487956989340</time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I have been bringing my jeep here for repairs for years. Brakes, oil changes, battery change, tune-ups. Jeff will not rip you off. He has always given me options "ok cheap way" (what I can afford)  or "better" (usually what I can't afford). I have heard him argue and haggle with vendors and supplies over prices "You craazzzy, customer not pay that!!"

Yes this place can be very busy and parking kinda sucks. Jeff is a nice honest guy. People that have called him "rude" just don't get his humor and lack the patience to wait for service. I would rather wait longer for better, more honest service, than go to the sleazy d-bags that are usually option #2. (just my experience)<//review>< Pictures>

Jeff is the most honest mechanic in LA. He's always honest and goes above and beyond for a super reasonable price. I can't recommend him highly enough.</Review>

The only reason I do not like this place is because of Jeff, the owner. He can be very rude most of the time and say things he shouldn't. When I had my VW, he would always make me feel like I made a bad choice. He thinks everyone should be like him. They are always so busy there so don't go there on the weekends. I recommend Advanced Automotive Care which is 10 mins or less up the same street from Jeff towards Eagle Rock.<//Review>

<Review>I hesitate to divulge my mechanic, but at this point, he's already the worst kept secret in the area, as his garage always has client's cars in it.

For essentially anything major, I refuse to take my car elsewhere. He's honest, efficient, and effective.<//Review>< Pictures>

More impressive than the tremendous facilities are the coaches and staff of 360.  My son has been going here since they opened and loves everything about it.  Highly recommended!< /Review>

Totally worth it if your going more than twice a week but I wish the prices would stop moving 💯< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2b56e93fc42df:0x34e810ec60851622<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1502376660717</Time><name>Daryl Wilson<//name><Text>State of the art basketball training facility. Vertimax training, ball handling skill training with virtual trainer with multiple level workouts to chose from. Shooting machines aided by computer that tracks and instantly reports feed back on your shot arc coupled with multiple drills to chose from during shooting. Also provides feed back via email on shooting percentile for every workout. You are also able to schedule workouts by APP you download to Android or iphone. And monthly fee is very reasonable. Facility is clean, air conditioned, and basketballs are available for both men and women. 1 on 1 training, group classes, and week long camps are available. A great place for all ages, girl,or boy ! I personally drive from Riverside CA to Torrance, LA for my son to use this facility to better himself.  The Inland Empire needs 1 of these SHOOT 360's badly ! There are YouTube videos showcasing the facilities.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Everything was freshly prepared in front of me. The place was very clean and proper sanitation precautions (gloves) were taking when handling the fruit. Kind of pricey but worth every penny to enjoy such succulent flavors.<//text></record>

<text>This is the second time I've been to this place and both time I'm not satisfied with my order. Both times i ordered a mangonada and it's super watery 5 pieces of mango to much chili. It seems like the workers don't know how to make any raspados. If you guy are interested in a different I've been to la real michoacana next to the indoor swapmeet! There raspados are better.<//text>< Pictures>

They did not have enough people working to get orders out very quickly. Even with the girl making drinks for the store and the drive thru as well as ringing up in store customers working like a madman. She was still polite and friendly.
I am giving the rating for upper managments needing for better Saturday personal scheduling.<//Text>

Very clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. Due to Covid-19 we were unable to enjoy our drinks in the facility. It does have a drive thru. I walked in and not sure how fast the drive thru was. Drink was made to perfection. ☺️</Text>

Service was fast and pleasant employees even though we were the 1st ones in and we went back for 1 more drink. Definitely could've put a but more Carmel in a "Carmel" drink. Only complaint really.</Text>

Drive through person that handles the money hands the cup to you by holding the top of the cup where I'm about to put my mouth.  When I said something about it I was told (I only tough the edges.)  This happened to me at 2 different stores in Rocklin Ca. This has to be blamed on Management.< /review>

<pics>None</pics><review>This has always been my top to go to Starbucks because of the environment. Super nice employees and are very up to my standards, with cleanliness and professionalism. The environment its self is very cozy, they recently upgraded there furniture. I would also like to add on that it gets quite busy here during the weekdays and especially on Saturday because of Sierra College is right across the street. But I have no problem since I come here usually the evening.< /review>< Date>

This is a great Starbucks right across from the college and the service is fast and friendly. Not too noisy inside good spot to study. The only issue is the parking lot. Its small and hard to maneuver but manageable. Im here about once a week and the service, coffee and ambiance is always top notch.</Text>

The fact is that this make a corporation could have gone either way and looked like a McDonald's with loud clown music or a small quaint cafe with jazz music really makes me happy<//text></record>

< Review>
I'd been directed to meet a friend at this "coffee shop." Upon getting there, I realized that the "coffee shop" was actually a Starbucks. Inasmuch as Starbucks is anti-law enforcement, anti-US Armed Forces, anti-Second Amendment, and generally counter-Constitutionally inclined, I contacted my friend, and we agreed to meet elsewhere. It's a nice enough landmark, but it's not a place any self-respecting American would voluntarily frequent.

Not as busy as some of the others in the vicinity, so kind of nice to go there to study or work from time-to-time. Great drive thru service, and for whatever reason, seems to be faster than others. Nice and very friendly staff! Took a star off because it's frequently a little on the dirty side inside.</Review>

I come here all the time and today I came in for a drink before work. It was 8am and I had expected it to be busy, and so I patiently waited in line until my turn. As the person before me was making their order with one of the employees, another basically stomped to the front to take my order. I had politely asked for whatever I wanted to drink, yet the employee taking my order was rude enough to yell at me saying that she couldn't hear what I was saying. The store wasn't that busy and it wasn't that loud for anyone to have to speak up that much. No one else did. I repeat my order and for the second time she misunderstood what I said and I had to correct her, again. She rushed taking my order and I didn't even have the chance to mention I wanted soy milk instead of the regular, until the other employee moved over to register my order on the cash register. When she rushed to make my drink, she ran around as if the ground was on fire and she basically slammed the equipment. Again, it wasn't that busy for her to run around like a machine in overdrive. I've worked at a cafe before having to serve up to 200 guests at the same time and I understand you want to help customers as quickly as possible but doing it with a bad attitude isn't going to help and it was only off-putting. I also understand that stress during rush hours can be hard to disguise but a little smile towards your customers wouldn't hurt. I didn't have to be yelled at, thank you very much.</review>

Ok confession: I'm a Starbucks fan. I have dark roast as my fav. I've never had the foofoo drinks, so can't place a judgement here. I do eat the different breakfast sandwiches on the fly-by. I like them and mostly healthy. Staff is efficient even in rush hours. Always a good restroom.</Review>

Amazing staff, Amazing coffee, the staff makes feel welcome and right at home. There nice, sweet, kind and when or if you come here they will ask how is your day and they will remember your order and they will remember you as well. They also cook the food really good and the place is really clean also. I personally would HIGHLY encourge everyone on coming here. When you come here if feels like all of your stress and probloms have just vanished and they will always put a smile on your face each and everytime.<//review>

<review>Worst Starbucks ever. Refused to remake my drink. Because they dont make it right. I want to drink my coffee, not the water with milk. One of the workers called a police on me and she said that I trew a drink at her and I was drunk. Wich is lies. Police came had no problems passing alcohol test. Will never go there again.< /review><GmapID>0x809b1ef9f3d5b38d:0x7f81b6d8065f764b<//GmapID><user_id>110275029220098459375</user_id><date>1451954632584</date>< name>

Crazy to go to a coffee shop at 11:30 in the morning and they have no dark roast. It is a coffee shop, after all! Starbucks policy is to have dark roast til noon. Another place I won't stop.< /Text>

This place is running on greed. First of all, from the second that I stepped in the lady is being rude. Second of all, for a Mexican restaurant or snack place they give a pretty small portion. Third of all this is the best part, when I wanted to take the rest of the food to go I asked for to go box, she replied we don't hand those out I said why isn't that for to go food she said yeah but it's too expensive. So what do I do with the food I throw the rest away I guess so</text>

<Text>I ordered beef enchiladas beans & rice to go. When I got home after starving all day, my 1st bite was all onions & bell peppers. So I opened the enchilada to find it was all onions & peppers. So I called the restaurant up & asked if in fact I received the correct order and he said yes. So I told the guy I was bringing back that dinner and I wanted to order something different. He hung up on me so I thought maybe it was an accident so I called back & it rang twenty times so I hung up & I called back. No answer. Poor service. I’m telling everyone I know not to go there. I was so disappointed.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809442e91311a99b:0xb491bfe0518856</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>My wife and I really enjoy the food at Arsenio’s. It’s always been one of our favorite places to eat...until the hired a new cashier. The new cashier at Arsenio’s on Shepherd and Cedar does not have customer service skills. She never makes eye contact and she is rude. Whenever I go to pay, I feel unwanted. She is rude and now we don’t like eating here.<//review>< pics>

Beans and rice were flavorless and the entrees were gross, tasted like it came from a can. So disappointed.

<Text>Ordered a smoothie and after I got home I was drinking it and it tasted like plastic 🤢 good thing I live nearby and called them and informed them. The lady at the register insisted that her employee drank the left over smoothie and it didn’t taste like plastic, I said ok well mine did in a nice way and she gave me a refund. I’ve been here before and the food is great but this time makes me not want to go back. Also make sure employees have proper clothing, they look like they’re at the gym.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I would give this place a minus 1 star if i could. The service was really bad the food was even worse than the service. The food tasted like it had been cooked days before and kept in the fridge. I asked for 3 different items on the menu and they didn't have it. Cashier had a bad attitude and was rude.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809442e91311a99b:0xb491bfe0518856< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I used to visit this place on a regular basis but it seems the customer service has gone downhill.  A couple of weeks ago, I ordered a carne asada chipotle bowl to go.  I got it home and it had chicken instead of beef.  I called right away and was told they would give me a credit and write it down for the next time I came in.  I went yesterday to order other food plus pick up my credit.  Instead of a replacement chipotle bowl with carne asada, she handed me a cup of carne asada saying that the only part of the order that was wrong was the meat.  Really?  It's hard to believe they couldn't throw some rice and beans in a bowl with the meat and keep a customer happy.  I've never heard of crediting an order that way.  I decided not to order other food and will not go back.< /Review>< name>

Worst service EVER! The lady seem mad when we showed up. She  overcharged for onion (.50c) and cilantro (.50c)...Crazy! Never seen that before. Love Mexican food, but people like the cashier makes you think twice before stopping by to a Mexican restaurant to eat some of your favorite food. Will Never go back.< /Text>

Ordered flan and they forgot it. Ordered beans and they forgot it ordered tripas and they gave us the wrong meat. This happened twice it was my fault for thinking it was a one time slip up. Also the lady who I called both times was really rude.< /Review>

Cash register lady is always rude. Acts like I'm bothering her for paying them to make food. Food wasn't great either. It's a shame I get better service at a gas station arsenios than at this one. Half star. And the cash register chick should be fired or put in the back. Looking at these comments seems like nobody likes to come here cause of her.<//Text>

Excellent fresh, hot & authentic Mexican food! Breakfast burritos, lunch & dinner meals ALL very good! Restaurant is not much on the ambience (not a romantic date spot) but some really good food including menudo, lengua & REAL home made Mexican favorites. Highly recommend especially if you're looking for good take out!<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><text>The last several times I’ve ordered their chile relleno burrito it’s been sloppily thrown together with very minimal sliced up pieces of pepper and scrambled eggs. I felt robbed paying for something falsely advertised since the relleno wasn’t even an entire stuffed pepper or even half of one in all its sliced up parts... most of the burrito in itself was comprised of rice. Upon speaking with the manager I was equally disappointed being told the owner was the cook who sent it out in that manner. Sadly, it’s been more misses than hits at this location and the benefit of the doubt is long gone. Lesson learned.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Because it's a family business, I'd expect the service to be above average, but service there sucks!!! everyone working there seems unappreciative to take my money,... the bathrooms are disgusting, and the food ain't all that, I know Mexican food, and they ain't fooling me! Not returning again!!<//Text>

<Review>Worst customer service ever! Missing items I had delivered and was hung up on when I said that would defeat the purpose of having it delivered when told I would need to come get missing items. My order was also only half of the size it should and the paper underneath broke up in my food cause it was soggy. Three or out as I couldn’t get around not eating the paper.</Review><GmapID>0x809442e91311a99b:0xb491bfe0518856<//GmapID>< Response>

<Text>This was my first PET scan and I was nervous, up until the moment I walked through their doors. It felt comfortable in my surroundings the staff was was sweet, caring and very helpful. They explain each step and they kept me warm, calm and very cared for. I would give them 10 stars if I could!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had a really good experience today at wave imaging Newport.I had an open MRI and I was really anxious but they let my husband come in and be near me which was wonderful.The two techs who did my MRI were so incredible they were able to calm me and to also make me laugh.They were the BEST!!! The male tech was from the Big Island but I am sorry I didn’t get either of their names.My name is Maureen Miller and I am impressed and would recommend Wave imaging to my friends.Thanks</review>

The imaging center was easy to find off the 55 extension. The staff was friendly and caring. I would’ve given five stars except the chairs were very uncomfortable especially for people needing imaging. Also, I was told to arrive early so by the time my MRI was given 30 minutes late, I had waited almost an hour. MRI Imaging tech was kind, friendly, and good at explaining everything.<//text>

<response>{'time': 1620671873857, 'text': 'Hi Johnny Rodriguez. Thank you for your review; patient feedback is extremely valuable to us. We would like to learn more details about your experience so that we may better serve you. Reply to this message and we will get you in contact with our site manager as soon as possible.'}< /response><pictures>None</pictures><review>My MRI appointment was at 2pm, was asked to arrive at 1:20pm. I arrived right at 1:20pm, filled out paperwork well before 2pm. At 2:15 I got up to ask for an eta, they said the tech was behind and it would be another 20min. I was seen at 2:40pm and was out by 2:55pm. So much for a 2pm appointment. Lastly during the MRI I was NOT given ear buds, I thought maybe this open MRI machine was quieter. When it started it startled me, that is how loud it was. I only endured the noise because I was tired of waiting and wanted to get it over with so that I can get home to my kids. It was so loud that I saw stars during the MRI and started to get anxiety. I managed to make it through, the tech came in, put a trash in front of me and said "you can toss your ear buds in here", I told him that he didn't give me any and his expression said it all. He said "sorry, I messed up, I should have given you some, sorry it's my fault". I pretty much had enough with the place and walked out barely being able to hear and disoriented. I wouldn't suggest going to this place for an MRI unless you want to drive home very disoriented and get home late to your family.<//review>< user_name>

Felt so comfortable during my brain MRI. Was very nervous going into it, but Ardell and the woman working with him (didn’t catch her name) made me feel so much more comfortable! They put on my favorite band, and talked to me periodically during the exam telling me I was doing a good job. Really helped! Thanks guys!< /Text>

The facility is very nice, clean with spacious waiting area. Open MRI unit was not as "open" as one would expect for someone like me who is claustrophobic. Overhead plate is within inches from one's nose!  Technician tried to be helpful, and procedure went fairly quickly--about 30 min. Extremely NOISY compared to other MRI units I've been in. Headphones would be nice!</text>

Went in for a PET scan, the whole scheduling/admin process with Wave Imaging phone personnel (not the same ones at the location) was pretty much a CF, had to call different places, on hold for way too long, people not wanting to take responsibility (“not my department, let me transfer you”), adding to the endless circle/hold. But… that being said, once this was all straightened out and the actual time came for my appointment, the front office staff at the actual imaging place were great and the nurse (Jessie) that hands-on prepped me and then did the scan could not have been more pleasant, easygoing, professional and warm. If not for the in-person staff, this likely would have been a 2 star review. So thanks, on-site staff. Don’t get frustrated with the phone service and give up. If you have to have a PET scan, just know once you get there you’ll be in great hands.<//review>

I had a wonderful experience last week for an MRI, specifically with Freida. Freida was so incredibly kind, reassuring, and communicative. She talked me through each step of the way, got my IV in perfectly the first time, and reassured my nerves throughout the whole process. Overall a very positive experience.< /Text>

I was impressed by how Arlen (Arden?) & Eric treated me & explained each step of the procedure!
Along with the music piped through the headphones (1960’s classic rock), I felt relaxed during the entire procedure!
Keep up the great work!< /text>

<Text>The receptionists were very friendly even at 8am. They greeted me as soon as i walked in. Let me know i had a small wait. When i went in, the tech was so friendly and understanding of my claustrophobia before entering the MRI room and took his time to make me feel comfortable and at ease. He told me about how long my test would take. And asked me if i was ok every chase he could. He also gave me an thing to squeeze If needed to stop (if i ended up having a panic attack) but thanks to the kindness and friendliness of the staff i was comfortable enough to get my MRI done fast and easy.<//Text>< pics>

Had trouble creating my simple cervical spine X-ray series paperwork (30 minutes) and then also exhibited poor communication following my appointment in providing me with a CD of my X-ray.

The African American woman was very friendly and appeared to be learning, the more experienced bald guy in his 30’s was extremely unpleasant and discourteous. Should not be working in healthcare.

He and the confusion at the front desk are the reason for the low score. Again, the technician was super professional and good.<//review></record>

The procedure was quick and easy. Wave imaging is a really nice facility. I got my abdominal ultrasound done by a extremely awesome radiologist who made me feel very comfortable. However, Gabby the  receptionist could use a little training on customer service she really didn’t greet me or look at me. I know people are in a hurry but she really didn’t make me feel to welcome. Other than that I had a great experience.< /Review>

The ultrasound tech was amazing. The front office staff went above and beyond. The scheduler was horrific! An appointment was made at the time of the phone call to schedule the appointment the man who scheduled the appointment confirmed the doctors orders. By the time of the appointment 8 hours later and fasting no one could find the order. They can’t run any tests without a doctors order and now it’s after office hours. I was able to get a doctor on the line and the front office took a verbal order from him. Leaving barely enough time to complete the ultrasound. The tech worked diligently and efficiently to get it complete. Amazing job by all but the person who made the appointment. He seemed to be incompetent.<//review>

After going to a different WaveImaging facility on the previous day and being unable to complete my MRI due to extreme claustrophobia, I was referred to their location in Newport Beach that had an open-ended device. From my first call to Leslie — which was handled with extreme professionalism , thru and including the procedure with Frieda and Jay, the experience overall was absolutely phenomenal. Frieda was gentle and kind, and offered me numerous options from which to choose in order to facilitate the most easeful experience. It was over, as promised, within 15 minutes. If you are ever in need of an MRI and your prescribing physician can get the necessary images from an open end MRI, then WaveImaging in Newport Beach is the place for you!<//Text>

Had an MRI taken Monday afternoon.  All went well, the staff was very courteous and friendly, and the procedure was the easiest MRI I’ve had.  Would highly recommend!< /text>

<Text>I went in for an MRI.  Did I tell you I hate MRI's? The team @Wave were outstanding.  They made me comfortable and keep me in the loop thru the enter procedure.

I was very pleased with the professionalism and the quickness that they got to me and take care of my situation. I have an appointment with my doctor 10 o’clock Monday so they provided me a CD or DVD whatever that is so he can view the x-rays I was very happy about that. Very professional and very happy.< /review>

Both times I’ve gone there, I’ve arrived early as requested and they still can’t seem to get me signed in, paperwork completed and back to the testing area within 30 minutes of my scheduled appointment. They don’t seem to really care too much about patients.... they’re just doing the minimum to get by. There’s patients there with walkers, who struggle to get up and down, and they call them up to the desk over and over.... no real empathy or connection with patients...<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

On time for my appointment as were several other patients. Imaging center opened 20 minutes late with one employee sitting in the lobby.

<Text>We had checked in before our appointment and completed all the information. We were 5 minutes before our appointment and there were 2 people before us for check in.  We reached the front desk and noted our name and time at our appointment time at 1.30. As the  front desk was backed up it took them 8 minutes before the called us.

After they took our insurance and id information again we were told that we were late and missed our time slot.

After arguing with supervisor, she told us that we mees to come 20 minutes before our appointment and they may be able take us if someone doesn't show up for following appointment.

After waiting another 30 minutes they took us. It literally took 5 minutes for the ultrasound and there was so much time and efforts to get there.

This is the last time we are going to wave imagining.<//Text>< Pics>

Clean, visible safety precautions and knowledgeable & kind staff.  I don’t like needles and my tech was very kind and accommodating to my needs.  Made me feel comfortable and checked that I was ok multiple times during the procedure.

I will go back there anytime I need a CT Scan or other imaging tests.<//Review>

This facility was easy to find and really clean/beautiful inside. The front office team was very polite and helpful with the questions I had about my MRI.

The techs I had were amazing! I am so scared and claustrophobic of these machines, but they talked me through the whole thing and made me feel better.

I realize they have to do this everyday, and to have techs that understand your concerns and make you feel better is just amazing, and frankly hard to come by nowadays.

Thanks Newport team!< /text>

<review>I was not looking forward at getting a mri. However, if you have to get one, go to Waveiimaging. The lobby is very comfortable and clean. The best part is the staff. Everyone is cheerful and helpful. The young man that did the mri was so very nice and made an unpleasant procedure comfortable. He was pleasant and very,, very  nice.<//review>< time>

<text>I recently had a CT Scan at this imaging facility in Newport Beach. It was a very good experience when the staff were professional and courteous. Best of all, I did my scan without much wait time.

The large waiting room let me relax about the COVID-19 distance warnings. I was called after 10 minutes of waiting.. The technician explained everything very clearly. I waited after the procedure to get a copy of the image on a DVD. This service is free and fast. Other imaging centers, like those affiliated with Mission Hospital, don't provide that and make you fill up a form and come back later to pick it up.

The parking was free and easy to use.
The only negative part was perhaps the location of the office in Newport Beach. Getting out of the city in rush hours is very challenging. You might want to get someone to drive for you after the service.<//text>< pictures>

First time having to go to this location and I was very happy with my care. Memorial Care customer service, check in process and throughout my appt-it was excellent.From the first encounter thru to the end of my appointment, the staff and technician were caring and professional. Also I was very glad to see all the precautions to keep everyone safe. Thank you and I will definitely return to this location in Newport Beach.</Review>

It was an easy check in Process with little to no wait time. The MRI technician asian male was very kind, considerate and explained the process in detail and included an Emergency button incase I needed to stop the process. That type of care goes beyond exceptional Service, speaks volumes and in my experience are very well trusted to recommend to friends, families amd loved ones. Thank you Newport MemorialCare Imaging!!!!< /review>

<text>This was a surprisingly satisfying experience. I don’t know what I really expected, but I found the Imaging Center to be VERY comfortable and stylish. That is secondary to how efficient and professional and personable every member of the staff was, from the front desk registration to the escort to the changing room to Jesse, the radiology technician who made sure everything went smoothly. Truly awesome.
Thank you to the entire staff.</text>< Pictures>

Very accommodating! The actual check in and MRI process was amazingly smooth and quick. You get to choose music and my technician seemed like he really enjoyed his job! It went really quick and I love the open air MRI!

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the Physical Therapy (Newport Care & emere) employees were not wearing masks. How can you tell people they have to wear face coverings, but your medical professionals don't? In a pandemic, masks should be worn. If I had to go to that side, I probably would have just left. The receptionist on the PT side was on their phone for at least 10 minutes. The phone I'd excuse, the endangerment and disregard for people coming in for treatment is inexcusable.<//text>

I have been to 2 different Radnet sites and they are all wonderful but Newport Beach was amazing. So clean with a spa like atmosphere, it really calmed my nerves. The MRI tech was so so kind, patient and accommodating that I got over my claustrophobia and got the the whole scan. 5 stars all the way!<//text>

< review>
Miy PET and CT scan was very professionally done I was amazed at the knowledge and skill and  customer care focus of the entire organization from the reception desk on to the actual nurse practitioner who was running the equipment so I could not be happier. I was provided with all of the information. I knew what was going on when it was going on why it was going on so I want to thank everyone involved thank you.</review>

This is a great place to go. But during this pandemic I accompanied my mother to her appointment and anyone can walk in. No one is asked any health questions or had their temperature taken before coming in. Chairs are very close to each other, social distancing is not required. Never felt so unsafe for myself and mother at a hospital no less.<//review>

<Text>It has been an hour and a half since my scan was over and my doctor says that the images were not sent (even though my paperwork indicates that it should be sent “stat”. It even says that the scan center should Call him immediately with results and that hasn’t happened either. I have no idea how long this will take to clear up. On the other hand I should point out that the nurses who helped me were very professional and competent.<//Text>< name>

Memorial care facilities are new to me.  I have been here two times and have had very pleasant experience.  The first time, I had an appointment and had a bit of a wait.  The second time, I went as a walk in and was in and out within 30 minutes.<//review>

<Text>This was a great experience for the patient’s. It was clean quiet, and the staff was very helpful, and knowledgeable! I thank you, Donna Graham
I was surprised the entrance, and there were two, did not have a disabled door to enter, or exit! It’s was difficult for a lady, pushing the  patient, in a wheelchair! I feel this should be addressed, they have handicap parking, and ramps, but no easy access in, or out of there building. 3300 West Coast Hwy Newport Beach< /Text>< Rating>

Yesterday, I visited Memorial Care Imaging for a routine x-ray.  With only a few people in the waiting room, I anticipated a relatively brief wait.  Unfortunately, the wait ended up being nearly 1 hour. During that time, a number of patients entered after me and were admitted ahead of me. It became apparent that the business lacked the processes necessary to ensure patient processing efficiency and that the desk staff was not supervised properly (if at all) to do so. I certainly hope that the business will take action to address these issues immediately.< /text>

<Review>The person who I spoke with (Jimmy) to get my appointment was VERY RUDE.
When so ask for a supervisor, I was placed on hold and the. Told she was on another phone call but would call me back! That was 10 days ago, still no one has called me back.
When I arrived to check in the girl in reception was demeaning and sarcastic. Hopefully I won’t be going back!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

My neurologist ordered an MRI and the hospital was way too expensive. Memorial care helped me with a cash price and quick appointment setup. The procedure was quick and easy. They have an open MRI and explain everything. I would recommend memorialcare and the Newport Beach location.< /Text>

<Text>From checking in, the front desk reception for imaging was very kind and pleasant. My technician Jessica was also very nice and patient with the type of imaging that was required as I tend to be body shy. They also provided the images to me on a CD to take home for
my records. Overall a really great experience and I would come back if more images are required of me.</Text></record>

I went on Saturday July 11th and found the empty and quiet waiting room to be very helpful as well!! This was my very first MRI and I had very high anxiety which both staff personnel gave me information which  helped me calm down!! The “open” machine is also a GREAT bonus here!

The open MRI machine is like a queen size bed.  Have used 3 Tesla model in the past, this made all the difference in a 5 star rating and a sub 1 star rating.  There was an issue with scheduling and running behind but they spent extra time on me ad well.<//Text>

There's nothing all that unusual about a couple of ultrasounds.  The tech (I missed her name in her mask) was nice and easy.

What was special was that they took me early so that the bladder that I'd filled for the ultrasound was relieved more quickly.  Thank you!< /Text>

The office is clean and everyone is wearing a mask and is following the social distancing of 6 ft. The staff that helped me were very kind and patient with me especially since I have claustrophobia. They waited for me to relax before doing my MRI. The gal that did the imaging was a kind,  sweet,  understanding, young Filipina gal.  She helped me get through it as fast as she could.  Definitely would use their open MRI imaging center again.<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I had to get an MRI done recently and my insurance/primary care physician sent me here. They told me they had a more open machine which is better for people who are claustrophobic. The staff here was incredibly kind and helpful, everyone from the receptionist to the techs working the machine, very professional and made the whole thing super easy.

If you have to have an MRI done, bring good earplugs. It does get loud and can be jarring at times, but the bed they lay you on is very comfortable and the whole thing was over in about 20 minutes or so in my situation. There is also a mirror above your head at an angle that reflects the rest of the room, and as small as it is, believe me it helps. Being able to feel air from both sides of the larger machine is great too, you don't feel trapped.

To the staff here, thank you for your professionalism and courteousness. It's very much appreciated. If you're debating on where to get a test such as this done, don't think twice, this place is where you want to go if it's an option for you.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

I would like to publicly acknowledge Frida my MRI technician for her comforting bedside manner. I’m very claustrophobic and she was so thoughtful and reassuring the whole time I was in the tube. I’m so grateful she was there to help keep me calm and get through it as painlessly as possible.<//Text>

As accommodating and  professional as can be. I didn’t properly introduce myself to the tech who assisted me. A young woman who could not have made my MRI any easier. She did a couple things that got me through the day.  Bedside manner was a solid 10.
The facility itself is top notch, starting with location and parking. Big open waiting area and calm environment.
Thank you.<//Text>

<UserId.>114949227992768350955<//UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I got a message from scheduling yesterday that they forgot to do my pre-registration questions. I called at 4:45 last night. They told me that since I was taking hormone replacement medications for my cancer that I could not come in for my MRI that was scheduled for today. The scheduler told me that he needed to reschedule me for three weeks and to stop taking my medication. What the heck? A scheduler telling me to stop taking my cancer medication? That should’ve been my first red flag. At this point it was too late to call my oncologist and this isn’t my first rodeo so I told him to talk to talk to a supervisor. He came back and said it should be fine just come tomorrow for the MRI. Really? So, at this point it was too late to call my oncologist to confirm that I could proceed with my appointment and I chalked it up to the fact that the scheduler was an incompetent. After the MRI I always get the results. The MRI technician told me that the radiologist was not available and did not have my previous MRI results to make a comparison. So I left not knowing if I have cancer again. I called my oncologist immediately and unfortunately he doesn’t have time to talk to me today and may call me tomorrow. So now I wait.< /Text>< Name>

While the front desk staff and ultra sound tech was great, I don not recommend going here. In fact I highly recommend going elsewhere because they are no taking temperatures at the door, and they are not requiring mask or social distancing. RadNet clearly doesn't care about it's patients or staff.<//text>

<Review>My MRI lasted more than 2 hours, unnecessarily. The pictures where not coming out good but the person did not stop and ask for assistance. After half an hour or more she did so and had to repeat the fist step again. After a while it bacame extremely hot and uncomfortable in the machine. My appointment was scheduled for 3 pm and I left the center ar 5:30 pm. The person who took care of me was nice bit don't seem to have much experiente with imaging.</Review>< name>

I was seen at the Memorial imaging center in Newport Beach in May I believe and was charged a copay. That is supposed to be refunded to me which it hasn't. I have called seven times now and have never been given an answer as to why my refund has not processed. I have asked for managers which have never called me back. It is UNBELIEVEABLE, the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever dealt with. I would never go to them again.<//text>

Beautiful facility. Very clean and efficient. The technician doing my ultrasound was so very nice and helpful. I would highly recommend coming here… They were able to get me in almost the next day and because of worrisome health problems I so appreciated this.</review>

Great service...thank you so much for making it enjoyable. The receptionists were polite and kind they even have me Oreos on my way out. Thank you Ladies for the snack it saved me...
The technicians were very professional always asking if I was comfortable and let them know if I wasn't feeling right about the process.
Thanks again.
I have had many scan at many centers and this is the best. Not going anywhere else for now on

<Review>The Newport Beach facility on PCH was clean and the decor was welcoming. Staff was very pleasant and helpful in answering my questions. They explained everything in detail and processed my paperwork quickly. The x-ray tech was nice, asked questions about my condition, and explained everything so I had a good understanding of what to do and what to expect. My visit was quick and easy. I especially liked the patient portal option to access my records online.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I am so glad I was referred to this imaging center. They coordinated seemelessly with my doctor's office, and my basic info form was already completed,  and waiting for me when I arrived. The staff is very professional and i was seen promptly for my scan. I would not hesitate to recommend them to a friend or family member.< /text>

I had an issue with my insurance giving inaccurate information, and Geena, at the front desk went out of her way to call my insurance and insist that they recheck their records. Her doing that allowed me to get the X-ray I needed according to my plan. The X-ray tech was kind and delightful to work with. I highly recommend West Coast Radiology.< /Text>

I had a great experience at memorial care imagining center for a CT scan. The building itself was beautiful, accommodating lobby and the staff was very friendly. The technician who did my CT was so personable and professional, she made me feel at ease. Also they have a really nice locker room area where you can get changed and have your things safety secured. It felt like a spa more than a medical office!<//Text>

Had MRI, CT Scan, and X-ray, everyone was so nice and helpful and they got me through everything quickly. The availability for appointment was really good. The office was building a new Addition MRI so they had GE MRI on a cool trailer, though that that was really cool to be able to move such a huge magnet that always needs electricity to cool the superconductors though it was amazing that they could make it mobile.< /Text>

<Text>The gentleman who was doing the scan was very accommodating, I was having some anxiety issues and they gave me other options like going into the MRI feet first and letting me wear reflector glasses so I can see outside of the tube. I was then relaxed and the MRI was smooth and easy.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Staff at this location is absolutely Lovely, Dominic is so sweet sympathetic and very caring just made my heart happy 😊 same with T  she was very careful and cared about my mother. I Love this facility better than FV although I Love Dr Cooper I just don’t like the changes they made at FV it’s very generic and feel like just a number when you walk in the door at FV.<//Review>

The staff and especially the lab technician were all very helpful and informative. Thanks guys! You definitely need some better signage for the back entrance. I almost got lost because it looks like the road ended before your driveway.</Review>

Was having awful right kidney pain and Huntington Beach location of OC Urgent care referred me to this facility.  Was easy for me to get to from Irvine to West Coast Hwy, park and get into the building.  Inside lobby well marked and the ladies at the check-in desk were very nice, helpful and took care of me pretty fast after listening to my painful story.   Had x-rays 1st, then ultrasound imaging of the kidney area and the bladder 2nd, was pretty easy and I was very impressed and most definitely would use this facility again and recommend it even if it's not around the corner from your home.< /Review>

I arrived 20 minutes before my appointment (CT scan) which was scheduled for 8:45 am. I was not called for my scan until 9:35 - almost an hour after my scheduled appointment. This is inconsiderate, unprofessional and unacceptable. What good is having an appointment - you certainly don't seem to care about honoring it.
I was also told that my doctor requested a dvd of the session and I was to wait for it which took another 20 minutes. I have been to other testing facilities which transmit this kind of thing electronically to my doctor.
In any case, I will NEVER return to your facility again for tests. If my experience is any indication you have no respect for your clients.<//Text>

2-28-2020 Again, this time we are at Memorial care at Newport beach and the same issue at Irvine. We got here at 9:40 and my mother gets in at 11:20 for her MRI. The excuse was there is a problem with a patient and we have to wait but then other people after her were going for MRI!!!
After we complained that she was here before these people, the technician came after 10 minutes and asked us few questions like we came from another world and we don't understand why we are here, very rude. Then he said why my mother has her purse and her neck Protection still on. I told him no one took us inside and asked her to get ready for MRI!!! What is going on???
But at least because of all the excuses, they did Ultrasound first at 10:55 and then MRI.
Why these people don't train to respect people. I'm wondering if they took their mother and they treated like this, do they bother to change their attitude!!! Hope they do.< /Review>

This location has some awesome people people feom the love ladues greeting me at the front desk, calming me down and directing me to rhe correct location. Needleas to say Ms. FREDA was one of the most humble, compassionate and empathetic person i have encountered during my medical issues. Without these i would've never completed this appointment.</review>

The facility is quite large and airy inside and I did not have any difficulty finding comfortable seating to wait in. The staff were very knowledgeable and efficient snd the surroundings were very bright and clean.  The only challenge was parking so arrive a touch early to account for that.</text>

<text>Fortunately I was able to get an appointment quickly for a MRI. The receptionist was great, letting me know they were behind schedule and I would have to wait. Much better than sitting in the waiting room.
The technician was also great. He explained everything in great detail, gave me earphones with music and made me feel very comfortable. The time went by quickly.<//text><gmap_id>0x80dd2007d63bccf9:0x6716180ef17d3c24<//gmap_id>< name>

This was my first time at this location.  The place is clean and relaxing.  I enjoyed the gentle music as I waited. My appointment was at 8:00 A.M. I was seen four minutes later.  The staff is professional and friendly.  It was a very relaxing and pleasant experience.< /Text>

The Front desk personnel was phenomenal. Ability plus great attitudes! Always a winning program. Your staff are all on point!  The service was efficient and followed all protocol required.  If I ever require any imaging... Memorial Care Imaging will be my GO TO!< /Text>

<Review>The facility is clean, modern and lovely. Parking was easy. Check in was quick and efficient and impersonal. Where is the warm greeting and nice smile? The CT procedure went fine. The only complaint I have is that the tech could have slowed down and explain the steps so that I could prepare mentally.< /Review>< user_id>

When I arrived and went to speak to the woman at the front desk she was  helpful and kind. The waiting room was very pleasant with plenty of space and chairs and coffee and water were made available. My waiting time was menamel.  The imaging Tech who assisted me was friendly and well suited to my personality. She made me very comfortable and again my time was minimal .  My experience was nice. As I was leaving I walked back to the front desk to ask to extend my gratitude to everyone. I was feeling very anxious when I first arrived and I was calmed quickly by all of these factors.<//review>

Had forgotten my HSA credit card and they forced me to re schedule because you need to pay BEFORE. the service. I offered them to take reference of another credit card until I phone them or come back with my HSA credit card . They refused. Poor customer service / customer focus. And not aligned with other Memorial center policy where I always paid after the service.</Text>

< Review>
OMGOODNESS! Everybody if you haven't been down to have your MRI done at Memorial care Imaging in Newport Beach at 3300 coast hwy. You have to see this thing, it really open, not scary at all. You are met with the front staff who are very kind, the entrance is Spanish style, like I'm going into a nice restaurant. The Techs greet you, such beautiful auchetichure in the whole building, changing rooms are very pleasant, waiting area with nice furniture to wait on, awesome TV to watch. Then, the MRI, it's a beast in its own right. Very open, very clean, huge white machine, band new, the girls said they only have had this one for about six months or so. I have had to indure a lot of MRI and by far this is rated a 20 from 1 to 10 scale!!! Just have to see it for yourself!<//Review>

The receptuinist(s) are very nice and professional. My wait time was reasonable and I was actually brought into the MRI room earlier than my scheduled time. The tech engaged me in conversation other than my medical reasons. Very human.< /Review>

I have a great experience at Memorial Care Imaging Center in Newport Beach. The place is beautiful and super clean. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable and the barium I had to swallow actually tasted good believe it or not! I highly recommend this facility<//Text>

Upon arriving, I was asked to sign in and have a seat. 15 minutes later I was called to provide ID and insurance card and Dr. order. Another 15 minute wait. Was given a form or two to complete, then another 10 minute wait before I was called back. X-rays (six) took under 10 minutes. I was told there would be a 15 minute wait for the CD of the x-ray-surprisingly it only took a couple of minutes...

Although the enormous waiting area had only two other patients, I had to wait over 40 minutes for my x-rays. I watched for droves of finished patients leaving but only saw one. Not sure why the wait was so long-when I asked, I was told, “We have a lot of x-rays today.”<//review>

<text>I was there to bring my daughter for an MRI. I was given the phone number to the office in HB, the first available appointment was in Newport. My appointment was at 8:00am, I arrived 6 min late. I tried calling to let them know  I was going to be late, however I was out on hold so long that I was still on hold when I arrived. Once I arrived I was addressed by a front office person, then referred to “Connie” who was so rude to me. Connie told me I was supposed to arrive 20 min prior to my appointment, which I was not told. Instead of being compassionate to the circumstances, in addition to the traffic at 8:00.  After telling me to have a seat and coming back after 5 min she shoved papers in my face and asked me to complete, I gave her my co pay which was a check from my daughters father as grabs papers from my hands and when I asked what was wrong she got even more rude in tone and mannerisms. I work with patients also all day, there are unavoidable situations all the time, It never gives anyone the right to be rude or abrasive.< /text>< gmap_id>

Memorial Care Imaging’s Newport Beach office made my potentially uncomfortable test (a hip arthrogram) so easy!
Everyone from the Reception Staff to the Technical Staff to the Radiologist were efficient, knowledgeable, friendly, and comforting!</review>

Outstanding client service. They were very helpful to squeeze me in to a busy schedule and called me to offer me an earlier appointment when one became available. Their front desk staff and technicians are outstanding. I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

The place was wonderful! Totally clean even the male/female restroom.

My imaging person was so nice.  She was able to help me or talk me through the MRI and that us a feat in itself!

Thank you<//text>

<review>I really liked the memorial care imaging center. Everyone one was very nice and efficient, I didn’t wait very long and the woman who did the procedure was very friendly and quick. Coffee at the end was good and much appreciated after fasting 😊

<Text>I only wish I could give them a score of less than one.  They lost my Doctor's orders, and even though they called me fifteen times to tell how much my MRI would cost, they neglected to give me some critical information that prevented me from completing my visit.  TERRIBLE customer service and a "dont care" attitude from the staff< /Text>< rating>

<review>Very fast and easy check in, friendly staff, and gorgeous waiting area.  Only downfall is that the waiting room is connected to urgent care.  If you are at urgent care and need imaging that’s awesome, but if you are just there for imaging, it’s a bummer because you are waiting with lots of coughing and sick people.  My tip would be to park in the back and enter on that side which is closer to the imaging waiting area.  Otherwise everything was great!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Would go four stars, but not fair because it’s not for the facility, service or people’s attitudes, which were great. Check in desk was friendly and attentive and MRI tech was very accommodating and concerned with my comfort. Facility is clean and modern. My negative feedback is more about the lack of eco consciousness with the free coffee and water station with horrible styrofoam cups, wasteful Keurig Coffee and those wasteful plastic coffee pucks and then the small plastic water bottles (when there is a water fountain in the lobby!). Just put paper water cups next to the fountain if your clients are too precious. Really a poor environmental choice for a Newport Beach facility (banned styrofoam 10 years ago) and no need for coffee for MRI patients who are in and out with plenty of coffee close by. Reduce your waste please.< /Text>

I had to give it a star to proceed but honestly it’s not worth even that!  The tech was nice but all the others were rude it’s as if there time was more valuable then mine.  I was asked to be there 15-20 min early why ???  To be treated rude!  I was there and still had to wait past my appt time to be seen.  The sad part is they weren’t even busy.<//Text>

<Text>After visiting the Memorial Care Faciliy on Barance for an MRI on my knee .... What a difference.... I am very claustrophobic and came with NOT very high hopes to get through this .. Not only was your Technician great and put my mind at easy (I did take Valium, which also helped), this procedure was so much more pleasant ... I would most definitely recommend you ... For myself, I would chose this MemorialCare, without a doubt, anytime I would have a need for one.< /Text></record>

The staffs are very nice. Special thank to Chelsea and Phil were very nice with me. They  made me feel comfortable. Chelsea called me before an appointment and remind me the procedure. She also showed me how to get there. Phil, he was very patient to explain everything and went thru one by one step with me during the procedure. He also checked oftently if I was ok. Great job guys! Bravo 😀👍<//Review>

The MRI procedure was fine. The problem for me was billing and copay. A copay was required at the facility. I paid and now my insurance says I am due a refund. I tried to submit this information. The receptionist was extremely curt, sharp and flat out rude. Customer service was not helpful. She wanted some “OMB#? All I had was a receipt and insurance cards.
Billing department is not available to talk to. All in all, go to Hoag hospital for your MRI. I had no trouble speaking with a rep. She took my secondary insurance # and is going to mail out a refund. Speaking to Memorial Care AIC Newport representative was a nightmare and nothing was resolved.</Review>

<review>Shady business. If you have never even been to their facility and you miss an appointment, they will bill you. I understand that once you have been to a doctor and have signed an agreement then they can bill you for a missed appointment but not if you've never signed an agreement or even walked in their doors then you can't bill someone.

Cash patient walked in with an order from a cardiologist. 15 pages of nonsense that no one will ever read later I was put into the queue To get my scheduled 5 minute test done..I wouldn’t call it efficient and I hope you are adequately protected for me as that seem to be the main goal< /text>

I was scheduled for an MRI of my wrist. The technician created so much pain in my hand trying to put my wrist in place and while in the MRI tube. Also he shoved my fractured elbow the direction he wanted my arm to go which created a lot of pain. He was trying to be too fast & instead hurt people worse.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>if you want to do MRI here please do yourself a favour and Don't go to this place cause you would see lots of hassling.
My wife and i have done more than 10 MRI last 5 years in this place. it used to be great facility when lisa was working there. these days i think they hire new people who don't know how to do their job. i called a week ago and emphasied  that i would do my MRI in a week on this facility and just want to make sure that get my authorization before my appointment. usually in the past they got in 2 days maximum.  After waiting for 7 days just the day before my appointment  i called the office and asking about my approval. they told me we would call you in the afternoon. they didn't call me and i had to call them again .they said we couldn't get hold of your Doctor . my question is what you were doing the whole week that you had to call the doctor in last minutes . i said ok and reschedule my time to 3 day after . today(friday) i called again cause supposedly i have an appointment on Monday  still i don't know if i have appointment  for Monday morning or not. have to reschedule my orthopedic surgeon for second time and wait 2 more weeks.
very unprofessional and bad customer service for loyal patient !!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>
