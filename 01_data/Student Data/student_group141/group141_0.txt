<Rate>4</Rate><Review>Good Indian food. Not very spicy or oily. Only street parking but far away for prime La Jolla area , so you should be able to find one . Good amount of seating and they have buffet for lunch. I went with my team once for buffet and it was reasonable with good amount of options. We typically order  pick-up using Eat24 for dinner. As with any Indian restaurant there are a lot of vegetarian options .</Review>< pics>

<text>Over rated place. worst making of Indian food, very less options. I ate dinner buffet and almost all items are previous days. Management is not good,  not helpful and amenities are not clean and unhygienic. If you want to try good Indian food please please don't choose this place.

Finally if you don't have any idea about how Indian food is and wanna give a try for the first time my sincere advice is don't start with this place.</text>< rate>

I was very disappointed in the quality of the food.  Although the curry had a decent flavor - the sauce was watery, the quality of the chicken was poor and rubbery and the vegetables that came in the curry had obviously come from a bag in the freezer.  The only thing I liked was the naan.  That said, the staff was kind and our take out order was ready exactly on time.< /review>

<Text>Wonderful food and great prices.
Me and my wife ordered food online at yelp's eat24 (rice, curry prawns and butter chicken), waited around 30 minutes and it got very delicious food plus we paid around $35 and ate it for 2 days :)</Text>< Pictures>

It is low key more like a cheap kafe but the food is acceptable. It is the only indian place coles to the beach in the area. So if you are into indian food or gluten free, dairy free diet, this is a decent option. The price was 13.99 for lumb-rice dishes.< /review>

<Review>Wish I could give zero stars. Awful customer service. I ordered a to-go dinner over the phone and was told it would be ready in 25 min. I went to pick up after 45 min and to my surprise it was not ready yet. I had to wait addituona 15 minutes and when I asked him the reason he says- "we are busy."
That was a huge lie because there were hardly any people in the restaurant.
I go back home to be surprised again- the bread which I ordered are extremely crispy and very hard to eat. And the biryani tastes terrible. Never in my life I'll go to this place and I encourage people reading my review not to go here. There are other indian restaurants which are way better than this.< /Review>< user_id>

Lunch Buffet was of very poor quality. Tandoori Chicken was too much dry and just had colour without any spices; It doesn't smell fresh also. Other items also didn't had proper masala in it.<//Review>

Worst indian food place ....overrated. Does not even deserve one star.The butter Chicken tastes like an amateur 10 year old made it .The Tikka is so wrong that's it's not even how to make it.And guaranteed stomach upset for the entire family . I rushed to the CVS pharmacy in La jolla the next morning for diarrhea pills.Ruined our dinner and sleep .Very unhygienic place.< /text>

Horrible food! took a friend to experience authentic Indian food and this was by far from authentic. Ordered Chicken tikka massala which is basic and common dish and they ruined it. Some lady in the back was asking if her dish had gluten and the waiter said "i dont know i cant communicate with the chefs because they are Mexican and they only speak Spanish".  absolutely no tatse what so ever DO NOT GO HERE!<//review>

Incredible Indian food, right here in LJ.  We've been all over the world, and even in London the Chicken Tikka did not compare to Tandoori Chef.  I can only assume negative reviews are from their competitors - we order from here several times per week.< /Review>

I only come here for Dina - as long as she works here, I will keep coming. They also speak Vietnamese and don’t have a ton of colors to choose from, but it doesn’t bother me because Dina does good quality, professional and clean. She is very detailed and makes sure to get the right shape. These 5 stars are to Dina!</text>

Went in for a simple manicure, came out and my nails looked like a 4-year old did them. They weren't even filed straight. They were crooked and it looked like I got them done weeks ago rather then minutes ago. The staff was rude and the place is dirty. Polishes were VERY OLD with little selection. I obviously wouldnt recommend at all.< /text>

Im giving two stars because its my fault I didn’t call to say i was late. I got lectured the moment I walked in for being late and then was given the new girl. An hour and a half later my pedicure was finished and my toe nails are awful! Absolutely awful. I loved this place the first time but this time was soooo bad. I never post reviews but this was just ridiculous. Paint on my actual toes, clumps in my polish, crooked nails, and no time spent on the extras like massage and scrubs and paraffin. I should have said something but I needed to leave. This was just embarrassing to even walk out with and a complete waste of 40.00.< /Text>

<review>I called in and scheduled an appointment for 6/25/16 at 4pm. I wanted a full set of fiberglass nails and was told it was $28 for the set. Everyone seemed nice there but I felt rushed, I got there 15 minutes before my appointment time so that I could look at the different styles/polish. I was there maybe two minutes and I was called back. I was still deciding and the guy was trying to do my nails and kept asking what I wanted, I told him that I am not sure yet. He then took a deep breath as if he was annoyed with me. I finally decided on a French tip style with blue and white. I won't keep this going so I will cut to it. My nails did not look like they should have for the price ($45 just for nails) they were uneven and you can still see the previous polish I had on my nails on the sides. Today I had to file my nails so they look even and get the length I repeatedly told him I wanted. Oh and $22 to get my toes polished just polished. Rant over! Not going there again!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I scheduled an appt a day in advance then I get a phone call the day of the appointment I have to cancel due to non emergency. No other options given the technician ask me to call the following week, I called for a Friday appt "I'm busy"   what happened to customer service? Their management really need to look into improving customer service.< /review>

<Text>I love this place. I've been coming here for over 15 years. It's affordable, clean and my nail guy John is the best ever!!! My nails always look amazing and he never nicks my fingers (like other salons have *cough cough* the one in sunrise mall). As long as John works here I'll always get my nails done here.</Text>< user>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Had a great experience here following a terrible experience at the salon directly across from z nails. Came in without an appointment with my husband to see if we could get pedis. They accommodated us and we were treated wonderfully. They took a really long time with the pedis which was awesome, my husband actually fell asleep! We will definitely be coming back, this time with appointment.< /Review><Response>None</Response><time>1528971538449</time>< Pictures>

<Text>I got an acrylic fill with gel polish. All of my nails are bumpy and shaped wrong. None of them match at all. Very uneven and crooked with large lumps. There are huge areas where she didn't file the acrylic on the edges of my nails, the points aren't even centered they're crooked to  one side. The place was almost completely empty the whole time i was there, so it wasn't like she had to rush through them. I've never left a salon wanting to go get my nails done somewhere else immediately after.  I won't go back again!!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Very upset, Z Nails doesn't even deserve the one star I had to give to put this post up. They caused my daughter age 22 to cry. We went to get acrylic fill with gel color overlay.  They proceeded to complete the fill with fiberglass, even after being asked if it was acrylic both guys said yes. I couldn't contain myself, especially after she showed me her fill and they did not look all the same shape, nor did it look like they had been filled. I asked WHY do you have it labeled fiberglass if it is ACRYLIC. He said, o fiberglass better, it stronger. So I asked if they charge for broken nails.  I personally do not like fiberglass it is NOT as strong for me. He looked at me like I was crazy, but said yes, free.  ALL my nails are very flat, no arch, I like the arch that they normally make. We personally will NOT go back.</Text>

<Text>The ladies there are super friendly and go out of their way to provide excellent service. I just had a quick manicure with nail polish for a very reasonable price but the lady taking care of me could not have been any nicer. She checked in with me every step to see if I was, ok, and while I was putting on my shoes she checked the polish would not get ruined. The place is very clean.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Disappointing to say the least. I've been here twice, just to give a fair chance. Both times were lacking. The first time i got the top tier pedicure and acrylic fill with gel overlay.
My pedicure was super fast, and I don't think i would even call what i received a massage. She basically tickled my legs.
My fill wasn't too bad m, but it wasn't what i wanted. She did change the shape of my nails and took out the arch that was there.
The second time I received a fill- acrylic with gel overlay, and it was awful. The gal didn't take off all the old color before she applied the acrylic even when I asked her 3 times to get it off.
She changed the shape of every nail and they are not the same. Some are squaval, some are round. She did a repair and didn't shape it well at all, bot only is it square it's a big hump of acrylic that looks ridiculous. The gel color doesn't even coat the whole nail and there is such a huge definition between my acrylic and cuticle it looks like it wasn't smoothed out and I need a fill already.
The staff is not the friendliest either. When I arrived, a man asked me "What do you want?"  They often carry on in their own conversations and seem to pay little interest in client expectations for services entail.
I won't be going back.</Review>

I got a full acrylic set with gel polish on the Saturday the first of July. It's now Saturday the 7th and 2 of my nails have already fallen off! This is ridiculous I paid 50 for these nails and they are completely horrible I do not recommend this place to anyone!!</Text>

< Review>
This place was awful!! Not my usual nail place, but thought i might try it. I went in on a Thursday about 1 pm. for a gel manicure. There were 4 nail techs and not a single customer. One nail tech got up to help me. She started my manicure, but then another customer came in she got up without saying a word to me about what she was doing and went over to help the customer who had walked in the door. One of the othet techs came over to finish my manicure, but seemed very upset to have her conversation with another tech interrupted. She was rude and unprofessional to say the least. I was so uncomfortable by her demeanor that i just wanted to get out of there! I paid but  left without having her finish my nails. This place is awful! If i could have given it less than a star i would have.< /Review>

<review>Worst service ever I asked for a design and they made it awful I asked for them to do it again and they got angrey and didn’t do it at all, it’s much better to do it yourself to ever go here waste of money, gas, and time. Please do not waste your money here they have 0 patience.</review>< pics>

The people were nice. However I spent $60 for a gel manicure and pedi and walked out with my nails looking like they had been done over a week ago because my full nail wasnt done, and my pedi only lasted a week.</review>

I was going there for a while and then I found someone way better with trendier style and when I returned to get my eyebrows done I could sense that Lynn was upset and did a poor job on my brows. I will never go there again!!!!!</Review>

We stopped by At this gas station and witness the counter lady being racist. There  there is a couple of Hispanic construction workers there along with A white  construction worker pumping gas.  The counter lady made a  disturbing comment to the white construction worker. She told him to get his co-workers out of there, that those kind of ppl didn’t belong in that town 🤔 REALLY PEOPLE!! THOSE KIND OF PPL??? Wow, As far as I know they were hard-working man doing some type of construction work in the town. Since when are people so damn rude and since when does the city of Forest Hill belong to whites??  I  wanted to tell the lady something,  but there was alot of people in there and I’m not one to cause a scene. I reached out to the Gas station this evening and asked for the owner, they said it was private Owned company,  so I am hoping the owner doesn’t approve of that type of behavior.</review>

More than once I've stopped here on my way out of the hills with my motorcycle running on fumes. There's no better sight than a gas station when you have no gas and are in the middle of nowhere.</review>

I have known Ali at Regal Bookkeeping for several years. These Working guys are great! Having my books updated each month without much effort on my part is awesome. I feel on top of my business and confident in the financials. For anyone that is looking to take care of their bookkeeping, I'd say there isn't a much better option that Regal Bookkeeping.< /Text>

What would i be able to say, my CPA is GRRREAT!!! Ali and his group worked effectively encouraging me document old and current year government forms. They are well mannered, expert and set aside the effort to everything to you to guarantee you are alright with the whole cycle beginning to end.<//Text>

<review>If you are looking for a trustworthy, responsive, and quick company to get your taxes done, look no further! Ali and his team are incredible. I worked with him, who was so quick, responsive, and was able to take care of both my personal taxes and my business taxes. Last year I reached out to see if they could do my personal taxes and ended up doing turbo tax instead because I didn't want to pay for someone to do my taxes, but I will NEVER make that decision again. It was worth every penny having this team do my taxes this year instead. Highly, highly, highly recommend using this team to do your taxes!&#x1f64f;<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>They are good at what they do, good at accounting; but what they also do is reach into your pocket and take your money. I challenge you to get a quote that matches what they invoice, they also require you to be direct debit. Ali pushes, and has no answers as how long it'll take to do things. I would avoid this group at all costs, unless you're rich. Small businesses beware.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I cannot believe I am giving a positive review for an account! But I am ... and this team deserves it! If you are looking for someone to elegantly handle your taxes look no further they are the BEST in San Diego. I am fully aware that I am a difficult client that always leaves my taxes for the last minute and they always come through! Working with Ali and his team is literally a pleasure. This was not a taxing experience. I highly recommend them: they do my business and personal taxes. They are professional, easy to work with, efficient, and priced beyond reasonable. Thank you &#x1f64f;<//review>

<review>I was very worried about taxes. So I was looking for a tax CPA professional. But I do know about Real Group CPA. From Ali and his staff at Real Group CPA, I was happy and worry-free about the service. I will take service here from now on.</review><UserId.>116757319466654639908< /UserId.><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Ali is very responsive and efficient. I just moved from Wisconsin to California so I needed to file Federal, Wi, and CA tax returns. Ali took care of everything from start to finish in a timely and transparent fashion, always promptly answering any questions (he often responds to emails within minutes). All I had to do was forward him copies of my W-2 and other tax forms, and he prepared all my tax returns quickly and correctly and was ready to file in a matter of days. The process was extremely easy and straightforward and I didn't have to worry about anything. He charges a very fair price, with no hidden fees or catches, and is an excellent communicator who is always available to answer any questions during the whole process. I highly recommend him.< /text>

<Review>These guys are smart, fast and professional.  Will tell you what gets you more of a return and what will effect your return.  And best of all, they charge a very very reasonable price, much less than anyone else I've been to.

Wow, I could not believe how well this worked out. I had literally a BOX of receipts for my startup and we needed to file our C corp taxes. Mr. Ali had his staff organize everything, created neat reports and statements for year-end, and filed our taxes. Even helped with international documents. I could not believe how this group turned an impossible situation into something completely manageable. My spouse and I were literally dreading having to do this and these guys completely handled it on their own entirely hands-off. They may have asked 3 questions, and it was over email. I thought I was going to have to spend weeks doing this. Thank you, Ali!!!!!<//text>

<review>I’ve been with Regal Group CPA over 10 years. In that time I tried other tax preparers as part of due diligence. I even got my California tax prepares licence at one point. These experiences confirmed Ali’s knowledge and expertise. He is an excellent CPA and I highly recommend him.</review><time>1602492361251< /time></record>

Regal Group CPA were a pleasure to work with. Everyone I worked with from establishing a multi state tax strategy, filing taxes, or just general CPA accounting questions on what to do were extremely knowledgeable and patient when it came to my several follows up. What was most impressive was Ali’s response time! Regardless of time of day or year, Ali Emami personally immediately followed up via email, text, and/or phone himself. Most times within minutes already having the answer to my question, but at the least acknowledging my inquiry and providing a timeline of responding. I look forward to working with Regal Group CPA for all my accounting needs.<//review>

I walked in here expecting the usual sterile atmosphere of a CPA's office but was pleasantly surprised by how warm and accommodating Ali Emami was. He was very thorough with our appointment and on my way out I felt quite confident he would do everything in his power to get me the best return. The visit felt like I was catching up with an old friend. I totally recommend him to anyone and everyone.</review>

<text>I just wanted to thank Ali at REGAL GROUP CPA for guiding me through the LLC TAX process. Not only did Ali help choose the right structure, but he helped determine when it would be appropriate to make the switch over to the S-Corporation election. I was impressed with the professionalism and patience when guiding me through deductions and estimated tax payments. I feel so much more at ease knowing that I have a very knowledgeable, responsive, and easy-to-work with CPA accountant assisting me along the way. Thank you Ali!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<review>I found Regal Group CPA through Google . I recently bought a property and didn’t feel confident in the previous tax preparer I used, who worked for a tax franchise to prepare my 2015 taxes. Ali reviewed my 2014 tax return and found a few errors. We ended up amending the previous year return and I got a good size refund. He also did a great job on the 2015 taxes. I'd highly recommend using his service as he and his staff are very knowledgeable, easy going and convenient to work with.</review><gmapID>0x80dc072dc81a9531:0xf2c980dc8dd14137< /gmapID><Time>1469765480714<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Previous to working with Regal Group CPA, it seemed like all my accountants were difficult to get a hold of especially during tax season but Ali always seems to get back to me within a day. Even in his busiest times.  Ali prepares both my business and personal tax returns and he’s a very sharp guy.
His background and experience as a CPA is important to me because of the complexity of my business financial statements and the lending institutions I work with. The bankers and underwriters always seem to be pleased by my tax returns as well and have commented on how well prepared and complete they are. You will not be disappointed!!!<//Review>

New to San Diego and found Regal Group to file my tax returns this year. I had a great experience with them as the whole filing process went so smoothly and fast. They asked me lots of questions and reviewed all the details to ensure that I can receive all the deductions that I am entitled to. Everything could be submitted electronically and so is very convenient for any client. My wife and I will surely be using Regal Group again next year.<//Text>

Ali is a tremendous asset for our company. During our initial consultation with him we were advised that the entity type we were doing business under wasn't taking advantage of several tax saving strategies. We followed their lead and advice and have saved tremendously since then. Also with their firm we're able to have our payroll, accounting and taxes completed by one company. Saving us time and energy. The whole staff seems to be very efficient and knowledgeable in everything that they do.</Review>

Previously, I used to always prepare my own tax returns but after getting an inheritance from my uncle I decided to start using a CPA for my tax preparation this year. I’m very satisfied with the job Ali did for me. He’s a very nice, patient and knowledgeable CPA. I thought I would have to pay a lot of tax on the k-1 trust income I received, but it turned out to be a lot less than I thought with his help.<//Review>

<Review>This was my first time working with Ali  and I have to say that from the very beginning he was very kind, professional and prompt.  I came to him at the very last minute before taxes were due and he made a usually stressful time, very easy and carefree.  Regal Group CPA prices are very fair as well. I highly recommend Regal Group CPA and plan to have him as my CPA from here on out. Awesome job!!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

They do an excellent job and are very responsive to our needs, whether it’s providing financial statements, pay stubs or support during workers comp audits. We were trying to do our accounting and payroll with an in house accountant but after we consulted with Mr. Emami and his staff, we realized she was making mistakes and costing us more than just outsourcing the work to them in the first place. We’re now in the process of having them take over the accounting services on our two remaining businesses. I would highly recommend their whole team.<//Review><Time>1472694382389< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80dc072dc81a9531:0xf2c980dc8dd14137<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ali is a genius when it comes to taxes and helped me to actually understand my tax return situation after I left my last tax preparer in 2013. He also did some planning for me in 2015 and I ended up using a retirement account and other deductions to save on my taxes. I would highly recommend Ali for anyone looking for an excellent CPA in the San Diego area.< /text>

I went to Regal Group CPA after having a bad experience with an online bookkeeping company I was using for my business. When I took their financials to my bank for an expansion loan I was turned down. The underwriters of the bank explained that the books were messy and didn't make sense.

From my first consultation with Ali Emami, my experience was excellent. Ali and his staff helped me to clean up my books and since then I got the loan and they've been a valued partner in my business. I've also had them prepare my personal and business returns and handle my payroll. Their whole team is professional and very knowledgable.< /review>

I don't usually leave bad reviews but this lady was acting like she wanted to go home already or she just didn't want to do anything for the last hour of her shift. First it was obvious when she didn't help right away and took her time to walk over. Then she was acting like she couldn't hear anything we were saying and we were talking pretty loud and clear. And then she started giving us an attitude. After that she started playing the victim when I started giving her an attitude. By the way, she shouldn't be talking smack in Spanish about me in my face just because I look like I don't know Spanish because I do understand Spanish.< /Text>

I love the fact that no one hardly comes here. To me it's a diamond in the ruff since it's in panorama city. I got served fast the place look clean and the staff was Braden answered any questions I had. I absolutely love this subway< /Text>

<Text>I went to this Subway today on my lunch break, and after standing inline for 10mins they would not allow me to order my regular. I have been going to Subway once a wk for many yrs at different locations around so Cal, since I am a nurse. I have always ordered just tuna in a bowl 6in portion. I have never had an issue. This store manager told me she could not sell me this cuz it could make me sick smh. Wow. I wont be going back. I asked for the owers #, and she told me he would have to call me.  I think they forgot this is a franchise and rules are in place that make it mandatory for all franchises to follow the same standards. The staff also messed up the 2 orders before me.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I live in the area and always USED to come to this specific spot but customer service is key to me . So seeing as there are a good amount of Subways every couple miles or so I will definitely not be back to this one to give them my business anymore .< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Service is good by some employees, but there’s always this short chubby girl that has a really bad attitude and you can tell she hates her job so much. Like if she doesnt want to make sandwiches, then might as well quit your job cause subway ain’t doing it for her<//review>< rating>

<review>I was super excited when we got a domino's here. But it has been pretty disappointing. Their salads are prepackaged salads and not very good. My chicken was not prepared well.</review>< pics>

<Text>I am giving 1 star for the pizza, the amount of topping is surprisingly so little, in a large pizza there were barely 8 small pcs of chicken topping. I like the staffs there though, they are friendly. Business owner, you have to do better with the quality of food you provide to your customers. 👍</Text><Rating>1< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Domino's is always a great place to eat and on a budget. A large 3 topping pizza for 7.99 that's unheard of. You might be thinking, that's cheap for a pizza must taste like cardboard?!? Couldn't be further from the truth. Me and my family go and get 3 large pizzas with everyone's toppings and get out the door for under 25 bucks!! You would be hard pressed to get 1 from Roundtable for that price. If you are looking for a good, easy, cheap lunch or supper idea then look no further.< /Review>< pictures>

Went on 10/2, first day opened. Service was a little slow, only because there were four people working and they had a lot of orders to make. Food was delicious!

Update: horrible customer service, especially over the phone. Was left on hold for 15+ minutes once, also was delivered the wrong pizza, and ended up never getting the right one because the delivery driver decided to go home. The food is always great, but the customer service... not so much<//Review>

The food is good but almost everytime I go here they mess up on my order. The order is pretty clear and easy to get but the workers keep messing up and is a waste of money to not have my order correct. I waited to write a review to try again and it just keeps happening. Today they messed up on 2 of my orders and they weren't even busy at all. Not going here anymore. They def need to step up their game.< /review>

< Review>
We ordered from here the first time, carryout only coupon 1 large 3 topping pizza, order of bread twists with marinara and a 2 liter soda for $15. They messed up the pizza ( forgetting the bacon on our bacon feta diced tomatoes pizza) they also made it hand tossed instead of thin like ordered. They forgot the marinara sauce to go with the garlic twist knots and also didn't have the Coca-Cola 2 liter we ordered. We let them know about all the mistakes. They said we would be credited for next time. We then went back a couple days later ordered the same thing hoping it would be right this time. I had to keep telling them about the carryout deal  they told me repeatedly I was wrong and it didn't exist. I was then given to the manager who argued with me. I said can you look up my last order from two days ago. She then finally ( to me begrudgingly) gave me the coupon. We picked up our order and they still messed up the pizza again with hand tossed instead of the thin crust and still no bacon just feta and diced tomatoes. And I still paid full coupon price even though they acknowledged my credit from the mess up before.< /Review>

<Text>I have ordered 2 times from here. The first time was delivered and my pizza came 20 minutes later then I was told. However it was just how I ordered it.

I went again tonight, ordered online and picked it up in store. I was told the pizza was coming out of the oven. I sat at the store for 30 minutes, while waiting I got to see employees making pizza's without gloves and touching hair and face. After waiting 30 minutes, they were very busy so i was being kind and patient, we asked about our pizza and was told they are remaking it because it was given to the wrong person. After another 10 minutes my pizza came to us. Got home my pizza was wrong it had toppings I did not order, thankfully we have no allergies and not fully cooked. Also, my cinnamon twists were cold from waiting so long. The online tracker is incorrect and not accurate, seems to be as though they know.... still it should be accurate< /Text><userid>109979242221154921735<//userid>< username>

<text>Customer service is good but when I place an order they ALWAYS get it wrong. Even when I place an order with the app with detailed order it still comes out wrong. Sometimes I wonder if the workers dont care enough to double check if the order is correct but instead make whatever they feel like. I love Domino's pizza but this one in Ukiah has swayed my judgment and will no longer be getting dominos again</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>In the past they have messed up 4/5 orders I’ve made at this location. Not even joking this is exactly how my 6th order arrived. They’re website wasn’t working properly and I had several back and forth calls with them about items missing on their website when they were available to purchase. I couldn’t use my “free pizza” reward over the phone so I had no choice but to order online. I was told “oh well”. After giving up with what I originally wanted I just ordered two pizzas. This is what I got for my free pizza.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhDHL2gXLWvDy2wpggccuo35XykSMqBu4bXxej=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808165945afe0d69:0xfb42c2ade7255bee<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Gave them a few tries to get it together and this is still my rating. Haven't received 1 completely correct and hot order from this location. They have improved but still have a ways to go.</text>

Absolutely DO NOT recommend the Mediterranean sandwich . I ordered it today and it was very sloppy made and had burnt hard cheese on it. Last week I tried the chicken bacon ranch sandwich and it was great.... guess I’ll have to stick with that.< /text>

<Review>Ordered two pizzas online for delivery at 5:10pm.  Monitored their "Tracking Service" on their website and at 5:45pm it stated delivered.  I opened the door to find no pizzas waiting for me.  Called Dominos and they stated that my order was with the delivery driver and that they were running a little behind.  Waited till 6:45pm and called Dominos again wanting an update on what was going on with the delivery driver and my order.  Was told that my order was still with the driver and that he was very close to dropping it off. (I started to wonder just how cold that pizza must be after an hour of being in the delivery driver's car).

At 7:45pm, I called again and when they answered they said "Thanks for calling, but we are closed.".  I said "Ok, well then I got a problem as I still don't have my order delivered.".  After some back and forth of giving my information (for the third time), I was told that my order had been delivered to the wrong address.  They said they would remake my order and it would be ready in 15 minutes.

Well, it took longer than that (which I expected) but it finally arrived.  The thing that really gets me though is that there was no real apology, no offer for credit on my next order, nothing but "Hey, Happy New Year!".  Sorry, but that is not good enough.  If they had been upfront about being behind or misplacing my order and actually sound genuine in being sorry for the mix up, I would completely understand.  Mistakes happen.  To just blow it off though, that's pretty messed up Dominos.</Review><user_id>106306935297511329287< /user_id>< Rating>

The food was so bad. I’ll be avoiding this place from now on, or at least until they are open for awhile and then maybe the food will get better. 🤷🏻‍♀️<//Text>

I want to leave 3.5 stars because the first night I went there the pizza was delicious, I loved the flavor or the pan crust. My gf and I were both very happy with our pizzas so we decided to go back a few days later. I ordered the pan pizza again with the garlic sauce, light cheese(the pan pizza comes with 2 layers of cheese) and regular topping. When I recieved my pizza it had regular tomatoe sauce not the garlic sauce I wanted so I went back and showed them. I didn't want to wait 40 minutes for a remake so they gave me a credit for the next time. So we get all the way home in hopland and I bite into a slice and immediately spit it out. It was RAW like almost completely. I called and a teenager answered after I explained my frustration she told me that the manager was out delivering pizza and she didn't know what to do.

So disappointing<//Text>

<Text>Gateway is the right way. The vacuums are powerful and the lava wash is the best bang for your buck in the Ceres area. Not to mention they actually apply the tire shine by hand and also wipe down the excess water after coming out the car wash. Couldn’t be more pleased with the customer service.<//Text>< UserId.>

I love how clean my van smells,  looks and feels after getting the full service. Today, I got the oil change and a full service on my van and just loved the difference overall. They didn't lift up my back seats and vacuum under there but that's OK, I can do that, since I forgot to even ask. It was nice being able to sit down and focus on my work while getting my van taken care of and the staff are very friendly!<//text>

Paid for the complete wash with tire dressing. Really worth the $$
We've taken our vehicle back several times.

<text>After waiting for 20 minutes for someone to clean the inside of my car, I told the employee that I wanted my money back. He said he didn't blame me, that he would too. He called Ron, the manager, to take care of it. I told Ron that I would appreciate it if he would hurry. He said, "I will take my time if you are going to be rude!" Then instead of bringing me my money, he tucked it under the wiper blade of my car, which was across the parking lot and disappeared until I walked outside. As I told him, I have been going here for over a year to get my car washed about once a week. I will never go back.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
DO NOT WASH YOUR CAR HERE ,, I went there to wash my car spinning brushes that clean the sides of cars broke my drivers door mirror ,, talked to owner and told him what happened didn't seem to care even,, owner asked how do i know if his wash broke my mirror i told him because when i started the car wash mirror was fine when i exited the wash mirror was broke, i offered to buy if at a local wreaking yard for $100. and install it my self saving him from paying the dealership $280. plus labor cost his response he would call Chrysler and call me the next day never called me i stopped in and called and let my number 3 times never called me back ,, TAKE YOUR CAR TO THE OTHER CAR WASH BUSINESSES THE STAND BEHIND THERE SERVICES AND ANY DAMAGE IT MAY CAUSES READ OTHER REVIEWS<//Review>

I found your basic 29.95 very misleading. When it was all said and done, the bill came to $47 and some change. Next time I'll stick with Jiffy Lube, never had to pay $47 for the same oil change.<//Text>

Got my car wash here and my side door mirror broke. An incident report was made and pictures were taken. I was told the owner would call me and I'm still waiting. I called and was told no manager was in. I'll keep pushing this situation until something is done.<//review>

< Review>
The guys there were extremely helpful. Gave me all the recommended parts to build a board for my son's Birthday present to which I was totally grateful. Extra kudos to the manager for knock-knock jokes, occupational hazards, future career moves, and being an all-around good dude!</Review>

Turtle is the name of a nice and hardworking man. He is a cashier at Walmart and he is usually there when we come to shop! what I really appreciate is the way he packs stuff in bags, the way he communicates, and how professional he is! I wish more of Walmart people would be like him! To some these gestures mean nothing but to me these gestures mean the world. When I come home I put things away in a beat! I hope his supervisors see this comment and help him go up on the scale!<//Text>

<Text>When you need something right away and the closet store is Walmart, it became a life saver for me. I was eating some Carne asada tacos at work and I got a piece of meat stuck between my teeth. It was irritating and I didn't have any floss around so luckily I have a Walmart across the street from my work office. The parking lot is huge so you won't have any issues finding parking. When I walked in, there a greeter by the door and I was able to find what I was looking for right away. I went to the self checkout because I only had 2 items. Their machine was kind of slow but I was able to pay for my item and leave. There also a person watching the exit, I guess to be a lookout for theft. I was in and out within like 5 minutes. I wore my mask and everyone I saw had their mask on as well.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaldVoRUUv_bjgCdLWeYnPyIlnXeK0rmaYLntw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTmXKuOhlG6dXxgnSob2Ak9ZjR6KwDf6oMGnx7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOql20mKPUe_BvWjl5Cr2DDYcnBWLDhUiw4ASn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMndmuWNVMxgs_71k0Mhm76k9nWI2EAP37kKjZd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU9F60SwJX8tIvgAOp7_oyeMcGFG8xQ5L9CjxI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

This place used to be so nice. But lately it's a mess. I feel like I'm in south LA not Simi Valley. The halls are so narrow and full of stuff. And the women's section feels so claustrophobic. I would give  it 0 stars if I could.<//text>

Aside from the interesting people you see, and added security, this store is neat and contains a variety of items from groceries ( including perishables ), clothing, electronics and craft supplies. The service is great upon entering and leaving the store, but trying to get someone with a somewhat happy attitude to help you is hard to do. They lock up the makeup products to prevent theft, but no one is around to unlock the cabinet. I asked three times, and finally had to call the store to get help! All in all, it's a good store as long as you don't need much customer service from their employees.<//text>

<text>I regularly only get a few items from Walmart because of the great pricing, even better than big online mega sellers, it really saves me some bucks as I purchase a couple of items at least twice a month. So, lately I have checked a couple of prices on other items I was going to purchase and I was glad I did, that is of course if they have what your looking for.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e82e95deec5b69:0xb4df5fcfa3f0620< /Gmap_id></record>

I have very bad anxiety. It's to the point I refuse to leave my house unless it's extremely important.  I say this because I want you to know why I value this place so highly.

Their order pickup staff are the friendliest people I've ever met. They go out of their way to help make sure everything is ok with your order.  They'll even help take it to your car if necessary.

The pharmacy staff are also friendly. As well as the Service Desk.  To be perfectly honest I haven't run into anyone that wasn't nice.

But not everything is unicorns and rainbows.  It can be difficult to find someone to help you sometimes. It seems like everyone on the floor goes on break at the same time.  Also, the manager never seems to plan for someone to cover for those on lunch or on break.

Other than that it's really a great place to run in and out for whatever you need.<//Review>

Wow some of the employees here are just so rude. They wouldn’t even acknowledge me when I was in line for a return. Once I said I was there for a return, still no response and didn’t bother to greet. When they finally decided to help me, I felt they were bothered with my presence and had an attitude. She was even sighing. Management really needs to work on teaching their employees to greet customers respectfully, as well as making them comfortable. Main reason why I never go here...</Text>

<Date>1611192617789</Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I like Walmart, and frequently shop there. But today they get one Star.
I was checking out Purchasing my items to find out they were out of plastic bags, but could buy there's for $1 each.
I had a full basket of small items, so I was pretty much stuck buying them.
Just so you know, it isn't really about the money, as is the principle. I spend tons of money with this company, their families are worth billions and they can't even give away bags that probably cost them a penny.
Pretty pathetic!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>I DO NOT recommend Walmart for photo printing. I had three camera film rolls that I put in the box thing for them to be developed and do you know what I get when I come back a week later?! They lost one of them, and it’s been over a month now and it is still lost! They lost my memories and I probably won’t ever get them back! Don’t do Walmart, they’ll lose your precious memories and you won’t ever ever get them back.</review>< Pics>

The last time I went to this store, there was an employee stocking a pallet in almost every isle I went down. And I kid you not 1 ONE check stand open for anyone with more than 15 items. ZERO self checkouts over 15 items. There is an employee to check how many people enter, a separate employee to count how many people exit the store, and at least ONE employee to check the fewer than less than 15 items selfcheckout/ give out bags so you can self bag your own groceries. There was ONE other checkstand open, but only open for fewer than 15 items. I literally saw the girl text on her phone while the ONLY CHECKSTAND open for more than 15 items was pilled back into the women's clothes it was so long.< /Review>

This is a pretty good Walmart location. Everything was well organized within the store and very easy to find. It seems that they also had a great selection of groceries as well. I do not think that they had a vegetable section that was as complete as other Walmarts.< /Review>

This Walmart is kind of depressing. Very small selection of a variety of things. Found a couple great deals, but won't be a regular here.</Text>

< Review>
This Walmart is awesome! Stocked up, clean and very organized. It is spacious and many open registers and self checkouts. I went in the morning between 9-11am and the employees that I've met were amicable. A lot of seniors were there (were friendly too) and the vibe was calm there and not sketchy. Only con is that it hardly has fresh foods(whole foods),mostly freezer, canned goods,processed and variety of alcohol.<//Review>

I heard them call "customer needs help in the paint isle and the cosmetic department" over 6 times. I was in the paint department so I know it took over a half-hour for someone to come. The kicker was the store wasn't even busy.... A few isles over there were 3 employees being chatty Cathys as one of them stocked the water.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>4< /Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Text>This is probably the nicest of the Walmarts in Ventura county. The store is clean and has a decent variety of selection.  The only negative thing about it that comes to mind is the same thing that I find plagues most Walmart stores and that is too few checkout lines with actual cashiers.  On our last trip there was only one. Granted there are a number of self checkouts, but there are certain items that cannot be paid for it self checkout (e.g. alcoholic beverages). Granted things with Covid have probably not helped, but this was an issue with Walmart in general even pre-Covid.</Text><user_name>Draxus<//user_name><gmap_id>0x80e82e95deec5b69:0xb4df5fcfa3f0620<//gmap_id><response>None</response>< Date>

The company themselves has not yet offered their employees hazard pay for working in such a high-risk position, so I would avoid supporting this buisiness all together.<//Text>< Pics>

This Walmart is well stocked. Due to the holidays it was very busy but I was able to find what I was looking for. The funny thing is I looked for and asked for these items at the CVS in Target and was referred to Walmart by them.</text>

"Walmart. When you can't find Target." This place is SKETCHY! The parking lot is so dimly lit at night it looks abandoned. I almost expect to be mugged when walking to my car. The few times I've shopped here at night I just accept that I might be mugged walking to my car. Buy a flat screen at 10pm and park at the far end of the lot. You won't be watching TV that night lol.< /text>

Even though the store is well stocked and some of the employees are great they do have  problems. There is one employee that will stop her day to watch you at the self check out, to the point of being offensive. Unfortunately i have dealt with her on more than 5 occasions and  I am done. They also have floor "managers" that are trained to lie. No matter the complaint "I'll speak with them." is a lie. Nothing changes. I will not be going back ever again.< /review>

Today was my worst experience at Walmart ever! They are supposed to be so great for pricing and price matching, but they are not. I was buying some tie downs and in the isle found 4 for the price of $9.44. Such a deal! I was so excited!! They had all of the 4 packs for this price. We grabbed 3, only to get to the register and be told they are actually $15.44 each. I had them go and price check, because why would all of the same 4 packs be under the $9.44 price if they were not that price. I understand then being in the wrong spot, or if only one or a few were. They were not, they messed the price tags up and then would only give me the $9.44 for 1 of the 3 I was purchasing. I asked to speak with a manager as though although I understand it was a mistake, that was how they labeled them. Come on, this is unacceptable. Fix the problem and give me the price YOUR company had posted. The lead comes up and as I nicely try to explain this to her she gets snippy, has a huge attitude, is extremely rude and seemed to not want to see my side of it. She instead shut me down, not in a nice way and made me upset because that’s not how you speak to a customer. Especially one trying to resolve an issue that is not mine. It left a bad taste in my mouth and made me have a negative view of Walmart in general.

Sincerely,
A very frustrated and upset customer</Text>

The cashiers actually deserve a raise! Seriously!!! I’ve never seen such an efficient check out at any retail store!! Being a cashier isn’t easy and these cashiers are GOOD at their job! The cashiers are why I’m giving a 4 star review instead of 3!!!!< /review>< Pictures>

The Walmart on Cochran in Simi Valley has double the amount of stuff than any other Walmart I have been to.  Their automotive and housewares section is amazing. Lots of new gadgets. I love gadgets</Text>

And yes, as of September 2018 they still do sell ammunition. Good clothing selection as well. If in Simi Valley this is the better Walmart to go to. There is another one close by but this one is far superior.< /Review><date>1536458955697<//date><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

This store has a lot of food but isn't a complete market. Their nursery has just about everything you need, but again for less.</text>< Pics>

You know, when it rains and your in the store it’s really loud. Look up the next time you are there. Absolutely zero dollars have been spent to make it a “finished” ceiling.

I asked the cashier for a bag she told me she was out of bag another cashier came over and brought her bags and she still didn't offer me a bag after I had already asked her for one. So I  I was like oh you have bad you're not going to even offer me a bag now there she goes on here ma'am I'm sorry I shouldn't have to task you for a bag again. The employees that work there are so rude and snotty it's only a few that I see on a daily basis that are nice most of them have attitudes and on drugs seen one girl in there  nodding off before.<//text>

Went for in store pickup. The employee in charge of pick ups was waiting and ready to help get the order. She also went and got a cart for ease of transport to the car. Quick, efficient, and good service< /review>

<text>This Walmart has the worst Automotive Centers. No one knows anything or does anything. It's always empty and they assign an employee to stand at the door for security that knows nothing. Poor service all around and if ya want your car serviced you have to setup an appointment. 2 thumbs down for this Walmart.<//text>< Resp>

<Text>TIP: if you’re returning food, even closed plastic bottle item, you will need a hard copy receipt and or the credit card used to be present.

<review>Love the prices - store is pretty clean but expect ridiculously long wait if you don't check yourself out.  Some people really need a job (as cashier) so we usually stand in line with only 1 or 2 cashiers working.  Sad.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

< Review>
It has become a very unpleasant experience to shop.  They keep providing with lesser quality, and higher prices. Even packaging is bad,and user unfriendly, very hard to unwrap. They are not, the customer oriented store. They need new management to say the least or policy. The
regular employees try to treat
you as a customer.<//Review>

Got there early today to avoid the crowds. I believe they open at 6am. I went to the larger Walmart in Simi. They of course have more choices like groceries ,plants , small appliances like coffee makers ,toasters etc. Very nice store<//Text>

This Walmart I clean and neat. It's got plenty of parking and is full of helpful.staff. the checkout lines are quick. There are Dept personnel in every Dept. Every employee I met seemed delighted to be there working and happy to help. None of this happens at the Walmart I go to in Seattle. I'm amazed this Walmart is a Walmart.< /Text>

<Date>1531185298392</Date><rating>2<//rating><review>I will give this place a fair and Honest review this was my very first time going to Walmart for an oil change and tire rotation.
Things that went wrong OK let me name many OK first thing it took them 15 minutes to acknowledge that I was the third one in line and informed me that I needed to go inside and register my car then I did that second I was informed that it will be 45 minutes in my car would be done I stayed there for 2 1/2 hours before my car in and out oriole change and car a tire rotation was done
John and Adam were moving like snails even though cars were just lining up and people are just waiting very patiently.
Finally the worst part is that when left with my car on the freeway I noticed that they never calibrated my dashboard for oil change so I'm driving and it's still saying service oil change soon so they never fixed my notification on my dashboard so I'm still walking with that needs to be taken care of positive the only positive thing was Joe the supervisor who is inside he was nice polite and apologized many times that's my Feedback to everyone!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Each Walmart has different prices on food. Neighborhood markets are higher than the regular Walmart stores</Review>

<text>I only come here for a few things I can't get anywhere else. They obviously have the best prices, too. I desire greater quality than much of their offerings but I can't knock what's been there for me.<//text>< gmapID>

I called to ask a simple question was put on hold for 10 minutes only for them to say that, That department is not answering so she cannot answer my question. I don't feel like that is an acceptable answer.  Does not all associates have access to walking around the store? I just need to know if a specific item is carried before I make my trip out there.<//Text>

Certain employees there don't know how to act at their place of business. Luckily the customer service manager was super sweet and kind to take care of the problem. Not her fault for them being completely immature kids even though they are in their 40's . Thank God that the manager took care of the problem she is the reason why I gave 5 stars she was a sweetheart 😉< /review>

Typical Walmart. A lot of things here are less expensive than comparable stores. Every shopping experience at Walmart feels cheap. Yes. The process are low. The quality varies. Some items are really good but many tend to be so so.</review>

< Review>
The store is cleaner then most I've been to and employees are friendly and helpful would be 5 stars but the parking lot at night is so dark and dangerous. On my way back to car I couldn't see where it was and a dip in the parking lot almost made me roll my ankle. Had I not had the cart I probably would have rolled my ankle and fell. The only lights are where the cart drop off is. Go and leave before sun sets and you should be ok. They get 5 stars for darkest parking lot in Simi<//Review>

It's always way too crowded and uncomfortable trying to navigate through the store. The other shoppers are very aggressive and will NOT move out of your way. Also, the employees are obsessed with checking your receipt before you leave the store, even if you only buy one thing and they watch you pay for it. It's a very uncomfortable experience and I don't want to go back.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

These people doesn't know where anything is and if they did they are definitely are not going to get it for you. Also they wouldn't give me the name of the manager who was not even at the store. Only the assistant manager was and they wouldn't call her so she could talk to me.</review>

Needed a new straight talk phone on Tuesday Nite...mine was dead and info lost. Electronic Employee seemed annoyed by me asking to see different phones behind counter. Was not any help on trying to tell me how to retrieve any info off of old phone. I ended up getting a LG Solo for $138. I was flustered and did not think about getting case or screen protector and was not offered. Friday am, I drove the 8 miles to Wal-Mart again before work. Employee picked out the only black case that was offered and screen protector and put together while I shopped for another item. Picked up phone on way out. Wasn't until I was home again and realized screen protector was NOT the right size. It covered up info on top of my screen. Went back in evening and there was not any that fit my new phone. This Employee tried to look on Wal-Mart's online site and could not find any. Had to go wait in customer service line to return items. This am I ordered, what I hope works on Amazon. Will not receive for at least 5 days! Not very happy with my 3 visits to Wamart.< /Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>It's Walmart. They have a lot of stuff. Typically it's all imported, but there are some USA made products. Friendly people and a broad selection of products. They also sell tires and oil changes at good prices. I use their synthetic oil changes, which just was reduced by $5.00. Right when I need it to! 😁<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We went to get a TV or a computer monitor here. We were approached by Marcello who works in the TV area and he was fantastic. Please make sure he sees this since he was informative and helpful. We finally decided on a Vizio 32 TV and my son was very happy. I helped him move into USC. My son will go back to this store for other items in the future i as well.<//Review>< pics>

I rarely shop there because it has a "economy buy" feel to it.  So I should expect that the people who work there are accustomed to people of limited means.  But whether a person is fortunate or not, the people who work there should treat people fairly.  I was in the self help checkout because I buy things for my dog there and I want to get in and out quickly.  I wanted the dog's shampoo in a separate bag from anything else.  But because I was trying to put it in a different bag, the woman who worked there thought I was trying to steal the $0.98 bottle of dog shampoo.  Really?  Does anyone do that?   This reminds me of why I don't like to shop at Walmart.  It's a different class of people there.  It's why people pronounce Target- "tar-jay".  You just feel as though things are better quality at Target, even when the items are the same.  Maybe it's the fact that the sales people are less disgruntled.  One star for you today.  You get a dunce cap.<//text>

<Review>If you have to go to Wal-Mart the one in Simi Valley is the best one in the area. I go out if the way to go to this one and I live in Santa Paula where Ventura and Oxnard is actually closer to me. This one has much better parking and not as busy as the othert two yet is a full sized store like Oxnard.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Review>This walmart has a very slow online pick up section. It once took them over 30 minutes to (not)find a flash drive i ordered and got an email notification saying they have it ready for pick up.  I do like that they have a good selection of electronics.< /Review>< pictures>

I found everything I was looking for, and the cashier was great. But I didn't care for the small ass kid at the exit. By the way, when did Walmart get rid of greeters and hire people to police customers on their way out of the store? I don't think I'll be back to that store.<//Text>

Great place to go buy what u need from food to auto parts. The employees are really nice to you when you come in to when you leave. I really enjoyed going to Wal-Mart overall.<//text>

I came to this location to buy a double cheeseburger and some french fries at the McDonald's inside. Was not disappointed in the least bit. The french fries were soggy and greasy; just the way I like it. The Mcdouble tasted just like it smells, delicious. The Walmart was pretty cool too.</Review>

Meh, it's a Walmart, and not a very good one. It's often understocked, very confusingly laid out, and I've never seen a cashier working the regular lines, they only have the self-checkouts open which is a real pain in the a**. But then again, the low prices are the only reason to go to a Walmart anyways, you're not going for a great shopping experience or anything like that.<//Text>

<review>A well stock clean wallmart.
Video surveillance on every isle. Is there alot of criminal activity??? And if there is the outside (parking lot) it's very dark.
It makes you feel unsafe as you comeout of a store that is very concerned with theft.

Wallmart keep your costumers safe as you do your product.
Because we walk out your store with the same products you have under surveillance.

Thank you.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I wanted to get my photos printed, but the photo department was gone. I was told they are closing the store near Sycamore May 18th. I had to drive several miles out of my way to go to the one near Home Depot. The photo print computers here Do not have the ability to add frames around the printed photo.you can add one white frame, but the computers at the store they are closing had the choice of about 6 frames. I couldn't wait for the photos to be printed,so I had to make another round trip just to pick them up. It was a waste of my time. I will go somewhere else next time.<//text>

This is my experience with the pharmacy. For some reason they did not accept the goodrx price. The lady that helped me is the usual person there. She had to ask for my birthday several times and was sick. She must have felt terrible because her nose was congested and she sounded very sick. I think if you're sick you should stay home so you don't infect others. I had to disinfect everything she touched including my phone.</text>

Auto service at this location is a mess. They've got no idea how long a job will take and no idea how to do it right.  Went in to get a battery changed....and added an oil change to service order.

1)  I knew that I needed a battery.  (AAA had tested it when they came out to start the car), nonetheless, the girl on the counter insisted she would not sell me one until her mechanic tested it.  Apparently my service time was extended because the shop didn't know which battery to install....so they just waited for the sales staff..   I had to intervene and tell the sales help to send the battery I wanted out to the service floor.

2) Pushed to up-sell an air filter...told her no that I had changed it only a few months ago.  Seemed unwilling to take no for an answer.

3)  When I received my car back (1.5 hours, not the 45 I was promised), it was hard to start and idled rough regularly missing cylinders. On opening the hood, *both* battery cables were loose, and only finger tight.  Had to hunt down the mechanic to remedy this...all the while insisting that it wasn't *his* fault.  (seriously?  He's the one who changed the battery)

4)  Got about 1 mile away from the store when the check engine and other trouble lights came on.  Was already late for an appointment, so I did not return to Walmart.  The next morning I took the car to a local auto parts store.to borrow an OBD II reader to read the trouble codes. Came up with "engine too lean" & "mass flow air problem."  Eventually sorted this out with another trip under the hood.  Despite telling the auto center staff I did not want or need an air filter, they'd obviously checked it anyway...
....because one of the filter box latches was left undone, and the hose from the crankcase to the air system was hanging disconnected (one needs to disconnect this to get the filter box lid off.)  It certainly was not that way when it arrived at Walmart.

5)  Like another person on this thread had mentioned, apparently Walmart''s mechanics can't be bothered to reset the "service needed" light.  Lazy and/or sloppy.

Do yourself a favor....   The pennies you save by taking it here will be repaid in all sorts of wasted time, and having to get others to do the jobs right.</Text>

Also they rely on self checkout too much.

Went to pick up 12 cases of dog food  (6 of one type and 6 of another ). They only had 4 on the shelf of one type so I asked an associate if they might have two more cases in the back. She left to check and after ten minutes she never returned. I picked up a few other items I needed and headed to the checkout. they are down to 7 check out registers, the rest are self checkout. 6 were closed and the only one open was the 10 items or less, so I waited in that line. The other people in line were just staring at the 4 associates 20 feet away just talking and laughing not paying attention to their customers. not a big deal but just hit me wrong this morning, I know they can do better<//review>

Went into walmart like I normally do to cash my check and when arriving to the counter, not only was I not greeted, but also was basically being ignored while the cashier Tammi was having a conversation with a manager that was working next to her. It wasn't until Tammi needed my current address when she finally acknowledged that she was helping someone, and since my currently NEW address isn't the same as my formal address on my ID, I told her to use my p.o. box address which I use to receive all my mail. Tammi and the manager that was with her first tried to say that my ID was expired since they saw that it expires this year. I told them to check a little bit more thoroughly and they'll see that it doesn't expire untill December of this year, therefore is still valid. It seemed like they didn't like me correcting them, because after that I got nothing but a condescending passive aggressive attitude. They both told me rudely that I can't use a p.o. box address. I told them to hang on a second while I look up my NEW address on my phone because I told them that I didn't remember my NEW address of the top of my head due to the fact that I just moved into a NEW place, and also am just used to using my p.o. box adress,  So while I star to look up my address that I put in my phone, Tammi condescendingly said "NO, you should know your address" and said "normal people know there address off the top of their head and that there's just something fishy about that. I said that's normally true, but not if you just moved into a new place for only a couple of weeks and are used to using a p.o. box address. They then said I now have to show proof that I live there. I replied "why do I need proof now, and not when you asked me to give an address off the top of my head". I said "you can't prove I live at whatever address I give you anyway, so why all of a sudden are you acting like I'm not the person on the ID and why are you trying to belittle me for not knowing my NEW address off the top of my head". They obviously wanted to make sure to make it an inconvenience to get my check cashed. There was no reason for them to all of a sudden ask me for proof of where I live and insinuate I'm all of a sudden trying to pull a con and act like I'm not not who I am in my ID because my new address change and I didn't update my ID yet. I guess that it's too far fetched not remember your new address lol
All I can say is WOW!!!< /text>

The other people in line were just staring at the 4 associates 20 feet away just talking and laughing not paying attention to their customers. not a big deal but just hit me wrong this morning, I know they can do better< /Text>

Walmart is the place to go when ever you need anything, there's always friendly staff to help you find what you are looking for, prices are really good and lower than most places and if you use the savings catcher you could get money back.<//Review>

The Walmart family plan is a scam if you have a sim card issue.  They won't even give you a refund if they send you a defective card & or put the time back on your phone that was lost. Zero stars!!!!!!!< /text>

The line in the garden section was extremely long and wait time was unacceptable. The checker called for help 3x before another checker came. The one star is for the store not the checker as she did the best she could under the circumstances.</review>

<text>Walmart continues to be my least favorite place. Seems like they are always out of what I want and their employees seem to know nothing about their job or what they carry. I can't count the times I have asked when something was going to be in stock only to hear " We don't carry that" Really I have been buying here every week for 10 years..< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>As Wallmart goes this is one of the better ones. The parking lot is mostly clean. The store inside is better organized than others. Shelves and products look nicer . I have not had to interact with staff at this one but they seemed to be on top of things here. There wasn't a single person at the front of the store asking to sign this or that or selling some obscure promotion. And there wasn't any loitering at all by the front doors. There's was however a family of beggars on the corner where you have to drive out, this ruined my otherwise not so bad Wallmart experience. Huh in Simi Valley no less Well I would hope Simi PD will take care of that.</text>< pics>

I came to replace one tire and rotate all tires.  They rotated the tires and replaced the wrong tire.  2 days later I still have one tire leaking air.<//review>

<Review>As Wallmart goes this is one of the better ones. The parking lot is mostly clean. The store inside is better organized than others. Shelves and products look nicer . I have not had to interact with staff at this one but they seemed to be on top of things here. There wasn't a single person at the front of the store asking to sign this or that or selling some obscure promotion. And there wasn't any loitering at all by the front doors. There's was however a family of beggars on the corner where you have to drive out, this ruined my otherwise not so bad Wallmart experience. Huh in Simi Valley no less Well I would hope Simi PD will take care of that.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Everytime I come here I deal with rude employees..... Last time, I wanted to return some DVDs that I had lost the receipt for. The last was so rude and had the dam nerve to say " are you sure these aren't stolen?" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? how dare her assume and say something like that about a customer! I will never try to return anything there again. She was so dam rude. She was an older white lady. I think her name was Sam but I can't remember.... REALLY? That is no way to treat a customer and say something like that . She was very pushy and was trying quickly to get me out of the line when I had some questions I felt needed to be answered</Review>

Maybe the customers are on a budget and that forces them to shop at a store that's nothing more than an enlarged Woolworths. Selling extraordinarily lousy products. But whats even more heart rendering is that employees are paid at lowest minimum wage. While the executives are keeping the majority of the profits . The logo for Walmart is the happy face. Its the only  representative thing in the store that smiles. Customers keep shopping here and one day your wages will be lowered. Make a stand and shop where people are treated with dignity and a wage to support their families.<//review>< date>

<Text>Been to this Wal-Mart many times. 1 visit made me still remembered to give not more than 3 stars. That is, we returned items bought on-line to this place, but the refund was much less than I anticipated since Wal-mart refund s/w dictated & used the local tax % rather than tax % from the originating warehouse. I hope, some layers will take note to start the class action. Wal-mart organization prob made some profit $ because of its refund policy.  3 stars, to me, is a bit too high although the workers are working pretty hard.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Good General store in convenient location; their corporate power allows them to sell a variety of goods very cheaply, they are expanding thier services too. Some sections are more challenging to navigate, like shoes.</text>

I like walmart, but last time i went the register i was waiting at was freezing the girl kept on asking MEL to help her and mel ignored her. This other girl nicely asked again and Mel said, IM WITH A CUSTOMER. I felt bad for this girl. I would hate to have co workers like that!< /text>

<Text>Had a horrible expericence.... I was trying to buy some laundry soap and asked an associate for help on an online price. The man told me to ask in online/web order department. The woman told me to talk to the manager to adjust the price because i couldnt order the items online. When i got to the register the lady asked another lady about price change she said they couldnt do it because it wasnt walmart website when i showed her it was the walmart app she said no. Wow! Then she called the store manager, the store manager told me she couldnt honor the walmart app price because i had to order it when i told her i tried and that i had gone thru diff people she said no. She said it was a different item so i asked her if she could show me which one it was she said no. She said it was limited stock so i asked if she could order for me then she again said no. After all that runaround no one could help me!<//Text>< Pics>

Item I saw online wasnt there. Price for a scanned item didnt match display. Price checkers were now hard to find. Not labeled well and fewer there. Staff I went to for help wasnt very helpful, didnt provide any reasonable response and didnt offer any assistance. Other than that....</Text>

Good General store in convenient location; their corporate power allows them to sell a variety of goods very cheaply, they are expanding thier services too. Some sections are more challenging to navigate, like shoes.< /Review>

If you HAVE TO go to walmart, this is the one to go to.  It might be a drive to get there but you won't be driving around in the parking lot looking for a spot.<//Review>

Warning; They don't "rotate the stock" so you can easily pick up an expired can of food and buy it. We have to check every can of food as some are 2 years old or more. Same with the mid-Simi location. Underpaid employees dont care to try that hard I suppose.< /text>

This place is horrible. The staff seems uneducated (in general.) The store is dirty and messy. Pay the extra 4¢ and go to Target.</text>
