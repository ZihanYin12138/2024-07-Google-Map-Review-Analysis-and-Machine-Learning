We have the BEST representative, Jordan Garza. Jordan is so friendly, professional he treats you as your his family, the bonus he has a beautiful smile.
Jordan was on time, answered all our questions, even when we would call or text he will/would answer immediately.  Jordan made our experience very comfortable, we really didn't have to do anything, he took care of setting everything up.  Jordan added enough panels so we do not have a true up with PG&E.  The true up's are outrageous.  We are very happy and have recommended Jordan to family and friends.   Make sure you ask for Jordan Garza when you are looking for solar.< /text>

After yrs and months of searching and researching, my family and I feel like we made the right decision with Stockdale solar. Kyle was beyond helpful, not only did he address ALL of my concerns but he was extremely patient and supportive. Not once did I feel pressure,  I actually felt like family. He is definitely one hell of a guy to have on your side, I wouldn't trust anyone else!! Thank you Kyle.
Shawn (door man) and everyone at Stockdale solar.< /Review>

He answered all my questions with such great knowledge and patience. Always willing to work with my schedule. Stockdale solar has been great so far. I got different quotes from other companies but decided to go with Stockdale. They are family owned have great customer service and so far have been on top of things specially Aristeo. Before buying solar do your research as I did and compare companies. I really recommend Stockdale Solar. Ask for Aristeo he will answer all your questions.

A bit late on posting, but we’ll deserved. I decided to go solar few months ago and wanted a local company, I had reached out before to other companies, but would not hear from any immediately or wanted to set up many appointments to discuss plans and options. I had contacted Stockdale Solar and they quickly responded. I was helped by a gentleman named David who was very knowledgeable and had a lot of great information and education about all the questions we had. David was able to quickly give us information on our options and a quote, I was also very happy that I was able to incorporate a new roof with me going solar. They took care of everything for the roof side of things and the company they used to install our new roof were very quick, professionals and hard workers. They went the extra mile every time after they completed the their work day with cleaning up everything around the house. If you’re looking to get solar I would highly recommend Stockdale Solar and ask for David although I’m sure everyone who works there would be great too.< /Review>

The service, communication, installation, and follow up at Stockdale Solar is excellent.  I was very appreciative that I was always kept informed of all my questions.  Going local was the only way to go because it provided honesty and great service.  Couldn’t be more pleased and have referred a few people.</review>

<Text>Jordan was very helpful with providing me the right information for getting solar. He set me up with enough panels to avoid a tru up at an extremely affordable price that will never increase. I recommend going with stockdale solar. If your bill is high and worried about solar panels being expensive. Go with stockdale solar they will do there research right in front of you and let you know how much you’ll save.<//Text>< Resp>

Very professional.
Tyler Patterson was always available by phone to answer any questions.

Tyler explained the entire program to us, and the company followed through exactly.

Installation was done quickly, the guys kept the area clean, and even through we had a few broken roof tiles, they were replaced by end of installation.

Thank you Stockdale/Solar for a great experience.<//Review>

We live in an area that is constantly under the assault of door to door sales people . We hear spiel feel after spiel from young men and women seeking to sell us their respective products.  Stockdale solar got my attention because they are a local company as opposed to some huge corporation that has set up shop in our community. They are a smaller company and do not carry the overhead that the other leading company’s do and therefore the savings get passed to do their customers. We have heard lots of promises but when it came down to it it just did not make sense, until we listened to Stockdale Solar. Everything went down just as they said it would. No tricks or surprises just a nice product handled by a great team that genuinely seemed to care.

Thank you Stockdale Solar

<rating>5<//rating><review>I did my research and chose Stockdale Solar, they exceeded my expectations from start to finish. The micro inverter and solar panels are the best and most efficient in the industry. The footprint is smaller than other systems I see around town. A different company designed a system at my home and theirs needed 34 panels, Stockdale Solar's are more efficient and only needed 24 panels, and the operating system on my wall is a fraction of the size of others I have seen.
I signed the contract on 7/20/17 and by 8/18/17 it was totally finished. Only 21 working days to have an engineer stop by and draw the plans, request the building permits, order the materials, and do the install. I'm very happy with the service I received from Stockdale Solar.< /review>< pictures>

I was excited to get solar on my house so I went to stockdale solar because I wanted to support “local business” the loan they gave me put a Lean on my home and can’t transfer the loan now that I’m selling my house it’s been a headache I’m basically just going to pay the loan off in full to sell my house ohhh and there is a penalty for paying them off early so my 31k dollar system is costing me 36k, also don’t believe them when they tell you they will pay you 500.00 for having a friend sign up. After I got a neighbor to sign up with them after I bought mine they kept saying they were going to send me a check but it’s been about 8 months now still no check so it’s cool keep your 500 bucks Im I’m escrow right now getting a new house and guess who I won’t be calling for solar....  on a good note the panels did look good, but customer service is bad</Text>

Stockdale Solar is a local company that offers options that are affordable and perfect for my budget. The other solar companies have high pressure salespeople that seem to be more interested in closing a deal then meeting my needs, thats not the case with Stockdale Solar as they were relaxed and come across as very genuine, highly recommend!<//Review>

We have been helping Stockdale Solar with their on-line marketing and thru personal interaction have found them to be very ethical and honest in their business dealings and would highly recommend them to home-owners considering going solar as they are affordable and provide a quality product!</text>

Eunice is amazing. My hair was completely discolored and messed up from store-bought-self-colored-gray-coverage hair coloring attempts. She fixed it and knew exactly what color to recommend & apply on me to look my best. Got endless compliments on how the new color really suits me, from countless people, even strangers.

The key here is that I have sensitive scalp and get a really bad rash reaction from regular dyes, therefore never can get my hair colored professionally at salons. However, she is able to provide & use a more natural dye on me, and the color lasts! Permanently.  =)

She is now my trusted go-to person for root touch ups for about a year now. She's friendly, approachable, sweet, efficient, and professional. When I'm too busy to visit her & try to color at home, the result is just not worth the time investment.

Appointment is definitely recommended. They get really busy. Appointments are all pretty on-time. I never had to wait when I show up on time.

I used to park on the main street until I found out there are plenty of parking behind the building, with convenient access from their back door.

Everyone who work there are really sweet, nice, and friendly. Interior Decor is modern and comfortable.</Review>

I love getting my hair cut here. The place is clean and always busy with a lot of customers. The longest I've ever waited was about 20 min. The salon is clean and there's always parking available. I bring my 9 year old son here. I get my hair cut and dyed. I have other family members that come here too. I highly recommend this place. On sundays they are open and take walk ins.</text>

Was told they take walk-ins and than said come back in 3 hours. Lol! Maybe they just dont understand the walk in concept. No problem though...found another place that did.
.
.
.
In response to the owner. I walked in asked if you take walkins... there was one client in the salon. The stylist there said yes. I said great and sat down. Than she came over with the book and let me know I could come back in three hours. Walk ins typically in most salons walk in remain in the salon and than are serviced. As I said...I dont think there is an understanding here of the concept. 🤪< /review>

<Review>Just got back from The Cutting Edge.  Pearly did a great job with my hair. As I get older, my hair is becoming thinner. All I could tell Pearly is that I wanted my hair shorter so it looked thicker. She cut beautiful layers into a shoulder length bob.  I am soooo happy. Will definitely be coming back< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

This was my first time at this place. Everyone was very nice and friendly and most important is the hair cut, which I liked very much. Am planning to go again for my hair cuts.<//review>

I've been going here for, at least, 3 years. I cannot say I've ever had a bad hair cut. The people here ask questions and make sure you are getting what you want. They have a customer for the life of their business</review>

Very fast and friendly service. Not overly priced, but still not cheap depending on hair length.</Text>

<Text>They really know what they are doing at this salon! you would expect to pay sky high prices for the type of quality service this place provides. Miriana and Eunice have both cut and colored my hair an I have been happy every time I leave. Also Tuey has cut my hair and did a great job! Did I mention my whole family goes here. 4 total ! Thanks cutting edge!< /Text>< userid>

< review>
I got a pedicure and a full acrylic set with gel nail polish and I've been getting lots of compliments on my nail color that I chose from here. My nails haven't broken and I've had them on for 3 weeks now, longest I've ever gone with nails. Everywhere else I've gone they've never lasted as long, so that makes me happy and want to go back. Only thing is when I do go here my nails are just a basic color no jewelry or designs.< /review>

They were super nice. Hannah did my nails.  She paid attention to detail, i didnt have to point out anything.  I mentioned color was a little light, she offered an extra coat. I would highly recommend, specially since im picky.  Cant say the same about the pedis.</Review>

<text>Use to have very good nail  service been going there for 4 years this past year has changed a lot last 3 times I have went for acrylics they only lasted a week then started to break I told my nail tec to make them a bit thicker since I noticed was doing them very thin she said it would be fine and I asked for them to be soaked off they said they didn’t have time I understand running a business is stressful but being rude to paying customers who just ask for it to be fixed is not ok I also had schedule appointments and showed up and no one could take me in even tho I had a appointment I hope they do better there are some very nice lady’s who do work there<//text>< pics>

I go here because it’s quick and convenient. The mani depends on the person and I guess what kind of mood they are in and the pedi depends on how busy they are too.< /Text>

<text>My daughter in law and I went. The woman who did her pedi dug the scrubber in so hard on the side of the left foot that she had a road rash. The lady who did my pedi cut my toe so bad that it wouldnt stop bleeding.  I believe it was because they were deep in conversation with each other. Mind you we had no clue what they are really saying! I find it very rude. 0 stars from me!!!<//text>< Pics>

I have no idea as to why their rating is so high . This place is absolutely terrible !!!! The ladies are very rude . I had to wait about 20 min even though I had an appointment. And I when I told her I wanted to get a different shape , she said she was going to charge extra ( which is okay) I told her Yes, and she said it was too expensive for me , and that I couldn’t afford it . When finished I payed and quickly left . I will never return again . Do not come here !< /text>

<review>Horrible experience! I came here with 2 of my cousins & we all had a very bad experience. Right when we walked in, the lady at the register greeted us rude. We asked for pedicures & she rolled her eyes & told us “ok, pick a color.” While we were looking for a polish, she rushes us & tells us to hurry. Mind you, we weren’t even ready with our polish. We practically just grabbed any color. Then, the ladies didn’t even give us any time to soak & relax our feet in the water. Everything was so rushed & careless. One of my cousins didn’t even get polish on because the lady doing her toes didn’t even trim her toe nails correctly. She was literally trimming them in a triangle shape... pointy tip & everything! After several times of my cousin trying to correct the lady & telling her she wanted regular square shape toes, she kept going deeper on the sides & making them like triangles. Finally my cousin was done & told the lady to please stop. But during this process when the lady was using a cuticle trimmer on my cousins toes, she then uses it on HERSELF! She trimmed something off her hands! Without any cleansing, Disinfecting or Sterilizing. & right after she puts it away in her kit! We about just died at this point. & couldn’t believe what horrible experience we had. Out of many salons we been to, this one is Definitely the Worst! & I do not recommend at all!<//review><Date>1560832113001</Date><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80916b642b898cbf:0xb98e4ebdedc4ce8e<//gmap_id>< rating>

I dont let anyone else do my nails. They do quality nails. They get busy though so there may be a wait but it is worth it. They are friendly. Flower and Vincent always does their best to make sure everyone is taken care of.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>went to get a waxing service done here and this place is so unprofessional and unsanitary. as I was sitting in the waiting area people kept going in and out of the room and not once did i see the lady go into the restroom and wash her hands (I didn't really make a big deal i thought maybe there was a sink in the room or something). when it was my turn I went in and I also realized there was no sink in there and the lady DID NOT wear gloves while waxing her customers. as I was getting waxed the lady also did not pull on my skin before ripping off the wax causing her to rip off some of my skin. nice looking place but will definitely not be returning to this place again.< /Text>< pictures>

So my review is primarily focused on the eyebrow waxing because this was the only reason I came to Venus nails. So I have been getting my eyebrows waxed here for 4 years and never thought about leaving a review until a recent experience I had. So I moved towns recently, therefore,  had to find a new eyebrow lady. I went to European Wax Center which sounded pretty legit. The first wax was free so that was nice.. but the actual waxing was horrible! They normally charge $21 for their eyebrow waxing compared to Venus only charging $8! Although European Wax Center did use hard wax meaning it was less painful, it took sooo much longer! My eyebrows looked nothing compared to the eyebrows I get when Flower does mine at Venus. I was sooo disappointed after my recent wax that I had to go home and fix them up myself. The point of this rant was to not take Venus’ eyebrow waxing for granted; as from now on I will only be waxing my eyebrows when I go back home. 10/10 would recommend Flower because she’s quick and works miracles!<//Review>

< Review>
So when I got there the wait was over 30 min which is do able since I was a walk in. Once I sat down with the gentleman to do my nails he treated me as if I don't go get my nails done every 2-3 weeks as needed. I also asked that my nails be thick because I work with heavy steel and don't want them to break, I did not want all the lumps and gaps so when I mentioned something you could tell the attitude he was giving me by the way he started handling my nails. I didn't want to cause a scene so I let him finish the horrible nail job he was doing, paid and left. I will never go back to this salon again. I wish I was able to show you all my nails. I have paint on my fingers and a gap that makes it look like it's been over a week since getting them done and it looks like my nails are doing the wave with how lumpy they are.</Review>

<review>Extremely poor customer service. Front desk person doesn’t even make eye contact not speak well to customers. Had me and two others wait for half an hour for someone that wasn’t even in the building. When asked why we were told to wait for someone that wasn’t working at the time, I was spoken to with a rude tone. Definitely don’t recommend this unprofessional place to anyone.< /review><resp>None<//resp>< username>

I like to get pedicures done here, not too many color options. Customer service doesn't really exist. I was standing at the counter, ready to pay and the lady looks at me like i was bothering her. Maybe I'll go elsewhere.<//Text>

< review>
I went in to get a my eyebrows waxed. I was waiting about 8-10 minutes. The whole time there was this girl getting her toes done. As I’m still there waiting the girl gets up and the lady says she needs an eyebrow wax. The lady that does the wax was sitting at the front desk the whole time doing nothing. Takes the girl back and waxes her eyebrows. I was so frustrated knowing that with in that time of the girl getting her toes done I could have gotten my eyebrows done that I just got up and walked out.<//review>

First time going and it was okay not really friendly staffed rushed me to pick my color and sit down, guy did my nails he did pretty good but they are too thin. Too thin = break easily, they're okay tho not the best but maybe some one else could do better there and who actually speaks english< /Text>

<user_name>Kyleigh& Mary< /user_name><Review>I went here to get my nails done 3 times and ended up with FUNGUS I went to get a new set and 3 weeks later I went for a fill.  Then today I went to the place across the street and the lady told me I made the worst mistake going there cause I ended up with FUNGUS on 4 if my nails and I came home and told my mom cause my grandma took me and the lady said she couldn't do anything expect go back and get my nails fixed but we told her I got them fixed today.  The customer service was HORRIBLE.  I will never go back and I learned my lesson cause my friends have gone and ended up with the same thing.  I went to a different place today cause it was  busy and I feel bad for all of those people getting a fill or new set.  I wrote this review cause I don't want other people to go and end up with the same stuff.  My mom is going to call the health department tomorrow when I am at school< /Review><Rating>1</Rating><GmapID>0x80916b642b898cbf:0xb98e4ebdedc4ce8e<//GmapID>< Pictures>

If I can give it a negative I would! I went in on Thursday and by Friday morning my toe is swollen and red ... could it be an infected or she kept digging the instruments way too hard! I am very upset and will never come here again!</review>

Avana Springs is a great community in Corona for the money. There are a lot of families in the community, which makes it feel safe. Management is very friendly and responsive, which is a huge plus. The maintenance team is beyond amazing; they are quick to address any maintenance issues and they fix the problem right the first time. They are super friendly and professional. Overall, this is a great place to live!< /text>

Absolutely terrible place to be living in. They never return your calls for maintenance issues or anything regarding billing payments. The girls in the office are literally doing NOTHING in the office and are using covid as an excuse to do even less than what they have already been doing. For some reason they have an off-site call center to handle their calls which makes absolutely no sense because obviously nobody is rushing to live here. The only upside is their maintenance manager Joe, who is absolutely amazing.< /text>

<review>Life is about more than work - or the time it takes to get you there. It’s about soaking up sun-filled days, unwinding on a calm evening, or seizing the moment whenever the time is right.

Absolutely the worst! As a former resident I can say that they have the worst management I’ve ever met. After living here for close to a year we had constant issues with terrible customer service from the leasing manager and staff, but things took an even worst turn after our apartment flooded in February due to their inadequate drainage system and heavy rain. My husband and I had to evacuate the apartment. A flood is bad enough but what has made this experience even worse is the aftermath. Now it’s been 5 months later and we have yet to receive our refund for our deposit or reimbursement for our damaged items. We were told to leave our damaged items behind in order to potentially receive reimbursement. However, now even after countless calls and email follow ups we have received nothing but the run around. The bottom line is what a terribly run complex, they will ultimately disregard your concerns and this is theft of our items and deposit! ******Beware, move in at your own risk.<//text>

We have been loving the apartment complex. The maintenance is quick and efficient and it’s amazing that they allow you to reserve spots at the pool during the corona virus pandemic. The only problem with the pool is they don’t have a pool skimmer so there are hundreds of bugs of varying sizes just floating at the top of the pool. Which makes me not want to swim because I know I’ll be getting bugs all over me.  I wouldn’t expect the staff to come and skim the pool everyday considering very few people are using it. If they could get a new pool skimmer that isn’t ripped apart then I would clean the pool whenever I’m here and it would be extremely appreciated and helpful<//review>

< review>
Honestly, if I could give no stars I would. I've had nothing but problems since moving in here. I moved into one of their "renovated and upgraded" units. I've had maintenance out here more times than I can count to fix things that keep breaking in my apartment. The back pool hasn't been open since I moved in and now that we're coming into the summer months I highly doubt they'll be opening the pool. You pay for a "gated community" when the gates just now got fixed, we're at the end of may and I moved in 12/20/19. The only reason I'd stay is for my neighbors and for the maintenance people. Other than that, I would not recommend this place. The staff tells you that they can get you into a different unit for a lower price and then when you go to the apartment it's suddenly not even an apartment and they won't give you a different unit for the price they gave you since they LIED to your face. RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. Do not bother moving in here, you'll hate it just as much as most of us do. They'll tell you the residents feel safe here when that's a bull face lie.</review>

Think all the past reviews were from previous management. Been here a good 4 months and have had nothing but a great experience. Maintenance is always on point with work orders and the laundry facilities stay clean. Tiffany from the leasing office is always very pleasant, helpful, and informative and overall the neighborhood feels safe and is quiet. The spa is dirty sometimes and every now and again you'll catch a few homeless in the trash but they mind their business. All in all, 4.6 stars 👍🏾<//Text>

< Review>
I have been living here for 9 months. My lease is almost up and I will not be renewing it. My bf and I never got to see our actual apartment before move in. We were only allowed to see a model. When my bf and I wanted to see the apartment the week before and the week of our move in date, the staff Tiffany said that our apartment was not ready yet bc it was being newly renovated. She told us that if we wanted to see it, they would charge us for an early move in date. Tiffany assured us that our apartment would be ready the day of move in. I knew that was a lie. When my family and I got here, a staff was mopping and cleaning the floor. smh. the only thing that was renovated was the kitchen. it is really nice, however the bathroom was disgusting upon move in.  Also, Tiffany told us that they ordered the wrong washer and dryer, bc the appliances were too big, causing the laundry door not to close. She said they were going to come and get us a different one, and they never did. I really hate that the washer and dryer is outside on the patio bc it is such an inconvenience when doing laundry at night, especially when that nasty black rat is running around. My bf and I realized that the avana scammed us into thinking we were renting a 2 bed 1 bath, but the 2nd room is really an office or den, even my neighbors told me this. The second room doesn't even have a real closet nor a real bedroom door.  Also, My bf and I applied to two other apartments and Avana springs were the only property to tell us that we had to put down a high security deposit based on our credit report. The other two properties never asked for a high security deposit. And now I wonder if Avana is scamming renters into giving them high down payments. When I was in the office one day, i overheard the staff calling prospective tenants and she told all of them that they were offered the apartment with conditions, which is to give a higher downpayment. The utilities make my rent go up at least $130. my screen door is always falling off, its super cheap and these raggedy blinds. the dishwasher is too big so i cant even open it all the way bc the stove is too big and blocking the way. these people dont know how to measure when they order appliances smh. the drawers are not put on correctly. they are lopsided. everything in this place just falls apart. also this unit is way too small. This place does not deserve my hard earned $. the only thing good i can say about this apt is that maintenance is fast and very friendly/the kitchen is nice.<//Review>

<Text>First, the rent is going up and you don't get anything in return for the increase.  Their management says it's fair market value is based on the area. There's nothing in this area to do and you  shouldn't base the rent compared to other newer apartments in the area which offer more.   I just had a couple moved in above me that have children and you can hear the children running and jumping all the time. The walls are so thin that you can have children or adults for that matter  yelling and screaming. You can hear the toilets flushing from the apartment above you or below you. And you can even hear people using the toilet at times.  The walls are very thin. The management allows children to skate board inside the apartment which makes noise.  Kids are constantly playing around cars and  putting nicks and scratches on cars.  You can hear kids cussing outside because the walls are so thin. You can hear the kids playing and yelling outside all the time during the day when they are not in school.  If you work nights, I would not recommend this place. If you're looking for a peaceful apartment complex I would not recommend this place. I will not be renewing my lease.  Just look at all the negative reports and their response from  management. It is pretty much the same scripted response. This proves they really don't care. They lure  you EN with cheap deals and then they stick it to you.  If you live in the lower apartment you can hear people walking and the ceiling squeak. With all the negative reviews, people have much to believe what they are saying must be true.   Pay a little more somewhere else and you can get a washer and dryer in your apartment. Good luck if you move in here.< /Text></record>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Absolutely worse apartment complex in Corona. If i could give them no rating I would.   The apartment complex is full of roaches. I moved in after selling my home and soon after moving in roaches started appearing. I have been asking them to fumigate again since the summer and we are going into the new year and they still havent done it. Maintenance personnel goes into apartments without permission and when you arent home. The refrigerator in the unit broke down and i put in a maintenance request along with other minor issues, it took over two weeks for them to finally replace the appliance. The office personnel is incompetent.  They'll refuse payment saying you dont have a lease signed, theyll call you telling you are late on your rent even though your payment has posted and cleared. They claim there is security at night but there isnt. My car was once damaged while parked at night, but they have no cameras or security. The apartment are also overpriced for the size and have no storage. The cabinets in the kitchen are really small, there is no pantry or hall closet to store vacuum etc. It always smells like weed at night and this past year the pool was out of service the majority of the summer. You'll regret renting here, I sure am.< /Review>< GmapID>

In the beginning, we thought this place was amazing. Beautiful grounds, nice staff, fairly nice units...we didn't realize the truth until we lived here for a couple months. We've had problems with a neighbor who is just downright aggressive, we've notified management multiple times but nothing can be done but to call the PD if we have another interaction with him...the sides of the apartment units are overrun with cobwebs and dust and wasp nests, it doesn't appear that anyone comes by to power wash or clean off the walls so we're constantly walking through spiderwebs on a daily basis. I asked about roaches before we signed a lease and we were told they haven't had a single complaint-we've had roaches in our unit since day two (we clean every other day, and there's never any open containers or food sitting out - the first reaction is to always blame the tenant but obviously multiple people are having this issue), everywhere from the living room to the bathrooms to the bedroom. We've notified management and they said they would take care of it, and nothing.  Its so hard to get a hold of the staff over the phone, I have to call so many times over a period of a few days in order to even get someone to answer. Lastly, the staff in the office rotates so frequently, we hardly recognize faces for longer than a couple months. We are breaking our lease and moving. It's not worth paying what we're paying in rent to live around a neighbor who makes us hesitant to even be around him and to not only put up with the filth both inside and outside the complex, but to also put up with staff who makes you feel like they just brush off your complaint. We've been asking when the back pool will be opened, for moths we've hear "in a couple weeks." In the meantime, the front pool is getting so overcrowded we can rarely enjoy it. Same thing with the gym, we've been told it's close to opening and seems like it never does. On top of it, when talking with the staff regarding why we're breaking our lease we still have to pay the fee to terminate it regardless of the problems we've had with the complex and our neighbor...but whatever we can do to get ourselves out of here we will so I guess we're at a loss on that one.</text>

<Review>this is what my wife and I have to come home to every day. we can’t even correctly park on our spot due to our rude neighbor. My wife had a brand new car, not new anymore after these people moved in and dinged her car all over the place. the parking spots are already narrow, and the more we park away to the left from this person the more room she feels she has to park towards our spot. There is no escape from this person, we have asked politely several times. still waiting for a different parking spot from the leasing office  so we can switch.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>I honestly can't imagine any of the past reviews being relevant anymore. I love this place.. Ive been living here for close to 6 months and not only was the apt  clean and up-to-date, but the staff have always been friendly and understanding. The very few times I needed maintenance they were there same day.

I suggest you come for yourself instead of listening to disgruntled people. It's a great place to live.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcc839b5f4240d:0xdfc75040019abd54</gmapID>< Rate>

<username>Michael Covarrubias< /username><date>1551488490345<//date><rate>3</rate><Text>First time reviewer from someone who actually lives here.

Warning I'm going to try and go over as much as I can.

I think most of the 1 - 2 star reviewers are either being really dishonest or I seem to be a lucky one.

Me and my girlfriend moved in almost a year ago to this date and honestly can't complain too much.

There are kids that can be loud and run around. That's to be expected in the daytime hours. What do you expect living in an apartment complex. If you wanted complete peace and quiet mid day your expectations are already in the wrong place.

We didn't have bugs for about 8 months but now cocroaches have started to come out. We keep our place clean and noticed our upstairs neighbor was evicted. I got a glimpse inside and it was disgusting. Literally open food and fast food drinks all over the kitchen. I'm almost positive that has something to do with the bugs. We're handling the problem.

Parking is fine and what you'd expect.

It's usually quiet around night and not too crazy.

Theres a gym that is taken care of, and at least where I live they do a good job at keeping the outside tidy.

The only REAL issue I have is with one particular staff member who genuinely comes off rude. I don't expect special treatment.

Complaining about rent is almost childish. You're an adult if you don't like the price for what you get then move on. Find something within your means.

May be a little presumptuous of me but I've  seen police come and go to a few apartment s on the regular and it wouldn't shock me too much if these are the type of people leaving the 1 star reviews.

As someone who's lived in apartment almost all my life this is pretty much standard fair. Not spectacular but definitely not 1-2 stars.

EDIT

Also the ONE time we've needed a service it was literally taken care of the next day.

Being someone who's worked in an industry where you deal with people I know EVERYONE can't be serviced at once and a little patience goes a long way.< /Text>< Pictures>

If i could give it a zero, I would. Terrible manegment, they are try to trick you into payong for things you shouldnt. Had a bee infestation, entire bottom floor of my build got flooded and ruined people things because they dont have proper drainage. I had to put huge bags over my legs to even get through the water to get to the stairs to my apartment. They are extremely rude. I came in to complain that maintnance never showed up to fix things and the maneger laughed. DO NOT rent here. They will just try to rip you off and take wvery penny they can from you. Could never list all of the terrible things about ris place, as there are too many. Also a guy in the apartment next to mine was constantly scream that he wanted to kill himself and everyone else (super comforting when youre trying to fall asleep) cops were called multiple times and I complained multiple times to the office as it is terrifying to hear, especially with the walls being so thin. They did nothing about it and even told me that the persons lease only had one woman on it and no reports of any type of male or second peraon for that matter. They truly don't care about you, your safety, or your happiness living in their complex.</review>

Honestly I really wish I would have chosen a different apartment complex to call home. I just moved in and I have had nothing but problems since the day I moved in. They tell you that they just remodeled but when you actually move in you will find out quickly that their version of remodeling is at the cheapest price possible because literally EVERYTHING has fallen apart. I really shouldn't be experiencing so many issues the first week I've moved in. Issues that they should have happily fixed immediately instead of waiting a day or two to get to. I'm so upset that this has been happening. So if you are looking at these apartments I recommend looking elsewhere.</text>

We have a guy storing his 5 cars, managers are aware and they don't do anything about it, there is never parking. Gates are not secured. Drug deals going on in public my pool area. People jumping fences from across the street to use pool, but pool is closed for tenants, they are getting city permits is there excuse, nope my friend works for the city and there hasn't been anything filed. I got my tire caps stolen, who does that! My neighbor down stairs got her wallet stolen , people there are in section 8 housing and don't have regular jobs , so all they do is stock other tenants and see what they can get from them. Washer and Dryers facilities are a joke! people are rude they leave their laundry and leave . I can't wait to get the HELL out! This is HELL!!!!! Oh failed to mention , people have dogs that are running around without leashes  poop in grass, smells gross.Yes the apartments are going through a re model, but no dates are given as to when they will be fully remodeled. Gym is not open, pool is not open, and waiting for my washer and dryer to be installed!  When is this going to get done?

<Review>I lived here for 3 years and I love it! That is until new management came in. PLEASE READ MY REVIEW IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY LIVING THERE SO THAT WHAT HAPPEN TO ME DOES NOT HAPPEN TO YOU!!!! We started to move out on a Sunday I personally went to the office and told them we would not be done moving our stuff by the time their office close therefore we still needed the key since both my husband and I work in Orange County we leave before they open and come back once they are already close. I asked how can we turn in the keys to them? The nice lady told me to leave the keys and paperwork in the apartment and called then the next day maintenance will pick up the keys. So that's exactly what we did, but guess what two weeks later I got a called from the assistant and asked me why had we not pay our rent? I explain to her we had already moved out and we left the keys and paperwork in the apartment as we were instructed by her employee.  After many phone calls trying to speak to them and settle this no over pick up or called us back.  My husband went to the office from Orange County to Corona to settle this we have phone records to prove how many times we called and if needed to I will pickout the girl who told me to leave the keys on the apartment to prove I was not lying.  The assistant manager was unwilling to help and said she would look into it and call us. Maintenance was already working in the apartment before this was even settle with us.  We never once received any phone call from their management.  Now we got collectors calling us and sending us bills of $1,200 for unpaid rent.  We are gonna have to go to court to resolve this because they were unwilling to contact us like they said they were.   PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN DOCUMENTATION OF EVERYTHING AS YOU SEE THEIR WORD MEANS NOTHING AND THEY WILL NEVER TRY TO CONTACT YOU.  THEY WILL TRY TO GET AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY CAN FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE CHOOSING TO LEAVE!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1487283157101, 'text': 'Hi Yadira,\nPlease contact our office directly at (951) 371-1055 so that we can speak with you.

I just moved in today and let me tell you my experience from the very beginning! The entire staff have been extremely nice from the day of my tour to the day of my move-in! Always had a smile on their faces and had great personalities and made me feel comfortable unlike other apartments I have went to go check out prior. They have been beyond helpful with all my questions and concerns! I loved how they gave me a tour of the actual apartment that we would be moving into, rather than a model apartment....like other apartments! So you're able to see how clean it is and check out the environment! Now let me tell you about the apartment. This is my very first.....I'm going to call it MY HOME, and not an apartment! It is breathtaking inside. I have the 1 bedroom, 1 bath and it's just me and my boyfriend. The kitchen is so big and gorgeous! Might I add that it has sooooo many cabinets and drawers! The bathroom seems like a master bathroom! Stunning! I have NO complaints! To the people in charge of The Springs....thank you so much for creating my dream apartment, thank you for hiring a friendly staff, and thank you for building an amazing place! And I love the parking!! To anyone reading this, I definitely recommend this place!</Text>

They move you into Apartments that are not ready and the maintenance department (2 guys) are always there invading your privacy.
Parking lot is always dirty and there are a lot of crashed/abandoned vehicles or with expired tags, Because they know the staff they get away with it.

We will wait and see where we go from here. We signed a lease to move in and the day before we move in they advise us they had pest control problems. Mind you before we found out we actually walked in to ask for the status of the apartment. The lack of communication is going to be the story of your life here. Transferred over to a different unit, come to find out they didn't clear rat infestations, 1st night rat scratching a box of dog biscuits... call maintenance... it's not an emergency so I guess they are leaving it up to us to fix their many woes.< /Text>

Staff is lazy, both office and matinence. Had a lot and of problems with our apartment and mantinence would only be there five minutes and problem would be fixed.

I was looking for a new residence before my lease ended at Parcwood. The staff here were pathetic. I ended up losing $100 deposit because no told me I had gotten accepted for residency after leaving 3 voicemails and multiple emails. I spoke to the Manager, Sandra, who didn't return my calls and was unwilling to return my $100 deposit even with proof that they never announced my acceptance to the complex.  Mind you I let them know I was a single parent, working in Irvine, and needed a response in my voicemails. I ended up signing a new lease hurriedly at a different complex.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Where do I begin. The rent is too high for such crapping apartments. They over charge you on water bill. If you decide to do laundry at the facilities and you leave it unattended for 5 minutes, it gets stolen. Parking is very limited and when you do find parking expect dents and scratches on your vehicle. They claim its a very secure place/gated area, half the entry areas dont lock. People that live across the street constantly uses the facilities at this apartments because the "gated areas" dont work properly. Spiders outside the complex around the bushes, parking area, etc are a problem here, and I am not talking about little spiders, I am talking about full grown spiders. It doesnt matter how much you clean, this place is infested with cockroach.  If you decide to move in, make sure you move appliances around and inspect for cleaning, be very detail, the management does when you leave the place, they even try to tell you by law is required to clean carpets before leaving, the contract doesnt state that, and thats what the security deposit is for. But if you dont mind any of above mention then this place is perfect for you.<//Review>< pics>

I first saw OAN when I was in Eurasia.. They were saying things I knew weren't True and they were so Anti-American. I watch for hours as they would replay the samething over and over. I figured since I was so close to Ruassia it was a Russian propaganda network..
It seems so real, except I knew certain  things were wrong and not true. I still found it fascinating because they sound like they were American but it looked and felt funny. It is interesting after many years later they are now broadcasting here in America. This fake new. Listen and you will realize it is only them say what they are saying and that they will eventually say something you know just isn't true but they make it sound good.. Humm.... I wonder if I could get a job there.... It would be interesting and I bet they pay well too.</Text>

Great News And Travel channel. Professional crew, Modern and automated HDTV news studio complete with anchor desk, talk shows, etc, a very nice right leaning addition to all the left leaning major news networks ...
Very market minded and ultra competitive, great way to sell your luxury goods like real estate and yachts on their second travel and luxury channel... just contact them about getting exposure for your brand... very nice to have such an all around world class new media package all here in San Diego< /review>

You report the news the way it's supposed to be reported.  Even during the  Peter Jennings era when they tried to keep the news unbiased you top even them!  Your commercials are educational.  You cover more information in 15 minutes than most news media cover in an hour.  You are straight to the point without all the 'personal opinions'.

Please keep it honest and fair.  You are so worth watching.
Thanks, Kate<//Review>

THIS IS THE BEST NEWS ANYONE CAN GET. THESE FOLKS READ BETWEEN THE LINES AND GET THE FACT AND THE TRUTH STRAIGHT. IF YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING SECRETS OF POLITICIANS, JUST STUDY THE INFORMATION OF CLARIFICATION THAT COMES FROM GRAHAM LEDGER AND LIZ WHEELER. THEY ARE THE SAVIORS OF JOURNALISM AND SHOULD BE AWARDED FOR THEIR RESEARCH AND HEROIC EFFORTS TO MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR THE UNDER-EDUCATED PUBLIC.</Review>

I would like to say to other people giving these reviews there's a difference between the people reporting the news and commentary, the news reported on this station is just that news . It's very refreshing to see the good work OAN does.</text><date>1468884783166</date>< gmapID>

My daughter worked for the SO-Called company and because of their lack of completing training she found that there are many issues. This company hired her and then in less than three months was doing three jobs without being trained on two of the jobs they handed her. She then went to Finance/HR and spoke to them about concerns. In the same day that she went to HR she was fired for what she discussed. There is no HR and the hiring process is very unprofessional. Firing someone for what doing the right thing is so very unprofessional. Not to mention some of their ethics are very unprofessional and not ethically right. Stay away from this company and be careful what you are buying . Ask a lot of questions and understand what you are getting into. I am HR and I know a persons Labor Rights.<//review>

Graham Ledger please educate yourself on the physiological facts of transgender persons.  These people are BORN with the physiological aspects of the gender they identify with, not necessarily the aspects of their genitalia.  Get your head out of your a__, please.  I tend to agree with most of your political opinions, but couldn't disagree with you more on the topic of transgender.  And how many transgender people do you actually know, personally?< /review>

The best news, commentary and documentary shows around.  TRULY nice to see the segments regarding the US constitution and US history (NICE WORK).  May your teams broadcast audience continue to grow.  More people need to watch OANN for the truth.  The OANN team is collectively the best bar none.  If you ever need support, don't hesitate to contact me.

I hope that when  One American New advertises, they will advertise one "Made in American" business each day. That is the only advertisements I will view. They make me feel so good to see Americans working. Otherwise I will "fast forward" or  switch channels.< /review>

The Graham Ledger show is THE BEST news show on cable news!  This station SHOULD be available through EVERY CABLE PROVIDER - Many of my friends (I belong to a republican women's group) are contacting their cable providers, like Cox, Direct-TV to demand that this station be available to them.  I encourage anyone reading this that can only view One America News thru the internet to call your provider and demand that your provider carry this station!  Graham Ledger is terrific!  love this show -<//review>

<Text>The news is truthful and like the lack of commercials. My only problem is a few of the young reporters repeat themselves but hopefully experience and time will cure this. A nice change from the network and other cable news on tv. The breaks which are snippets of American history are excellent mini-history lessons.<//Text><user_id>103401776217148836291<//user_id>< username>

<Text>This is by far THE BEST news network you'll ever find. Forget all the other "news" networks - they don't even come close. So if you're tired of CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, FoxNews and all the rest of them - subscribe and watch real, professional, interesting, intriguing, informative news. Their programs are killers one after the other. And most of all - you'll never yawn at the screen when they are on it. I guarantee you.<//Text>< Time>

I appreciate that the channel hires young journalists, however, please give them some training.  Too many of the off camera reporters sound like high schoolers reading "what I did on summer vacation' reports.  I like the channel but the immature sounding reporters and lack of presentation skills  has become genuinely irritating.< /Text>

They omit relevant facts and make false statements to slant towards a mostly "Right Leaning" Viewpoint.  I don't mind hearing a "Right Wing" Point of View but Lying about Well Known Facts to mislead people does not make for a Well Informed Opinion if you don't want to be manipulated.  I will continue to only use this Network as a Biased Point of View source.  Anyone that Advertises on it should also be viewed as Suspicious like Ads on Fox News like Gold is actually a Good Investment.< /text>

I find Graham ledger's commentary excellent and so germane––so veritas.  I've heard Liz Wheeler also make excellent comments. Their general news reporting is also well done and informative. I'll continue to watch OAN every evening!

I really like OAN news as it is very fair and much less biased reporting the political news. All the others stations are very one sided, which i don't like.
OAN reports on more important world and domestic news. I like the fact it is family owned. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. I will continue watching.</review>

<review>First there were the Networks,after that Cable CNN etc. Then came FOX wich is becoming a mixed bag. Just recently we got OAN.This is the right way news should be . No bias, straight forward,what a welcome change.

We San Diego patriots value truthful news coverage, and are highly appreciative of OANN's forthright reporting and opinions. We reject cable/satellite services that will not include OANN in their line-up.<//Text>

Liz Wheeler & Graham Ledger are the best! They cut through any left wing nonsense with insight and call them out when the lefties try to change the subject.  As we all see, the Democratics l& Progessives can never answer a logical question. They have a habit of changing the subject because they have no answer.</Text>

<text>'OANN' - One America News Network is always realistic news, not fake news! We listen to much of it daily and their news casting helps us provide a relevant Facebook web page which we have nurtured daily for about 18 months. Our web page is titled "Californians For President Trump". Our weekly reader numbers are between 9,000 and 65,000 per week. Besides being pro-President Trump, we are also anti-Gov. Brown. ....OANN Also has very limited advertising which means they are not swayed by the money-pool! Thank you OANN for giving us a huge change from the Liberal Media!</text><user>104959201651393035680<//user>< Pics>

But, I remember seeing a graphic on OAN about "the President's War on the Police". This is absurd... complete loss of credibility. Then, some OAN blonde says 'even rocks can tell Hillary Clinton is lying'. Sounds like a professional bimbo. Can she and her rocks tell when Trump is lying?</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Tobacco Island is the go-to source in Corona for all things Vape and Smoke related. This shop is the best in town. The selection of products and accessories is large and always well stocked. Even if it wasn't though, this would still be the go-to spot. Why? Because the customer service is exceptional! Fair, fast, and friendly service here and never anything less. They care about and listen to their customers, and you will know this on your first visit. The glass selection, which is what I come to browse usually, is EXCELLENT! I used to drift all the way to Van Buren for my glass - not since I washed up on Tobacco Island! Stop by, because they definitely have what you seek and more!

Long Live the Island!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Bought a smok Nord from here. Upon opening, it was defective. After trying to exchange it, they refused to swap it, and said it needs to be sent in.

I would understand this if I had used it and it became defective, but it was dead out of the box. This is not a proper way of doing business. Now I have to spend money shipping it to the manufacturer when companies will exchange it through the merchant if it’s defective. Will never shop here again. Do not buy anything electronic from here because if it’s defe, you’re at fault<//review>

<text>Do NOT shop at "Tobacco Island" in corona, they will rip you off, they sell faulty items. I was basically told too bad about my grill I just bought this month that broke. I was told they weren't responsible for their items they sell that break 2 weeks later. He has no signs saying no refund or exchanges, and basically does not care about the costumer coming first. Point being don't be deceived by their cheap prices cause you clearly pay for what you get. I will NEVER spend another penny on that place. Beware you all have been warned! Go to "tobacco crush" they are way nicer and cheaper on cigs!< /text>< pictures>

Very nice guy was in charge when we went. Didnt have the cigar I wanted (the 1400cc), so he promised to order it for next time AND gave me a discount on a more expensive cigar (the Kuba Kuba). Will ABSOLUTELY be back.

UPDATE: Went back to buy more cigars, the people who work there are some of the nicest people I have met. The prices here are absolutely amazing! I love this place so much. Cant recommend it enough!

Did I mention that I love this place?<//Review>

<Review>The store is clean and prices are fair. The only down side is that the homeless like to sleep out on the sidewalk in front of all the businesses along that part of the strip mall. Use caution as they are usually either on drugs or suffer from some sort of psychological problem.</Review>< Date>

I went in and asked the guy what would be a good cigar for a first time smoke, He had no knowledge of any of the cigars, wasn't helpful at all. Also not a very large cigar section.<//Review>

<Review>I’ve been going here for 3 years. No other salon is as great. Seriously the greatest salon/haircut I’ve ever gotten in my life. Rim and Lin are so consistent with their haircuts. So friendly and great pricing. I extremely extremely recommend this place.<//Review>< pics>

Amazing place they are very well mannered and really know how to cut hair the way you like. They are so good I've been getting my hair cut for 8 years. Prices are very reasonable also.< /text>

<text>Sorry but we've had much more delectable and delicious dimsum in other places. All the dishes we tried here were very soggy and extremely over-cooked/over-steamed.
State Street in Santa Barbara had throngs of diners in restaurants lining up the entire street which made eating dinner more interesting. But it was a regrettable food experience in this restaurant.</text>< pics>

<Text>Can’t describe but here is a shot: 1.  NOT hand made. The outer shell on the spinach dumpling was store bought and freezer burnt. 2. Shrimp Dumpling...also out of a bag. 3.  Vegetable spring roll is full of “haiku sai” or white lettuce roots. We found one carrot string in the 3 rolls.

Why 1 Star?  Outdoor ambience was great!  Weather was perfect and everyone basically was mask compliant. Next time...back to the Boathouse at the beach.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I feel so bad having to say this, but the food here is for the most part either simply disappointing or awful. My wife is more forgiving because being Chinese she enjoyed chatting with the server who was friendly enough.

The dishes are uniformly over priced and in terms of taste, the vast majority taste like they came from the freezer. Portions on certain dishes are comically small: the gailan (Chinese broccoli) looked great in the menu photo, but was a mere few pieces, mostly random cuttings in reality. The Xialong Bao (pork soup dumplings) are at any other place served in portions of eight to ten in a basket; here only four! The char siu (bbq pork) had little flavor of any sort and came poorly plated. The Char siu bao (bbq pork buns) were edible but again the pork filling wasn't flavorful. They have a dish of pork in a black bean sauce that traditionally would contain pumpkin and often some jalapenos. Here the dish was simply fatty pork bits with no real meat and a few stray black beans.

So what was good? Well, the rice porridge with pork was okay but a little too watery according to my wife. The steamed rice cakes filled with pork which are a Cantonese dish and come wrapped in lotus leaf were fine. And they have a radish cake (daikon radish) that actually was good because it wasn't dry and clearly contained real radish. The Sesame Balls that are fried with a red bean filling were pretty good, but again likely originally frozen and the Siu Mai (pork with shrimp) was passable but you will do better elsewhere.

Other reviewers have complained that the dumplings here aren't made fresh. And truthfully, most Chinese dumpling houses do not make their own dumplings. They source them from either a few restaurants that have the resources to do so, or from companies that supply the industry or in this case, the frozen section of a grocer.  My wife and I have been told this numerous times from several restaurants in Los Angeles Chinatown and in San Francisco, including from managers. So in that note, Asie Dumpling House isn't alone.

Anyway. Staff are friendly, but many including Emily, our server, don't have great English skills but try their best. And yeah, it's over priced here.</Review>

We had the shrimp dumplings which were pretty good,  though the dipping sauce was not terribly tasty. Also the bean curd rolls which were awful. It appeared that they were fried but then kept warm with steam. Limp and tasteless. My friend had the ramen. Noodles and an egg in an odd broth. She didn't like it, thought it needed more flavor. The service was okay, very friendly. The bill was very cheap. We were so looking forward to a dumpling restaurant and it was less than mediocre.  It's a pretty new place, so hopefully they'll improve. We'll wait a couple of months and try again.</Review>

<Review>Simply Incredible! Stop here for delicious authentic food and attentive service.  From Dim Sum to Hot Pot you can try your favorites or some new things.  Even if you have never had these things before, you will still walk away pleased and fulfilled.

Now be aware if you have never done dim sum. They are not large portions so start with 2 or 3 items and order more to satisfy your appetite.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Ok for a convenient craving of dumplings, they have a good selection. I came here after work during Covid etc. So I took my food to go, wish I could eat it there. The items I got were  kind of bland compared to other dim sum shops I've been to. But at least I can come here if I'm really craving some type of dim sum and dumplings! Really had to utilize the dipping sauces that came with my order. A d I also ordered the duck, which was very bony. Staff was fine!<//Review>

< Review>
It's a mom&pop restaurant,they made the chicken/pork/beef/shrimp dumplings themself in the morning, while bought other stuff from supplier in L.A. Those dumplings were kept frozen. That's why Xiao long baos, shrimp dumplings, etc take 15 minutes to steam then serve.

It's not a secret nowadays that some of the foods are premade products from other suppliers, frozen food and prepared food are big industries.<//Review>

GUYS, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LONGER WAIT TIME THAN ANY OTHER RESTRAUNT. THEY ALWAYS GET THE RECIEPT WRONG WITH NUMBERS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE( you ordered 1 coke, BUT LATER IN THE RECIPT THEY SAY 2.) also I’m not blaming this on the waiter because he was good and fast at responding but blaming it on the restaurant itself  BUT THEY ALWAYS FORGET AND MORE CONS INTO IT.< /text>

Mediocre food.  Service lousy.
Ordered Tall Glass of Ice Water and Ice Tea.  Got a coffee cup of Ice water.  Asked for Tall Glass Water again and Sugar for my tea.  Brought sweetener.  Asked for sugar.  Got sweetener.  Asked for sugar.  Dont have sugar only sweetener.... okay...
Finally got tall ice water!

Ordered two lunch specials plus edamame and chicken feet.  Hot soup was warm .... lunch came....waited for edamame and chicken feet.  Asked about them.  No edamame, sorry.  Order something else?  No, I'm almost done with lunch.  Chicken feet? Yea yea coming.  Chicken feet arrive.  Not whole feet cut in half!  $6 for (2) feet.
Not very flavorful.   Lack of spices

Was looking forward to a new place!
Big disappointment!</Text>

Really not good food. No flavor on the rice or the lo mein. Chicken was not crispy at all, rather on the soggy side. Will not be ordering from here again. On top of that - way more expensive than usual Chinese takeout. Yuck!< /review>

Kung Pao Shrimp was great, as in plenty of shrimp and very tasty. I also ordered spinach dumplings and was not so impressed with those but will try a different appetizer next time. Good value$.< /Review>

A pleasant, comfortable place to eat. I went there for Dim Sum accompanied by some Hong Kong ladies, and...well, it fell far short of expectations. B for effort, C for realisation. Wouldn't it be great to have a bustling dim sum joint in Santa Barbara, with trolleys and all? It wasn't terrible. It was OK.</Text>

The peppered steak was undercooked (aka raw in the middle) and the basil chicken was a bizarre rubbery texture. Don't bother eating here.</Review>

This place was about what you’d expect for asian food in SB.  Food itself was decent but portions were quite small - we were especially disappointed in the Chinese broccoli and egg tarts.  Service was questionable and the restaurant felt quite understaffed.< /text>

This is the place to go when you have to have hand surgery. I brought my mom here for severe carpal tunnel of her right hand. Dr. Yalom and her caring team made my mom feel very comfortable and well cared for.  Her surgery has had a fabulous recovery and she is able to paint again.  I recommend Regional Hand Center to everyone!< /text>

I have been there multiple times and the staff is very warm and welcoming. The physicians are compassionate, down to earth and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend Regional Hand Center for your "hand" needs. It is truly a 5 star experience.<//text>

My surgery experience I had here over 1 year ago was exceptional, as was the overall treatment and care provided by staff. Now understand, my opinion is biased (because I also work here - going on 4 years), but here are some facts: not every interaction may be the best, but we constantly strive to better ourselves and patient customer service. If you are wanting surgery, plan for the wait, whether it’s 1 hour or 5- plan to be flexible. Any surgery (at any facility) can go longer than expected, which does indeed cause others’ wait times to grow, but wouldn’t you want that extra time spent on you if you were having surgery? I can’t speak for other specialty outpatient facilities, but Regional Hand Center exceeds itself by offering emergency services to countless patients, which also delays others’ wait times.. all we ask is for patience and understanding in these situations. Again, what if the tables were turned? I work the late hours, and it can be rough. BUT, at the end of the day, if you want a great outcome for your trigger finger, carpal tunnel, radius fracture or revision amputation, the wait is worth it because these surgeons definitely do it best! I work alongside all 4 of them, and am proud to represent them and this facility. Everyone has their own opinion, but take them all with stride.. Come make your own, and remember that one bad experience doesn’t compare to the hundreds of great ones.</Text>

<Review>Don't make an appt unless you want to wait here 2 hours to be seen!! I drove an hour from Lemoore to be seen by Dr. Galli. My appt time was for 10 am and I arrived at 920 am to fill out any paperwork which only took me less than 10 min to fill out. I had to make child care arrangements and needed to leave by 11:15  to pick my child up by 12:15 thinking it shouldn’t take more than hour to be seen. Mind you not once was I told it would be a 2 hour wait just to be seen! Never was I told on the phone that he "always runs behind" so plan accordingly. I just wasted my gas, time and money on child care for nothing!!! They could careless!! All I got was a sorry we can reschedule you. Thanks for nothing but I will take my business else where. When I asked if they could compensate me for gas and child care that I wasted, they ignored my request.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1566932622713, 'text': 'Thank you Estefanie for posting your review on google as well.

I had a very positive experience this morning for my Carpel Tunnel Surgery! EVERYONE their was so kind and personable. They were prompt, thoughtful, caring and very thorough with me the whole time I was there! Once the re-coup of my right hand is done, Dr. Yalom will do the same process on my left hand.</Text>

< review>
I had a procedure done in December here at Regional Hand Center with Dr. Galli. Dr. Galli was extremely attentive and made sure to address all concerns and questions in great detail. He kept me informed throughout the whole pre--op process, during surgery, and post surgery. All of the nurses were continuously checking up on me while in recovery to make sure I was comfortable before going home. His staff followed up with me a week after to check on me and asked if I had any additional questions. I would recommend Regional Hand Center to anyone who wants the highest level of care,  I cannot speak highly enough about them.< /review>

Regional Hand Center is outstanding when it comes to patient care and getting this done in a timely matter. Very knowledgeable doctors who take their time in explaining your diagnosis in detail and answering all your questions and concerns. I recommend this office to all family and friends!!!
My little brother was treated by Dr. Avena for multiple warts on multiple fingers a couple years ago. We had tried everything possible and bought everything in store shelves to try and get rid of those warts before we came to Regional Hand Center. Dr. Avena took the time to explain everything to my parents and his recommendation for treatment. We were pleased that it was extremely invasive and painless considering he was dealing with a teenager.
It only took one round of cryotherapy to get rid of all those nasty warts. They have yet to come back!!! Thank you Dr. Avena your the best!!!<//Review>

Stehr, Ileana Cervantes, M.S., PA-C, Eric Wagoner, M.S., PA-C, Roy C. Ouano, MBA, PA-C deliver the best surgical care for the hand with a sense of dedication and professionalism.

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I had a bad experience with surgery scheduling.  We prayed if they were the right doctor..and we met the staff and..they were really not a fit.  It was linda like dealing with the customer service from Philippines with over information and no answer to problems.  Doing a cash pay of 1100 office use and the rest to surgeon.  That was nice, just so many migrants talking about being injured in hand surgery.  And bad experience somewhere else..three days later after surgery on leg a family member died of blood clout.  So if I ask a lot questions it's because I need to know.  But they will argue all day with you.  Just pray

Update- Was contacted immediately after expressing my concerns regarding Regional Hand Center.  They took my concerns to heart, corrected the issue I was having and I am now scheduled for surgery.

<Review>I saw Dr Stehr for arthritic tendonitis and surgery was recommended. He told me the surgery scheduler would call within 3 days.  While I waited for that call I had a lot of time for research and was feeling overwhelmed with how the Dr did not tell me about the possible  side effects for  surgery on my dominant hand. No problem because I didn't  get a call to schedule surgery for 12 days. So now I'm  seeing a different doctor in a different office soon. My gut told me that if scheduling was a problem that there would be further issues with this office. Only gave two stars because I liked Dr. Stehr's "bedside manner."</Review>< Response>

<Review>Even though I do work for this company I have to say they are the most amazing group of people in the world. I had surgery about 2 months ago by Dr. Avena and he was incredible. I don’t really have a visible scar, he always checked in with me on my pain. His team mate Ileana is one of the most caring PA’s I have ever met. She may be little and fast, but her patient care is always number one. Shakindra is always there working hand in hand to make sure things get done. When I had questions about my surgery they were right there to answer all of them. Amazing group of people. Keep up the great work!< /Review><response>{'time': 1531171825085, 'text': 'Thanks Tasha, I enjoy being a part of the same team!

Our front desk personnel checks in patients and notifies the appropriate employees.  We do our best to cross train employees but with our growing practice we have a lot of new hires who have joined our team.  With that being said, unless a patient speaks with the appropriate department regarding their question like our referral department who works with all new patients, it may be a little challenging to receive the information needed for their questions and/or concerns.  All insurance companies have different requirements and limitations and unfortunately limit the ability for our office to help the patient if we are not contracted or in network. All HMO insurance carriers only allow their primary physicians to refer or create orders for treatment or service and unless we have a signed release form we are also unable to forward documents to another provider. Our mission is to deliver the best care for each patient who enters our facility with a sense of friendliness and professionalism. Our employees should direct all patients to the correct personnel to help address questions, including cost for visits and treatments.

I called the front desk to inform them I had Medi-Cal. Which they saw me anyways. Doctor was great very friendly and funny. Doc Said, "he couldnt cast me because of my insurance." My insurance didnt cover the cast. I wasnt Informed that I could pay out of pocket for a 50$ cast. Which is extremely inexpensive which I could have paid for. The Doc was naming off a couple of hand Docs that took Medi-Cal. I assumed my primary would probably point me in those directions. Well she didnt she didnt point me in any direction. So I called the front desk at The Regional Hand Center to see if I could be referred to any hand Docs that take Medi-Cal. The lady with the curly hair at the front desk could not get me any referrals. So I said,"ok thank you" and hung up. At this point my wrist was just hurting so bad because of the splint not being able to keep my wrist in place. So I called another hand Place and the front desk girl referred me to a couple of docs who took Medi-Cal. My complaint is solely about the girl who works at the front desk. I dont know if she didn't know of any referrals or if she was just too lazy to give me any. A week went by and my wrist still didnt have a cast ,my hand was getting swollen and turning blue every single day. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. Which I tried calling The Regional Hand Center again to see if i could pay out of pocket. Called once dialed 2 no answer so I called again and dialed 0 Girl who answered for 0 was very informative and nice told prices of everything. So I told her I wanted to make an appointment. Long story short the lady at the front desk ignored my calls 4 times and right after

I had my boyfriend call for me and she answered he gave her all of my info and she began to tell my boyfriend that they informed me that they didnt take Medi-cal. Which my boyfriend proceeded to tell her that we would pay out of pocket. I couldnt believe the petty childness of a woman that age. She was just extremely unprofessional and unsympathetic. I will never come here again because of that woman at the front desk. I will say the Docs and medical assistants were great and friendly.</review><userid>106775378391187757402< /userid>< name>

<Text>I was about to have them do a procedure on my left elbow when the anesthesiologist they assigned interviewed me and did something very dishonest in informing me of my condition.  He alleged that my cardio function was too poor to try a general .  I checked and found that this was untrue, by my regular cardio.  It actually was very good according to the recent measurements.  When I confronted him with the record that he surely had, he said, "oh, well that doesn't matter," but it did matter because he was making an issue of it in order to persuade me to accept local.  The one thing I will not tolerate is dishonesty from my doctors.  I cancelled the surgery and had it done by another doctor who I could trust.  Nevertheless, they charged me for their consultation.  I was very dissatisfied.<//Text></record>

{'time': 1529626423347, 'text': 'On behalf of all of the staff here at Regional Hand Center, I\'m sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience. We strive to help every person who enters our facility whether they have a scheduled appointment or if we accommodated them into our already full schedule as an emergency patient. Unfortunately the patients who enter our facility with an "accommodating" appointment are being attended to for extreme cases that need to be taken care of ASAP to ensure the best possible results but we do our best to continue to see the patients who had an existing appointment scheduled weeks before. Which means everyone who was scheduled that day for surgery was pushed back to accommodate  STAT patients. Our specialist work until the last patient is taken care of for both the clinic and the surgery center and with our scope of practice our physicians do their best to address the unforeseen circumstances. I apologize again for the wait time and loss of work, it’s really difficult to gear how long appointments will take because ever case we take care of is different and unique. Feel free to contact me if you like to discuss this further, 559-322-6600.\nSincerely,\nBianca\nBusiness Development\nRegional Hand Center'}<//resp>

<Gmap_id>0x80945d2813fa8b09:0xf9ce0defb8fc7ab7<//Gmap_id><review>My family has never dealt with a more unprofessional medical organization. Not only did the surgeon need to preform a second surgery on my son's hand because of something that was missed during the initial procedure, but the office staff was repeatedly rude and disorganized, losing our insurance information, forgetting about scheduled appointments and therefore attempting to reschedule, and not keeping records of the prescriptions prescribed. There is a severe lack of communication between the surgery center and the office center and staff. In addition to all of the negative experiences already mentioned, my son also left surgery with an additional abrasion, which was the result of the bandaging on his hand being wrapped too tightly. I would never recommend this facility to anyone.</review>< Response>

<review>Good doctor makes the difference !
I was the first time patient and I mailed in my registration paper work,  in order to save time when I got there.   The front desk staff told me:" You should bring it in with you,  not to mail it."   No body had told me over the phone that I was not supposed to mail it,  but to bring it.  However,  I didn't want to argue with her at that moment.  What will it make a difference if I mail it in, or bring it in anyway?  I think that they just don't want to open the mails and file them in time.  After I insisted that I didn't want to fill out the paperwork for the second time,  they finally went to check the mail and open the envelope for the first time.
After a short wait, I was called in for X-ray.   The staff was friendly and helpful.  Then I was put back to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and consulted my extraction request.   He examined me and found out that my referral from my general dentist,  had made a big mistake about my tooth extraction!  Can you imagine that if they pulled out three of your good teeth by mistake?!
This doctor listened to me and examined my teeth and checked the X-ray,  then he decided to pull out the right tooth,  instead of the wrong tooth!
The doctor was very nice, soft spoken,  encouraging and professional. The whole supposed -to -be painful extraction only lasted about 20 minutes.
Even though I went through a few terrible experiences with the previous dentist and oral surgeon's offices, my hard work and painful waiting time was finally over!
Thanks for this doctor and he really made a huge difference!<//review>< Resp>

The fear of pain and recovery is what made me always postpone the procedure, in a way I am glad I did because I was referred to Abari Orthodontics & Oral Surgery. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, they made me feel at ease through the whole process! I would definitely recommend Abari Orthodontics!</review>< Response>

I took my son for a consult for tongue tie we were referred by his dentist and honestly didn't have the greatest experience. Before his appt I recieved several phone calls in regards to insurance and general information we get to the appointment we had the consult with the doctor and then we were told procedure was not covered by our dental insurance and it would be this much I was like ok. I had called our insurance previously before going to the appointment and was told it would be covered at 90% the procedure. So when we were walking out I told them that to my understanding it was covered and they told me they were trying to get a hold of the insurance if I wanted to wait and then was told there system was down. I don't understand why they couldn't just call my dental insurance. They told me they would call me back which they did and again not covered and was given a code to confirm that they were saying the truth. I called my dental insurance for the 3rd time and gave them the code and was told it was the wrong code that the code I was given had been replaced by a new code and again I was told it would be covered at 90%. We could've paid out of pocket but why have to pay when something is covered. We had consult at two other locations and at both we were told we were covered. I felt like I was being scammed! I know everyone's experiences are diffrent but seriously after I left I didn't feel happy with the visit or the way things were being said.< /text>

< review>
It was absolutely terrible. Okay so I do not have any major bite or jaw issues but my teeth were just a bit overcrowded so I came here. I came here for about two years and absolutely nothing happened. Like there was little to no effect. My family and I then moved to Florida, as it would be a more convenient place for us (job, money, opportunities, etc.). Of course, we needed to find a new orthodontist and we found one. So far, (it's been 5 months) my teeth have looked so so much better in this honestly pretty short amount of time. Also I found out from my new dentist and orthodontist that the way the were putting the braces on my teeth was pretty bad for my jaw, and they didn't see how any of this could be beneficial for me. Anyway I'm glad i'm out of here  :) seriously though, this orthodontic place might be good for some crowding or minor teeth problems, but it isn't good for people (very painful too, i know braces are painful anyway but going to this place just amplified it) who actually have some problems with their bite. for your own well being do not come here unless you have minor (minor= overcrowding, slight overbite, maybe a tooth that's way too upwards but not anything else) problems that you want to fix.</review>

Was a little scared to get all 4 wisdom teeth out cause of all the stories I’ve heard from my family members but Abari was great they put me under anesthesia and it honestly felt like I just closed my eyes 😆 my family was surprised my face didn’t get swollen either only used pain medication for 2 days after surgery and I was already eating pizza even though I shouldn’t be lol. Great Surgeon I highly recommend you come here for dental 👌🏽<//review>

Dr. Abari’s office was amazing. I had to remove my wisdoms and it only took 15-20 minutes for the removal. The anesthesiologist did an amazing good inserting the ivy and the oral surgeon worked so fast. I was so surprised at how quick they were able to get the procedure done. I’d highly recommend coming here.<//Text>

Im currently in treatment at Abari Orthodontics Oral Surgery and let me tell you im extremely happy with results. I have my confidence back in as little as 3 month i started noticing a huge change, teeth straighter but also started smiling with friends and family I started smiling in pictures!!! Best thing I could have done and Dr. Abari and his team are very knowledgeable when it comes to the latest technology and findings in the dental world they would treat every single issue not just a crooked tooth they went beyond and fixed every single little detail. I definitely recommend this office for anyone who wants the best treatment they can find!!!</review>

Im currently in treatment at Abari Orthodontics Oral Surgery and let me tell you im extremely happy with results. I have my confidence back in as little as 3 month i started noticing a huge change, teeth straighter but also started smiling with friends and family I started smiling in pictures!!! Best thing I could have done and Dr. Abari and his team are very knowledgeable when it comes to the latest technology and findings in the dental world they would treat every single issue not just a crooked tooth they went beyond and fixed every single little detail. I definitely recommend this office for anyone who wants the best treatment they can find!!!< /Review>

I just finished treatment here and I am beyond satisfied! Everyone was very kind and the work was done so efficiently I was even able to finish a bit earlier than what was planned. I could not possibly ask for anything else from an orthodontist, and I am extremely grateful for their amazing team.<//review>

The results, this office, the staff, everything has been just incredible. I really love my new smile and how everything has turned out. Everything about this place has been an amazing experience. The waiting room has entertainment: TV, Internet - which is definitely a great first first impression. Also, all of the staff are super friendly, and Dr. Abari and Dr. Will are great doctors. I really love how skilled all the staff are and how much they actually care about the patients. The Abari bucks are a great motivation and system, too.

I will definitely recommend Abari Orthodontics to all my friends and family. Overall, everything has been wonderful, and I will definitely tell everyone to come here!<//Text>

This was the first time I have every had braces on my teeth and he made the whole experience comfortable and painfree. I was also impressed with the way his staff went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and relaxed.   Whenever i had a question or needed an adjustment to my braces they would take the time usually the same day to address the issue.

I have a great smile and I owe it to Dr. Abari and his staff. I would recommend Dr Abari and their staff for any orthodontic work or procedures< /Text>

<Text>I never thought that my teeth would be as straights as they are now.  I thought the process would be tougher than it really was. This office was super clean and the dr told me exactly what I had to do to get my braces off in the time that he suggested. All the assistants were very motivating and encouraging everytime I went it.  The office is easy to find and well worth the 16 months that I had braces on.

This place is so horrible. The girls in the front are super nice...but we were having an issue with my daughter's gums and the head orthodontic started to speak to me as if I were a child. Very unprofessional!!! Im not a child and learn how to speak to people, not very likely ill be back here.</text>

Worst orthodintist I've been to. The orthodontists from abari orthodontists seem to want to attend the young girls over older patients. Even when I arrive several minutes before my scheduled appointment, they would call the young girl patients who arrived later than me, before me. I had to go to the counter to remind them that I have been waiting for a very long time. They would call me like 30 minutes after my schedule time. Another thing I dislike about this place is because some of the orthodontists are rude. And if that wasn't enough, the main orthodontist (Abari) would grind my teeth thay are still crooked, to blend it to the rest, instead of wait for the braces to straighten them. Also, besides their braces being the most expensive compared to the rest, they give you a cheap retainer that never even fits properly. After I had my treatment, their cheap worthless retainer did nothing to retain my teeth straight, and my teeth are crooked again!<//text>

<Review>Not a luxury hotel! Out dated. So if you're looking for some fancy this is not the place.
However, staff are wonderful! Beach access is superb! Lots of space! We saw deer every day during our 1 week stay. Restaurants and stores 2 minutes away. Quiet and peaceful .< /Review>< Pictures>

<Date>1618790400000<//Date><Review>It was a relaxing over night stay after a busy beach train ride in Santa Cruz. There were a lot of people in the beach so we cancelled our plan to stroll around after the train ride. I was thankful I chose to book this room since the resort and the beach was quiet and private so we can socially distance ourselves. Most of the people in boardwalk and the beach are wearing masks so we felt very safe.  Our room was a walking distance to the beach and has a balcony.  No amenities like coffee maker, microwave and TV so we're glad they have free wifi and hot water. It was perfect for a quiet weekend to unwind and recharge.</Review><Response>None</Response>< rate>

My room was awful. It was adjacent to a boiler room and the boiler dripped all night. The drapes were covered in dust, the wall paint was dingy and marred, and 4' florescent tube stye lighting was installed above one of the beds. Garage style lighting is always great for ambiance. I won't go back.</text>

<review>Really loving this place. It is very open and low in guests. It is spring and we got a special deal. One trip was a discount rate, another visit we got third night free. It is so cool here. We may be the only ppl in our whole building. The one thing is the rooms we saw were a bit "worn down." They could use new paint and carpet.</review>< pics>

There was an actual smudge of feces on our toilet seat, indicating that our bathroom had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. When notified, the folks at the front desk did not seem overly concerned about the issue and I had to request some Lysol wipes and gloves to go clean it myself. In addition, very serious deep cleaning issues, gray patches of grimy handprints on the back of the bathroom door indicated that slacking on cleaning has been going on for quite a while. Especially grieving at a time when most hotels are working very hard to make sure guests feel comfortable and safe in particular about the cleanliness of frequently used surfaces.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Amazing fire place set up. Rooms are dated but functional and clean. The grounds are gorgeous and spacious.
We had a wonderful time and definitely plan on coming back.
Many social distancing measured in place, and a lot of space to keep distance. Staff was lovely. Thank you so much.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO97YbavresO3L9zxbFqDpFDgv-De1uzMMJXXIn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJYiw8UNh_RgbkRNuSqpSU1B5DmhZOC-fQAFXV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVY21TH4D8s28YeoSBjhqEzlLIMAwYRUzd5IGz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx4_SaHACl981cyWvqmp2dGUZH4ALnujalR1Iv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519< /gmapID></record>

While the setting is beautiful there is no sound proofing between the rooms and you can hear everything in the room next to you. When we were there we could could hear the squilling, screaming, and jumping of children to distraction. Parents don't seem to have any control of their children..it was crazy making! I thought Asilomar was supposed to be a place of peace and quiet, it was not. Very disappointing!!!</Review>

The rooms have a summer camp feel, older and basic amenities, but the real draw is the property. Absolutely stunning, a lot of wildlife, easy access to Asilomar Beach and the sound of the ocean close by permeate the night.</review>

<Text>Beautiful location but dated facilities. Insulation is poor (thermal and noise) and bathrooms are cramped, dark, and overall not attractive. Plenty of hot water. Had a faulty thermostat that needed to be set at 50 to maintain a temperature of 70.</Text>< pics>

Fantastic beachfront location. However, no TV, no phone, fridge on request, no coffee maker or microwave. Very old building. Heater controls making tons of noise. Very lumpy pillows. Old, but clean linens. There was a leak in the ceiling drywall in the bathroom that got progressively worse, pouring water into our bathtub every time the person above used the shower.The location is unbeatable, but for the price, at least fix up the place a little to basic hotel standards in the 21st century.< /Review>

<Review>It was truly awful. The building they placed us to smelled horribly inside. The room is tiny and nothing like in the pictures. After you run water in the sink for 15 secs it fills up and you have to wait 15-30 mins to use it again. We tried not to touch anything and didn’t even shower that’s how disgusting it was. There are better hotels in the area for half the price. We were too tired from a long drive and got there late so we had no energy to book and move to another place. Don’t struggle , pick another place</Review><gmapID>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519<//gmapID>< Pictures>

I love going to Asilomar. I think of it as "hotel camping;" lots of nature but no TV and the amenities are not the point. The wi-fi doesn't accommodate the kids' online games and cell phone and hot-spot reception doesn't really allow you to work efficiently from the rooms. The rooms are usually clean enough but nothing fancy. The beds are not too hard, not too soft, old, but completely fine. Healthy walk to the beach and the possibility of coyotes or wild cats hangs in the air. You will definitely come into close contact with deer. A great respite.</Text>

<Text>Slightly dated room, at least at the Manzanita, and for the price (150 a night) but overall great stay, and beautiful grounds. My only complaint was our room had a slight odor. Very close to Asilomar beach, as well as 17-mile drive.<//Text>< Pictures>

Great place to unplug from digital and tv. It was nice not having a tv and we were able to enjoy the sounds of nature smell of pine trees it was like camping in a hotel. Yes the place is seasoned but that’s okay we knew that before we went. The walk to the beach is great with a  nice boardwalk path.< /Text>

I stayed here in 2017 with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised with how great the rooms and area were up kept. I would definitely stay here again and with the cost of the rooms it was unbeatable compared to the big name hotels around the area. Highly recommend if you are on a budget and want to try out a new hotel experience!</text>

Great location, just not the “resort” you might expect for its location. Rooms need a major update, along with the plumbing. Bathroom fixtures need to be replaced I could have pulled the shower head out the wall! Also our bathroom had a ton of ants so there’s that. Customer service was great though, very attentive, and being very close to the beach morning walks are a treat. I don’t know if I would stay here again though.<//text>

The room I got was wonderful for the price. It had that camping ground kinda feel, with plenty of trees and local fauna. The staff was really helpful and courteous. It's right next to the beach! The drive down to Cannery Row wasn't far either. Definitely recommend.< /text>

Hotel was very clean, even the carpet!! 😆 I loved that the ocean was within walking distance from this hotel, the sunset was an absolute dream to witness, I loved every second of it! Customer service was friendly and welcoming. The beds could have been more comfortable, but given everything else was so great, I couldn't complain. I will definitely come back to this hotel when I visit Monterey in the future. The location and the quality for the price is unbeatable.<//Text>

Pros: Great location! We saw deer and coyotes from our window. Honestly, one of the cheaper options for the weekend (Valentine's Day weekend). Unfortunately, the wifi is a bit spotty, the room is very outdated, and there wasn't hot water.<//text>

< Review>
A fabulous place to go, by the 17 mile drive in Monterey, right on the beach. It can be chilly, so be sure to bring warm clothes. A gorgeous lobby that was designed by Julia Morgan (William Randolph Hearst’s architect) resembles a treehouse with a HUGE stone fireplace. They keep the fire roaring with enormous logs. A fun place to play pool and go for walks along the beach. The Hearst family used to own it. Well worth checking it out!</Review>

I do enjoy the conference grounds and the gently rustic accommodations, and the conference facilities.

Having visited for many years, what caused me not to go 5 star is the significant jump in room rates under the new concessionaire and the decline in food options at Crocker Hall. While the food quality is very good, and much is locally sourced, having only 2 choices for dinner or breakfast is an issue.

Would I recommend staying? Yes. The proximity to Spanish Beach and 17 Mile drive and the overall ambiance make it worthwhile.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2zATvyKAYapXTAh8gCl87aZuqbQ3YxmzAYYWq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< rating>

Our room was very very dirty, cobwebs, spiders, rug and shower floor. The sheets on one of the beds had some type of droppings on the pillow case and sheets. They gave us a new room and the cold water shower knob didn’t work. The rooms haven’t been remodeled since the 70’s. Rooms need remodeling, housekeeping retrained<//text>

5 star location and architecture; accommodations a little worn with bathrooms that could be updated. Fantastic place for group meetings: lots of communal space and plenty of nooks for small break out conversations. Very peaceful and restful atmosphere. Would visit again.</review>

<review>Found heaven on earth here, literally by accident while surfing and looking for a restroom.  Stay here! Rustic, natural,  peaceful,  restoration right at the beach and easy walk to the paradise that is Pacific Grove.  I would live here! Rooms in history,  The Lodge is amazing. Arts & Crafts nostalgic excellence. Great dining,  buy the breakfast, worth every penny. The coastal walk every morning& you're a new person.<//review>< pictures>

<review>This is a beautiful conference grounds in facility situated on the ocean near a public beach that has tide pools and an area where Surfers can surf. The buildings were designed by famous architect Julia Morgan and some have a rustic feel to them. Most of the rooms do not have TVs or other amenities that you would find in a typical Hotel. You can stay here and dine in the dining hall for what is kind of an expensive fee but it's worth it since you don't have to go anywhere to get food so it's very relaxing. There is a main Lodge that has a lot of activities such as ping pong pool table and add a fireplace with chairs where you can sit and read and also a cafe and Bar. Some of the rooms have special meeting areas so if you have a family gathering and you booked a bunch of rooms together you can get also a conference room this like a giant living room where you can hang out together. The weather here isn't really like Sunny Beach weather but it's warm enough and it have a swimming pool that you can use but it's often very cold.</review>< Rate>

Really great low cost place to stay ocean side. Rooms are a little funky but you come here not for a luxurious room but rather a beautiful scenery and the historic character and charm. We look forward to returning for a longer stay.</review>

This is a wonderful place to stay and a great place to have a work conference. The ease of access to the beach nearby makes for a delightful trip and offers some amazing views at sunset. The food here is ok but the facilities in the hotel rooms are pretty good.<//Review>

Asilomar conference center and hotel is a historic location. It is a fascinating place to hold a conference. The grounds are exquisite!  I can hear the roar of the ocean I'm at least a quarter mile away. It is now the middle of January there was a storm last night the surf is absolutely amazing and its height and turbulence.the outbuildings of which there are a number of conference meeting styled venues and various housing options have been built across different time frames from the original buildings. This is not a normal hotel. If you're looking for one of those you may want to continue  your search. Not only is this a beautiful venue but it's a place of ideas and exploration across the number of different groups who hold conferences and meetings here. My room is large and situated in the beautiful coastal area of Pacific Grove. I would heartly recommend the venue especially if you will be participating in one of the conference or meetings. You may also come and just rent a room. But don't expect a TV. There's too much life and beauty around to engage with that. I give this venue a five star rating because of its overall connection to so much beyond just a place to spend the night.< /review>

A little hard to drive roads at night and some roads closed / one way due covid19. Roads are clean, no TV and intermittent wifi at night. Covid19 people available in check-in at 2pm to 10pm else call their number.< /Review>

This hotel is in absolutely beautiful place to visit. It has lovely rooms and a fantastic "social lodge". Each building also has a small lounge area. However, be aware of the room you book. Historic rooms are precisely that: historic. They are a bit beat up because they have been around for many years and are a bit small. That being said, the area is beautiful and the beach access cannot be beaten. The beach is approximately seven minutes down the main path and is positively beautiful.</Text>

Rustic, old-style Lodge on state park grounds.  The rooms were 2-star quality, but were clean. In 3 days, they never changed towels (even when we tried leaving them on the floor). I would not recommend this place unless someone was looking to really commune with nature. There was not much else to do.  I liked the nearby beach.< /Review>

Typical outdated and few amenities government property in both management, staff and conditions of the room.  Looks like they haven't updated the rooms in 40 or more years.  The sinks and bathrooms have rusty and dirty fixtures.  The room sizes are small and furniture minimal.  Cost was twice the cost of staying in a nearby motel/hotel so won't make this mistake again.  The reputation far outshines the actual experience.<//Review>

<user_name>Expedia reviewer<//user_name><UserId.>None</UserId.><rating>None</rating><date>1599868800000<//date><text>The only good thing about this hotel is its proximity to the beach. The hotel itself is extremely rundown. I had to change the room bc my bed didn’t even have headboard, the balcony door didn’t open and there were ants in the bathroom. Second room wasn’t much better but at least the bathtub didn’t have mold growing in it. Balcony door opened but wouldn’t close; there was no working A/C, stained carpets and very uncomfortable beds. Honestly, this was the worst hotel experience in my life. I considered checking out right away but because it was Labor Day weekend, most other hotels in the area were sold out. I strongly recommend spending a bit more and staying at a cleaner hotel<//text>< Gmap_id>

Rooms vary from old to more modern and from small to decent size. Main problem is food access. Dining hall is prohibitively expensive as is the cafe. You aren't allowed to bring outside food into the main areas, so leaving Asilomar to eat is the only other option. Access to the sand dunes pathways and the beach is convenient and the beach has gorgeous sunsets.<//review>< userid>

<Text>This is one of the best places to stay in Monterey. A Charming walkway directly to the ocean, a fire pit by the ocean for wine socials and entertainment on the weekend. Not particularly cheap except during the weekdays, it still offers Charming touches like individual rooms in the forest area, where deer can be seen directly from your patio window! There is a Starbucks concession in the main building where you check in and that particularly added points to how I view Asilomar. The only drawback I can see are that the rooms don't contain TVs or refrigerators. Rooms do have Wi-Fi which is a plus. They offer breakfast, but at $20 a plate oh, it seems a little much so we passed on that. One thing you should do is bring an ice chest with plenty of what you want to snack on. There is a Safeway in Pacific Grove that you can stock up on what you want to put in that ice chest and it is on the main drag of Pacific Grove, short distance away. Safeway also has a Starbucks by the way so one is always close by. We have been there several times and never been disappointed. You just go just where the white sand is, stretch out and enjoy a wonderful Seabreeze. I don't think it gets much better than that!</Text>< Resp>

Also, an historic local property originally designed by Julia Morgan for the Heart family.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlCBTY28_vBIv3UEt7-UqrXxmi8FT5Np6KIlvz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH7VklOsDCHCkpXxtMqB_UyhPSLbk0j7MuWutO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNblb1BJ-UaYwaHzm_nG9fv5AaZ6QlNt3ovd7oP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn4DgYshdxegPnISW-RZhzDaQo_whWjNGI6Bgf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLJVjkaCNRCmCk9I-jImog0-KisBHKcEzFsRyi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS-LfIhFUYcEKx0dWuMkNcqM0bsvij9XMIHZLy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8e7BSu_PXZKv8wUnjI_Ht5bEqbFr6XbiwqjTk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAmSV2NQiHCs-MLNFsisZMlz6XKqyTkHLiE88j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZeqcvEuvBmDX241enHuWuGwxcD27TXBZh2R2c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

This place is a gem. It’s not ritzy and it’s a bit dated, but thats really not the point. The grounds are sprawling and beautiful - pine trees and deers grazing from time to time,the place has the national park lodge nostalgia vibe, and just across the street from lovely asilomar beach. Rooms are cozy, especially those with fireplaces, and views are really nice. Kids have plenty of places to roam around. Pre covid loved the cafe with wine and beer and deck chairs.</text>

<Review>This is the beat place ever for a conference or just to walk around.  The geounds are beautiful and you can hear the ocean from large parts of the grounds.  Do yourself a favor and go to the beach right behind the conference.  There are boardwalks to guide you tonthe beach.  The grounds are hilly and the buildings are a bit difficult to find but there are maps everywhere to help you.  It ia by the ocean, like right there, so it will be overcast in the morning and rains frequently.  The food ia okay but I didn't care and drove a few minutes to get amazing food.  Oh there is very little parking on the grounds, so plan on parking offsite and walking or get there early and wall.around the grounds</Review>< Pics>

Beautiful conference setting with plenty of walking options down along the beach. Hotel rooms are basic and a bit dated, but functional. Signage and layout is very confusing so make sure to take the grounds map at check-in or take a picture.< /review>

Rustic beauty nestled close to many convenient locations.

My wife and I enjoyed spending several nights in the Willow Inn cabin. While the wifi was a bit spotty, we didn't spend enough time indoors for it to matter as much. I would definitely have rated Asilomar five stars if the wifi was more reliable. 😁

The views were magnificent and the on-site Cafe was nice. During the day it was a full service coffee shop, at night it doubled as a bar!

We will definitely be coming back again!<//Review>

Gorgeous, natural location. Friendly, quick check in. Spacious conference facilities and grounds. Rooms were "rustic" at best. Mine was ok, but several in our group had issues with either excessive or non-existent heating. And I'm not talking the type of folks who complain about a one or two degree difference. These are outdoor, hardy types. I mean some rooms at 85+ and others were 50 degrees (outside temp).</review>

Highly recommended.  This is a great secluded place to host a convention. A gorgeous location right next to the beach. Fantastic to see wild deer wandering about. The only fault with this conference center is that, due to the age of the buildings, they may not have all the modern amenities.  But, it's been quite awhile since I stayed there and maybe they've upgraded.  At any rate, it's a great place to host a convention (or just rent a cabin) and make wonderful memories.  😁</review>

<Text>Rustic = old and in dire need of renovation. Basic necessities are not available in room (no tv, no fridge, no phone, no hot water kettle or coffee maker, no proper cup - only thin plastic cups). Facilities are very outdated - some window grilles are bent, bathroom hardware are rusty, water go down drain very slowly. On top of that, we can hear people walking up and down the upstairs room very clearly, keeping us up all night.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Located in a beautiful spot, right next to the beach. Customer service was good, the room was good. The only dowfall was that the place is a little run down, and some things where clearly falling apart.the landscaping was not ideal, and with some extra work to the landscaping it would look very nice. A lot of the buildings where a Little run down and so was the carpets. I have to say though, the pool was well taken care of, and the water was perfect. Besides that, it was great.<//Review><time>1568229239364<//time><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519< /Gmap_id>< userid>

Absolutely stunning. Annoying that café at hotel that prides itself on being environmentally sustainable has only disposable cutlery and plates and cups. Not OK.<//text>

I wouldn't ever go back to this retreat center, even though it's location is awesome. Being kept standing in the cold and rain over 30 minutes before meals, waiting to be allowed into the dining area.  Vegetarian food poor and portions tiny compared to meat eaters.  Military style treatment in the dining room.  No response to feedback. Employees expressed their despair about the treatment in this place to us.</text>

Stumbled onto this spot on accident and it was worth the check! Beautiful hotel and conference location that's past some small sand banks. Has a slight Carmel feel to it with the wood design and sea trees all around. Would definitely make a longer stay here if i can.</Text>

Beautiful location, the room I stayed in had a wonderful view and a balcony. Easy access to the ocean on foot. My only complaint would be lack of amenities--no in room hot water kettle or coffee maker, no microwave or refrigerator.< /Review>

The walls are so thin that you basically are involved in everyone's conversation. I found myself whispering being concerned on who could be listening. The room was freezing no matter how high I increased the temperature. The bed was not comfortable at all. The saving grace is the views but anywhere in monetary bay is a great view.< /text>

<text>Location: Great!
Rooms: Older, but clean lodge-style (more summer camp than luxury hotel), beds are very firm
Common areas: very nice - great for groups to meet up
Grounds: Mixed bag of nature and parking lots
WiFi: basically useless
Overall: better than the sum of it's parts< /text>< pics>

A beautiful tranquil place to relax and take in all the sights and sounds of the beach. My family and I always enjoy our stay here. When we want to go to the beach there is a short trail that winds along a boardwalk straight to the beautiful beach. The rooms were clean and the grounds were quiet and peaceful except for the occasional deer or raccoon passing by!<//review>

The lodgings, while historic, felt a bit run-down to me. As long as you go in with the knowledge that “historic” can mean “rustic,” you’re probably going to enjoy your stay a lot. #Glamping
That said, the location is unparalleled! Gorgeous beach just a short walk away, right before the famous 17 Mile Drive. A glorious spot to see the sunset for visitors and locals alike.< /review>

This place is really nice.  The amenities are OK. Don't expect complimentary anything but there is a beautiful beach I half a mile away. Parking can get crowded but in the evening you should be able to find a spot.

Regardless, it's a nice clean facility with the rooms dating and designed back in the seventies. It's a nice clean facility with the rooms dating and designed back in the seventies .   I am only commenting on my room or the block of rooms in my building. I don't know how the entire facility looks.   That being said, I have no problem with the old school seventies look. It's good quality and definitely not IKEA cheap.< /Text>

Rustic, comfortable, cozy, gorgeous.  Pacific Grove and Asilomar State Beach do not lack for spectacular views and scenery.  The conference grounds themselves seem to host all sizes of groups.  The rooms I've stayed in are outdated but always clean.   The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  This is more of a place for a scenic quiet retreat than it is a raucous posh nightlife filled extravaganza.  Great place to escape to some of the most beautiful scenery and nature this Earth has to offer.< /Text>

Location was nice. The room was outdated and didn't want to put anything on the floor. For the price you would think they could afford to renovate. It sounded like water was running continuously. Food was good but I left still hungry. I paid $300 for one night and $40 for one plate. I will stay somewhere else next time.< /text>

This is a great place for a retreat to relax away from the busy life of the city. It is elegant in being down to earth and natural. You will see an antelope or two outside your hotel room! There is a great ocean view a few hundred metres off. They serve great dishes as well and the staff were pleasant. On the down side....the rooms may need some improvement to spice up the place.<//text>

Amazing space for tranquility combined with opportunity to walk on dunes/beach. Near town but feels far from everyday stresses of the world.The historic buildings echo a time past. Lodge offers space to mingle with others but seclusion and nature only a few steps away. Staff friendly, helpful, and seemed to enjoy their work. Room rates reasonable.I’ll be backDownside was high cost of meals.<//Text>

Hidden fees! Was not warned that there is a resort fee. Also if it's your first time here and if you don't know any better there are no TVs refrigerators or telephones in the rooms. They need to have that posted!</review>

< Review>
I  stayed here for 2 weeks while working at the U.S. Open. I loved everything about this place. The open nature, the tranquility of the scene. All was well, until my last day there. I came in after a 12 shift & discovered some of my belongings were missing. When I checked out the same day, I mentioned it the receptionist & she really didn't care... I come to the conclusion that housekeeping stole my 1/8 of medicine & a few articles of clothing since no one else had access to my room.< /Review>

<Rating>None< /Rating><text>The room was clean and the beds were comfortable . However, the accommodation overall was disappointing. The block we were put into was quite far away from the resort centre overlooking a builders merchants with the grounds, car park and accommodation block open to the public. We felt insecure whilst we were there. This was exacerbated by the fact the safe in the room did not work and despite promises by the management was not fixed for us. No phone or tea making facility.The accommodation is clean and comfortable but basic and very much in in need of modernisation.</text>< Pics>

This is where the wind and the sea  meet.

Admittedly the place has been built up and densified more, losing some if it's charm. But it is still a great place to hold a meeting with access to the beach.

And the cafeteria isn't bad for healthy but expensive choices.< /text>

We loved staying here. The historical context and geographical position were amazing: brilliant walks around the centre and along the coast. Even had a glimpse of the ocean from our room  - we stayed in Spindrift North which is one of the modern blocks.  You need to like walking as it is a BIG site, sympathetically planted out - we saw a deer with her fauns! However, the whole place is a little tired looking and could do with a refurb.</Text>

Asilomar is a phenomenal place, full of natural beauty.

My room was quite well appointed, and clean with great character as well.

The staff were exceptional and highly professional.

The food was amazing, extremely well presented and outstanding variety and taste.

I usually stay at 4 star hotels and I believe that this resort clearly compares to a 3-4 star rating without question.< /text>

Location is great. The hotel itself was probably really good in the 60s, but by 2019 standards looks more like a camping ground. Spacious and deep (up to 9ft) swimming pool.<//text>

<Text>The "hotel" at Asilomar was great! There were    cabins all through out the paths on this property which were designed beautifully, and trees everywhere to make yoy feel tucked away from everything else. I enjoyed staying in a cozy cabin that made me feel like I was in the woods somewhere up in the moutains. The best part is that we were walking distance (7 minutes) from the beach so you really get the best of both worlds here. The social hall was very spacious and had pool tables, a cafe/bar and tables to play games with friends and strangers alike.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Beautiful location and grounds, with great social hall area.  Rooms are dated but is clean and bed/sheets were comfy.  Water pressure is not great but that's because they throttle the shower heads/faucets with water-saving modifications, which is fine for the environment.  Was here for a meeting and grounds we're functional but conference rooms are inconveniently spread out all over (good for exercise but not for getting between one site and another for concurrent sessions).  Food was fine, but not fabulous--what you might expect for an Aramark operation.  Price of rooms (w meal plan) was a.vit pricey for what you get, but it's you get the convenience of being on campus, rather than slight more unique and better rooming options in the area.  The internet/wifi connection was surprisingly HORRIBLE, often unusable at certain times.  Yes, there are a lot of conference attendees but this is supposed to be a conference center!  Expect to have to rely on tethering to your mobile service to get many things done if you need internet, or plan an internet-free holiday--can't do business or have a meeting that requires access to the internet.<//Text>< Time>

I am stunned to read some of these glowing reviews - these must not be from the "Shores" building where I stayed.  I was so excited about our night at Asilomar in a room with a "fireplace and balcony" in this most beautiful area of California.  The beach and surroundings are undeniably beautiful, but the room was a huge disappointment.  I realize that lodging in this area is expensive, but for the $275 that I spent I felt completely taken advantage of.  There was lots of hair in the room that did not belong to my family (clumps in the drain, on the counter tops, on the bedding).  The floors were very dusty around the edges.  The accommodations are simple and dated (which is fine) but felt dirty and old with a poorly applied coat of paint to cover the last seasons damage.  The fireplace was the best part with a nifty little bag of kindling and logs to burn.  The balcony was a run down ledge on the ground floor with a sliding door that was coming off the track.  I will never go back to Asilomar.  I would rather spend $400 and get a charming and clean room at a bed and breakfast or chain hotel.  I hope that Asilomar will invest in the quality of the accommodations because the history of the property and location can't be beat.  Until then, stay away.< /Text>

< review>
A very nice place,  my good friends had their wedding reception on the property. However, when I arrived by myself and asked for directions to our lodge; I went to the cafe to get a bite to eat. I'm diabetic and it was critical that I eat.  The woman working in cafe, didn't look up to acknowledge my presence, let alone say 'hello" or 'may I help you.' I stood there for several minutes.  I know she saw me because she looked right at me when I was waiting to ask my question at the front desk. As an African American woman, I have been subjected to subtle and overt racism throughout most of my life.  It stings at little more at so-called nice places.  Buyer be aware.  The French bakery on 68 is wonderful and provided excellent service, well worth the ride back up the hill!< /review>

This is my second time at the Asilomar hotel and conference grounds. Two years ago the place was just average. This time it was absolutely terrible. Croton bugs on the pillows, holes in the linen, lipstick marks on the glass.... the whole place is filthy. The nature around is beautiful and giving it a star only for that. The hotel itself doesn't deserve any stars. The food is awfully overpriced and not tasty. You can go into town and get an amazing dinner for half of the price you pay at the hotel. Very disappointed.</Text>

<Review>Nice place outside, however, no insulation in room walls. Could hear other guests talking loudly,  having sex, even their loud snoring.  Everyone seemed to slam their doors.  In fact, the building seemed to vibrate from doors slamming. Plain room. Nothing fancy. Keep your expectations low. Room had a peculiar smell. Toilet area smelled like urine. I highly doubt I'll ever be back at this place. No thanks.</Review>< gmapID>

We just got back from this lovely refuge in Monterey. It's shocking and amusing to read the bad reviews - yes, this is not the Ritz. It's an incredible time piece that is clean, well kept AND environmentally sound. The ground protect the LAST 5% (if it's even still that) of the dunes that have been mercilessly developed. The room as simple and cozy, nice balcony, great staff, great food, great for kids. It was so awesome and simple.< /text>

<Time>1575780165626</Time><rate>4<//rate><Text>There are plenty of challenges to being a teacher. Occasionally you get to spend a weekend at a math conference that happens to be at the beach. Asilomar is hard to rate because it is something if its own species; a resort that is meant as an actual escape, one without televisions in rooms or anything glam, high tech, or fancy. Chic, it most certainly is not, but it's also not the place anyone looking for that would come. The grounds are spread out, which is both a benefit and curse. My FitBit was happy with me, and the 13k steps it took me to walk back and forth to all my conference sessions, but nothing feels cramped, so the layout is actually nice. Though even just getting around among the main social lodge, dining hall, and lodging buildings can become a lot of walking. Somehow it felt as if I were trapped in an MC Escher piece because almost everywhere you go seems to be uphill. I was sure at one point I turned around and should have been going downhill and that was still an incline. Though that aside, being away from town and able to smell the trees and the salty ocean air, to hear the waves crashing throughout the day, the environment is exceptional. It's fairly dark though, and that is also by design. Pathways are lit, safety isn't an issue, per se, but navigating and getting around at night can take a couple days to get your bearings. All told, nice but not amazing. Definitely nothing to discourage me from returning.</Text>< Pictures>

Stayed just one night but was very impressed with the place. extremely well maintained, love the communal aspect - the large dining and meeting halls are great for meeting new people. the walk to the beach is on these tidy wooden walkways (keep the dunes pristine!). The room I stayed in had two queen size beds. The bathroom was clean and there were plenty of towels and included shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Not cheap, but once you're there, relaxation is guaranteed!< /text>

Location and historical interest would make it a 5 , but 2 issues are the basis of my rate:  when I made my reservations for my family’s stay, I requested and was told that the 2 separate rooms I booked were in the same building- that was not the case at check in - our  rooms were in very separate buildings and all rooms were  booked so change was not possible.  The second issue is that the bathroom in 1 of our rooms had a serious plumbing problem when the sewer  line backed up into the shower stall- most unpleasant way to awaken.  The reservation clerk did reverse the charge for that night when we checked out.  While we were waiting for the charge to be reversed, another guest was expressing dissatisfaction with the rooms assigned vs what he was told by reservation service that handles reservations.</Text>

I'm giving this place a 5 star rating for the staff, particularly Shayla B, who was incredibly helpful with paperwork after my stay. Thank you!<//Review>< gmapID>

The area is defent, and the outside-complex is gorgeous, but the actual rooms themselves are about as poor as they come. Both outdated and inhabited by insects such as spiders, the actual corridors is something that I would have expected to be suitable for a hotel.

Overall, I was really disappointed upon seeing the state of my room; on the way to the shower, I had to get through a spider and a cricket that I can only pray left me alone whenever I was sleeping. I came expecting something unique, but you simply can't have a good hotel without a decent room.< /Text>

<Text>The surrounding nature I give 5 stars, even 200 stars. The pool is very good; the staff is very helpful. But to stay in the facility is like camping in cabins, so you should be aware before booking. No fridge; no hot water pot or coffee maker; water in the sink just drips; walls are so thin you can hear someone drop a soap bar in the tub; carpet is grimy; the food at Crocker Hall is like elementary school cafeteria's; and the wifi is extremely slow unless you're in the main hall. I love the history of Asilomar, and having stayed here 30 years ago as a student during a conference, I feel strong affinity for this place. I just hope they invest money in improving the facility.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The rooms we stayed in were far from the advertising pictures on Priceline, where we booked them. No wooden inner walls and antique inner decorations as shown in the ads. Wish the hotel had posted more realistic photos for guest to have a clear idea of what they are getting.< /Review>

Great complex. Very charming but little amenities. No phone or TV in older rooms, which is fine. The walls and ceiling are paper thin, so make sure you bring good earplugs because you can hear the guests upstairs walk, drop things, move furniture, etc.<//review>

< review>
Can't really beat the location. Walk to the state beach from the hotel grounds. Cottages. Our cottage had a common area with fireplace and chairs and tables, and some family board games. No ice machine in the cottage, had to walk to Phoebe's cafe to get ice (3 minute walk, about 300 steps). No microwave or fridge in the rooms, and no TV (which is great). Family atmosphere in the evenings at the main building (where you check-in and where the Phoebe's cafe is), people gathered around the big fireplace playing board games and pool. There is a also an old piano there if you want to play gently. The Crocker dining hall meal prices are absurdly high, though. So if you have a car the town has plenty of dining options. Nearby restaurants are about mike away so you can take a nice walk even if you do not have a car. They also have some bicycles to rent. Overall, great retreat place.<//review>

<Review>This is a great place to stay if you keep a few things in mind.1.This is a conference center and a CA state park. Conditions are more primitive, with dated furnishings and a bit of a walk to your room door.2.Yes, it is more expensive than one would expect, but this is CA -everything is expensive. Realize where you are! This is one of the most beautiful, unspoiled stretches of beach in the world!! The Inn at Spanish Bay is just down the coast, and their starting charge was almost 5 times what I spent for my night here.3. You may be tempted to rush out and do the tourist things -Monterey Bay Aquarium, the art galleries in Carmel, but take the time to enjoy where you are. Walk around the complex and enjoy the unique architecture. Walk on the boardwalk and look at the flowers. Walk on the beach and let the peace fill you soul.</Review>< response>

<text>The grounds are beautiful. Some of the staff was friendly. They get 2 stars.

Our room was 54 degrees despite turning on the heater. The heater never worked. We were brought a space heater (one small one for a huge, freezing family room that accommodates 4 beds). It was a joke. The fuse blew on night one and we froze. Night two....the staff said they fixed it. Fuse blew....froze again. Slept in a huge jacket. Woke up....no phones charged, alarm clock was dead and no alarm went off. Missed family Christmas with my 15 family members (some who I see once a year.) Unfortunately this cold also set off my autoimmune illness so now I am in pain, may miss work, and am out money. This is definitely NOT worth it!!< /text><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Asilomar is a great place to stay and an overall great environment. You will get lots of steps in walking from your room to the main Lodge for coffee or a glass of wine or a game of pool. There are boardwalks all around so you can check out the sand dunes and make your way to the beach. There are many spectacular views of the ocean all over the grounds.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>My cousin was attending an event there and I joined her for lunch... but we just had more of a "picnic" in their room, so I didn't experience much of the facilities. I did wander the grounds a bit and especially the trails through the dunes and down to the beach, which was very peaceful and scenic. Definitely somewhere I'd like to spend more time!< /Text></record>

Heat stuck on 86, no a/c, no television, no refrigerator. Beware not as advertised. The whole place is falling apart. More water coming out of shower threads than shower head, water spray's on mirror. The building department and fire marshal should visit this place. This place would be great to house the abundance of homeless people in California. The state of California needs to get their act together with this property, condition wise and management wise.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Great price for large rooms, friendly atmosphere, Hearst social life is warm and allows for socializing. Service has been good. Lots of things for people to do including ping pong, volleyball, pool 🎱, swimming pool, hikes, bonfires, etc. Had a good time and looking forward to returning. On the poor side, we ran out of hot water, some ants, and not super clean. But the atmosphere of mountains and ocean with preserved landscape makes up for any down points.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519< /gmap_id></record>

Beautiful spot and some great historical buildings designed by Julia Morgan architect of note e.g. Hearst castle.  Meeting rooms are mostly fine with dining hall nice and food was good including vegetarian selections.  Our room was dated at best and pretty threadbare.  Not sure I will be back unless I could get a nice room.  Nice grounds and beautiful spot.< /Text>

< Review>
The web site makes this place look great, but actually it's just OK. You have to decide if the location next to the dunes is worth paying for. From my room, the ocean is hidden by other buildings, and the room is rustic without actually being historic. The charm I hoped for did not materialize. Food is glorified cafeteria food. Service is sometimes pleasant but often brusque.<//Review>

Shut In building. Comfortable basic room with double and single bed. 3 drawer dresser and small desk. Lighting improved from last time I visited but hallway light comes in under door. Roomy bathroom. Plenty of hot water. Building is old and not especially well insulated for sound but other guests were reasonably reapectful. Building is a comfortable walk from dining hall and office. We love proximity to state beach.<//review>

The grounds are beautiful, the staff is friendly but the billing practice is horrible. I checked in as part of a group. All fees prepaid. They asked for a credit card in case I made ancillary purchases.
Why? I gave them my ATM card. They assured me it would not be debited. But it was! I called them twice. Too bad. They deducted $50 from my debit card. Said I need to contact my bank! Hung up on me. Just spent an hour trying to resolve this through the bank. I didn’t authorize this debit and yet I’m out $50. Boo hiss upon the contractor!<//Review>

<text>I love Asilomar Conference Grounds. Anytime friends or family visit if from out of state, we always bring them here. It's a forgot trip back in time and a place to relax and absolutely nature. Asilomar beach, across the street from the Grounds, is my favorite in all of Monterey/Santa Cruz counties. White powder sand, surfers, tide pools, harbor seals, and the occasional sea otter. It can't be beat.</text>< Pics>

Beautiful Julia Morgan architected buildings. Lovely fireplaces. Fun community room.  But Aramark manages this place and (as with their management of other California state owned hotels in parks) Aramark skips ALL maintenance of plumbing fixtures (faucets dripped continuously and couldn't be shut off), painting, cleaning moss off outer walls, carpets were looking threadbare, brunch food was mediocre at best. In short Aramark is milking it for maximum return. Beautiful place being run into the ground by a for profit company.< /Review>

I didn't stay at the Hotel, but I did walk around the property. Julia Morgan's architecture simple yet stunning. The boardwalk to the beach was short but beautiful. Parking was free because Asilomar is a state park. After seeing the inns I'd strongly consider staying overnight.</Text>

Had to change rooms after first night because of pipe knocking sounds all night that kept us awake. Staff was great and set us up with a different room that's much better. Grounds are nice and the beach area is gorgeous. Lots of walking between the buildings. Food choices were limited. Social Hall was great for hanging out and reading near the fire.< /Review>

Great location, yet since the only night I was there, I'm still debating if there is really a difference between a room at this pathetic place and a tent... Without a doubt, any Motel Six looks like a "6 Stars hotel" compared to this horrible place. Dirty room, filthy bathroom, spider webs all over... I have pictures to share... And the best of all... The people at the reception desk couldn't care less about it. One more thing... If you like to watch TV bring your own... Want to call the front desk from your room? Don't bother, they don't care... That's why you won't find a phone in your room.<//Review>

<Date>1537729143112<//Date><rating>4<//rating><Review>This was a pretty good place to stay. The beds were comfy and it was relatively quiet. There are a lot of grounds here to walk around and enjoy. We saw a couple deer on the grounds which was cool. There are some nice Pathways to the beach that are handicap accessible. The pool is heated and There are towels available there for people who wish to use them.  They have a restaurant on the grounds which serves breakfast lunch and dinner. However we felt the prices were too high. we ate at local restaurants in Pacific Grove and found the prices there to be one half to two-thirds of what we found at the resort.  There was some deferred maintenance here but I guess that's to be expected since the property is over 100 years old. when we mentioned these items to the staff they did seem concerned so hopefully they will be addressed. The rooms aren't anything fancy but they were comfortable so we would stay here again.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I like Asilomar and really want to love it. The food is good and the portions are huge (maybe too big). There are some nice amenities and you can't beat the location, or proximity to the beach. The rooms, however are dated and often in disrepair. All of the rooms I've been in have peeling wallpaper, holes in the walls, old furnishings, and sometimes things that don't work properly. If the rooms were fixed/updated, it'd be amazing.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>3<//rate><userid>108847073600479152939</userid>< pictures>

A great place for conferences surrounded by nature. Beautiful campus of separate buildings, all different rooms, wild life freely roaming around. Unfortunately, most of the rooms have quite scarce amount of furniture, which is also quite worn out and deteriorated. Food in the dinning Hall is also of a great quality. However,they seem to have salads for lunch as alternative to the main dish, which more edible.< /Review>

<username>Andrew< /username><response>None< /response><review>The Good: The grounds are absolutely stunning. The beach access is great. The common buildings (like the guest registration and dining halls) are very charming. Catering was mostly okay, nothing special. The bar had a great IPA on tap. The Bad: Most rooms are in desperate need of renovation. Old, smelly, and in my case infested with ants. Some probably view this as a charming form of escape - but the lack of functional outlets was really frustrating when trying to charge batteries or conduct business. In general, the positive memories I'll carry from exploring the grounds will outweigh the shortcomings of the accommodations.< /review>< user>

Heater didn't work. The thermostat was old.
The parking spaces for the Shores building didn't have good access for handicap.
The floor was stained and didn't feel clean.</Review>

We were told we were confirmed for a modern room - HA! Old, furniture dated from 1981 - headboard did not fit the king bed.  Bathroom old, tired, small, chipped porcelain tub with weird marble lip to old tile.  Spiderwebs on door entrances and no elevator.  Had to climb two flights of stairs with no preemptive notice from the front desk. You have to go down the hall to call for housekeeping.  No coffee in room.  Plastic cups for water.  Only amenities for one person. Smelled like mold and mildew, scary to think what the historic rooms look like and we paid senior rate of $256 directly through hotel prior to conference.  Sadly we discovered larger rooms available for $177 senior rate per night -</text>

Rooms are very much in need of a renovation.  The family room has no fridge,  kettle or even overhead light- just dim wall sconces- and I felt like I was visiting my grandparents in the 80s with the bathroom.  The social hall and surroundings are beautiful but it's overpriced for what you get.<//review>

<Review>One of the treasures of the Monterey peninsula, and a place I've enjoyed many times over the years. Extraordinarily beautiful place, right on the beach. Maybe not a place for media addicts--no TVs in the rooms or the property. A place to recharge and listen to the roar of the surf.</Review><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

The hotel was beautiful and historic. Confusing at first but once you get the layout it's great. The food was pretty good and I loved socializing during meal times. I will definitely be going back every year!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><text>Beautiful and Historical. Also rustic and low key. This is not a fancy hotel, however I would choose to stay here. It feels a summer camp for adults. It's a good place if you like to take a walk and sit by a fire in the lodge with a beverage of your choice (yes, beer and wine too.)  Many of the buildings feel like they belong in Yosemite. I asked the people swimming in the pool if they were cold, they said no, the pool is well heated.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>I am traveling this week to stay here for a conference.  I was shocked that I received a phone call a few days back from the hotel more or less forcing me to share my room.  I have never had this happen before.  I was told that if I did not share my room, this girl would not be able to go to the conference.  I thought this was very inappropriate coming from a hotel.  I indicated when I registered that I wanted to have a single room- willing to pay the price for this.  Because I am a pushover (I should have said no but the guilt trip was incredible) now I am sharing a room with someone I barely know.  the explanation is that I will be doing a good deed (?!).  Not a good indication on how this trip will be and the place that I am staying.  I am rather loathing my trip...</Review>< Pictures>

While the location of the resort is wonderful, the antiquated design (our room design appeared to be 1950’s, not chic), small beds, very small bathroom, lack of tv, phone, and not assigned parking spaces really detract from the experience. Additionally, I felt little privacy with the room, which only had one large window facing a walkway, and we also could hear the neighbors all night. I expect more for the amount of money we paid. I would not recommend.</Review>

<Text>Everything was excellent. The grounds are gorgeous and peaceful, if a little bit difficult to navigate due to the winding nature of the pathways between the buildings. However, this is more than made up for by self lighting directories scattered throughout the campus.

The decor is wood and rustic, with fireplaces and hearths, and the food is excellent.< /Text><Date>1480831912279<//Date><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Very friendly staff / customer service and nice location. My family and I felt very safe during our stay and loved how close it was to walk down to the Asilomar Beach. The room we got was small and quaint but clean and affordable. We enjoyed every part of our stay and will definitely be back very soon.<//Text>

This place is amazing and beautiful. Surprised to have a great sunny day in early November but I guess this is California. Lots of rooms and accommodations perfect for gatherings and conferences large or small. The beach was beautiful and clean. Good waves for surfing and samd is clean unlike most beaches near Bay area. Lots of sea/beach creatures to explore for the kids. Food at this area is alright and will do for the amount of people they are able to serve. Will gladly go next time.<//Review>

Beautiful grounds ands location. Very disappointed with the room. Dated, but that was to be expected. However, we were disgusted by dirty boxers/undergarments that were left hanging on curtain rod from previous person who stayed-Gross! Housekeeping must’ve missed them when sliding the curtain. Will not be staying again.< /review>

<review>Asilomar is a gem! A little rustic, but full of charm and true beauty. We loved sitting in the lodge at night, sipping on wine, playing a board game by the fire. Sleeping with the window open to hear the waves crashing all night is a meditative treat! The tide pools at asilomar beach are the best I've experienced. Check the times for low tide and bring your camera!< /review>< Pictures>

Was here for a conference. Pretty quaint. The rooms don't have much going on --- not so much as a TV --- but it shouldn't really matter, because it's best to enjoy the outdoors! Beach is 2-3 minute walk away, and the entire place is kinda in the woods.<//Text>

This is a pretty unique place.  It started out as a YWCA facility in the early 1900s.  This is why it has a Boy/Girl Scout campus compound feel to it.  Many different buildings with fairly basic bedrooms and a shared common gathering place in each building.  There is the main lobby where larger groups can gather and there are conference rooms too for even bigger crowds.  What makes this place a standout, is its general setting and its location.  You feel like you're at a retreat at an exclusive location, which is why it's appealing to stay here.  If you want high end accomodations, this is not the place for you.  It's a historic facility to get away from it all, even though there's world class golfing, Cannery Row in Monterey and downtown Pacific Grove only a few miles away.  Like I said, pretty unique.</Review>

Excellent location in beautiful Pacific Grove. The grounds and trails are fantastic. Close to a beautiful beach. Close to downtown Pacific Grove, Carmel, and 17 Mile Drive. Accommodations are clean and adequate but not luxurious. Ideal for the frugal traveler.< /Review>

The best thing about this conference site is it's setting on a gorgeous stretch of coastline. There's a network of walking trails among the dunes and water's edge which have been rehabilitated with California native plants. The design of the buildings and grounds is very nice, but a bit run down. Almost everything could use some renovations. WiFi is super duper slow. I find that unacceptable these days for a conference venue that caters to many business and industry events. If you really need to get things done online you will get it done quicker and with less frustration if you drive to a nearby coffee shop in Pacific Grove. The food at Asilomar is decent, but way overpriced. You can find many great eateries nearby for far less than you'll spend for an Asilomar meal ticket.</Text>

Great area for dinner and drinks. The beachfront area is unmatched in beauty and there is plenty to see and do around the tide pools. Hotel facilities are a nostalgic memory of the past century. Would highly recommend to all visitors in the area.<//review>

Two stars means "just ok", so here are my thoughts about my stay.

Stayed there 10/1/19 through 10/4/19 in the "Lodge" building, room 208. If you value hearing the ocean and sounds of nature from your room, do not stay in this room! An ancient water heater is located directly beneath the room and the thing goes off roughly every 15 minutes. One of the facility workers told us it is to be replaced, at some point. It was super annoying and I was willing and able to move to another room, but my friend convinced me it was too much trouble and the view of the ocean was more important to her. Luckily I brought ear plugs with me so I didn't have to hear it overnight. And, we were out and about during the day.

I've read other complaints about the appearance of the grounds/landscaping. Really, there is no landscaping. The dirt areas are natural, with fallen trees and dead plants in their various forms of growth and decay. I found the same at Pt. Lobos where many downed trees lay where they've fallen, only cleared from roads and paths. I understand the reason for this, so although it was a tad shocking at first, I got used to it. The area has been suffering with a drought and strong, blustery winter storms (so a park volunteer explained to me).

As for the cafeteria, the meal tickets are expensive, imo, and the the choices limited. The frittata was pretty bad on the one morning we went. I think any meat options are scarce for any variety of reasons.

It is beautiful and historic, so do stay there. Just be aware that some of the buildings are very old and in need of updating. I think there's only so much they can do with redwood paneling that has been abused through the decades.<//Text>

<text>What a surprise this place was! Nestled in the pine trees on the coast it was rustic and beautiful. No television or noise from the city it felt like we were staying in Monterey at a different time. The room was clean. The staff was super nice. It was only a short walk on the path to the beach. I would stay here again!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The setting is gorgeous. The staff members are all kind and helpful. But the conference support is not what you'd expect for the price. For instance, the dinner was pretty basic buffet stuff that I would have expected to come to about $40-$45 a head for a group our size. Instead, it was over $70 a head, plus a big service fee, plus taxes on top of all that. And for a conference you need rooms open for people to hang out, even if it's super late. We couldn't find such a thing.< /Review>

<Text>Instead of a Julia Morgan experience, I got a white-walled, 80's renovated and dilapidated Motel 6 experience (Pirates Den).  Very disappointing.  Room smelled musty and a/c didn't work. Light bulb is LED equivalent to maybe 120W which are way too bright to be practical.

The rest of the architecture is a beautiful arts and craft style. There is an easy and short access to the beach.   Free parking.  Friendly service.  Theres a cool self guided tour, look for markers with cell phone number.  I would go back, but make sure you ask for the more rustic cabins like Scripps.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was told this facility is a state park, run by a for-profit company. We were in a guest building on the property line furthest from the ocean. We were part of a group booking but for some reason we were not housed with the rest of our group. The room was dark and the light fixtures didn't help. No TV in room, adequate WIFI, twin beds and an "earthy" smell in the room. I only saw one outlet available for guest use (without moving furniture) which was on the wall next to the side of a bed; the plug kept falling out of the socket. The wall sconce switch between the beds was loose and looked as if it had been replaced several times with non OEM parts. The furniture looks like it was purchased in the '60's or '70's. Beds were comfortable, linen fresh.

The bathroom is clearly dated. The shower had good water pressure, but the head was low and there was mineral buildup that needed to be cleaned; the bathtub was small. Towels were fresh. Bring your own bottled water as none is provided.The sliding glass door was difficult to open, a fold up security bar, centered horizontally locked the door. The latch on the handle didn't function properly and the guides on the track need adjustment. There is a plastic table and chairs on the balcony. No glassware,  only individually wrapped plastic cups. No in room refrigerator, microwave, coffee or tea service.

Meal service is institutional type cooking, in a main dining hall, set meal times, with vouchers presented at entry. Usually two or three meal choices per meal, large portions with desserts and coffee, tea and water included. Wine is available,  however I believe it's at your expense. You won't go hungry but check ahead if you have diet restrictions like gluten-free, vegan, etc.

I didn have any direct interaction with the staff, however if we passed each other I was warmly greeted.< /review>

Loved my stay there. This was my second visit. This time we stayed in a family style room, with four beds, and a fireplace. Very spacious. It was a handicap accessible room, with large walk-in shower, no tub. We had an infant with us, they provided a porta crib, with sheets, and blankets. They did a great job vacuuming the baby's crumbs. Will definitely be going back.<//Review>

I have stayed at Asilomar several times while growing up, so while planning an adult vacation through California I figured I had to stay there. It was as great as I remembered. The staff are friendly, the rooms are comfortable but still allow you to feel a sort of campish atmosphere. I love being walking distance from the beach and dunes and enjoyed tide pooling. I greatly recommend staying here!< /Text>

The staff was incredibly friendly, and it seemed like there were many amenities for long-term guests. Not necessarily suitable for overnight guests, as we didnt have time to take advantage of these amenities, and the room was pretty basic. (I was hoping for a romantic night by the beach, but beach access was somewhat complicated and the room was not very aesthetically stimulating.) These grounds are probably great for long-term stays and large groups--not the best choice for overnight business or leisure travelers.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Rooms are basic with no fridges, phones, or TV's, but that is kind of the point of the place I guess. Beautiful views of the beach walking distance from the hotel lobby but if you are in the cabins located in the far back it can be a good 10 minute walk which may be a little inconvenient, especially if you accidentally forget your key card in your room. The conference spaces are adequate. The rooms are clean and we'll kept, most buildings have a social area with a fireplace. There are also pool tables in the main lobby. The on site shops are quite pricey for even the most basic supplies, water, snacks, etc.<//Text>< Pics>

Perfect location, walking distance from the beach, 3 min walk to a tasty seafood restaurant Fishwife and clean rooms. However, the water pressure is nil to none, if you have noisy neighbors you can definitely hear them and meals very expensive at the center. If I may make a suggestion to the hotel to group families in one area, adults in another may help with the noise factor.<//text>

If you're looking for a budget friendly stay and don't mind the dorm room accommodations, Asilomar is a nice retreat location. It's a very close walk to the ocean and the surrounding trees and wildlife make it feel as if you're living in the forest.<//Review>

These grounds may have mediocre wifi and limited food, however the connection the hotel rooms have with the pine forests and dunes is beautiful beyond words! This has been the favorite hotel I've ever stayed at, compared to even standard 4-star hotels. The connection to Nature you get from staying in Asilomar is very unique and memorable, the woodpeckers fly around you, the jays and hawks call from the woods, the irises bloom during spring, and the tumble of the ocean waves is so soothing and calm at night. The loss of good wifi is well worth the connections to nature, which our tech-bombarded generations need!<//text>

The location is stunningly beautiful. Easy beach access, walking and biking trails through the dune preservation, and other nearby locations means plenty to see and do. The rooms are very quaint, though a bit dated. My room had a fire place which I made liberal use of.</Text>

Very dated room with No TV or room phone and wifi was weak. The balcony was sketchy and the patio door needs to be oiled because it makes too much noise. The walls are very thin that you can hear your neighbors so clearly. 2 stars for comfy bed and clean sheets.<//Review>

< Review>
My family has had a reunion here every 2 years for about 20 years. The fact that we keep coming back definitely says something. We love the option of getting a meeting room so there is a common place for the 20+ people in our group to gather. The meeting room has a fire place, and the staff will work with you to ensure you have the necessary furniture, and for an additional charge, stock it with hot beverages throughout the day. In the past all guests rooms have been centered around the meeting room, but with recent updates, rooms for larger families are located in a different part of the grounds.

The property is gorgeous and well maintained. It's a short walk to a public beach through protected sand dunes. The lobby has puzzles and boardgames to borrow, and 2 pool tables. The dining hall has always done a good job cooking for large groups of people. Not a 5 star restaurant, but better than most mass produced meals I've had. They are willing to work with dietary restrictions, and have kids meals available if you ask.

The rooms themselves are dated, but I've never gone to Asilomar to spend time in my hotel room. There are no TV's on the property, and cell service / WiFi can be spotty. But the pros far out weigh the cons.< /Review>

Stayed in a queen + 3 twin bed room. Room is clean, and has separate spaces for the toilet, shower, and sink, making it great for larger groups. Staff is very nice. Very scenic. Only downside is that out can be confusing to navigate around to the correct building.</Review>

One of the bad place I ever experienced. There was no internet and every time they said will be fixed in a while. Couldn't fixed in 6 days. The dinner or lunch timings were too narrow.. only one hour if you show up is fine otherwise no other option. Had to go to downtown then in taxi. The staff at reception  were not friendly. I think expensive as well for the facilities they provide</text>

<Review>The grounds are nice and the room is clean but desperately in need of updating. It felt like a cheap motel with old carpeting, fixtures from the 70's, and although freshly painted, the color was about the worst shade of brown you can imagine. If I was naming the color I would call it 'regurgitated lentil soup'. I could see this place easily being a premium resort if they replaced the finishes, fixtures, and furniture. The beach nearby is delightful with very fine white sand and interesting land forms.< /Review><rate>3<//rate>< pics>

This location is great for a retreat or outdoor team building weekend, but it is certainly not a resort. It is part of the state parks system so the rules and policies are a little on the strange side. I will recommend this location if you know what you are getting into to. I was was expecting a resort hotel not this.</review>< rating>

This was a really chill place to stay! The campus is absolutely gorgeous (tons of trees and pathways) and it's right next to the beach. Expect the rooms to be a little old and wooden if you get what I'm saying, it didn't bother me one bit (I thought it was cozy and charming) but my roommate I think had something a little more modern in mind. We got the standard room, not the fireplace or historic room. Lastly, don't forget to order online and scroll down past the normal rate rooms to get to the web-only special rates!< /Text>

<review>Beautiful scenery, small but comfortable beds, great amenities, though not kept to the cleanliness standards of a hotel. Our curtains were stained, for example. That being said, for the price, we enjoyed a great location, with a fun camp-like structure including nightly fire pits and several open lounge areas that encouraged socializing with other guests.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I don't know on what basis 1000 something other reviewers have given this hotel more than 4 star rating.

I stayed here for a conference, for which the hotel charged "special conference" rate of more than $200 per night, just to stick most of the guests up with rundown ill-maintained rooms with sloppy cleaning. My room's hardwood floor was blackened with years of usage and probably has never been polished or cleaned since the hotel was built. The water taps were rusty and leaking (for all the save water, save planet posters everywhere in the room, the least the hotel could do is check the leaky taps)! When I checked in the bathroom in my room had beach sand, which was not cleaned from the previous check-out probably.

The food served for breakfast, lunch, dinner was downright horrible, and often recycled from previous days' leftovers. California is one of the best places in the US to get delicious food from cuisines around the world, but this hotel probably employees caterer who should not be in the catering business ever!

The internet was so awful, it was an ordeal to just check your email. And if you wanted to escape these horrible services, any decent eating place or cafes are more than a mile walk away, so you are stuck here with this horrible service unless you take cab or drive everywhere!

Will not recommend to anyone at any cost!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>Historic place nested in cypress forest just steps from the shore. Wooden buildings blend nicely into surroundings. Grounds are well cared for. Restorant and cafe are available. In the evening -live music events around communal fire. Stuff is great. Although more then century old-fashioned the place is nice and clean and comfortable. The seaside forest setting is the greatest advantage of this place and is well worth the visit. Loved it.</text>< Pics>

Beautiful views, great facilities. Food is also pretty good. At least some of the rooms don't have televisions witch can be a plus or minus depending on the person. I really hoped they would have mini fridges and coffee markers but our room had neither. Beds were not too great and the pillows were horrible, I'm not kidding you might want to bring your own pillow.<//review>

<Text>My daughters and I needed a place to stay overnight when we went to a family wedding. The Asilomar was perfect for us. The grounds were beautiful and I wish we had more time to explore them. The beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was adequate for our needs. The only thing missing for me was a coffee maker in the room. A little amenity that I always appreciate.<//Text>< pictures>

Great campus with beautiful examples of craftsman architecture. Fire places are abundant, and the guest hall includes pool tables and puzzles. Stayed as part of a conference - plenty of large spaces for groups of about 200 to 300, or more. Food was included for our conference and meals were very good, including vegetarian options. We also enjoyed the small bar between meals and relaxing at the many outdoor seating areas. The surrounding grounds are gorgeous, particularly Asilomar State Beach, and only a short walk to a monarch sanctuary as well as the Pebble Beach golf course. Only downside would be the slightly dated fixtures in the rooms, but they could be forgiven for preserving a 1970s/80s classic feel. Otherwise the rooms were generally clean and in good repair.< /text>

Attended a conference there. The conference grounds are large with buildings spread throughout the campus. The buildings are a bit dated and they didn't have air conditioning during a heat wave so everyone was sweating. But the staff were very friendly and helpful and tried their best to open windows and doors and provide refreshments. Overall a very good experience.< /review>

Took us more that one hour to locate the check-in spot and our designated parking lot and our tiny, gloomy, room entrance. You can barely see any noticeable street sign or directory  with in the property. When you gotta on the "Viewpoint" there are more than five alternatives that you can choose from, but you will never end up picking the right route since there are NOOOOOO signs up there!!!! Not even worth the value AT ALL!! We reserved two queens sized beds and they ended up giving a one bed. And, even worse, it's extremely easy to get lost within there since it's all DARK and CONFUSING! COME ON! It doesn't  take you two millions US dollars to hang some proper street signs!! Please! will never recommend it to my friends!!!</review>< Pics>

Just arrived from a 6 hour drive to Asilomar Conference room. Not what I expected.
Got a room with a stinky smell. Dirty carpet, dirty windows, no TV, no fridge, not even an average coffee pot to make coffee. Got a room by Crocker Avenue where the pool is far yo walk to. No sufficient towels. No Breakfast.  Lobby is dirty. Called front desk to let them know that the balcony and curtain door wasn’t working. Said she would send maintenance and hang up without saying bye. Not a happy camper especially for the price we paid for a 1 night stay. Couple pro’s: wi-if, and self guided beach walk.</text>

This may will be one of the most beautiful hotel and conference center in the entire United States!There are vast expanses of restored natural dunes, Monterey Pines and rocky coast shorelines whose character is unique!Come and stay in the apparently rustic extremely luxurious facilities and enjoy the spectacular cuisine in their massive dining room. Your visit here will not soon be forgotten.< /text>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Grounds were in an amazing display of nature. I was there for a staff retreat and our meeting space was rustic and comfortable with a huge fireplace and exposed wooden beams. The food was decent. The chef was able to accommodate our needs from Vegan to Celiac Disease. The rooms were old, but clean. Ours had a fireplace and a bag of wood, private deck, ample storage. The walls are a little thin and there is no tv (forcing you to get out and enjoy nature), but the lodge has pools tables and you are steps from the beach and tide pooling.</Text>< pics>

The bathrooms feel a little old, and the grounds doesn't have food vending machines if you get the late night munchies. Otherwise everything was quite nice. You can even sometimes see deer walking around. Very nature-y.<//review>

<Time>1557540598470< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Don't listen to the sheeple and the idiots - I know you're accustomed to entertaining their foolishness being from California and all, but, in this case, it's time to block all that out. The facts here are simple: Asilomar is pricey even for Monterey, and it is a run-down dump. If you don't care about those two elementary details, you are likely to join the rest of these cretins in blissful and complete satisfaction.

*Edit* I am going to add some specifics:

1) The carpet in our room is ratty.
2) The tile in our bathroom (the bathroom itself is tiny and immensely dated) is cracked. The grout is also enormously discolored.
3) The room is worn - trim is covered in scuff marks, wallpaper is peeling, window lining is cracked, furniture is old.
4) The decking outside the room is incredibly unsound, and appears to be suffering from dry rot.
5) We are located as far from any amenities as-offered by Asilomar as is possible.

Frankly, I couldn't be any more unsatisfied. I've seen Red Roof Inns, Econolodges, and Motel 6s that were far more well-appointed. Asilomar is a scam.</Review>< pics>

Was kind of strange the restaurant was closed at 2 in the afternoon we had to meet in the bar downstairs which was good at first it was nice and quiet able to have a conversation enjoy a couple of drinks and some appetizers. At 4 in the afternoon it became Rock and busy the only had one bartender on serving appetizers and drinks the wait was long for about an hour there was bad service then I staffed up and everything went smooth again it was a hoppin environment, younger crowd [ in their 30s younger compared to me]
The views awesome haven't stayed there yet but I'd like to just to check it out.< /Review>< GmapID>

What a great find and experience.  Located right on the beach with rooms that are laid out well for sleeping.  This is a location and grounds that will have you outdoors morning through evening.  The fire pit at the path to the beach is a perfect gathering place every evening. Totally enjoyed the time here.< /text>

My family stayed there last July, and at that time I had accidentally left my tablet in the room when we checked out. I put a claim in, and they let me know that they found it and I had 85 days to pick it up or have it mailed to my house. I had forgotten about it and my 85 days has passed but I was in Monterey last weekend and took a chance stopped in and they still had it!! So I am very happy with my experience!< /review>

Although it's on the older side, the views of the ocean from some of the rooms are wonderful.  We loved walking around the grounds and taking the trail to the beach. The main building has a couple pool tables, table tennis, and bike rentals.<//review>

The facility was a bit dated but it had an ageless charm to it. My boyfriend and I went for a midnight walk on the boardwalks through the dunes ending in the beach. Listening to the waves crashing ashore was pure magic.< /text>

Awesome venue and lodging! A quaint retreat type place with an amazing location inside asilomar state park!  Come escape the urban jungle! Beautiful architecture designed by the renowned architect, Julia Morgan. Actually the whole site was essentially her doing. Located in a forest yet minutes walk from the beach. And only minutes drive to down town Pacific Grove , Monterey, and pebble beach.
The hotel itself it's like a Travelodge level place with simple rooms, clean but older. Some are historic with classic era furnishings and an available fire place or fireplace in a common lounge. The grounds are well kept and a beautiful place too walk around.<//review>

I stayed here while attending the EcoFarm conference for the last two years, and the location, beauty and amenities at this location can't be beat.

Asilomar is a jewel. Placed alongside  what might be the most perfect beach in Monterey, the grounds are impeccable, the rooms large and the food they serve at the EcoFarm conference is superior organic healthy fare. Staff is wonderful. The gathering hall, with its large and glowing fireplace, is a remarkably warm and inviting spot. Chapel and Merrill Hall are wonderful too. Asilomar is among my favorite spots on the globe.< /Review>

Older property with dated rooms, but it's listed as 2 stars. No bad surprises here. The rooms were large and ours had a fireplace, along with a back patio with table and chairs. Easy walk to the beach, and the social hall is a great place to gather.< /text>

Very old fashioned style rooms. Feels like a time warp. Beautiful scenery from the forest to the beaches. Gorgeous boardwalk and the sunset is to die for. Booked it on Expedia and didn't realize it, but you don't get a breakfast voucher if you don't book through the hotel directly. Otherwise a beautiful place to stay. Got a 2 bed room with the fireplace. Definitely worth it.</review>

This place holds something special for me. Growing up, my father would be attending conferences in the morning while my brother and sister and I would explore the grounds and have fun. It's been 16 years since I've last stayed here, but now I get to share this place with my wife. Basic rooms, no TV or phone, but tons of peace, quite, and fireplaces inviting you to sit next to it and read a book. I can't wait to share this place with my future children.</Review>

< Review>
My wife and I booked a room at Asilomar last weekend. Because we wanted a bed big enough for both of us- the room cost us $241/night. This is an outrageous price considering the outdated condition of the rooms. The room had not been updated since the 1970's. One of the bathroom doors was missing, the outer door was a pocket door that didn't close right and didn't have a lock. The small junky fridge hummed all night next to the bed and the heater was so loud it woke me up every time it kicked on. The rooms do not have a TV, no biggy. But, you would think they would offer some amenities for $241 per night?
If you want breakfast, you are required to buy a meal tix at a cost of $25/person for a cafeteria style meal. They do have a small cafe with over priced coffee. I paid $3.50 for a plain cup of coffee (starbucks is $2.10 for the same size cup) when I went to get a refill I was told it would be another $1 for the refill.

I gave Asilomar 1 star for location. But, be prepared to be disappointed with the quality of the accommodations and the high prices!</Review>

<text>Beautiful setting. Nice relaxing experience (no phones or TVs in rooms), while rooms are a bit outdated. The only negative , as this location is run by Aramark for the state parks, is they may give you greif for eating "outside" food (not purchased from their vendors) in shared/public spaces.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

There was also two billards tables and table games for family and friends. The biggest selling point of this location is the beach that is located walking distance away.< /review>< Pics>

Tranquil.  Beautiful place to stay.  Miles of walking trails.  Easy, gorgeous trek into Monterey by foot.  Rooms have iffy Wi-Fi and no television, but that was a selling point for me.  Staff is lovely.  An ideal retreat.</review>

Place is amazing. Huge open space, multiple meeting and social locations, and many different overnight options from a typical room to a nicely furnished cabin.

Walking distance to the beaxh, but also has plenty of trees and wild life to feel woodsy.</text>

The location is beautiful! Very close to the water and just amazing sights. The buildings are a bit outdated and not exactly what you might expect and to be honest I was pretty disappointed in the food. Still a pretty decent place to hold a conference.<//text>

It's pricey. There's a man who is super nice called Marcel in food service. Other than that, the lady at the reception when we checked in, was totally unable to smile, the landscape needs some love, breakfast at their Café is $20 per person. Great location!<//Text>

After hearing about the distasteful registration and room assignments for a birthday party of three this past week I would never stay at your place. A confirmed reservation is just that, confirmed and requests should be honored. Failure to so says much about your place.<//Text>

Only because I couldn't give zero stars. It's hard to find to begin with. You have to park a 1/4 mile away and walk to check in. Then drive again to your room. Mine was on the second floor with no elevators, so we had to drag our baggage. No tv in room, no phone to call the front desk and no a.c. It was miserable< /Text>

<Review>I love the history, the natural surroundings and the undeveloped beach just across the street. It's a rustic getaway with comfortable beds and friendly service. Our family visits regularly.

There is free wifi, but there are no TVs! Instead, you can spend time together playing board games or pool in the massive lodge in front of the fireplace. There is ping-pong, sand volleyball, bicycle rentals, an unheated swimming pool and (nightly?) campfires to bring your family together.

It's like summer camp, but better!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1487347907282, 'text': 'Thank you Beth!

<text>I was here for a family reunion and decided that one must stay on these famous grounds at least once in a lifetime - and that's the most I would recommend.  We managed to book a room at a last minute 'discounted' rate of $160 plus tax for a total of about $190 and it was obviously mostly for the 'experience' because the room was by far the smallest accommodation we have ever occupied, with the bathroom, closet and bedroom being about 200 square feet, thereby making it unquestionably the highest cost per square foot of any room we have hired.  The double bed, not the most uncomfortable ever but uniquely sloped to push both sleepers uncomfortably together, was squeezed between the wall and the door and there is no way they should have marketed this for two people.  The atmosphere is 'original' (as in 1910 vintage, unmodified except for the bathroom fixtures and energy efficient lamps) and the bare wood walls set the tone everywhere as well as being a major fire trap.  The next day we stayed off campus in a regular hotel room for much less money but much bigger accommodation.  Additional comments from others in our group include 'they make you pay for everything here' and 'they won't let you bring anything to eat in from the outside and you must buy everything on site' although I did find an ice machine which delivered large amounts of ice for free!  In the morning housekeeping started talking loudly outside our door at 8AM and knocked loudly on our door at 8:30.</text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I spent the weekend here as part of a retreat. The location can not be beat. Grounds feel like a National Park lodge - basic but accommodating (no TV, one pillow, not so comfortable beds). I shared a room with a three other women and we were each able to have our own bed - definitely a plus! The room also had a fireplace with all the wood and kindling ready to light - also very enjoyable!

The main lodge had a roaring fire going at night and lots of chairs for casual conversations.

The food was good for a cafeteria style meal. It was a little pricey for a cafeteria but super convenient. Dinner did include salad, main, dessert, bread, and coffee / tea so that is probably why it was more pricey. Great gluten free options - a GF biscuit in the morning and special GF pie at night.

I will come back next year for the retreat and look forward to my stay here.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The good: Beautiful location. Fresh air and nature. Good prices compared to the area. Social room and cafe. Safe location. Staff is friendly. Might be able to hear the ocean when it is quiet enough. The neutral: No TV. (As advertised) Free wifi Not too close to other businesses, stores. Decent parking Clean as it could be The bad: No AC / fan. Hot stuffy room when it was cold outside. Had to figure out the right airflow with the windows. Thin walls, loud footsteps. (No TV or fan to quiet it) Dated rooms. Old carpet, scuffed walls, mystery stains.</text>< time>

The rooms itself were fine. The bathroom was a little bit outdated but the fire place was really nice. The location was perfect, 5 minutes walking from the beach!< /review>

The rooms are kind of basic, but it is part of the history of the place. Food is average. Awesome location though. Gorgeous scenery.</text>

The beach access is right across from pebble beach golf course.

A great get away from it all, yet it still offers wi fi for the melancholic amongst us.

<Text>Check-in was agonizingly slow. Not because there was a line, but because the desk attendant was apparently new and unfamiliar with the computer screens, with nobody there to help her. Room was 90 degrees, thermostat was stuck on even at coolest setting. Housekeeping promised to report it and I separately spoke directly to maintenance; NOTHING was done. I spent the rest of my stay turning furnace fan on to warm up and off to avoid roasting--so getting up in a cold room was unpleasant every morning. Maintenance was generally poor; headboard had fallen off wall and basin sink cold water valve was loose in fixture and will soon leak. At its best, this is a conference center dorm -- no TV, no in-room phones, no fridge, no in-room coffee. Parking is atrocious, plan on a hike to your car.</Text><user_name>Eric Artman</user_name>< user_id>

I have attended a conference every 1.5 to 2 years or so at Asilomar for the past 14 years . Every visit brings updated amenities. I noticed the newly redone patio facing the meadow. Wi-Fi is in all rooms now. The catering is much improved. The Julia Morgan designed buildings are as beautiful as ever. The grounds and nearby beaches are wonderful. Deer everywhere! Raccoons are large and unafraid of humans.<//Review>

The grounds are scenic and tranquil. It's easily a hotel where you can spend most of your day simply walking around. The rooms are sub-par, but liveable, and worth the price once you consider the benefits the hotel provides.< /text>

This places like staying in your grampa and grandmas bedroom but way less fun lol.  We spent a grand total of 2 minutes in the room before we ask for a refund and got the heck out of there.  Room had no amenities no mirror in the bathroom it stunk and was very dirty.

This place seems like it would be good for people that want complete silence and to be in the middle of nature with no distractions, but that is not the experience they were looking for.

It's probably my own fault for not investigating me hotel a little more but I didn't know they still made hotels that were this basic.</Review>

We chose this location as we were attending a wedding receiption there. The reviews were mediocre but it was an easy pick with a baby. The checkin was easy and friendly but it stopped being fun there. The drive to the parking lot was far and then when we got there, we had to walk a ways to the room. The room appears to be original from 1980 and had a musky smell as well as a strong urine odor in the restroom. The walls were paper thin and we could hear a normal conversation next door as well as the maid banging around early the next morning. To top it off, they rudely decided to tell us 25 minutes before 11 that we needed to leave even though we were clearly on our way out. I'm happy to support our amazing state parks but unfortunately this appears to be another poorly managed Aramark (same one with a number of employment law violations) facility.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Very disappointing. It took us 40 minutes to find where our room is in the darkness because you have to park far away from where your room actually is. Then when I entered the room there was only one bed, one desk, and one chair - Note that we book the most EXPENSIVE room. There was only one bedside table so you have to assume the people sleeping on the other side don't need it. Their pictures are very deceiving. Then we went to the dinner across from the place but the walk their was equally dark and without any sidewalk so you can easily be hit by a car. The room key sometimes work and sometimes don't so we have to actually climb in from the porch. And after paying for the price that was enough to say in a five-star hotel, you will find that breakfast is not included. Also despite that our room was by the sea, the sea was on the wrong direction, so you would NOT be able to see either the sun rise or the sun set. Overall, I would not recommend this place to other people - it is a waste of your money. It is OK if you want to cut your cost and have a rundown place like this, but it is NOT right to put up pictures that are actually not true at all in order to get money from customers.</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Fantastic hotel even tho it’s super old or so it seems the fact that it’s a walking distance to the beach is simply AMAZING! I stayed here for the event Sony Kando Trip 2.0 and even tho there’s not a lot of lights at night I felt safe walking to the Manzanita building by myself at 1am after my Astro Photography class. If you’re thinking of relaxing next to the beach and watching every sunset I would recommend this hotel because you don’t need to be in the room get out an explore the beauty Mother Nature gives us! Watch ever sunset you won’t regret it that’s exactly what I did catches every sunset while I attended the event.😊♥️< /review>

The location is phenomenal: nestled in Monterey Pine and Live Oak forest, bored by a beautiful and unique dune habitat, and immediately adjacent to Asilomar beach. Beautiful architecture by Julia Morgan (of Hearst Castle fame) in the Arts and Crafts style. Unfortunately this place is quite pricey and I couldn't afford to stay on site during the conference I attended here.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>I attended a scientific conference at Asilomar. As someone who has attended several conferences at a variety of hotels, Asilomar was a lackluster venue. My biggest complaint is that the wifi was very weak, in both our rooms and in the main conference Hall. This made it extremely difficult to do work, which was ostensibly the purpose of the trip. The food was also just fine. There were limited options- it felt much more like a college dining hall than a grown up conference venue. The view at Asilomar was great, however. Unfortunately, the nearest beach was experiencing a bloom of kelp flies that covered the sand in a carpet making the beach difficult to enjoy. Overall Asilomar was adequate but would not rank in my top percent of conference venues.</text>< pics>

The location is good and ground is well kept. But the room is as barebone as possible. My guess is that they may want to keep the rustic feeling??? Perhaps a dorm room is better than this. The room smells terrible. The Wi-fi barely works and is slower than what you get from the modem age. The room gets really dry with heating (you do need it since it gets fairly cold in the night with poor insulation) but they don’t have humidifier. Bathroom has cracked corners and crumbling wall paints. The sound insulation is perhaps nonexistent? I heard everything the lady next door for two whole hours. Thank god I don’t understand the language. The food is just ok except the pipe dripped from the ceiling onto our table. I gave a two star for the nice location and outside. The inside perhaps should get 1 star the most. Overall I would choose to stay in a different place.</Review>

I was not expecting this place to be a gem -architectural, historically, and for good old fashion R&R. If you are a fan of architecture and have been to Hearst Castle, make your way down here for the other side of Julia Morgan. Regardless of its beauty, you wont find a better place to spend you time.</text>

My company delivered a public workshop at the Fred Farr forum facility; It was fantastic. The room was set up beautifully beforehand, staff was available for special requests, the AV system worked flawlessly, the coffee and pastries were delicious, and they even lit a fire in the fireplace.< /text>

<text>The punch line is this is a geographically gorgeous place, but the "hotel" aspect is a huge letdown and left us feeling ripped off by offering an overpriced experience that does not compete with even the most budget class of motels.

The rooms are clustered into lodges that are reminiscent of summer camp cabins. On the outside, they fit in nicely with the surrounding scenery and are quite pretty - bonus is you can walk to the nearby beach in minutes. On the inside, these are 1960-70s-era rooms that don't appear to have been updated in decades, down to the butter yellow color scheme that permiated the room. Our room was large, but was furniture was scarce leaving it to feel very empty. Most the wood furniture was falling apart. Screens over the windows were warped so much you could fit your hand through the gap they left. Stains marked the curtains, carpet noticably.

I'd expect this if I was going to summer camp and staying in a cabin, not paying $200 a night for a "hotel". Other very noticeable missing features: our room had no TV, coffee maker, microwave, fridge, or even a phone (phone was in the hallway outside). We later learned you can "rent" a fridge from the front desk at something like $10 a night. Some of our friends note their room was upgraded - still without a TV, but theirs had a Keurig stocked only with decaf. It seems your mileage may vary on whether your room is upgraded or not. Others on here have mentioned incorrect or double billing at what seems like an alarming frequency, but that hasn't happened to us as of yet.

Ultimately, I would come for the scenery that this facility happens to be existing in, but the basic execution of the hotel aspect is embarrassingly bad.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

However, just wish they didn't nickel and dime you to death with their pricey snack shop and dining hall. To have to pay almost $3.00 for a cup of coffee is a bit much... that should be something guests can get without a meal ticket/purchase considering their room prices.<//Text><Date>1502403411888</Date><Response>None<//Response></record>

< review>
The accomodations need to be updated but the grounds, the main lodge and the boardwalk above the mighty Pacific are stunning. They've spent the money on the grounds and the common areas. Asilomar is a state park so there isn't unlimited cash to update all of the rooms, of which there are many and from different time periods. The original accomodations were designed by Julia Morgan. Other buildings were added in the 70's, 80's and 90's.
WiFi is sketchy. Best to leave your devices at home and plug into the mighty Pacific instead.<//review>

<text>The location is beautiful, the hotel is OK-ish. Checkin is at 4pm, checkout at 11am (why? the building we stayed in had maybe one other room occupied out of 20 or so rooms).

<text>Rustic accommodations. Had an ant problem in the room. Rooms had no tv (which I liked) and a fireplace stocked with wood.

<Text>We were looking forward to our trip and staying at this beautiful property only to be put in the furthest building on the property behind HR and next to facilities not even near the main entrance and had to park on the city street because there was not a parking lot for our building (woodside). I arrived at check in right at 4:00 so cant see it being a case of no other rooms being available. The building we were in was very old and dirty. There were visible stains on the carpets and there was a 2 inch gap under our front door so spiders came in our room. We were also the only ones in our building until around 8:30 when another group arrived. We arent snobby, high maintenance people and knew it was a historic hotel and saw what the photos looked like online but in person they did not look like this. Maybe its just the woodside building which adds to our feeling that we were shooed off to this building because we had a preschooler with us or because we got a large discount on the night through travelocity. I really, really wanted to love asilomar but am just left dissapointed.</Text>< Pics>

Beautiful setting. OK accommodations if you like tiny rooms with tiny beds in really old buildings. Food isn't very good.</Text>

One of the most stunning conference grounds located in California. Very rustic accommodations, ideal for a getaway to unplug and focus on nature.< /review>

The heater was rattling so loudly it woke us up even when we did get to sleep.  The walls are so thin that you can hear every conversation in neighboring rooms.  The rooms look like they haven't been remodeled since 1950.  The grounds and common spaces look beautiful, but I just can't get over the poor quality rooms.</Review><user_name>Eric Seppanen</user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

Asilomar is ok.

Depends on the size of your conference, your experience may vary. For a large conference, meeting rooms could get crowded and uncomfortably warm even in the spring. Having meals would be a headache.

Otherwise, Asilomar provides quaint cabins and meeting room converted from old church and access to a small beach. Not sure if it is allowed, but we've done bonfire on the beach.<//Text>

A good deal if you just need a room near the beach.  Not completely modern but comfortable enough.< /Review>

<Review>The actual place didn't look like the pictures. The rooms are dirty and outdated and don't even have a phone to use to call the front desk. The view of the beach and the distance to the beach are misleading from what we saw online. We canceled our second night and stayed elsewhere.</Review><time>1525639721464< /time></record>

When planning our 25th anniversary I wanted to make the occasion something special for my wife and I. My parents were so excited to hear the next generation was going to enjoy Asilomar again. I am sad to say that the experience was not what we expected.
•	We were booked into the wrong room. This despite calling the 888 number twice stating that ours was a special occasion – our 25th anniversary. Regardless, we were booked into a tiny room with two tiny twin beds. This despite the fact that I am 6’5”! Prior to being assigned this room we were assigned one with four beds! I made it quite clear that it was just my wife and I.
•	Upon our arrival we were checked-in by Mia. She made no mention of our special occasion. Initially I was stunned by her lack of attention to this important detail, the whole reason for our stay! My wife and I felt insulted and humiliated though we said nothing at the time.
•	The room we were assigned had no ability to cool the room, there was no AC. The room became uncomfortably hot our 2nd night, I was almost sweating. At 2:00am I went to the Front Desk to complain. Feeling frustrated and upset, I really unloaded on her. I told her everything in this letter. She was very sweet and compassionate. She gave us a fan. Being Monterey, it did not surprise me that there was no AC. What was surprising was that there was no way to securely leave the sliding glass door open while sleeping or away. What prevented this was a folding security bar that, when in position, prevented the sliding glass door from opening at all. We did not feel safe in a room at street level with nothing preventing entry to our room via the balcony, if the sliding glass door was unlocked. Maybe more importantly, we did not see a single security person anywhere on the property during our three-day stay. I found this to be un-settling considering all the random acts of violence that occur almost daily in the United States.
•	The lock/latch on our sliding door also did not work. The only way it could be locked was using the folding bar.
In summary, we were very disappointed with our stay for the reasons stated. I very much want to see the Asilomar succeed for generations to come. I look forward to bringing our daughter one day. It is my hope that you will bring Asilomar back up to par with what it used to be, and on par with today’s other fine hotels.< /Review>

A historical hotel built in the early 1900s, it seems like it hasn't been renovated since the early 1900s.  The grounds could be beautiful, but much of the vegetation is dying or dead, as are the trees.

The photos on the website are clearly staged to show the best angles in the best lighting with heavy photoshop enhancement.< /Text>

<Text>The location of this place is beautiful and breathtaking! It is right by the ocean and sunsets are gorgeous. The food was really delicious and the chef tried to have a diverse menu which was different each night. This is an ideal place for a retreat or scientific merting. The only negative point are the rooms. the rooms look like they have not been updated since the 1980. They have a nice cabin feel. If you are looking for a retreat disconnected from the outside world, this is the destination. But if you are looking place to do someoffice work, it maybe challenging. The WiFi is spotty and at some places non existent. There is no TV in the rooms. But the location and the food more than compensates for that!<//Text>< Pics>

Remember the song about Camp Grenada???  So that.  These pictures are WAY TOO nice looking.  None of the rooms looked like this.  It was NOT as nice as a motel 6.

Our room was literally leaking from the ceiling for 3 mornings in a row from the people upstairs apparently not using the shower correctly.  woke us at 5am everyday thank you.  Management did not handle appropriately even though we addressed it everyday and now won't respond other than giving me a free glass of wine.  LOL!!! Really??  Mold in all showers of everyone I spoke with.  Can't make beds properly, short sheeted the bottom sheet so I woke up wrapped in the disgusting mattress pad.   Food tasted mostly good, but many of us got mysteriously sick with a horrible sinus cold at the same time.  kind of thinking the cooks or preps might have contribute to that.  If there is another event going on don't try to sleep.  The raccoons tried to attack me several times while I was eating a snack on my tiny dirty porch.  the cleaning crew for the rooms did not stock any amenities.  The most shocking was when I walked in to grab something from my room and the cleaning crew had ALL my bed pillows on the floor while making my bed.  I made them change the pillow cases and they treated me like I was crazy.

the boardwalk was nice.

Of our group of 45, approx. 20 of us disliked it.  Not good odds folks, try a lot harder.< /text>

We checked into the hotel and was given a map. 1/2 hour later we found the building, but had no way of getting to the building without going through another building with out access and had no parking close to our room. No air conditioning.</Review>

Joke with the family that Asilomar is lazy camping. It's a hotel in the Monterey area but it's also a state park.

Day one, check into room, visit beach, walk around facility. Dinner in Monterey, aquarium at night, then back to lodge to play pool and board games.

Day 2 swim in heated pool, cruise the beach trails, shopping in town, aquarium, dinner out then back to hotel by 7 to sit around outside camp fire pit and roast marshmallows.

There is no TV in rooms, but as a parent we don't travel anywhere without a laptop or tablet or both. The wifi is strong and easily streamed movies of Netflix.

My teens favorite aspect was the beds. Queen plus three twins. My daughter didn't need to share a bed with her younger, wiggly siblings.<//text>

<text>The rooms and service are great and very nature friendly. There are no tvs in the room. The WiFi is choppy which would be great if I was here on vacation. The rooms are very old which comes with its problems but the friendly staff is eager to help. Food/Beverage is fairly expensive but the meals are above average.<//text></record>

<review>We stayed here for two nights while exploring the northern end of Big Sur. The price was a bit more moderate than anything IN Big Sur, but still a bit high for such basic accommodation.

That said, we loved it! It felt a bit like adult summer camp with hotel-style lodges and rooms set in a forested area within walking distance of the beach. Campfires were lit up around the property, but, unfortunately for us, they were all private fires for groups staying on the grounds. We paid a bit extra for a balcony and wished we could have spent more time out there, just enjoying the trees. (Actually, a coffeepot in the room would have been great. And if you care, there was no TV.)

The biggest downfall was the poor sound proofing. We could hear EVERYTHING the people in the next room said. Also, at 6 am one of the mornings, I heard a knock at the door and someone started keying into our room. I leapt out of bed, only to discover it was not our room. It sounded so close, I could have sworn it was.

Cute old facility, right next to the ocean. Nice rooms, although they are lacking in modern facilities (no phones, no hairdryers, no TVs, although they do have WiFi). A little over-priced, perhaps, but that's CA. The breakfast is worth paying for, too.<//review>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Better than excellent in every way; attended a scottish dancing weekend here and liked it so much stayed another week; all rooms are spacious except the "historic" ones and they have shower not a bath.
Set in quiet grounds with mature trees, deer, squirrels, racoons, birds and within a short walk of the ocean.
There is a large communal room with roaring fire, piano & billiard table.
Staff, especially Kim friendly and helpful.
Easy driving distance of all Montery Bay attractions.
Love it; visit it!!!!!</Text><Date>1383924943689< /Date>< user>

Great compound with romantic flair near the ocean. Just stay away from the breakfast - overpriced,  limited selection and really not that good.< /Review>

<gmap_id>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519< /gmap_id><text>For several years we have driven by the Asilomar Conference Grounds during our vacations to the Monterey Bay Area.  We finally decided to book a trip to stay at the property.  We booked 3 nights and upon check in, found that we were in a non ocean view room and asked if there were ocean view rooms available.  The woman checking me in said yes and it was a $40 per night upgrade.  I said yes and as she was finishing checking me in the employee next to her was checking someone else in and that person also wanted an upgraded ocean view room and was quoted only $22 per night.  So, essentially, I paid $54 more because I checked in with a different person.

When I arrived at the building where our room was, we could see the ocean at a distance, much further away from the water than I was led to believe.  I quickly realized we would not be enjoying our view.  You could not see the ocean unless you were in the bed (the sitting area in the room had no view).  The building is designed with the walkway passing in front of each room.  So anyone walking to and from their rooms can look directly in to any room with the curtains open.  Now imagine you are laying in bed (the only place in the room where you can see the ocean) and every other guest that walks by makes eye contact with you.  A little creepy.  Needless to say, we kept our blinds closed most of the trip.

I was also a little dismayed that there are no land line phones in the room, so you better have a cell carrier with coverage.  Also, there are no Televisions in the room.  Final complaint....coffee.  There is not a coffee maker in the room, which means for a morning cup of coffee you have to drive to the main building and pay $2 for a simple cup of coffee each morning.

My vision for this trip with my wife is to lounge around the room with an ocean view....waking up in the morning and enjoying a cup of coffee in bed with a beautiful view.  Instead, we had to wake up, drive to the main building and buy coffee, and then sit in a room with the blinds closed so people were not staring at us as they walked by.

Lesson learned and romantic vacation ruined.</text><Resp>None</Resp><userid>112763982955886412314<//userid><Pictures>None</Pictures><time>1397584316050<//time>< rate>

The cafe and store in the center aren't very good with overly priced food for average and even poor food. The smores kit is extremely overpriced and the firepit is complicated and not particularly well explained. The hotel itself is nice if basic and there is a limit to plug sockets but you can get around it. The beds are wierdly arranged as well. There is a short walk to the beach and it is incredible with alright views, extremely soft sand and an ice cold sea. There is a swimming pool but it is a long walk from the hotels at the far end. The placement of this hotel is brilliant, a short drive (or a medium length walk) from Monterey and the incredible aquarium. Overall we could and should of stayed in Monterey longer and the hotel was up to standards</review>

<name>Charles Yeh< /name><Review>Location is right next to the Asilomar State Beah/Park. Hotel rooms are mediocre, the primary attraction here is location. Primary complaint is probably that the hotel is extremely stingy on food. You get meal tickets; you lose them, you don't eat unless you buy another one. No seconds either.<//Review>< pics>

<text>If you are expecting some posh lodging and/or high-end dining experience... you've come to the wrong place. This is [not] what this place is about.

This place is basically a nice high-end camp. Its not as nice as a nice hotel, but its nicer than any camp I've ever been to. Meals are pre-set both in selection and time you can eat them in the dining hall, the food is very good though.

There is no phone or television in your room but this is by design. You're supposed to be getting away from it all after all!  There is wifi... it is a little ify but better than some I've seen at some hotels. Cellular coverage on my AT&T phone seems to be pretty good too.

There are deer running around all over the place (which is pretty cool). The beach on the ocean is within walking distance (also nice).

The bad part: The front desk. ..
- Get there early? Want to have your luggage put behind the desk so that your not stuck in the lobby waiting for your room to get ready? Tough.
- Want to book a room for an extra night at the front desk. Tough. You have to go to their web site to do it.

The way the front desk is run is abysmal. Otherwise the place is very nice.</text>< Pics>

The rooms we stayed in were fairly dated (no fridge, no microwave) BUT the location is pretty unbeatable...a short walk to the beaches on 17 mile drive, a small pool that's great for kids, some wonderful views of the ocean, all for a reasonable price.< /Review>

Great main lodge at Christmas, but the rooms need udating badly, no air conditioning, and the men's bathroom was broken in the dining hall so I had to go as all the way up to the club house in the freezing cold just to use the bathroom for a meal that costs $40!<//Text>

<response>None</response><Text>We have had many enjoyable stays at Asilomar over the years, so revisiting after a pause of eight years had the potential to start a new chapter in our relationship with this place.  Unfortunately, a number of factors weighed heavily on our experience.  First, whereas we always stayed within the main compound, this time we were put in a room across the road.  We could still hear the ocean, but traffic on the access road (Asilomar Ave.) was audible.  The room was clean and tidy but quite worn down, with sliding doors not fitting properly, faucets/shower/toilet never updated (which is odd considering the need to conserve water in this area), and no coffee-maker, cups or etc. as amenities in a room that, with a senior discount, cost around $150 per night.  No breakfast included, although one could purchase full fare at $18 per person, or go to the cafe next to the front desk.  One of our biggest disappointments was the decline of the Monterey pine grove due to pitch canker disease.  Trees are suffering and are left to fall of their own accord, and so look quite pathetic on the way down.  Several large trees that had collapsed over by the swimming pool were especially skeletal and sad to see.  While it's admirable the resort is replanting these trees, it'll take decades before they are even half the size of the originals.  On the two days in mid-March 2016 we were there (Thurs. and Fri.) the nearby Asilomar beach smelled like decaying organic material...so much so I thought a whale had gotten trapped in underwater rocks and was rotting away.  Wanting a nice beach to stroll along, we went to Carmel's famous Sunset beach.  While pleasant, we found it overrun with dogs off leash, having a great time at the expense of folks like us who just wanted to experience the surf without barking and dog scuffles.  Like any review, these opinions are subjective and so readers can ignore them and experience Asilomar on their own.  For a conference, it might still be great, but for casual visitors, there needs to be concerted attention to upgrading and enhancing the experience of spending a couple nights.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808de1301ce496cb:0x763d96cf8eb0e519</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Pros : close to the beach,  monterey Bay,  beautiful grounds,
Cons : very dated rooms, found 1 cockroach or something similar, no TV (could be an advantage), practically no wifi (1 bar)</review>

Expansive conference facility in prime spot on the Monterey Peninsula. The rooms, however are plain to the point of seeming cheap.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The silence of dawn with fog, the general landscape.
This is a place to retreat, everything and designed to relax and enjoy the scenery. Comfortable cottages with a fireplace, keep you out of the world. It does not have a TV, minibar or coffee maker, but they do grant ironing facilities. As I had lunch in a group, I do not know if there is a daily meal available, I did not see anyone who was not at a conference, symposium or meeting in the cafeteria, but the food is served with choices between two dishes, which are served. No bar, water or tea available. But I liked the options, always stuffed with vegetables. On the property there is a cafeteria with coffee, dishes and snacks, all natural and organic. No fries, sodas and hamburgers. Many trails, a heated pool, blocks of dirt. Dunes and dunes to lose sight of.
Kind, helpful and friendly staff. Go to shut down just world.

(Original)
O silêncio do amanhecer com névoa, a paisagem geral.
Este é um lugar para retiro, tudo e pensado para relaxar e aproveitar a paisagem. Chalés confortáveis com lareira, te mantém fora do mundo. Não tem tv, frigobar ou cafeteira, mas fazem concessão ao ferro de passar. Como almocei em um grupo, não sei se tem refeição diária disponível, não vi ninguém que não estive em congresso, simpósios ou encontros no refeitório, mas a comida é servida com escolhas entre dois pratos, que são servidos. Não t bar, disponível água ou chá. Mas gostei das opções, sempre recheadas de legumes. Na propriedade existe uma lanchonete com café, pratos e petiscos, tudo natural e orgânico. Nada de fritas, refrigerantes e hambúrguer..  Muitas trilhas, uma piscina aquecida  quadras de terra. Dunas e dunas para perderde vista.
Equipe gentil, prestativa e amigável. Vá para se desligar só mundo.< /Review>

<Text>La propreté laisse a désirer. Nous avions beaucoup de fourmis dans notre chambre. Aucune aire climatisé. Même si nous ouvrions les fenêtres aucune aire ne rentrait dans la chambre malgré les nuits fraîches. Rideaux sales. La fenetre bouge dans son cadre...une bonne rénovation des lieux aiderait à profiter du potentiel de la place. Aucune insonorisation.<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Although this hotel is booked to see the scenery, it is too exaggerated.
1. As soon as you check in, there will be a smell running out, no phone can tell
2. When Cheak-in did not say that there is a deposit, and it is listed on the card bill
3. Poor waiter attitude

(Original)
雖然這間飯店是訂來看風景的，可是未免也太誇張了。
1.一入住就有一股臭味跑出，無電話可以告知
2.Cheak-in時沒有說有押金，且列再性用卡帳單上
3.服務員態度差</text>

(Translated by Google) Right on the beach, nice rooms, ours had a fireplace. There was a smell of old wood in the house, but that did not bother us. Otherwise we were very happy with the accommodation.

(Original)
Direkt am Strand, schöne Zimmer, unseres hatte einen Kamin. Es roch im Wohnhaus etwas nach altem Holz, aber das hat uns nicht gestört. Ansonsten waren wir sehr zufrieden mit der Unterkunft.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very nice site. However, we were certainly assigned one of the worst rooms: no balcony, seen over a noisy log cabin (probably housing a pump), paint on the walls crumbling. Too bad, because otherwise, once again, the site is very beautiful. We were able to observe deer roaming freely and walking near the sea.

(Original)
Très beau site. Cependant, nous nous sommes vu attribué certainement l'une des pires chambres: pas de balcon, vu sur une cabane en bois bruyante (abritant probablement une pompe), peinture des murs qui s'effrite. Dommage, car sinon, encore une fois, le site est très beau. Nous avons pu observer des cerfs se promenant librement et se promener à proximité de la mer.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Stylish hotel, attentive reception staff, parking of the buildings in the rooms quite confusing and in some cases with difficult access, the vacancies are far from the rooms. Large and tidy rooms, but they do not have TV, nor do they have a mini fridge or microwave and coffee maker.

(Original)
Hotel elegante, funcionários da recepção atenciosos, estacionamento dos prédios dos quartos bastante confusos e em alguns casos com difícil acesso, as vagas ficam longe dos quartos. Quartos grandes e arrumados porém não contam com TV, nem frigobar nem microondas e cafeteira.</Text>

<text>Asilomar hat eine sehr gemütliche Atmosphäre. Unser Zimmer war sehr einfach, aber absolut okay und mit einem wunderschönen Ausblick auf den Pacific.Die gemütliche Halle läd zum Billard spielen und lesen am Kaminfeuer ein.Schön angelegte Holzstege zum Spaziergang am Strand, Fahräder zur Radtour nach Monterey und 17 miles drive.Frühstück im großen Saal mit vielen Menschen muss man mögen.Nette Begegnungen dafür inklusive!Rehe sind direkt vor der Tür, Waschbären auch.Der Pool war zum Baden eine gute Alternative zum wilden Meer.Die Lage und der Expedia-Spezialpreis hatten den Ausschlag für diese Hotelwahl gegeben.Damit würden wir auf jeden Fall nochmal hierher reisen.< /text></record>

(Translated by Google) Dilapidated room
120cm bed for two people
Old Formica 70s bathroom, clean limit
Friendly setting
Glass not cleaned since construction!
In the trails it's downright weird gloomy atmosphere and if by misfortune you move away it is dirty my wife was scared!
Ants full the room we slept in company :)
It hasn't changed for 40 years

I don't know how people rate on Google !!!
Or hoteliers buy their notes!

shame given the price paid
Frédéric mahaut

Chambre vétuste
lit en 120cm pour deux personnes
Salle de bain vielle Formica année 70 limite propre
Cadre sympathique
Vitre non nettoyé depuis la construction !
Dans les sentiers c est carrément bizarre ambiance glauque et si par malheur vous vous éloignez la c est sale ma femme a eu peur !
Fourmis plein la chambre on a dormis en compagnie :)
Cela n a pas bouger depuis 40 ans

Je ne sais pas comment note les gens sur Google !!!
Ou les hôteliers achètent leurs notes !

la honte vu le prix payé

(Translated by Google) The location of the place is excellent ... Near many attractions of the passiferous coast, the facilities are with a rustic design ... And they need a little maintenance, the food has been exceptional, and the service also, rooms clean but quite old It has been a very good experience in general.

(Translated by Google) Superb site but lifeless to leave that of some seniors asleep on the sofa in the lobby.
We have had hotels without a refrigerator or microwave, but here it is without the 2 and without coffee or tv or even a phone to contact the lobby. Fortunately there is the fireplace for long evenings.
Service little or not responsive. We reported 2 times a lighting failure in the bathroom, we stayed in the dark the morning of our departure.

(Original)
Site superbe mais sans vie à pars celle de quelques séniors endormis sur le canapé du lobby.
Nous avons connu des hôtels sans réfrigérateur ou sans micro-ondes, mais ici c'est sans les 2 et sans café ni tv ni même un téléphone pour contacter le lobby. Heureusement qu'il y a la cheminée pour les longues soirées.
Service peu ou pas réactif. Nous avons signalé 2 fois une panne d'éclairage dans la salle de bain, nous sommes resté dans le noir le matin de notre départ.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Food: Breakfast is the best, lunch and dinner are boring and insufficient especially if you are hungry. Place. A bit old and boring, they do not have a bar open until the evening. It's like the name says: Isolated

(Original)
Comida: El desayuno es lo mejor, la comida y cena son aburridas e insuficientes especialmente si estas hambriento. Lugar. un poco viejo y aburrido, no tienen un bar abierto hasta la noche. Está como su nombre los dice: Aislado< /review>
